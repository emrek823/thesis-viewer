## The Take

**RUSP creates the first policy-mandated demand funnel for gene therapy—DMD (~360 cases/year) and MLD screening now force early diagnosis, but commercial model failures (Bluebird: 57 patients across 3 therapies; Pfizer Beqvez: 0 patients post-approval) and Elevidys safety restrictions (ambulatory-only after 2 deaths) extend the $5B market to 2030+.**

The mechanism is confirmed: RUSP additions for conditions with approved gene therapies invert the traditional adoption challenge. Universal screening (3.6M US births/year) catches patients at the optimal treatment window before symptom onset. ACA mandates cost-sharing-free coverage for RUSP screenings.

But execution risk is VERY HIGH. State implementation takes 5-10 years on average (SCID/CCHD took 6.8-8.6 years). Only 14 states have RUSP alignment legislation. ACHDNC termination in April 2025 creates a "dangerous vacuum" with no replacement structure. And the gene therapy commercial model is broken: Takeda ($394M impairment), Galapagos (365 layoffs), Novo Nordisk (250 layoffs), Pfizer (discontinued Beqvez with ZERO patients treated) all exited CGT in 2025.

**In 3-5 years:** RUSP creates the demand floor that gene therapy manufacturers needed—but only for pediatric conditions with newborn screening. State adoption of DMD/MLD screening will reach ~30 states by 2028, with full adoption by 2030-2032. The market reaches $3-5B cumulative by 2030, not 2028. Winners: Sarepta (if Elevidys safety data stabilizes), Orchard/Kyowa Kirin (Lenmeldy for MLD), specialty stop-loss providers. Losers: self-insured employers facing catastrophic claims, gene therapy manufacturers without RUSP-linked conditions.

**How this evolved:**
- *2026-01-26:* **REBUILD** — 7 contrarian queries. HIGH THREATS: (1) Elevidys restricted to ambulatory-only after 2 deaths, Q4 revenue missed estimates; (2) Gene therapy commercial model broken (Bluebird sold $50M, Pfizer Beqvez 0 patients, Takeda/Galapagos/Novo exiting); (3) State implementation takes 5-10 years average. TITLE CHANGED: Extended timeline from 2028 to 2030+. Confidence: MEDIUM → LOW.
- *2026-01-26:* Previous rebuild confirmed RUSP mechanism but identified manufacturer exits as material threat.
- *2025-12-28:* Added gene therapy commercial failure pattern analysis.
- *2025-12-22:* Created from DMD and MLD RUSP addition announcements.

## Mechanism

[HRSA] adds [CONDITIONS WITH APPROVED GENE THERAPIES] to [RUSP] because [EVIDENCE-BASED REVIEW RECOMMENDS EARLY DETECTION] → [MANDATORY SCREENING + COVERAGE CREATES PREDICTABLE DEMAND FUNNEL, BUT COMMERCIAL MODEL FAILURES + STATE IMPLEMENTATION LAG DELAY MARKET REALIZATION TO 2030+]

---

## Investment Take

**Today:** RUSP additions for conditions with approved gene therapies create a policy-mandated demand funnel that inverts traditional adoption challenges. Unlike adult rare disease (patients must self-identify, navigate insurance, find specialized centers), newborn screening identifies 100% of affected births at the optimal treatment window. The coverage mandate is real: "Non-grandfathered group health plans and health insurance issuers are required to cover screenings included in these HRSA-supported comprehensive guidelines without cost-sharing."

DMD (added Dec 2025) affects ~1 in 5,000 male births = ~360 new US cases/year. Elevidys (Sarepta) is priced at ~$3.2M but is now restricted to ambulatory patients only after 2 deaths from acute liver failure in March 2025. This reduces the addressable population by ~40%. MLD was added the same week—Lenmeldy (Orchard/Kyowa Kirin) is priced at $4.25M and received FDA approval in March 2024.

The consensus believes RUSP solves gene therapy's commercial problem. Actually, RUSP solves the demand problem but not the delivery problem. The gene therapy commercial model remains broken: Bluebird Bio sold for $50M (99.7% down from $10B peak) with only 57 patients starting treatment across three marketed therapies. Pfizer discontinued Beqvez (hemophilia B gene therapy) less than one year after FDA approval—ZERO patients received treatment. Takeda, Galapagos, and Novo Nordisk all exited cell/gene therapy in late 2025.

**In 3-5 years:** RUSP creates the demand floor that gene therapy needed—but state implementation is the binding constraint. Average time to full RUSP adoption: 5-10 years (SCID took 8.6 years; CCHD took 6.8 years). Only 14 states have RUSP alignment legislation requiring automatic adoption. ACHDNC termination in April 2025 creates process vacuum for future conditions.

Sarepta reported $898.7M Elevidys revenue in 2025 (vs. $2.12B company-wide expected), with Q4 revenue of $110.4M missing estimates. The company projects >$500M annual Elevidys revenue through 2027 in the narrower ambulatory-only population. If safety data stabilizes and non-ambulatory access resumes, the market expands significantly.

Winners: Sarepta (Elevidys), Orchard/Kyowa Kirin (Lenmeldy), specialty stop-loss providers with CGT actuarial models, CDMO manufacturers. Losers: self-insured employers facing $3-4M claims, stop-loss carriers without CGT products, gene therapy manufacturers without RUSP-linked conditions.

## The Counter Thesis

RUSP creates demand, but demand without viable commercial models just accelerates manufacturer exits. The gene therapy industry is in crisis—and RUSP doesn't fix it.

The pattern is clear: Bluebird Bio (57 patients across 3 approved therapies, sold for $50M), Pfizer Beqvez (ZERO patients post-FDA approval, discontinued within 1 year), Takeda ($394M impairment, exiting CGT), Galapagos (365 layoffs, shuttering CGT), Novo Nordisk (250 layoffs, abandoning CGT). Twenty layoff rounds occurred at CGT biotechs in Q1 2025 alone. Only Zolgensma exceeds $500M annual sales among 9 approved US gene therapies.

The operational reality is brutal: expensive, operationally complex products that move through narrow treatment-center bottlenecks into reimbursement systems built for chronic care. Manufacturing takes months per patient. Casgevy takes 5-6 months from cell collection to infusion. There's a 500% shortage of CGT manufacturing capacity.

Elevidys—the primary DMD gene therapy—is now restricted to ambulatory patients only after 2 deaths from acute liver failure. Q4 2025 revenue ($110.4M) missed estimates ($122M). The black box warning and indication restriction reduce the addressable population by ~40%.

State implementation is the binding constraint. SCID took 8.6 years for all-state adoption. CCHD took 6.8 years. Only 14 states have RUSP alignment legislation. ACHDNC termination creates "a dangerous vacuum" with no replacement structure for evaluating future RUSP additions.

If Sarepta's Elevidys safety profile doesn't improve, or if state implementation stalls, or if manufacturers continue exiting, the $5B market never materializes. RUSP creates the demand signal—it doesn't solve the delivery infrastructure problem, the manufacturing bottleneck, or the broken commercial model.

## Timeline

**Now → 2026:**
- State NBS programs begin DMD/MLD implementation planning
- 14 states with RUSP alignment legislation move toward automatic adoption
- Sarepta develops risk-mitigation approach for non-ambulatory Elevidys patients
- FDA requires post-marketing observational study for Elevidys (200 patients, 12+ months)
- Stop-loss carriers finalize 2026 gene therapy carve-out products
- Watch for: Sarepta non-ambulatory resumption; early adopter state implementation announcements

**2027 → 2029:**
- ~20-30 states screening for DMD/MLD (historically 50% adoption by year 4-5)
- Elevidys safety profile clarified; potential expansion back to non-ambulatory patients
- First birth cohort (~360 DMD patients/year) identified pre-symptomatically and reaching treatment age
- Gene therapy treatment volumes increase 2-3x vs. current
- Cumulative market reaches $1-2B

**2030+:**
- Full state adoption of DMD/MLD screening (historically 6.8-8.6 years for complete adoption)
- $3-5B cumulative market achieved
- RUSP pipeline continues—more conditions with gene therapies added (watch: PKU, Krabbe)
- Model becomes standard: RUSP addition = guaranteed demand funnel
- Second-generation gene therapies with improved safety profiles enter market

---

## Startup Opportunities

**1. Newborn Screening Lab Software**
- Why this follows: State NBS labs need software to manage expanded panels, integrate with gene therapy referral pathways, track outcomes. DMD/MLD screening requires new workflows.
- Wedge: Partner with first-mover states implementing DMD/MLD. Focus on 14 states with RUSP alignment legislation (CA, FL, TX, GA, NC, OH, AZ, IA, PA, MS, MD, TN, VA).
- Risk: Incumbent LIMS vendors upgrade; state procurement cycles are 12-24 months; tight budgets

**2. Gene Therapy Patient Navigation Platform**
- Why this follows: Post-diagnosis journey is complex—genetic counseling, specialty referrals, insurance appeals, treatment center coordination (only ~50 authorized Elevidys centers), long-term monitoring. Insurance denials are common despite RUSP coverage mandate.
- Wedge: Partner with Sarepta patient services; expand to other RUSP conditions. Build insurance appeal automation.
- Risk: Fragmented payer landscape; Medicaid dominates pediatric rare disease; manufacturers may vertically integrate

**3. Gene Therapy Stop-Loss Analytics**
- Why this follows: RUSP makes gene therapy claims predictable by condition prevalence. Self-insured employers need actuarial models. Stop-loss carriers without CGT products will face adverse selection.
- Wedge: Actuarial models built on RUSP screening prevalence data. Predictive analytics for birth cohort gene therapy risk.
- Risk: Large carriers (Nationwide) acquiring capabilities; reinsurance market tightens; regulatory uncertainty

**4. CDMO Capacity Aggregation Platform**
- Why this follows: 500% shortage of CGT manufacturing capacity. 18-month CDMO lead times. Manufacturers need capacity visibility and optimization.
- Wedge: Marketplace connecting gene therapy developers with available CDMO slots. Real-time capacity tracking.
- Risk: Large CDMOs have captive relationships; information asymmetry is their moat; pharma procurement is relationship-driven

## Watch For

**If RIGHT (thesis plays out):**
- State NBS programs announce DMD/MLD implementation timelines (2026-2027)
- Sarepta resumes Elevidys shipments to non-ambulatory patients with improved safety protocol
- Sarepta earnings calls mention "newborn screening" as demand driver
- Stop-loss carriers create RUSP-specific product categories (not just exclusions)
- New RUSP nominations for conditions with approved gene therapies proceed despite ACHDNC absence
- Gene therapy manufacturer (Sarepta, Orchard) reports volume increases tied to screening referrals

**If WRONG (thesis fails):**
- State implementation stalls beyond 2029 (budget constraints, political resistance, ACHDNC vacuum)
- Elevidys safety problems persist; non-ambulatory access never resumes
- Sarepta or Orchard exits market (following Bluebird/Pfizer pattern)
- Gene therapy manufacturers report production constraints limiting treatment despite diagnosis
- Stop-loss carriers successfully carve out all gene therapy coverage (shifting burden to Medicaid)
- Insurance denials prevail despite RUSP screening mandate; treatment access remains blocked

*Confidence: LOW — Core mechanism confirmed (RUSP = mandatory screening + coverage) but execution risk is VERY HIGH. Three material threats: (1) Elevidys restricted to ambulatory-only after 2 deaths, (2) Gene therapy commercial model broken (Bluebird 57 patients, Pfizer 0 patients, major exits), (3) State implementation takes 5-10 years. $5B market delayed to 2030+.*
*Last rebuilt: 2026-01-26*
*Contrarian threats: Elevidys safety restrictions (ambulatory-only, 2 deaths); commercial model failures (Bluebird $50M sale, Pfizer Beqvez 0 patients, Takeda/Galapagos/Novo exits); state implementation lag (5-10 years historical); ACHDNC termination creates RUSP vacuum; 500% manufacturing capacity shortage*
