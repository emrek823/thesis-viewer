# Payment Integrity AI Wins via Second-Pass Strategy—Data Accumulation Enables Upmarket Migration by 2028

## 1-2 Sentence Summary

AI-native payment integrity vendors deploy in second-pass behind incumbents (Cotiviti, Optum) because payers won't risk first-pass revenue → second-pass proves incremental ROI on "missed" savings → data accumulation enables upmarket migration as AI-first entrants demonstrate superior clinical content depth.

---

## Investment Take

**Today:**

The consensus says Cotiviti and Optum own payment integrity forever. They have the payer relationships, the clinical content libraries, and the scale. The contrarian view: **second-pass is an entry wedge, not a ceiling.**

AI-native entrants use a deliberate strategy:

1. **Accept second-pass positioning** — "We're not going to put you in a first-pass position, but you can look at the same data 30 days after Cotiviti does it." (Cotiviti Regional VP)

2. **Prove ROI on incremental savings** — Find dollars incumbents missed. Payers pay higher fees for incremental finds. "If you find more dollars, we'll even pay you a higher fee." (Cotiviti VP)

3. **Accumulate data advantage** — Every claim reviewed builds proprietary training data. AI improves faster than rules-based incumbents.

4. **Migrate upmarket** — Once proven in second-pass, negotiate first-pass position. Data advantage compounds.

**The mechanism:** AI entrants accept inferior positioning to get access to claims data → prove ROI by finding savings incumbents missed → data accumulation creates compounding advantage → payers shift first-pass to AI-native vendors as incumbents fail to match accuracy.

**The content moat:** Clinical content depth (specialty coding standards, AMA guidelines, InterQual criteria) matters more than AI quality. "What they're lacking is the base clinical content...hasn't invested in since the sale of Burgess to HealthEdge." (Cotiviti VP)

**In 3-5 years:**

- **Winners:** AI-native vendors with clinical content investment (specialty coding, evolving payer rules). Vendors who capture first-pass positions after proving in second-pass.
- **Losers:** Incumbents who underinvest in content and rely on legacy rules. Pure-AI plays without clinical depth.
- **Market structure:** AI-native vendors capture 30-40% of payment integrity market by 2028. Cotiviti/Optum retain enterprise but lose mid-market.

## Bull Case

- [x] **Second-pass proves ROI** — Payers explicitly offer second-pass with higher fees for incremental finds ([[tegus_cotiviti-holdings-inc_133802]])
- [x] **$100M+ annual savings gap** — "20 to one ROI is common for a Lyric or an Optum CES primary editor...north of $100 million a year in savings gap" ([[tegus_cotiviti-holdings-inc_133796]])
- [x] **Content depth is the real moat** — Clinical specialty standards investment differentiates, not AI compute ([[tegus_cotiviti-holdings-inc_133796]])
- [x] **Incumbents underinvesting** — "hasn't invested in [clinical content] since the sale of Burgess to HealthEdge" ([[tegus_cotiviti-holdings-inc_133796]])

---

## Bear Case

- [ ] **Incumbents acquire AI capabilities** — Cotiviti/Optum could acquire AI-native vendors to close gap
- [ ] **Payer switching costs** — Multi-year contracts and integration complexity slow migration
- [ ] **Content investment is expensive** — Building clinical specialty libraries requires domain expertise and time
- [ ] **First-pass incumbency is sticky** — Payers may not shift first-pass even with proven second-pass performance

## The Counter-Thesis

The strongest counter-argument is that Cotiviti and Optum have the resources to invest in AI and clinical content, closing the gap before upstarts can scale.

**Response:** Incumbents face the innovator's dilemma. Their revenue comes from existing rules-based systems. Investing in AI that cannibalizes existing products is organizationally difficult. The "sale of Burgess to HealthEdge" comment suggests Cotiviti is divesting rather than investing in content.

For this thesis to be wrong: Cotiviti would need to acquire 2+ AI-native payment integrity startups AND integrate them successfully within 24 months.

---

## Timeline

**Now → 2026:** AI-native vendors establish second-pass positions at mid-market payers. Prove ROI with 20-30% incremental savings over incumbents.

**2027 → 2028:** First migrations from second-pass to first-pass position. AI-native vendors capture 30-40% of new payment integrity contracts.

**2029+:** Market bifurcation. Incumbents retain large enterprise (United, Elevance) through switching costs. AI-native vendors dominate mid-market and regional plans.

---

## Startup Opportunities

**1. AI-Native Payment Integrity (Codoxo, Others)**
- Why this follows: Second-pass entry strategy is proven path
- Wedge: Mid-market payers frustrated with incumbent miss rates
- Risk: Incumbent acquisition before scale

**2. Clinical Content Platforms**
- Why this follows: Content depth is the moat, not AI
- Wedge: Specialty coding standards (cardiology, oncology, rare disease)
- Risk: Incumbents could partner for content

---

## Watch For

**If RIGHT (thesis plays out):**
- AI-native vendor announces first-pass contract at top-20 payer
- Cotiviti/Optum reports slowing growth or market share loss
- Multiple second-pass → first-pass migrations announced
- Payer RFPs explicitly require AI-native capabilities

**If WRONG (thesis fails):**
- Cotiviti acquires AI-native vendor and successfully integrates
- Second-pass vendors fail to migrate upmarket after 3+ years
- Payers extend incumbent contracts despite AI alternatives
