## 1-2 Sentence Summary

**Healthcare AI vendors** win through distribution channels (EHR partnerships, vendor referrals, M&A rollups) rather than AI model quality because **healthcare buyers discover vendors through existing relationships, integration expertise creates lock-in, and M&A provides captive customers faster than enterprise sales** → the winners are embedded channel partners and rollup platforms, not the best AI products sold direct.

---

## Investment Take

**Today:** Healthcare AI is not a model quality race. The technology is already commoditized—Assort drops abandonment from 40% to 4%, ZocDoc achieves 70% auto-resolution, voice AI achieves human-parity. The differentiation is distribution: who gets discovered, who integrates fastest, who owns the customer relationship.

Three mechanisms explain why distribution beats AI quality in healthcare:

**Mechanism 1: Channel Partnerships Beat Product Demos.** Healthcare practices don't run AI RFPs. They find vendors through existing vendor relationships, conferences, and peer referrals. Barrington Orthopedic found Assort through their imaging vendor (Nexus-MD) referral. Pacific Dental (1,200+ locations) chose PolyAI over Assort for "superior integrations and negotiation flexibility"—not better AI. TrustCare chose Flip after a colleague referral: "I just felt better about them." Discovery channel > AI sophistication. If you're not compatible with their EHR, you're not even evaluated.

**Mechanism 2: Integration Expertise Creates Lock-In.** Pinnacle Group chose Tennr because "they had a lot of experience API into Brightree... other guys said 'Yes, we can learn that'... It's really not something you learned." SleepQuest's integration took 7 months vs. 3-month expectation. First mover with EHR integration wins—Tennr has "no real competitors in referral space" despite relatively simple technology. SimonMed's CIO notes: "No player outside the radiology space has taken the time to understand the radiology landscape and ecosystem." Integration expertise is earned through painful deployments, not built in a sprint.

**Mechanism 3: M&A Beats GTM (RCM Rollups).** Acquiring RCM companies at 3-7x EBITDA provides captive customers, real workflow data, and distribution to deploy AI—transforming margins from 10% (labor-intensive) to 60%+ (AI-native). Ease achieves 80% gross margin on AI-driven work vs 20% on traditional services. In a fragmented $150B+ RCM market with no scaled incumbent, M&A creates distribution faster than enterprise sales. Pure-play AI vendors must convince health systems to rip-and-replace; rollup players already own the customer relationship.

**MAJOR THREAT (from contrarian research):** Voice AI commoditization is real. Menlo Ventures reports "customers view scribing as becoming commoditized, and current switching costs are low." 67% of outpatient providers indicated they would switch vendors in the next 3 years. Epic's native AI scribe (launching early 2026 at rumored $80/provider/month vs. startup $600/month) poses existential risk to point-solution players. This is why distribution-strong companies are racing to expand beyond single use cases—becoming platforms, not features.

**In 3-5 years:** The healthcare AI market bifurcates into two winning models.

The first winning model is **EHR-Embedded Partners**—companies that secured privileged channel partnerships before commoditization. These are the Abridges and Tennrs who moved from point solution to platform, expanding across the value chain before Epic/horizontal players bundle their core feature. Abridge is already partnering with Highmark Health for real-time prior authorization. Ambience pitches revenue integrity and coding alongside documentation. The wedge product becomes the trojan horse for a broader workflow platform.

The second winning model is **RCM Rollup Platforms**—PE-backed roll-ups that acquire at services multiples (3-7x EBITDA) and transform to software economics (80% GM). These platforms own captive distribution through acquired customer bases and use AI to automate workflows that were previously labor-intensive. The rollup IS the software strategy: distribution first, AI second.

The losers are **AI-First Companies Without Distribution**—startups with better models but no channel partnerships, forced to sell direct against EHR-embedded competitors. Also **Point-Solution Pure-Plays**—companies that didn't expand beyond their initial wedge before commoditization, now facing $80/month Epic bundles. And **New Entrants Post-2027**—the integration expertise moat means late entrants face 6-12 month implementation timelines while incumbents measure in weeks.

Market structure: 2-3 dominant platforms per EHR ecosystem (Epic partners, athena partners, etc.) + 3-5 scaled RCM-AI platforms from rollup strategy + horizontal players (Sierra, Reducto) owning admin layer but not clinical workflows.

**How this evolved:**
- *2025-12:* Multiple Tegus calls revealed same pattern: AI found via referral, not evaluation
- *2025-12-29:* Split from "EHR Integration and Distribution Win Provider AI"
- *2026-01-04:* **REBUILD v1** - 17 sources on channel partnerships
- *2026-01-07:* **MERGED** RCM Rollups thesis — unified insight: distribution (channels, M&A, integration expertise) beats AI quality
- *2026-01-07:* **REBUILD v2** - Contrarian research pressure-tested thesis. Major threats: Epic native AI (HIGH), voice AI commoditization (MEDIUM-HIGH), horizontal platforms (MEDIUM). Thesis mechanism CONFIRMED but point-solution vulnerability elevated to critical risk.

## Bull Case

- [x] **Vendor referrals drive discovery, not direct sales.** Barrington Ortho found Assort via Nexus-MD imaging vendor referral. TrustCare chose Flip after colleague recommendation. ([[chief-executive-officer-at-barrington-orthopedic-specialists-21d19bd0]], [[3-assort-health-_-interviews-_-tegus-company-profile-c5b880a3]])

- [x] **EHR integration trumps AI quality.** Pacific Dental (1,200+ locations) chose PolyAI over Assort for "superior integrations and negotiation flexibility." Retina practice only evaluated vendors with Athena connectivity. ([[Assort Health _ Interviews _ Tegus Company Profile]])

- [x] **Integration expertise is a moat, not easily learned.** Pinnacle Group: "We chose Tennr because they had a lot of experience API into Brightree... other guys said 'Yes, we can learn that'... It's really not something you learned." SleepQuest: Integration took 7 months vs. 3-month expectation. ([[tennr-pinnacle-group-7764e76c]], [[tennr-sleepquest-b48eb7eb]])

- [x] **Availability beats intelligence.** Assort: 40%→4% abandonment proves value is 24/7 availability, not AI sophistication. Patients call 40-50 times/day just to confirm appointments after text confirmation. ([[Assort Health _ Interviews _ Tegus Company Profile]])

- [x] **Referrals have no real competition—first mover wins.** Tennr: "300-400% efficiency improvement," 9.5/10 rating, "no real competitors in referral space." SimonMed CIO: "billions of dollars left on table" in referral conversion (only 66% national average). ([[Tennr MPOWERHEALTH]], [[chief-innovation-officer-at-simonmed-imaging-_-tennr-_-tegus-224eecf0]])

- [x] **Fax elimination is massive opportunity.** "Healthcare in 2025 still is mostly fax and phone calls." DME/infusion still 90%+ handwritten fax. SimonMed integrates with 100+ different EMRs from tens of thousands of referring PCPs. ([[cmo-carbon-health---artera-and-hellopatient-d4d47d29]], [[chief-innovation-officer-at-simonmed-imaging-_-tennr-_-tegus-224eecf0]])

- [x] **Large practices prove ROI.** Barrington Ortho: 7→4.5 FTEs saved. TrustCare: "Downsized 22 people at avg $50K/year." SimonMed projects "75% workforce reduction" potential via AI. 8-12x ROI validated. ([[chief-executive-officer-at-barrington-orthopedic-specialists-21d19bd0]], [[3-assort-health-_-interviews-_-tegus-company-profile-c5b880a3]])

### M&A as Distribution
- [x] **M&A transforms margins faster than GTM.** Ease achieving 80% gross margin on AI-driven work vs 20% on traditional services. Acquire at 3-7x EBITDA, transform to software multiples. ([[ease_sept2025-a16z-rcm-roll-up-212465b1]])
- [x] **Rollup creates captive distribution.** Pure-play AI vendors must convince health systems to rip-and-replace; rollup players already own the customer relationship. ([[ease_sept2025-a16z-rcm-roll-up-212465b1]])
- [x] **No scaled incumbent in RCM.** Market fragmented enough for rollup strategy to work—$150B+ market without dominant player. ([[ease_sept2025-a16z-rcm-roll-up-212465b1]])
- [x] **80% of health systems adopting GenAI for revenue cycle.** 38% jump from 58% in 2023 to 80% in 2025 exploring/piloting/implementing gen AI for RCM. Market timing validates RCM-AI thesis. (Web: HFMA survey)
- [ ] **First RCM rollup reaches $100M+ ARR.** Would prove scalability of M&A-as-distribution model.

## Bear Case

- [x] **Voice AI commoditization is real—67% would switch.** "Customers view scribing as becoming commoditized, and current switching costs are low." Among outpatient providers, likelihood to switch rises to 67%. Stickiness appears weak without platform expansion. (Web: Menlo Ventures 2025)

- [x] **Epic native AI threatens standalone market.** Epic releasing native AI scribe in partnership with Microsoft (early 2026). Rumored $80/provider/month vs. startup $600/month. Abridge VP Sales: "Abridge is about to get run over... Epic is releasing their own scribing capability... they're screwed." ([[abridge-fathom-ab7cd03e]])

- [x] **ZocDoc already has distribution moat.** "Built on nearly two decades of scheduling experience." 70% auto-resolution at $2/booked appointment. Embedded in Google, insurance directories, provider sites. ([[2025-12-23-horizontal-vs-vertical-ai-healthcare]])

- [x] **Horizontal players capture admin layer.** Sierra at $10B valuation, $100M ARR in 21 months—targeting scheduling/billing/eligibility. Could bundle voice AI as feature. BUT: Use cases remain administrative, not clinical. (Web: Sierra)

- [x] **AI quality CAN win: startups captured 70% of new ambient market.** Despite Nuance's 77% hospital penetration, startups like Abridge (30% share) and Ambience (13%) captured 70% of NEW market with superior performance. Quality matters for initial adoption. (Web: Menlo Ventures 2025)

- [ ] **AI commoditizes faster than distribution compounds.** If voice AI becomes truly plug-and-play, distribution advantage erodes. Healthcare integration complexity suggests unlikely near-term.

- [ ] **Large health systems build internally.** If major systems decide to build rather than buy, distribution partnerships become less valuable.

## The Counter Thesis

**The counter-thesis:** Distribution advantages are temporary in a commoditizing market.

If voice AI becomes a $80/month commodity bundled into Epic (launching early 2026), then standalone players with "distribution moats" find those moats worthless—Epic IS the ultimate distribution channel with 42% of US hospitals. The evidence shows 85% of AI spend currently flows to startups, but "customers prefer to buy AI from their incumbent EHR" for everything except ambient scribes and chart review. Once Epic bundles, customer preference + distribution = game over for point solutions.

The same logic applies to horizontal platforms. Sierra achieved $100M ARR in 21 months targeting healthcare admin (scheduling, billing, eligibility). If Sierra expands to voice AI and bundles it with their broader admin suite, specialty-specific distribution becomes less valuable—they have cross-industry distribution + healthcare presence.

What would need to be true for this counter-thesis to win:
1. Epic's native AI scribe works "good enough" (not necessarily best) at scale
2. Switching costs remain low despite integration claims
3. Clinical complexity doesn't require specialty-specific training data

The evidence cuts both ways: startups captured 70% of new ambient market DESPITE Nuance incumbency (suggesting quality wins), but 67% of outpatient providers would switch (suggesting low lock-in). The thesis bet is that integration expertise compounds faster than AI quality commoditizes—that by the time Epic bundles, distribution-strong players have expanded to platforms too valuable to rip out.

## Timeline

**Now → 2026:**
- Voice AI adoption accelerates in dental, ortho, primary care
- Epic native AI scribe launches early 2026—watch adoption rates and customer defections
- Referral automation (Tennr) expands to new verticals beyond radiology
- Watch for: Abridge/Ambience expansion beyond documentation (prior auth, coding, revenue cycle)
- Entry point: Underserved EHR ecosystems (MEDITECH, athena, NextGen) before Epic bundle hits

**2027 → 2028:**
- Market consolidates to 2-3 dominant players per EHR ecosystem
- Fax elimination reaches tipping point in referrals
- Critical threshold: Distribution-strong players ($100M+ ARR) vs. point-solution collapse
- Horizontal players either win admin bundle or retreat from voice
- RCM rollup platforms emerge with $500M+ in acquired revenue

**2029+:**
- Voice AI becomes infrastructure layer, not standalone product
- Winners either acquired by EHR vendors or become embedded platform partners
- Referral/fax automation fully automated for majority of practices
- Value shifts to next frontier (prior auth decision support, clinical intelligence)
- Market structure solidifies: EHR-native for simple cases, vertical specialists for complex

---

## Startup Opportunities

**1. Platform Expansion Before Commoditization**
- Why this follows: Point solutions face $80/month Epic bundles. Survival requires platform expansion.
- Wedge: Start with high-retention wedge (documentation, referrals) then expand to prior auth, coding, revenue integrity.
- Risk: Expansion dilutes focus; Epic bundles faster than platform matures.

**2. EHR-Embedded Partnership in Underserved Ecosystems**
- Why this follows: Epic ecosystem crowded; athena, MEDITECH, NextGen underserved.
- Wedge: Deep partnership with non-Epic EHR vendor; become default AI layer for that ecosystem.
- Risk: Smaller TAM per ecosystem; may need multiple partnerships to reach scale.

**3. Specialty-Specific Voice + Referral Bundle**
- Why this follows: Referrals have "no real competitors." Specialty verticals (radiology, DME, ortho) have unique workflows. SimonMed CIO: "radiology is extremely complicated compared to medicine."
- Wedge: Bundle voice AI + referral automation for specific specialty. Own the front-end workflow end-to-end.
- Risk: Tennr expanding into verticals; specialty TAM may be too small for venture scale.

**4. RCM Rollup Platform (PE-Backed)**
- Why this follows: M&A creates distribution faster than enterprise sales in fragmented market.
- Wedge: Acquire at 3-7x EBITDA services multiples, transform to 80% GM AI-native operations.
- Risk: Integration complexity post-M&A; AI transformation harder than projected.

---

## Watch For

**If RIGHT (thesis plays out):**
- Assort or similar wins deals explicitly citing EHR/vendor relationship (not AI quality)
- Tennr maintains "no real competitors" position through 2027
- Voice AI startups announce EHR vendor partnerships as primary GTM
- Abridge/Ambience expand to platform (prior auth, coding) before Epic bundle kills standalone
- Horizontal players (Sierra) struggle to penetrate healthcare voice despite admin success
- M&A: EHR vendor or practice management company acquires voice AI startup at premium
- First RCM rollup reaches $100M+ ARR with 60%+ gross margin

**If WRONG (thesis fails):**
- AI quality differentiation emerges (clear winner on conversational ability wins direct deals)
- Sierra or Reducto captures healthcare voice AI as bundle feature
- Epic bundles native voice AI AND adoption exceeds 50% within 18 months
- New entrant wins significant share without distribution partnerships (proves direct sales works)
- Voice AI commoditizes to point where switching is frictionless (sub-30-day implementations)
- RCM rollups fail to achieve margin transformation (stuck at 20-30% GM)

*Confidence: HIGH — 25+ operator sources across voice AI and RCM rollups confirm distribution > AI quality mechanism. MEDIUM-HIGH on point-solution survivability given Epic threat.*
*Last rebuilt: 2026-01-07*
*Contrarian threats: Epic native AI bundling (HIGH threat—$80/month vs $600/month), voice AI commoditization with 67% switch likelihood (MEDIUM-HIGH), horizontal platforms like Sierra (MEDIUM). Thesis mechanism CONFIRMED but platform expansion is now survival requirement, not optional.*
