# Thesis: Radiology IT Is Last On-Prem Bastion—Cloud Unification Wins

## Investment Take

Radiology is the last major healthcare IT market stuck on fragmented, on-prem software—and regulatory shifts just unlocked cloud unification. $110B US radiology market, 600M annual exams, >80% of all healthcare data by volume ([[sirona-97c97c5a]]). The opportunity: replace PACS, RIS, viewer, reporter with unified cloud SaaS.

Sirona is making the move. Founded from Stanford AIMI, raised $23M stealth, now raising $40M Series B. Pricing: $1-4+/exam across tiers. Already live with 5 of top 50 private practice radiology groups, 2% of US radiologists on platform, $12-20M ARR potential from current pipeline.

**Why now:** In 2020-2021, FDA downgraded radiology IT to Class I exempt status—viewers, PACS archive, even AI. First time a unified cloud platform is possible without 510(k) burden. Sirona claims "first FDA exempt AI ever."

The defensibility is data: unified usage data across the diagnostic workflow enables novel "intelligence amplification" features. Four pillars: distribution (last-mile solved), data rights (contractual), regulatory (exempt), defensibility (proprietary data flywheel).

**How this evolved:**
- *2025-12-21:* Single high-signal source (Sirona Series B deck). $110B market, regulatory shift, clear thesis.

## Bull Case

- [x] **Regulatory barrier removed.** FDA Class I exempt for viewers, PACS, AI. No 510(k) needed.
  - *Evidence:* [[sirona-97c97c5a]] — "First FDA exempt AI ever"

- [ ] **Unification beats fragmentation.** Standardized DICOM in, HL7 out. Easier to replace whole stack than piece-by-piece.
  - *Evidence:* [[sirona-97c97c5a]] — "Easier to replace workflow in whole than in part"

- [ ] **Data flywheel compounds.** Unified usage data enables AI features incumbents can't match.
  - *Evidence:* [[sirona-97c97c5a]] — Four pillars framework

## Bear Case

- [ ] **Incumbent inertia.** Nuance, Philips, AGFA have installed base. Migration is painful.
  - *Evidence:* [[sirona-97c97c5a]] — "On-prem inertia" listed as competitor weakness

- [ ] **MSFT/Nuance fights back.** $19.7B acquisition gives resources. Could build cloud platform.
  - *Evidence:* [[sirona-97c97c5a]] — Microsoft/Nuance deal referenced

- [ ] **Single customer concentration.** 5 practices = $12-20M ARR. What happens if one churns?
  - *Evidence:* Needs monitoring — Track customer retention

## Startup Opportunities

**1. Unified Radiology Cloud (Sirona model)**
- Replace PACS + RIS + viewer + reporter with single SaaS
- Why this follows: Regulatory shift enables, market is $110B
- Wedge: Private practices first, then health systems
- Risk: Incumbent response, long sales cycles

**2. Radiology AI Distribution**
- Platform for distributing 3rd party AI models through unified workflow
- Why this follows: Sirona's "RadOS" platform enables 3rd party AI add-ons
- Wedge: AI developers need distribution, radiologists need single interface
- Risk: Winner in workflow owns AI distribution

**3. Radiology Data Marketplace**
- Monetize de-identified radiology data for AI training
- Why this follows: >80% of healthcare data, unified data rights
- Wedge: Contractual data rights from platform adoption
- Risk: Privacy concerns, regulatory uncertainty

## Open Questions

**Is private practice the right wedge?**
→ OPEN: 50% of radiology is private practice. But health systems are bigger contracts. Track Sirona's expansion path.

**Will incumbents respond?**
→ OPEN: Philips, AGFA, Nuance could build cloud. Track their product roadmaps.

**Is $40M enough?**
→ OPEN: Enterprise radiology sales are long. Series B may need to last 3+ years.
