# Thesis: PBM & Pharmacy Economics

**Type:** Market Segment (Who buys? What are the economics?)

## The Take

The Big 3 PBMs have extracted ~$50B annually through opacity. That's ending. Transparency regulations will expose spread pricing and rebate retention at the NDC level. Pass-through PBMs capture 15-20% market share by 2028. This isn't a collapse—PBMs won't disappear—but $15-25B in margin is at risk.

**How this evolved:** Started as "PBMs are evil" take. Refined to: opacity is structural vulnerability, not moral failing. The unlock is transparency data making audits possible. Added CMS RFI (May 2025) as major catalyst—enforcement is imminent, not theoretical.

**Market size:** $500B total Rx spend. $50B in PBM admin/spread revenue at risk. $5-10B transparency infrastructure opportunity.

## Maturity: Established

## How The Market Works

**The opacity model:**
```
MANUFACTURER → PBM → PLAN SPONSOR → PATIENT
                 ↓
           Hidden profit levers:
           - Spread pricing: charge plan $100, pay pharmacy $60, keep $40
           - Rebate retention: manufacturer pays 30%, PBM passes 15%, keeps 15%
           - Admin fees buried in 300+ page contracts
           - Affiliated pharmacy steering (CVS → CVS Pharmacy)
```

Big 3 (CVS Caremark, Express Scripts, OptumRx) control ~80% of market. Specialty pharmacy is 50% of drug spend in <2% of prescriptions—that's where the money is.

**Why opacity worked:** Data asymmetry. Employers couldn't see what PBMs paid pharmacies. Contracts deliberately opaque. Even when employers suspected overcharging, they couldn't prove it.

**Market concentration breakdown (2024):**
- CVS Caremark: 21.3% market share
- OptumRx (UnitedHealth): 20.8% market share
- Express Scripts (Cigna): 17.1% market share (grew to top spot with Centene contract—20M lives, 118M total)
- Prime Therapeutics (Blues plans): 10.3% market share
- Big 3 combined: ~80% of 275M Americans, $600B market

**Vertical integration dynamics:** Five of six largest PBMs owned by insurers. CVS owns Aetna + CVS Pharmacy + Caremark. Cigna owns Express Scripts. UnitedHealth owns UnitedHealthcare + OptumRx. Creates compounding conflicts of interest—PBM steers to affiliated pharmacy, insurer benefits from higher drug costs (premium justification), retail pharmacy captures margin.

## Why This Matters Now

1. **CMS enforcement is imminent.** Prescription drug MRF deferred since 2021. Executive Order 14221 (Feb 2025) directs HHS to enforce within 90 days. May 2025 RFI signals implementation timeline.

2. **Employer frustration peaked.** Self-insured employers seeing 8-10% annual trend increases. Stop-loss pressure acute. Benefits consultants recommending PBM audits. 61% of 324 employers surveyed moved away from Big 3 or considering it within 3 years (Sept 2025 National Alliance survey).
   - **Update:** Cigna faced surprising surge in employer plan claims late 2024, expects continuation into 2025. Q1 2025: $63M net income on $3.7B revenue vs $532M on $4.1B Q1 2024. Covered lives dropped from 19M to 18M.

3. **Pass-through models proven.** SmithRx, Capital Rx, Rightway demonstrated you can run a PBM on fixed admin fees. They're growing. Big 3 can't ignore them. Challenger PBMs now serve 1M+ lives, responding to 700+ RFPs/year, delivering 16-30% cost reductions.

4. **GLP-1 crisis accelerating employer action—and revealing fundamental PBM dysfunction.** HCA Healthcare dropped Wegovy/Zepbound coverage after 90% surge in GLP-1 use. Directing employees to manufacturer discount programs ($200-450/month cash) instead. The dysfunction: employers don't know actual net price through PBM rebate complexity, so they literally can't determine if $300 cash price is better than "negotiated" plan price. Quote from HCA: "In many cases, the discounts available through Lilly and Novo's programs make the medications less expensive than what group health plans can negotiate." Translation: PBM opacity is so complete that employers suspect—but can't prove—they're overpaying. 1 in 10 Americans expected on GLP-1 by 2030; $100B+ market. This is the wedge that forces transparency.

5. **Hospital drug markup is parallel problem.** 40% of 1,700 hospitals charge insurers 5x+ what Medicare pays for generic cancer drugs. Example: Oxaliplatin costs Medicare $35, Rush charges $13,560 (350x+). Chemotherapy markups add ~$10/member/month. This isn't PBM-specific but shows broader opacity in drug economics that transparency data could expose.

6. **Legislative momentum building.** S. 526 (Pharmacy Benefit Manager Transparency Act of 2025) mandates public reporting of rebates, fees, spread pricing. Bans practices obscuring true drug costs. Executive Order (April 15, 2025) "Lowering Drug Prices by Once Again Putting Americans First" increases PBM fee transparency requirements for employer plans.

---

## The Bull Case

1. **Transparency data is free.** Once CMS enforces, anyone can access NDC-level pricing. $0 data acquisition cost for audit platforms. Employers get ammunition they never had.

2. **Bipartisan momentum.** FTC scrutiny intensifying. Both parties hate PBMs. Political cover for enforcement. S. 526 transparency bill, Executive Order (April 2025), state-level actions converging.

3. **Switching costs lower than perceived.** Pass-through PBMs have proven the transition works. First movers (large self-insured employers) will create case studies. 61% already moved or considering.

4. **Self-funded employer pain is acute.** 30-90 day stop-loss reimbursement delays standard; 6-9 months for complex claims (premature births, cell/gene therapies, transplants). Adaptive capital solutions emerging to eliminate reimbursement lag. Real-time data analytics can identify high-risk claims before they become cost shocks. This creates demand for transparency tools.

5. **Benefits consultant alignment.** 60% influence PBM decisions. 15-20% savings on first contract review. Arming consultants with audit platforms accelerates switching. Revenue share model aligns incentives.

6. **Employer self-funded trend.** More employers moving to self-funded plans for control and transparency. Self-funded = direct exposure to PBM costs, higher incentive to audit.

7. **Specialty drug pipeline forces action.** 30-40 specialty launches by 2028. Zasocitinib + oral alternatives to injectables. Specialty = 50% of spend in <2% scripts. Opacity highest-stakes in specialty. Can't afford to be blind on $100B+ GLP-1 market.

8. **PBM market growth.** $602.95B (2024) → $950.67B (2033), 4.77% CAGR. Rising costs increase employer pain, expand TAM for transparency solutions.

---

## The Bear Case

1. **Regulatory capture.** PBMs have lobbyists. Already deferred 4 years. Could water down requirements or delay indefinitely. S. 526 not yet law.

2. **Employer inertia.** Transparency data useless if nobody acts. HR teams overwhelmed. Switching is painful. Inertia might beat frustration. 61% "considering" doesn't mean 61% will switch.

3. **Big 3 pivot—and they're not standing still.** CVS launching "Zinc" (transparent offering). Express Scripts has "Ascent." More telling: CVS Health Ventures led Codoxo's $35M Series C (Dec 2025) for AI-powered payment integrity covering 80M+ lives. Their "Point Zero" approach catches payment errors before claims are even submitted. Big 3 isn't just rebranding—they're building (or buying) the capabilities to thrive in a transparent world. If they can combine scale with better analytics, startups lose their window.

4. **Specialty drug pipeline accelerates urgency.** Takeda's zasocitinib (oral TYK2 inhibitor) just hit Phase 3 endpoints for plaque psoriasis: >50% achieved PASI 90 (clear/almost clear skin), ~30% achieved PASI 100 (completely clear) at week 16. Also in trials for psoriatic arthritis, Crohn's, ulcerative colitis. This is one of 30-40 specialty drug launches by 2028. Pattern: oral alternatives to injectables, multiple indications, high efficacy. Each launch = new steering opportunity for whoever controls pharmacy benefits. PBM transparency matters MOST in specialty because that's where the margin is (50% of drug spend in <2% of prescriptions). As specialty pipeline explodes, opacity becomes higher-stakes game.

5. **Scale still matters.** Big 3 can negotiate better rebates due to volume. Challenger PBMs limited by network power. Employers may prefer transparent Big 3 offering over unproven challenger.

6. **Benefits consultant conflicts.** Some consultants profit from rebate guarantees (NPC research). Incentives misaligned. Transparency threatens consultant revenue models. Not all will push switching.

7. **Vertical integration moats.** CVS (Aetna + Caremark + Pharmacy), UnitedHealth (Insurance + OptumRx + Optum Health). Data integration across stack creates lock-in. Hard to replicate without vertical integration.

8. **Complexity favors incumbents.** Specialty drug management, utilization management, prior authorization require sophistication. Challengers less developed. Employers may not trust them with complex therapies.

- Benefits consultant RFP (consultant turnover creates opening)
- Financial distress (cost reduction mandate)

**Claim Events (Trigger Analysis):**
- GLP-1 surge (90%+ utilization increase)
- Specialty drug launch requiring coverage decision
- Stop-loss claim exceeding threshold (focus on cost drivers)
- Audit finding (external consultant identifies overpayment)

### Competitive Positioning

**Against Big 3 PBMs:**
- Message: "They profit from opacity. We profit from transparency."
- Proof: Compare spread pricing (their model) to pass-through (our platform enables)
- Tactic: Use their own financial reports to show margin compression risk

**Against Challenger PBMs (if offering platform, not PBM services):**
- Message: "We're independent. We help you choose and monitor any PBM."
- Proof: No PBM clients, employer-only customer base
- Tactic: Position as fiduciary standard (like RIA vs broker in wealth management)

**Against Incumbent Audit Platforms (Truveris, Codoxo):**
- Message: "Free MRF data changed the game. Old platforms charge for what's now public."
- Proof: $0 data acquisition cost, software-only margin structure
- Tactic: Attack their PBM client conflicts (Codoxo funded by CVS)

**Against Benefits Consultants (if direct-to-employer):**
- Message: "Software-driven analysis at 1/10th the cost."
- Proof: Automated audit vs consultant-hours, % of savings vs hourly fees
- Tactic: Partner rather than compete—offer white-label to consultants

**Against Doing Nothing (Inertia):**
- Message: "You're overpaying 15-20%. Prove us wrong."
- Proof: Free audit, no-risk analysis
- Tactic: Quantify cost of inaction ($ lost per month delay)

- Specialty management: Additional $2-5 PMPM
- Value-added services: $1-3 PMPM (navigation, adherence)

Key Metrics:
- Lives per employer: 500-5,000 (mid-market to enterprise)
- Revenue per member per year: $48-144 (at $4-12 PMPM)
- Annual revenue at 2M lives: $96-288M
- CAC: $50-150 per life (consultant-driven), 12-18 month payback
- Churn: <10% annually (3-5 year contracts)
- NRR: 110-120% (lives + PMPM expansion)

Path to $1B valuation:
- 2M lives × $6 PMPM × 12 months = $144M ARR
- At 10-12x (PBM multiples), need 1.5-2M lives at scale PMPM
- Achievable in 7-10 years with 15-20% market share goal
```

### Scenario 3: Vertical Integration Play (CVS Counter-Positioning)

```
Target: $200M+ ARR at 8-12x = $1.6-2.4B valuation
Timeline: 8-12 years
Model: Build transparent PBM + specialty pharmacy + member tools

Stage           Component                   Revenue Stream              Margin
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Phase 1         Transparent PBM             Admin fees                  60%
(Yr 1-3)        1M lives                    $50-100M ARR

Phase 2         Specialty pharmacy          Dispensing + services       50%
(Yr 3-5)        Carve-out from PBM          $30-60M ARR

Phase 3         Member navigation           SaaS + engagement fees      70%
(Yr 5-7)        Overlay on PBM              $20-40M ARR

Phase 4         Data/analytics platform     Insights, benchmarking      80%
(Yr 7-10)       Sell to consultants/payers  $30-50M ARR

Total ARR at Year 10: $130-250M
Blended gross margin: 60-65%

Moat: Vertical integration without opacity conflicts
- Own specialty pharmacy (capture high-margin without steering games)
- Member tools drive adherence (outcomes-based contracting)
- Data platform creates switching costs (consultant dependency)

Comps: Navitus (8.7M lives, SSM + Costco owned, specialty via Lumicera)
```

## Open Questions

### Will CMS actually enforce prescription drug MRF within 12-18 months?

**Priority:** P0 (investment-blocking)

**Investment Gate:** If CMS defers again or waters down requirements, transparency data remains locked. Audit platforms can't scale, employer switching slows. Entire thesis depends on NDC-level pricing becoming public.

**What Would Change My Mind:**
- If CMS publishes enforcement rules with <90 day compliance timeline → Full investment justified. Audit platforms become immediate opportunity.
- If CMS defers again or allows "aggregated" pricing (not NDC-level) → Bear case. Focus on pass-through PBMs, not audit platforms. Big 3 wins another cycle.
- If enforcement happens but data quality is poor (missing NDCs, stale pricing) → Partial opportunity. Platforms need data cleaning layer, delays scale.

**How to Find Out:**
- Monitor Federal Register for final rules (post-May 2025 RFI)
- Interview HHS/CMS officials on enforcement timeline (via benefits trade groups)
- Track Executive Order 14221 90-day deadline compliance
- Survey early MRF filers (if any) on data format, completeness
- Engage benefits consultants on whether current MRF data (if available) is actionable

### Can challenger PBMs scale to 15-20% market share, or will Big 3 retain dominance?

**Priority:** P0 (investment-blocking for PBM opportunity, thesis-changing for platform opportunity) — **PROGRESS (Dec 2025)**

**Investment Gate:** If challengers plateau at 5-10% share, pass-through PBM opportunity is niche. If they reach 15-20%, market validates transparent model and platform opportunity expands (more PBMs to enable).

**Dec 2025 Research Findings:**
- **Big 3 still dominate:** ~80% market share (Express Scripts, OptumRx, CVS Caremark)
- **Challenger share:** ~20% combined (up from ~15% in 2024)
- **Navitus:** 18M lives across 800 clients; launching NavitusClear with Costco Cost Plus (Jan 2026)
- **Rightway:** 100% rebate pass-through; ~16% pharmacy spend reduction Y1; won Tyson Foods from Caremark
- **Cost Plus Drugs:** 1M+ customers, ~10% weekly growth; won Blue Shield CA (4.8M members), Select Health (1M members)
- **Employer sentiment:** 61% have moved or considering moving from Big 3 in next 3 years; 52% considering PBM change; 12% already using transparent PBM
- **Big 3 response:** Express Scripts launched ClearCareRx (100% pass-through); CVS TrueCost (75% adoption by late 2024); OptumRx Cost Clarity

**Status: PROGRESS** — Challengers gaining traction faster than expected. Navitus at 18M lives validates scale is achievable. Employer switching intent (61%) exceeds actual switching (12%), suggesting friction remains but momentum building. Big 3 defensive moves (pass-through offerings) validate threat but may satisfy some switching demand.

**What Would Change My Mind:**
- If SmithRx/Capital Rx/Rightway grow to 3M+ lives each by 2027 → Market validates pass-through model. Invest in PBM or enabling platforms.
- If challengers stall at <1M lives despite regulatory tailwinds → Employer inertia/Big 3 moats too strong. Focus on Big 3-adjacent opportunities (e.g., audit platforms they'll acquire).
- If Big 3 "transparent" offerings (Zinc, Ascent, ClearCareRx) capture switching employers → Incumbents successfully pivot. Startups lose window. Pivot to differentiation (specialty, mid-market).

**How to Find Out:**
- Track SmithRx, Capital Rx, Rightway press releases on lives under management
- Monitor National Alliance surveys on employer PBM switching rates (annual)
- Interview benefits consultants on RFP pipeline (what % going to challengers?)
- Analyze Big 3 earnings calls for commentary on transparent offering traction
- Survey employers who switched: satisfaction, renewal intent, actual savings

### What percentage of self-funded employers will actually act on transparency data?

**Priority:** P1 (thesis-changing)

**Investment Gate:** Transparency data is necessary but not sufficient. If <20% of employers act on audit findings, TAM shrinks dramatically. If >50% act, massive opportunity.

**What Would Change My Mind:**
- If early audit platforms (Truveris, Codoxo) show >50% conversion from audit to switching → Strong demand signal. Employer frustration overcomes inertia.
- If conversion is <20% despite compelling savings (15-20%) → Inertia dominates. Focus on automated/no-touch solutions, or mandated transparency (gov/regulatory).
- If large employers act (>1000 employees) but mid-market doesn't → Segment opportunity. Build for enterprise, not SMB.

**How to Find Out:**
- Partner with benefits consultant to pilot audits, track conversion rates
- Analyze Truveris/Codoxo customer case studies for switching rates (if disclosed)
- Survey employers post-audit: what % switched PBMs? What blocked non-switchers?
- Interview HR leaders: what would trigger PBM switch? (Contract renewal? Board mandate? Savings threshold?)
- Track benefits consultant RFP volume for PBM services (leading indicator)

### Are benefits consultants aligned or conflicted on transparency?

**Priority:** P1 (thesis-changing for GTM strategy)

**Investment Gate:** 60% of employers say consultants influence PBM selection. If consultants push transparency, they're a distribution channel (bull case). If they're conflicted (profit from rebate guarantees), they're a barrier (bear case).

**What Would Change My Mind:**
- If top 20 consultants (Mercer, Segal, Aon, WTW) publicly endorse transparency and partner with audit platforms → Clear alignment. GTM via consultant channel works.
- If consultants resist transparency (revenue at risk from rebate arrangements) → Conflict dominates. Go direct to employers, position consultants as part of the problem.
- If split (some aligned, some conflicted) → Segment strategy. Partner with aligned consultants, educate employers to pressure conflicted ones.

**How to Find Out:**
- Interview 10+ benefits consultants on revenue model (how paid? rebate-linked?)
- Survey employers: do consultants recommend transparency? Or status quo?
- Analyze NPC research on consultant incentives (which firms perpetuate rebate guarantees?)
- Attend benefits conferences: what are consultants saying publicly? (Business Group on Health, NBGH)
- Track consultant RFPs: are they including "transparency" as evaluation criteria?

### Will Big 3 transparent offerings (Zinc, Ascent) satisfy employer demand, or is structural conflict unsolvable?

**Priority:** P2 (opportunity-defining)

**Investment Gate:** If Big 3 can credibly offer transparency while maintaining vertical integration, they win (scale + transparency). If structural conflict prevents true transparency, challengers have opening.

**What Would Change My Mind:**
- If Zinc/Ascent contracts show full NDC-level pass-through + fiduciary standard → Big 3 successfully pivoted. Startup window closing. Focus on differentiation (specialty, mid-market, better UX).
- If "transparent" offerings still have opacity (aggregate rebates, vague admin fees) → Greenwashing. Employers see through it. Challengers/platforms have 3-5 year window.
- If employers don't care (accept Big 3 "transparency" without audit) → Market not sophisticated. Opportunity limited to top 10% of employers.

**How to Find Out:**
- Obtain Zinc/Ascent contracts, compare to SmithRx/Capital Rx (NDC-level pricing? 100% pass-through?)
- Interview employers using Big 3 "transparent" offerings: are you actually seeing savings?
- Audit platform test: run analysis on Zinc/Ascent—do they price better than traditional Big 3?
- Track market share: are Zinc/Ascent winning back switching employers, or losing to challengers?
- Analyze CVS/Cigna/UHG earnings: are they reporting margin compression from transparent offerings? (If yes, it's real. If no, it's rebranding.)

### Does specialty drug complexity create a moat for Big 3, or an opportunity for carve-outs?

**Priority:** P2 (opportunity-defining)

**Investment Gate:** Specialty = 50% of spend in <2% of scripts. If complexity (prior auth, utilization management, patient support) requires Big 3 scale, it's a moat. If employers can carve out specialty to transparent providers (Navitus/Lumicera, Waltz), it's the highest-value opportunity.

**What Would Change My Mind:**
- If specialty carve-outs (Lumicera, Waltz+WellDyne) show >25% savings without access issues → Complexity is solvable. Massive opportunity (50% of spend).
- If carve-outs create access/quality problems (prior auth delays, patient complaints) → Complexity is real moat. Focus on non-specialty transparency.
- If GLP-1 crisis forces employer action (can't compare PBM price to D2C) → Wedge opportunity. Specialty transparency becomes P0 for employers.

**How to Find Out:**
- Interview employers using specialty carve-outs: savings? member satisfaction? operational burden?
- Analyze Navitus/Lumicera performance data (if disclosed): cost vs Big 3 specialty?
- Track Waltz+WellDyne partnership (May 2025): early traction? employer adoption?
- Survey specialty pharmacies: are transparent PBMs gaining share?
- Monitor manufacturer D2C programs (GLP-1, zasocitinib): are more going direct to bypass PBMs? (If yes, PBM disintermediation accelerating.)

### What happens to audit platforms if Big 3 acquires them (Codoxo → CVS signal)?

**Priority:** P2 (opportunity-defining for platform strategy)

**Investment Gate:** CVS leading Codoxo's $35M Series C suggests Big 3 may acquire audit capabilities to neutralize threat. If acquisitions common, platform opportunity is "get acquired" (not standalone $1B co). If employers reject Big 3-owned auditors (conflict of interest), independent platforms thrive.

**What Would Change My Mind:**
- If employers reject Codoxo post-CVS investment (conflict of interest too obvious) → Independent platforms win. "We're employer-only, no PBM clients" is strong positioning.
- If Codoxo thrives with CVS backing (employers don't care about conflict) → Audit platforms become features, not companies. Big 3 acquires best tech. Opportunity is "build to sell."
- If Big 3 acquires all major audit platforms → Create new independent platform with fiduciary standard (like RIA model in wealth management). Regulatory/legislative push for independence.

**How to Find Out:**
- Survey employers: would you use PBM audit platform owned by a PBM? (Conflict test)
- Track Codoxo customer mix post-CVS investment: gaining/losing employer customers?
- Interview Truveris on acquisition interest: are Big 3 trying to buy them?
- Monitor M&A: any other audit platform acquisitions by Big 3?
- Engage benefits trade groups on independence standard: should auditors be PBM-free? (Like fiduciary rule for advisors)
