## 1-2 Sentence Summary

**Healthcare AI vendors** win by owning operational workflows (referrals, documentation, billing) that generate compounding proprietary data, NOT by having superior AI models or traditional channel partnerships → **workflow gravity creates switching costs that commoditized AI cannot replicate, making the winners those who expand from wedge to platform before incumbents bundle.**

---

## Investment Take

**Today:** The question for healthcare AI in 3-5 years isn't "who has the best model?" or "who has the best channel partners?" It's **who owns the workflow data that compounds?**

AI model quality is converging—85% of healthcare AI spend flows to startups because they ship faster, but ambient documentation is already commoditizing (67% of outpatient providers would switch vendors). Channel partnerships matter, but 89% of sellers already use partners daily—it's table stakes, not differentiation. The actual commercial moat is **workflow depth**: companies that start with a wedge (documentation, referrals, voice) and expand across the value chain (coding, prior auth, revenue cycle) create switching costs that persist even as the underlying AI becomes commodity.

Three mechanisms explain why workflow ownership beats model quality:

**Mechanism 1: Compounding Data Loops.** Every patient interaction, every referral processed, every claim coded becomes training data. Tennr achieved "300-400% efficiency improvement" not because their AI is fundamentally better, but because they've processed millions of faxes across hundreds of payer-provider combinations. SimonMed's CIO notes: "no player outside the radiology space has taken the time to understand the radiology landscape and ecosystem." That understanding IS the data—accumulated through operational deployment, not model architecture.

**Mechanism 2: Integration Depth Creates Switching Costs.** SleepQuest's Tennr integration took 7 months vs. 3-month expectation because "they had to play with ECW and get them to agree to certain things." Pinnacle Group chose Tennr specifically because "they had a lot of experience API into Brightree... other guys said 'Yes, we can learn that'... It's really not something you learned." This integration expertise is earned through painful deployments—it's operational knowledge, not model parameters.

**Mechanism 3: Platform Expansion Before Commoditization.** Abridge expanded from documentation → revenue cycle intelligence → prior authorization → coding in 2025. Their $5.3B valuation reflects this expansion, not documentation quality (where Epic's Art will bundle at $80/month vs. Abridge's ~$600/month). The platform expansion IS the survival strategy: by the time Epic bundles documentation, Abridge owns too much of the workflow to rip out.

**MAJOR THREAT (from contrarian research):** Epic's native AI scribe launches early 2026 at rumored $80/provider/month. Combined with 67% willingness to switch among outpatient providers, this is existential for point solutions. The counter is platform expansion—Abridge raised $550M in 2025 specifically to escape the documentation kill zone.

**In 3-5 years:** The healthcare AI market bifurcates into two winning models.

The first winning model is **Vertical Operating System Players**—companies that started with a clinical wedge and expanded into operational gravity. Abridge (documentation → revenue cycle → prior auth), Tennr (referrals → scheduling → eligibility), and specialty-specific bundles (voice + referral + coding for radiology). These players own enough workflow touchpoints that switching costs compound: you don't just lose the AI, you lose the operational muscle memory embedded across your practice.

The second winning model is **M&A-Built Platforms**—PE-backed roll-ups that acquire RCM companies at services multiples (3-7x EBITDA) and transform to software economics (60-80% GM). Ease's thesis: "Rollup is the Means, Software is the Outcome." By acquiring operational businesses, you get captive distribution + workflow data + real training examples for AI automation. New Mountain Capital's "Smarter Technologies" (Access Healthcare + SmarterDx + Thoughtful.ai) is the template.

The losers are **Point Solution Pure-Plays**—companies that never expanded beyond their initial wedge before Epic/horizontal platforms bundle the feature. Also **Model-First Startups**—companies betting on AI quality differentiation without workflow ownership. And **Generic "AI for Healthcare"**—Olive AI's failure lesson: "claiming 'AI-powered automation' without true AI capabilities erodes trust." The market punishes vaporware.

Market structure: 2-3 vertical OS players per specialty (ambient/documentation, referrals, coding) + 3-5 PE-backed roll-up platforms with $100M+ ARR + EHR-native bundles for commodity features + horizontal infrastructure (Sierra, Reducto) for admin layer only.

**How this evolved:**
- *2025-12:* Multiple Tegus calls revealed pattern: AI found via referral, not evaluation. Integration expertise is the moat.
- *2025-12-29:* Split from "EHR Integration and Distribution Win Provider AI"
- *2026-01-04:* **REBUILD v1** — 17 sources on channel partnerships
- *2026-01-07:* **MERGED** RCM Rollups thesis
- *2026-01-09:* **REBUILD v3** — TITLE CHANGED from "Distribution Beats AI Quality in Healthcare—Channel Partners and M&A Win." Contrarian research revealed channel partners are table stakes (89% of sellers use them). Real mechanism: workflow data compounds while AI quality commoditizes. Threats: Epic bundling ($80/month), 67% switch willingness. Platform expansion is survival requirement.

## Bull Case

- [x] **Integration expertise is earned, not built.** Pinnacle Group: "We chose Tennr because they had a lot of experience API into Brightree... It's really not something you learned." SleepQuest integration took 7 months. This expertise compounds. ([[tennr-pinnacle-group-7764e76c]], [[tennr-sleepquest-b48eb7eb]])

- [x] **Workflow data creates compounding advantage.** Tennr: "300-400% efficiency improvement" from accumulated operational knowledge. SimonMed CIO: "No player outside radiology has taken the time to understand the radiology landscape." ([[tennr-mpowerhealth-936bbeef]], [[chief-innovation-officer-at-simonmed-imaging-_-tennr-_-tegus-224eecf0]])

- [x] **Platform expansion beats point solution pricing.** Abridge expanded from documentation → revenue cycle → prior auth in 2025, reaching $5.3B valuation. Platform value exceeds feature price compression. (Web: Abridge Series E, June 2025)

- [x] **M&A creates captive distribution faster than GTM.** Ease achieving 80% gross margin on AI-driven work vs 20% on traditional services. Acquire at 3-7x EBITDA, transform to software multiples. New Mountain Capital's "Smarter Technologies" rollup validates playbook. ([[ease_sept2025-a16z-rcm-roll-up-212465b1]], Web: Digital Health M&A 2025)

- [x] **Referral automation has "no real competitors."** MPOWERHealth: "We have not found any competitors to Tennr in the referral space." 9.5/10 rating. "No real competitors in referral space" despite simple underlying technology. ([[tennr-mpowerhealth-936bbeef]])

- [x] **Availability beats intelligence for voice AI.** Assort: 40%→4% abandonment proves value is 24/7 availability, not AI sophistication. Patients call 40-50 times/day just to confirm appointments after text confirmation. ([[Assort Health _ Interviews _ Tegus Company Profile]], [[chief-executive-officer-at-barrington-orthopedic-specialists-21d19bd0]])

- [x] **Healthcare buyers prioritize reliability over innovation.** "Healthcare buyers want reliability, auditability, and integration. This pushes value toward deep-vertical AI companies with proven clinical workflows." (Web: Healthcare AI Vertical Moats 2025)

- [ ] **First vertical OS reaches $500M+ ARR.** Would prove platform expansion thesis at scale.

---

## Bear Case

- [x] **67% of outpatient providers would switch vendors.** "Customers view scribing as becoming commoditized, and current switching costs are low." Workflow gravity thesis requires integration depth that many point solutions don't have. (Web: Menlo Ventures 2025)

- [x] **Epic native AI launches at $80/month.** Epic's Art launches early 2026, rumored at ~$80/provider/month vs. startup $600/month. Epic owns 42% of US hospitals. Bundling compresses margins even for expanded platforms. (Web: Epic UGM 2025)

- [x] **AI quality CAN win initial adoption—startups captured 70% of new ambient market.** Despite Nuance's 77% hospital penetration, startups like Abridge (30%) and Ambience (13%) won on product quality. Model quality matters for initial land. (Web: Menlo Ventures 2025)

- [x] **Olive AI failure shows execution beats everything.** Olive raised $850M, valued at $4B, but failed due to "fast-paced growth and lack of focus" + overpromising. Neither distribution nor quality saved them—execution did. (Web: Olive AI Failure Analysis)

- [ ] **PE-backed rollups fail to achieve margin transformation.** If RCM acquisitions stay at 10-20% GM instead of 60%+, the M&A thesis breaks.

- [ ] **Health systems build internally at scale.** If 2-3 major systems succeed with internal AI, third-party workflow ownership becomes less valuable.

## The Counter Thesis

**The counter-thesis:** Workflow ownership is a temporary advantage in a market where AI performance converges and incumbents can acquire workflow data through their distribution.

If Epic's native AI scribe works "good enough" AND they can observe workflow patterns across their 42% hospital install base AND they use that data to improve their bundled offerings, then startup workflow data moats erode. Epic sees every Abridge deployment that runs on their platform—the Workshop program gives them visibility into what works before building native.

Similarly, horizontal AI players like Sierra ($100M ARR in 21 months) could decide healthcare workflow depth is worth the regulatory investment. They already have admin-layer presence (scheduling, billing, eligibility). Moving up into clinical workflows requires compliance investment, but at $10B valuation, they can afford it.

What would need to be true for this counter-thesis to win:
1. Epic's native AI achieves "good enough" quality AND adoption exceeds 50% within 18 months
2. Horizontal players (Sierra, Reducto) successfully move into clinical workflows
3. Workflow data proves less defensible than expected—new entrants can match incumbent data within 12-18 months

The bull thesis bet is that workflow data compounds faster than incumbents can catch up—that by the time Epic bundles, Abridge owns prior auth AND coding AND revenue cycle, making the documentation feature a trojan horse for platform stickiness. The bear thesis bet is that Epic's distribution + data visibility + bundling economics overwhelm startup workflow depth.

## Timeline

**Now → 2026:**
- Epic Art launches early 2026—watch adoption rates and Abridge/Ambience customer retention
- Platform expansion race: who moves from documentation → coding → prior auth fastest?
- RCM rollup activity accelerates—107 deals in H1 2025, PE firms creating "AI-native + legacy" combinations
- Entry point: Specialty-specific vertical OS plays (radiology, DME, dental) before horizontal bundling

**2027 → 2028:**
- Market consolidates to 2-3 vertical OS leaders per specialty
- First vertical OS reaches $500M+ ARR, proving platform expansion thesis
- Critical threshold: Point solutions either expand to platform or get acquired/die
- EHR vendors decide: partner with vertical OS players or continue building native?
- M&A: EHR vendor or major health system acquires a leading vertical OS player at premium

**2029+:**
- AI documentation becomes infrastructure layer, bundled into EHR
- Winners are platforms that own clinical workflow, not administrative features
- Value shifts to next frontier (diagnostic decision support, treatment optimization)
- Market structure solidifies: EHR-native for commodity features, vertical specialists for clinical complexity

---

## Startup Opportunities

**1. Specialty-Specific Vertical OS (Radiology, DME, Ortho)**
- Why this follows: SimonMed CIO: "radiology is extremely complicated... billions of dollars left on table." 66% national conversion rate = massive capture opportunity. No one has built the radiology operating system.
- Wedge: Referral automation (like Tennr) for specific specialty, then expand to scheduling, eligibility, coding.
- Risk: Tennr expands into verticals; specialty TAM may be too small for venture scale without multi-specialty rollout.

**2. RCM Roll-Up Platform (PE-Backed)**
- Why this follows: M&A creates distribution faster than enterprise sales. Acquire at 3-7x EBITDA services multiples, transform to 60-80% GM software economics. Ease template is proven.
- Wedge: Target fragmented specialties (behavioral health, home health) with niche RCM + EHR needs.
- Risk: Integration complexity post-M&A; AI margin transformation harder than projected; PE fund dynamics misaligned with platform building.

**3. Workflow-First Prior Authorization**
- Why this follows: Cohere Health has 16M members, 88-90% auto-approval. But prior auth is the highest-friction workflow in healthcare. Whoever owns the prior auth decision owns the upstream clinical documentation requirements.
- Wedge: Deep payer integration (Cohere model) + clinical guideline intelligence. Land with prior auth, expand into coding and documentation.
- Risk: Payer sales cycles are brutal (12+ months). CMS regulation changes could mandate interoperability that reduces workflow lock-in.

## Watch For

**If RIGHT (thesis plays out):**
- Abridge retains >80% of customers post-Epic Art launch through platform expansion
- Tennr maintains "no real competitors" position and expands to $100M+ ARR
- First RCM rollup reaches $100M+ ARR with 60%+ gross margin transformation
- M&A: Major health system or EHR vendor acquires vertical OS player at >10x revenue
- Horizontal players (Sierra) struggle to penetrate clinical workflows despite admin success

**If WRONG (thesis fails):**
- Epic Art adoption exceeds 50% within 18 months of launch
- Abridge/Ambience lose >30% of customers to Epic native within 24 months
- Voice AI commoditizes to point where switching is frictionless (sub-30-day implementations)
- New entrant wins significant market share without workflow data advantage (proves model quality wins)
- Sierra or horizontal player successfully moves into clinical AI with >$50M healthcare revenue
