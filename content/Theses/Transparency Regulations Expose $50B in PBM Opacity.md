# Thesis: Transparency Regulations Expose $50B in PBM Opacity

## Investment Take

Big 3 PBMs (CVS Caremark, Express Scripts, OptumRx) control ~80% of market and extract ~$50B annually through opacity: spread pricing, rebate retention, affiliated pharmacy steering ([[The Big 3 PBMs Analysis]]). That's ending. CMS enforcement imminent—Executive Order 14221 (Feb 2025) directs HHS to enforce prescription drug MRF within 90 days.

61% of 324 employers have moved from Big 3 or are considering it within 3 years ([[Navitus SmithRx market share 2025]]). Pass-through PBMs (SmithRx, Capital Rx, Rightway) proven: 16-30% cost reductions, 1M+ lives, 700+ RFPs/year. This isn't PBM collapse—Big 3 won't disappear—but $15-25B in margin is at risk.

GLP-1 crisis exposes dysfunction: HCA dropped Wegovy/Zepbound, directing employees to manufacturer D2C ($200-450/month) because they literally cannot determine if cash price beats PBM "negotiated" price. Opacity so complete employers suspect overpaying but can't prove it. 1 in 10 Americans expected on GLP-1 by 2030; $100B+ market forces transparency.

**How this evolved:**
- *2025-12-17:* Started as "PBMs are evil." Refined: opacity is structural vulnerability, not moral failing.
- *2025-12-20:* Added GLP-1 D2C as forcing function—employers bypassing PBM complexity entirely.

## Bull Case

- [x] **Transparency data is free.** Once CMS enforces, anyone can access NDC-level pricing. $0 data acquisition cost for audit platforms.
  - *Evidence:* Prescription drug MRF enforcement per Executive Order 14221

- [x] **Employer exodus accelerating.** 61% moved or considering. Pass-through PBMs proving the transition works.
  - *Evidence:* [[Navitus SmithRx market share 2025]] — SmithRx, Capital Rx, Rightway at scale

- [ ] **GLP-1 crisis forces action.** HCA dropped coverage, directing to D2C. Employers can't compare PBM price to cash.
  - *Evidence:* [[Employers drop coverage for weight loss drugs]] — "In many cases, manufacturer discounts less expensive than negotiated plan price"

---

## Bear Case

- [ ] **Regulatory capture.** PBMs have lobbyists. Already deferred 4 years. Could water down requirements.
  - *Evidence:* S. 526 not yet law

- [ ] **Big 3 pivot.** CVS launched "Zinc," Express Scripts "Ascent." CVS Ventures led Codoxo $35M Series C.
  - *Evidence:* [[Codoxo Series C]] — Big 3 building/buying transparency capabilities

- [ ] **Employer inertia.** Transparency data useless if nobody acts. HR overwhelmed. Switching painful.
  - *Evidence:* Needs monitoring — track actual switching vs "considering"

## Startup Opportunities

**1. PBM Contract Audit Platform**
- Ingest contract + MRF data, identify every instance employer overpaid
- Why this follows: Free MRF data = $0 acquisition cost, pure software margin
- GTM: Sell to benefits consultants (60% influence PBM selection)
- Risk: Big 3 acquiring audit platforms (Codoxo → CVS signal)

**2. Specialty Pharmacy Transparency**
- Focus on 50% of spend in <2% of prescriptions
- Why this follows: GLP-1 crisis shows employers can't compare prices—specialty is highest stakes
- Wedge: Help employers carve out specialty from Big 3
- Risk: Complexity may require Big 3 scale

**3. Self-Funded Employer Pharmacy Benefits OS**
- Bypass PBM entirely: direct contracts with pharmacies + manufacturers
- Why this follows: Transparency data enables NADAC-based pricing negotiation
- Wedge: Start with employers already using reference-based pricing
- Risk: Requires scale to negotiate, complex operations

## Open Questions

**Will CMS actually enforce prescription drug MRF within 12-18 months?**
→ OPEN: If CMS defers again, thesis delayed another cycle. Track Federal Register for final rules post-May 2025 RFI.

**Can challenger PBMs scale to 15-20% market share?**
→ PROGRESS (Dec 2025): Challengers at ~20% combined. Navitus 18M lives. Rightway won Tyson Foods. Big 3 launching pass-through offerings (ClearCareRx, TrueCost).

**What % of employers will act on transparency data?**
→ OPEN: If <20% act despite compelling savings, TAM shrinks. Partner with consultant to pilot audits, track conversion.
