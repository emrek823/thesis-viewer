# Thesis: Healthcare Vertical Integration Moats

**Type:** Investment/Strategy (M&A/Integration)

**Scope:** This thesis covers M&A strategy and market structure plays (wholesaler MSO acquisitions, payer-provider integration, CVS breakup). For VBC operations (navigation → platform → risk), see [[Specialty-VBC-Dynamics]].

## The Take

Wholesalers spent $16B+ acquiring MSOs to control the prescribing decision point. This isn't about distribution anymore—it's about extracting rent from biosimilar manufacturers desperate for market share. The new margin structure is 3-5x traditional distribution. Software that enables this steering captures share of a restructuring $50B+ profit pool.

**How this evolved:** Started as "why are wholesalers buying practices?" Realized biosimilars changed everything. 10 Humira biosimilars competing = manufacturers pay for steering. Whoever controls prescribing extracts rent from ALL manufacturers. This is a market structure play, not a distribution play.

**Market size:** $50B+ in profit pools restructuring. OneOncology alone: $243M incremental annual profit from biosimilar steering on same patient volume.

## Maturity: Emerging

## How The Market Works

**Old model (dumb pipes):**
```
Manufacturer → Wholesaler → Hospital/Practice → Patient
                  ↓
            1.3% spread
            No formulary control
            ~$80/patient/month margin
```

**New model (market makers):**
```
Manufacturer → Wholesaler-owned MSO → Patient
                      ↓
                Controls prescribing
                Extracts manufacturer rebates
                ~$190-240/patient/month margin
```

**The math (OneOncology example):**
- 1,400 oncologists, 500,000 patients/year
- 30% on provider-administered biologics = 150,000 patients
- Old margin: $144M/year
- New margin: $387M/year
- **Delta: $243M incremental profit** from same volume

**The rebate economics:**

Biosimilar manufacturers face intense competition (10 Humira biosimilars, 30-40 launches by 2028). Steering payments have become critical for market access:

- PBM rebates: Adalimumab biosimilars could have saved $6B, but would reduce PBM profits by 84%
- Buy-and-bill incentives: Provider markups favor higher-priced reference products over biosimilars
- Steering value: Manufacturers pay significant rebates to whoever can deliver prescription volume
- MSO advantage: Control 1,000+ oncologists (OneOncology) or 2,550+ oncologists (US Oncology) = negotiating leverage

The perverse incentive: biosimilars promise system savings but threaten stakeholder revenue. Wholesaler MSOs solve this by capturing manufacturer payments to offset lower drug prices.

## Competitive Landscape

**Three Integration Models Competing:**

### 1. Wholesaler MSO Plays (Most Aggressive)

**McKesson - US Oncology Network**
- Acquired 2010 for $2.2B (1,300 oncologists at acquisition)
- Current scale: 2,550+ oncologists, 600+ sites, 31 states, 1.6M patients/year
- Tennessee expansion: Nashville Oncology Associates (2023), Tennessee Cancer Specialists (2024)
- Model: MSO circumvents corporate practice of medicine laws—physician owns practice, McKesson manages operations
- Valuation context: McKesson market cap $70.5B
- Revenue from vertical integration: 45% of US population lives within 20 miles of network practice

**McKesson - Core Ventures/FCS (In Progress)**
- Announced August 2024: $2.5B for 70% of Core Ventures (business services arm of Florida Cancer Specialists)
- Scale: 250+ physicians, 280 APPs, 100 Florida locations
- Regulatory status: Anti-monopoly groups petitioned FTC to block (September 2024)

**Cencora (formerly AmerisourceBergen) - OneOncology**
- Acquired June 2023 for $2.1B (joint venture with TPG, Cencora 35% ownership)
- Founded 2018, rapidly aggregated independent oncology practices
- Scale: 1,000 medical professionals, 350 practices
- Strategic advantage: TPG partnership provides capital for continued practice acquisitions
- Integration thesis: $243M incremental annual profit from biosimilar steering economics

**Cardinal Health - Integrated Oncology Network (ION)**
- Acquired December 2024 for $1.1B cash
- Scale: 100+ providers, 50+ locations, 10 states
- Integration: Joining Cardinal's Navista oncology practice alliance
- Focus: Advanced analytics, value-based care support for independent oncology practices

**Strategic rationale across all three:**
- Forward integration removes manufacturer disintermediation risk (can't sell direct to practices)
- Wholesalers control >90% of pharmaceutical wholesale market—now extending to prescribing point
- MSO structure navigates state laws prohibiting corporate practice of medicine
- Biosimilar launch wave (30-40 by 2028) creates escalating rebate opportunity

### 2. Payer-Provider Integrators (Mixed Results)

**UnitedHealth Group/Optum (Gold Standard)**
- Structure: Optum (health services) separate from UnitedHealthcare (insurance)
- Optum scale: 120M+ Americans under management, 28+ physician group acquisitions since 2011
- Investment: $33B+ in acquisitions 2011-2020, $30B+ disclosed 2020-2023
- Performance: UHG stock +1,676% since Optum focus (24.8% CAGR), significantly outperforming peers
- Profit migration: Optum now majority of operating margin (uncapped service revenue vs. capped insurance MLR)
- Intercompany eliminations: Transfer profits from regulated insurance to unregulated services
- Recent activity: Amedisys acquisition ($3.3B) pending, DOJ challenging on antitrust grounds
- 2024 acquisition: Holston Medical Group (200+ providers, 70+ locations, Tennessee/Virginia)
- Flywheel: 60% of Optum Rx revenues from UHG affiliates, internal referral network drives growth

**CVS Health (Struggling)**
- Acquisitions: Aetna (payer), Oak Street Health (primary care), Signify Health (home health)
- Total investment: $88B+ over six years for vertical stack
- Performance: Considering breakup (WSJ October 2024)—synergies proving illusory
- Lesson: Largest player can't make full vertical integration work operationally
- Intercompany revenue: $53B of $263B pharmacy/PBM revenue from internal transactions (2024)
- Bear case evidence: If CVS breaks up after $88B investment, integration thesis broken

**Elevance Health (Selective Expansion)**
- 2024 acquisitions: Kroger Specialty Pharmacy, Paragon Health (ambulatory infusion)
- Strategy: Specialty care focus vs. full primary care build
- Indiana University health plan acquisition pending (expected close end 2024)
- Positioning: Targeted capabilities vs. comprehensive vertical integration

**Cigna (Retreating)**
- Selling Medicare business to Health Care Service Corp. for $3.3B (expected Q1 2025 close)
- Signal: Major payer divesting rather than integrating further

**Health Systems Divesting Plans (Counter-Trend):**
- Baystate Health → Point32Health: Health New England for $165M
- ProMedica → Medical Mutual of Ohio: Paramount Health (May 2024)
- Trend: Regional health systems exiting insurance, refocusing on care delivery

### 3. Integrated Delivery Systems (Steady State)

**Kaiser Permanente (Mature Model)**
- Scale: 12.5M members, 24,605 physicians, 40 hospitals, 614 medical offices
- Structure: Fully integrated (payer + provider owned, not acquired piecemeal)
- Financial performance: $329M operating income on $100.8B revenue (0.3% margin, 2023)
  - 2025 Q2 improvement: 3.2% operating margin, $3.3B net income
- Challenge: Narrow margins despite integration (not-for-profit, high-cost markets)
- Expansion: Risant Health (2023) with Geisinger as inaugural member
  - Geisinger: $6.9B revenue, 600k+ managed care members, 10 hospitals, 1,700 physicians
- Moat: Platform approach—all assets rise/fall together vs. diversification bet

**Market Structure:**
- Kaiser represents "build" vs. wholesaler/payer "buy" approach
- 45-year operating history validates model sustainability
- Limited geographic expansion demonstrates difficulty of replication

## Why This Matters Now

1. **Consolidation complete.** Big 3 have made their MSO acquisitions. OneOncology, US Oncology Network, Tennessee Oncology now under wholesaler control. Concentrated prescribing power exists.

2. **Biosimilar wave hitting.** 30-40 launches by 2028. Manufacturers desperate for share. Rebates available to whoever steers.

3. **Transparency enables targeting.** Can now identify exactly which switches are margin-positive for which practices.

4. **Regulatory scrutiny accelerating.** FTC challenging UHG-Amedisys, anti-monopoly groups petitioning against McKesson-Core Ventures and Cardinal-ION. 2024-2025 = decision point on whether integration continues.

5. **Profit migration validated.** Optum demonstrates model works: +1,676% stock performance, majority of UHG operating margin. Intercompany eliminations shift profits from capped insurance to uncapped services.

6. **CVS breakup signal.** $88B invested, now considering dismantling. If largest player fails, highlights integration difficulty—winner-take-most dynamics favoring Optum.

---

## The Bull Case

1. **Structural advantage locked in.** MSO acquisitions done. Wholesalers control decision point. Competitors can't replicate overnight.

2. **Manufacturer desperation compounds.** More biosimilars = more competition = higher rebates for steering. Margin grows as market fragments.

3. **Software multiplies leverage.** Conversion intelligence at scale across MSO network creates systematic steering. Data flywheel from outcomes registry.

4. **Optum proof point.** +1,676% stock return, $30B+ deployed profitably, profit migration to uncapped services working. Playbook exists and scales.

5. **Regulatory capture possible.** Despite scrutiny, major deals still completing (Cardinal-ION closed December 2024). Industry may be too consolidated to unwind.

6. **Value-based care alignment coming.** Two-sided risk models align provider incentives with biosimilar adoption—eliminates buy-and-bill perverse incentive. Wholesaler MSOs positioned to capture VBC transition economics.

---

## The Bear Case

1. **Regulatory backlash.** FTC could view manufacturer rebates for steering as anti-competitive. Scrutiny increasing with DOJ challenging UHG-Amedisys, anti-monopoly groups petitioning against McKesson and Cardinal deals.

2. **Integration is harder than it looks.** CVS spent $88B+ over six years acquiring Aetna, Oak Street, Signify—the whole vertical stack. Now they're considering breaking it all up (WSJ, Oct 2024). The synergies that justified vertical integration may be illusory. If the largest player can't make it work, that's a warning.

3. **In-house build.** Wholesalers build conversion intelligence internally rather than buying. Cardinal/McKesson have tech teams.

4. **Payer pushback.** If payers mandate biosimilar-first, the "steering premium" disappears. Decision moves upstream. PBM private-label biosimilars (Cordavis, Quallent, Nuvaila) capture economics instead.

5. **Kaiser's narrow margins.** Most mature integrated model (45+ years) shows only 0.3-3.2% operating margins despite full vertical integration. Integration doesn't guarantee profitability.

6. **Optum exception, not rule.** UHG success driven by profit migration from regulated insurance to unregulated services via intercompany eliminations—regulatory arbitrage, not operational synergies. Other players lack same structure.

7. **Health system divestiture trend.** Baystate, ProMedica, others selling health plans. Regional players can't make integration economics work at smaller scale.

## Startup Opportunities

**1. MSO Biosimilar Optimization Platform**
- Serve the Big 3's MSO networks (McKesson, Cencora, Cardinal)
- Systematic conversion identification across thousands of providers
- Outcome tracking and manufacturer rebate optimization
- First customer: OneOncology (1,000 providers), US Oncology (2,550 providers), or Navista network
- Wedge: Quantify $243M-type profit opportunities per MSO from biosimilar steering
- Moat: Outcomes registry data flywheel, manufacturer rebate negotiation intelligence
- GTM: Direct to MSO leadership, demonstrate incremental margin on existing patient volume
- Risk: In-house build by wholesalers, regulatory crackdown on steering payments

**2. Independent Practice Aggregator**
- Help independent oncology practices achieve MSO-like steering economics
- Virtual GPO for biosimilar rebates
- Compete with wholesaler MSOs for prescribing influence
- Wedge: Independents losing 3-5x margin advantage to MSO-affiliated competitors
- Target: 5,000+ independent oncology practices not yet acquired
- Revenue model: % of incremental rebate revenue, outcomes registry licensing
- Moat: Network effects from practice aggregation, manufacturer relationship portability
- Risk: Wholesalers acquire remaining independent practices, eliminating addressable market

**3. Payer-Side Steering Intelligence**
- Flip the model: help payers identify where to push biosimilar adoption
- Network design optimization to counter MSO steering leverage
- Aligned with payer cost reduction goals
- First customer: Regional payers losing negotiating power to vertically integrated competitors
- Wedge: Payers facing $6B in lost savings from PBM rebate schemes favoring reference products
- Value prop: Recapture biosimilar savings being captured by MSO/PBM intermediaries
- GTM: Demonstrate savings analysis on payer's own claims data
- Risk: Large payers (UHG, CVS) already vertically integrated—TAM limited to regional players

**4. VBC Transition Enabler for MSOs**
- Help wholesaler MSOs navigate from buy-and-bill to value-based care
- Two-sided risk model design, quality measure tracking, cost benchmarking
- First customer: US Oncology Network, OneOncology (already at scale for risk-bearing)
- Wedge: VBC eliminates buy-and-bill perverse incentives—MSOs need new margin model
- Timing catalyst: Medicare Oncology Care Model, commercial payer VBC mandates accelerating
- Moat: Risk model calibration data, quality-cost correlation insights
- Path to $1B+: Expand from oncology MSOs to other specialties (cardiology, orthopedics, GI)
- Risk: MSOs slow to adopt risk (protect existing buy-and-bill margins), capital requirements for risk-bearing

**Note:** A different model is emerging in employer healthcare—navigation platforms like Transcarent that steer to Centers of Excellence with capped fees ($6,500 vs. percentage-based). They're competing for the steering economics without owning practices. Key insight: industry data shows 30% of U.S. surgeries may be unnecessary. Whoever can reduce unnecessary procedures captures employer trust.

## GTM Considerations

**Market Segmentation:**

**By Integration Model:**
- Wholesaler MSOs (McKesson, Cencora, Cardinal): 4,500+ oncologists under management, focus on biosimilar steering optimization
- Payer-providers (Optum, CVS, Elevance): 120M+ lives under Optum management, focus on care delivery efficiency
- Integrated delivery systems (Kaiser, Geisinger): 12.5M+ Kaiser members, focus on total cost of care

**By Buyer Pain Point:**
- Margin compression: Independent practices losing to MSO-affiliated competitors (3-5x margin delta)
- Regulatory compliance: Navigating FTC scrutiny of steering arrangements, antitrust risk
- VBC transition: Buy-and-bill to value-based care model shift (eliminates current margin structure)
- Integration complexity: CVS-type operational challenges, intercompany revenue optimization

**Wedge Strategy:**

**Tier 1 - Demonstrate Incremental Margin:**
- Entry: Margin quantification tool (identify biosimilar conversion opportunities)
- Proof: 30-day pilot with OneOncology or US Oncology regional network
- Metric: $ per patient per month margin increase on existing volume
- Expansion trigger: Roll out across full MSO network after proof of incremental profit

**Tier 2 - Build Outcomes Registry Moat:**
- Capture: Treatment pathway data, biosimilar outcomes, patient satisfaction
- Value: Manufacturer rebate negotiation leverage (outcomes-based contracting)
- Lock-in: Data flywheel—more practices = richer dataset = better rebate terms
- Upsell: Predictive analytics, pathway optimization, quality measure reporting

**Tier 3 - Enable VBC Transition:**
- Position: Partner for MSO shift from buy-and-bill to value-based care
- Capabilities: Risk model design, quality tracking, cost benchmarking
- Revenue: % of shared savings, risk-bearing infrastructure fees
- Expansion: Horizontal across specialties beyond oncology

**Champion Identification:**

**Economic buyer (MSO leadership):**
- Pain: Biosimilar launch wave threatens reference product rebate revenue
- Motivation: Maintain 3-5x margin advantage as market fragments
- Success metric: $ incremental profit per patient per month

**Technical buyer (Chief Medical Officer/Pharmacy Director):**
- Pain: Manual biosimilar conversion identification, no systematic steering intelligence
- Motivation: Clinical pathway optimization, outcomes tracking for manufacturer negotiations
- Success metric: Conversion rate %, time to identify switching candidates

**End user (Oncologist):**
- Pain: Administrative burden of prior authorization, formulary navigation
- Motivation: Clinical decision support, simplified biosimilar prescribing
- Success metric: Minutes saved per prescription, patient satisfaction

**Timing Triggers:**

1. **M&A announcement:** Wholesaler acquiring new MSO network = integration opportunity
2. **Biosimilar launch:** New therapeutic class going off-patent = steering optimization need
3. **Regulatory change:** FTC action on rebates = compliance/restructuring demand
4. **VBC contract:** Payer mandating two-sided risk = model transition requirement
5. **Margin compression:** Quarterly earnings showing distribution margin pressure = urgency for new revenue

**Competitive Positioning:**

**Against in-house build:**
- "You're experts at distribution, not software. Outcomes registry takes 3-5 years and $50M+ to build. We have it now."
- Show data flywheel advantage: Network effects from multi-MSO registry
- Time-to-value: 30-day pilot vs. multi-year build cycle

**Against status quo (manual steering):**
- "OneOncology generated $243M incremental profit. You're leaving similar $ on table without systematic intelligence."
- Quantify opportunity cost: $ per patient per month × patient volume × current conversion rate gap

**Against payer-side tools:**
- "Payers are your adversaries in margin negotiations. Build leverage with manufacturer-funded outcomes data."
- Alignment: MSO profits from steering, payer profits from cost reduction—conflicting incentives

```

**Unit Economics:**
- ASP: $200k-1M per payer per year (based on covered lives)
- Regional payer (500k lives): $300k ARR
- TAM: 200+ regional payers + 50+ MA plans + self-funded employers = $60-120M ARR ceiling

**Revenue Model:**
- Base: Annual licensing per covered lives ($0.50-2 per member per year)
- Performance: % of realized biosimilar savings (10-15% of delta)
- Services: Network design consulting ($200k-1M per engagement)

**Comparables:**
- Cotiviti (claims analytics): $11B valuation on cost-savings optimization
- MultiPlan (network analytics): $1.5B market cap, repricing/savings focus
- Clarify Health (payer analytics): $200M+ raised, claims intelligence platform

**Risk Factors:**
- TAM ceiling: Top 3 payers (UHG, CVS, Cigna) already vertically integrated
- Limited to regional payers + self-funded employers = smaller addressable market
- Regulatory uncertainty: FTC action could help (break up MSO leverage) or hurt (reduce steering economics overall)

---

**Scenario 3: VBC Transition Infrastructure (Emerging Opportunity)**

```
Target: $60-80M ARR at 15-18x = $900M-1.44B valuation
Timeline: 7-9 years (slower, requires VBC adoption acceleration)
Gross margin: 60% initially → 75% at scale (services → software transition)

```

**Unit Economics:**
- Services ASP: $1-3M per MSO for risk model design + implementation (first 2 years)
- Platform ASP: $500k-2M annual SaaS + 2-5% of shared savings pool
- Example: $50M shared savings pool × 3% = $1.5M annual performance fee

**Revenue Model:**
- Phase 1 (services-heavy): Risk model consulting, quality measure implementation
- Phase 2 (platform transition): SaaS infrastructure for risk management, outcomes tracking
- Phase 3 (performance fees): % of shared savings, upside participation in VBC contracts

**Critical Assumption:**
- VBC adoption must accelerate beyond current ~30% Medicare, 10% commercial penetration
- Timing catalyst: Medicare mandates, commercial payer VBC requirements expanding

**Comparables:**
- Aledade (ACO enablement): $3.5B valuation (2021), VBC infrastructure for primary care
- Agilon Health (risk-bearing platform): $1.3B market cap, MSO + VBC model
- Vytalize Health (VBC platform): $200M+ raised, Medicare Advantage risk infrastructure

---

**Critical Success Factors Across All Scenarios:**

1. **First MSO/payer customer within 6 months:** Credibility requires top-tier logo (OneOncology, US Oncology, Optum, or equivalent)

2. **Proof of incremental economics:** Must demonstrate measurable $ per patient per month improvement or savings

3. **Outcomes registry build:** Data moat requires 2-3 year head start on proprietary clinical outcomes database

4. **Manufacturer partnerships:** Rebate optimization requires direct relationships with biosimilar manufacturers (Amgen, Pfizer, Samsung Bioepis, etc.)

5. **Regulatory navigation:** FTC/DOJ scrutiny requires compliance-forward positioning, potentially limits steering aggressiveness

6. **Talent density:** Need oncology clinical expertise + payer contracting + software engineering + health economics

**Capital Requirements:**
- Seed-Series A ($5-15M): MVP build, first customer proof of value, 12-18 month runway
- Series B ($25-50M): Multi-customer deployment, outcomes registry build, 24-36 month runway
- Series C+ ($75-150M): Market expansion, specialty horizontal, ecosystem partnerships

**CAC Payback Benchmarks:**
- MSO platform: <12 months (high ASP, concentrated buyers)
- Payer platform: 18-24 months (longer sales cycles, enterprise procurement)
- VBC infrastructure: 24-36 months (services-heavy initially, pilot to production timeline)

**NRR Targets:**
- Year 1-2: 100-110% (deployment expansion, provider seat growth)
- Year 3+: 120-140% (outcomes registry upsells, manufacturer partnerships, specialty expansion)

## Open Questions

### Will FTC/DOJ block further wholesaler MSO consolidation?

**Priority:** P0 (investment-blocking)

**Investment Gate:** If regulators unwind McKesson-Core Ventures or prevent future MSO acquisitions, wholesaler vertical integration thesis collapses. If deals approved, MSO steering platform opportunity validated.

**Status:** PROGRESS — McKesson-Core Ventures deal closed August 2024 without FTC block despite public pressure. This is a green light signal for MSO steering platform opportunity.

**What Happened (December 2025 Research):**
- McKesson closed acquisition of ~70% of Core Ventures (Florida Cancer Specialists) for $2.49B in August 2024
- FTC did NOT block the deal despite petitions from American Economic Liberties Project and Senator Warren arguing vertical integration creates patient harm
- Morningstar analysts stated they "do not anticipate any major legal or antitrust hurdles, given the fragmented nature of the oncology clinic industry"
- Cardinal-ION deal ($1.1B) closed December 2024 with no regulatory intervention
- Pattern: Despite public pressure and antitrust concerns, FTC has not blocked wholesaler MSO acquisitions

**Investment Implication:** This validates the MSO steering platform thesis. Regulators view oncology market as sufficiently fragmented to allow vertical integration. The "what would change my mind" scenario of FTC approval without conditions has occurred—green light to aggressively pursue wholesaler MSO customers.

**What Would Change My Mind (Updated):**
- If FTC reverses position and challenges future wholesaler MSO deals → Regulatory environment shifting hostile. Monitor closely, potentially pivot to payer-side tools or independent practice aggregation.
- If deals approved with behavioral remedies (steering restrictions) → Compliance/monitoring software opportunity. Build platform for transparent rebate reporting.
- ~~If deals approved without conditions~~ **OCCURRED** → Green light for MSO platform. Aggressively pursue wholesaler MSO customers.

**Remaining Research Questions:**
- Will FTC/DOJ retroactively challenge completed deals (McKesson-Core Ventures, Cardinal-ION)?
- Are more wholesaler MSO acquisitions planned, or is Big 3 consolidation complete?
- Interview MSO leadership on M&A pipeline and regulatory posture assumptions
- Monitor FTC pharmaceutical vertical integration policy—any shift in approach under new administration?

### Are biosimilar manufacturer rebates for steering legally defensible long-term?

**Priority:** P0 (investment-blocking)

**Investment Gate:** If rebates for prescribing steering deemed anti-competitive kickbacks, $50B+ profit pool restructuring thesis invalid. If legal, MSO steering economics sustainable.

**What Would Change My Mind:**
- If DOJ/HHS issues guidance classifying steering payments as Anti-Kickback Statute violations → Core economics illegal. Exit opportunity.
- If FTC/Congress targets PBM rebate schemes (already investigating, per Biosimilars Council) → Steering transparency required. Compliance software opportunity.
- If safe harbors established for outcomes-based rebates → Doubles down on outcomes registry strategy. Build manufacturer partnership infrastructure.

**How to Find Out:**
- Analyze FTC PBM investigation scope (September 2024 actions against CVS Caremark, OptumRx)
- Review Anti-Kickback Statute application to provider-administered drug steering (consult healthcare regulatory counsel)
- Interview biosimilar manufacturers (Amgen, Pfizer, Samsung Bioepis) on rebate contract structures and legal review processes
- Track PBM rebate legislation (transparency bills in Congress, state-level reforms)

### Can independent oncology practices compete without MSO scale?

**Priority:** P1 (thesis-changing)

**Investment Gate:** Determines TAM for independent practice aggregation opportunity. If independents can't compete, market consolidates to Big 3 MSOs only (smaller TAM, winner-take-most). If virtual GPO model works, larger fragmented market.

**What Would Change My Mind:**
- If independent practice count declining >10% annually → Consolidation inevitable. Focus on wholesaler MSO platform only.
- If virtual GPO achieves comparable rebates to MSO-affiliated practices → Fragmented market sustainable. Build independent practice aggregator.
- If payer policies (biosimilar mandates) equalize economics regardless of affiliation → MSO steering advantage diminishes. Pivot to VBC transition opportunity.

**How to Find Out:**
- Survey 50+ independent oncology practices on biosimilar rebate access, margin trends, M&A interest
- Analyze IQVIA data on independent vs. MSO-affiliated practice growth rates (2020-2025)
- Interview biosimilar manufacturers on willingness to contract with virtual GPOs vs. requiring MSO-scale aggregation
- Test virtual GPO pilot: aggregate 20-50 independent practices, negotiate manufacturer rebates, measure $ per patient per month delta vs. MSO-affiliated competitors

### What's the margin impact of VBC transition on MSO economics?

**Priority:** P1 (thesis-changing)

**Investment Gate:** If VBC eliminates buy-and-bill margin structure (currently 3-5x traditional distribution), MSOs need new economic model. Determines timing and value of VBC transition software opportunity.

**What Would Change My Mind:**
- If VBC adoption remains <30% Medicare, <10% commercial through 2028 → Buy-and-bill persists, steering economics sustainable long-term. Deprioritize VBC tools.
- If VBC mandates accelerate (CMS Innovation Center expansion, commercial payer requirements) → Urgent MSO transition need. Prioritize risk infrastructure build.
- If MSOs achieve equal/higher margins under VBC (shared savings > steering rebates) → VBC transition attractive to MSOs. Build enablement platform with performance fee upside.

**How to Find Out:**
- Model OneOncology/US Oncology economics under VBC: compare $243M biosimilar steering profit to potential shared savings pool
- Interview MSO CFOs on VBC contract pipeline, expected margin impact, infrastructure readiness
- Analyze Oncology Care Model (OCM) results: which MSOs participated, what savings achieved, margin implications?
- Survey commercial payers on VBC mandate timelines for oncology (2025-2028 rollout plans)

### Will private-label biosimilars (Cordavis, Quallent, Nuvaila) capture steering economics from MSOs?

**Priority:** P2 (opportunity-defining)

**Investment Gate:** If PBM private-label biosimilars dominate (as with adalimumab in 2024), steering economics move upstream to PBMs, reducing MSO leverage. Shifts opportunity from MSO platforms to PBM tools.

**What Would Change My Mind:**
- If private-label biosimilars achieve >50% market share in key therapeutic classes → PBMs control steering, MSO leverage diminished. Pivot to PBM formulary intelligence tools.
- If MSOs negotiate rebates from private-label PBM biosimilars → Steering economics preserved, just different payer. MSO platform opportunity intact.
- If regulatory action forces PBM private-label transparency/separation → Levels playing field. MSO steering advantage restored.

**How to Find Out:**
- Track adalimumab biosimilar market share by source (private-label vs. independent biosimilars) 2024-2025
- Monitor Stelara biosimilar launch (Lumicera private-label favored by Optum Rx, Pyzchiva by CVS Caremark)—does private-label dominate?
- Interview MSO pharmacy directors on private-label biosimilar contracting—can they negotiate rebates or does PBM dictate formulary?
- Analyze vertical integration advantage: does CVS/Optum ownership of PBM + MSO create unassailable combined steering leverage?

### How do payers respond to MSO steering leverage?

**Priority:** P2 (opportunity-defining)

**Investment Gate:** Determines balance of power in biosimilar steering—if payers mandate biosimilar-first and override MSO formularies, steering economics shift. Affects both MSO platform and payer-side tool opportunities.

**What Would Change My Mind:**
- If payers successfully mandate biosimilar-first (override MSO prescribing autonomy) → Steering premium disappears upstream. Payer-side tools become primary opportunity.
- If MSOs maintain formulary control despite payer pressure → Steering economics sustainable. MSO platform remains primary opportunity.
- If stalemate emerges (regional variation, negotiated middle ground) → Market for both MSO optimization and payer negotiation tools.

**How to Find Out:**
- Survey 20+ commercial payers on biosimilar policies: mandatory step therapy, formulary exclusions, MSO contract terms
- Interview payer medical directors on MSO negotiation dynamics—who has leverage in network contract renewals?
- Analyze claims data: biosimilar adoption rates in MSO-affiliated vs. independent practices under same payer
- Review payer-MSO contract terms (if accessible via public rate filings or industry sources) for formulary control provisions
