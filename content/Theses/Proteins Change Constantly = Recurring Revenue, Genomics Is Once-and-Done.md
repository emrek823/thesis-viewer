# Thesis: Proteins Change Constantly = Recurring Revenue; Genomics Is Once-and-Done

## Investment Take

DNA is "once and done"—you sequence it once and the medical utility is mostly cancer. Proteins change constantly—weekly, monthly, yearly—creating a recurring testing model at tens of dollars per sample ([[Alex __ Emre]]). Genomics built Illumina. Proteomics builds recurring revenue diagnostics businesses. Quanterix proves the model: 80% recurring revenue through consumables and reagents, 7 consecutive quarters double-digit growth ([[Quanterix Q3 2025 results]]).

The market is bifurcating: mass spec offers unbiased discovery but remains research-only due to complexity, while affinity-based platforms (Olink, SomaLogic, Alamar) race toward clinical diagnostics. Thermo paid $3.1B for Olink ([[Thermo Fisher Olink acquisition decision document]]). Illumina acquiring SomaLogic (H1 2026 close). Alamar raised $250M total with attomolar sensitivity (10-100x higher than competitors) ([[Alamar $128M Series C]]).

The $100B diagnostic TAM has current players capturing only 5-10%. Market: $31.8B (2023) → $100.99B (2032) at 13.7% CAGR. Reagents/kits represent 60-68% of market revenue—high-margin recurring consumables. The razor-razorblade model works: instruments as capital sale, consumables as recurring per-test revenue.

**How this evolved:**
- *2025-12-20:* Strong take from operator conversation. OLink's $3.1B acquisition validates market. Illumina's SomaLogic acquisition signals genomics giants recognize proteomics as next recurring revenue frontier.

## Bull Case

- [ ] **Recurring revenue > one-time.** Quanterix 80% recurring revenue. Reagents/kits 60-68% of market. Model proven.
  - *Evidence:* [[Quanterix Q3 2025 results]] — 7 consecutive quarters double-digit growth

- [ ] **Strategic M&A validates market.** Thermo paid $3.1B for Olink. Illumina acquiring SomaLogic. Danaher bought Abcam.
  - *Evidence:* [[Thermo Fisher Olink acquisition decision document]] — Genomics giants recognize proteomics

- [ ] **Sensitivity breakthroughs enabling new use cases.** Alamar's attomolar detection unlocks early disease detection previously impossible.
  - *Evidence:* [[Alamar $128M Series C]] — 10-100x sensitivity vs Olink/SomaLogic

---

## Bear Case

- [ ] **Reimbursement unclear.** MolDX jurisdictional confusion. Payers demand clinical utility evidence, not just analytical validity. Most tests lack RCT data.
  - *Evidence:* Needs validation — Survey payer medical directors on evidence requirements

- [ ] **Technology fragmentation.** Multiple platforms (mass spec, antibody, aptamer) with no standard. Cross-platform results uncorrelated.
  - *Evidence:* [[Bridging proteomics to clinic]] — Benzon Foundation Symposium: standardization critical barrier

- [ ] **Clinical adoption slow.** Physicians trained on genomics/chemistry panels. Mass spec requires PhD operators. Even affinity platforms need specialized training.
  - *Evidence:* Needs monitoring — Track clinical lab proteomics adoption rates

## Startup Opportunities

**1. Disease-Specific Recurring Proteomics Diagnostics**
- Longitudinal protein monitoring for chronic diseases (Alzheimer's, oncology, metabolic syndrome)
- Why this follows: Proteins change → recurring tests → superior LTV. Quanterix proves it with Alzheimer's (12 partnerships).
- Revenue: DTC subscription $50-200/quarter + payer B2B2C with outcomes contracts
- Risk: Reimbursement uncertain. Requires clinical validation ($10M+).

**2. Proteomics Standardization & QC Platform**
- Cross-platform standardization: sample handling, QC reagents, data normalization, benchmarking
- Why this follows: Benzon Foundation identified standardization as #1 barrier. No one bridges platforms.
- Revenue: QC reagents $5-20k/lab/year + software $10-100k/year + consulting for trials
- Risk: Platform vendors may resist third-party standardization.

**3. AI Bioinformatics for Clinical Proteomics Interpretation**
- Explainable AI: 11,000 proteins → top 10 actionable insights with evidence links
- Why this follows: Physicians can't interpret 11,000 values. "Black box" AI makes them nervous. Need clinical decision support.
- Revenue: $50-500k/year per health system + per-test licensing $10-50
- Risk: Platform vendors may build in-house. Liability concerns for misinterpretation.

## Open Questions

**What's payer appetite for recurring protein panels beyond Alzheimer's and oncology?**
→ PROGRESS (Dec 2025): Indication-specific coverage advancing. PromarkerD (diabetic kidney disease) got $390.75 Medicare reimbursement via PLA code 0579U (Jan 2025). Quanterix Alzheimer's received positive Medicare pricing recommendation. BUT general proteomics faces "fee schedule paradoxes"—few historical codes, $10-20 fixed rates, 10X pricing variation by coding choice. Path is indication-specific, not broad chronic disease panels.

**Is mass spec or affinity-based winning for clinical diagnostics?**
→ OPEN: If automated mass spec achieves <2hrs hands-on time and <$100/sample, it becomes clinically viable. Track FDA IVD submissions by platform type.

**Will standardization become regulatory requirement for IVD approval?**
→ OPEN: If FDA mandates cross-platform validation within 3-5 years, standardization infrastructure becomes mission-critical. Engage FDA Division of Clinical Chemistry on guidance development.
