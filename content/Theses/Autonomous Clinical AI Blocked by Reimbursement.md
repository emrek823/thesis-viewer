# Thesis: Autonomous Clinical AI Blocked by Reimbursement

## Investment Take

Healthcare AI is stratified into four levels—and only Level 0-1 is investable today. Level 0 (administrative: scribes, scheduling) and Level 1 (assistive: coaches, navigators) are capturing $1B+ in revenue. But Level 2 (supervised autonomous: AI prescribing with physician oversight) and Level 3 (fully autonomous: AI diagnosis without human) are effectively illegal ([[A Vision for Healthcare AI in America  Posts  8VC]]).

The blockers are structural:
1. **No CPT codes.** Assistive AI doesn't match AMA-defined billing codes. No reimbursement = no investment.
2. **State practice acts.** All 50 states prohibit AI from prescribing, diagnosing, or referring without medical license.
3. **FDA bottleneck.** Only ~2% of approved SaMD has authorized PCCPs. Reviews too slow, standards too high.
4. **Social Security Act.** Section 1861 doesn't list AI as eligible for Medicare payments.

The opportunity: Admin AI (scribes, RCM) is crowded—Commure, Candid, Hello Patient already at scale. Clinical autonomy is the 10x opportunity but requires regulatory catalysts: CMMI reimbursement models, state Medical AI Practice Acts, FDA Center for AI.

**The investment angle:** Avoid Level 0 crowding. Position for Level 2-3 by building clinical capabilities that can activate when regulation unlocks. Watch 2026-2027 for CMMI models and state legislation.

**How this evolved:**
- *2025-12-22:* 8VC's regulatory analysis crystallized the four-level framework and specific policy blockers. Level 0-1 vs 2-3 is the key investment distinction.

## Bull Case

- [ ] **CMMI creates reimbursement pathway.** If CMMI launches assistive/autonomous AI models, capital floods in.
  - *Evidence:* [[A Vision for Healthcare AI in America  Posts  8VC]] — Proposes CMMI model for value-based AI payments

- [ ] **States pass Medical AI Practice Acts.** If even 5-10 states create AI licensure, market opens.
  - *Evidence:* Needs monitoring — Track state legislation in CA, TX, FL, NY

- [ ] **FDA creates Center for AI.** Dedicated AI review center would accelerate approvals.
  - *Evidence:* [[A Vision for Healthcare AI in America  Posts  8VC]] — Proposes FDA CAI with HHS authority

- [ ] **Medicare beneficiary demographics force action.** 2 workers per retiree by 2030. AI is only politically viable cost solution.
  - *Evidence:* [[A Vision for Healthcare AI in America  Posts  8VC]] — Medicare demographics analysis

## Bear Case

- [ ] **AMA protects physician monopoly.** Medical associations will lobby hard against AI licensure.
  - *Evidence:* [[A Vision for Healthcare AI in America  Posts  8VC]] — AMA seeks to "thwart AI systems while veiled behind concern for safety"

- [ ] **State-by-state fragmentation.** 50 different markets with unique requirements. CA, NV, TX already adding restrictions.
  - *Evidence:* [[A Vision for Healthcare AI in America  Posts  8VC]] — Heterogeneous state laws (CA disclosure, NV mental health ban, TX localization)

- [ ] **Level 0-1 winners lock up distribution.** If Commure/Abridge win admin AI, they become clinical AI gatekeepers.
  - *Evidence:* Needs monitoring — Track admin AI winners expanding to clinical

- [ ] **Liability uncertainty.** Who's responsible when AI misdiagnoses? Unclear liability kills investment.
  - *Evidence:* Needs validation — Interview health system legal/risk officers

## Startup Opportunities

**1. Pre-Position for Level 2**
- Build clinical capabilities (medication management, triage) that activate when reimbursement unlocks
- Why this follows: First movers with clinical data + regulatory readiness will win
- Risk: Regulatory timeline uncertain—could be 2-5 years

**2. Medicaid-First Pilot**
- Medicaid section 1905 may have more flexibility than Medicare 1861
- Why this follows: State-level authority, underserved populations, desperate for cost savings
- Risk: Medicaid populations harder to serve, lower reimbursement

**3. Employer/Cash-Pay Clinical AI**
- Bypass insurance entirely. Employers pay for autonomous triage, medication management.
- Why this follows: Employers desperate to cut costs, no CPT code needed
- Risk: Limited scale without insurance reimbursement

## Open Questions

**When will CMMI launch AI reimbursement models?**
→ OPEN: Track CMS innovation announcements. Biden HTI-1 rule may be modified under new administration.

**Which states will move first on Medical AI Practice Acts?**
→ OPEN: Florida, Texas often lead on healthcare deregulation. Track 2025-2026 legislative sessions.

**Will FDA create Center for AI?**
→ OPEN: Requires FDA commissioner + HHS secretary action. New administration may prioritize.
