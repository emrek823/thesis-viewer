# Thesis: Buy Services at 3x, Automate, Sell at 10x

## Investment Take

Services businesses in healthcare (RCM, credentialing, billing, intake) are ripe for AI arbitrage: acquire manual service providers at 2-3x EBITDA, implement AI automation, achieve 10x profit growth while maintaining service pricing. The wedge is distribution—service providers already have relationships with hundreds of small clinics. AI turns labor cost savings into pure margin.

The math: $1M revenue, $600K labor (60%), $100K profit → automate 75% of labor → $550K profit → valuation jumps from $300K (3x EBITDA) to $5.5M (10x). R1 RCM acquired at 15.4x EBITDA ($6.9B), GeBBS at 17x. AI-powered healthcare solutions command 26.8x revenue multiples ([[Monthly Sync_ Gyde _ Virtue]]).

JV model de-risks execution: partner with existing operator (60:40 split), AI platform replaces manual labor, first year typically 10x profit growth. Pittsburgh credentialer JV projecting exactly this (NextGenMed - Sam Slezek). But execution harder than claimed—Bain/Norwest spent 18+ months with LOIs, no closings. Banks won't send deals to inexperienced teams.

Geographic arbitrage compounds: Unit economics vary 3-5x by market. Massachusetts = expensive labor, okay rates, stiff competition. Missouri = "outrageously" cheap labor, "insane" rates. Acquire in favorable markets, integrate AI, expand footprint ([[Anu and Virtue]]).

Real-world automation case study: A SNF central billing office went from 500 FTEs to <80 with automation—84% labor reduction while improving collections from <$0.90 to $0.98 on the dollar (WellSky RCM Tegus). Large health systems are 70% automated; small/mid-size are 40-50%—the opportunity is in the long tail. Mid-cycle (clinical denials) is the #1 pain point: $20M+ in clinical denials for 15 hospitals.

The AI vendor landscape is fragmenting by use case: Anterior AI rated 8/10 for clinical reasoning, reduces manual 70-75% (Elevance Anterior Tegus). Plenful winning pharmacy RCM over Latent and Mandolin (LifePoint Plenful Tegus). But "AI is a code word"—not all vendors deliver real automation.

**How this evolved:**
- *2025-12-20:* Cluster of 5 portfolio/pipeline meetings revealed pattern: services businesses at 50%+ labor cost where AI can automate 60-80% while retaining 100% revenue.
- *2025-12-20:* Added execution reality check—VCs claim roll-ups but most aren't closing. Requires domain expertise + deal sourcing network.
- *2025-12-21:* Tegus calls validate 84% labor reduction achievable. Mid-cycle/clinical denials biggest opportunity. Vendor fragmentation by use case.
- *2025-12-21:* Charta Health (pre-bill AI) beating SmarterDx and Brellium. PAM Health seeing "initial positivity on denial reduction" after 3 months. Expert: "Imagine 100% chart reviews through AI tool" vs 10% spot checks. Six-week setup, low six-figures pricing. Payer-side opportunity: reverse-engineer prior auth systems.
- *2025-12-21:* **Payment integrity is massive.** Cotiviti: $9.5B payment waste recovered annually, 78%+ renewal rate. Pre-pay market is $9B vs post-pay $2-3B—shift happening. Optum: $900B total healthcare waste target, but current funnel only 3% success rate (100K flagged → 3,150 recoveries). 70% false positives costing $7M+/year in analyst time. CodaMetrix: 70%+ autonomous coding vs 20-40% competitors, $9.5B TAM. Tennr: fax wrangling reduced team 5→2 FTEs, rated 9/10.

## Bull Case

- [x] **Multiple arbitrage proven.** R1 RCM at 15.4x EBITDA, GeBBS at 17x. AI-powered = 26.8x revenue. Buy at 3x, sell at 10x = 3x return before growth.
  - *Evidence:* [[Monthly Sync_ Gyde _ Virtue]] — Market multiples validated

- [ ] **Distribution is the moat.** Service providers already serve 100s of clinics. No sales motion needed. Only 15% of AI projects procured from startups.
  - *Evidence:* NextGenMed - Sam Slezek — Pittsburgh credentialer has existing relationships

- [ ] **AI quality crossed threshold.** 63% of healthcare organizations integrated AI-powered RCM in 2024. 98% expect to use by 2025.
  - *Evidence:* Needs validation — Track actual ROI achieved (only 15% positive in 2024)

---

## Bear Case

- [ ] **Execution harder than claimed.** VCs claim roll-ups but most aren't executing. a16z has one deal. Bain/Norwest 18+ months with LOIs, no closings.
  - *Evidence:* [[Monthly Sync_ Gyde _ Virtue]] — "Banks won't send deals to inexperienced teams"

- [ ] **Race to bottom.** If everyone automates, margin advantage competes away. 63% already integrating AI, 98% expect to by 2025.
  - *Evidence:* Needs monitoring — Track RCM pricing trends over 12-24 months

- [ ] **Incumbents wake up.** EHR vendors bundle AI capabilities. Epic, Athena add native automation. Optum launched AI claims platform (20% denial reduction).
  - *Evidence:* Needs monitoring — Track Epic/Athena AI feature releases

## Startup Opportunities

**1. RCM AI + JV Roll-Up (NextGenMed model)**
- Target small credentialers/billers ($1-5M revenue), 60:40 JV, implement AI platform
- Why this follows: Services distribution bypasses startup procurement barrier (15% market)
- Revenue: Platform fee + share of margin improvement
- Risk: Finding good operators at scale. Bain/Norwest evidence of execution gap.

**2. Home Care Intake Automation (Clara model)**
- AI call recording + post-call recommendations, reduce 100-min workflow to 10 min
- Why this follows: Legacy systems so broken ("WellSky is terrible") any improvement wins
- Revenue: Per-intake fee, immediate ROI
- Risk: Fragmented home care market, legacy EMR integrations

**3. Ambient Documentation → RCM Roll-Up**
- Acquire manual transcription at 2-3x, deploy ambient AI, expand to CDI → Coding → Full RCM
- Why this follows: Ambient documentation $600M market (+2.4x YoY), proven wedge expansion
- Revenue: Per-encounter fees, expand to % of collections
- Risk: Abridge (30%), Nuance (33%) already dominant

## Open Questions

**Can JV model scale beyond first few deals?**
→ OPEN: If NextGenMed closes 5+ JVs in 12 months, scalable. If stuck at 1-2, opportunistic not systematic. Track pipeline velocity.

**Will 98% AI adoption compress margins?**
→ OPEN: If early adopters maintain pricing despite automation, margin expansion sustainable. If pricing pressure emerges, first-mover advantage critical.

**Is services-to-software conversion achievable?**
→ OPEN: If JVs convert to platform licensing after 2-3 years, valuation re-rates 6-8x → 10-12x. If operators resist, stuck in services margin profile.
