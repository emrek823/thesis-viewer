## The Take

**$472M market growing to $11.7B by 2035 (37.85% CAGR). Voice AI platforms capture the 40% of scheduling volume that doesn't convert to online self-service—through a three-step trap: labor crisis forces adoption, specialty-specific algorithms create customization lock-in, and post-staffing cuts make switching operationally impossible. Strategic buyers validating category—Assort raised $102M, Tennr at $605M valuation, Zocdoc launched Zo.**

[MEDIUM-HIGH CONFIDENCE: 18+ operator sources, $200M+ funding validation. Weakened by patient self-service preference (89% want online) and 95% gen AI pilot failure rate]

> "My company could not untangle themselves from Tennr if we tried at this point. **It would be disastrous.**" — [[manager-at-betternight-_-tennr-_-tegus-3c373487]]

**Consensus believes:** AI scheduling is a feature EHR vendors will bundle. Epic and athena will commoditize it. Patients prefer online self-service anyway—89% want to book online. Voice AI is a declining modality.

**Actually:** 40% of calls still come from patients who won't use self-service—and that's $30B in annual health system call center spend. EHR integration depth + specialty-specific algorithms + post-staffing dependency creates a switching cost moat that takes 2-3 months to build. Athena announced AI-native features for 2026, but focus is ambient documentation (physician problem) not specialty scheduling (call center problem). Lock-in evidence overwhelming: "would need an act of God to switch" after implementation.

**In 5 years:** 2-3 dominant voice AI platforms per specialty vertical (retina, ortho, dental, DME, hospice). Voice AI becomes complement to online self-service, not replacement—capturing the "phone-first" patient segment. Winners expand from scheduling to referrals, prior auth, and prescription refills. Market consolidates as point solutions fail pilot-to-production conversion.

## Investment Take

**Today:** Voice AI works—but only for practices willing to do the hard integration work. 95% of gen AI pilots fail because companies skip the operational foundation.

Half of U.S. hospitals plan to implement voice AI by 2026. Houston Methodist projects 25-50% cost reduction in scheduling, registration, and prior authorization. Tampa General rolled out Hyro in 3 months. The pull market is real because healthcare workforce shortages hit crisis level—projections show 3.2M worker shortage by 2026. Call centers see 45% annual turnover. Practices can't hire fast enough.

But Jeremy Schwach's reality check is sobering: most voice AI delivers "marginal improvements"—comprehensive scheduling reduced from 14 weeks to 12 weeks. LinkedIn AI success stories are "mostly hype"—founders admit limited enterprise P&L impact behind closed doors. Only 25% of AI initiatives have delivered expected ROI. The problem isn't the AI—it's that practices haven't done the foundational work (Epic optimization, process standardization, operational alignment) that makes AI effective.

**The startup advantage is specialty depth.** Athena's AI roadmap focuses on ambient documentation and RCM—physician problems, not call center problems. The 28-day injection spacing rules for retina, body-part routing for ortho, phone lookup features for dental DSOs—this operational knowledge takes months to accumulate and isn't on any EHR vendor's priority list.

**The moat is post-implementation dependency.** BetterNight went from 40 admins to 5 with Tennr. Barrington Ortho went from 7 FTEs to 4 with Assort. Once staff is cut, switching would require re-hiring—and those workers no longer exist. "If they decided to increase our spend by $10,000 a month, at this point I'd have to say yes."

**New entrant risk:** Zocdoc launched Zo at $2/booked appointment with 70% resolution rate. Aggressive pricing could commoditize the low-end. But Zocdoc lacks specialty depth—28-day retina rules and multi-location routing complexity exceed their generic platform.

**In 3-5 years:** Market structure bifurcates. Generic voice (simple appointment confirmations, wait time announcements) gets commoditized by Zocdoc and EHR bundling. Specialty voice (complex scheduling rules, multi-location routing, referral processing) remains standalone with high switching costs. Winners are those who (1) captured specialty depth early, (2) expanded beyond scheduling to referrals/PA, and (3) built platform lock-in before consolidation wave.

**How this evolved:**
- *2026-01-26:* **REBUILD** — Added Jeremy Schwach primary research. New threats: patient preference for online self-service (89%), 95% gen AI pilot failure rate, Zocdoc Zo at $2/appointment, healthcare AI in "trough of disillusionment." Counter: voice captures phone-first segment (40%+), specialty depth exceeds generic competitors, lock-in evidence overwhelming. Confidence dropped HIGH → MEDIUM-HIGH.
- *2026-01-26:* Prior rebuild. Contrarian: athena AI-native 2026 with voice features, Epic Art rumors, 67% ambient scribe switch willingness.
- *2026-01-10:* Initial rebuild with 8+ Tegus sources. Lock-in mechanism validated.
- *2026-01-10:* Auto-generated from /new-thesis clustering of 18 Tegus expert interviews.

## Bull Case

- [x] **Practices cannot switch after cutting staff.** "Could not untangle from Tennr if we tried... would be disastrous." 100 admins → 5 admins. "$10K/month price increase—I'd have to say yes." ([[manager-at-betternight-_-tennr-_-tegus-3c373487]])

- [x] **40% abandonment → 6% with voice AI.** Barrington Ortho: wait times 15-20 min → 2.5 min. Patient satisfaction 3.4 → 3.9/5. 9-10/10 vendor rating. ([[Chief Executive Officer at Barrington Orthopedic Specialists _ Assort Health _ Tegus]])

- [x] **Specialty customization takes 2-3 months.** Retina 28-day injection rules, ortho body-part routing, dental phone lookup. "January through April was the designated build-period." ([[Chief Administrative Officer at a Medical Group _ Assort Health _ Tegus]])

- [x] **EHR integration is decisive selection criterion.** "Plug and play" vs "exporting data and CSV files." Implementation 10 days (Assort) vs 3.5 weeks (Parakeet). ([[it-manager-at-luminary-hospice-_-assort-health-_-tegus-991d060b]])

- [x] **Market growing 37.85% CAGR.** $472M (2025) → $11.7B (2035). Assort listed as key player by Grand View Research.

- [x] **Funding validates category.** Assort $102M total (Digital Health 50). Tennr $162M total ($605M valuation). Zocdoc launched Zo.

- [x] **ROI is undeniable when implemented correctly.** 8-12x ROI at TrustCare. "Downsized 22 people at avg $50K/year." Low six-figure contracts for practices.

- [x] **95% accuracy on specialty workflows.** "Assort was answering about 4,000-5,000 calls a month and has about a 95% accuracy rate in scheduling those appointments." ([[Chief Administrative Officer at a Medical Group _ Assort Health _ Tegus]])

- [ ] **DSO exclusive partnership announced.** Would prove thesis at enterprise scale.

---

## Bear Case

- [x] **89% of patients want online self-service scheduling.** Only 6% of appointments booked online currently, but patient preference is clear. "Patients want OpenTable experience." (Web: Experian Health 2024)

- [x] **95% of gen AI pilots fail.** MIT research. "Many companies stuck in AI pilot purgatory." Only 25% of AI initiatives delivered expected ROI. (Web: CIO Dive, IBM CEO Survey)

- [x] **Most voice AI is "marginal improvements."** Jeremy Schwach: "Comprehensive scheduling reduced from 14 weeks to 12 weeks using AI." Limited enterprise P&L impact. ([[Sources/Granola/Jeremy Schwach and Virtue]])

- [x] **67% of ambient scribe users would switch vendors.** "Customers view scribing as becoming commoditized, and current switching costs are low." ([[menlo-ventures-2025]])

- [x] **Athena launching AI-native encounter 2026.** "Intelligent appointment scheduling" at no extra cost. athenaAmbient FREE starting Feb 2026. ([[athenahealth-ai-native-2026]])

- [x] **Zocdoc Zo at $2/booked appointment.** 70% resolution rate. No upfront fees. Aggressive commoditization threat for generic scheduling. (Web: Fierce Healthcare)

- [x] **Voice tech commoditized to $9/hr.** OpenAI Realtime API: $0.06/min input, $0.24/min output. Cheaper than call center worker. ([[voice-ai-2259d27c]])

- [x] **Epic Art scribe at $80/provider/month rumors.** Bundling compresses margins. KLAS shows Epic won 70% of 2024 hospital decisions.

- [x] **Security "essentially non-existent" across AI startups.** Third-party connectors, unclear data handling. "Business death risk if data leaks." ([[Sources/Granola/Jeremy Schwach and Virtue]])

- [ ] **Major practice successfully switches voice AI vendor.** Would weaken lock-in thesis.

- [ ] **Healthcare staffing crisis resolves.** Vacancy rates below 20% would reduce pull market.

## The Counter Thesis

The strongest counter-argument: **patients don't want robot conversations—they want OpenTable-style online booking.**

Jeremy Schwach nails this: "Real solutions existed pre-AI; roadblocks remain operational/political, not technical." 89% of patients want to schedule online. Only 6% of appointments are booked online today—not because the tech doesn't exist, but because health systems haven't done the foundational work (Epic optimization, workflow standardization, operational alignment) to enable self-service.

Voice AI may be solving the wrong problem. Instead of building better phone robots, the winner might be whoever solves the operational blockers to online self-service. Companies like Hummingbird Healthcare are betting on this: do the "hard work under the hood" to enable existing tools, rather than adding new AI layers.

**Why this counter might be right:**
1. 89% patient preference for online self-service is overwhelming
2. 95% gen AI pilot failure rate suggests voice AI faces same adoption challenges
3. Most voice AI delivers "marginal improvements"—not transformational change
4. Zocdoc's $2/appointment pricing could commoditize the entire category
5. Epic running 200+ AI pilots with full template access—will replicate 30-year playbook

**Why I still believe in specialty voice AI:**
1. 40%+ of patients still call—self-service adoption will take years, not months
2. Ambient scribes ≠ voice scheduling. Different workflow, different buyer (physician vs call center), different switching cost dynamics
3. Athena's AI roadmap is ambient documentation and RCM—physician problems. Voice scheduling is call center problem. Historical EHR underinvestment in patient-facing communication.
4. Lock-in evidence is overwhelming: "could not untangle," "act of God to switch," "would be disastrous"
5. Specialty customization (28-day retina rules, ortho body-part routing) is operational knowledge EHRs won't prioritize
6. Post-staffing cuts create permanent dependency—not about tech but about missing workforce
7. Zocdoc lacks specialty depth—generic scheduling can't handle complex workflows

The window for commoditization is 18-24 months. By the time athena ships competitive specialty voice, Assort will have 5+ years of customization and customers will have cut staff.

## Startup Opportunities

**1. Specialty Voice AI Platform (Assort/Flip Model)**
- Why this follows: Labor crisis + specialty algorithms + lock-in
- Wedge: Start with one specialty (retina, ortho, dental), prove 95%+ accuracy, expand to adjacent
- Stage: Series B/C—need evidence of NRR >130%, multi-specialty expansion
- Risk: Athena bundling, Zocdoc commoditization, patient shift to self-service
- Watch for: DSO exclusive partnerships, expansion beyond scheduling

**2. DME/Hospice Voice + Referral Bundle (Tennr Model)**
- Why this follows: Referral automation has "no real competitors" per operator interviews
- Wedge: Fax-to-EHR automation for referral processing + voice
- Stage: Tennr at $605M valuation, 300-400% efficiency improvement
- Risk: Different wedge than pure voice; integration complexity
- Watch for: Merger with scheduling vendor, expansion to voice

**3. Managed Services + AI Layer (Hummingbird Model)**
- Why this follows: Jeremy Schwach thesis—"Technology alone can't solve our access problems"
- Wedge: Do the "hard work under the hood" (Epic optimization, process standardization), add AI on top
- Stage: Hummingbird raised $20M Series B. Bundled offering beats point solutions
- Risk: Higher human capital intensity, slower growth than pure software
- Watch for: Voice AI partnerships, expansion beyond Epic customers

**4. Infrastructure Layer (Stedi/API Model)**
- Why this follows: "If you find an AI solution making calls to Stedi, I would be encouraged." Insurance payer database as foundation.
- Wedge: API-first insurance verification → voice AI layer
- Stage: Early—infrastructure plays underway
- Risk: Horizontal competition, healthcare-specific complexity

## Watch For

**If RIGHT (thesis plays out):**
- Assort announces $100M ARR or S-1 filing by 2027
- Major DSO announces exclusive voice AI partnership
- Athena explicitly partners with (vs competes against) standalone voice vendors
- Practice churn data shows <5% logo churn at voice AI vendors
- Voice AI vendors expand to prior auth and referrals
- Online self-service adoption stalls below 30%

**If WRONG (thesis fails):**
- Athena ships voice scheduling with 95%+ specialty accuracy at no incremental cost
- Multiple practices successfully switch voice AI vendors within 30 days
- Epic Art includes voice scheduling and achieves >50% adoption in 18 months
- Healthcare staffing crisis resolves—call center vacancy below 20%
- Patient self-service adoption exceeds 50%—voice AI becomes niche
- Zocdoc Zo captures specialty segment with custom workflows
- New entrant wins significant share without specialty customization

## Contrarian Results Summary

| Query | Finding | Threat Level | Impact |
|-------|---------|--------------|--------|
| "voice AI healthcare failed pilots" | MIT: 95% gen AI pilots fail. Only 25% deliver ROI. | **HIGH** | Major concern—but failures are from skipping operational foundation, not AI itself |
| "patients prefer online self-service" | 89% want online. "OpenTable experience" in healthcare. | **HIGH** | Validates Jeremy Schwach. Voice AI is complement, not replacement |
| "Zocdoc voice AI Zo scheduling" | $2/booked appointment. 70% resolution. No upfront fees. | **HIGH** | Commoditization threat for generic scheduling. BUT lacks specialty depth |
| "Epic athena native voice 2026" | athenaAmbient FREE Feb 2026. Epic Art early 2026. | **MEDIUM** | Real threat BUT focus is ambient documentation, not specialty scheduling |
| "Assort Tennr problems complaints" | No significant complaints. 4.6/5 satisfaction. | **LOW** | Strengthens thesis |
| "healthcare AI hype overpromise" | "Trough of disillusionment" coming. Only 25% ROI delivery. | **HIGH** | Validates Jeremy's "marginal improvements" assessment |

**BIGGEST THREAT:** Patient preference for online self-service (89%) + 95% gen AI pilot failure rate + Zocdoc's $2/appointment commoditization threat.

**HOW ADDRESSED:** Voice AI captures the 40%+ who still call and won't use self-service. Specialty depth (28-day retina rules, ortho body-part routing) exceeds generic competitors like Zocdoc. Lock-in from post-staffing cuts remains intact—"could not untangle if we tried." Pilot failures come from skipping operational foundation, not AI technology itself. Companies that do the integration work see 40%→6% abandonment rates and 95% accuracy.

---

**VERDICT: WEAKENED but CONFIRMED**

The thesis holds with MEDIUM-HIGH confidence. Jeremy Schwach's primary research introduces important nuance: most voice AI delivers marginal improvements, patients prefer online self-service, and the "hard work under the hood" matters more than AI innovation. New threats—95% pilot failure rate, 89% patient preference for online booking, Zocdoc's $2/appointment pricing—weaken the bull case.

However, the core lock-in mechanism remains overwhelmingly validated: "could not untangle," "act of God to switch," "would be disastrous." Specialty depth is real (28-day retina rules, 95% accuracy). Post-staffing dependency creates permanent switching costs. The thesis survives but must be understood as voice AI capturing the "phone-first" patient segment (40%+), not universal scheduling capture.

---

*Confidence: MEDIUM-HIGH — 18+ independent operator sources confirm lock-in mechanism. $200M+ funding validates market. BUT 95% pilot failure rate, 89% patient self-service preference, and Zocdoc commoditization are real threats. Thesis holds for specialty voice AI with deep integration.*
*Last rebuilt: 2026-01-26*
*Contrarian threats: Patient self-service preference (HIGH), gen AI pilot failures (HIGH), Zocdoc commoditization (HIGH), Athena bundling (MEDIUM). All addressed—specialty depth and post-staffing dependency create durable switching costs for operators who do the integration work.*
