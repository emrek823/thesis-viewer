# Thesis: 40% BMET Retirement Means AI-Native Is the Only Path

## Investment Take

Hospital equipment maintenance is a $22B market running on 1990s tools while 40% of the technician workforce retires. 7,300 openings/year vs 400 graduates/year (18:1 gap). 30 BMET programs closed in 5 years; 23 states have no training pathway ([[claude compass_artifact_wf-47eb8b48-df83-488d-a269-b71800dd5639_text_markdown]]).

AI-native predictive maintenance isn't optional—it's the only path through a structural labor shortage. Industrial IoT has proven 99.9% failure detection (Augury). GE OnWatch achieves 60% downtime reduction, Philips 30% via 1M events + 200K sensor readings/day per MRI. Healthcare is 5 years behind. Same physics, same ML, different regulatory wrapper.

The wedge is cybersecurity mandates (FDA Section 524B) that force hospitals to track devices. Change Healthcare ($2.9B losses), Ascension ($1.1B impact) elevated device security to board priority. Once you're tracking for compliance, predictive maintenance is natural upsell. First mover to aggregate cross-OEM equipment fault data builds the Tempus of medical devices.

TRIMEDX (1.7M+ devices, $200M+ tech investment, TRIMEDX-AIQ launched Dec 2025) confirms incumbent awakening but also validates market. PE ownership (TowerBrook $800M continuation fund) creates pressure that may limit investment horizon.

**How this evolved:**
- *2025-12-20:* Core insight validated: structural labor shortage + regulatory mandates + proven industrial AI = inevitable market restructuring. TRIMEDX-AIQ launch confirms incumbents see the same opportunity.

## Bull Case

- [x] **Structural labor shortage.** 18:1 gap (7,300 needed vs 400 graduates). Not cyclical—demographic. AI is only solution.
  - *Evidence:* [[claude compass_artifact_wf-47eb8b48-df83-488d-a269-b71800dd5639_text_markdown]] — 30 programs closed, 23 states without training

- [ ] **Regulatory tailwind.** FDA Section 524B + HIPAA force device tracking. Once tracking, predictive is obvious upsell.
  - *Evidence:* Change Healthcare $2.9B losses, Ascension $1.1B — cybersecurity now board-level

- [ ] **Industrial IoT proven.** Augury 99.9% failure detection. GE OnWatch 60% downtime reduction. Technology risk is low.
  - *Evidence:* [[claude compass_artifact_wf-47eb8b48-df83-488d-a269-b71800dd5639_text_markdown]] — Philips: 1M events + 200K readings/day → 30% downtime reduction

---

## Bear Case

- [ ] **OEM competition.** GE/Siemens/Philips investing in digital services. Could bundle AI with equipment sales.
  - *Evidence:* GE Edison, Siemens Teamplay, Philips HealthSuite — all building predictive

- [ ] **TRIMEDX $200M+ investment.** Incumbent not asleep. 6.1M device records, 90-95% US visibility.
  - *Evidence:* TRIMEDX-AIQ launched Dec 15, 2025

- [ ] **OEM data access fragmentation.** Proprietary gateways, not open APIs. Integration painful.
  - *Evidence:* Needs validation — interview GE Edison partners on integration costs

## Startup Opportunities

**1. Multi-Vendor Predictive Maintenance Platform**
- Cross-OEM equipment fault aggregation, time-series ML, anomaly detection
- Why this follows: OEMs only service own equipment, TRIMEDX is labor-intensive
- Wedge: Start with cybersecurity/SBOM compliance (regulatory mandate)
- Risk: Need OEM partnerships for data access

**2. SMB Healthcare Equipment Platform (UptimeHealth model)**
- Target dental, urgent care, ambulatory surgery—faster sales cycles
- Why this follows: Underserved segment, less integration complexity
- Validation: UptimeHealth $6M revenue, 40%+ YoY, acquired Dental Whale
- Risk: Lower ACV, need high volume

**3. Edge-to-Cloud AI Infrastructure**
- Edge (<100ms) → Fog (hospital data center) → Cloud (ML training)
- Why this follows: HIPAA requires PHI on-premise; edge-native solves latency + compliance
- Risk: Horizontal infrastructure play, less defensible

## Open Questions

**Is OEM data access problem solvable?**
→ OPEN: If partnerships <$50K/year per OEM, green light. If blocked, need to acquire ISO for data access. Interview GE Edison partners on cost/time/quality.

**Can startups compete with TRIMEDX's $200M tech investment?**
→ OPEN: Track TRIMEDX-AIQ deployment—if "good enough" enterprise software, startup wedge exists. If truly AI-native, window narrow.

**What's the right wedge: cybersecurity vs predictive vs asset tracking?**
→ OPEN: Survey 20 clinical engineering leaders on buying priorities. Track which category has fastest RFP volume.
