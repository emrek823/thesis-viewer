# Thesis: 5,950 Biotechs Run on Excel; Intelligence Layer Wide Open

## Investment Take

Biopharma operations tooling only serves the top 50 companies. The remaining 5,950 run trials on Excel, manage CDMOs through email, and guess at clinical supply ([[Jake __ Virtue]]). Only 50 of 6,000 pharma companies do systematic clinical supply forecasting. The rest rely on 7-10 day consultant turnaround—accessible only to top 50.

Virtual biotechs with 10-person teams can't navigate the CDMO constellation: drug substance → drug product → vial filling → specialty manufacturing. Each handoff is manual. No single platform connects them. 301 CDMO partnerships announced in 2025 alone, fragmenting into cell & gene (80+ announcements), ADCs (30+), biosimilars, mRNA ([[Quinn Johns and Virtue]]).

The intelligence layer connecting process design → CDMO selection → supply forecasting → trial optimization is wide open. This isn't workflow software—it's an intelligence platform that captures operational decision-making as proprietary data moat. Thermo Fisher's $8.875B Clario acquisition validates the thesis: platforms aggregating trial operational data command premium valuations ([[Thermo Fisher Scientific to Acquire Clario Holdings, Inc., Enabling Pharma and Biotech Customers to Accelerate Innovation with Deeper Clinical Insights|Thermo Fisher Clario Acquisition]]).

Reshoring creates future CDMO opportunity—CDMO demand for small/mid biotech remains strong as 80% of FDA approvals come from smaller companies.

**Timing catalyst: MFN creates urgency NOW.** 12 of 17 targeted pharmas committed to voluntary MFN deals, locking future launches to international pricing ([[White House unveils nine new ‘most favored nation’ deals]]). Structural margin pressure forces efficiency investments—operations tooling becomes priority, not nice-to-have. Biosecure Act forces CDMO reshoring in 12-24 months, creating selection/navigation demand ([[Weakened Biosecure Act poised to become law after Senate passage]]).

**How this evolved:**
- *2025-12-20:* Cluster of 3 sources pointing at same gap: CDMO fragmentation requiring navigation, clinical supply forecasting absent for 99% of pharma, regulatory-qualified AI methods needing operational infrastructure.
- *2025-12-21:* Added MFN + Biosecure as timing catalysts. Policy creates urgency for efficiency investments and CDMO reshoring.

## Bull Case

- [x] **Massive underserved market.** Only 50 of 6,000 companies have systematic forecasting. 107,000+ biotech companies, 5,800+ startups.
  - *Evidence:* [[Jake __ Virtue]] — "Rest run on Excel, 7-10 day consultant turnaround"

- [ ] **Switching costs compound.** Once you're system of record for CDMO relationships, manufacturing schedules, supply forecasts—extremely hard to rip out.
  - *Evidence:* Needs validation — Track customer retention at Auxilius (800% ARR growth, 50+ customers)

- [ ] **AI qualification tailwind.** PROCOVA qualified (EMA 2020, FDA 2021), digital twins advancing. Infrastructure layer required but absent.
  - *Evidence:* [[Practical Considerations for Integrating AIML in Clinical Trials]] — PROCOVA validated, needs operational infrastructure

---

## Bear Case

- [ ] **Fragmented buyer.** Virtual biotechs are small, short-lived, budget-constrained. High CAC, high churn (company failures, trial completions).
  - *Evidence:* Needs validation — Analyze biotech cohort survival (2020-2022 vintage)

- [ ] **CDMO platforms disintermediate.** Lonza OneBio, Patheon integrated model could capture sponsor-side workflow.
  - *Evidence:* Needs monitoring — Track CDMO platform announcements

- [ ] **Enterprise vendors move downmarket.** Medidata, Veeva, Oracle launch "lite" versions. Brand trust + ecosystem beats point solution.
  - *Evidence:* Needs monitoring — Track Veeva/Medidata pricing tiers

## Startup Opportunities

**1. Clinical Supply Forecasting SaaS**
- Predictive algorithms (enrollment, dropout, amendments) + real-time inventory optimization
- Why this follows: Only 50 of 6,000 companies forecast. 7-10 day consultant turnaround → real-time.
- Sell to Series A-C biotechs at $50K-150K/year (affordable vs $500K+ consultants)
- Risk: AI accuracy must exceed consultant baseline to justify switch

**2. CDMO Selection Intelligence**
- NLP mining FDA/EMA inspection reports + process requirement matching
- Why this follows: 301 CDMO partnerships in 2025, fragmentation increasing, no systematic selection
- Sell to virtual biotechs selecting first CDMO partner ($50K-200K consultant replacement)
- Risk: CDMOs may build sponsor-side platforms

**3. Integrated Ops Platform**
- End-to-end: Process → CDMO matching → supply forecasting → trial logistics
- Why this follows: No current player connects these. First to integrate captures wallet share.
- Start with one wedge, expand adjacencies
- Risk: Horizontal expansion before wedge dominance

## Open Questions

**Is the virtual biotech buyer economically viable?**
→ OPEN: If customer lifetime <3 years due to churn, CAC payback impossible. Analyze 100-200 Series A biotechs (2020-2022), measure % still operating.

**Will CDMO platforms vertically integrate into sponsor workflows?**
→ OPEN: If top 10 CDMOs build sponsor-side platforms with "free" software tied to manufacturing contracts, independent layer gets disintermediated. Monitor Lonza, Patheon, WuXi announcements.

**Can AI forecasting accuracy exceed consultant baseline?**
→ OPEN: If AI doesn't beat 7-10 day consultant turnaround on accuracy, value prop collapses. Prototype AI model, backtest on 50+ completed trials, compare MAPE.
