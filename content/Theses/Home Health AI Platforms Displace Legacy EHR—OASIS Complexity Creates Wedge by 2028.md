# Thesis: Home Health AI Platforms Displace Legacy EHR — OASIS Complexity Creates Wedge by 2028

## 1-2 Sentence Summary

AI-native home health platforms displace Home Care Home Base (2003 code) because OASIS documentation complexity + messy narrative text from scanned eFaxes creates 90% coding time savings opportunity → next-gen EHR layer captures data moat for payer monetization.

## Investment Take

**Today:**

The consensus says EHR replacement is hard—Epic and legacy vendors have lock-in. The contrarian view: **home health is a greenfield opportunity because the incumbent (Home Care Home Base) is built on 2003 code and can't innovate.**

Home health agencies face unique challenges:
1. **OASIS assessments require manual data entry** from messy visit audio
2. **Scanned documents and eFaxes** contain narrative text that must map to tens of thousands of ICD-10 codes
3. **Caregiver call-outs and hospital discharges** overwhelm phone-and-spreadsheet systems
4. **QA rework** delays reimbursement

AI-native platforms attack from multiple wedges:
- **Documentation AI** (Steno Health): Auto-drafts from visit audio, flags gaps
- **Coding AI** (Olli Health): 90% time savings, transforms manual search to expert validation
- **Scheduling AI** (Zingage): 2x volume with same staff through voice AI
- **Clinical Data Analyst** (Dart Health): 80-90% of queries convert to expansion products

**The mechanism:** AI platforms capture OASIS documentation workflow because complexity creates moat → once documentation layer owned, expansion to full EHR + payer data monetization.

**In 3-5 years:**
- **Winners:** AI-native platforms that own the documentation layer and expand to full EHR (Steno, Olli). Platforms with accreditation body partnerships (Dart-CHAP).
- **Losers:** Home Care Home Base and legacy home health EHRs that can't match AI-native iteration speed.
- **Market structure:** Home health AI platforms capture $2B+ in workflow automation, with top 3 owning 60%+ of AI-enabled agencies.

## Bull Case

- [x] **Home Care Home Base can't innovate** — "Built on 2003 code... Long-term vision: Replace Home Care Home Base entirely as next-generation EHR" ([[Alex (Steno Health) __ Virtue (Sean _ Emre)]])
- [x] **90% coding time savings validated** — "Home health data looks nothing like hospital data. Instead of clean, structured formats, agencies often receive scanned documents and eFaxes... Our platform delivers up to 90% time savings" ([[2026-01-07-validated-at-ml4h-2025-how-olli-healths-proprietar]])
- [x] **2x volume with same staff** — "Agencies juggle hospital discharges, caregiver call-outs... Our team is now handling 2x the volume while feeling like they're working less" — Zingage customer ([[2026-01-08-zingage-raises-125m-to-power-the-future-of-home-ca]])
- [x] **Large agency validation** — Accent Care: 44,000 patients, can achieve company profitability from single customer ([[Alex (Steno Health) __ Virtue (Sean _ Emre)]])
- [x] **Accreditation body partnership** — CHAP deal provides enterprise distribution to all home health/hospice enterprises ([[Virtue _ Dart-2025-12-09_12-30-19]])

## Bear Case

- [ ] **Home Care Home Base fights back** — Incumbent could acquire AI capabilities or partner with AI vendors
- [ ] **Fragmented market limits scale** — Home health agencies are small and distributed, making enterprise sales expensive
- [ ] **Regulatory complexity varies by state** — State-specific OASIS requirements may fragment solutions
- [ ] **Payer pushback on AI-generated documentation** — Medicare/Medicaid auditors may increase scrutiny of AI-documented visits

**The counter-thesis:** If Home Care Home Base acquires AI capabilities or Epic expands into home health, the AI-native wedge may close before startups achieve scale. Home health remains a small, fragmented market with limited venture outcomes.

## Timeline

**Now → 2026:**
- Watch for: Large agency wins (500+ patients), accreditation body partnerships
- Entry points: AI documentation/coding platforms targeting OASIS complexity
- Zingage $12.5M raise validates scheduling AI wedge

**2027 → 2028:**
- Inflection: First AI-native platform achieves 100+ agency customers
- Critical threshold: If Home Care Home Base launches AI features, thesis weakens
- Consolidation expected as leaders acquire point solutions

**2029+:**
- AI-native EHR becomes standard for home health
- Payer data monetization unlocks secondary revenue streams
- Legacy EHR replacement cycle completes

## Startup Opportunities

**1. AI-Native Home Health EHR (Steno model)**
- Why this follows: OASIS complexity + legacy EHR creates greenfield
- Wedge: Documentation AI that reduces QA rework and accelerates reimbursement
- Risk: Fragmented market, slow enterprise sales

**2. Home Health Coding AI (Olli model)**
- Why this follows: Messy narrative text requires AI to map to ICD-10
- Wedge: 90% time savings from manual search to expert validation
- Risk: Point solution may be acquired vs. becoming platform

**3. Voice AI Scheduling (Zingage model)**
- Why this follows: Caregiver call-outs overwhelm manual processes
- Wedge: 2x volume with same staff
- Risk: May commoditize as scheduling becomes table stakes

## Watch For

**If RIGHT (thesis plays out):**
- AI-native platforms win 10+ enterprise agency contracts
- Home Care Home Base loses market share measurably
- Payer integration deals validate data monetization

**If WRONG (thesis fails):**
- Home Care Home Base launches competitive AI features
- Epic/Oracle enter home health market aggressively
- Agency consolidation reduces TAM before AI-native wins
