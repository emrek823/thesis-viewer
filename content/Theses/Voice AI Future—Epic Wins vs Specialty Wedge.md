## The Question

**What does the future of healthcare voice AI look like?**

89% of patients say they want to schedule appointments online. Only 6% actually do. That gap—between stated preference and actual behavior—determines whether voice AI becomes a durable category or gets absorbed into broader EHR platforms.

If that gap closes, standalone voice AI vendors face significant headwinds. Epic and athena bundle scheduling into their platforms, and voice becomes a feature rather than a product. The value shifts to distribution.

If that gap persists, voice AI captures the 40% of patients who still prefer phone—and the $30B in annual health system call center spend that serves them. Specialty-specific implementations (ortho, retina, dental) create switching costs that enable platform expansion into referrals, prior auth, and care navigation.

Two paths forward. The evidence points in different directions.

## Market Context

Healthcare voice AI is a $472M market today, projected to reach $11.7B by 2035 at 37.85% CAGR. Recent funding activity validates investor interest: Assort raised $102M, Tennr reached a $605M valuation, and Zocdoc launched Zo at $2/booked appointment.

The demand drivers are structural. Healthcare faces a projected 3.2M worker shortage by 2026. Call centers see 45% annual turnover. The average multi-physician practice loses $150K annually to missed calls and abandoned hold times, with new patient calls worth $300-500 in lifetime value.

The incumbents are responding aggressively. Epic controls 44% of the ambulatory market with 191M MyChart users. Epic's SMS scheduling AI books appointments in approximately 20 seconds. athenaAmbient launches free in February 2026 with intelligent scheduling included. MyChart adoption has grown from 42% in 2014 to 65% today.

The competitive dynamics remain uncertain. 95% of enterprise AI pilots fail to reach production. Only 25% of AI initiatives deliver expected ROI. The category will consolidate significantly over the next 24-36 months.

## View 1: Self-Service Gains Share—Incumbents Capture Value

The case for incumbent platforms centers on accelerating patient preference for digital and distribution advantage.

Jeremy Schwach, CEO of Hummingbird Healthcare, framed the challenge directly: "Patients want OpenTable-style online booking, not robot conversations. Real solutions existed pre-AI; the roadblocks are operational and political, not technical." The $70B invested in digital health hasn't moved online booking past 6%—but recent data suggests that's changing.

**Self-service adoption is accelerating.** Patient self-scheduling grew 30% year-over-year in 2025, with 63% of providers now offering it. When practices implement self-scheduling effectively, adoption follows. Studies show adoption jumping from 34% to 75% within a year at practices that enable it. Texas Children's processed 1M appointments via MyChart, saving $7M in staff time. WakeMed saw 75K additional visits and 21% higher outpatient revenue. 60% of online bookings occur outside office hours, suggesting 24/7 access—not human interaction—drives patient value.

**The bundling threat is materializing.** athenaAmbient launches free in February 2026 with intelligent scheduling, waitlist management, and AI-powered patient engagement included at no additional cost. Epic's Emmie enables patients to ask questions, schedule visits, and complete recommended screenings through MyChart. If EHR vendors bundle comparable voice and self-service capabilities at no incremental cost, standalone vendors face margin pressure and differentiation challenges.

**Commoditization risk is real in adjacent categories.** Menlo Ventures found 67% of ambient scribe users would consider switching vendors—customers increasingly view AI capabilities as commoditized. Gartner projects AI will replace 20-30% of call center agents by 2025, with multiple generic vendors (Hyro, Birch, Bland, Commure) competing on price. Voice scheduling could follow a similar commoditization pattern.

## View 2: Specialty Depth Creates Durable Advantage

The case for standalone voice AI centers on specialty complexity and operational lock-in.

67% of patients still prefer phone over portal messaging. Practices receive 53 calls per physician per day on average, with specialty practices seeing 50-75. This volume reflects workflow realities that self-service tools haven't addressed. The call center challenge is fundamentally a labor problem, and the labor shortage is structural.

**The lock-in evidence from operators is consistent across interviews.** At BetterNight, Tennr implementation reduced headcount from 100 admins to 5. The operations manager described the dependency directly: "My company could not untangle themselves from Tennr if we tried at this point. It would be disastrous." When asked about a hypothetical $10K/month price increase: "At this point I'd have to say yes."

Barrington Orthopedic Specialists saw abandonment rates improve from 40% to 6% after implementing Assort. Wait times dropped from 15-20 minutes to 2.5 minutes. Patient satisfaction increased from 3.4 to 3.9 out of 5. They reduced from 7 FTEs to 4—then expanded Assort to 24/7 scheduling, voicemail transcription, and clinical messaging. The CEO rated the solution "at least a 9, if not a 10."

**The specialty customization creates genuine switching costs.** One retina practice required 28-day injection spacing rules built into scheduling logic. An IT manager at Luminary Hospice noted that switching from Parakeet to Assort cut implementation from 3.5 weeks to 10 days—the difference between manual CSV exports and direct EHR integration. Even at 50% lower cost from a competitor, she indicated the customization investment would make switching difficult.

**Platform expansion is already underway.** Assort OS now handles scheduling, care navigation, prescription renewals, physician referrals, and lab test coordination. Tennr expanded from referrals to eligibility checks, benefits investigations, and prior authorization. At Annapolis Internal Medicine, 61% of flu shot appointments were booked through AI-driven outreach. The initial wedge is scheduling; the platform opportunity is patient access broadly.

## The Key Question

Both views have supporting evidence. The determining factor: **Is the 89% patient preference for online scheduling a preference gap or an implementation gap?**

If it's primarily a preference gap—patients want online booking but current tools don't deliver—then the gap narrows as Epic and athena improve self-service capabilities. The 30% YoY growth in self-service adoption and athenaAmbient's free February 2026 launch suggest this is happening. Voice AI addresses a transitional need while practices modernize their patient access infrastructure.

If it's primarily an implementation gap—operational and organizational barriers prevent effective self-service deployment—then the 40% of patients who call today continue calling for the foreseeable future. Voice AI captures that segment, builds specialty-specific switching costs, and expands into adjacent workflows.

Current evidence is mixed. $70B in digital health investment hasn't moved online booking meaningfully, and Epic integration projects typically take 6-18 months and exceed budget. Health systems move slowly. However, patient self-service adoption is accelerating (30% YoY), and EHR vendors are bundling competitive capabilities at no incremental cost. The operational foundation for effective self-service is improving faster than it was 24 months ago.

## Open Questions

**1. What is the trajectory of patient self-service adoption?**
Current baseline is 6%, growing 30% YoY. If adoption reaches 30% by 2027, the addressable market for voice AI narrows considerably. If it remains below 20%, the phone-first segment stays large.

**2. Can Zocdoc or Epic replicate specialty depth?**
Zocdoc launched Zo at $2/booked appointment with 70% resolution—but without specialty-specific rules like 28-day injection spacing or ortho body-part routing. Whether they invest in that complexity determines how defensible the specialty moat remains.

**3. Does platform expansion drive retention and expansion revenue?**
Assort and Tennr are moving into referrals and prior auth. If customers adopt these additional modules, NRR should exceed 130% and create meaningful switching costs. If expansion stalls, the companies remain scheduling point solutions.

**4. How should we interpret the 95% AI pilot failure rate?**
Most failures stem from inadequate operational preparation rather than technology limitations. Practices that invest in proper implementation see strong results (40%→6% abandonment). The question is whether enough practices will do this work to support a large market.

**5. Where does Epic focus its AI investment?**
Epic is running 200+ AI pilots, but current focus appears to be ambient documentation—a physician workflow problem. Scheduling is a call center problem with different buyers and priorities. If Epic shifts focus to patient-facing AI, standalone vendors face more direct competition.

## Research Priorities

- **Self-service adoption trends** at practices with Epic/athena online scheduling. Is usage growing, plateauing, or declining? The 30% YoY figure needs practice-level validation.

- **Churn data** from voice AI vendors. The lock-in thesis requires logo churn below 5%. Higher churn would indicate weaker switching costs than operator quotes suggest.

- **Platform expansion attach rates** at Assort and Tennr. What percentage of scheduling customers add referrals, prior auth, or prescription refill modules?

- **Epic 2026 roadmap details.** Is specialty-specific scheduling on the product roadmap, or does AI investment remain focused on clinical documentation?

- **Zocdoc Zo competitive positioning.** Are they pursuing specialty customization? Have they won DSO or large specialty group contracts? Blue Shield partnership scope.

- **athenaAmbient adoption post-February 2026.** How quickly do athena customers adopt the free scheduling AI? Does it reduce voice AI vendor pipeline?

## Current Assessment

**Base case (50% probability):** Voice AI establishes durable position in specialty segments, expands to platform. Market bifurcates—generic scheduling faces commoditization pressure from Epic/Zocdoc, while specialty voice retains pricing power through switching costs.

**Bear case (30% probability):** Patient self-service adoption accelerates meaningfully. EHR vendors bundle competitive capabilities. Standalone voice AI vendors face consolidation pressure or pivot to services. The 30% YoY self-service growth and free athenaAmbient launch support this scenario more than 6 months ago.

**Bull case (20% probability):** Both channels grow—self-service captures digitally-native patients, voice AI captures phone-preference segment. Market expands rather than substitutes.

Evidence currently favors the specialty wedge thesis based on operator interviews and lock-in indicators. However, the preference vs. implementation question could shift the outlook materially. Contrarian evidence (self-service adoption accelerating, athenaAmbient free, 67% would switch scribes) has increased the probability of the bear case from 25% to 30%.

Key monitoring metric: self-service adoption rate. Movement above 30% by 2027 would warrant reassessment.
