## The Take

**Lead with opportunity:** $100B TAM in proteomics diagnostics with only 5-10% current penetration. Thermo paid $3.1B for Olink (40-50% market share). Illumina acquiring SomaLogic for $425M. UK Biobank just selected Olink for 600,000-sample study. Regeneron selected Olink for 200,000-sample study. The genomics giants are buying their way into proteomics because they see what the market is missing.

**Mechanism:** Proteins change constantly (weekly, monthly, yearly) while DNA is sequenced once. This creates fundamentally different business models: proteomics generates recurring revenue through longitudinal monitoring, genomics generates transactional revenue from one-time tests. Quanterix demonstrates this with 80% recurring revenue from consumables/reagents despite facing significant market headwinds. The superior business model attracts strategic acquirers who face commoditization pressure in genomics.

**Outcome:** By 2028, major proteomics platforms (Olink, SomaLogic, Alamar) will be integrated into genomics giants as business units. Winners are recurring-revenue diagnostics companies and AI companies with proprietary multi-property datasets. Losers are pure-play AI model companies without molecules and mass spec platforms that stay research-only.

## Investment Take

**Today:** Consensus believes genomics companies (Illumina, Thermo Fisher) own diagnostic infrastructure permanently. Proteomics is research-only, fragmented across incompatible platforms. AI protein foundation models are the next platform bet.

Actually: DNA is once-and-done. You sequence once, and medical utility is mostly limited to cancer applications. Proteins change constantly, creating recurring testing at tens of dollars per sample. The business model difference is stark: Quanterix runs 80% recurring revenue while genomics companies face commoditization pressure. Genomics giants already see this: Thermo paid $3.1B for Olink, Illumina is acquiring SomaLogic for $425M (closing H1 2026). They are becoming acquirers, not builders, in proteomics.

The near-term picture is challenging. Quanterix revenue dropped 29% YoY in Q2 2025, stock down 62% in six months. NIH funding cuts hit 22% of revenue. Mass spec costs are falling faster than expected ("$10 proteome" research achieved). But these are market headwinds, not mechanism failures. The UK Biobank Pharma Proteomics Project selected Olink to analyze 5,400 proteins from 600,000 samples starting Q1 2025. Regeneron selected Olink for 200,000 patient samples. Institutional adoption validates the platform, even as commercial customers face funding pressure.

The AI protein design angle is real but the moat is misunderstood. Models commoditize: Boltz-2 (open-source, MIT/Recursion) achieves ~0.6 correlation with experimental binding data in seconds vs. 6-12 hours for traditional FEP calculations. The gap between private and open-source models has "effectively vanished" per industry observers. But multi-property optimization datasets (expression, stability, immunogenicity, PK/PD) remain scarce: <1,000 antibodies for non-binding properties vs. millions for binding. Preclinical developability costs range $100K-$27M per compound. Chai's 86% developability rate shows AI can solve this, but requires proprietary data. The moat is molecules and datasets, not models.

**In 3-5 years:** Proteomics diagnostics become standard of care for chronic disease monitoring. Longitudinal plasma proteomics predicted 40+ health endpoints better than established clinical indicators. Organ age estimates from 2,916 proteins associated with future onset (within 17 years) of heart failure, COPD, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer's. First RCT-level clinical utility data emerges by 2027-2028. Genomics companies fully acquire or partner with remaining proteomics platforms. Winners: recurring-revenue diagnostics with proven clinical utility. Losers: pure-play AI model companies, mass spec platforms that stay research-only, proteomics companies that fail to achieve reimbursement.

**How this evolved:**
- *2025-12-12:* [[Alex __ Emre]] — Operator insight: proteins change constantly = recurring tests. OLink $3B validates market. $100B TAM, 5-10% penetration.
- *2025-12-23:* AI protein foundation models raised $1B+ but business model unclear. EvolutionaryScale collapse proves models alone don't justify valuations.
- *2025-12-29:* REBUILD v3. 14 sources verified. Core thesis holds: proteomics = recurring revenue vs genomics once-and-done.
- *2026-01-26:* **REBUILD v4.** Contrarian threats: Quanterix down 29% YoY, mass spec approaching "$10 proteome", open-source AI models catching private. But M&A validation continues (Illumina-SomaLogic H1 2026), UK Biobank/Regeneron institutional adoption validates platform. Thesis weakened but mechanism intact.

## Bull Case

- [x] **Recurring revenue model proven.** Quanterix: 80% recurring revenue through consumables/reagents, 7 consecutive quarters double-digit growth. ([[Quanterix Q3 2025 earnings - 80% recurring revenue]])

- [x] **Strategic M&A validates market at scale.** Thermo paid $3.1B for Olink (40-50% market share, July 2024). Illumina acquiring SomaLogic for $425M (closing H1 2026). Abbott acquired Exact Sciences. Pattern: genomics giants buying proteomics capabilities. ([[Thermo Fisher acquires Olink for $3.1B]], [[Illumina to acquire SomaLogic for $425M]])

- [x] **Institutional adoption at unprecedented scale.** UK Biobank Pharma Proteomics Project selected Olink for 5,400 proteins from 600,000 samples (Q1 2025 start, data releases 2026-2027). Regeneron selected Olink for 200,000 patient samples. Validates platform for population-scale research.

- [x] **Sensitivity breakthroughs enabling new clinical use cases.** Alamar NULISA: 10,000-fold signal-to-noise improvement, attomolar detection (10-100x vs Olink/SomaLogic). Unlocks low-abundance proteins previously undetectable. ([[Alamar Biosciences raises $128M Series C for NULISA proteomics]])

- [x] **AI hit rates exceed traditional methods.** Chai-2: 16% de novo antibody hit rate (vs <1% traditional), 86% developability, <2 weeks AI-to-validation. ([[Chai Discovery unveils Chai-2 with 86% developability and 16% hit rate]], [[2025-12-23-neurips-2025-biologys-transformer-moment]])

- [ ] **Reimbursement path emerging.** PromarkerD received $390.75 Medicare PLA code. Quanterix LucentAD expects ~$897 Medicare pricing. But general proteomics still faces MolDX complexity and 90%+ validation failure rates.

---

## Bear Case

- [x] **Poster child struggling significantly.** Quanterix revenue down 29% YoY Q2 2025, stock down 62% in 6 months. NIH funding cuts affecting 22% of revenue. Akoya integration adding complexity and costs. Path to cash flow breakeven pushed to 2026. ([[Quanterix Q2 2025 earnings - 29% decline]])

- [x] **Mass spec costs declining faster than expected.** "$10 proteome" research achieved with Orbitrap Astral and timsTOF Ultra 2. Mean proteomics test cost ~$897/patient but falling. LC-MS/MS at $250/sample academic, $100/injection for targeted panels. Could erode affinity platform advantage.

- [x] **AI protein models commoditizing.** Boltz-2 (open-source) achieves ~0.6 correlation with experimental binding in seconds vs. 6-12 hours FEP at ~$100/simulation. Gap between private/open "effectively vanished." EvolutionaryScale ($142M seed) folded into Zuckerberg nonprofit 2025. ([[Models are out, molecules are in as AI startups sprint to clinic]])

- [ ] **Reimbursement remains challenging.** MolDX requires Technical Assessment, Z-Codes for billing, panels with 15+ targets face denials. CPT 87801 reimburses ~$75 (below actual cost). 90%+ validation failure rates for discovery biomarkers.

- [ ] **Technology fragmentation persists.** Multiple platforms (mass spec, antibody, aptamer) with no standard. Cross-platform reproducibility broken. OSPP (Charite Open Standard for Plasma Proteomics) released 2025 but adoption unclear.

- [ ] **Clinical adoption slow.** Physicians trained on genomics/chemistry panels. Mass spec requires PhD operators. No one knows what to do with 11,000 protein values. Need AI-based clinical decision support.

- [ ] **AI protein patents may not provide moat.** ProteinMPNN generates functional variants at 40% sequence identity—below any patent threshold. CDR-level antibody patents vulnerable to mutation scanning. ([[2025-12-23-boolean-biotech]])

## The Counter Thesis

For this thesis to be wrong:

1. **Genomics becomes recurring.** Polygenic risk scores gain broad reimbursement for wellness/prevention applications. Pharmacogenomics requires retesting. DNA becomes a longitudinal biomarker like proteins. ESC endorsed PRS in 2025, Allelica got CLIA number. But 23andMe bankruptcy shows consumer genomics struggling. The once-and-done problem is structural to DNA stability.

2. **Mass spec achieves clinical parity.** Costs fall below $100/sample with <2 hours hands-on time and automated interpretation. Affinity platform sensitivity advantage disappears. The "$10 proteome" research exists but requires Orbitrap Astral or timsTOF Ultra 2 instruments—still far from clinical workflow integration.

3. **Proteomics reimbursement stays broken.** MolDX denials continue, no tests achieve >$100 Medicare pricing at scale, validation failure rates stay >90%. Business model breaks despite recurring consumption. Quanterix struggles in 2025 show this is a real risk. Counter-argument: Thermo's $3.1B and Illumina's $425M wouldn't deploy if payers stay blocked.

4. **Pharma in-houses AI protein capabilities.** Major pharma builds internal AI protein design, stops licensing from startups. Molecules > models means pharma captures all value. But clinical development expertise still matters—AI companies moving to clinic (21 programs by end 2026) may capture value through molecules not tools.

## Timeline

**Now - 2026:** Illumina-SomaLogic closes H1 2026. UK Biobank data releases begin 2026. Watch: Quanterix LucentAD achieving meaningful revenue ($50M+ annually would validate proteomics reimbursement). Sedona entering market with at-home multi-omic testing at $500 (vs $5K competitors). Entry point: diagnostics companies with proven recurring revenue surviving the NIH funding crunch.

**2027 - 2028:** First major proteomics clinical utility data (RCT-level evidence for outcomes). Standardization consortia form or FDA mandates cross-platform validation. AI protein companies show clinical proof-of-concept (21 programs in clinic by end 2026, expect Phase 2 readouts 2027-2028). Key threshold: >$500M revenue proteomics pure-play with >70% recurring.

**2029+:** Proteomics becomes standard in chronic disease management pathways (Alzheimer's monitoring, metabolic syndrome, oncology surveillance). Genomics giants operate proteomics as business units. AI protein winners are those with proprietary multi-property datasets and clinical-stage molecules. Market structure: 2-3 dominant clinical platforms (like Illumina in genomics), dozens of specialized panels.

## Startup Opportunities

**1. Disease-Specific Recurring Proteomics Diagnostics**
- Why this follows: Proteins change = recurring tests = superior LTV. Quanterix proves model with Alzheimer's (LucentAD at $897). Indication-specific reimbursement path clearer than broad panels.
- Wedge: Start with single chronic disease (diabetic kidney disease, heart failure, autoimmune) where longitudinal monitoring has clear clinical utility. Partner with health systems for outcomes data. Target CCRC/longevity clinics like Sedona doing.
- Risk: Reimbursement uncertainty. Requires clinical validation ($10M+). Platform vendors may launch competing panels. NIH funding cuts reduce academic customers.

**2. Proteomics Standardization & QC Platform**
- Why this follows: Benzon Foundation identified standardization as #1 barrier. 90%+ validation failure rates. OSPP released but needs commercial implementation.
- Wedge: QC reagents + reference standards for clinical trials. Software for cross-platform data normalization. Position as neutral arbiter.
- Risk: Platform vendors resist third-party standardization. May require regulatory mandate to create demand.

**3. Multi-Property Protein Optimization Platform (Beyond Binding)**
- Why this follows: Binding commoditized (Boltz-2 solves in seconds). Preclinical developability datasets small (<1,000 antibodies) but costs $100K-$27M per compound. Chai's 86% developability shows AI can solve this.
- Wedge: Generate proprietary multi-property datasets (expression, stability, immunogenicity, PK/PD) through high-throughput screening like RamaX. License per-design or take success fees. RESP2 shows 85%+ success rate vs 1.5% for other generative AI.
- Risk: Open-source may catch up. Pharma may in-house. Patent protection unclear.

**4. AI Clinical Decision Support for Proteomics**
- Why this follows: Physicians can't interpret 11,000 protein values. Need explainable AI that reduces to top 10 actionable insights with evidence links.
- Wedge: Start with research-to-clinical translation for pharma (biomarker selection). Expand to health system clinical decision support.
- Risk: Platform vendors build in-house. Liability concerns. Regulatory pathway unclear for AI interpretation.

## Watch For

**If RIGHT (thesis plays out):**
- Quanterix LucentAD achieves >$50M annual revenue by end 2026 (validates proteomics reimbursement at scale)
- Another major proteomics M&A >$1B (signals continued strategic value recognition)
- UK Biobank/Regeneron proteomics data release shows clinical utility discoveries (2026-2027)
- Chai or similar shows clinical-stage molecule with AI-optimized multi-property profile
- Mass spec fails to achieve <$100/sample with <2hrs hands-on in clinical settings by 2027

**If WRONG (thesis fails):**
- Quanterix fails to reach cash flow breakeven by 2027, requires restructuring
- Genomics polygenic risk scores gain broad Medicare reimbursement (DNA becomes recurring)
- Proteomics reimbursement stays stuck at <$100 per test outside specialty applications
- Open-source AI protein models achieve comparable multi-property optimization (dataset moat disappears)
- Major pharma builds in-house AI protein capabilities, stops licensing from startups

*Confidence: MEDIUM — Mechanism intact (proteins recurring, genomics once-and-done) but near-term execution challenged. Quanterix struggles, mass spec cost declines, and reimbursement complexity create 2-3 year uncertainty. M&A validation and institutional adoption (UK Biobank, Regeneron) confirm strategic value.*
*Last rebuilt: 2026-01-26*
*Contrarian threats: Quanterix down 29% YoY with stock -62%, mass spec approaching "$10 proteome", open-source AI models catching private. Addressed: market headwinds not mechanism failure; M&A continues; institutional adoption validates platform.*
