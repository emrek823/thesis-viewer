## The Take

**$9B payment integrity market shifting from 70/30 post-pay to 30/70 pre-pay by 2030.** 72% of payers investing upstream; post-pay recovers only $0.40 per $1 after vendor fees. Cloud CAPS captures mid-market while UNH/Elevance stay in-house. Enablement economics (1-2% OpEx vs 10-12%) crush payer-owned VBC as OptumHealth margins collapse from 5% to 1%.

**Mechanism:** [Pre-pay AI platforms + cloud CAPS vendors] capture [mid-market payers] because [post-pay economics are broken (3% success rate) + integration complexity creates lock-in + homegrown systems are too expensive for mid-market] → [asset-light, technology-first approaches dominate by 2028].

---

## Investment Take

**Today:** The consensus says payer infrastructure is mature and sticky. Payment integrity is dominated by incumbents (Cotiviti, Optum) with post-pay recovery working fine. Core admin systems won't change.

**Actually:** Three structural shifts are inverting payer economics:

1. **Payment Integrity:** Post-pay is economically broken—3% success rate, $0.40 realized per $1 after vendor fees, 70% false positive rate. Pre-pay went from "virtually nonexistent" 10 years ago to 40% today. 72% of payers are moving upstream. But KLAS 2025 reports: "Cotiviti & Optum Have Broadest Portfolios, Though Customers Say Value Is Diminished by Gaps in Support & Service Quality."

2. **Core Admin:** Cloud migration is real but bifurcated. Top 2-3 payers (UNH, Elevance) are "too proud" to abandon homegrown—120M+ lives off the table. But mid-market has "half still to go." HealthEdge's advantage is all-or-nothing cloud integration. 80% of payers expect to increase cloud investments.

3. **Care Delivery Model:** Payer-owned VBC structurally fails. OptumHealth VBC margin collapsed 80% (5% → 1% in two years). Optum strategy "strayed from initial intent"—network too large, misaligned physicians. V28 is $11B cumulative headwind. Enablement (Pearl, Vytalize, Aledade) operates at 1-2% OpEx vs 10-12% for payer-owned clinics.

**The connection:** Pre-pay requires "deep integration with core claims infrastructure." Enablement requires data + workflow integration with payers. Both shifts favor asset-light, technology-first approaches over vertical ownership.

**In 5-10 years:**
- **Winners:** AI-native pre-pay platforms (Machinify, Codoxo); claims editing content leaders (Optum/Lyric for national payers); HealthEdge (mid-market CAPS); asset-light physician enablers (Pearl, Vytalize, Aledade)
- **Losers:** Post-pay recovery vendors (Rawlings/Phia Group as standalone); CAPS vendors without content strategy; legacy on-prem without cloud paths; payer-owned clinic chains (OptumHealth)

**How this evolved:**
- *2026-01-26:* **REBUILD** — Contrarian testing: KLAS confirms Cotiviti/Optum service quality gaps. OptumHealth "strayed from model" with network too large. Post-pay still has role but declining. VBC enablers (Vytalize) showing profitability while agilon/Privia stocks down 94%/46%.
- *2026-01-04:* MERGED Payer Enablers thesis
- *2025-12-29:* REBUILD v2 with content moat nuance

## Mechanism

### Payment Integrity: Pre-Pay Beats Post-Pay

**Why post-pay fails:**
- Only 3% of flagged claims result in successful recovery (100K flagged -> 3,150 recovered)
- 70% false positive rate wastes 210,000 analyst hours annually at UHG alone ($7M+ in labor)
- Post-pay vendors charge 25-35% of recoveries, so payers only recoup ~$0.40 of every $1
- KLAS 2025: "Inconsistent Follow-Through a Challenge for Conduent, Cotiviti, EXL & Optum"

**Why pre-pay wins:**
- Catches 70-80% of payment errors upfront (vs. 30% post-pay)
- 72% of payers are moving upstream, investing in tech that catches errors before they impact the payment cycle
- Pre-pay market grew from "virtually nonexistent" to 40% in 10 years; heading to 60%+ by 2030
- AI-native platforms (Machinify) achieving 60%+ audit hit rate vs 25-30% status quo

### Core Admin: Cloud + Content Moat

**Why cloud wins:**
- "The amount of excess capacity that had to be purchased and maintained to handle surges goes away"
- All-or-nothing migration creates urgency: partial migration "doesn't fix anything"
- 80% of payers expect to increase cloud investments (~30% spend increase)

**The content moat:** Claims editing content is the real differentiator—$100M+ annual savings gap between Optum/Lyric (130+ knowledge packs) and HealthEdge/Burgess (13). Pre-pay requires deep integration with core claims infrastructure.

### Care Delivery: Enablement Beats Ownership

**Why payer-owned VBC fails:**
- OptumHealth VBC margins: 5% (2023) → 3% (2024) → 1% (2025) — 80% collapse
- Optum CEO: strategy "strayed from initial intent"—oversized network, operational inconsistencies
- New patient cohorts structurally unprofitable: pre-2022 at 8%+, 2022/2023 at 2%, 2024/2025 negative
- V28 is $11B cumulative headwind (2024-2026)

**Why enablement wins:**
- Payer-owned: 10-12% OpEx, employed physicians, real estate, regulatory capital
- Enablement: 1-2% OpEx, independent physicians, no real estate, 1/20th regulatory capital
- Vytalize: profitable, 8% cost savings, #1 on Inc. 5000 with $1.5B revenue and 90,778% growth
- "We will run out of high-quality PCPs before we run out of members" — Humana VP

## Bull Case

### Payment Integrity
- [x] **72% of payers moving upstream to pre-pay:** Industry shift validated by multiple sources
- [x] **Post-pay economics broken:** 3% success rate, $0.40 per $1 after vendor fees, 70% false positive rate
- [x] **Pre-pay at 40% and growing:** Up from "virtually nonexistent" 10 years ago; 60%+ by 2030

## Bear Case

### 1. Pre-Pay Provider Abrasion (MEDIUM RISK)
- KLAS: "Across Vendors, Post-Payment Clients Call for Better Reporting & Real-Time Analytics"
- Provider complaints: "I was told I was being kicked out of the network for refusing to bill claims due to the financial hardship created by the prepayment audit"
- Optum pre-pay put providers on review for "almost every individual claim submitted"
- **Implication:** Pre-pay adoption may slow if provider pushback intensifies

### 2. Content Moat Protects Incumbents (HIGH RISK)
- Optum/Lyric: 130+ knowledge packs vs 13 at HealthEdge/Burgess
- "$100M+ annual savings gap" takes years to close
- "Editors are more based on the content than they are the system performance"
- **Implication:** AI-native startups may struggle to match content depth

### 3. Top Payers Build In-House (HIGH RISK — CONFIRMED)
- "United and Elevance Carelon are too proud to stop using homegrown systems" — 120M+ lives off table
- Implementation costs = "one to one-and-a-half years of license fees"
- TriZetto can defend with 15% price cut
- **Implication:** TAM ceiling for CAPS vendors is mid-market only

### 4. VBC Enablement Stocks Collapsed (MEDIUM RISK)
- agilon stock down 94% from 2021 IPO
- Privia stock down 46% from 2021 IPO
- "Wall Street has increasingly questioned the VBC enablement play"
- **Counter:** Vytalize is profitable; stock crashes may reflect public market sentiment, not model fundamentals

### 5. 2026 Rate Increase May Provide Relief (LOW RISK)
- 5.1% rate increase for 2026 vs 2.2% proposed; $30B more in taxpayer money
- If CMS meaningfully raises MA rates or relaxes V28, integrated models could recover

---

## The Counter Thesis

**The strongest counter-argument is that content moat protects incumbents.** Optum/Lyric's 130+ knowledge packs vs 13 at HealthEdge represents years of accumulated payer policy knowledge. AI-native startups may iterate faster on algorithms but lack the clinical rules engine depth.

**For VBC enablement:** If CMS raises MA rates >5% annually or relaxes V28, integrated models could recover margins. If OptumHealth's 2024/2025 cohorts mature to positive margins by 2027-2028, the structural failure thesis is wrong—it was timing, not fundamentals.

**For this thesis to be wrong:** (1) Post-pay vendors successfully add AI pre-pay capabilities and maintain market share, OR (2) Claims editing content becomes commoditized (open-source knowledge packs), OR (3) OptumHealth executes turnaround and returns to 3%+ VBC margins by 2027.

---

## Timeline

**Now - 2026:**
- Market shift accelerates: 70/30 post-pay → 50/50 split
- Rawlings-Machinify and Cotiviti-Edifecs integrations play out
- Mid-tier payers adopt startup pre-pay solutions
- OptumHealth continues network contraction; watch for margin improvement
- 76% of health systems increase VBC participation

**2027 - 2028:**
- Pre-pay becomes standard infrastructure for top-20 payers
- Post-pay market compresses measurably
- First major commercial CAPS migration completes (3M+ lives)
- VBC enablement consolidation: acquisitions of Pearl/Vytalize/Aledade likely

**2029+:**
- 30/70 post-pay/pre-pay market structure
- Cloud becomes default for mid-market payers
- Market structure: UNH/Elevance in-house, HealthEdge mid-market, AI-native pre-pay across segments

---

## Startup Opportunities

### 1. Provider-Side Pre-Submit Accuracy
**Why:** Denial rates reduced from 13% to 3% with pre-submit review
**Wedge:** High-volume ambulatory/outpatient providers with 20,000+ claims/year
**Risk:** Epic/Cerner build native; payer pre-pay catches same errors downstream

### 2. Mid-Tier Payer Pre-Pay Platform
**Why:** "Cotiviti doesn't have the good solution for mid-tier"
**Wedge:** Regional Blues, Medicaid MCOs, smaller MA plans that can't afford $25-40M Cotiviti contracts
**Risk:** Large vendors move downmarket; limited deal size caps growth

### 3. Claims Editing Content Platform
**Why:** "$100M+ annual savings gap" between leaders and laggards
**Wedge:** Build specialty-specific knowledge packs that HealthEdge and others integrate
**Risk:** Optum/Lyric's 130+ pack moat requires massive investment to close

### 4. VBC Enablement Infrastructure
**Why:** 76% of health systems increasing VBC; enablement economics crush payer-owned
**Wedge:** Infrastructure layer (data, analytics, care management) for enablers
**Risk:** VBC enablers may build vs buy; agilon/Privia stock collapse affects funding environment

## Watch For

### Signals This Thesis is RIGHT:
- Rawlings or Phia Group revenue declines 10%+ YoY
- Cotiviti pre-pay revenue grows faster than post-pay
- HealthEdge announces 3+ Medicaid wins in different states
- OptumHealth announces further network contraction or divestitures
- Vytalize/Aledade raises growth round at $1B+ valuation

### Signals This Thesis is WRONG:
- Post-pay vendors maintain revenue growth through volume
- Pre-pay false positive rates remain >50%, causing provider backlash
- UNH/Elevance successfully migrate homegrown to cloud without vended CAPS
- OptumHealth VBC margins return to 3%+ by 2027
- agilon/Privia recover significantly, validating integrated VBC model
