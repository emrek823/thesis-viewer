# Payer Infrastructure Modernizes—Pre-Pay AI and Cloud CAPS Capture Mid-Market by 2028

## Investment Take

**Consensus believes:** Payer infrastructure is mature and sticky. Payment integrity is dominated by incumbents (Cotiviti, Optum) with post-pay recovery working fine. Core admin systems (CAPS) won't change—UNH and Elevance built homegrown and will maintain forever. AI is incremental improvement.

**Actually:** Three structural shifts are inverting payer economics, but the competitive moats differ by segment:

1. **Payment Integrity:** Post-pay is economically broken—3% success rate, $0.40 realized per $1 after vendor fees. Pre-pay went from "virtually nonexistent" 10 years ago to 40% today, heading to 60%+ by 2030. **But the real moat isn't AI—it's claims editing content.** Optum and Lyric have 130+ knowledge packs built over decades; HealthEdge's Burgess has 13. This "$100M+ annual savings gap" between leaders and laggards takes years to close.

2. **Core Admin:** Cloud migration is real but bifurcated. The top 2-3 payers (UNH, Elevance) are "too proud" to abandon homegrown—that's 120M+ lives off the table. But "half the market is still to go" in the mid-market. HealthEdge's advantage is all-or-nothing cloud integration—partial migration "doesn't fix anything."

3. **Care Delivery Model:** Payer-owned VBC structurally fails. OptumHealth's VBC margin collapse (5% → 1% in two years) is the proof point. V28 is $11B cumulative headwind (structural, not cyclical). New patient cohorts permanently unprofitable. Asset-light physician enablement (Pearl, Vytalize, Aledade) operates at 1-2% OpEx vs 10-12% for payer-owned clinics—10x capital efficiency advantage.

The connection: Pre-pay requires "deep integration with core claims infrastructure." Enablement requires data + workflow integration with payers. Both shifts favor asset-light, technology-first approaches over vertical ownership. Mid-market payers who adopt cloud CAPS + pre-pay vendors + enablement partnerships outperform integrated giants.

**In 5-10 years:**
- **Winners:** AI-native pre-pay platforms (Machinify, Apixio, Codoxo); claims editing content leaders (Optum/Lyric for national payers); HealthEdge (mid-market CAPS); asset-light physician enablers (Pearl, Vytalize, Aledade)
- **Losers:** Post-pay recovery vendors (Rawlings, Phia Group); CAPS vendors without content strategy; legacy on-prem without cloud paths; payer-owned clinic chains (OptumHealth); employed-physician models

**How this evolved:**
- **Dec 2025 (Payment Integrity):** Expert interviews confirmed 18-year UHG veteran: "in the last five years, it's the complete opposite shift, now it's all pre-pay." Rawlings acquired Machinify for pre-pay AI. Cotiviti acquired Edifecs for upstream EDI positioning.
- **Dec 2025 (Core Admin):** [[tegus_healthedge_124120_vice-president-of-emerging-products--af4fb519]] — "Half the market still to go. Centene, Humana, Cigna will give up homegrown systems."
- **2025-12-29:** Merged Payment Integrity and Payer Core Admin theses—same infrastructure modernization wave, interconnected moats.
- **2026-01-02:** **REBUILD v2** — Added content moat nuance. Optum/Lyric's 130 knowledge packs vs Burgess's 13 is harder to close than thesis assumed. Confirmed more bear case items based on clinical data access fragmentation.
- **2026-01-04:** **MERGED** "Payer Enablers Capture Value as VBC Model Fails" — Added care delivery model as third mechanism. OptumHealth VBC collapse (5%→1% margin) + V28 headwinds + enablement economics unified under "asset-light beats ownership" theme.

## Mechanism

### Payment Integrity: Pre-Pay Beats Post-Pay

**Why post-pay fails:**
- Only 3% of flagged claims result in successful recovery (100K flagged -> 3,150 recovered)
- 70% false positive rate wastes 210,000 analyst hours annually at UHG alone ($7M+ in labor)
- 18-24 month average recovery timeline with time decay reducing collection success
- Post-pay vendors charge 25-35% of recoveries, so payers only recoup ~$0.40 of every $1

**Why pre-pay wins:**
- Catches 70-80% of payment errors upfront (vs. 30% post-pay)
- Real-time intervention within 14-day window while member engagement is high
- Response rates improve from 35% to 60-65% with digital-first outreach
- Prevents initial payout entirely rather than chasing recoupment
- "If you had 80% implementation successful pre-pay scenario in five years, you could shrink subrogation by 60% in volume"

### Core Admin: Cloud + Content Moat

**Why cloud wins:**
- "The amount of excess capacity that had to be purchased and maintained to handle surges goes away." Flexible storage, smaller footprint.
- All-or-nothing migration creates urgency: "What did you really fix? You still have latency issues."
- HealthEdge has integration advantage: "All their applications are designed to connect that way."

**The integration moat:** Pre-pay requires "deep integration with core claims infrastructure" (CAPS systems like HealthEdge, Facets, TriZetto). ClaimsXten dominates on Facets/QNXT because tight integration matters. Claims editing content is the real differentiator—$100M+ annual savings gap between leaders and laggards.

### Care Delivery: Enablement Beats Ownership

**Why payer-owned VBC fails:**
- OptumHealth VBC margins: 5% (2023) → 3% (2024) → 1% (2025) — 80% collapse in two years
- FFS practices generating "hundreds of millions of losses" in 2025
- New patient cohorts permanently unprofitable: pre-2022 at 8%+, 2022/2023 at 2%, 2024/2025 negative
- V28 is $11B cumulative headwind (2024-2026), $2B worse than original estimates

**Why enablement wins:**
- Payer-owned: 10-12% OpEx, employed physicians, real estate, regulatory capital
- Enablement: 1-2% OpEx, independent physicians, no real estate, 1/20th regulatory capital
- Enablement triples PCP revenue without capital investment; Vytalize takes 40% cut of 3x revenue
- "We will run out of high-quality PCPs before we run out of members" — Humana VP

## Bull Case

### Payment Integrity
- [x] **70% of major payers now focus on upstream pre-pay:** Confirmed by UHG expert with 18 years experience
- [x] **Post-pay economics are broken:** 3% success rate, $0.40 per $1 after vendor fees (Cigna VP). 70% false positive rate wastes 210K analyst hours at UHG alone.
- [x] **Pre-pay already at 40% of PI market:** Up from "virtually nonexistent" 10 years ago (ETK). Trajectory: 50/50 by 2026, 60%+ by 2030.
- [x] **Rawlings acquiring Machinify validates shift:** Traditional post-pay leader buying AI pre-pay capabilities
- [x] **Cotiviti-Edifecs creates upstream positioning:** Moving revenue model "from right to left" per Cigna expert. NLP reduces false positives ~40%.
- [ ] **Post-pay market compresses 60%+ by 2030:** "shrink subrogation by 60% in volume" (Optum TPM)
- [ ] **EMR access hits 60-70% in 3-5 years:** Currently fragmented; enables clinical+administrative data fusion

### Core Admin
- [x] **60-65% of lives on vended CAPS:** HealthEdge + TriZetto (Elevance expert)
- [x] **Mid-market will migrate:** "Centene, Humana, Cigna will give up homegrown systems." (Lyric VP)
- [ ] **All-or-nothing cloud creates urgency:** "What did you really fix?" with partial migration
- [ ] **HealthEdge wins Medicaid beachhead:** Single-state deals avoid cross-border complexity

### Care Delivery / Enablement
- [x] **OptumHealth VBC margins collapsed 80% in two years (5% to 1%)** — Largest integrated risk-bearer proves model economics are broken ([[unh-2q25-follow-up_-a-resetting-of-process-financials-and-t-9c3c18d4]])
- [x] **V28 risk adjustment is $11B cumulative headwind (2024-2026)** — $2B worse than original estimates; structural not cyclical
- [x] **Enablement operates at 10x lower OpEx (1-2% vs 10-12%)** — Capital efficiency advantage is structural, not operational ([[pearl-health---july-2022-overview-564fe9d4]])
- [x] **Enablement triples PCP revenue without capital investment** — Vytalize takes 40% cut of 3x revenue; PCPs prefer this to employment ([[vytalize-intro-deck_12420_vs-66b3ef2e]])
- [x] **New patient cohorts structurally unprofitable** — Pre-2022 at 8%+ margin, 2022/2023 at 2%, 2024/2025 negative
- [x] **MA plans cutting supplemental benefits for first time ever ($6 PMPM decline)** — Margin pressure reaching member experience ([[2025-12-23-state-of-the-2025-medicare-advantage-industry-gene]])
- [ ] **Pearl/Vytalize/Aledade reaches 500K+ attributed lives each** — Scale threshold for enablement model

---

## Bear Case

### Payment Integrity
- [x] **Claims editing content is the REAL moat:** Optum/Lyric have 130 knowledge packs vs 13 at Burgess. "$100M+ annual savings gap" takes years to close. "Editors are more based on the content than they are the system performance." ([[tegus_healthedge_124120]])
- [ ] **Payers build internally, vendors commoditize:** Large payers have data advantage for custom algorithms
- [ ] **Provider abrasion limits adoption:** Pre-pay "comes with member experience potential friction, can lead to care delays"
- [x] **Clinical data access remains fragmented:** "Most health plans still do not have 100% connectivity for EMR data...at best 60-70%" (Cigna VP)
- [x] **Contract data is sacred:** "Plans consider that very sensitive information because it dictates their MLR" (Cigna VP)

### Core Admin
- [x] **Top 2-3 payers will build in-house:** "United and Elevance Carelon are too proud to say, 'We're going to stop using our homegrown system.'" — 120M+ lives off the table
- [x] **Migration costs are high:** "Implementation cost is going to be equal to one or one and a half years of your license fees."
- [x] **TriZetto can defend incumbents:** 15% price cut can offset migration risk.

### Care Delivery / Enablement
- [ ] **Patient cohorts eventually mature** — If 2024/2025 cohorts follow the same trajectory as pre-2022 (negative → 8%+), this is timing not structure
- [ ] **2026 rate increase provides relief** — "5.1% rate increase for 2026 vs 2.2% proposed; $30 billion more in taxpayer money"
- [ ] **Payers may build enablement internally** — CVS pursuing physician enablement as core strategy; could squeeze third-party margins
- [ ] **CMS scrutiny on risk coding intensity increasing** — V28 reflects regulatory push to reduce risk score inflation; enablers face same pressure

**The counter-thesis:** Claims editing content moat (130+ knowledge packs at Optum/Lyric) may protect incumbents in payment integrity. For VBC, if CMS meaningfully raises MA rates (>5% annually) or relaxes V28 implementation, integrated models could recover margins. If OptumHealth's 2024/2025 cohorts mature to positive margins by 2027-2028, the structural failure thesis is wrong—it was just timing.

## Timeline

**Now - 2026:**
- Market shift accelerates: 70/30 post-pay → 50/50 split
- Rawlings-Machinify and Cotiviti-Edifecs integrations play out
- Mid-tier payers adopt startup pre-pay solutions (Charta Health, Codoxo, Autonomize AI)
- HealthEdge wins Medicaid beachhead deals (single state, <1M lives)

**2027 - 2028:**
- Pre-pay becomes standard infrastructure for top-20 payers
- Post-pay market compresses measurably
- First major commercial CAPS migration completes (3M+ lives)
- Claims editing content becomes competitive differentiator

**2029+:**
- 30/70 post-pay/pre-pay market structure
- Cloud becomes default for mid-market payers
- Market structure: UNH/Elevance in-house, HealthEdge mid-market, AI-native pre-pay platforms across segments

---

## Startup Opportunities

### 1. Provider-Side Pre-Submit Accuracy
**Why:** "Charta Health is a solution that allows us to assess completely on the front-end...ensure your claim is as clean and accurate as it can be prior to it being transmitted to the clearinghouse." Denial rates reduced from 13% to 3%.
**Wedge:** High-volume ambulatory/outpatient providers (physical therapy, imaging centers, physician groups) with 20,000+ claims/year
**Risk:** Epic/Cerner build native capabilities; payer pre-pay catches same errors downstream

### 2. Mid-Tier Payer Pre-Pay Platform
**Why:** "Cotiviti doesn't have the good solution for mid-tier...that is their weaker play." Mid-tier payers (500K-2M members) "more willing to adopt upstart solutions."
**Wedge:** Regional Blues, Medicaid MCOs, smaller MA plans that can't afford Cotiviti's $25-40M annual contracts
**Risk:** Large vendors move downmarket; limited deal size caps growth

### 3. Claims Editing Content Platform
**Why:** "Editors are more based on the content than they are the system performance." $100M+ annual savings gap between leaders and laggards.
**Wedge:** Build specialty-specific knowledge packs (OB-GYN, oncology, orthopedics) that HealthEdge and others can integrate
**Risk:** Optum and Lyric have 130+ knowledge packs vs. 13 at Burgess; catching up requires massive investment

### 4. Migration Services for Mid-Market Payers
**Why:** "The cost to move in this climate are insanely high." All-or-nothing migration requires expertise.
**Wedge:** Target 1-5M life payers with turnkey HealthEdge implementation
**Risk:** Consulting-style business, hard to scale

---

## Watch For

### Signals This Thesis is RIGHT:
- Rawlings or Phia Group revenue declines 10%+ YoY
- Cotiviti pre-pay revenue grows faster than post-pay
- HealthEdge announces 3+ Medicaid wins in different states
- Centene or Humana announces RFP for CAPS replacement
- Mid-tier payer case study shows 50%+ reduction in post-pay vendor spend

### Signals This Thesis is WRONG:
- Post-pay vendors maintain revenue growth through volume
- Pre-pay false positive rates remain high (>50%), causing provider backlash
- UNH/Elevance successfully migrate homegrown to cloud without vended CAPS
- HealthEdge fails to win commercial payers >3M lives
- Payer internal builds dominate, independent vendor market stagnates
