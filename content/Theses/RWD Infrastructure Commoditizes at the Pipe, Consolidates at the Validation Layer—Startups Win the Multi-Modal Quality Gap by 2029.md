## The Take

**Consensus:** RWD infrastructure is a growing market where scale wins. Datavant dominates linking, IQVIA/Optum own analytics, and the FDA's December 2025 barrier removal accelerates adoption across the board. Biggest players get biggest.

**Today:** Consensus misses the divergence. The tokenization/linking layer (Datavant's core) will commoditize within 3-5 years as CMS mandates full interoperability and TEFCA matures, while the validation layer—making multi-modal RWD FDA-acceptable—consolidates into 2-3 dominant platforms. The startup opportunity is NOT in more data or better pipes. It is in multi-modal data quality (genomics + claims + imaging + wearables + PROs), identified-data workflows for precision medicine, and computable phenotype platforms that don't exist yet.

The ownership paradox is settled: Flatiron's clinical research business sold December 2025; Roche wrote off $3.2B. Neutral wins. But neutral infrastructure itself faces a second-order threat—CMS interoperability mandates and TEFCA turn basic linking into a utility. Datavant's $1B+ revenue and 80,000+ hospital network make it the incumbent, but its moat shifts from "we connect" to "we validate at regulatory grade." The $2.38B RWD market growing to $6.1B by 2032 (14.4% CAGR) is real, but the value distribution within that market is about to rotate dramatically.

FDA removed the patient-level data requirement December 2025—the most significant regulatory shift in a decade. Only 12 drugs in 14 years included RWE under prior rules. The barrier removal doesn't lower quality bars; it raises volume. Every pharma company will now attempt RWD submissions. Most will fail on quality. The companies that solve quality for multi-modal, cross-institutional data win the next decade.

New data modalities create new moats. Claims + EHR linking is table stakes by 2028. But genomics + claims + imaging + wearable sensor data + patient-reported outcomes (PROs) require fundamentally different validation infrastructure. No platform handles this today. The identified-data trend compounds this: as precision medicine grows from $119B (2025) to $537B (2035) at 16.26% CAGR, de-identified aggregate data becomes less valuable than identified, longitudinal, multi-modal patient records. This inverts the privacy-first model that built the current RWD infrastructure.

**In 3-5 years:** Basic data linking is a utility (commoditized by interop mandates). Validation infrastructure is a regulated oligopoly (2-3 platforms). Multi-modal data quality platforms are the new moat. Identified data workflows for precision medicine command premium pricing. Startups that build computable phenotype platforms and multi-modal validation win the quality gap that incumbents cannot close with scale alone.

**How this evolved:**
- *2026-01-27:* **MERGE + REBUILD** — Consolidated "Real-World Data Infrastructure Becomes Pharma Critical Path" and "Neutral RWD Infrastructure Beats Captive Data—Datavant Model Wins." Added forward-looking analysis on commoditization dynamics, multi-modal data types, identified vs. de-identified data implications. Contrarian threats: CMS interop mandates commoditize Datavant's core; IQVIA/Optum add quality layers faster than expected; identified-data regulation tightens.
- *2026-01-26:* **REBUILD** (both source theses) — Flatiron clinical research sold Dec 2025, FDA barrier removal confirmed, LLM extraction at 88-93% F1 but validation gap persists.
- *2026-01-10:* Created Neutral RWD thesis from deep dive on pharma SaaS moats.
- *2026-01-05:* Created RWD Infrastructure thesis from /new-thesis clustering.

## Bear Case

- [x] **Tempus data licensing more durable than predicted** — 38% growth via diagnostics lock-in; doesn't require neutrality because diagnostics creates the data relationship ([Tempus Q3 2025](https://www.tempus.com/news/tempus-reports-third-quarter-2025-results/))
- [x] **Common FDA rejection reasons persist** — Heterogeneous populations, supportive-not-pivotal quality remain main rejection drivers; quality bar is genuinely high ([RAPS](https://www.raps.org/news-and-articles/news-articles/2025/9/fda-official-updates-on-advancing-rwe-program,-lis))
- [x] **IQVIA 33% + Optum 24% combined health analytics share** — Incumbents have massive scale and existing pharma relationships ([Mahalo Health](https://www.mahalo.health/insights/top-real-world-evidence-rwe-platforms))
- [ ] **CMS interop mandates DON'T commoditize linking** — TEFCA implementation stalls; fragmentation persists; Datavant's pipe moat holds
- [ ] **Identified-data regulations tighten** — State/federal privacy laws restrict identified data use; precision medicine data model becomes legally impossible
- [ ] **LLMs achieve FDA-accepted validation** — John Snow Labs "FDA-ready" platform (Jan 2026) or equivalent gains regulatory acceptance; validation layer commoditizes
- [ ] **IQVIA/Optum build competitive quality/validation infrastructure** — Incumbents add quality layer faster than startups differentiate
- [ ] **Pharma builds internal multi-modal infrastructure** — Large pharma prefers owned capabilities for regulatory-critical submissions
- [ ] **Big tech enters** — Google/Microsoft/AWS launch healthcare data quality platforms

**What would have to be true for you to be wrong?** Two scenarios break this thesis. First: CMS interoperability mandates fail to commoditize linking, AND incumbents (IQVIA/Optum) successfully add quality/validation layers using their existing scale advantage. In this world, the infrastructure market consolidates around 2-3 large incumbents and startups have no gap to exploit. Second: identified-data regulations tighten rather than loosen, killing the precision medicine data premium. If HIPAA enforcement intensifies and state privacy laws proliferate, de-identified aggregate data remains the dominant model, and Datavant's current architecture wins indefinitely. Both scenarios require regulatory reversals that contradict current trajectories—CMS is pushing interop, not retreating, and FDA is liberalizing RWD use, not restricting it—but regulatory reversals are precisely the kind of risk that feels impossible until it happens.

## Timeline

**Now to 2026:**
- FDA RWE guidance operationalized (February 2026)
- QMSR compliance deadline February 2, 2026
- Datavant continues M&A ("one or two" acquisitions planned)
- Watch for: Roche full Flatiron divestiture; first major RWD-driven NDA submission
- Early movers on multi-modal data quality (genomics + EHR + claims) begin differentiation
- Pharma companies pilot RWD for supplementary evidence at scale post-barrier removal

**2027 to 2028:**
- FDA publishes definitive RWD requirements for drug regulatory submissions
- CMS interop mandates (TEFCA) begin commoditizing basic data linking
- Critical threshold: 10+ FDA decisions significantly influenced by RWD
- Datavant IPO potential at $10B+ if neutrality maintained AND validation layer built
- Multi-modal data quality platforms reach early traction ($10-50M ARR)
- Identified-data workflows emerge for precision oncology and rare disease
- Tempus data licensing vs. diagnostics revenue mix reveals whether multi-modal creates durable moat

**2029+:**
- Basic data linking is utility-priced; validation is premium-priced
- 2-3 platforms dominate regulatory-grade validation layer
- Multi-modal RWD (genomics + claims + imaging + wearables + PROs) required for precision medicine submissions
- Identified longitudinal records command 3-5x premium over de-identified aggregates
- Traditional CROs must integrate RWD infrastructure or lose relevance
- Rare disease trials become feasible through distributed multi-modal networks
- Computable phenotype platforms standardize; early movers have regulatory relationships

---

## Startup Opportunities

**1. Computable Phenotype Platform**
- Why this follows: FDA requires algorithmic patient population definitions for every RWD submission. No dominant standard solution exists. This is a gap, not a feature request.
- Wedge: Partner with 3-5 academic medical centers to develop and validate phenotypes; integrate with OMOP/Sentinel; build FDA audit trail relationships
- Risk: Epic/Cerner bundle phenotype tools; OHDSI open-source commoditizes; Datavant acquires a phenotype startup

**2. Multi-Modal RWD Quality Platform (Genomics + Claims + Imaging)**
- Why this follows: Current validation infrastructure handles EHR + claims. Nobody handles genomics + claims + imaging + wearable data in a unified validation framework. Precision medicine at $537B by 2035 demands this.
- Wedge: Start with oncology (Tempus-adjacent but neutral); combine tumor genomics, imaging pathology, claims, and clinical data with regulatory-grade QA/QC
- Risk: Tempus extends from diagnostics into neutral infrastructure; Datavant acquires multi-modal capability; data types remain siloed by regulation

**3. RWD Validation-as-a-Service**
- Why this follows: Every RWD submission requires QA/QC and audit documentation. LLMs handle extraction; humans validate. This is the regulatory-grade "last mile."
- Wedge: Regulatory consulting expertise + software automation; target mid-tier pharma without internal infrastructure
- Risk: CROs add validation services; Datavant bundles validation with linkage; LLMs achieve FDA-accepted validation

**4. Identified Longitudinal Data Exchange for Precision Medicine**
- Why this follows: De-identified data sufficed for population-level RWE. Precision medicine requires identified, longitudinal, multi-modal records. Current infrastructure is built for de-identification. The inversion is coming.
- Wedge: Build consent-first identified data exchange; start with rare disease patient registries where patients actively want data shared
- Risk: Privacy regulations tighten (state laws, HIPAA enforcement); Datavant pivots to identified workflows; patient consent fatigue limits adoption

**5. Neutral Specialty Data Networks (Rare Disease, Pediatrics)**
- Why this follows: Datavant dominates broad horizontal infrastructure; vertical data networks for underserved therapeutic areas remain fragmented
- Wedge: Build neutral data exchange for rare disease (high unmet need, active patient communities, pharma willingness to pay premium)
- Risk: Datavant acquires specialty networks; pharma builds internal specialty data capabilities

## Watch For

**If RIGHT:**
- CMS interop mandates (TEFCA) reduce Datavant's linking pricing power by 2028
- Multi-modal data quality startup raises $50M+ Series B (validates new moat)
- FDA approves drug with RWD as primary efficacy evidence (not just safety)
- Pharma companies announce "multi-modal RWD-first" strategy
- Identified data workflows command measurable premium over de-identified
- Roche fully divests remaining Flatiron assets
- Datavant acquires a validation or phenotype company (confirms pipe-to-quality pivot)

**If WRONG:**
- CMS interop mandates stall; TEFCA implementation delayed past 2029
- IQVIA/Optum launch competitive quality/validation products winning major pharma deals
- Multi-modal data platforms fail to gain traction; EHR + claims remains sufficient
- Identified-data regulations tighten; state privacy laws proliferate
- LLM-based validation achieves FDA acceptance (John Snow Labs or equivalent)
- Datavant maintains linking pricing power with no quality-layer pivot needed
- Tempus data licensing grows to majority of revenue (proves captive diagnostics-data model sustainable without neutrality)

*Confidence: HIGH -- Ownership paradox proven (Flatiron sold Dec 2025, $3.2B writeoff). Neutral model validated (Datavant $1B+, profitable, $7B). FDA barrier removal is most significant regulatory shift in a decade (12 drugs in 14 years under old rules). Forward risk is commoditization of the linking layer itself via CMS interop mandates -- but this CREATES the startup opportunity in validation and multi-modal quality rather than destroying it.*
*Last rebuilt: 2026-01-27*
*Contrarian threats: CMS interop stalls (linking stays defensible); IQVIA/Optum add quality layer; identified-data regulation tightens; LLM validation achieves FDA acceptance*
