# Thesis: Pre-Pay Beats Post-Pay—$9B Market Shift Happening Now

## Investment Take

Payment integrity is shifting from post-pay recovery to pre-pay prevention—and the economics are brutal for laggards. Pre-pay market is $9B vs post-pay $2-3B ([[Sr Technical Product Manager at Optum _ Cotiviti Holdings, Inc. _ Tegus]]). The math: post-pay recovers $0.40 of every $1 after vendor fees. Pre-pay prevents the dollar from leaving.

The waste is staggering. $900B annual healthcare waste is the target ([[Sr Technical Product Manager at Optum _ Cotiviti Holdings, Inc. _ Tegus]]). Current post-pay funnels have 3% success rate—100K flagged claims yield only 3,150 recoveries. 70% false positives cost $7M+/year in analyst time alone ($35/hr × 210K hours). AI-driven pre-pay could push success rates to 15-20%.

Cotiviti is making the move. $9.5B payment waste recovered annually, 78%+ renewal rate ([[Global Vice President, Channels, Innovation & In Direct Ecosystems at Bmc Software Inc _ Cotiviti Holdings, Inc. _ Tegus]]). Acquired Edifecs (March 2025) to move upstream into claims editing and pre-pay. For a 2M-member health plan: $25-40M annual fees generate $130-140M in savings (6-8x ROI).

**The investment angle:** Post-pay vendors are sitting ducks. Pre-pay requires AI/NLP that legacy vendors don't have. First movers capture the $9B market while incumbents squeeze the shrinking $2-3B post-pay pool.

**How this evolved:**
- *2025-12-21:* Emerged from Cotiviti/Optum Tegus cluster. Clear market shift from post-pay to pre-pay with specific economics: $9B vs $2-3B, 3% vs 15-20% success rates.
- *2025-12-21:* Market data confirms shift. Codoxo survey: 54% focus on pre-pay, only 38% post-pay. Provider education generates $4,000-$7,000 PMPY savings ($2M-$3.5M annually for 500k plan). 62% of payers lack automated education platform—market still early ([[Customer-Conference-Infographic-1]]). SVB Future of Healthtech 2025: 46% of hospitals use AI in RCM, provider ops is 44% of all healthtech investment ($5.5B YTD on track to beat 2021's $7.8B) ([[future-of-healthtech-2025-v2]]).
- *2025-12-22:* **PE is buying the thesis.** Machinify (New Mountain Capital) acquired Performant Healthcare for $670M—second major acquisition in 2025 ([[2025-12-21-machinify-completes-acquisition-of-performant-heal]]). Now 170M+ lives, "billions in savings." Strategy explicit: "end-to-end intelligence—spanning claim error detection, prevention, recovery." This is the pre-pay + post-pay consolidation play.
- *2025-12-22:* **UHC confirms 70% upstream shift over 18 years.** UHC product director (64M members) explained the investment shift: "70% of spend now upstream vs 100% post-pay 18 years ago." Post-pay success rate only 3%; pre-pay AI could cut false positives from 70% to 30-40%, potentially shrinking subrogation volume 60%. But warned: deep claims infrastructure integration favors in-house builds over vendors ([[sr-technical-product-manager-at-optum-_-cotiviti-holdings-in]]).

## Bull Case

- [x] **Pre-pay market 4x larger.** $9B pre-pay vs $2-3B post-pay. Economics favor prevention over recovery.
  - *Evidence:* [[Sr Technical Product Manager at Optum _ Cotiviti Holdings, Inc. _ Tegus]] — Market sizing validated

- [ ] **Incumbents can't pivot fast.** Post-pay vendors built on manual review. AI/NLP required for pre-pay. 18-24 month rebuild.
  - *Evidence:* [[Global Vice President, Channels, Innovation & In Direct Ecosystems at Bmc Software Inc _ Cotiviti Holdings, Inc. _ Tegus]] — Cotiviti acquiring Edifecs to fill gap

- [ ] **ROI is undeniable.** 6-8x ROI for health plans. $130-140M savings on $25-40M fees.
  - *Evidence:* [[Global Vice President, Channels, Innovation & In Direct Ecosystems at Bmc Software Inc _ Cotiviti Holdings, Inc. _ Tegus]] — 2M-member plan economics

---

## Bear Case

- [ ] **Cotiviti wins by default.** If Edifecs acquisition succeeds, Cotiviti owns pre-pay. Startups locked out.
  - *Evidence:* Needs monitoring — Track Edifecs integration progress

- [ ] **Payers build internally.** UHC, Anthem, Cigna have data and capital. Could build pre-pay in-house.
  - *Evidence:* Needs monitoring — Track payer AI announcements

- [ ] **False positive problem persists.** If AI can't reduce 70% false positive rate, analyst costs just shift from post to pre.
  - *Evidence:* Needs validation — Interview Cotiviti customers on accuracy

## Startup Opportunities

**1. Pre-Pay Claims Intelligence**
- AI/NLP for claims editing before submission
- Why this follows: $9B market, incumbents playing catch-up
- Wedge: Specialty claims (oncology, rare disease) where rules are complex
- Risk: Cotiviti/Edifecs may dominate

**2. False Positive Reduction**
- ML to cut 70% false positive rate, save $7M+/year in analyst time
- Why this follows: Current 3% success rate is embarrassing
- Wedge: Specific claim types where pattern recognition works
- Risk: Requires large training datasets from payers

**3. Provider-Side Pre-Bill**
- Charta/SmarterDx model: catch errors before claim leaves provider
- Why this follows: Providers lose on denials, payers lose on recovery costs
- Wedge: Both sides win, easier sale
- Risk: Fragmented provider market

## Open Questions

**Does Cotiviti/Edifecs lock up the market?**
→ OPEN: If integration succeeds and they bundle pre-pay, hard for startups. If integration stumbles (common in M&A), window opens.

**Will payers share data for AI training?**
→ OPEN: Pre-pay AI needs claims data. If payers keep siloed, startups can't train models. If federated learning works, opportunity opens.

**How fast can false positives drop?**
→ OPEN: If AI cuts 70%→20% false positives, massive value. If stuck at 50%+, economics don't shift enough.
