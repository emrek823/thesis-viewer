# Thesis: Drug Discovery Data Beats Algorithms—Computational Design Commoditizes, Clinical Outcomes Win by 2029

## Mechanism

AI drug discovery moats come from proprietary data (not model architecture) because: (1) computational design commoditizes (Chai-2 86% developability, OpenMidnight SOTA for $1.6K, RFdiffusion3 10x faster), (2) wet lab experimental data creates near-term moats (Recursion 65PB), and (3) clinical outcome data becomes the ultimate defensible asset (Tempus $1B+ platform, Datavant 100B+ records) → data platforms win; algorithm-only companies become commodity

---

## Investment Take

**Consensus believes:** Drug discovery AI moats come from model architecture, proprietary algorithms, or the "best" foundation models. Investors chase companies with the largest training datasets of molecular structures or the most sophisticated computational approaches.

**Actually:** The entire computational layer is commoditizing faster than expected:

1. **Design becomes software.** RFdiffusion3 solves 37/41 enzyme benchmarks (vs 16 for previous methods). Chai-2 achieves 86% developability. OpenMidnight hits SOTA pathology for $1.6K. Fewer than 100 designs need testing to find a successful catalyst, down from tens of thousands.

2. **Wet lab data creates moats (for now).** Companies that generate proprietary experimental data at scale—Recursion (65PB phenomics), Insitro (iPSC screens)—own the data that computational-only companies can't replicate. The flywheel: ML predictions → experiments → better models.

3. **Clinical outcome data is the ultimate moat.** Population-scale validation in real humans (EHR-linked biobanks, Phase II/III results, RWE) is the scarcest asset. PROTON validated in n=610,524 patients (HR=0.63, p<10^-7). 9/11 mutation-effect models perform worse than random on human population data.

**The hierarchy:** Algorithms < Wet Lab Data < Clinical Outcome Data

**In 5-10 years:**
- **Winners:** Clinical outcome data platforms (Tempus: $1B+ platform, 9-year head start; Datavant: 100B+ records; Ciitizen: 10M+ patient records). Wet lab-integrated companies (Recursion, Insitro) that generate proprietary experimental data. Compute infrastructure (NVIDIA, cloud).
- **Losers:** AI drug discovery companies differentiating on model architecture alone. Pure computational startups without data generation. Service CROs without ML integration.
- **Market structure:** Drug discovery becomes a compute problem with data moats. Health data networks consolidate into winner-take-most connectivity layers. Clinical outcome data licenses become the scarce asset.

**How this evolved:**
- *2025-12-20:* Chai-2 proved computational methods solve binding-to-druggable gap
- *2025-12-21:* PROTON validated in 610K patients—moat shifted to clinical outcome data
- *2025-12-27:* OpenMidnight at $1.6K proved foundation models commoditize
- *2025-12-29:* Recursion REC-4881 positive Phase 1b/2—first major clinical validation
- *2026-01-07:* **MERGED** — Three theses (Wet Lab Flywheels, Protein Design Software, Clinical Outcome Data) combined under unified "data beats algorithms" frame

## Bull Case

### Computational Commoditization
- [x] **Protein design becomes software.** RFdiffusion3 achieves 37/41 enzyme benchmarks vs 16 for previous methods. 10x faster than RFD2. <100 designs need testing vs tens of thousands. ([[2025-12-29-rfdiffusion3-protein-design-at-all-atom-resolution]])
- [x] **Computational developability is solved.** Chai-2 achieved 86% developability and 16% hit rate (100x improvement). ([[Chai Discovery unveils Chai-2 with 86% developability and 16% hit rate]])
- [x] **Foundation models commoditize.** OpenMidnight achieved SOTA pathology on 12K slides for $1.6K. Training cost not correlated with performance. ([[How to Train a State-of-the-Art Pathology Foundation Model with $1.6k]])
- [x] **Open-source matches proprietary.** Boltz-2 and Chai-1 match AlphaFold3 accuracy. Structure prediction is commoditized. ([[Structure Prediction Commoditizes - AlphaFold3 vs Boltz vs Chai]])

### Wet Lab Data Moats
- [x] **Flywheel effects demonstrated.** Recursion's 65PB phenomics platform shows improving predictions with data scale. Positive Phase 1b/2 for REC-4881—first major clinical validation. ([[Recursion Boltz-2 Partnership and REC-4881 Results]])
- [x] **Pharma partnerships validate model.** $B+ partnerships (Recursion-Roche, Insitro-BMS, Lilly TuneLab). Big pharma believes in data moats. ([[2025-12-21-lilly-launches-tunelab-platform-to-give-biotechnol]])
- [ ] **Pure computational struggles.** AI drug discovery companies without wet labs face GTM challenges

### Clinical Outcome Data Moats
- [x] **Population-scale validation differentiates.** PROTON tested in n=610,524 patients; 5 drugs reduced dementia risk (HR=0.63, p<10^-7). The differentiator is validation against real outcomes. ([[Graph AI generates neurological hypotheses validated in molecular, organoid, and clinical systems]])
- [x] **Existing models fail on real human data.** 9/11 mutation-effect models perform worse than random on human population data. G2P Bio's SLMM trained on population outcomes achieved 20x improvement. ([[GPT_Bio_Pitch_Deck]])
- [x] **Clinical outcome data compounds via network effects.** Datavant: 100B+ patient records, 200+ organizations, 157% CAGR, 150% NRR with zero churn. ([[datavant-corporate-overview-deck-2-22-20-1-1-b6910f1a]])
- [x] **$1B+ moats exist in outcome-linked data.** Tempus: "$1B+ platform investment over 9 years... significant capital for another player to catch up." ([[initiating-coverage-of-a-differentiated-specialty-laboratory-9f1a7e9c]])
- [ ] **Human genetic linkage predicts success.** Projects with human genetic linkage: 73% active/successful vs 43% without. 2x success rate. ([[the-role-of-human-genetics-in-drug-discovery-9e4348fe]])

---

## Bear Case

- [ ] **Open-source catches up faster than expected.** If RFdiffusion + AlphaFold3 + Boltz-2 reach clinical validation rates within 12 months, even downstream data moats erode. BindCraft already achieves 10-100% hit rates.
- [ ] **Clinical failures reset narrative.** If AI-discovered drugs fail Phase II/III, "AI-discovered" becomes stigma. BenevolentAI's 90% valuation collapse shows market unforgiving.
- [ ] **No AI drugs approved yet.** Despite $3.2B+ invested, zero approvals. 8 programs in clinic as of 2025. Bubble risk if optimism not matched by reality.
- [ ] **Federated learning enables data sharing.** If Lilly TuneLab and similar federated approaches enable cross-pharma outcome sharing, data moats erode and network effects don't compound.
- [ ] **Foundation models generalize.** AlphaFold-level breakthroughs could obviate proprietary experimental data.
- [ ] **Regulatory agencies require traditional validation.** FDA has not created accelerated pathways specifically for AI-designed therapeutics.

**The counter-thesis:** If open-source AI achieves comparable clinical translation rates and federated learning enables frictionless outcome data sharing across pharma, then both computational and data moats erode—it becomes commoditized infrastructure.

- Open-source computational tools reach parity on standard benchmarks
- Critical threshold: If AI-discovered drugs show 50% Phase II success (vs 30% baseline)
- Market bifurcation: wet lab-integrated vs pure computational becomes clear

**2029+:**
- Health data networks consolidate into 2-3 dominant platforms
- Clinical outcome data licensing becomes primary revenue model
- Drug discovery looks like software development (design in-silico, validate via contract labs)
- Potential: $50B+ TAM in clinical outcome data licensing

## Startup Opportunities

### Data Platform Plays
**1. Clinical Outcome Data Network (Datavant/Ciitizen model)**
- Why this follows: Winner-take-most network effects proven. Datavant: 157% CAGR, 150% NRR, zero churn.
- Wedge: Rare disease patient communities, advocacy group partnerships. LLM-based data extraction from unstructured EHR.
- Risk: Privacy regulations tightening. Competition from pharma building internal capabilities.

**2. Population Genomics Validation Platform (G2P model)**
- Why this follows: 9/11 models fail on real human data. Altos Labs paid $100K and changed R&D based on G2P Bio analysis.
- Wedge: Start with biobank partnerships (UK Biobank, All of Us). Sell validation services to pharma.
- Risk: Biobank access increasingly competitive.

**3. Outcome-Linked Pathology Intelligence**
- Why this follows: EAGLE (MSK) proved fine-tuned foundation models achieve clinical-grade accuracy when trained on ground truth outcome data.
- Wedge: Partner with academic medical centers with MSK-IMPACT-equivalent molecular ground truth.
- Risk: Regulatory pathway unclear. Requires large institutional partnerships.

### Infrastructure Plays
**4. Cloud Biotech Platform (Asset-Light Drug Discovery)**
- Why this follows: RFdiffusion3 makes "100 designs to find a winner" economically viable.
- Wedge: Design in-silico using RFdiffusion/AlphaFold, validate through contract labs, manufacture via CDMOs.
- Risk: Regulatory path for AI-designed drugs unclear.

**5. AI-Native CRO**
- Why this follows: Traditional CROs vulnerable as wet lab moat becomes liability.
- Wedge: Lead with in-silico design, use wet lab only for validation.
- Risk: Requires bridging ML + biology cultures.

## Watch For

**If RIGHT (thesis plays out):**
- AI-discovered drugs show higher Phase II success rates than industry baseline (30%)
- Tempus, Datavant, or similar data platforms command premium valuations vs computational-only
- Open-source foundation models achieve parity on benchmarks but lag on clinical translation
- Pharma M&A targets shift from "best AI" to "best outcome data assets"
- CRO market contracts or major CRO margin compression
- Startup achieves IND with <$10M and <18 months from concept

**If WRONG (thesis fails):**
- Open-source tools achieve equivalent clinical translation rates
- AI-discovered drugs fail Phase II/III at rates equal or worse than traditional discovery
- Lilly TuneLab and federated learning create liquid market for outcome data
- FDA requires traditional validation pathways regardless of in-silico accuracy
- Pure computational company achieves successful drug discovery exit
