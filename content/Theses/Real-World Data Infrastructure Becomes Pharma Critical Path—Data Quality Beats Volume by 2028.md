# Thesis: Real-World Data Infrastructure Becomes Pharma Critical Path—Data Quality Beats Volume by 2028

## Mechanism

Pharma companies require RWD infrastructure for regulatory submissions because FDA formalizes computable phenotypes, data validation, and quality requirements that raw data aggregators cannot meet → data quality/validation platforms (Datavant, Veeva, Flatiron) win; raw data aggregators without quality layer lose

---

## Investment Take

**Consensus believes:** Real-world data (RWD) value comes from scale—whoever has the most EHR/claims data wins. Pharma companies will pay for access to large datasets. The winners are data aggregators with the most lives covered.

**Actually:** FDA is formalizing RWD for regulatory decisions, creating specific infrastructure requirements (computable phenotypes, data validation, distributed networks, Common Data Models) that raw data aggregators cannot meet. Companies that solve data QUALITY—consent, structuring, validation, and regulatory compliance—capture the value layer. Volume without quality is worthless for regulatory submissions.

**The mechanism:** FDA's RWD guidance requires:
1. **Computable phenotypes** — algorithmic patient population definitions
2. **Data validation** — accuracy, completeness, and traceability documentation
3. **Distributed data networks** — federated queries across institutions
4. **Common Data Models** — standardized schemas (OMOP, Sentinel)
5. **QA/QC for regulatory submissions** — audit trails and provenance

Raw data aggregators (claims databases, EHR extracts) fail these requirements. Infrastructure players who solve quality/validation capture the regulatory moat.

**In 5-10 years:**
- **Winners:** Data quality/validation infrastructure (Datavant, Veeva, Flatiron), computable phenotype platforms, distributed data network operators
- **Losers:** Raw data aggregators without quality layer, point-solution analytics vendors, pharma internal data teams without infrastructure
- **Market structure:** RWD infrastructure becomes required layer for all pharma regulatory submissions; 2-3 platforms dominate the quality/validation layer

## Bull Case

- [x] **FDA formalizing RWD for regulatory decisions** — 50+ page guidance document specifies data quality requirements ([[real-world-data--assessing-electronic-health-records-and-med-0088ee5f]])
- [x] **Computable phenotypes required** — Algorithmic patient definitions, not manual chart review ([[real-world-data--assessing-electronic-health-records-and-med-0088ee5f]])
- [x] **Precision medicine market $119B→$537B** — 16.26% CAGR 2025-2035 creates massive demand ([[precision-medicine-market]])
- [ ] **First NDA approved with RWD as primary evidence** — Regulatory precedent established
- [ ] **Major pharma mandates RWD infrastructure** — Procurement requirement for all trials
- [ ] **Distributed data networks scale to 100M+ patients** — Critical mass for rare disease studies

---

## Bear Case

- [ ] **FDA reverses RWD acceptance** — Regulatory skepticism returns, traditional trials remain gold standard
- [ ] **Raw data aggregators add quality layer** — IQVIA, Optum build validation infrastructure
- [ ] **Pharma builds internal infrastructure** — Large pharma invests in owned RWD capabilities
- [ ] **Synthetic data replaces RWD** — AI-generated data eliminates need for real patient data
- [ ] **Privacy regulations restrict data linkage** — State/federal laws prevent cross-institutional data sharing

**The counter-thesis:** If FDA maintains traditional trial requirements and does not expand RWD acceptance, or if raw data aggregators successfully add quality/validation layers, then the infrastructure opportunity is smaller. Volume-based players could win if quality requirements remain soft.

## Timeline

**Now → 2026:**
- FDA continues issuing RWD guidance documents
- Pharma companies pilot RWD for supplementary evidence
- Watch for: First FDA approval citing RWD as significant evidence component

**2027 → 2028:**
- FDA publishes definitive RWD requirements for regulatory submissions
- Major pharma mandates RWD infrastructure for all trials
- Critical threshold: 10+ FDA decisions significantly influenced by RWD
- Data quality infrastructure providers reach $100M+ ARR

**2029+:**
- RWD infrastructure required for all pharma regulatory submissions
- 2-3 platforms dominate quality/validation layer
- Traditional CROs must integrate RWD infrastructure or lose relevance
- Rare disease trials become feasible through distributed data networks

## Startup Opportunities

**1. Computable Phenotype Platform**
- Why this follows: FDA requires algorithmic patient definitions; no standard solution exists
- Wedge: Partner with academic medical centers to develop and validate phenotypes
- Risk: Pharma builds internal; existing EHR vendors (Epic) bundle phenotype tools

**2. RWD Validation-as-a-Service**
- Why this follows: Every RWD submission requires QA/QC and audit documentation
- Wedge: Regulatory consulting expertise + software automation
- Risk: CROs add validation services; FDA requirements remain soft

**3. Distributed Data Network Operator**
- Why this follows: Federated queries across institutions required for scale
- Wedge: Start with oncology networks, expand to other therapeutic areas
- Risk: Existing networks (Flatiron, Tempus) dominate; data sharing agreements difficult

## Watch For

**If RIGHT (thesis plays out):**
- FDA approves drug with RWD as primary efficacy evidence (not just safety)
- Top 10 pharma announces "RWD-first" strategy for trial design
- Data quality infrastructure M&A (major pharma acquires validation platform)
- CRO partnerships with RWD infrastructure providers announced
- Raw data aggregator valuations decline relative to quality-layer providers

**If WRONG (thesis fails):**
- FDA issues guidance restricting RWD to supplementary evidence only
- Major RWD-based regulatory submission rejected for data quality issues
- IQVIA/Optum launch competitive quality/validation products
- Pharma companies build successful internal RWD infrastructure
- Synthetic data renders real-world data obsolete for regulatory purposes
