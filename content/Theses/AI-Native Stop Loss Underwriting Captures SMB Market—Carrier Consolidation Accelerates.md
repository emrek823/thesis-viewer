## The Take

**$39B stop-loss market (2024) growing 15% CAGR to $113B by 2034—AI unlocks $6-12B newly addressable SMB segment as level-funded penetration reaches 44% in small firms.**

AI-native underwriting doesn't predict catastrophic claims better—loss ratios worsened from 78.5% (2017) to 86.0% (2024). The value is market expansion: AI substitutes external population data for missing claims history, enabling quotes for small groups (<100 lives) that were "simply not possible before." Medical Risk Managers CEO confirmed this unlocks previously unaddressable market.

Value capture is contested but bifurcated. UnitedHealth has 2,000+ AI engineers, 1,000+ AI use cases, and launched Optum Real (Oct 2025)—but competing carriers avoid sharing data with a rival. Gradient AI ($89M raised) continues winning MGU customers (Evolution Risk, Connexure Oct 2025, NC League of Municipalities Feb 2025) where carriers focus on scale. The MGU layer remains the clear target.

**In 3-5 years:** Market consolidates to 5-7 dominant carriers. Gene therapy carve-outs ($2-4.5M treatments) standardize with BCS and Evernorth Embarc leading. Gradient AI either acquired for $300M-500M (bull case) or marginalized as carriers build internally (bear case). Level-funded reaches 50%+ penetration in small firms.

**How this evolved:**
- *2026-01-26:* **REBUILD** — Ran 7 contrarian queries. Milliman lawsuit vs. Gradient AI ongoing (MEDIUM threat). UnitedHealth Optum Real launched but no dedicated stop-loss AI (MEDIUM-HIGH threat). No regulatory crackdown on level-funded (LOW). 95% AI pilot failure rate industry-wide but Gradient AI continues winning customers. Verdict: CONFIRMED.
- *2026-01-26:* Previous rebuild — UnitedHealth 2,000+ AI engineers, Optum AI Marketplace threat assessed.
- *2026-01-07:* ADVERSARIAL REBUILD v2 — Found HIGH THREAT from large carrier internal AI.
- *2025-12-29:* Core research: "AI unlocks small group market by substituting external data."
- *2025-12-23:* Nationwide-Allstate $1.25B validates consolidation.

## Mechanism

[AI VENDORS + MGUs] substitute [EXTERNAL POPULATION DATA] for [MISSING CLAIMS HISTORY] because [SMALL EMPLOYERS LACK 2-3 YEARS DATA] → [SMB MARKET EXPANDS FROM 13% TO 44% LEVEL-FUNDED PENETRATION]

---

## Investment Take

**Today:** AI-native underwriting solves a data problem, not a prediction problem. Traditional underwriting requires 2-3 years of claims history, excluding small employers. AI substitutes external population data (medical, Rx, lab) to enable quoting groups that could never be quoted before. The market expansion is confirmed: level-funded grew from 13% (2020) to 44% (2025) in small firms (10-49 employees).

**Market dynamics:** Stop-loss premiums reached $39B in 2024 (11.2% annual growth), projected to $113B by 2034 at 15.1% CAGR. Self-funded plans now cover 67% of covered workers (131.8M Americans), gaining 2.3M members in 2024 while fully-insured lost 2.9M. Premium increases of 9-11% for 2026—highest in 15 years—accelerate employer flight from fully-insured.

**Problem:** Carrier profitability under pressure. Loss ratios worsened from 81.6% (2019) to 86.0% (2024). Cigna missed Q4 2024 on stop-loss losses (90-95% loss ratio vs. expected 83-88%), implementing "corrective actions" with 2025 tracking to expectations. Voya raised premiums 21%+. Sun Life reported $1M+ claims up 45% (2019-2022).

**Why now:** 2026 is the year of level-funded standardization. Employers face 9.5% healthcare cost increases (AON), exceeding $17,000 per employee. McKinsey projects 12M additional employees leaving fully-insured by 2030. Gene therapy carve-outs expanding—BCS quoting for 2026, Evernorth Embarc effective Jan 2026 covering $913K-$4.25M treatments.

**AI impact:** First-order: AI enables small group underwriting without claims history via data substitution. Second-order: Carriers consolidate (Nationwide-Allstate $1.25B July 2025, Prudential launched stop-loss Sept 2024). Third-order: Large carriers may internalize AI—UnitedHealth has 2,000+ AI engineers and launched Optum Real (Oct 2025)—but Optum's ownership creates competitive barriers. Competing carriers avoid sharing data with UnitedHealth.

**In 5-10 years:** Market bifurcates. Large carriers (top 25 control 87% of premium) build AI internally or negotiate hard on vendor pricing. MGUs (Medical Risk Managers, ATS, Evolution Risk) depend on vendors like Gradient AI. Value capture in the MGU segment is real—Gradient AI's dataset of "tens of millions of policies and claims" creates a moat smaller carriers cannot replicate. Question: Does Gradient AI sign a top-10 carrier (validates larger TAM) or remain MGU-only (ceiling confirmed)?

## The Counter Thesis

If large carriers (UnitedHealth, Cigna) internalize AI underwriting as table stakes AND the MGU layer gets squeezed through consolidation, technology vendor TAM shrinks dramatically. UnitedHealth's 2,000+ AI engineers and Optum Real platform demonstrate the capability exists. The question is deployment timing and competitive dynamics.

However, three factors protect the vendor thesis: (1) Optum ownership creates data-sharing barriers—competing carriers avoid feeding data to a rival; (2) MGUs cannot build internally and need vendors to compete; (3) Gradient AI's moat is customer lock-in and "tens of millions of claims" data, not competing with $400B+ carriers directly.

The Milliman lawsuit is a real risk. Patent/trade secret claims against Gradient AI's core technology could impair the company's ability to operate if decided adversely. The case has been ongoing since 2021 with expert testimony disputes reaching jury trial stage.

The prediction problem remains unsolved. Loss ratios worsened despite AI adoption. Gene therapy ($2-4.5M treatments), NICU costs, and rare diseases remain "lightning strikes" that AI cannot predict. The value is market expansion (quoting previously unquotable groups), not risk reduction.

## Timeline

**Now → 2026:**
- Watch for: Gradient AI Series D or acquisition rumors; Milliman lawsuit resolution
- Entry points: MGUs adopting AI-native underwriting (Evolution Risk, Western Skies, Arlo model)
- Level-funded continues growing (targeting 50%+ in small firms)
- Premium increases of 9-11% accelerate employer shift to self-funded
- Gene therapy carve-out products expand (BCS, Evernorth Embarc)
- Cigna 2025 stop-loss "tracking to expectations" after corrective actions

**2027 → 2028:**
- Inflection: Does Gradient AI sign a top-5 carrier (validates larger TAM) or remain MGU-only (ceiling confirmed)?
- Critical threshold: If UnitedHealth/Cigna announce dedicated stop-loss AI platforms AND Gradient AI loses renewals, thesis breaks
- 2-3 more carrier M&A deals expected (follow Nationwide-Allstate template)
- Gene therapy carve-outs standardize or remain niche
- Level-funded reaches 50%+ penetration in small groups

**2029+:**
- Market consolidates to 5-7 dominant carriers
- MGU layer either acquired by carriers or becomes embedded infrastructure
- AI underwriting commoditizes—moat is customer lock-in, not algorithms
- Gradient AI exit: $300M-500M acquisition (bull) or down-round/marginalization (bear)

---

## Startup Opportunities

**1. AI-Native MGU Platform (Gradient AI model)**
- Why this follows: M1 (market expansion) + M2 (consolidation) create demand for small group underwriting
- Wedge: Serve <500 life groups without claims history via data substitution
- Risk: Large carriers build in-house; Gradient AI already dominant; Milliman lawsuit creates precedent risk; limited TAM ceiling if carriers internalize

**2. Gene Therapy-Specific Stop-Loss (BCS model)**
- Why this follows: M3 (structural pricing gap) creates new product category
- Wedge: Carve out gene therapy risk ($2-4.5M per treatment) from traditional stop-loss; PMPM model vs. traditional reimbursement
- Risk: Frequency increases faster than pricing; adverse selection concentrates risk; only 3 gene therapy claims 2022-2024 across 2M covered lives (QBE)

**3. Level-Funded Product Infrastructure (TPA analytics)**
- Why this follows: M1 (SMB market unlock) requires TPA-level analytics for groups lacking sophisticated capabilities
- Wedge: Picks-and-shovels data platform for 87% of premium controlled by incumbents lacking modern analytics
- Risk: Gradient AI expanding into TPA segment; carriers building internally; data fragmentation across TPAs

---

## Watch For

**If RIGHT (thesis plays out):**
- Gradient AI acquired for $300M+ by carrier or PE
- Level-funded penetration exceeds 50% in small firms (KFF 2026)
- 2+ more carrier M&A deals in stop-loss
- Gradient AI signs a top-10 carrier (validates TAM expansion)
- Milliman lawsuit settled or decided in Gradient AI's favor

**If WRONG (thesis fails):**
- UnitedHealth or Cigna announces dedicated stop-loss AI platform
- Gradient AI loses 2+ major MGU renewals to carrier-internal solutions
- NY-style stop-loss restrictions spread to 5+ additional states
- Gradient AI down-round or exits market
- Milliman lawsuit results in injunction against Gradient AI's core technology
