## The Take

**Consensus:** Stop-loss is a mature insurance line where large carriers will eventually build AI internally, making vendor plays like Gradient AI temporary. Level-funded growth is real but AI's role is incremental improvement to existing underwriting.

**Today:** AI-native underwriting solves a data problem, not a prediction problem. Traditional underwriting requires 2-3 years of claims history, excluding small employers entirely. AI substitutes external population data (medical, Rx, lab) for missing claims history, enabling quotes for groups that could never be quoted before. The value is market expansion, not better prediction—loss ratios actually worsened from 78.5% (2017) to 86.0% (2024). Level-funded penetration grew from 13% (2020) to 44% (2025) in small firms (10-49 employees), confirming the mechanism.

Stop-loss premiums reached $39B in 2024 (11.2% annual growth), projected to $113B by 2034 at 15.1% CAGR. Self-funded plans now cover 67% of covered workers (131.8M Americans), gaining 2.3M members in 2024 while fully-insured lost 2.9M. Premium increases of 9-11% for 2026—highest in 15 years—accelerate employer flight from fully-insured. AI unlocks a $6-12B newly addressable SMB segment as level-funded penetration reaches 44% in small firms.

Value capture is contested but bifurcated. UnitedHealth has 2,000+ AI engineers, 1,000+ AI use cases, and launched Optum Real (Oct 2025)—but competing carriers avoid sharing data with a rival. Gradient AI ($89M raised) continues winning MGU customers (Evolution Risk, Connexure Oct 2025, NC League of Municipalities Feb 2025) where carriers focus on scale. The MGU layer remains the clear target. Carrier profitability is under pressure: loss ratios worsened to 86.0% (2024). Cigna missed Q4 2024 on stop-loss losses (90-95% loss ratio vs. expected 83-88%). Voya raised premiums 21%+. Sun Life reported $1M+ claims up 45% (2019-2022).

Gene therapy carve-outs ($2-4.5M treatments) are creating a new product category. BCS Financial is quoting gene therapy stop-loss for 2026; Evernorth Embarc covers $913K-$4.25M treatments effective Jan 2026. McKinsey projects 12M additional employees leaving fully-insured by 2030.

**In 3-5 years:** Market consolidates to 5-7 dominant carriers. Gene therapy carve-outs standardize with BCS and Evernorth Embarc leading. Gradient AI either acquired for $300M-500M (bull case) or marginalized as carriers build internally (bear case). Level-funded reaches 50%+ penetration in small firms. AI underwriting commoditizes—moat is customer lock-in and data ("tens of millions of claims"), not algorithms.

**How this evolved:**
- *2026-01-26:* **REBUILD** — Ran 7 contrarian queries. Milliman lawsuit vs. Gradient AI ongoing (MEDIUM threat). UnitedHealth Optum Real launched but no dedicated stop-loss AI (MEDIUM-HIGH threat). No regulatory crackdown on level-funded (LOW). 95% AI pilot failure rate industry-wide but Gradient AI continues winning customers. Verdict: CONFIRMED.
- *2026-01-26:* Previous rebuild — UnitedHealth 2,000+ AI engineers, Optum AI Marketplace threat assessed.
- *2026-01-07:* ADVERSARIAL REBUILD v2 — Found HIGH THREAT from large carrier internal AI.
- *2025-12-29:* Core research: "AI unlocks small group market by substituting external data."
- *2025-12-23:* Nationwide-Allstate $1.25B validates consolidation.

## Bear Case

- [x] **Large carriers building AI internally** — UnitedHealth has 2,000+ AI engineers, 1,000+ AI use cases, launched Optum Real claims platform Oct 2025. Craig Kurtzweil: "At our core, we're a data company" ([[Sources/Market-Research-PDFs/claude-ai-opportunities-in-stop-loss-insurance-for-healthcar-e333d1b5]])
- [x] **95% AI pilot failure rate** — MIT State of AI in Business 2025 reports 95% of generative AI pilots fail. 99% of insurers struggling with AI tools; satisfaction dropped from 22% (2023) to 1% (2025) ([[Sources/Market-Research-PDFs/claude-ai-opportunities-in-stop-loss-insurance-for-healthcar-e333d1b5]])
- [x] **Carrier profitability crisis** — Loss ratios worsened to 86.0% (2024) from 81.6% (2019). Cigna Q4 2024 loss ratio 90-95% vs. expected 83-88%. Voya 21%+ premium increases. Sun Life $1M+ claims up 45% ([[Sources/Market-Research-PDFs/claude-ai-opportunities-in-stop-loss-insurance-for-healthcar-e333d1b5]])
- [x] **Milliman lawsuit against Gradient AI** — Milliman sued Gradient AI in 2021 for patent infringement and trade secret misappropriation. Case ongoing in D. Mass., jury trial pending after Dec 2023 Daubert ruling ([[Sources/Market-Research-PDFs/claude-ai-opportunities-in-stop-loss-insurance-for-healthcar-e333d1b5]])
- [ ] **Level-funded regulatory risk** — DOL, HHS, Treasury (July 2023) expressed concerns about stop-loss bypassing consumer protections. NY, CA, DE restrict stop-loss for small employers. No aggressive federal action has materialized ([[Sources/Market-Research-PDFs/claude-ai-opportunities-in-stop-loss-insurance-for-healthcar-e333d1b5]])
- [x] **AI claim denial lawsuits creating scrutiny** — UnitedHealth, Cigna, Humana facing lawsuits alleging AI led to denied care; Sen. Blumenthal pressing for disclosure of AI use ([[Sources/Market-Research-PDFs/claude-ai-opportunities-in-stop-loss-insurance-for-healthcar-e333d1b5]])

**What would have to be true for you to be wrong?** If large carriers (UnitedHealth, Cigna) internalize AI underwriting as table stakes AND the MGU layer gets squeezed through consolidation, technology vendor TAM shrinks dramatically. UnitedHealth's 2,000+ AI engineers and Optum Real platform demonstrate the capability exists. However, three factors protect the vendor thesis: (1) Optum ownership creates data-sharing barriers—competing carriers avoid feeding data to a rival; (2) MGUs cannot build internally and need vendors to compete; (3) Gradient AI's moat is customer lock-in and "tens of millions of claims" data, not competing with $400B+ carriers directly. The Milliman lawsuit is a real risk—patent/trade secret claims against Gradient AI's core technology could impair operations if decided adversely. The prediction problem also remains unsolved: loss ratios worsened despite AI adoption, and gene therapy ($2-4.5M treatments), NICU costs, and rare diseases remain unpredictable.

---

## Timeline

**Now → 2026:** Watch for Gradient AI Series D or acquisition rumors; Milliman lawsuit resolution. Entry points: MGUs adopting AI-native underwriting (Evolution Risk, Western Skies, Arlo model). Level-funded continues growing (targeting 50%+ in small firms). Premium increases of 9-11% accelerate employer shift to self-funded. Gene therapy carve-out products expand (BCS, Evernorth Embarc). Cigna 2025 stop-loss "tracking to expectations" after corrective actions.

**2027 → 2028:** Inflection: Does Gradient AI sign a top-5 carrier (validates larger TAM) or remain MGU-only (ceiling confirmed)? Critical threshold: If UnitedHealth/Cigna announce dedicated stop-loss AI platforms AND Gradient AI loses renewals, thesis breaks. 2-3 more carrier M&A deals expected (follow Nationwide-Allstate template). Gene therapy carve-outs standardize or remain niche. Level-funded reaches 50%+ penetration in small groups.

**2029+:** Market consolidates to 5-7 dominant carriers. MGU layer either acquired by carriers or becomes embedded infrastructure. AI underwriting commoditizes—moat is customer lock-in, not algorithms. Gradient AI exit: $300M-500M acquisition (bull) or down-round/marginalization (bear).

## Startup Opportunities

**1. AI-Native MGU Platform (Gradient AI model)**
- Why this follows: Market expansion + consolidation create demand for small group underwriting
- Wedge: Serve <500 life groups without claims history via data substitution
- Risk: Large carriers build in-house; Gradient AI already dominant; Milliman lawsuit creates precedent risk; limited TAM ceiling if carriers internalize

**2. Gene Therapy-Specific Stop-Loss (BCS model)**
- Why this follows: Structural pricing gap creates new product category
- Wedge: Carve out gene therapy risk ($2-4.5M per treatment) from traditional stop-loss; PMPM model vs. traditional reimbursement
- Risk: Frequency increases faster than pricing; adverse selection concentrates risk; only 3 gene therapy claims 2022-2024 across 2M covered lives (QBE)

**3. Level-Funded Product Infrastructure (TPA analytics)**
- Why this follows: SMB market unlock requires TPA-level analytics for groups lacking sophisticated capabilities
- Wedge: Picks-and-shovels data platform for 87% of premium controlled by incumbents lacking modern analytics
- Risk: Gradient AI expanding into TPA segment; carriers building internally; data fragmentation across TPAs

---

## Watch For

**If RIGHT:** Gradient AI acquired for $300M+ by carrier or PE. Level-funded penetration exceeds 50% in small firms (KFF 2026). 2+ more carrier M&A deals in stop-loss. Gradient AI signs a top-10 carrier (validates TAM expansion). Milliman lawsuit settled or decided in Gradient AI's favor.

**If WRONG:** UnitedHealth or Cigna announces dedicated stop-loss AI platform. Gradient AI loses 2+ major MGU renewals to carrier-internal solutions. NY-style stop-loss restrictions spread to 5+ additional states. Gradient AI down-round or exits market. Milliman lawsuit results in injunction against Gradient AI's core technology.
