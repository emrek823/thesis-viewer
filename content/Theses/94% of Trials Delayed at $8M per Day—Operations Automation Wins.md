# Thesis: 94% of Trials Delayed at $8M/Day—Operations Automation Wins

## Investment Take

Clinical trial operations is the last Excel stronghold in pharma. 94% of trials delayed >1 month, each delay costing $600K-$8M/day ([[slope-seed-pitch-deck---q4-2019-05f0f0f4]]). The industry spends $80B annually on trials while 30-50% of operations still run on spreadsheets ([[Director at a Pharmaceutical Therapeutics Company _ Greenphire _ Tegus|Greenphire Tegus]]). This is a $19B TAM hiding in plain sight.

The winners are emerging. Slope (supply chain) grew 267% YoY to $3M revenue with $2.4M TCV backlog ([[slope-series-a-pitch-deck-e7d229e2]]). Unlearn (digital twins) promises 50% cost reduction and 50% fewer control arm subjects ([[unlearnai_pitch-1-05e675e9]]). Greenphire dominates patient payments with 2M+ patients across complex multi-arm oncology trials ([[Contract Process Operations Lead, J&J Innovative Medicine at The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson _ Greenphire _ Tegus|J&J Janssen Greenphire Tegus]]).

The market is segmented by company stage. ~600 clinical-stage biotechs in the $0-500M revenue "sweet spot" are ideal targets—good science, cash runway, Phase II-III active ([[Vice President of Finance at Velocity Clinical Research _ Greenphire _ Tegus]]). Larger pharma (30%) use specialized tools, mid-market (20%) buy branded solutions, but 50% still use Excel. Government funding cuts (30-35% hit) are forcing efficiency investments.

**Why now:** Thermo Fisher's $8.875B acquisition of Clario for endpoint data signals big pharma values trial operations infrastructure ([[Thermo Fisher Scientific to Acquire Clario Holdings, Inc., Enabling Pharma and Biotech Customers to Accelerate Innovation with Deeper Clinical Insights|Thermo Fisher Clario Acquisition]]). Trial site networks consolidating. AI integration accelerating but human connection becoming differentiator ([[More 2026 Clinical Predictions]]).

**How this evolved:**
- *2025-12-21:* Emerged from source cluster: Slope (supply chain), Unlearn (digital twins), Greenphire/Auxilius (payments/accruals). Shared mechanism: trial delays = massive cost, automation = clear ROI.
- *2025-12-22:* Deep dives confirm market structure. J&J says Greenphire has "no real competitors" in patient payments—owns the space ([[Contract Process Operations Lead, J&J Innovative Medicine at The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson _ Greenphire _ Tegus]]). Expert confirms 600 clinical-stage midmarket biotechs in U.S., with 30-20-50 split (specialized/big brand/Excel). Auxilius at "10X revenue growth" ([[Director at a Pharmaceutical Therapeutics Company _ Greenphire _ Tegus]]). Each oncology patient costs ~$60K during trial—complexity creates moat.

## Bull Case

- [x] **Delays are quantified and massive.** 94% of trials delayed >1 month. $600K-$8M/day cost. Math is undeniable.
  - *Evidence:* [[slope-seed-pitch-deck---q4-2019-05f0f0f4]] — Industry data on delay costs

- [x] **Incumbents are asleep.** 50% of clinical-stage biotechs still on Excel. No dominant platform across supply chain + payments + accruals.
  - *Evidence:* [[Director at a Pharmaceutical Therapeutics Company _ Greenphire _ Tegus]] — 30-20-50 split (specialized/branded/Excel), 600 clinical-stage biotechs in U.S.

- [ ] **M&A validates category.** Thermo Fisher paid $8.875B for Clario (endpoint data). Big pharma buying operations infrastructure.
  - *Evidence:* [[Thermo Fisher Scientific to Acquire Clario Holdings, Inc., Enabling Pharma and Biotech Customers to Accelerate Innovation with Deeper Clinical Insights|Thermo Fisher Clario Acquisition]] — "immediately accretive" to EPS

## Bear Case

- [ ] **Point solutions fragment the market.** Slope does supply chain, Greenphire does payments, Auxilius does accruals. No one owns the workflow end-to-end. Could stay fragmented.
  - *Evidence:* Needs monitoring — Track consolidation M&A

- [ ] **Pharma IT buying cycles are brutal.** 9-36 month sales cycles for enterprise deals. Startups burn cash waiting.
  - *Evidence:* [[Former Vice President of Product Management at Change Healthcare _ Cohere Health _ Tegus]] — "9-36 month buying cycles"

- [ ] **CROs bundle operations.** If IQVIA, PPD, Parexel build native automation, standalone startups lose distribution.
  - *Evidence:* Needs monitoring — Track CRO platform announcements

## Startup Opportunities

**1. Trial Supply Chain (Slope model)**
- Real-time inventory tracking, reducing $600K-$8M/day delay costs
- Why this follows: 2.1K+ trials managed, 276 sites, 267% YoY growth proves demand
- Wedge: Early-phase trials (Phase I/II) where sponsors control more
- Risk: Late-phase dominated by CROs with own systems

**2. Digital Twins for Control Arms (Unlearn model)**
- ML-generated synthetic control arms reducing enrollment by 50%
- Why this follows: Phase costs ($7M Phase I, $20M Phase II, $53M Phase III) make 50% reduction compelling
- Wedge: FDA acceptance of external control arms in specific indications
- Risk: Regulatory uncertainty on synthetic data acceptance

**3. Trial Finance Platform (Auxilius/Condor model)**
- Accrual automation, investigator forecasting, scenario modeling
- Why this follows: 600 clinical-stage biotechs in sweet spot, mostly on Excel
- Wedge: SMB biotechs ($0-500M) underserved by enterprise solutions
- Risk: Market fragmented, hard to build network effects

## Open Questions

**Will one platform consolidate trial ops?**
→ OPEN: If Slope or similar expands from supply chain to payments to accruals, could become trial ops OS. If stays fragmented, smaller exits.

**How does FDA view synthetic control arms?**
→ OPEN: If FDA signals acceptance of digital twins, Unlearn model scales. If RCT required, limited to rare disease/oncology.

**Do CROs build or buy?**
→ OPEN: If IQVIA acquires trial ops startups, validates category but caps upside. If they build internally, threat to standalone players.
