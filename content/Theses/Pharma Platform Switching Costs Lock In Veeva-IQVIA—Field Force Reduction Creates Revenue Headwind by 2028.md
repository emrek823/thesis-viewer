## The Take

**$4.3B pharma CRM market growing to $9.9B by 2034**—and the September 2025 Veeva-Salesforce split created the first real competitive shake-up in a decade. Veeva owns ~80% market share, but Salesforce Life Sciences Cloud just landed Takeda and partnered with IQVIA to compete directly.

**Mechanism:** Pharma switching costs are prohibitive (1+ month training for 2,000-person field forces creates "change management nightmare") → incumbents locked in → but Salesforce entry + mandatory Vault migration by 2030 creates a decision point where 200+ pharma companies must actively choose their platform.

**Outcome:** Platform consolidation accelerates. Winners are companies that capture the forced migration window. The real risk is not field force reduction (Veeva is growing 16%+ despite layoffs) but Salesforce competitive pressure forcing price concessions.

## Investment Take

**Today:** The consensus says Veeva is a monopolist with unassailable switching costs. The contrarian view: **the Salesforce entry in September 2025 is the first real competitive threat in a decade, and the mandatory Vault migration creates a rare decision point**.

Three dynamics define the opportunity:

1. **Switching costs are real but work both ways.** "Changing CRM systems with 2,000-person field forces requires 1+ month training" and "only justified for game-changing technology." But Veeva's mandatory migration to Vault CRM by 2030 forces every customer to re-evaluate anyway. That's 200+ pharma companies making active platform decisions for the first time in years.

2. **Field force reduction is NOT creating the expected headwind.** Per-rep licensing was supposed to create structural revenue decline as field forces shrink 20-30% post-COVID. Instead, Veeva grew 16-17% in FY2026, achieved $3B revenue run rate, and is targeting $6B by 2030. Digital engagement modules (MSL tools, omnichannel marketing) are offsetting headcount-based revenue decline.

3. **Salesforce is now a real competitor.** The non-compete expired September 2025. Salesforce launched Life Sciences Cloud with IQVIA partnership. Takeda signed in May 2025. This is the first credible competitive threat since Veeva was founded.

**The mechanism:** Switching costs lock customers in → but mandatory Vault migration + Salesforce entry create decision windows → pharma companies have first real choice in a decade → competition forces innovation and price pressure.

**The IQVIA angle is WRONG:** The original thesis predicted Veeva-IQVIA merger or acquisition. Instead, they settled all lawsuits in August 2025 and formed a partnership. IQVIA is now a Veeva partner, not a merger target. IQVIA partnered with Salesforce to compete against Veeva.

**In 3-5 years:**

- **Winners:** Salesforce Life Sciences Cloud if they execute (IQVIA partnership gives data advantage). Veeva if they retain customers through Vault migration. Digital engagement platforms that work across both ecosystems.
- **Losers:** Oracle (legacy, declining). Small point solutions caught between platform giants.
- **Market structure:** Duopoly (Veeva + Salesforce) replaces monopoly. Competition drives faster innovation. Pricing pressure emerges.

**How this evolved:**
- *2026-01-10:* Auto-generated from /new-thesis clustering of 8 Tegus expert interviews
- *2026-01-26:* **REBUILD** — Contrarian pressure test. Original "revenue headwind" thesis proven WRONG: Veeva grew 16-17% in FY2026, achieved $3B run rate. M&A thesis also wrong: Veeva-IQVIA settled lawsuits, formed partnership (not merger). Real risk is Salesforce competition, not field force reduction. Biggest threat: Salesforce landed Takeda in May 2025.

## Bull Case

- [x] **Switching costs are prohibitive** — "changing CRM systems with 2,000-person field forces requires 1+ month training" ([[tegus_veeva-systems-inc_22536]])
- [x] **Consolidation to fewer vendors** — "Pharma consolidates to fewer vendors rather than piecing together best-of-breed" ([[tegus_veeva-systems-inc_38591]])
- [x] **MSL programs expand** — Medical science liaisons become primary HCP touchpoint as field reps decline; 58% of HCPs rate MSL interactions more valuable than sales reps ([[tegus_veeva-systems-inc_52800]])
- [x] **Veeva revenue accelerating despite field cuts** — FY2026: 16-17% YoY growth, $3B revenue run rate achieved, targeting $6B by 2030 (WebSearch: Veeva Q3 2026 earnings)
- [x] **Platform lock-in validated** — Gilead spends $10-12M/year on clinical, $15M on quality, $12-15M on regulatory; evaluating alternatives but "no good competitive options" for CTMS/eTMF ([[tegus_veeva-systems-inc_86838_senior-director-head-of-clinic-54a485e7]])
- [ ] **Vault migration creates stickiness** — Mandatory migration to Vault CRM by 2030 means customers already committed to Veeva ecosystem

---

## Bear Case

- [x] **Salesforce is now competing directly** — Life Sciences Cloud launched Sept 2025; Takeda signed May 2025; IQVIA partnership gives data advantage (WebSearch: Salesforce Life Sciences Cloud)
- [x] **Customer dissatisfaction is real** — "Veeva is heading in the same direction as Oracle... they failed to take users' input into the roadmap"; sponsors feel product built for CROs not sponsors ([[tegus_veeva-systems-inc_86838_senior-director-head-of-clinic-54a485e7]])
- [x] **Pricing model frustrates sponsors** — R&D-based pricing means sponsors "pay twice" (direct + embedded in CRO contracts); 7-environment limit forces additional $25K/month costs ([[tegus_veeva-systems-inc_86838_senior-director-head-of-clinic-54a485e7]])
- [x] **IQVIA has better KOL tools** — "IQVIA really has one of the better ones... Veeva, they're not good at it" on KOL identification and mapping ([[tegus_iqvia-holdings-inc_37781]])
- [ ] **Vault migration is execution risk** — 200+ customers must migrate by 2030; any stumbles create Salesforce opportunity

## The Counter Thesis

The strongest counter-argument is that **Salesforce Life Sciences Cloud will win meaningful market share during the Vault migration window**.

**For this thesis to be right (switching costs hold):**
- Veeva executes flawless Vault migrations for 200+ customers
- Salesforce fails to sign more Top-20 pharma beyond Takeda
- Customer complaints don't translate to actual churn

**For this thesis to be wrong (Salesforce wins):**
- Salesforce signs 3+ Top-20 pharma in next 2 years
- Vault migration creates significant customer friction
- IQVIA data integration gives Salesforce meaningful feature advantage

**Response:** Switching costs remain the dominant factor. Even dissatisfied customers like Gilead say "there are no good competitive options" for core clinical modules. Salesforce must prove its pharma-specific functionality, not just CRM capabilities. But the competitive pressure is real for the first time.

---

## Timeline

**Now → 2026:** Vault CRM migrations begin. Watch for: Salesforce signing additional Top-20 pharma, Veeva customer retention rates, pricing pressure evidence.

**2027 → 2028:** Peak migration period (most customers migrate 2026-2029). If Salesforce gains 10%+ share, thesis weakens significantly. If Veeva retains 75%+ through migration, switching costs validated.

**2029+:** Post-migration steady state. Market structure solidifies into Veeva-Salesforce duopoly or Veeva maintains near-monopoly.

## Startup Opportunities

**1. Cross-Platform Integration Layer**
- Why this follows: Salesforce entry means pharma will have split ecosystems for first time
- Wedge: Data integration, workflow orchestration across Veeva and Salesforce instances
- Risk: Both platforms build native integrations

**2. AI-Native HCP Engagement**
- Why this follows: Digital engagement replacing field force but legacy platforms (including Veeva) struggle with AI
- Wedge: Next-gen rep tools that work across CRM platforms
- Risk: Veeva/Salesforce AI investments close gap

**3. Specialty Pharma Commercial Stack**
- Why this follows: Rare disease/specialty pharma have different needs than Top-20 (smaller field forces, different workflows)
- Wedge: Purpose-built for specialty, not scaled-down enterprise
- Risk: Veeva already targeting small/mid-size with affordable per-seat pricing

---

## Watch For

**If RIGHT (switching costs hold):**
- Veeva retains 90%+ of customers through Vault migration
- Salesforce fails to sign additional Top-20 pharma in 2026
- Veeva continues 15%+ revenue growth

**If WRONG (Salesforce wins):**
- Salesforce signs 3+ Top-20 pharma by end of 2027
- Veeva revenue growth slows to <10%
- Vault migration creates customer churn
- IQVIA-Salesforce integration proves compelling
