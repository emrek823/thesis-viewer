# Thesis: Specialty Drug Economics Favor Vertical Integrators—340B, Biosimilars, and Prior Auth Consolidate by 2028

## Investment Take

**Consensus believes:** Specialty drug economics are fragmented opportunities. 340B is a policy issue. Biosimilars need better software to show margin-positive switches. Prior auth needs AI automation. Each is a separate startup wedge.

**Actually:** Vertical integrators are capturing specialty drug economics across ALL three mechanisms simultaneously:

1. **Biosimilars captured via private labels + practice ownership.** PBMs shifted to private-label biosimilars (Cordavis, Quallent, Nuvaila)—"nearly all marketed Humira biosimilars are excluded" from 2025 formularies. Wholesaler-MSOs spent $16B+ acquiring physician practices. They don't need software because they OWN the prescribing decision point.

2. **340B stratifies by capital access.** The rebate pilot shifts from upfront discount to 10-day rebate timing. Non-profit hospitals can float the cash; FQHCs cannot. "Cash-strapped clinics lacked the resources to 'float' the funds"—creating regulatory-driven stratification that favors capital-rich integrators.

3. **Pharmacy prior auth is automatable; medical is not.** "It's easier in pharmacy than medical for AI clearance." Specialty infusion has serial authorization patterns ("you give this medication six times over six weeks"). The vendors that win here (Plenful, Latent, Mandolin) serve 340B participants—who are the same vertical integrators.

**The unified mechanism:** Specialty drugs are 50%+ of drug spending but only 2% of prescriptions. The economics are concentrated where integrators can capture them: formulary control (PBMs), practice ownership (wholesaler-MSOs), and automation (prior auth AI). Standalone software loses because the decision points are owned. Cash-poor safety net providers lose because they can't float capital.

**In 5-10 years:**
- **Winners:** CVS, Cigna, UNH, McKesson, Cardinal, Cencora; pharmacy-first prior auth AI vendors that serve integrators; capital providers who bridge 340B timing
- **Losers:** Independent biosimilar manufacturers, standalone analytics vendors, cash-constrained FQHCs, pure-play medical prior auth AI without pharmacy foundation
- **Market structure:** Top 3 PBMs (80% share) + Top 3 wholesalers (90% share) capture specialty drug value chain. Independent specialty practices acquired or marginalized. Pharmacy AI prior auth achieves 70-80% automation; medical remains 30-50% with human oversight.

**How this evolved:**
- *2025-12-27:* Biosimilar thesis flipped after scanning 31 sources—software play is weak when decision points are owned
- *2026-01-02:* 340B thesis rebuilt to focus on capital stratification mechanism
- *2026-01-02:* Prior auth thesis rebuilt showing pharmacy leads, medical lags
- *2026-01-07:* **MERGED** — Three theses combined under unified "vertical integrators capture specialty drug economics" frame

## Mechanism

### 1. Biosimilars: Private Labels + Practice Ownership

**PBMs captured pharmacy-side biosimilars:**
- "Nearly all marketed Humira biosimilars are excluded" from 2025 formularies
- Each PBM favors own private label: Cordavis (CVS), Quallent (Cigna), Nuvaila (UNH)
- Adalimumab: 2% to 23% in 12 months when integrators pushed conversion

**Wholesaler-MSOs captured buy-and-bill:**
- Big 3 spent $16B+ on MSO acquisitions
- They capture 3-5x margins by steering biosimilars through owned practices
- McKesson acquiring Core Ventures for $2.49B (Dec 2025); FTC did not block

**Why software loses:**
- Solstice built exactly this tool; major health system CRO was "ambivalent"
- Vertical integrators don't need software—they OWN the prescribing decision point

### 2. 340B: Capital Stratification

**Rebate timing creates capital burden:**
- Rebate pilot shifts from upfront discount to 10-day rebate timing
- Providers must purchase at WAC (full price), then wait 10+ days for rebate
- For 10 IRA-negotiated drugs alone, this is substantial capital

**Non-profit hospitals can absorb it:**
- "Greater cash reserves," "access to credit," "economies of scale"
- The 10-day float is manageable for integrated systems

**FQHCs and public hospitals cannot:**
- "Face tight budgets and depend heavily on Medicaid"
- "Far fewer resources available to cope with waiting for the 340B discount"
- Congressional history: Original program changed FROM rebate TO upfront discount specifically because "cash-strapped clinics lacked resources to 'float' the funds"

### 3. Prior Auth: Pharmacy Leads, Medical Lags

**Pharmacy prior auth is structurally easier:**
- LifePoint CMIO: "It's easier in pharmacy than it is on AI for you to get a clearance to do a diagnostic study"
- Cleaner data, clearer eligibility signals, fewer edge cases

**Specialty infusions have automatable patterns:**
- "You get one injectable. Oftentimes, it's a series of four, sometimes six"—predictable sequences
- Serial authorization patterns enable 70-80% automation

**340B creates concentration:**
- Organizations participating in 340B "absolutely need" vendors like Plenful, Latent, or Mandolin
- Same integrators who capture biosimilar economics capture prior auth automation

**Medical prior auth remains human-dependent:**
- Agentic AI for medical workflows requires "hospital-defined rules and risk caps" and "human-in-the-loop controls"
- Not autonomous operation

## Bull Case

### Biosimilar Capture
- [x] **PBMs captured pharmacy-side biosimilars via private labels.** "Nearly all marketed Humira biosimilars are excluded" from 2025 formularies ([[2025-12-23-the-big-three-pbms-2025-formulary-exclusions-humir]])
- [x] **Wholesaler-MSOs capturing buy-and-bill via practice ownership.** Big 3 spent $16B+ on MSO acquisitions ([[The Future of Buy-and-Bill Market Access Five Drivers of Wholesalers' Vertical Integration with Physician Practices]])
- [x] **Market highly concentrated.** "Top four specialty pharmacies have 75% market share, top 3 wholesalers have more than 90% market share, top 3 PBMs have 80% market share" ([[specialty-pharma-autoimmune-ba34628610be40a1b149b83ea01983cc-cea8df03]])

### 340B Stratification
- [x] **340B rebate pilot launches Jan 2026.** 8 of 10 IRA-negotiated drug manufacturers approved ([[The 340B Rebate Pilot Model Weighing 340B Program Integrity Against Financial Stability For The Safety Net  Health Affairs Forefront]])
- [x] **FQHCs structurally disadvantaged.** "Federal grantees typically face tight budgets...have far fewer resources available to cope with waiting for the 340B discount for ten days" ([[The 340B Rebate Pilot Model Weighing 340B Program Integrity Against Financial Stability For The Safety Net  Health Affairs Forefront]])
- [x] **Congressional history confirms risk.** Original program "was subsequently changed to an upfront discount to minimize this financial risk to its safety net providers" ([[The 340B Rebate Pilot Model Weighing 340B Program Integrity Against Financial Stability For The Safety Net  Health Affairs Forefront]])

### Prior Auth Automation
- [x] **Pharmacy prior auth is structurally easier.** LifePoint CMIO: "It's easier in pharmacy than it is on AI for you to get a clearance to do a diagnostic study" ([[Chief Medical Informatics Officer (CMIO), VP & AI_RCM_CDI Physician Executive at LifePoint Health _ Plenful _ Tegus]])
- [x] **340B creates forcing function.** "If we did [340B], that would be an absolute indication that you need one of these vendors" ([[Chief Medical Informatics Officer (CMIO), VP & AI_RCM_CDI Physician Executive at LifePoint Health _ Plenful _ Tegus]])
- [x] **Serial infusion patterns are automatable.** Predictable sequences enable high automation rates ([[Chief Medical Informatics Officer (CMIO), VP & AI_RCM_CDI Physician Executive at LifePoint Health _ Plenful _ Tegus]])

---

## Bear Case

- [ ] **FTC blocks further MSO consolidation.** If regulators intervene on future acquisitions, independent software could still win
- [ ] **Pharmacy → medical expansion unproven.** "These types of tools have scratched the surface of where AI for prior auth is going"
- [ ] **CVS breakup creates market structure change.** If CVS spins off PBM, could create independent PBM willing to work with independent biosimilar manufacturers
- [ ] **Transparency regulation enables insurgents.** If CMS mandates real-time pricing data, software companies can compete on information parity
- [ ] **10-day 340B window may be manageable.** Many entities already use "virtual inventory models" with WAC upfront purchase
- [x] **Provider value prop not compelling.** Solstice built exactly this tool; major health system CRO was "ambivalent" ([[copy-of-running-meeting-notes---virtue-_-solstice-7f69e007]])

**The counter-thesis:** Vertical integration becomes an antitrust target. FTC breaks up PBM-payer combinations or mandates pharmacy pass-through pricing. 340B pilot gets rolled back due to FQHC harm. Independent biosimilar manufacturers gain formulary access. Software becomes the neutral layer enabling price discovery.

---

## Timeline

**Now → 2026:**
- 340B rebate pilot expands; cash flow impact on FQHCs becomes visible
- Private-label biosimilars dominate 2025-2026 formularies
- Stelara biosimilar launch—watch whether independents get formulary access
- AI prior auth startups demonstrate 70-80% automation in pharmacy

**2027 → 2028:**
- 30-40 biosimilar launches expected (FDA regulatory tailwinds)
- IRA drug price negotiation expands to Part B (2028)
- Prior auth AI becomes standard for commercial payers
- Critical mass of MSO-owned practices reached in key markets
- Inflection: If independent manufacturers <15% market share, thesis confirmed

**2029+:**
- PBM private labels become default across pharmacy benefit
- Wholesaler-MSOs control majority of buy-and-bill volume
- Remaining independent specialty practices acquired or marginalized
- Pharmacy AI prior auth achieves 70-80% automation; medical remains 30-50%
- 340B financing becomes embedded in 340B administration

## Startup Opportunities

### Serve the Integrators (Not Compete)
**1. Get Acquired by Wholesaler-MSO**
- Why this follows: Big 3 spending $16B+ on MSO consolidation; may buy rather than build analytics
- Wedge: Build biosimilar steering analytics, prove ROI at single MSO, position for acqui-hire
- Risk: Acqui-hire valuations are low; they may build in-house

**2. 340B Float Financing**
- Why this follows: Rebate timing shift disadvantages cash-poor FQHCs; they need capital bridge
- Wedge: Partner with 340B administrators; provide instant rebate advances for modest fee
- Risk: HRSA intervention; 340B program changes; limited FQHC market size

**3. Pharmacy-First Prior Auth AI**
- Why this follows: Pharmacy is automatable; 340B creates forcing function for vendor adoption
- Wedge: Start with specialty infusion where patterns are predictable; expand to broader pharmacy
- Risk: Incumbents add AI features; need to serve integrators not compete with them

### Data Plays
**4. Biosimilar Outcomes Registry**
- Why this follows: FDA accepting RWD; manufacturers need post-marketing data to defend formulary position
- Wedge: Track conversions at independent practices, prove non-inferiority, monetize RWE data ($100K-500K per molecule)
- Risk: 3-5 years before data valuable; integrators may build own registries

---

## Watch For

**If RIGHT (thesis plays out):**
- PBM private-label biosimilars exceed 60% market share by 2026
- FQHC complaints about 340B rebate timing in industry press
- Independent biosimilar manufacturers exit market or consolidate
- Wholesaler-MSO owned practices exceed 40% of specialty volume
- Standalone biosimilar/prior auth analytics companies fail to raise Series B or pivot to serving integrators
- Health systems announce prior auth staff reductions with AI replacement

**If WRONG (thesis fails):**
- FTC blocks PBM-payer combinations or mandates unbundling
- CMS transparency rules give independents pricing parity
- 340B pilot rolled back due to documented FQHC harm
- Independent biosimilar manufacturer reaches 25%+ market share
- Software-only company achieves $50M+ ARR without integrator partnership
- Medical prior auth automation reaches pharmacy-level rates (70%+)

## Open Questions

**Will CVS breakup create market structure change?**
→ OPEN: If CVS spins off PBM, could create independent PBM willing to work with independent biosimilar manufacturers. Watch Q1-Q2 2025 announcements.

**Can independents aggregate before acquisition wave completes?**
→ OPEN: If <1,000 independent specialty practices remain by 2026, virtual GPO TAM too small.

**Will 340B pilot expand beyond IRA-negotiated drugs?**
→ OPEN: If pilot remains limited, stratification is modest and financing opportunity is narrow.
