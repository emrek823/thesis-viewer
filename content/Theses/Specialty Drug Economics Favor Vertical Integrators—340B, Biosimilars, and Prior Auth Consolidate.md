# Thesis: Specialty Drug Economics Favor Vertical Integrators—340B, Biosimilars, and Prior Auth Consolidate by 2028

## Investment Take

**Consensus believes:** Specialty drug economics are fragmented opportunities. 340B is a policy issue. Biosimilars need better software to show margin-positive switches. Prior auth needs AI automation. Each is a separate startup wedge.

**Actually:** Vertical integrators are capturing specialty drug economics across ALL three mechanisms simultaneously—and the 340B cash cow is being systematically squeezed while prior auth AI has already been captured by well-funded winners:

1. **Biosimilars captured via private labels + practice ownership.** PBMs shifted to private-label biosimilars (Cordavis, Quallent, Nuvaila)—"nearly all marketed Humira biosimilars are excluded" from 2025 formularies. Wholesaler-MSOs spent $16B+ acquiring physician practices. They don't need software because they OWN the prescribing decision point.

2. **340B is being squeezed from five directions simultaneously.** Manufacturer restrictions ($3.2B annual losses), rebate model assault (paused by AHA lawsuit), CMS oversight shift (HRSA to CMS), IRA list price compression (deflates the spread), and coverage doom loop. The $66B gross-to-net pool will shrink, concentrate among fewer players, and become harder to capture.

3. **Prior auth AI market already captured—but specialty pharmacy, not infusion.** Latent ($50M Series B, 25+ health systems) owns specialty pharmacy PA (Part D). Mandolin ($57M raised) is stuck in infusion (Part B)—hasn't cracked a single health system because "specialty is where all the money is." Tandem ($7M seed) is different: pharma-funded, provider-side. Market is "wide open" but switching costs are extreme once vendor implemented ("would need an act of God to switch").

**The unified mechanism:** Specialty drugs are 50%+ of drug spending but only 2% of prescriptions. The economics are concentrated where integrators can capture them: formulary control (PBMs), practice ownership (wholesaler-MSOs), and automation (prior auth AI). Standalone software loses because the decision points are owned. Cash-poor safety net providers lose because they can't float capital.

**CRITICAL INSIGHT (from CPO interviews):** The best startup entry point isn't PA automation—it's front-end analytics. "If you equip a chief pharmacy officer to walk into the C-suite and say 'we have a $50M opportunity and we're only capturing $20M,' they're going to love you." Willingness to pay for specialty pharmacy analytics alone: **$400-500K/year**. No one does this well today.

**In 5-10 years:**
- **Winners:** CVS, Cigna, UNH, McKesson, Cardinal, Cencora; Latent (owns specialty pharmacy PA); health systems that build owned specialty pharmacies; analytics-first startups that create the business case for investment
- **Losers:** Independent biosimilar manufacturers, pure 340B software (pool shrinking), Mandolin-like infusion plays (wrong market), late entrants to PA automation (lock-in too strong), cash-constrained FQHCs
- **Market structure:** Top 3 PBMs (80% share) + Top 3 wholesalers (90% share) capture specialty drug value chain. 340B economics compress but don't disappear. Prior auth consolidates to 2-3 platforms per segment.

**How this evolved:**
- *2025-12-27:* Biosimilar thesis flipped after scanning 31 sources—software play is weak when decision points are owned
- *2026-01-02:* 340B thesis rebuilt to focus on capital stratification mechanism
- *2026-01-02:* Prior auth thesis rebuilt showing pharmacy leads, medical lags
- *2026-01-07:* **MERGED** — Three theses combined under unified "vertical integrators capture specialty drug economics" frame
- *2026-01-08:* **REBUILD** — Deep dive on 340B threats (5 vectors), prior auth competitive landscape (Latent vs Mandolin vs Tandem), CPO interviews revealing analytics-first entry point

## Mechanism

### 1. Biosimilars: Private Labels + Practice Ownership

**PBMs captured pharmacy-side biosimilars:**
- "Nearly all marketed Humira biosimilars are excluded" from 2025 formularies
- Each PBM favors own private label: Cordavis (CVS), Quallent (Cigna), Nuvaila (UNH)
- Adalimumab: 2% to 23% in 12 months when integrators pushed conversion

**Wholesaler-MSOs captured buy-and-bill:**
- Big 3 spent $16B+ on MSO acquisitions
- They capture 3-5x margins by steering biosimilars through owned practices
- McKesson acquiring Core Ventures for $2.49B (Dec 2025); FTC did not block

**Why software loses:**
- Solstice built exactly this tool; major health system CRO was "ambivalent"
- Vertical integrators don't need software—they OWN the prescribing decision point

### 2. 340B: Five-Vector Squeeze (Not Dead, But Shrinking)

The $66B gross-to-net pool isn't disappearing overnight, but it's being eroded from multiple directions simultaneously.

**Threat 1: Manufacturer Restrictions ($3.2B Annual Losses)**
- 39 manufacturers now restrict 340B pricing for contract pharmacy arrangements
- Eli Lilly started July 2020; now industry standard
- 1 in 3 critical access hospitals have cut services due to lost 340B savings
- D.C. Circuit and Third Circuit both upheld manufacturers' rights—statute silent on distribution conditions

**Threat 2: Rebate Model Assault (Paused)**
- Five manufacturers proposed replacing upfront discounts with 10-day rebates
- 93% of hospitals surveyed couldn't maintain current uncompensated care levels
- Federal judge blocked HRSA's rebate model pilot December 2025 (AHA lawsuit)
- Original program switched FROM rebates TO upfront discounts because "cash-strapped clinics lacked resources to 'float' the funds"

**Threat 3: CMS Oversight Shift**
- Trump FY2026 budget proposes moving 340B from HRSA to CMS
- CMS cut Medicare 340B drug reimbursement by 30% in 2018 (overturned on administrative grounds)
- CMS surveying hospital acquisition costs Q1 2026—precursor to payment cuts
- CMS "remedy" clawback: 0.5%/year to recoup $7.8B from 2018-2022

**Threat 4: IRA List Price Compression**
- Maximum Fair Prices (MFPs) for negotiated drugs compress the spread
- 10 drugs effective January 2026, 15 more in 2027-2028, 20 more 2029+
- As list prices drop, 340B ceiling prices drop proportionally
- Drug Channels: "A pharmacy earning $30 on a drug with $600 WAC would earn only $10 if WAC dropped to $200"

**Threat 5: Capital Stratification**
- Non-profit hospitals can float cash; FQHCs cannot
- 48% of rural hospitals operated at a loss in 2023
- 196 rural hospital closures 2005-2024
- Program benefits increasingly accrue to well-capitalized entities

**Net Assessment:**
| Factor | Direction | Impact |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Manufacturer restrictions | Negative | -$3.2B/year now |
| Rebate model (if resumed) | Negative | Existential for FQHCs |
| CMS oversight | Negative | Payment cuts 2027+ |
| IRA compression | Negative | Growing each year |
| State protection laws | Partial offset | 22+ states active |

### 3. Prior Auth AI: Market Captured, But Specialty > Infusion

**The Competitive Landscape (January 2026):**

| Company | Model | Focus | Traction | Funding | Assessment |
|---------|-------|-------|----------|---------|------------|
| **Latent** | Health system PA | Specialty pharmacy (Part D) | 25+ health systems (Yale, Ochsner, Northwestern) | $50M Series B | **WINNER** |
| **Mandolin** | Infusion PA | Part B infusion | 700+ clinics; NO health systems | $57M total | Wrong market |
| **Tandem** | Pharma-funded | Provider-side branded drugs | 1,035 providers | $7M seed | Different game |
| **Plenful** | Health system PA | Benefits investigation + PA | ~2 health systems | Unknown | Late entrant |

**CRITICAL INSIGHT: Specialty pharmacy is 2-3x infusion revenue.**

Cone Health CPO explicitly chose Latent over Mandolin: "Mandolin's product was really focused in the infusion space. Part B benefit, where specialty is all out Part D. **Where we knew the money was specialty.** When our IT teams like, 'We can only get one of these done in the next year, which one do you want?' It was we're obviously going to go at Latent because **that's where the revenues are.**"

**Why Mandolin is stuck:**
- Infusion is decentralized across departments (not centralized under pharmacy)
- Staff doing infusion PA don't report to pharmacy ("frankly, they didn't all give a shit")
- Harder to show ROI because you're not reducing YOUR FTEs
- Specialty pharmacy is 2-3x the revenue of non-oncology infusion

**Switching costs are extreme:**
- "Would need an act of God to switch" once Latent implemented
- IT bandwidth and AI governance boards create 1+ year implementation cycles
- CPOs fought to bring Latent in; won't go through that battle twice
- Market "wide open" but once you're in, you're in

**Epic is the elephant in the room:**
- Epic building competing LLM solutions for PA automation
- Northwestern IT Pharmacist: "Epic is working on their own... but they're behind"
- If Epic ships native, it's "almost free" for Epic shops

**CPO ego problem:**
- CPOs measure success by FTE count, not efficiency
- "How many positions you have is how we brag"
- Resistance to automation that reduces headcount
- "To convince them that reducing FTEs is interesting... is a mind shift most CPOs aren't ready for"

## Bull Case

### Biosimilar Capture
- [x] **PBMs captured pharmacy-side biosimilars via private labels.** "Nearly all marketed Humira biosimilars are excluded" from 2025 formularies ([[2025-12-23-the-big-three-pbms-2025-formulary-exclusions-humir]])
- [x] **Wholesaler-MSOs capturing buy-and-bill via practice ownership.** Big 3 spent $16B+ on MSO acquisitions ([[The Future of Buy-and-Bill Market Access Five Drivers of Wholesalers' Vertical Integration with Physician Practices]])
- [x] **Market highly concentrated.** "Top four specialty pharmacies have 75% market share, top 3 wholesalers have more than 90% market share, top 3 PBMs have 80% market share" ([[specialty-pharma-autoimmune-ba34628610be40a1b149b83ea01983cc-cea8df03]])

### 340B Stratification
- [x] **340B rebate pilot launches Jan 2026.** 8 of 10 IRA-negotiated drug manufacturers approved ([[The 340B Rebate Pilot Model Weighing 340B Program Integrity Against Financial Stability For The Safety Net  Health Affairs Forefront]])
- [x] **FQHCs structurally disadvantaged.** "Federal grantees typically face tight budgets...have far fewer resources available to cope with waiting for the 340B discount for ten days" ([[The 340B Rebate Pilot Model Weighing 340B Program Integrity Against Financial Stability For The Safety Net  Health Affairs Forefront]])
- [x] **Congressional history confirms risk.** Original program "was subsequently changed to an upfront discount to minimize this financial risk to its safety net providers" ([[The 340B Rebate Pilot Model Weighing 340B Program Integrity Against Financial Stability For The Safety Net  Health Affairs Forefront]])

### Prior Auth Automation
- [x] **Pharmacy prior auth is structurally easier.** LifePoint CMIO: "It's easier in pharmacy than it is on AI for you to get a clearance to do a diagnostic study" ([[Chief Medical Informatics Officer (CMIO), VP & AI_RCM_CDI Physician Executive at LifePoint Health _ Plenful _ Tegus]])
- [x] **340B creates forcing function.** "If we did [340B], that would be an absolute indication that you need one of these vendors" ([[Chief Medical Informatics Officer (CMIO), VP & AI_RCM_CDI Physician Executive at LifePoint Health _ Plenful _ Tegus]])
- [x] **Serial infusion patterns are automatable.** Predictable sequences enable high automation rates ([[Chief Medical Informatics Officer (CMIO), VP & AI_RCM_CDI Physician Executive at LifePoint Health _ Plenful _ Tegus]])

---

## Bear Case

- [ ] **FTC blocks further MSO consolidation.** If regulators intervene on future acquisitions, independent software could still win
- [ ] **Pharmacy → medical expansion unproven.** "These types of tools have scratched the surface of where AI for prior auth is going"
- [ ] **CVS breakup creates market structure change.** If CVS spins off PBM, could create independent PBM willing to work with independent biosimilar manufacturers
- [ ] **Transparency regulation enables insurgents.** If CMS mandates real-time pricing data, software companies can compete on information parity
- [ ] **10-day 340B window may be manageable.** Many entities already use "virtual inventory models" with WAC upfront purchase
- [x] **Provider value prop not compelling.** Solstice built exactly this tool; major health system CRO was "ambivalent" ([[copy-of-running-meeting-notes---virtue-_-solstice-7f69e007]])

**The counter-thesis:** Vertical integration becomes an antitrust target. FTC breaks up PBM-payer combinations or mandates pharmacy pass-through pricing. 340B pilot gets rolled back due to FQHC harm. Independent biosimilar manufacturers gain formulary access. Software becomes the neutral layer enabling price discovery.

---

## Timeline

**Now → 2026:**
- 340B rebate pilot expands; cash flow impact on FQHCs becomes visible
- Private-label biosimilars dominate 2025-2026 formularies
- Stelara biosimilar launch—watch whether independents get formulary access
- AI prior auth startups demonstrate 70-80% automation in pharmacy

**2027 → 2028:**
- 30-40 biosimilar launches expected (FDA regulatory tailwinds)
- IRA drug price negotiation expands to Part B (2028)
- Prior auth AI becomes standard for commercial payers
- Critical mass of MSO-owned practices reached in key markets
- Inflection: If independent manufacturers <15% market share, thesis confirmed

**2029+:**
- PBM private labels become default across pharmacy benefit
- Wholesaler-MSOs control majority of buy-and-bill volume
- Remaining independent specialty practices acquired or marginalized
- Pharmacy AI prior auth achieves 70-80% automation; medical remains 30-50%
- 340B financing becomes embedded in 340B administration

## Startup Opportunities

### What MAKES SENSE

**1. Specialty Pharmacy Analytics / Leakage Identification (HIGHEST CONVICTION)**
- Why this follows: CPO would pay $400-500K just for this. Creates business case for all other investments.
- What it is: Real-time dashboard showing opportunity—what's leaking to external pharmacies, which physicians aren't capturing scripts, margin opportunity by drug/payer/clinic
- Why no one's built it: Requires deep Epic/Willow integration, health systems configured differently, not as sexy as "AI PA automation"
- Wedge: Start with analytics that equip CPO to walk into C-suite with specific dollar opportunity, then layer on PA automation
- Risk: Epic could build natively; requires deep EHR integration investment

**2. Provider-Side PA Automation (Tandem Model)**
- Why this follows: Different customer (providers), different payer (pharma), lower switching costs
- What it is: Pharma-funded PA automation distributed to prescribers via EHR
- Tandem has neuro/derm; could target oncology, cardiology, endocrinology
- Risk: Tandem has $7M raised and first-mover in pharma relationships

**3. Specialty Pharmacy Build/Operate Services (NOT Software)**
- Why this follows: Software loses to ownership. Services enable ownership.
- What it is: Help health systems build and operate owned specialty pharmacies—accreditation, compliance, launch, ongoing management
- VytlOne/ProxsysRx validates: $750-1000/bed/month
- Risk: Service-heavy, harder to scale, competes with consulting firms

**4. Manufacturer Restriction Navigation**
- Why this follows: #1 unmet need per KLAS is "help navigating manufacturer restrictions"
- What it is: Real-time tracking of 39+ manufacturer policies, claims routing optimization, compliance automation
- Risk: Could be a feature, not a company; Sentry/Kalderos may build

### What DOES NOT Make Sense

**1. Infusion-Only PA Automation (Competing with Mandolin)**
- Specialty pharmacy is 2-3x the money
- Mandolin has $57M raised and still hasn't cracked health systems
- CPO explicitly deprioritized: "we're obviously going to go at Latent because that's where the revenues are"

**2. Pure PA Automation for Health Systems (Competing with Latent)**
- Latent has first-mover with lighthouse accounts (Yale, Ochsner, Mt. Sinai)
- $50M raised, General Catalyst backing
- Extreme switching costs: "would need an act of God to switch"
- Epic building competing solutions

**3. Pure 340B Savings Maximization**
- The pool is shrinking (5 vectors of attack)
- Vertical integrators capturing remaining value through ownership
- Software loses to ownership
- Incumbents (Sentry, Kalderos) own compliance layer

**4. Biosimilar Adoption Software**
- 340B hospitals incentivized NOT to adopt biosimilars (larger spread on branded)
- PBM rebate walls are real gatekeeper
- Vertical integrators already captured the economics

**5. Practice Spend Card + Rx Marketplace (Nitra Model)**
- Nitra expanding into specialty Rx via "Nitra Mart Rx"—Avastin ($500K/year per retina practice), GLP-1s (Ozempic, Mounjaro, Wegovy), aesthetics (Dysport, Sculptra)
- **The appeal:** Own practice spend relationship, then layer high-value Rx purchasing
- **The problem:** Same vertical integrator dynamics apply—McKesson/Cardinal own the supply chain, GPOs own pricing power, DEA licensing creates compliance burden
- **Watch:** If Nitra's Rx GMV grows meaningfully beyond supplies, could represent alternative distribution model. But margin economics are challenging—rewards programs erode interchange, must convert to marketplace take rate. See [[Vertical-AI-Moats]] for full Nitra analysis.

## Watch For

**If RIGHT (thesis plays out):**
- PBM private-label biosimilars exceed 60% market share by 2026
- FQHC complaints about 340B rebate timing in industry press
- Independent biosimilar manufacturers exit market or consolidate
- Wholesaler-MSO owned practices exceed 40% of specialty volume
- Standalone biosimilar/prior auth analytics companies fail to raise Series B or pivot to serving integrators
- Health systems announce prior auth staff reductions with AI replacement

**If WRONG (thesis fails):**
- FTC blocks PBM-payer combinations or mandates unbundling
- CMS transparency rules give independents pricing parity
- 340B pilot rolled back due to documented FQHC harm
- Independent biosimilar manufacturer reaches 25%+ market share
- Software-only company achieves $50M+ ARR without integrator partnership
- Medical prior auth automation reaches pharmacy-level rates (70%+)

## Open Questions

**Will CVS breakup create market structure change?**
→ OPEN: If CVS spins off PBM, could create independent PBM willing to work with independent biosimilar manufacturers. Watch Q1-Q2 2025 announcements.

**Can independents aggregate before acquisition wave completes?**
→ OPEN: If <1,000 independent specialty practices remain by 2026, virtual GPO TAM too small.

**Will 340B pilot expand beyond IRA-negotiated drugs?**
→ OPEN: If pilot remains limited, stratification is modest and financing opportunity is narrow.
