# Thesis: Biosimilar Market Dynamics

**Type:** Market Segment (Who buys? What are the economics?)

## The Take

US biosimilar adoption is 20% vs EU's 80% because of perverse economics—hospitals lose $3,000+ per patient by switching. This isn't ignorance; it's rational behavior under broken incentives. The fix: software that identifies margin-positive switches using transparency data. 2025-2028 window before regulatory changes close it.

**How this evolved:** Started as "why won't doctors switch?" Realized it's not clinical resistance—it's financial. Transparency data revealed the smoking gun: hospitals paid MORE for biosimilars than reference in 20% of cases. The opportunity is aligning incentives, not education. PBM dynamics and MSO consolidation create concentrated buyers who want switching tools.

**Market size:** $50B in provider-administered biologics. 35-40% biosimilar penetration by 2030 = $17-20B addressable. Software capturing 1-2% of savings = $50-140M ARR potential. US biosimilar market growing from $9.5B (2022) to projected $100.75B by 2029 (40.2% CAGR). Reference brands worth $200B losing exclusivity over next 10 years.

## Maturity: Established

## How The Market Works

**The perverse incentive math (from Turquoise transparency data):**

| Drug | Hospital Pays | Hospital Gets Paid | Margin |
|------|--------------|-------------------|--------|
| Avastin (reference) | $3,188 | $6,552 | **$3,364** |
| Mvasi (biosimilar) | $2,791 | $3,007 | **$216** |

**Hospitals lose $3,148 per patient by switching to biosimilar.**

Why? Payers negotiate hospital rates as % of charges (arbitrary list prices). Higher-priced drugs = higher reimbursement. No mechanism aligns provider incentives with payer/patient incentives.

**The buy-and-bill mechanics:**

1. Provider purchases biologic at acquisition cost
2. Provider administers to patient
3. Provider bills payer at negotiated percentage of list price (e.g., ASP + 6%)
4. Higher list price reference biologics = higher absolute margin despite same percentage

**PBM incentive misalignment:**

PBMs benefit from higher list prices—larger manufacturer rebates while guaranteeing lower net costs to plan sponsors. This creates pressure on manufacturers to keep list prices high even for biosimilars. Prime example: Humira biosimilars in 2023, where formularies still provided greater access to originator despite cheaper biosimilars available.

**EU solved differently:** Government sets reimbursement at biosimilar price + small margin. Physicians salaried. Automatic pharmacy substitution.

**US will solve via market-based transparency:** Data now exists to find margin-positive switches. Hospital transparency rules + prescription drug MRF create dataset for software arbitrage.

## Competitive Landscape

**Biosimilar Manufacturers (Fighting for market share)**

**Top-Tier Integrated Manufacturers:**
- **Amgen** - Amjevita (adalimumab): $761M sales (2024), 22% YoY growth. First full year on US market. Retinal biosimilar PAVBLU (aflibercept) launched late 2024, driving 13% biosimilar sales surge Q1 2025. Vertically integrated (biologics + biosimilars), pricing power.
- **Sandoz International** (Novartis spinoff) - Hyrimoz (adalimumab-adaz): contributed to 30% portfolio growth, $2.9B total biosimilar sales (2024). Emerged as rheumatologist preference (payer dynamics + familiarity). Double-digit biosimilar growth.
- **Samsung Bioepis** - Adalimumab biosimilars gaining share. $1.46B invested in Korean capacity expansion. Manufacturing scale as competitive advantage.

**Specialty Biosimilar Players:**
- **Celltrion Healthcare** - Omlyclo (omalizumab-igec): First FDA-approved respiratory biosimilar with interchangeability (March 2025). Adalimumab-aaty in Prime Therapeutics 2025 formulary. Oncology/immunology focus.
- **Coherus BioSciences** - Sold Udenyca (pegfilgrastim) franchise for up to $558M (Dec 2024), signaling strategic pivot. Focused portfolio approach.
- **Biocon Limited** - Emerging biosimilar player, lower-cost manufacturing base (India).

**Traditional Pharma Pivoting:**
- **Pfizer** - Top 5 market player, leveraging existing biologics infrastructure.
- **Teva Pharmaceutical** - Simlandi (adalimumab) in Prime 2025 formulary. Generic drug expertise applied to biosimilars.
- **Organon** - Hadlima (adalimumab-bwwd): Emerged as one of top 2 adalimumab biosimilars with Hyrimoz. In Prime 2025 formulary.

**Market Concentration:** 15-20 major players control market; top 5 command 60-65% share. Bevacizumab biosimilars achieved 90% market share (Q1 2025), adalimumab biosimilars at 23% (Nov 2024, up from 2% early 2024). Winner-take-most dynamics emerging.

**Switching Software & Decision Support (Nascent category)**

- **Change Healthcare LLC** - Technology-driven PBM provider with modular claim adjudication, automated rebate management, AI-powered analytics. Integrates with payer/pharmacy systems. Potential biosimilar switching layer.
- **Prime Therapeutics LLC** - Collaborative PBM model with advanced prior authorization and appeals management. Cloud-based, modular architecture. 2025 formulary recommends 4 adalimumab biosimilars (Hadlima, Simlandi, adalimumab-adaz, adalimumab-aaty). Formulary design = switching decision.
- **Magellan Health** - PBM software for specialty drug benefits and clinical workflows. Interoperability with specialty pharmacies. Gap: real-time provider margin calculation at point of prescribing.

**No pure-play biosimilar switching intelligence platform identified.** Existing tools focus on formulary management (payer-side) or prior authorization (administrative friction). White space: provider-side margin optimization software.

**Health System Platforms (Potential buyers)**

- **Vizient** - GPO + pharmacy solutions for health systems. Biosimilar adoption strategy services. Formulary review process, but not real-time EMR integration.
- **Evernorth** (Cigna) - Specialty biosimilar adoption strategies. Payer-owned, potential conflict of interest with provider margin optimization.
- **Electronic Medical Record vendors** (Epic, Cerner/Oracle) - Integration point for switching software, but no biosimilar-specific intelligence layer.

**Manufacturing Capacity Players (Supply-side enablers)**

- **Fujifilm Diosynth** - $3.2B in new capacity (Denmark + North Carolina). CDMO model.
- Samsung Biologics alone investing $1.46B in additional capacity.

First-wave manufacturers (2-3 per molecule) will capture economic value while prices high. Later entrants face commoditization. Software opportunity sits between manufacturers and providers, extracting rent from steering.

## Why This Matters Now

1. **FDA guidance accelerates supply (Oct 2025).** Eliminated comparative efficacy studies. Dropped switching study requirements (June 2024 draft guidance). Saves $24M + 1-3 years per biosimilar. Development costs down from $100-300M to $75-250M. Projection: 30-40 launches by 2028 vs original 20. Within first half of 2025, FDA approved 12 biosimilars across immunology, oncology, endocrinology.

2. **FDA enabling real-world data for approvals (Dec 2025).** New guidance allows RWD without patient identifiers—from insurers, hospitals, registries. Devices first, drugs/biologics coming. Biosimilar outcome data can now support regulatory and coverage decisions without expensive RCTs. Interchangeability designations now granted on comparative analytical/clinical data alone (no switching studies required).

3. **BSUFA V negotiations ensure continued regulatory focus (FY2028-2032).** Biosimilar User Fee Act V stakeholder consultations ongoing (Dec 2025), setting FDA funding for biosimilar reviews through 2032. This secures the regulatory infrastructure for the 30-40 biosimilar launches projected by 2028. Unlike the temporary nature of guidance documents, BSUFA authorization is Congressional mandate—it guarantees FDA capacity to process the pipeline, not just permission to approve. The timing matters: BSUFA V covers the exact window (2028-2032) when the patent cliff ($400B in reference products 2029-2034) hits hardest.

4. **FDA promotional labeling guidance removes adoption friction (Dec 2025).** New guidance on advertising prescription biologics including biosimilars addresses a key non-economic barrier: physician education. Marketing restrictions previously created information asymmetry—biosimilar manufacturers couldn't clearly communicate interchangeability or clinical equivalence in promotional materials, forcing physicians to independently research therapeutic equivalence. Clearer promotional pathways accelerate physician comfort with prescribing. This matters because US adoption is 20% vs EU's 80% due to BOTH perverse economics AND educational gaps. The guidance fixes one; transparency data + switching software fixes the other. The combination is what creates the 2025-2028 window—supply (BSUFA V), information (promotional guidance), and economic alignment (transparency + software) converge.

5. **MSO consolidation creates concentrated buyers.** Big 3 wholesalers (Cencora, Cardinal, McKesson) spent $16B+ on MSO acquisitions. OneOncology, US Oncology Network = concentrated prescribing power. They want biosimilar steering. 3-5x margins on biosimilar steering vs traditional distribution.

6. **Transparency data now public.** Hospital pricing already live. Prescription drug MRF coming. Can benchmark and identify margin-positive switches at scale. Free data infrastructure eliminates $5M+ pricing database build cost.

7. **Patent cliff accelerating.** 25 high-value biologics lost exclusivity in 2025 alone. $400B in reference product sales becoming biosimilar-eligible 2029-2034. 64 FDA-approved biosimilars across 17 molecules (Q4 2024). 43 biosimilars launched in US market.

8. **Market share inflection points visible.** Adalimumab biosimilars: 2% → 23% market share in 12 months (2024). Bevacizumab biosimilars: 90% market share. Private label PBM brands driving adoption. Proof that switching happens when incentives align.

## The Bull Case

1. **Manufacturer desperation.** 10 Humira biosimilars competing. Only first-wave manufacturers (2-3 per molecule) achieve attractive economics. Later entrants face commoditization. Manufacturers will pay high rebates for steering. Whoever controls prescribing decision extracts rent. Coherus sold pegfilgrastim franchise for $558M—consolidation creating urgency.

2. **MSO incentive alignment.** Wholesaler-owned MSOs make 3-5x margins on biosimilar steering vs traditional distribution. They're motivated buyers for switching software. $16B+ MSO acquisition wave creates concentrated decision-makers. OneOncology + US Oncology Network = scaled deployment targets.

3. **Transparency = free data.** No need to build $5M+ pricing database. Just process public MRF files. Hospital transparency + prescription drug transparency = complete margin calculation dataset. Software arbitrage opportunity with zero data acquisition cost.

4. **Proven switching velocity.** Adalimumab 2% → 23% in 12 months proves providers WILL switch when economics work. Bevacizumab at 90% proves path to dominance exists. Gap is identifying WHICH switches are margin-positive. Software solves this.

5. **PBM private label acceleration.** Private label brands (Prime Therapeutics recommending 4 adalimumab biosimilars in 2025 formulary) create formulary-level switching pressure. But formulary ≠ prescribing. Real-time margin intelligence at EMR level converts formulary recommendations to actual switches.

6. **Development cost collapse.** $100-300M → $75-250M per biosimilar. Switching study elimination + RWD acceptance = flood of new entrants 2025-2028. More biosimilars = more manufacturer desperation = higher willingness to pay for steering.

7. **$100B+ market in 10 years.** US biosimilar market $9.5B (2022) → $100.75B (2029) at 40.2% CAGR. Reference brands worth $200B losing exclusivity. 1-2% software capture = $1-2B ARR opportunity at scale.

---

## The Bear Case

1. **IRA anti-biosimilar bias.** Inflation Reduction Act has perverse incentives that discourage biosimilar adoption in certain contexts. If reference biologic selected for price negotiation, biosimilar pricing advantage narrows. Policy could undermine market-based switching economics.

2. **2028 Medicare Part B cliff.** Massive reimbursement cuts to physician practices (ASP + 6% → ASP + 2-3%) could crush buy-and-bill economics before adoption window closes. If provider margins collapse entirely, switching software becomes irrelevant—nobody makes money on biologics.

3. **CMS mandate risk.** If biosimilar substitution moves to pharmacy level (like generics), physician decision point disappears. June 2024 FDA guidance eliminating switching studies for interchangeability enables automatic pharmacy substitution. Software becomes irrelevant if pharmacists make the switch, not physicians.

4. **PBM opacity persists.** PBMs benefit from high list prices (larger rebates). Manufacturer list price pressure creates dynamic where biosimilar discounts shrink to maintain PBM economics. Transparency data shows prices, but PBM rebate complexity obscures true net costs. Margin calculation becomes unreliable.

5. **First-wave winners capture all value.** Only 2-3 biosimilars per molecule achieve attractive economics. Late entrants commoditize. If manufacturer steering contracts lock in relationships early (before software exists), software opportunity closes. Amgen ($761M Amjevita), Sandoz ($2.9B portfolio), Samsung Bioepis (capacity investments) already establishing positions.

6. **Provider resistance to financial transparency.** Hospitals losing $3,148 per switch is known internally. Making it explicit via software creates political/reputational risk. Physicians may resist tools that highlight profit-maximizing (vs patient-optimizing) behavior. Health system procurement may block for this reason.

7. **Rapid capability ceiling.** Single-digit number of high-value biosimilar classes (adalimumab, bevacizumab, etc.). Once margin-positive switches identified, value captured quickly. Software may have 2-3 year useful life before all obvious switches exhausted. Not a durable moat.

- **Technical approach:** EMR-integrated decision support at point of prescribing
- **Core capability:** Real-time margin calculation using hospital transparency data + payer reimbursement rates
- **Interface:** Physician sees clinical safety data + practice revenue impact per switch
- **Data sources:** CMS transparency files (hospital charges + payer negotiated rates), biosimilar clinical data (FDA Purple Book), formulary coverage (PBM data)
- **GTM:** Sell to MSO-owned practices (OneOncology, US Oncology Network, Cencora/Cardinal/McKesson MSOs)
- **Revenue model:** $50/provider/month SaaS + $15/successful conversion performance fee
- **First customer:** Oncology MSOs (highest biologic spend, 90% bevacizumab biosimilar adoption proves receptivity)
- **Wedge:** Start with margin-positive switches only (no provider sacrifice), expand to payer-subsidized switches
- **Validation needed:** Pilot with 1-2 oncology practices, measure conversion rate + margin impact

**2. Prior Auth Automation for Biosimilars**
- **Problem:** Switching friction averages 45 minutes per prior authorization
- **Solution:** Auto-generate medical necessity documentation from biosimilar clinical data
- **Technical approach:** LLM-based prior auth letter generation trained on approved biosimilar documentation
- **Operational barrier removal:** 45 min → 90 sec reduces physician resistance to switching

- **GTM:** Sell to specialty pharmacies and MSOs processing high-volume prior auths
- **Integration:** EMR plugins (Epic, Cerner) + PBM portals (Change Healthcare, Prime)
- **Moat:** Approval rate optimization via learned policy patterns (which documentation language works)

**3. Biosimilar Outcomes Registry**
- **Core value:** Real-world evidence infrastructure for biosimilar safety/efficacy
- **Data capture:** Track conversions, prove non-inferiority, identify rare adverse events
- **Sell data back to:** Manufacturers (post-marketing surveillance), payers (formulary decisions), MSOs (internal confidence), FDA (regulatory submissions via RWD pathway)
- **Revenue model:** Registry participation fees ($10k-50k/year per institution) + data licensing ($100k-500k per manufacturer)
- **Moat:** Network effects—more conversions = more data = more valuable registry
- **Regulatory catalyst:** FDA RWD guidance (Dec 2025) accepting data without patient identifiers creates buyer urgency
- **GTM:** Start with single high-volume biosimilar (adalimumab or bevacizumab), expand to full portfolio

- **Differentiation:** Provider-side (not payer-side) optimization—align MSO profits with physician revenue
- **Revenue model:** % of incremental biosimilar margin (outcomes-based), 10-20% of savings
- **First customer:** OneOncology or US Oncology Network (concentrated, sophisticated buyers)
- **Expansion:** Horizontal across MSO portfolios (oncology → rheumatology → gastroenterology)

**5. PBM Biosimilar Analytics Layer**
- **Gap identified:** Prime Therapeutics, Change Healthcare, Magellan have formulary tools but not real-time provider margin intelligence
- **Solution:** Data layer that sits between PBM formulary and EMR prescribing
- **Capabilities:** Margin calculation, utilization forecasting, provider communication templates
- **Revenue model:** Per-member-per-month (PMPM) fee to PBMs, $0.50-2.00 PMPM
- **GTM:** Partner with PBM software vendors (Change Healthcare modular architecture = integration opportunity)
- **Risk:** PBM conflict of interest (high list prices benefit PBM rebates, biosimilar margin transparency exposes this)

## Open Questions

### Will CMS mandate pharmacy-level biosimilar substitution (like generics)?

**Priority:** P0 (investment-blocking)

**Investment Gate:** If biosimilar substitution moves to pharmacy level, physician decision point disappears. Provider-side switching software becomes irrelevant—pharmacists make the decision, not prescribers.

**What Would Change My Mind:**
- If CMS issues guidance requiring pharmacy-level substitution within 18-24 months → Provider-side software opportunity closes. Pivot to pharmacy-focused tools or outcomes registry only.
- If FDA interchangeability designations (no switching studies required, June 2024 guidance) remain optional and provider choice preserved → Provider decision point durable. Full investment in switching intelligence platform justified.
- If hybrid model emerges (pharmacy substitution for some biosimilars, provider choice for high-risk/specialty) → Narrow TAM to specialty biologics only (oncology, immunology). Smaller but defensible market.

**How to Find Out:**
- Monitor CMS proposed rules 2025-2026 (Medicare Part B reimbursement changes often signal substitution policy)
- Interview FDA regulatory affairs teams on interchangeability vs substitution roadmap
- Track state pharmacy practice laws (some states already allow biosimilar substitution, others require provider consent)
- Survey specialty pharmacy leaders on biosimilar dispensing autonomy trends
- Analyze EU/Canada models (automatic substitution common—did it eliminate provider decision?)

### What is the margin improvement distribution across biosimilar switches?

**Priority:** P0 (investment-blocking for provider-side platform)

**Investment Gate:** If only 5-10% of switches are margin-positive (rest margin-negative or neutral), TAM too narrow. If 40-60% margin-positive, massive opportunity.

**What Would Change My Mind:**
- If transparency data analysis shows <15% margin-positive switches → Provider value prop weak, requires payer subsidies from Day 1. Focus on payer-MSO partnerships instead of pure provider play.
- If 30-50% margin-positive switches → Strong standalone provider value prop. Build provider-first, add payer partnerships later.
- If margin distribution varies dramatically by specialty (oncology 60% positive, rheumatology 10%) → Vertical-specific GTM required. Start oncology only.

**How to Find Out:**
- Download CMS hospital transparency files (machine-readable format)
- Parse negotiated rates for top 20 biologics + biosimilar pairs (adalimumab, bevacizumab, trastuzumab, rituximab, infliximab, etc.)
- Calculate margin spread (hospital gets paid - hospital pays) for reference vs biosimilar
- Segment by payer (Medicare, Medicaid, commercial), geography, hospital type
- Quantify % of switches that are margin-positive, margin-neutral, margin-negative
- Validate with 3-5 MSO CFOs on real prescribing data

### How durable is the 2025-2028 window before regulatory changes?

**Priority:** P1 (thesis-changing for timing/urgency)

**Investment Gate:** If window extends to 2030+, normal startup timeline works. If window closes 2026-2027, requires rapid execution or different approach (registry vs switching software).

**What Would Change My Mind:**
- If CMS signals pharmacy substitution mandate by 2027 → 18-24 month window only. Outcomes registry more durable than switching software. Prioritize registry build.
- If provider choice preserved through 2030+ (status quo inertia) → Normal 5-7 year startup timeline. Build switching platform first, add registry later.
- If IRA reforms or Medicare Part B cuts happen 2026-2028 → Economics change but provider decision remains. Software still valuable but pricing model shifts.

**How to Find Out:**
- Track CMS rulemaking calendar (proposed rules typically 12-18 months before implementation)
- Interview health policy experts (Brookings, KFF, healthcare lobbyists) on biosimilar substitution likelihood
- Analyze Medicare Part B reimbursement trends (ASP + 6% cuts = bellwether for buy-and-bill changes)
- Monitor Congressional biosimilar legislation (bipartisan support for adoption, but mechanics unclear)
- Survey payers on timeline expectations for interchangeability vs substitution

### Can PBMs be convinced to support provider margin transparency?

**Priority:** P1 (thesis-changing for channel partnership strategy)

**Investment Gate:** PBMs benefit from high list prices (larger manufacturer rebates). Provider margin transparency exposes this conflict. Can PBMs be partners or only competitors?

**What Would Change My Mind:**
- If PBMs embrace transparency as competitive differentiator (Prime Therapeutics model—collaborative vs adversarial) → Channel partnership viable. Co-sell with PBMs to MSOs.
- If PBMs block provider margin tools (contractual restrictions, formulary retaliation) → PBMs are adversaries. Direct-to-provider GTM only, avoid PBM dependencies.
- If PBM-owned MSOs (CVS, Cigna) create walled gardens → Fragmented market, need multiple PBM integrations. Higher CAC, slower scaling.

**How to Find Out:**
- Interview Prime Therapeutics, Magellan Health (collaborative PBM models) on margin transparency philosophy
- Pitch Change Healthcare on analytics layer partnership (modular architecture = integration opportunity)
- Survey MSO executives on PBM contractual restrictions around biosimilar switching software
- Analyze CVS/Cigna vertical integration incentives (do they want provider margin optimization or opacity?)
- Study PBM rebate disclosure trends (California SB 17, other state laws forcing transparency)

### Will outcomes registry data be sufficiently valuable to manufacturers?

**Priority:** P2 (opportunity-defining for registry revenue model)

**Investment Gate:** Registry requires 3-5 year investment before data monetization. If manufacturers won't pay $200k-500k/year for RWE, economics don't work.

**What Would Change My Mind:**
- If FDA RWD pathway (Dec 2025 guidance) creates regulatory value → Manufacturers pay $500k-1M for post-marketing surveillance data. Registry becomes primary revenue stream.
- If manufacturers only pay for registries during development (pre-approval) → Post-launch registry less valuable. Focus on provider-side platform instead.
- If payer coverage decisions require RWE (not just regulatory approval) → Dual buyer market (manufacturers + payers). Registry revenue $1-2M per biosimilar molecule.

**How to Find Out:**
- Interview biosimilar manufacturers (Amgen, Sandoz, Samsung Bioepis) on RWE budget allocation
- Survey payers on biosimilar formulary decision criteria (do they require post-marketing RWE beyond FDA approval?)
- Analyze Flatiron Health revenue model (oncology RWE—what % from manufacturers vs payers vs providers?)
- Pilot registry with 2-3 institutions, approach 5 manufacturers with data licensing proposal (test willingness to pay)
- Track FDA biosimilar approvals using RWD (precedent creates demand)

### What is the MSO biosimilar steering margin in practice?

**Priority:** P2 (opportunity-defining for MSO platform revenue model)

**Investment Gate:** Wholesalers claim 3-5x margins on biosimilar steering vs distribution. If actual margin is 1.5-2x, MSO willingness to pay for software drops significantly.

**What Would Change My Mind:**
- If validated margin is 3-5x → MSOs will pay 10-20% of incremental margin for software enablement. Outcomes-based pricing works, $2M+ ACV achievable.
- If actual margin closer to 1.5-2x → MSO economics weaker, willingness to pay $500k-1M max. SaaS model (not outcomes-based) required.
- If margin varies by biosimilar class (oncology 4x, rheumatology 1.5x) → Vertical-specific pricing. Oncology premium pricing, rheumatology volume play.

**How to Find Out:**
- Interview Cencora, Cardinal, McKesson executives on MSO biosimilar steering P&L
- Survey OneOncology, US Oncology Network on biosimilar economics (manufacturer rebates + distribution margin)
- Analyze wholesaler 10-K filings for specialty distribution margin trends
- Speak with biosimilar manufacturers on rebate/steering payment structures to MSOs
- Pilot with one MSO, measure actual margin improvement vs claimed 3-5x
