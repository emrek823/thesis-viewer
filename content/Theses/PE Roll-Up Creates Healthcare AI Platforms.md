# Thesis: PE Roll-Up Creates Healthcare AI Platforms

## Investment Take

PE is consolidating healthcare AI/RCM into platform plays—and standalone vendors are getting squeezed. The signal is unmistakable: Matt Holt left New Mountain Capital to combine Datavant, Swoop, Machinify, SmarterDx, and Office Ally into "Thoreau"—a $30B health-tech venture ([[Holt exits New Mountain to create $30 billion health‑tech venture]]). New Mountain would retain $2B equity while booking $14B for LPs.

This isn't isolated. Machinify acquired Performant for $670M. Cotiviti acquired Edifecs for $3.05B. The pattern: PE buys point solutions, consolidates into platforms, creates distribution moat that standalone startups can't match.

The math favors roll-ups. Datavant's 2020 deck showed 150% NRR with 200+ organizations and 100B+ patient records ([[datavant-corporate-overview-deck-2-22-20-1-0d0cb6be]]). Once you're the "health data network," switching costs compound. Add adjacent capabilities (payment integrity, coding, claims) and you own the stack.

**The investment angle:** Don't compete with platforms. Either (1) build to be acquired by a roll-up, (2) find niches platforms won't touch, or (3) invest in the acquirers themselves.

**How this evolved:**
- *2025-12-22:* Pattern emerged from Holt $30B deal + Machinify/Performant + Cotiviti/Edifecs. Three major consolidation moves in 2025 alone.

## Bull Case

- [x] **PE consolidation accelerating.** Holt $30B, Machinify $670M, Cotiviti $3.05B—all in 2025.
  - *Evidence:* [[Holt exits New Mountain to create $30 billion health‑tech venture]] — Five companies into one platform

- [ ] **Distribution moat compounds.** Once you have 200+ health systems, adding products is easy. Standalone vendors can't match reach.
  - *Evidence:* [[datavant-corporate-overview-deck-2-22-20-1-0d0cb6be]] — 150% NRR, 100B+ patient records

- [ ] **Platforms win on bundling.** Health systems prefer one vendor for data + coding + payment integrity vs. managing 5 point solutions.
  - *Evidence:* Needs validation — Interview health system CIOs on vendor consolidation preferences

---

## Bear Case

- [ ] **Integration risk.** PE roll-ups often stumble on integration. Different tech stacks, cultures, sales motions.
  - *Evidence:* Needs monitoring — Track Thoreau integration progress

- [ ] **Startups can still win niches.** Platforms spread thin. Specialists in oncology, rare disease, or specific workflows may outperform.
  - *Evidence:* Needs validation — Find examples of startups winning vs. platforms

- [ ] **Regulatory scrutiny.** Consolidation may attract antitrust attention, especially in healthcare data.
  - *Evidence:* Needs monitoring — Track FTC/DOJ healthcare tech enforcement

## Startup Opportunities

**1. Build-to-Acquire Strategy**
- Build point solution with clear acquisition path to Thoreau/Cotiviti/Machinify
- Why this follows: Platforms need capabilities. Faster to buy than build.
- Risk: Acquisition multiples may compress as platforms gain leverage

**2. Platform-Proof Niches**
- Specialty workflows (oncology coding, rare disease prior auth) too complex for platforms
- Why this follows: Platforms optimize for scale, not depth
- Risk: Platforms may eventually enter

**3. Alternative Data Networks**
- Build competing data network before platforms lock up all distribution
- Why this follows: Data network effects are winner-take-most
- Risk: Capital-intensive, may be too late

## Open Questions

**Will Thoreau actually close?**
→ OPEN: Deal "remains subject to closing conditions." Track Reuters/Bloomberg for updates.

**How do platforms price acquisitions?**
→ OPEN: Need to understand acquisition multiples for point solutions. Interview investment bankers.

**Which capabilities are platforms missing?**
→ OPEN: Map platform gaps to identify acquisition targets or defensible niches.
