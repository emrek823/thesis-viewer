# Thesis: Call Center AI Cuts Abandonment 90%—Distribution Play Not Tech Play

## Investment Take

Healthcare call centers are a $2B+ market with obvious AI automation opportunity—but the investment angle isn't the technology. It's distribution. Assort Health proved the math: 40%+ abandonment → 4-6%, 7-8 min calls → 2-2.5 min, 7 FTEs → 4 FTEs with better outcomes ([[Chief Executive Officer at Barrington Orthopedic Specialists _ Assort Health _ Tegus]]). Rating: 9-10/10.

The tech works. The question is: **who has the relationships?** Barrington Orthopedic found Assort through a referral from Nexus-MD (imaging integration vendor). Pacific Dental evaluated Assort, PolyAI, SuperDial, Luma, Olive across 1,200+ locations—ultimately chose PolyAI for "superior integrations and negotiation flexibility" ([[16 Assort Health _ Interviews _ Tegus Company Profile]]). The winner isn't the best AI. It's the best channel partner.

Pricing is usage-based, low six figures annually. ROI break-even at 1.5 FTEs. Practices expanding use cases: 24/7 scheduling, voicemail transcription, outbound confirmation calls. But the market is fragmented—no dominant player yet.

**The bear case is EMR bundling.** Athena costs <$1.1M/year. If athena or Epic ships native scheduling AI at zero marginal cost, standalone vendors get squeezed. The CEO explicitly said: "I could see them partnering with somebody like athena... you like to stay in your lane."

**How this evolved:**
- *2025-12-21:* Emerged from 6 Assort Health sources initially dismissed as "point solution." Full read revealed 90% abandonment reduction, clear ROI, but distribution > tech as moat.
- *2025-12-22:* **7th Assort customer confirms: 9/10 rating, $90K annual savings.** Retina practice (6 locations, 10K calls/month) reduced missed calls from 30%→near-zero. Key: saved $90K by eliminating another vendor + reassigning 2 FTEs. "Assort's the buzziest" in retina space. Athena integration was critical—only evaluated vendors with Athena connectivity ([[Chief Administrative Officer at a Medical Group _ Assort Health _ Tegus]]).

## Bull Case

- [x] **ROI is proven and simple.** 40%+ → 4-6% abandonment. 7→4 FTEs. Break-even at 1.5 FTEs. CFOs can do this math.
  - *Evidence:* [[Chief Executive Officer at Barrington Orthopedic Specialists _ Assort Health _ Tegus]] — Specific metrics validated

- [ ] **Expansion use cases compound.** Started with scheduling → 24/7 coverage → voicemail transcription → outbound calls → pre-auth.
  - *Evidence:* [[Chief Executive Officer at Barrington Orthopedic Specialists _ Assort Health _ Tegus]] — "Could double spend" for full use cases

- [ ] **Channel partnerships are the wedge.** Nexus-MD referral led to Barrington. Integration partners have distribution.
  - *Evidence:* Needs validation — Track which vendors are embedding vs building

## Bear Case

- [ ] **EMR vendors bundle.** If athena/Epic ship native AI scheduling at zero marginal cost, standalone vendors squeezed to niches.
  - *Evidence:* [[Chief Executive Officer at Barrington Orthopedic Specialists _ Assort Health _ Tegus]] — "I could see them partnering with athena"

- [ ] **Switching is easy.** No lock-in, phone-system agnostic. If competitor is 20% better, practices switch.
  - *Evidence:* [[16 Assort Health _ Interviews _ Tegus Company Profile]] — Pacific Dental chose PolyAI over Assort

- [ ] **Fragmented market stays fragmented.** No network effects. Each practice is independent sale.
  - *Evidence:* Needs monitoring — Track consolidation M&A

## Startup Opportunities

**1. Channel-First Scheduling AI**
- Partner with EMR/PM vendors (athena, eClinicalWorks) for embedded distribution
- Why this follows: Tech is commodity, distribution is moat
- Wedge: Revenue share with PM vendors
- Risk: PM vendors build internally

**2. Vertical-Specific Scheduling (DSO, Ortho, Retina)**
- Deep specialty workflows (e.g., "which doctor for which body part")
- Why this follows: Assort won on specialty configuration, not generic AI
- Wedge: Reference customers in specialty
- Risk: Small TAM per vertical

**3. Outbound Call Expansion**
- Confirmation calls, pre-auth, collections
- Why this follows: Inbound scheduling is wedge, outbound is expansion
- Wedge: Proven inbound → cross-sell outbound
- Risk: Different buyer (RCM vs operations)

## Open Questions

**Will EMR vendors bundle or partner?**
→ OPEN: If athena acquires Assort-like vendor, validates category but caps upside. If they partner, standalone vendors survive.

**Is this a $100M company or $1B company?**
→ OPEN: Fragmented market, no network effects suggests many $50-100M outcomes, not winner-take-all.

**Does PolyAI or Assort pull ahead?**
→ OPEN: Pacific Dental chose PolyAI. Track enterprise wins.
