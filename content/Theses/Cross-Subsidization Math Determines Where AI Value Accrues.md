# Thesis: Cross-Subsidization Math Determines Where AI Value Accrues

## Investment Take

Health systems run on cross-subsidization: elective procedures (22-25% margins) fund emergency care (-15% to -18% margins). One spinal fusion offsets three sepsis cases ([[An Analysis of DRG Profitability and Cross-Subsidization in Academic Medical Centers]]). AI that improves elective efficiency protects the cash cow. AI that reduces emergency costs saves money nobody was capturing anyway. Understanding this math determines where AI creates extractable value vs where it creates savings that disappear into the margin hole.

MA is at margin trough: -2.0% pre-tax margins (2025E), worst in 25+ years. Industry MLR reached 91% (+220bps YoY). UnitedHealth projected $6.5B more in medical costs than anticipated ([[Financial Performance of U.S. Health Insurers (2010–2025) (2)]]). Medical cost trends accelerated to 7.5-8.5%—fastest since mid-2000s—driven by GLP-1 ($50B extra pharmacy spending) and behavioral health (+45% utilization). But this creates embedded earnings opportunity: achieving 4.5% MA margins would boost sector EPS by 50%.

Health system CFOs think in portfolio terms, not service line ROI. They won't cut ortho to fund sepsis AI. Will Detwiler confirmed: CFOs responding "top 3 priority" to margin analytics by code/payer/physician ([[Will Detwiler and Emre Karatas]]). AI companies selling to the wrong buyer (CMO for clinical value vs CFO for margin protection) fail.

**How this evolved:**
- *2025-12-18:* DRG profitability analysis crystallized the insight. Health systems optimize around protecting high-margin service lines, not reducing costs on money-losers.
- *2025-12-21:* Added MA margin data. Cost trend acceleration (7.5-8.5%) + VBC adoption (34% of MA payments, up from 10.3% in 2017) validates cross-thesis with Specialty-VBC-Dynamics.
- *2025-12-22:* **Menlo Ventures validates AI spend is real.** Healthcare AI adoption 2.2x broader economy (22% vs 9%). $1.4B spent in 2025, nearly 3x 2024. Health systems lead (27% adoption). Key: **85% of spend going to startups, not incumbents**. Ambient docs $600M, coding/billing $450M. Procurement cycles shortening 18-22% for AI. Epic/Oracle incumbency threatened.
- *2025-12-22:* **R1 RCM confirms payer incentive to maintain admin burden.** "There's a real incentive for payers to keep it labor-intensive...because there's a financial incentive to avoid paying claims." RCM automation only 15-20%. Cost-to-collect: 3.5-4% outsourced vs 2.5-3% best-in-class in-house, but "institutional barriers" make in-house too hard. Epic has 50% market share, won 70% of contracts—but "decade behind" pure-play tech ([[Former Vice President Of Enterprise Analytics at R1 RCM _ Waystar Holding Corp. _ Tegus]]).
- *2025-12-22:* **WellSky shows automation ceiling is high but execution varies wildly.** Best facilities reach 70% RCM automation; average is far lower. One client went 500→80 FTEs through bot-based automation. "$20M clinical denials" across footprint. But it's RPA not AI—"hard-coded rules" that break when payer requirements change. Gap between best-in-class and average is the opportunity ([[Senior Director of Revenue Cycle Management at WellSky _ Waystar Holding Corp. _ Tegus]]).
- *2025-12-22:* **Trilliant confirms admin burden is systemic.** Hospital admin costs ($687B) are 2x direct patient care ($346B) in 2023—and grew 87.2% since 2011. ED upcoding rampant: CPT 99284-99285 visits rose from 36.6%→47.8% (2018-2024). AMC negotiated rates 6.4x higher than safety-net hospitals for same CPT in Houston. UHC pays Optum (Kelsey Seybold) 70% more than other providers for same codes. Cross-subsidization runs deep—different hospitals get wildly different rates from same payer ([[Trilliant]]).

## Bull Case

- [x] **CFO pain is real and budgeted.** CFOs responding "top 3 priority" to margin analytics. Previous supply chain pitch got "we'll get around to it."
  - *Evidence:* [[Will Detwiler and Emre Karatas]] — CFO priority shift confirmed

- [ ] **First AI companies to understand this will win.** Selling margin protection to CFOs beats selling clinical improvement to CMOs.
  - *Evidence:* Needs validation — track which AI deals close and who championed internally

- [ ] **VBC transition creates opportunity.** As FFS margins compress, AI enabling VBC success becomes critical. 34% of MA payments now population-based.
  - *Evidence:* [[Financial Performance of U.S. Health Insurers (2010–2025) (2)]] — VBC at 34% of MA payments (up from 10.3% in 2017)

---

## Bear Case

- [ ] **Too fragmented.** Each health system has different economics. Hard to build scalable product.
  - *Evidence:* Needs validation — map service line economics across 10+ systems

- [ ] **Incumbents bundle.** Epic (274 AI customers) and Oracle bundle analytics with EHR. "Good enough" blocks specialized vendors.
  - *Evidence:* Texas antitrust case — Epic controls 90%+ records, distribution moat

- [ ] **Margin compression kills buyers.** If health systems can't afford anything, market shrinks. 30%+ operating negative margins.
  - *Evidence:* Needs monitoring — track software spending by margin quartile

## Startup Opportunities

**1. Elective Procedure Optimization Platform**
- OR scheduling, surgeon utilization, patient flow for high-margin procedures
- Why this follows: Protecting 22% margin procedures is CFO priority
- Sell to CFO: "Protect your cash cow service lines"
- Risk: Fragmented, each health system different

**2. Service Line Portfolio Analytics**
- Show health systems their cross-subsidization math
- Why this follows: CFOs need visibility into which AI investments protect vs which save money that doesn't exist
- Translucent's 5x growth ($625K→$1.8M) validates CFO demand
- Risk: Epic/Oracle bundle "good enough" analytics

**3. TEFCA-Native Analytics Aggregator**
- Exploit 2025 data interoperability mandates
- Why this follows: TEFCA breaks EHR lock-in; analytics can aggregate across Epic/Cerner/Allscripts
- Wedge: "Epic's analytics but across all your systems"
- Risk: EHR vendors improve native analytics, TEFCA enforcement delays

## Open Questions

**How do health systems actually make AI purchasing decisions?**
→ OPEN: CFO vs CMO vs CIO? If CMO clinical value pitch works, margin protection thesis wrong. Map decision flows at 5+ health systems.

**What is elasticity of health system software spending during margin compression?**
→ OPEN: If only high-performing systems (>10% margin) buy, TAM limited to 20-30% of market. Analyze spending by margin quartile.

**Will TEFCA enforcement create defensible moat for interoperability-native analytics?**
→ OPEN: If delayed 2+ years, EHR vendors improve native analytics first. Track ONC enforcement timeline.

**Which service lines have most room for AI efficiency gains?**
→ OPEN: If elective procedures already optimized, look elsewhere. Benchmark OR utilization rates.
