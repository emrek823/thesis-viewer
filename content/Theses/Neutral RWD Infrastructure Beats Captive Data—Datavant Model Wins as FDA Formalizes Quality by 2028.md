# Neutral RWD Infrastructure Beats Captive Data—Datavant Model Wins as FDA Formalizes Quality by 2028

## The Take

**Captive data strategies are dying. Neutral infrastructure wins.**

Roche's $3.2B Flatiron impairment proves that owning data creates an ownership paradox: competitors won't share with your subsidiary. Meanwhile, Datavant's neutral infrastructure model hit $1B+ revenue (profitable) by being the pipes, not the oil. As FDA formalizes real-world data quality requirements for regulatory submissions, the moat isn't data volume—it's **regulatory quality infrastructure** that LLMs cannot replicate.

**Confidence:** HIGH — Flatiron impairment is concrete proof of model failure; Datavant financials validate alternative.

> "Flatiron's association with Roche has deterred some rival drugmakers from engaging with the company, thereby affecting its sales."
> — [HLTH Insights: Roche's Strategic Crossroads](https://hlth.com/insights/articles/roche-s-strategic-crossroads-evaluating-the-future-of-flatiron-health-2024-08-12)

**Consensus believes:** Data is the new oil. Own the data, own the value. Tempus ($6B+ valuation), Flatiron (Roche), and Veeva are all building captive data assets because data creates moats.

**Actually:** Data volume without regulatory quality acceptance is worthless. LLMs commoditize extraction—anyone can pull insights from distributed data. The moat is the **validation layer** that makes data FDA-acceptable. Neutral infrastructure (Datavant) wins because pharma companies will share data through neutral brokers, not competitors' subsidiaries.

**In 5 years:** Datavant becomes the dominant RWD infrastructure layer. Tempus survives on diagnostics lock-in, not data licensing. Captive data models (Flatiron inside Roche) get divested or marginalized. FDA quality requirements become gatekeeping that creates durable moats for validation infrastructure.

## Why This Is True

### Mechanism 1: The Ownership Paradox Kills Captive Data Models

When a pharma company owns a data asset, competitors avoid it—destroying the network effects that make data valuable.

**Evidence:**

| Flatiron association with Roche "deterred rival drugmakers from engaging" | [HLTH Insights](https://hlth.com/insights/articles/roche-s-strategic-crossroads-evaluating-the-future-of-flatiron-health-2024-08-12) | HIGH |
| Roche wrote off $1.2B Flatiron goodwill (total $3.2B with Spark) | [Roche Finance Report 2024](https://assets.roche.com/f/176343/x/38d96ed8ec/fb24e.pdf) | HIGH |
| Roche exploring Flatiron sale with Citigroup by 2024 | [Fierce Healthcare](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/health-tech/roche-considering-sale-cancer-data-startup-flatiron-health-report) | HIGH |
| Two-thirds of Flatiron revenue came from pharma data sales | [HLTH Insights](https://hlth.com/insights/articles/roche-s-strategic-crossroads-evaluating-the-future-of-flatiron-health-2024-08-12) | HIGH |

**The paradox:**
1. Roche buys Flatiron for $1.9B (2018) to accelerate drug development with RWD
2. Flatiron's value depends on pharma companies buying data/insights
3. Rival pharmas (Pfizer, Merck, Novartis) avoid giving business to Roche subsidiary
4. Data network effects collapse → revenue declines → $3.2B impairment

**SO WHAT:** Captive data strategies work only when competitors don't care about ownership. In pharma, where every top-20 company is a competitor, ownership is fatal.

**NOW WHAT:** Evaluate RWD investments on neutrality. Datavant (neutral broker) > Tempus (mostly diagnostics) > Flatiron (captive data).

### Mechanism 2: Neutral Infrastructure Creates Network Effects Without Ownership Conflict

Datavant's model: be the pipes, not the oil. Connect data sources without owning them.

**Evidence:**

| Claim | Source | Confidence |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Datavant on track for $1B+ revenue in 2025, profitable, cash-flow positive | [Fierce Healthcare](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/health-tech/datavant-acquires-real-world-evidence-company-aetion-boost-its-life-sciences-business) | HIGH |
| 300+ data partners (EHRs, claims, specialty pharmacy, registries, imaging, lab, SDOH) | [Datavant Press Release](https://www.datavant.com/press-release/datavant-completes-acquisition-of-aetion) | HIGH |
| Acquired Aetion (July 2025) for end-to-end RWE platform | [Datavant Press Release](https://www.datavant.com/press-release/datavant-completes-acquisition-of-aetion) | HIGH |
| Aetion works with 40+ biopharma orgs, 80+ data partners | [Aetion Company](https://aetion.com/company) | HIGH |

**Why neutral wins:**
1. Pharma companies will share data through neutral broker (no competitive conflict)
2. More data partners = better linkage = better quality = more regulatory acceptance
3. Infrastructure lock-in (tokenization, PPRL, linkage) without ownership conflict
4. Network effects compound as more partners join

**Datavant + Aetion combined capabilities:**
- Data linkage and de-identification (Datavant core)
- Causal inference and RWE analytics (Aetion core)
- 300+ data partners
- FDA/EMA-grade evidence generation

**SO WHAT:** Neutral infrastructure can achieve network effects that captive models cannot. The broker wins by being indispensable to everyone.

**NOW WHAT:** Track Datavant's IPO timing. This is a potential $10B+ outcome if they maintain neutrality.

### Mechanism 3: FDA Quality Requirements Create Regulatory Gatekeeping

FDA is formalizing RWD quality requirements for regulatory submissions. Raw data volume is insufficient—validation infrastructure becomes the moat.

**Evidence:**

| Claim | Source | Confidence |
|-------|--------|------------|
| FDA's RWD guidance requires: computable phenotypes, data validation, distributed networks, Common Data Models (OMOP, Sentinel), QA/QC audit trails | [[Real-World Data Infrastructure Becomes Pharma Critical Path—Data Quality Beats Volume by 2028.md]] | HIGH |
| Flatiron developed VALID Framework—"first comprehensive validation framework for model-extracted data in oncology" | [Flatiron: Can You Trust LLM-Extracted Data?](https://resources.flatiron.com/real-world-evidence/can-you-trust-real-world-data-extracted-by-a-large-language-model-llm) | HIGH |
| FDA 500+ AI submissions since 2016, released AI framework for drug development | [[2025-12-23-fda-proposes-framework-to-advance-credibility-of-a]] | HIGH |
| Raw data aggregators fail FDA requirements without validation infrastructure | [[Real-World Data Infrastructure Becomes Pharma Critical Path—Data Quality Beats Volume by 2028.md]] | HIGH |

**What FDA requires:**
1. **Computable phenotypes** — algorithmic patient population definitions
2. **Data validation** — accuracy, completeness, traceability documentation
3. **Distributed data networks** — federated queries across institutions
4. **Common Data Models** — standardized schemas (OMOP, Sentinel)
5. **QA/QC for regulatory submissions** — audit trails and provenance

**Why this creates a moat:**
- Volume without quality = rejected by FDA
- Quality infrastructure is hard to replicate (regulatory expertise + data relationships)
- Once FDA accepts your validation framework, switching costs are enormous

**SO WHAT:** The moat isn't owning data—it's owning the validated, FDA-accepted data pipeline. This is regulatory gatekeeping, not just switching costs.

**NOW WHAT:** Evaluate RWD players on FDA acceptance track record, not data volume.

### Mechanism 4: LLMs Commoditize Extraction, Making Validation the Moat

LLMs can extract insights from any data source. The competitive advantage shifts from data access to data validation.

**Evidence:**

| Claim | Source | Confidence |
|-------|--------|------------|
| "AI has turned data from a moat into a commodity. In vertical SaaS, real defensibility now comes from owning the workflow" | [Vendep: Forget the Data Moat](https://www.vendep.com/post/forget-the-data-moat-the-workflow-is-your-fortress-in-vertical-saas) | HIGH |
| Tempus launched LLM Agent Infrastructure (Agent Builder) for unstructured healthcare data | [Tempus: Advancing AI in Healthcare](https://www.tempus.com/resources/content/blog/advancing-the-frontier-of-ai-in-healthcare/) | HIGH |
| Flatiron: "LLMs can produce errors and hallucinations—robust validation approaches needed" | [Flatiron: LLM Data Trust](https://resources.flatiron.com/real-world-evidence/can-you-trust-real-world-data-extracted-by-a-large-language-model-llm) | HIGH |
| LLMs achieved 88-93% F1 on clinical NLP extraction | [[Automation in Clinical Trial Statistical Programming A Structured Review of TLF Generation, Validati]] | HIGH |

**The insight:**
- Before LLMs: Captive data = moat (only you can access it)
- After LLMs: Extraction commoditizes (anyone can pull insights from distributed sources)
- New moat: Validation that makes LLM-extracted data FDA-acceptable

**Tempus is trying to have both:**
- Diagnostics lock-in (test ordering relationships)
- Data licensing (access to 38M records)
- LLM infrastructure (Agent Builder)

But if extraction commoditizes, data licensing becomes commodity. Tempus survives on diagnostics, not data.

**SO WHAT:** The future RWD stack: LLMs for extraction → validation infrastructure for quality → regulatory acceptance for value. Validation layer captures the margin.

**NOW WHAT:** Watch for validation-as-a-service plays. This is the infrastructure bet.

## Who Wins, Who Loses

| Player | Current Position | What Happens | Why (Mechanism Link) |
|--------|------------------|--------------|----------------------|
| **Datavant** | $1B+ revenue, 300+ partners, neutral | Dominant RWD infrastructure layer; IPO at $10B+ | M2 (neutrality) + M3 (FDA quality) |
| **Aetion** (now Datavant) | 40+ biopharma, 80+ data partners | Integrated into Datavant; analytics layer on neutral data | M2 + M3 |
| **Tempus** | 38M records, $6B+ valuation | Survives on diagnostics lock-in; data licensing commoditizes | M4 (LLM commoditization) |
| **Flatiron** (Roche) | $3.2B impairment, sale explored | Divested or marginalized; ownership paradox unfixable | M1 (ownership paradox) |
| **Veeva RWD** | Compass, Link, Crossix | Strong in commercial analytics; less dominant in clinical RWD | M3 (regulatory focus) |
| **IQVIA RWD** | Massive claims/Rx data | Faces neutrality questions; large but not dominant | M1 + M2 |
| **Raw data aggregators** | Volume without validation | Commoditized; can't meet FDA quality requirements | M3 + M4 |

---

## Scenarios

| Case | Probability | What Happens | Trigger | Timeline |
|------|-------------|--------------|---------|----------|
| **Bull** | 35% | Datavant IPO at $15B+; FDA formalizes quality requirements aggressively; validation infrastructure becomes essential | FDA guidance accelerates; Datavant maintains neutrality post-IPO | 2027-2028 |
| **Base** | 45% | Datavant dominates infrastructure; Tempus holds diagnostics; Flatiron divested; 2-3 validation players emerge | Current trajectory continues; gradual FDA formalization | 2026-2028 |
| **Bear** | 20% | LLMs commoditize validation too; open-source quality frameworks emerge; infrastructure becomes utility | OpenAI/Anthropic release healthcare-specific validated extraction; FDA accepts general frameworks | 2028+ |

---

## What I'm Testing

| ID | Hypothesis | Prior | Current | Status | Evidence |
|----|------------|-------|---------|--------|----------|
| H1 | Captive data models lose to neutral infrastructure | 60% | 85% | **CONFIRMED** | Flatiron $3.2B impairment; Datavant $1B+ profitable |
| H2 | FDA will formalize RWD quality requirements | 70% | 80% | **LIKELY** | FDA AI framework; 500+ submissions since 2016 |
| H3 | LLMs commoditize data extraction | 65% | 75% | **LIKELY** | Tempus Agent Builder; 88-93% F1 on clinical NLP |
| H4 | Validation infrastructure captures margin | 55% | 70% | **PARTIALLY CONFIRMED** | Datavant profitable; Flatiron not |
| H5 | Tempus survives on diagnostics, not data | 50% | 65% | **LIKELY** | Dual model; diagnostics creates lock-in data doesn't |

---

## What Would Kill This

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Signal to Watch | By When |
|------|-------------|--------|-----------------|---------|
| Datavant loses neutrality post-IPO | 15% | HIGH | Strategic investor takes control; exclusive partnerships | 2027 |
| LLMs commoditize validation | 20% | HIGH | OpenAI/Anthropic healthcare validation frameworks | 2028 |
| FDA doesn't formalize quality requirements | 15% | MEDIUM | No new guidance on RWD for regulatory submissions | 2027 |
| Big tech enters (Google, Microsoft) | 20% | MEDIUM | Azure/GCP healthcare data infrastructure launches | 2026-2027 |
| Tempus pivots successfully to data + diagnostics bundle | 25% | MEDIUM | Tempus ARR growth from data licensing accelerates | 2026 |

**Strongest counter-argument:** If LLMs become good enough at validated extraction (hallucination detection, provenance tracking built-in), the validation layer commoditizes too. Open-source quality frameworks could make infrastructure a utility, not a moat.

**Why I still believe:** Regulatory acceptance is relationship-driven, not just technology-driven. FDA accepts Datavant's validation because of years of working relationship and audit trail. New entrants can't replicate this quickly.
