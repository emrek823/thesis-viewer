# Thesis: AI Biotech Model Licensing Captures SaaS Multiples—Drug Deals Become Software Deals by 2028

## Investment Take

**Consensus believes:** AI drug discovery companies are biotechs with AI. They should be valued on pipeline assets, milestone potential, and clinical risk—biotech multiples (3-5x revenue). The "AI" is a marketing wrapper on the same fundamental business: develop drugs, license to pharma, collect biobucks.

**Actually:** The January 2026 deals (GSK-Noetik, Chai-Lilly, Boltz-Pfizer) prove pharma will pay for *models*, not just *molecules*. This is a fundamental business model inversion:

| Old (Biobucks) | New (Model Licensing) |
|----------------|----------------------|
| Pay for drug candidates | Pay for computational tools |
| Milestone-gated revenue | Recurring subscription revenue |
| Binary clinical risk | Platform risk (lower variance) |
| 3-5x biotech multiples | 10-15x SaaS multiples |

**The arbitrage:** Same $50M ARR achieves $150-250M valuation as biotech vs. $500-750M as software. Chai Discovery raised at $1.3B on $225M funding with zero approved drugs—that's software economics.

**The mechanism:** Open-source foundation models (Boltz-1, Chai-1) create distribution and validation before monetization. Pharma pays for exclusive fine-tuning, enterprise deployment, and custom workflows—not base model access. Revenue becomes recurring (subscriptions, annual fees) not milestone-gated.

**In 5-10 years:**
- **Winners:** AI biotechs structured as software companies (ARR focus, model licensing, low clinical risk), data platforms that feed model training
- **Losers:** AI biotechs structured as traditional biotechs (pipeline-dependent, milestone-gated), companies that can't demonstrate pharma WTP for models
- **Market structure:** Bifurcation between "AI-as-infrastructure" (software multiples) and "AI-as-drug-discovery" (biotech multiples). The infrastructure players win on valuation.

**How this evolved:**
- *2026-01-08:* GSK-Noetik ($50M upfront for 5-year model license)—CEO calls it "a new paradigm in biotech: the licensing of human foundation models"
- *2026-01-08:* Boltz-Pfizer (exclusive model training on Pfizer data + custom workflows)
- *2026-01-09:* Chai-Lilly (platform deployment + purpose-built exclusive model)
- *2026-01-09:* Research synthesis confirmed pattern: biobucks → SaaS is real and investable

## Bull Case

### Deal Structure Evidence
- [x] **GSK pays $50M for models, not drugs.** 5-year subscription + data collaboration. Non-exclusive license to OCTO-VC virtual cell models. "A new paradigm for AI-focused biotech." ([[2026-01-09-ai-drug-discovery-model-licensing-sea-change]])
- [x] **Boltz-Pfizer: exclusive model training.** Pfizer pays for Boltz to refine models on Pfizer's historical data. Custom AI workflows for target programs. ([[2026-01-09-ai-drug-discovery-model-licensing-sea-change]])
- [x] **Chai-Lilly: platform deployment.** Lilly deploys Chai's platform internally + gets purpose-built exclusive model trained on Lilly data. ([[2026-01-09-ai-drug-discovery-model-licensing-sea-change]])
- [x] **Lilly TuneLab: reverse platform model.** Lilly *sells* AI model access to biotechs via federated learning. $1B+ data investment monetized as platform. ([[Lilly launches TuneLab platform]])

### Valuation Arbitrage Evidence
- [x] **Chai at $1.3B on zero approvals.** $225M total funding, valued at software multiples despite biotech risk profile. ([[2026-01-09-ai-drug-discovery-model-licensing-sea-change]])
- [x] **Boltz $28M seed with immediate pharma traction.** 100K+ scientists using models, Pfizer deal, PBC structure (won't develop drugs). ([[2026-01-09-ai-drug-discovery-model-licensing-sea-change]])
- [ ] **Noetik next funding round will test thesis.** If Series B prices at software multiples (>10x ARR equivalent), thesis validated.

### Business Model Evidence
- [x] **SaaS pricing emerging.** Nvidia: $4,500/GPU/year. 1910 Genetics: "Amazon Prime-like" molecule design subscription. Cradle: hybrid partnership + SaaS. ([[2026-01-09-ai-drug-discovery-model-licensing-sea-change]])
- [x] **Open-source → enterprise monetization.** Boltz-1, Chai-1 released open-source; monetize via exclusive fine-tuning and enterprise products. Hugging Face playbook for biotech. ([[2026-01-09-ai-drug-discovery-model-licensing-sea-change]])
- [x] **Recurring revenue structure.** GSK-Noetik: annual subscription fees. Lilly TuneLab: ongoing data exchange. Platform economics, not milestone economics.

## Bear Case

- [ ] **Clinical validation still required.** Zero AI-discovered drugs approved. If model-licensed drugs fail Phase II/III at same rates, pharma reverts to milestone-based deals where AI companies share clinical risk.
- [ ] **SaaS multiples require SaaS retention.** If pharma churns after initial model access (one-time value extraction), recurring revenue thesis collapses. NRR metrics will determine durability.
- [ ] **Open-source erodes pricing power.** Boltz and Chai released base models open-source. If pharma can fine-tune internally, premium for "exclusive" models disappears.
- [ ] **Pharma builds in-house.** Lilly TuneLab shows pharma can build AI capabilities internally. If build beats buy, licensing deals don't recur.
- [ ] **BenevolentAI template.** 90% valuation collapse when AI drug discovery hype met reality. If Chai or Noetik face clinical setbacks, software multiples evaporate overnight.
- [x] **Phase II bottleneck unchanged.** AI-discovered drugs show 80-90% Phase I success but Phase II still at 28.9%. AI speeds discovery, not development. If model licensing doesn't improve Phase II, pharma may revert to sharing clinical risk via milestones. ([[2026-01-09-ai-drug-discovery-model-licensing-sea-change]])

**The counter-thesis:** Model licensing is a temporary arbitrage. Pharma is experimenting with a new procurement model. Once they've extracted initial value and/or built internal capabilities, they'll either (a) revert to milestone-based deals that share clinical risk, or (b) bring AI in-house. The SaaS multiple window closes in 2-3 years.

## The Math

### Valuation Arbitrage
```
Same company, same $50M ARR:

Biotech structure (milestone-dependent):
  $50M × 3-5x multiple = $150-250M valuation
  High variance: $0 if trials fail, $500M+ if blockbuster

Software structure (recurring licensing):
  $50M × 10-15x multiple = $500-750M valuation
  Lower variance: predictable revenue, platform risk not clinical risk

Arbitrage: 2-3x on identical revenue
```

### Expected Value Comparison (10 Pharma Customers)
```
Traditional Drug Asset Deals:
  - 10 deals × $100M potential each
  - 30% probability of full payout (clinical success)
  - Expected value: $300M
  - But: huge variance ($0 to $1B+ range)

Model Licensing Deals:
  - 10 deals × $50M upfront + $10M/year subscription
  - 90% probability of renewal (platform stickiness)
  - Expected value: $500M + $90M/year recurring
  - Lower variance: revenue not gated on clinical outcomes
```

### Comparative Deal Structures
| Deal | Structure | Implication |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| Sanofi-Exscientia (2022) | $100M + $5.2B biobucks | Traditional: pay for drugs |
| Novartis-Generate (2024) | $1B+ milestone-heavy | Traditional: clinical risk shared |
| Recursion-Roche (2024) | $150M + $12B potential | Traditional: milestone-dependent |
| **GSK-Noetik (2026)** | $50M + 5-year subscription | **New: pay for models** |
| **Chai-Lilly (2026)** | Platform + exclusive model | **New: pay for capabilities** |
| **Boltz-Pfizer (2026)** | Exclusive fine-tuning | **New: pay for customization** |

## Timeline

**Now → 2026:**
- More $50M+ model licensing deals announced (watch for Recursion, Insitro pivots)
- AI biotech investor communications shift to ARR metrics
- First model licensing renewals test retention thesis
- Entry point: Companies restructuring from pipeline to platform narrative

**2027 → 2028:**
- Clear bifurcation: "AI infrastructure" vs "AI drug discovery" valuations
- First AI-discovered drug approval (or high-profile failure) tests whether model licensing decouples from clinical risk
- Inflection: Major AI biotech IPO prices at software multiples
- Pharma M&A targets shift to model/platform assets

**2029+:**
- Model licensing becomes standard procurement for pharma AI capabilities
- AI biotech market structure resembles enterprise software (platform leaders, vertical specialists)
- Clinical risk fully transferred to pharma; AI companies are infrastructure

## Startup Opportunities

**1. Model Licensing Infrastructure**
- Why this follows: Pharma needs MLOps, model deployment, fine-tuning infrastructure for licensed models
- Wedge: "Snowflake for pharma AI"—secure model deployment, usage metering, data isolation
- Risk: Hyperscalers (AWS, Azure) build pharma-specific offerings

**2. Open-Source Biotech Foundation Models**
- Why this follows: Boltz/Chai playbook—open-source for distribution, monetize enterprise
- Wedge: Release SOTA models, build community, convert to enterprise customers
- Risk: Requires continuous model improvement; one breakthrough can commoditize

**3. Pharma AI Procurement Platform**
- Why this follows: Pharma corp dev needs deal flow visibility for model licensing opportunities
- Wedge: Marketplace connecting AI biotechs with pharma buyers, standardized evaluation
- Risk: Deals are high-touch; marketplace disintermediated by relationships

---

## Watch For

**If RIGHT (thesis plays out):**
- 3+ more $50M+ model licensing deals in 2026
- AI biotech earnings calls emphasize ARR, NRR, platform metrics over pipeline milestones
- Noetik Series B prices at >$500M (10x+ on ~$50M implied ARR)
- First AI biotech IPO S-1 leads with software metrics, not clinical pipeline
- Pharma R&D budgets create "AI platform" line item separate from drug development

**If WRONG (thesis fails):**
- GSK-Noetik doesn't renew after initial term
- Chai or Noetik clinical setbacks trigger >50% valuation collapse (biotech risk profile)
- Pharma builds internal AI capabilities, reduces external licensing
- Model licensing deals revert to milestone-based structures
- AI biotech IPOs price at biotech multiples despite ARR narrative

## Open Questions

**Will NRR prove platform stickiness?**
→ OPEN: First renewal cycles (2027-2028) will determine if model licensing is recurring or one-time. If NRR <100%, SaaS thesis weakens.

**Does clinical failure contaminate model licensing valuations?**
→ OPEN: If Insilico INS018_055 fails Phase II, does Chai's valuation collapse even though Chai isn't developing drugs? Tests whether model licensing truly decouples from clinical risk.

**Can open-source sustain pricing power?**
→ OPEN: Boltz and Chai released base models. If pharma can fine-tune internally with open-source, "exclusive" model premiums disappear. Watch for pharma hiring ML talent vs. licensing.

**Will pharma create standard procurement for AI models?**
→ OPEN: If model licensing becomes routine (like SaaS procurement), market expands dramatically. If it stays bespoke/high-touch, market stays small.

**Does data geography create regional vs global markets?**
→ PARTIALLY ANSWERED: Model licensing competitive dynamics differ by modality:
- **Lab data (Boltz, Chai, XtalPi):** Global competition. Proteins fold the same everywhere. China's wet lab scale is real advantage.
- **Clinical outcome data (SMB, Tempus, Epic):** Regional moats. EHR data doesn't transfer (different coding, workflows). US data = US moat.
- **Genomics:** Limited transferability. European → African PRS: 20-40% accuracy retained. Ancestry-specific training required.
- **Imaging:** Partially portable but needs fine-tuning per population. Physics is universal, demographics aren't.

**Implication:** Model licensing companies in lab data face China competition. Clinical AI companies have geographic protection but must win within their region.
