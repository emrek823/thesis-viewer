## The Take

**$29.7B in AI drug discovery deal value in 2025, with upfront payments rising 9% to 27% of total.** AI biotech is no longer just hype—GSK paid $50M for Noetik's cancer foundation models, Lilly inked "one of pharma's largest AI software deals" with Chai, and Pfizer partnered with Boltz for exclusive model training. The shift from milestone-gated biobucks to recurring software licensing creates a 2-3x valuation arbitrage for companies that structure correctly.

**Mechanism:** Open-source foundation models (Boltz-1, Chai-1) create distribution and validation before monetization. Pharma pays for exclusive fine-tuning, enterprise deployment, and custom workflows—not base model access. The GSK-Noetik deal establishes the template: $50M upfront + subscription-based framework with annual licensing fees. This is SaaS economics applied to biotech: recurring revenue, platform risk (not clinical risk), and software multiples.

**Outcome:** AI biotechs structured as software companies (ARR focus, model licensing, low clinical risk) capture 10-15x revenue multiples vs. 3-5x for pipeline-dependent biotechs. Same $50M ARR achieves $500-750M valuation as software vs. $150-250M as biotech. Chai's $1.3B valuation on $225M funding with zero approved drugs proves the market is already pricing this in.

## Investment Take

**Today:** Model licensing is a real, investable business model—not a temporary arbitrage. GSK, Lilly, and Pfizer all signed model-first (not molecule-first) deals in January 2026. Noetik's CEO calls it "the first true foundation model licensing deal in biotech."

The AI in drug discovery market is projected to grow from $1.8B (2024) to $13.4B (2035). 120 AI-based discovery collaborations occurred in 2025—23% of all deals since 2017. The proportion of upfront payments rose to 27% of total deal value, approaching $800M with a median of $41M. Pharma is demonstrably willing to pay for models, not just molecules.

The January 2026 deals proved three structural shifts: (1) Pharma pays subscription fees for ongoing model access (GSK-Noetik), (2) Pharma deploys AI platforms across multiple targets rather than single-program deals (Chai-Lilly), (3) Pharma pays for exclusive fine-tuning on proprietary data (Boltz-Pfizer). This is the Hugging Face playbook for biotech: open-source for distribution, enterprise for revenue.

**In 3-5 years:** Clear bifurcation between "AI-as-infrastructure" companies (software multiples, recurring revenue, platform economics) and "AI-as-drug-discovery" companies (biotech multiples, pipeline-dependent, clinical risk). The infrastructure players win on valuation, exit optionality, and capital efficiency.

- **Winners:** AI biotechs structured as software companies (Noetik, Chai, Boltz), data platforms that feed model training, MLOps infrastructure for pharma
- **Losers:** AI biotechs still structured as traditional biotechs (pipeline-dependent, milestone-gated), companies that can't demonstrate pharma WTP for models, companies whose base models get commoditized
- **Market structure:** 36% of global AI platform licenses concentrated among 5 providers. First-mover advantage matters.

**How this evolved:**
- *2026-01-26:* **REBUILD** — Pressure tested with contrarian queries. Found HIGH threats around BenevolentAI/Exscientia collapses (90%/81% stock drops), Recursion clinical failures, open-source commoditization. Thesis CONFIRMED but confidence adjusted. Model licensing as new business model validated by Noetik CEO "first true foundation model licensing deal in biotech."
- *2026-01-13:* Added Benchling-Lilly TuneLab federated learning partnership—$1B+ Lilly data monetized to 1,300+ biotech companies
- *2026-01-08:* GSK-Noetik ($50M upfront for 5-year model license)—CEO calls it "a new paradigm in biotech"

## Bull Case

- [x] **GSK pays $50M for models, not drugs.** 5-year subscription + data collaboration. Non-exclusive license to OCTO-VC virtual cell models. "Among the first and largest transactions monetizing a biological foundation model as a scalable enterprise asset." ([[2026-01-08-gsk-noetik-sign-cancer-deal-on-ai-virtual-cell-mod]])
- [x] **Chai-Lilly: platform deployment across multiple targets.** Lilly deploys Chai's platform + gets purpose-built exclusive model trained on Lilly data. "One of pharma's largest AI software deals." Double-digit experimental hit rates vs. traditional methods. ([[2026-01-09-chai-discovery-announces-collaboration-with-eli-li]])
- [x] **Boltz-Pfizer: exclusive model training.** Pfizer pays for Boltz to build exclusive models on Pfizer's historical data. 100K+ scientists using Boltz models, Pfizer gets custom workflows. ([[2026-01-25-pharma-bets-big-on-ai-platforms-with-flurry-of-new]])
- [x] **Lilly TuneLab: pharma monetizes AI as platform.** Lilly sells AI model access to biotechs via federated learning. $1B+ data investment monetized as platform to 1,300+ biotech companies through Benchling. Proves pharma sees model licensing as both buy AND sell side. ([[2026-01-08-benchling-and-lilly-tunelab-partner-to-democratize]])
- [x] **Chai at $1.3B on zero approvals.** $225M total funding, valued at software multiples despite biotech risk profile. Investors believe "pharmaceutical companies that adopt this technology will absolutely leapfrog those who do not." ([[2026-01-09-chai-discovery-announces-collaboration-with-eli-li]])
- [x] **Isomorphic Labs signs third pharma partnership.** J&J deal (Jan 2026) follows Lilly and Novartis. AlphaFold 3 developer keeping models in-house while licensing to multiple pharma. ([[2026-01-25-pharma-bets-big-on-ai-platforms-with-flurry-of-new]])
- [x] **AI biotech valuation premium.** AI-native biotech companies fetch nearly 100% valuation premium over biopharma valuations broadly. VC invested $3.2B across 135 AI drug development startups in last 12 months.
- [ ] **Noetik Series B at software multiples.** If Series B prices at >$500M (10x+ on ~$50M implied ARR), thesis fully validated.

---

## Bear Case

- [x] **BenevolentAI 90% stock collapse.** Failed midphase eczema trial, laid off 180 staff, delisted from Euronext Amsterdam, merged with Osaka Holdings. First-generation AI drug discovery overpromised and underdelivered. ([[Labiotech: AI Biotech Bubble]])
- [x] **Exscientia 81% stock drop, merged with Recursion.** Despite multitarget collaborations with Bristol Myers Squibb and Sanofi. Sold to Recursion at fraction of prior market cap. ([[BioPharma Dive: Recursion Exscientia Merger]])
- [x] **Recursion discontinues lead programs.** REC-994 (cerebral cavernous malformation) and REC-2282 (neurofibromatosis type 2) discontinued after Phase II data showed only "trend" toward efficacy. Shares fell double digits. ([[STAT News: AI Drug Discovery Beginning or End]])
- [x] **Zero AI-discovered drugs FDA approved.** A decade in, not a single AI-born drug has been approved. Drug discovery is where "bits meet atoms"—biology is messier than chess or text prediction.
- [x] **Open-source erodes pricing power.** Boltz-1 and Boltz-2 released under MIT license—fully open for commercial use. 180 lines of code won Adaptyv Nipah competition. If pharma can fine-tune internally, "exclusive" model premiums disappear. ([[2026-01-09-180-lines-of-code-to-win-the-in-silico-portion-of]])
- [ ] **Phase II bottleneck unchanged.** AI-discovered drugs show 87.5% Phase I success (24 molecules, 21 successful by Dec 2023) but Phase II still ~30% historically. AI speeds discovery, not development.
- [ ] **Pharma builds in-house.** 40% of pharma leaders plan mixed internal/external AI; 30% prioritize in-house. Lilly building industry's most powerful AI supercomputer with Nvidia. If build beats buy, licensing deals don't recur.
- [ ] **NRR unproven.** First renewal cycles (2027-2028) will determine if model licensing is recurring or one-time. GSK-Noetik is 5-year deal—renewal not yet tested.

## The Counter Thesis

Model licensing is a temporary arbitrage. Pharma is experimenting with a new procurement model during an AI hype cycle. Once they've extracted initial value and/or built internal capabilities, they'll either (a) revert to milestone-based deals that share clinical risk, or (b) bring AI in-house entirely.

The evidence: Big Pharma's actual M&A strategy remains focused on validated drugs, not AI platforms. J&J paid $14.6B for Intra-Cellular Therapeutics, Merck spent $10B on Verona and $9.2B on Cidara, Novartis paid $12B for Avidity—all traditional biotechs with clinical-stage programs, not AI companies. They're building AI capabilities in-house through partnerships and infrastructure investments, then acquiring companies with proven late-stage molecules.

The real test: If GSK-Noetik doesn't renew in 2031, if Chai or Noetik clinical setbacks trigger BenevolentAI-style valuation collapse, if pharma hires ML talent instead of licensing—the "software multiples" window closes and these become biotech companies again.

## The Math

### Valuation Arbitrage
```
Same company, same $50M ARR:

Biotech structure (milestone-dependent):
  $50M × 3-5x multiple = $150-250M valuation
  High variance: $0 if trials fail, $500M+ if blockbuster

Software structure (recurring licensing):
  $50M × 10-15x multiple = $500-750M valuation
  Lower variance: predictable revenue, platform risk not clinical risk

Arbitrage: 2-3x on identical revenue
```

### Deal Structure Comparison (2022-2026)
| Deal | Year | Structure | Implication |
|------|------|-----------|-------------|
| Sanofi-Exscientia | 2022 | $100M + $5.2B biobucks | Traditional: pay for drugs |
| Recursion-Roche | 2024 | $150M + $12B potential | Traditional: milestone-dependent |
| **GSK-Noetik** | 2026 | $50M + subscription fees | **New: pay for models** |
| **Chai-Lilly** | 2026 | Platform + exclusive model | **New: pay for capabilities** |
| **Boltz-Pfizer** | 2026 | Exclusive fine-tuning | **New: pay for customization** |

### Market Size
- AI drug discovery market: $1.8B (2024) → $13.4B (2035), 16.5% CAGR
- AI in pharma: $4.35B (2025) → $25.37B (2030), 43% CAGR
- 120 AI-based discovery deals in 2025, $800M in upfront payments

## Timeline

**Now → 2026:**
- Watch for 3+ more $50M+ model licensing deals (Recursion, Insitro pivots)
- AI biotech investor communications shift to ARR metrics
- First model licensing renewals test retention thesis
- Entry point: Companies restructuring from pipeline to platform narrative
- Bioptimus ($76M raised, M-Optimus "first universal AI foundation model for biology") validates more entrants

**2027 → 2028:**
- First renewal cycles determine if NRR >100% (thesis validated) or churn (thesis weakens)
- First AI-discovered drug FDA approval (60% probability per industry estimates) or high-profile failure tests whether model licensing decouples from clinical risk
- Clear bifurcation: "AI infrastructure" vs "AI drug discovery" valuations
- Major AI biotech IPO prices at software multiples (if thesis right) or biotech multiples (if thesis wrong)

**2029+:**
- Model licensing becomes standard procurement for pharma AI capabilities
- Market structure resembles enterprise software: platform leaders, vertical specialists
- Clinical risk fully transferred to pharma; AI companies are infrastructure
- 36% concentration among top 5 providers intensifies

**If RIGHT:** Noetik Series B >$500M, 5+ $50M+ model licensing deals in 2026, AI biotech IPO S-1 leads with ARR/NRR metrics

**If WRONG:** GSK-Noetik doesn't renew, Chai valuation collapses >50% on clinical setback, pharma AI spending shifts to in-house, model licensing deals revert to milestone structures

## Startup Opportunities

**1. Model Licensing Infrastructure (MLOps for Pharma)**
- Why this follows: Pharma needs secure deployment, usage metering, data isolation for licensed models
- Wedge: "Snowflake for pharma AI"—multi-tenant model deployment, compliance, audit trails
- Risk: Hyperscalers (AWS, Azure) build pharma-specific offerings

**2. Open-Source Foundation Model Companies (Boltz/Chai Playbook)**
- Why this follows: Open-source for distribution, monetize via exclusive fine-tuning and enterprise products
- Wedge: Release SOTA models, build community, convert to enterprise customers
- Risk: Requires continuous model improvement; one breakthrough can commoditize. Federated OpenFold3 initiative (5 pharma companies pooling data) could accelerate commoditization

**3. Clinical Outcome Prediction Models (Noetik Playbook)**
- Why this follows: Lab data (protein folding) commoditizing via open-source; clinical outcome data has geographic moats
- Wedge: Train on EHR + imaging + genomics + pathology for trial design, enrollment prediction
- Risk: Requires proprietary clinical data partnerships; Tempus ($38M research records) already established

**4. Pharma AI Procurement Platform**
- Why this follows: Pharma corp dev needs deal flow visibility for model licensing opportunities as this becomes standard procurement
- Wedge: Marketplace connecting AI biotechs with pharma buyers, standardized evaluation
- Risk: Deals are high-touch; marketplace disintermediated by relationships

---

## Watch For

**If RIGHT (thesis plays out):**
- 3+ more $50M+ model licensing deals in 2026
- AI biotech earnings calls emphasize ARR, NRR, platform metrics over pipeline milestones
- Noetik Series B prices at >$500M (10x+ on ~$50M implied ARR)
- First AI biotech IPO S-1 leads with software metrics, not clinical pipeline
- Pharma R&D budgets create "AI platform" line item separate from drug development
- GSK-Noetik renewal at expanded terms (2027+)

**If WRONG (thesis fails):**
- GSK-Noetik doesn't renew after initial term (2031)
- Chai or Noetik clinical setbacks trigger >50% valuation collapse (biotech risk profile despite software structure)
- Pharma builds internal AI capabilities, reduces external licensing (Lilly supercomputer with Nvidia is signal)
- Model licensing deals revert to milestone-based structures
- AI biotech IPOs price at biotech multiples despite ARR narrative
- Open-source models (Boltz-2, OpenFold3) fully commoditize base capabilities

## Open Questions

**Will NRR prove platform stickiness?**
→ OPEN: First renewal cycles (2027-2028) will determine if model licensing is recurring or one-time. If NRR <100%, SaaS thesis weakens. GSK-Noetik 5-year term means first data point in 2031.

**Does clinical failure contaminate model licensing valuations?**
→ OPEN: If Insilico INS018_055 fails Phase II (showed positive Phase IIa results in IPF), does Chai's valuation collapse even though Chai isn't developing drugs? BenevolentAI template (90% drop) vs. true software decoupling tests whether model licensing truly separates from clinical risk.

**Can open-source sustain pricing power?**
→ PARTIALLY ANSWERED: Boltz-1/2 released under MIT license. 180 lines of code won Adaptyv competition. BUT: Pharma still paying Boltz for exclusive fine-tuning on proprietary data. The moat may be data + fine-tuning services, not base model capabilities. Federated OpenFold3 initiative (5 pharma companies pooling data) could accelerate commoditization.

**Will pharma build beats buy?**
→ OPEN: 40% of pharma leaders plan mixed internal/external AI strategies. Lilly building supercomputer with Nvidia ($1B partnership). But Lilly also signed Chai deal—suggesting even builders still buy. Watch hiring patterns: if pharma ML talent acquisition accelerates, licensing model weakens.

*Confidence: MEDIUM — Deal evidence strong (GSK-Noetik, Chai-Lilly, Boltz-Pfizer all signed in Jan 2026), but thesis depends on renewals (unproven until 2027+) and decoupling from clinical risk (BenevolentAI/Exscientia collapses suggest market still punishes AI biotechs for clinical failures). Open-source commoditization threat is real but companies finding moats in fine-tuning services.*

*Last rebuilt: 2026-01-26*
*Contrarian threats: BenevolentAI 90% collapse, Exscientia 81% drop, Recursion clinical failures, open-source commoditization (180 LOC won Nipah competition). Addressed: These were pipeline-dependent companies (traditional biotech structure), not model-licensing-focused companies (software structure). The thesis is specifically about structuring as software, not AI drug discovery broadly.*
