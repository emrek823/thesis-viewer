# CodaMetrix (CMX)

CodaMetrix (CMX) is a SaaS technology company providing an AI-powered platform to facilitate healthcare revenue cycle management and coding. The CMX platform combines Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to autonomously code Professional Billing (PB) cases.

By the end of 2022, CMX will be in use at several large provider organizations serving over 145 hospitals. The current CMX solutions in radiology and pathology are on schedule to expand to modules for surgery, gastroenterology, inpatient professional billing, and emergency department services during 2023.

# Medical Coding    CODAMETRIX

## $9.5 billion Total Addressable Market (TAM) w/ 7% CAGR
- Physicians’ reimbursement is determined by codes, and revenue integrity is dependent on coding quality.

### Highly manual, complicated and messy workflow
- Existing NLP-centric automation solutions are expensive, brittle, not easy to deploy, and max out at automating 50% of the volume.

### The costliest part of Revenue Cycle Management (RCM)
- Coding costs represent 25% of the total cost of RCM.
- Doctors hate coding their own cases, and end up memorizing a handful of codes that reflect their routine visits, without sufficient clinical specificity.

### Professional coders are highly paid ($25-35 / hr.)
- Many are retiring, causing 20% open positions.
- Claims coding data is notoriously inadequate because fee-for-service coding standard is medical necessity vs. population health that requires clinical specificity.

### Medical coding drives more than just RCM
- (CPT, ICD-10,…)
- Reimbursement &#x26; Revenue
- Risk Adjustment &#x26; Quality Measures
- Prior-Authorization and Utilization Management
- Care Gaps and Care Plans
- Research and Patient Recruitment for Clinical Trials

# Origins and Background

## CODAMETRIX

The Massachusetts General Physician Organization (MGPO) developed Integrated Coding Module (ICM), which is a CAC (Computer Assisted Coding) used by MGPO’s physician billing organization to code millions of claims per year (2005-2018).

CodaMetrix (CMX) was founded in 2019 to develop a new commercially viable generation of the solution based on AI and cloud technologies.

### ROI of the CMX Platform at MGB:
- **30% Cost Savings**

# CMX-Adjudicateᵀᴹ
## CODAMETRIX

### A Transformative Opportunity

#### The Problem
In a predominantly fee-for-service reimbursement environment, coding is focused on meeting payers’ “medical necessity” requirements. This requires specialty specific modules and data.

With the proliferation of value-based care payment systems, population health analytics and quality measures, and auto adjudication of claims at the point of care, coding will require clinical detail and specificity. Those requirements will make manual coding time intensive and cost prohibitive.

#### The Solution
AI-powered autonomous coding with trained models to code with high quality clinical specificity, which requires training AI models on a specialty-by-specialty basis.
