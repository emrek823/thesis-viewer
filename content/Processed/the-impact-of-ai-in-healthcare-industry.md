The emergence of AI in healthcare has been transforming, redefining the way we diagnose, monitor, and treat patients. This cutting-edge technology is driving massive innovation in the industry, facilitating rapid advancements in drug discovery and development while empowering healthcare professionals to provide enhanced and expedited care.

The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has further pushed the healthcare industry to adopt AI. The pandemic supported the widespread adoption and advancements of AI-based healthcare, enabling their effective utilization in diagnosis, detection, patient care, clinical trials, claims settlement, and virtual assistants.

According to Statista, AI in healthcare was worth around $11 billion worldwide in 2021 and is estimated to reach $188 billion by 2030, increasing at a CAGR of 37% from 2022 to 2030.

AI in healthcare can immensely benefit providers and patients in different areas of operations, including improved patient care, chronic disease management, early risk identification, workflow automation, and optimization. Another example of similar technology integration is regarding telemedicine. Telemedicine is transforming healthcare delivery, especially in areas like mental health care where access remains limited. These transformative benefits of telemedicine in mental health care is a profound example of healthcare-technology infusion.

In this article, we will look into artificial intelligence at length to get an idea of how AI is used in healthcare and how the technology will reshape the industry in the future.

Real-World Examples and Use Cases of AI in Healthcare

From making an accurate diagnosis to maximizing hospital efficiency, AI and healthcare go hand in hand, redefining the industry in various forms. Here are a few ways AI is revolutionizing the healthcare industry and driving it toward digital transformation.

1. Offering Robot-Assisted Surgery

It is one of the most common applications of AI in healthcare. AI and collaborative robots have revolutionized surgical procedures, reducing the risks of blood loss, pain, and other side effects. Furthermore, with AI in healthcare, surgeons can perform complex surgeries with greater accuracy, leading to faster and smoother post-surgery recovery for patients.

For instance, Maastricht University Medical Center has been utilizing AI-powered robots to suture small blood vessels, some no thicker than 0.03 millimeters. Using AI in medicine and healthcare, surgeons can access real-time information and insights into a patient’s current health condition. This AI-backed information enables healthcare providers to make prompt, intelligent decisions before, during, and after procedures to ensure the best outcomes.

2. Detecting Fraud

The US Justice Department states that 3% of healthcare claims in the country are fraudulent. It translates into a $100 billion loss annually. With AI-based healthcare, professionals can detect invalid claims and speed up the processing, approval, and payment of valid ones. Apart from detecting insurance fraud, AI in healthcare also prevents patient data from being stolen.

Leading healthcare service providers such as Harvard Pilgrim Health are embracing AI to root out healthcare fraud. They use AI-based fraud detection systems to identify claims and detect suspicious behavior.

3. Supporting Clinical Decisions

AI and ML in healthcare are changing the way clinical providers make decisions. AI delivers data to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing, treatment planning, and health management. The technology also supports decisions in data-intensive specialties like ophthalmology, radiology, and pathology. It may even make it possible to perform certain tasks autonomously using AI in the near future. With natural language processing, AI can also help translate clinical notes in EHRs, enabling clinicians to enter data once only once.

Healthcare organizations that hire AI strategy consultants ensure clinical decision systems are aligned with compliance, patient safety, and long-term business goals.

4. Assisting in Repetitive Jobs

Healthcare is now moving towards the Cognitive Assistants world, which comes with the capabilities of reasoning, analytics, and a complete range of medical knowledge. The recently launched algorithm, Medical Sieve, has been stated qualified to assist in cardiology and radiology decisions. The cognitive health assistant analyzes the radiology images to detect issues faster and more reliably.

Medical Sieve is one of the best examples of AI in healthcare. However, there are other examples also, like Enlitic, which aims to mix deep learning with medical data to aid advanced diagnostics and improve patient care.

5. Changing Online and In-Person Consultations

Babylon App is a real-world example of how AI applications in healthcare can change doctor consultations. The app offers online medical consultation and healthcare services, providing the best AI advice based on a patient’s medical history and available knowledge.

This AI-based app works in a way that the users only have to report the symptoms of their illness, and the app then checks the symptoms against the database of the diseases using the speech recognition method. After noting the patient’s history and circumstances, they offer a course of action that the patient should take.

The ever increasing demand for healthcare apps incorporating AI technology is evident from the fact that over 54% mHealth app users are willing to engage with AI and Robotics for their IT healthcare consulting needs. This AI trend highlights the growing popularity and acceptance of AI solutions in healthcare.

6. Medication Management and Health Assistance

Sense.ly, a medical startup, developed the world’s first digital nurse, Molly. The virtual nurse has a friendly face and pleasant voice, aiming to monitor the condition and treatment of patients. The mobile app uses machine learning to support patients with chronic conditions during the intervals between their medical appointments. The app provides tested, customized monitoring and follow-up care, focusing on chronic diseases. Being present to inform patients when to take medications and then monitoring if they did, the benefits of artificial intelligence in healthcare are immensely valuable.

7. Drug Creation

Creating pharmaceuticals using clinical trials can take over a decade and even cost billions. Introducing AI to drug creation doesn’t just make the process faster but also extremely cost-effective.

Atomwise is one such network that uses supercomputers, which roots out therapy from molecular structure databases. In 2015, Atomwise used its AI technology to discover the existing medicines in the market that could be redesigned for treating the Ebola virus. They found two drugs that could help solve the epidemic. The analysis that would have taken years happened in one day through Atomwise AI technology.

8. Precision Medicine

AI in medicine has a big impact on genomics and genetics. AI use in healthcare aids in identifying patterns in massive data sets containing medical records and genetic information, helping find links to diseases and mutation.  No wonder AI can tell doctors what happens in the cell when DNA is changed through genetic variation, whether therapeutically or naturally.

10. Automating Image Diagnosis

One of the most remarkable applications and benefits of AI in healthcare is the computer vision capabilities. Hospitals and clinics use AI to recognize abnormalities in different kinds of medical images as CT or radiology scans. Image recognition assists doctors in diagnosing tumors, kidney, and liver infections, improving cancer prognosis, and more. Furthermore, AI in dentistry leverages these same computer vision technologies to carefully analyze dental radiographs and 3D scans, enabling early detection of cavities, gum diseases, and other subtle oral health issues for more accurate and timely treatment.

The best example of AI-powered visual perception is the tool used at the UVA University Hospital. Utilizing AI and ML in healthcare, the tool analyzes children’s biopsy images to distinguish between environmental enteropathy and celiac disease, doing it as reliably as doctors do.
