## Slide 1: Basetwo - Building digital twins for manufacturing just got easier.

**Logo & Title:**
Basetwo
Building digital twins for manufacturing just got easier.

**Image Description:**
An illustration depicting a modern pharmaceutical or chemical manufacturing plant. On the left, there's laboratory equipment, including test tubes with colorful liquids and various chemical structures floating. On the right, a production line with bottles moving along a conveyor belt, leading to a packing station where two masked workers are handling boxes labeled "VACCINE". Pills and other medical items are scattered around. The overall aesthetic is clean and stylized with a purple and green color scheme.
