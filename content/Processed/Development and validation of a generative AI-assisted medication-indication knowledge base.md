## Abstract

BackgroundExisting information resources about medicines and their indications have limited usefulness for health data analytics. The emerging potential of large language models (LLMs) to generate clinically accurate responses presents a novel opportunity to develop a comprehensive knowledge base of medicines and their clinical indications.

MethodUnique medications from the English Prescribing Dataset (EPD) were extracted and included in a fine-tuned prompt pipeline using the GPT-4 and MedCAT LLMs. The resulting database underwent clinical validation by three clinicians to calculate the precision for a sample of the knowledge base. This was followed by external validation using the participant reported indications included in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) dataset, a large-scale population health survey in the United States (US).

Results1,540 unique medications from the EPD were used to generate 10,853 unique medication-indication pairs. Initial threshold-based investigations of accuracy across LLM generated confidence scores for each pair revealed that a threshold of 0.75 was an optimal trade-off between error rate and knowledge base size. Common types of error which had to be addressed in the pipeline included duplications, alternative spellings and medical synonyms. A random subset of 465 medication-indication pairs was selected for clinical validation, of which 418 were assessed to be correct (a precision of 89.9%). External validation using the NHANES overall agreement of 84% (210 out of 250). Of the remaining 40, only 2 were valid indications omitted in the knowledge base, whilst the rest were judged by clinical reviewers to be off-licence indications (n=7) or appeared to be incorrectly reported by survey participants (n=31).

ConclusionThe AI-assisted medication-indication knowledge base demonstrated high precision and external validity. The coverage of off-licence indications adds to the potential of this knowledge base in various biomedical applications such as real-world evidence research, drug discovery and adverse event detection.
