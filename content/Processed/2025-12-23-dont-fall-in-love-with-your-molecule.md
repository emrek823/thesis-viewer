### Forward

> *Technical success—lovely, but inadequate.*

Bluebird Bio achieved a scientific triumph in 2022 when the FDA [approved](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/zynteglo) its lead asset Zynteglo, a first-of-its-kind gene therapy offering curative potential for transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia (TDT). Since Zynteglo’s launch, however, Bluebird’s stock (BLUE) has fallen 97%, and the company was ultimately [taken private](https://investor.bluebirdbio.com/news-releases/news-release-details/carlyle-and-sk-capital-receive-all-required-regulatory-approvals) for roughly $30 million—a far cry from the biotech’s peak valuation of $10 billion.

Bluebird was an excellent organization filled with brilliant scientists and skilled operators. However, its story offers an opportunity to understand what went wrong and how emerging biotechs can more effectively navigate commercial pitfalls.

Despite groundbreaking science, Zynteglo failed to gain commercial traction—not because it didn’t work, but because it entered a healthcare system unprepared to reimburse the $2.8 million list price.

The key foot fault was the **target product profile (TPP)**. Although Bluebird’s TPP addressed a large clinical unmet need and accurately anticipated regulatory approval, it failed to align clinical ambition with market access and reimbursement hurdles.

Today’s biotech ecosystem overemphasizes technical success. Claims like, “*Our platform technology increases the probability of technical success by 20%*” ring hollow against a backdrop where [only half](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41573-022-00213-z) of FDA-approved molecules recoup their R&D investments. Technical success is a necessary, but insufficient condition for building an enduring biotech.

Early, frequent, and rigorous TPP construction is crucial for calibrating R&D efforts to commercial realities—*such as pricing tolerance and payer readiness*—ensuring that drugs achieve both technical ***and*** market success.

### Origin of the Target Product Profile

> *Nearly twenty years ago, the FDA consolidated a patchwork of internal, pharma working documents into the original incarnation of the TPP.*

While TPPs vary between organizations, the modern framework captures essential information about a product’s intended population, differentiation from the established standard of care (SoC), administration and dosing considerations, and market access insights. TPPs are ubiquitous today—but this wasn’t always the case.

Decades ago, pharma companies used a fragmented mix of internal target labels and regulatory briefing documents to guide drug development. These tools lacked standardization, version control, digitization, and mechanisms for cross-functional collaboration between R&D and commercial teams. Early guiding frameworks often omitted market access strategy altogether.

The FDA formalized the concept in its [2007 draft guidance](https://www.biopharminternational.com/view/fda-drafts-guidance-target-product-profiles-and-issues-2007-agenda), positioning the TPP as a tool to help sponsors “*begin with the end in mind*”. Ideally, the TPP bridges development and regulatory planning—clarifying intent-to-treat sub-populations, efficacy targets, safety margins, and more, each supported by a clear trail of preclinical data.

### Industry Pushback and Modernization

> *The modern TPP is a data-driven dashboard meant to serve as a substrate for debate and decision making.*

Initially, there was industry pushback. Pharma companies were concerned that TPP claims might be seen as binding or interpreted as overly promotional. Many drug developers rightly pointed out that the FDA’s draft guidance was intended to galvanize regulatory efficiency—not to ensure commercial success. This perceived gap drove the modernization of the TPP into something more than a regulatory artifact. TPPs are now business plans in disguise.

Today’s TPPs are highly dynamic, data-fed tools that help nimble teams develop drug products addressing clinical and commercial gaps. Against a highly competitive backdrop, TPPs are moving targets, informed by constant shifts in the global development landscape and scientific breakthroughs alike.

Modern TPPs often include both minimal and preferred outcomes, a precedent [popularized](https://www.who.int/observatories/global-observatory-on-health-research-and-development/analyses-and-syntheses/target-product-profile/who-target-product-profiles?utm_source=chatgpt.com) by the World Health Organization (WHO) and now widely adopted across industry. Compared to earlier versions, TPPs are now intended to serve diverse audiences, including patients, clinicians, regulators, payers, pharmas, biotechs, investors, health technology assessment (HTA) bodies, and others.

Below is an example of what a modern-day TPP may look like along with suggestions for how to fill one out:

### Deciphering Some Examples

> *For either molecule to succeed commercially, the convenience and tolerability advantages must produce clinical outcomes that matter to patients, providers, and payers.*

In highly saturated therapeutic areas, successful differentiation hinges on a nuanced understanding of what truly matters to patients, clinicians, and payers. Below are two illustrative examples of how different product profiles aim to carve out space in competitive environments—one through **delivery convenience** and the other through **safety optimization**.

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!IphQ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc0431da9-f915-4b68-9d1e-ef8e000803a5_1320x676.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!IphQ!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc0431da9-f915-4b68-9d1e-ef8e000803a5_1320x676.png)

In the rapidly evolving multiple myeloma landscape, BCMA is a [well-validated](https://www.mymyelomateam.com/resources/what-is-bcma-targeted-immunotherapy-for-multiple-myeloma#:~:text=BCMA%2Dtargeted%20therapies%20are%20approved,then%20the%20blood%20cancer%20returns.) target. Several high-efficacy therapies are already approved or in late-stage development, including CAR-Ts, bispecifics, and antibody-drug conjugates. However, many of these treatments are logistically complex—requiring intravenous (IV) administration, hospitalization, or specialized centers.

This hypothetical, oral BCMA inhibitor aims to differentiate by offering an at-home alternative, reducing treatment burden and improving access for a broader patient population. The convenience of a pill—especially for relapsed/refractory patients with limited mobility or other logistical constraints—could drive wider adoption. Still, in a space dominated by potent biologics, clinical performance must clear a high bar to gain meaningful market traction.

*[Lerociclib](https://www.medchemexpress.com/G1T38.html?srsltid=AfmBOoqOiJ2u1Z6bbpKyuuJmb3VZcz0d3OtXFbQsy08QBH539jh8BGr5)*, an oral, highly selective CDK4/6 inhibitor, takes a different angle—refined tolerability. The program emphasizes a continuous daily dosing strategy in combination with fulvestrant, aiming to deliver efficacy on par with other CDK4/6–endocrine therapy combinations.

The molecule’s core differentiator lies in reducing the toxicity burden commonly associated with the drug class. Early [data](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11739584/) suggest lower rates of Grade 4 neutropenia, gastrointestinal adverse events, fatigue, stomatitis, and alopecia—side effects that often constrain adherence or impair quality of life. If these results hold in larger trials, lerociclib may appeal to patients and clinicians prioritizing long-term safety and tolerability.

CDK4/6 inhibitors like palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib are deeply entrenched, with substantial clinical and real-world data. For lerociclib to succeed, its safety advantages must translate into outcomes that influence not just clinical theory, but real-world prescribing behavior and payer decisions.

### A Tale of Two TPP Construction Philosophies

> *Each philosophy has merit and has produced commercially impactful drugs.*

There are two basic strategies for building an initial TPP—**top-down** and **bottom-up**. Both seek to bridge molecules and markets, but they begin from different starting points.

**Top-down strategies** start by identifying intersections of clinical unmet need and commercial tractability. Organizations then hone in on novel or underserved biological pathways that may address these market opportunities. With a target hypothesis in hand, technical leaders converge on the best modality, pharmacology, and molecule.

Consider the success of CAR-T cell therapy for hematological malignancies which followed this approach. Historically, patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell cancers (*e.g.,* acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)) had few options following chemotherapy and stem cell transplant failure. Oncologists had long recognized this treatment gap, but lacked a viable solution until scientists discovered how to reprogram T-cells to recognize and destroy cancer cells.

Instead of starting with “we need a CAR-T therapy,” companies like Novartis (Kymriah) and Gilead (Yescarta) worked closely with oncologists and hematologists to understand which cancers were most likely to benefit from CAR-T therapy. They honed in on CD19 as an ideal target antigen given it’s widely expressed on B-cells and had limited off-target toxicity concerns. This top-down approach, which started with a clearly defined unmet need and mapped backward to a druggable target, catalyzed a revolution in personalized cancer treatment.

**Bottom-up strategies** begin with targets and molecules. Teams winnow the target space by considering what a drug modality or technology platform can best address. Can the molecule access intracellular or only secreted targets? Can it be administered orally or only parenterally? Is the discovery platform excellent at tuning selectivity within a certain target family?

Armed with a refined target list, teams scour the disease landscape for pathophysiologies involving those targets. Finally, multi-stakeholder input helps match indications to underserved patient populations with both clinical urgency and commercial potential.

The development of a gene therapy for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) embodies this approach. SMA is a devastating genetic disease [caused by mutations](https://www.mda.org/disease/spinal-muscular-atrophy/causes-inheritance) in the SMN1 gene, leading to progr
