### MSK Partnership & Technical Progress

- MSK collaboration data benchmarking and training completed
	- Core pathology dataset from MSK showing strong results
	- New training dataset significantly richer than initial benchmark
	- Brand approval process for MSK name usage expected to be straightforward
- Second blog post demonstrates state-of-the-art performance predicting outcomes in cancer
	- Goal: every AI researcher in cancer should benchmark against this model
	- Strategy to make it “bad practice” not to fine-tune their model

### Strategic Focus & Academic Medical Center Partnerships

- Sanofi POC progressing well with full contract closure expected March-April
	- $4.8M additional to $360K POC, viewed as low risk
	- Delays only related to personnel onboarding/offboarding timelines
- AMC partnerships prioritized for validation and testing speed
	- MSK, Yale, MD Anderson providing website quotes
	- Two projects with UCSD underway
	- Mount Sinai collaboration with Ben Glicksberg expanding (https://scholars.mssm.edu/en/persons/benjamin-glicksberg)
		- Started with whole exome sequencing
		- Potential SBIR and ARPA grant collaborations discussed
- Reducing AMC onboarding time critical
	- MD Anderson: several calls initially, then 2-3 hours to surpass previous state-of-the-art
	- Yale: down to one hour conversation to get them using model
	- Target: 2-3 minutes with install script for smaller model versions
- Mayo Clinic wants in-person visit by end of year

### Industry Pipeline & Business Development

- GSK meeting with Kim Branson scheduled for next week
- IQVIA proposal submitted via Nvidia introduction
	- $44M including compute services with milestone structure
	- First milestone: $1M, subsequent milestones larger
	- Data licensing concerns around model weights discussed
- Tempest meetings at JPM with Eric Lakovsky and Ryan Fukushima (Pathos co-founder)
	- Strategy: position SMB as first call when inflection point happens
	- Most rejections not due to competitors, but companies still believing they’ll build internally
- Real-world data vendor dynamics
	- Companies like Dandelion concerned about revenue cannibalization
	- Kaleidoscope Foundation growing 90% year-over-year but worried about data licensing impact
	- Genentech internal AI efforts described as “embarrassing” by recent departure

### Product Development & Technical Roadmap

- Genomics work expanding from breast cancer to pan-cancer with UCSD collaboration (30 hours/week free work)
- All modalities converging into single standard model
	- Patient notes, genomics, longitudinal EHR, radiology, pathology
	- Three model sizes for distribution
	- Led by Zach, unified approach enforced across all partnerships
- Major data acquisition: 1M oncology CTs from Gradient for $150K
	- Delivery expected December 29th
	- One week training timeline anticipated
	- Radiology chosen as standard of care longitudinal modality

### Fundraising Strategy & Market Positioning

- Current runway: 10.9 months
- Not formally fundraising but open to January raise
- Preference for early fundraising to accelerate AMC partnerships and data licensing
- Two potential paths discussed:
- JPM meetings scheduled with:
	- Lux, GV, North Pond, Pioneer
	- Mix of cold inbound and warm introductions
	- Half business development, half investor conversations

### Long-term Vision & Competitive Positioning

- Flywheel strategy requires market leverage position
	- Companies pay in dollars or provide data access for model usage
	- Goal: make performance so superior that not using SMB model risks regulatory approval
- Foundation model scaling across verticals vs. single vertical approach
	- Learned from Symbiosis experience: can’t build vertically and scale out
	- Companies like Adaraxis building breast cancer-only solutions face same scaling challenges
- Team credibility building through LinkedIn presence and technical publications
	- Addressing perception issues around non-big tech backgrounds
	- Emphasizing world-class technical talent over brand names
