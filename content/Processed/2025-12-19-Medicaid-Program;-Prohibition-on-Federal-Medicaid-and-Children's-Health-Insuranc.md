## Summary
This proposed rule would prohibit federal Medicaid and CHIP funding for 'sex-rejecting procedures' for children under 18-19, effectively blocking gender-affirming medical interventions for transgender youth. The policy would restrict state Medicaid programs from using federal dollars to pay for these medical treatments.

## Startup Angle
This policy creates potential opportunities for:     1. Legal/policy consulting startups specializing in healthcare regulatory navigation, helping providers understand complex compliance requirements     2. Telehealth platforms focused on alternative care pathways for transgender youth      3. Mental health technology companies offering support services for LGBTQ+ youth          Potential negative impact on:     1. Telehealth startups specifically focused on gender-affirming care     2. Digital health platforms providing comprehensive transgender youth healthcare services      Specific startup example: A platform like Folx Health or Plume might need to dramatically redesign their youth-focused service models to comply with potential state-level restrictions.
