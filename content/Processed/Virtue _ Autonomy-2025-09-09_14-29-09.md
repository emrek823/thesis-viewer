### Current Business Strategy

- Three core business pillars solving for automation, infusions, and payer contracts
	- Automation enables adding infusions to smaller practices
	- Infusions provide market density
	- Density unlocks better payer contracts
- Target market: 80% of neurology groups not vertically integrated vs 20% that are
	- Vertically integrated: focus on workflow automation
	- Smaller practices: help launch revenue-generating service lines

### Product Development & Roadmap

- Prior authorization agent launched with Texas Neurology
	- Currently tweaking based on feedback
	- On track to present to 20-practice neurology consortium October 1st week
	- Strong customer interest: “When’s it coming out? Can we demo it?”
- Referral intake second priority
	- Working with Valerie on combined solution
	- Clinical summarization vendor integration
- Billing automation third focus
	- Clean claims scrubbing with Texas Neurology
	- Denial management module in development

### EMR Platform Strategy

- Next 60 days: selecting EMR platform to build on (Athena leading candidate)
- Need first practice willing to migrate to Athena
	- Manhattan clinic option fell through
	- Two contenders: North Carolina (7-8 providers) and Florida practices
	- North Carolina most likely - established relationship since August 2023
- 4-6 month migration timeline once practice commits
- Goal: create case study for broader consortium pitch

### October Neurology Consortium Opportunity

- 20 largest neurology groups in US meeting in Savannah
- Audience includes practices from Dent down to Texas Neurology size
- All have Botox, 70-80% have infusions
- Pitching auth solution + potentially referral/billing workflows
- Launching Circle community platform for broader engagement

### Engineering Hiring Progress

- Two candidates in final technical rounds
	- Junior engineer from Epic/Undo Software (infusion management background)
	- Mid-level with architectural experience
- Gap identified: need 5-7 year experience senior engineer
	- Current candidates either too junior (need management) or too senior (CTO-level)
	- Cultural fit critical: 4+ days in office, ready to grind
- Compensation range: $125-200k cash (equity less important to candidates)
- Timeline pressure: need someone building immediately vs managing
