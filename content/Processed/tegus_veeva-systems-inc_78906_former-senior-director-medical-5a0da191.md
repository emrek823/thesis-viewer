**Tegus Client**
Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today about the drug commercialization space. To start off, could you please give us a quick overview of your background and experience in this space?

**Former Senior Director, Medical Affairs at Apellis Pharmaceuticals**
Yes. So -- thanks. I am a Head of Medical Affairs at a small biotech. I've been working in the kind of small rare disease space for going on just about over a decade now, launching multiple assets in cystic fibrosis, rare hematological conditions and neurology.

And I'd say in the realm of companies sizing from 20 through about 400 and prior to this, I've been working at kind of larger biotech pharma style companies in the gamut of three commercialization assets through all the way through life cycle management for products that have been in the market for 20 years.

**Tegus Client**
Great. And in those experiences, what have you seen in terms of the most key lessons in terms of making commercialization successful and what were the most common pitfalls you've seen in terms of failures?

**Former Senior Director, Medical Affairs at Apellis Pharmaceuticals**
Yes. So living in a world right now where there's constraints on funding and resources overall just because there are so many different companies and so many smaller companies that are trying to put assets out in a short period of time, I would say the biggest learning for me is that getting out early, especially being in med affairs, getting out early within the development program to build out the community and patient identification is absolutely essential.

And there are kind of the things that I've seen where people have dropped is building out that commercialization infrastructure too late. I would say if you're saying what time would that be, I would say, if you haven't started building out the commercialization infrastructure by the time you get to full enrollment of your Phase III programs, the very latest, you're probably in trouble.

**Tegus Client**
Can you break that down a little bit more, what is it that is so critical to in place in terms of infrastructure ahead of time?

**Former Senior Director, Medical Affairs at Apellis Pharmaceuticals**
Yes. So I -- for me, I think the most important aspects to have with respect to the infrastructure really comes down to making sure that you have your medical commercial launch build plans and what your strategy is going to be to start that probably two to three years out from your planned commercialization.

I think just knowing this is what the organization will need for processes, for resources, which include not just what your expected, say, field teams and internal teams are going to be, but also your systems, making sure that your appropriate systems for commercialization, like CRMs, reviewing platforms, et cetera, are built out. You want to have those, I would say, getting up to speed. So like a medical-legal review process, you want to have that started shortly after the enrollment has finished for your studies and you're building out your disease state education materials.

I think one key learning to -- kind of go back to learning is you need to start doing disease state education learning or disease state engagement with the community after enrollment, especially depending on what the disease is, if it's unknown. You need to take a lot there and highlight. So there's patient identification efforts if you were in a competitive space in a rare disease, for example, you're going to need to make sure that you are educating on the uniqueness of not only the product, but the role that the company needs to play as a partner within the community.

And that's something that needs to be prepped out at least 18 months before you're getting to launch, two years before launch. So thinking about that from the time frame of when you don't have data availability, you want to start doing that even before you actually are thinking about your results coming out.

**Tegus Client**
I'd like to talk about some of the software infrastructure, CRM, HCP data, script data who you deal with, who would you recommend going with? I know the market has changed quite a bit with new entrants. And then a lot of people told us that the pricing is exorbitant, but that seems to be changing a little bit, too. So maybe some comment on where people stack up in terms of price, what you would think should be good expectation on spend?

**Former Senior Director, Medical Affairs at Apellis Pharmaceuticals**
Yes. So I've become a sucker for Veeva and just everything Veeva because it's really a one-stop shop when it comes to CRM. And the bigger thing, I think you mentioned this HCP information. So in medical, we're thinking about what is the KOL engagement plan and then thinking about KOL mapping, Veeva has that infrastructure to be able to start highlighting or doing the KOL mapping and then building that out to the actual CRM and HCP engagement and being able to have the right firewalls, but being able to collaborate with commercial.

So I think that I've used in a past few places and it's been successful. However, I will say that depending on the company and size and needs, that's something I get -- I think I get a LinkedIn invite every day, two or three every day from somebody that has some KOL mapping or HCP engagement tools.

So I think it comes down to what makes sense for the organization. I will say that our build-out for Veeva with a medical CRM and commercial CRM, I think we budgeted around $300,000 for this year to start to build out, I thinks [Technical Difficulty] (00:07:05) and that includes KOL mapping, that includes starting to set up the medical CRM component only.

Scripps, I -- to be fair, I don't really have a lot to do with the scripts. I know that we have vendors that we've used based your typical, I think, vendors, I know that we used Trinity to help us pull some stuff through as a vendor. I will think of the name of the actual data set as we're talking to, just to pop in my head.

**Tegus Client**
Got it. Super helpful. You mentioned that the two to three years beforehand, is some of that, thinking about kind of payer strategy and PBM strategy or -- is that not really part of your thinking when you're making that.

**Former Senior Director, Medical Affairs at Apellis Pharmaceuticals**
Yes. So for -- no, it is part of our thinking, but I would say that, that's something that we plan closer to data readout for payers. So I do have a GOR team member right now as the consultant versus a full-time employee.

As a smaller company, it's a little bit -- again, we are thinking about where to allocate resources. To me, it's -- let's think about getting people in the field, building out relationships, making sure that we have that presence within the community. Payers, yes, it's absolutely important to have a strategy when thinking about more about the EU, like what's the data that we're going to need for Germany? What's the data we're going to need for Spain.

But if it's for the U.S., it's really depending on the disease state and the budget impact, will this be something -- will this be a drug that actually will reduce cost for the overall payer. That's great. But most of the time, it's really building out the unmet need story. Why should people care? How does this actually benefit patients. So the payer understands the need where the drugs will actually play a role there.

We won't start talking to payers probably until after we get our first initial readout and then we'll start focusing on those key accounts. Thinking about the 50 or 60 people that we would need to talk to, that happened shortly after data readout and then kind of going into launch for those initial introductions and not met need discussions and data readout discussions.

**Tegus Client**
Got it. Super helpful. I'd love to hear about how you think about team sizing, how do you size your team? Was it built to the number of prescribers relative to the number of KOLs. And then to the extent you're close to the sales kind of rep team as well.

I'm curious how you think about the sizing there and then let's go into how reps plus MSLs engage together the kind of yes, I guess the funnel, if you will, from reps into MSLs and how much of MSL time is really just self-directed versus as a resource that the reps get to use and what you think would be a structure?

**Former Senior Director, Medical Affairs at Apellis Pharmaceuticals**
So starting from the build, I think there's a lot of different variables to consider. So it depends on the disease that the company is going into, if there's already centers of excellence set up, you're not talking about needing to visit ones in community neurologists, for example, or community hematology oncologist and you're set up for success of, okay, there's 200 centers scattered around the country.

If we imagine that an MSL will need to see someone on a quarterly basis or on a monthly basis, you can kind of set up the structure there. So previous experience in the hematology space, for example, we had about, I think, 200 centers that we had focused on for the MSL team and said, these are established centers where they know their disease extremely well.

Patient numbers are low. So we're going to have six MSLs that we'll be able to focus on those academic institutions. When it came to the actual sales team and commercial teams overall, I think those numbers are obviously much larger.

And the sales team, I think, for every MSL, I think it was 3:one, 4:one depending on the area and the density of treatment centers because they were going around and talking to individual hematologist where the MSL wouldn't. The question about resourcing, I think that's huge as an MSL itself, I have eight different sales reps that I worked with. And in each one of their territories, we would meet on I believe it was a quarterly basis to go over kind of those key accounts.

We would make sure that people are aware of what the medical activities and strategy was for those certain key accounts. And if there were other accounts that weren't part of the MSL territory, but there was a need for education or collaboration or some type of engagement with the MSL, that's something that the MSL should be able to take on.

So I would say they are -- they should be considered autonomous when I interviewed for MSL. So, it's like you are the CEO of your territory. But part of being the CEO is making sure there's success with in your territory and that includes working and making sure that the sales colleagues know what's going on and the activities are happening and making sure the need there is actually being met.

**Tegus Client**
Got it. How do you think about in-person versus remote, lots to talk about friends and acts that being includes buy lunches, do samples and lots of shift to remote, I think COVID only accelerated that, lots of acts including stuff like NC policies as far as we've been able to find out.

But it also feels like there's kind of a disconnect between the world that pharma grew up and in the world of pharma lives in today where they still have reps from the past world. They still think about field sales as a primary driver rather than being primarily a remote driven sales function. Are we on the path towards remote, where do you balance remote and field sales? And what do you think the future holds?

**Former Senior Director, Medical Affairs at Apellis Pharmaceuticals**
Uh, what a question? I feel like I'm asked this every time I do want to these and I so my perspective, while things are remote, there's still going to be a need for in-person activities and might not be going to the offices, buying breakfast, lunch and dinners, based on sales teams, I would say that the MSL team is definitely more front and center with making sure they're having meaningful impactful interactions, one, getting into the door and then, two, getting their ability to get back into the door, and that's either live or that is virtual.

And those aren't just to have conversations, to is making sure that we understand who, one, champions are, two, who are the people that we can work with to make sure that activities that the company needs to have done, like educational activities, et cetera, are being completed, that's not necessarily sales, but I think plays a strong role in building out the company is a leader within the community itself, and I think goes a long way.

To translate that to sales, I think, is difficult because the technical role of the MSL isn't necessarily to sell drugs. But I think the reality is to become a trusted partner within the community.

That's something that the community really acknowledges and I think when you have that engagement, irrespective of virtual or live, that's something that I think there's citations out there where the prescriber is 1.5x more likely to prescribe a drug based on the relationships that are built prelaunch and I think that's something that is absolutely true.

And again, can't necessarily be measured by what the medical team is doing because we're not tied to it, but it's just a matter of fact is they're thinking about that organization and the commitment they have to the community, and that just translates that ultimately into successful launches, commercialization.

That is a really long way of saying, I didn't -- I honestly, I'm not sure where the community is going to go, I know, for example, in geographic atrophy in-person visits are more common than they have been ever since the pandemic restrictions have lifted whereas diseases like ALS and spinal muscle atrophy, those are things where there's obvious reasons why you would want to have more virtual presence with diseases and people having impaired immune systems.

So I think it really is disease specific understanding what the community's risk tolerance is for those particular collaborations with the community and knowing that they now have a reason to not be with sales reps, which -- this was the reason that they got. And I think, again, puts the forefront of the meaningfulness of the conversations with the MSLs.

**Tegus Client**
Got it. I'd love to bit understand what the role of the MSL is today. Maybe naively, it feels like if content -- if this kind of common questions that you could write a medical letter and then have that information be sourceable, reviewable, sharable by the rep.

I know people often say, well, you can speak to off-label clinical data, things like that, so tell me how often that actually happens, how often KOL or someone would be asking me about, what about the Phase I that got released before -- that wasn't included in the label or post-market data.

It's not clear how kind of the interpretation that the MSL can give rather than what the community comes to its conclusion of that data really is important. So help me clarify kind of the role, the usefulness of MSL today, given how much the interpretation happens in the community versus -- yes.

**Former Senior Director, Medical Affairs at Apellis Pharmaceuticals**
Sure. So I think historically, the -- if you're at a big company, so I was at a very large Merck company when I was an MSL, and our compliance legal team came in and said, there is no difference between an MSL and a sales rep.

The only difference is that an individual can go in and they can sell a drug and -- but they cannot answer a question if a physician asks the question if they're intended to promote. So it's based all around promotion or unsolicited responses or sorry, reactive responses to unsolicited questions.

So that is the kind of the key like historical difference between an what people thought of as an MSL and a sales rep. The role of the MSL especially pre-commercialization is so much more than that, to me it is somebody that is actually starting to build the relationships within the community. So introducing the company.

So I work at a small company now that no one's ever heard of. And it's our job to make sure that people understand our commitment to their community. And then it is to talk about the disease itself that we're interested in and getting insights from the community and being able to take those insights.

So those really like golden nuggets from the HCP community, patient community and saying, this is what we're hearing on the ground. This is how we need to change our strategy. So the MSLs are not only having those building up those relationships, having the scientific discussions with the physicians, but they're and their support staff, et cetera, but they're also bringing that information back.

So the company is going to say, okay, this is our strategy for this, that and the other particular area that we're interested in within this disease state or we need to have a study or we need to communicate this differently or we need to have a publication.

That brings to next point -- there's multiple different ways to reach the community. I think you said how they get their information. They can get their information from a website a medical information website where they could ask a question and medical information writes back to them. They can get their information from the publications because that's peer-reviewed.

They can also get their information from the MSL and that's really where they're going and they're working with the MSL to really understand the context of drug X and disease Y. And so tell me about this. I know that your clinical study has this, your USPI has this, what information is there here? And then it's the MSL's job to get that question back to the company and make sure they can answer it in a precise way.

It has become the standard that the clinicians asking or the physical therapists, occupational therapists, nurse, they're asking the MSL because that's where the community has gone to say this needs to be done by someone that is fair and balanced, has the education.

But there's no reason just to go back to what I was saying originally, there is no reason why a salesperson can't do that. They just can't promote on the particular drug that they're trying to sell. So if they go into an office and a doc says tell me about pregnancy with your drug. They can no longer -- for most companies, how they think about that compliance wise, they can no longer say you should buy our drug because now they're going back and they're trying to answer a question about pregnancy risks or outcomes with that particular drug.

**Tegus Client**
Super helpful. Tell me about the MSL ideal role background. Historically, this used to be a doctor and kind of just sort of image in my head about MSL is, it used to look like, I imagine that role is changing. What do you look for in building an MSL team? And is that doctor, MD titles still necessary? Or is that changing, too?

**Former Senior Director, Medical Affairs at Apellis Pharmaceuticals**
It all yes. So when MSL role was first created, it was -- I think I've met people they had their MS degree. They were scientists, geeks that were in the industry. Now it has turned into traditional must have a PhD, MD, Pharm-D.

Now so I'm in the neurology space. I actually want people that understand that space. So physical therapists, for example, that are involved in neuromuscular diseases. I want to try to make sure that when I'm building out my team that I have the people to actually kind of have a full complement.

So we look for PhDs that understand the science of the disease. If there's an MD that kind of has an knack for a MSL experience that's somebody that we can bring in that have a treatment experience. If these other HCPs like a physical therapist, they can bring in, this is what the actual paradigm of the disease state is and how we address it.

There -- it's really supposed to support what I try to build out is a good support network. So if someone has a meeting or is planning on meeting with a certain type of physician or physical therapist or occupational therapist or nurses, if we have a good complement of those expertises, we have the best chance to make sure that we're impacting with those particular stakeholders.

So again, I think it really depends a lot of this depends on the needs of the organization. If it's a rare disease that's super complicated, you probably want somebody to be able to explain it in a very precise way.

So you'd say PhD, MD, Pharm-Ds, if you want kind of -- this is how care is moving, and we know that the disease has a great amount of information in multiple diseases. That's where you can start pulling in some of those other subgroups. Advanced practitioners, example, another example, so PAs, RNs, those are folks that are -- NPEs, those are folks that I've seen in organizations as well that worked up quite well there.

**Tegus Client**
And then what is the typical.

**Former Senior Director, Medical Affairs at Apellis Pharmaceuticals**
Yes, sorry, it's really about the DNA of the person versus their background per se, so they understand the science, but then can take their expertise and really again having that impactful meaning relationship with the clinician or HCP, that's really what you should be looking for.

**Tegus Client**
Got it. Tell me more about competition for an MSL, what do you typically comp a MSL? And then we've heard a lot about how comp can be variable. It can be tied to script volume, but some people get creative in how they do that. I would imagine year-end bonus tied to company performance would not be too disaligned from script volume anyway, but -- yes, just quickly there, what does MSL typically make and.

**Former Senior Director, Medical Affairs at Apellis Pharmaceuticals**
Yes. It's so I'm saying now what so I think when I joined as a MSL, it's like $165,000 and now I'm signing offers for like $275,000 for individuals that I have like three, four years of experience in medical. It's pretty high for the senior MSL role, I would say, would be in like a $225,000 range.

When it comes to compensation, you're right, it is tied to goal. I make sure that each one of my functions within medical affairs has their own particular goal. So for medical, for example, my or sorry, field medical, I said, okay, we know investigators within the study, now our role is to expand our external universe, and that includes a total of X amount of centers. We need to see these people by here and their ultimate end of year kind of success and what they'll be scored on is going to be the outreach that they've had an impact with those.

So if they go out and they say, okay, I've reached out to 15 centers and 10 have responded and they didn't do anything about it. They're probably -- that's not great, but if they've reached out to 15 centers, 10 responding, they're willing to lead five, five said, you know, we don't have SMA as or ALS as a disease state that we see, then that's something that I think is fine. We get 100% from reaching out.

And then it's depending on what those goals are for -- you're going to reach out to them quarterly and try to set up meetings with leadership, that's all tied to their end of year performance.

So it's not scripts. One, we don't have scripts yet, we're prelaunch here. So when we get to launch, it's totally based on what's the milestone in having those particular activities on one on ones. But as you get closer to launch, there's other activities. So you need to start doing disease pitch, symposiums and we call them academy program, educational programs with physicians, those will all be tied to must do like three educational programs over the course of the year and need [Technical Difficulty] (00:26:23) according to how those go.

**Tegus Client**
We're interested in going into some of those -- the symposium and academy content in a second here, but talk to me first about global. How do you think about building a team for Global? How do you global coverage, how do you engage with centers in Europe and Asia Pacific. Did you have a partner or did you pull that yourself and has anything with the team?

**Former Senior Director, Medical Affairs at Apellis Pharmaceuticals**
Yes, I've done both, built out and have a partner. And I think from my perspective, and we're doing this again, we're trying to decide how we're doing us. You need -- that is something you need early too. So you need a European strategy, what is our commercialization strategy? That needs to be hammered home by the executive team, executive committee, whatever they're called.

That needs to be done kind of -- again, let's say that our data readout is the beginning of next year, for example, we would have already needed to make that decision last year of, this is when we need to or where we're planning on going, this is our strategy. Are we doing EU5? Are we doing EU5 plus, meaning Germany, the DACH region and is also -- it's included Germany plus Switzerland, plus Austria.

All those decisions need to be made at the higher level and then building it out needs to be something that is manageable, especially if you're in the U.S., you don't want to just hire a huge MSL team and say everybody go crazy, you're going to lose the centralization there.

So you either can do two different approaches. You have an international kind of office that you'd set up and say, okay, you're going to have a Head of International Medical, Head of International, this, that and the other thing and they're going to report it to global headquarters or you have been at the stand-alone and they start building out their own organizations. I've done both.

I will say that having kind of that reporting into global makes a little bit easier from just an awareness perspective. And then you're saying, okay, what are the regions if it's EU plus five, for example, we're going to hire one MSL in Italy, one MSL in Germany, one MSL in Spain.

Around data readout because you're probably going to submit your EMA application after your FDA application. So let's start setting the framework and introducing ourselves as a company to these KOLs, if they're not part of your study, and you slowly start building that out.

But I think that is a slower build that I would see and you don't necessarily -- you can't really afford to just say, okay, I need 10 MSLs in Germany, for example, because that just, it takes time to, you want to make sure you have kind of the successful build out there and European rules are much different when it comes to employment that you need to consider.

**Tegus Client**
Tell me more about the symposium and the academic side, what does it look like -- yes.

**Former Senior Director, Medical Affairs at Apellis Pharmaceuticals**
Yes. Absolutely. So I think there's multiple ways to do kind of -- and there are speaker programs, just to be you've probably heard those from commercial organizations and medical, we call them scientific exchange programs, we call them academy programs, and policy like MSL symposia, journal clubs, there's all different types of names, right and wrong or no right or wrong. I think what the goal of the medical ones are, are really to get the scientific content and dialogue around disease to be more front and center.

So taking a step back, I think like commercial is really restricted in what they can talk about based on kind of what company is better on for compliance. They're stuck to the USPI for example. That to me is like a bull's eye and the medical team should be the rest of the dart board. And as long as we're able to make sure that we're able to contextualize what's in the bull's eye, that should be fair game from a disease standpoint.

So if you're doing a program and talking about the disease, the need for treatment, then the treatment availability and you're being fair and balanced, you can do all of that stuff depending on how do set up your particular program.

You can have one physician do it and talk to a group of people in their particular area where they have influence. You can bring in visiting physicians or visiting experts to bring another flavor of kind of expertise to a particular area. There's -- again, there's multiple companies out there that help out with this type of things and have done different programs where there's no paucity of available ways of doing things.

**Tegus Client**
Perfect. Thank you for your time. This was very helpful.
