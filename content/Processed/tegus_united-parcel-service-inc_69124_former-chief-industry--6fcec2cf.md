**Tegus Client**
Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today. The point of our call today is we're looking at kind of the broad cold chain and cold chain pharmaceutical but just all cold chain monitoring across the logistics platforms. So I know you work at project44 today, and you are kind of one of the big software players in the industry. But to get started, would love to hear just kind of a quick background that you have on yourself and what you're doing today at project44.

**Former Chief Industry Officer at Project44**
I'll give you a quick update because it updated, and I think you should have that updated information. I've been in supply chain for over 30 years, started in Europe in logistics, and ran Logistics operations myself. And then I started my career more on the logistics side, on the 3PL non-asset-based and asset-based side with Penske Logistics, ran long-haul, short-haul operations for them as well as warehouse operations. Then went on to the technology side for a couple of technology companies early in the 2000s.

Then I moved again and went to the shipper side, the manufacturer side of logistics with PepsiCo. I spent 10 years there in their Plano logistics and IT headquarters. And while I was there, I was a Gartner and AMRC holder. And I got contacted by Gartner who at the time was looking for someone to lead their logistics technology research for the Gartner supply chain.

I went to Gartner, and I stayed there for eight years as Vice President of Research, looking at all these different areas and technologies within logistics. And I was also the Chair of the supply chain, the symposium that Gartner would do every year in Europe and in the U.S. And then early last year, moved over to project44 as Chief Industry Officer really helping on the sales side but also the thought leadership, strategic side of the business.

And then actually, in August of last month, I changed my role to Strategic Adviser. And I've become an adviser, project44 remains my biggest account and biggest customer, but I'm also advising some other companies on the logistics technology side.

Some of the companies that work for, a company called Mojix that is kind of the other side, where project44 really focuses on visibility of what we call inventory in motion, which is more when it goes into the transportation side of it, where Mojix really focuses on inventory at rest.

So it's different technologies used, mainly RFID, to look at real-time inventory at the warehouse or the store level. And to get a full end-to-end view within supply chain visibility, you really need both sides. So these are areas where companies like a project44 and a Mojix would partner.

I also work with a company headquartered in the Dallas area called Optym. Optym is a leading asset-based trucking company optimization provider. So they work with large, mainly LTL, carrier-based companies like Estes and SAIA. They worked with Yellow until they went bankrupt and many others.

I also work with a company called Shipium. Shipium is a software provider in the last-mile space mainly focused on the optimization of parcel. Obviously, broadly used in retail. So very complementary to what they're doing on the warehouse space with some of those vendors, but then really trying to optimize that.

And then I'm currently closing out a couple of deals. One is just closed with EAIGLE that does visibility in yard automation mainly plugging into existing cameras and yards to look at what's going on in the yard and kind of automate that as well.

And then I'm also working with a company called Intelligent Audit on the freight payment side. And really, my goal is to kind of have a customer who I think is kind of the leading vendor in each space of kind of that transportation end-to-end from procurement all the way to payment because I see that there's a lot of synergies between the companies as well.

And then besides kind of just advising, I also do a lot of thought leadership. I'm setting up my own website called Better Supply Chains to continue being kind of the industry expert out there and providing, I would say, objective industry advice for people to help them to create better supply chains. And it really helps that I can kind of be connected to a lot of different companies that kind of spread that whole transportation life cycle.

**Tegus Client**
Well, it sounds like you kind of cover all parts of this space. So excited for this conversation. Maybe the way to start is just kind of talk broad industry. When we think about the cold chain kind of shipping space, we're trying to get our hands around just how big the space is.

So when you think about it from a TAM perspective, maybe number of shipments per year or however you think about it, when you go to one of these companies like a project44, how do you think about just the overall addressable market?

**Former Chief Industry Officer at Project44**
Yes. I will say, so project44, although they do visibility, most of what they're doing is tracking, I would say, more ambient product or not necessarily focused on pharmaceutical, although they will have customers that

aren't even in pharmaceutical that use them.

But when we really talk about cold chain, that's where you're starting to require kind of more of that hardware where you're starting to see other companies that, in many cases, are partners to a project44 and others. I would say the Controlants and the Tives and the Roambees of the world are more those companies that provide the hardware that allow you to track not just location, which is what project44 mainly does is look at the location.

But when you need to go at a very, very accurate level to look at temperature measurement or even condition or humidity or shock and these types of things, you really need hardware. And that's something that project44 doesn't do. So they don't have their own hardware. They don't develop hardware.

But what they do is they partner with companies like Tive, Roambee or Controlant and others so that when a customer has a part of their supply chain that does need cold chain, all that tracking at a shipment level or unit level to be able to pull all that information in and then combine that with all the other information to still have a single view to all their end-to-end supply chain visibility.

So if you look at the market, it is a very large market because obviously transportation, as you know, is a multibillion-dollar business around the world with many, many millions of shipments happening. And of course, with companies like project44 now covering all modes of transportation, you're not just talking about millions of containers. You're obviously talking about tens of millions of truck shipments in the U.S. alone on a yearly basis. You're talking about hundreds of millions of parcel movements happening.

So that market is just huge and continuously growing as there's more and more demand. And obviously, that creates a much larger market where, I would say, today out of that whole total addressable market, only a small percentage of that, I would say, is currently filled today. But it's growing, I would say, a little bit at a slower rate than what it was before, but it's still growing at a fast rate.

Now I will say cold chain is a much smaller part of that. Although, obviously, if you looked at when COVID happened, all these millions of shipments of all the COVID vaccines that were happening, there was a very quick acceleration, especially in pharmaceuticals.

And then on top of that, with kind of the newer Drug Supply Chain Security Act, that I believe has its next milestone in November of this year, where you must be able to provide end-to-end visibility of drugs and pharmaceuticals kind of within that cold chain supply chain, we see that there also has been more and more adoption of that technology by the large pharmaceutical providers.

But if you look at it in terms of percentage of what pharmaceutical uses compared to, for example, what the CPG industry does, it's obviously a lot smaller percentage of the market. And some of the other industries like CPG or retail and especially also 3PL, I would say, are probably still by far the largest numbers and if you look at it from a shipment number compared to all the industries.

And that's also why you see that although a Tive is a very good company to just name them as an example or Roambee, the amount of revenue and shipments that they cover is much smaller than, for example, project44 or FourKites. And even then, their revenue is quite different because a big part of revenue is hardware-related, whereas pretty much 100% of the project44 or FourKites revenue is transaction-based or just pure SaaS revenue that they're creating.

So it's a little bit of a different market, but then there's a lot of partnerships between the two because these companies, even if you're, let's say, not in pharmaceuticals or you're in food or beverage cold chain, in many cases, you have ambient food, you have refrigerated food. You don't necessarily have always 100% of just cold chain. So now you need to be able to combine those two technologies, but companies still want to have that visibility on a single footprint.

All three of them, like others like Savis, et cetera, and I usually create this additional document together with the Magic Wand, which was Magic Wand and contextualization node specific on tracking and monitoring because tracking and monitoring is quite different of a market than the overall real-time visibility market, where real-time visibility we defined as having a network of connections to carriers to provide visibility.

Here, they don't have networks of carriers. They have connectivity through their own hardware. That's how they pull in the information which if you're doing, for example, just regular ambient movements and you're having about 3.7 million trucks in the U.S., you're not going to have every one of those trucks that's going to buy additional equipment or hardware to track it.

You must be able to plug into the existing hardware, which in the U.S. would be an ELD device or a telematics advice that most long-haul, over-the-road trucks have installed. They must have that because it's a mandate by the Department of Transportation, and then you're able to pull the information on locations from that.

**Tegus Client**
So is that what project44 is doing? They're basically grabbing the data off the telematics devices on all the trucks.

**Former Chief Industry Officer at Project44**
Correct. For the over-the-road full truckload side, that's mainly how they do it. There's multiple ways, but that's the preferred way because it's the most accurate, finite, real-time piece of information. And you're doing that by creating partnerships with all the telematics companies.

So they have partnerships with around 1,100 telematics vendors. So that when a new trucking company comes around and you say you want to connect, they just have to say, what's your telematics provider that you use? And then on the back end, that connection to that telematics provider is already connected. And then we can just pull from the back end of the telematics provider, we can pull all that information for that shipper with that carrier.

**Tegus Client**
Right. And then what about other modes of transportation, air, rail, sea?

**Former Chief Industry Officer at Project44**
Yes, yes. It's very different mode by mode. With rail, a lot of times, it's with a partner. So rail is where you have fairly established vendors already in the market like a Rail Link and others. So a lot of the times, companies just pull it from that partner, but then what they will do is they will combine it with other data to augment and enrich the data.

But I would say for rail and for air, most of the time because it's a limited number of key players in the market, logistics providers don't have millions. You're talking about dozens or hundreds potentially. You're pulling that from a partner.

And then for ocean, you're pulling that information typically directly from the ocean carriers. And again, I think project44 probably have somewhere around 98% of old ocean carriers connected. And there's only about 120 on the container side. And even then, less than 10 of the world's largest containership companies move about 80% of all the volume. So it's quite different in what you need to do to get the data.

And then obviously, also the type of data is different by mode. Because, I would say, although the complexity in over-the-road transportation, it's more complex from the sense that there's so many trucking companies that you need to connect to, but it's just typically a simple movement from A to B over the road.

Whereas when you talk about international movements, there could be a truck leg, a rail leg, then it goes into the port. A lot of stuff happens in the port. Sometimes the container sits there for days. Then it goes on to the ship. That could be several weeks potentially with transshipment. Then it arrives at a port. Now it sits there for another few days, and then it has another leg as well.

So when you go to that level, the complexity doesn't go to how many providers you have, but then it goes into the complexity. There are so many different milestones and so many often kind of black-hole data in between because when it sits somewhere on the dock side at a port, unless you have some kind of device on the container where you can pull live information from which you typically don't have, you don't really know what's happening there.

So there, you must have things like terminal visibility and other additional data points or in some cases, you must create those data points based on your intelligence to really have that full end-to-end view of that container movement from origin all the way to destination.

**Tegus Client**
So project44 is grabbing all the data from all the telematics and getting it from other partners for rail, air, sea. I assume you're doing a bunch of analytics on that to give the end user some level of value-add on top of just aggregating the data.

**Former Chief Industry Officer at Project44**
Correct.

**Tegus Client**
I mean, are there any limitations contractually to what you are allowed to do analytically with the data? I mean it seems like this would be an opportunity for some complex machine learning, data science-type work to try to better understand supply chains and better predict outcomes.

**Former Chief Industry Officer at Project44**
Correct. And that's exactly what happens to it. I would say that the biggest, I would say, contractual limitation there is on the shipper side as well as on the carrier side is that once you start doing kind of more of the whole network effect, where you're starting to look at information in general, is that it must be anonymized.

So anything except what you provide to the shipper about their own shipments or what you provide to a carrier and their own fleet and the shipments that they're moving, when you pull all that information across the industry that then you apply to all the data, that big thing is it must be anonymized. So the data must be secure and it must be anonymized.

So no one could say, oh, based on the information you give me, I can deduce that there's other people moving A to B or if I compare what my on-time deliveries versus the industry average, I can deduce that my competitor does better or worse. So that's a big restriction.

And so I would say both carriers and shippers looking at this platform from the perspective of, one, if your people mine data, how secure is that data. And as you know, security is a big concern for all companies because of all the hacking that's going on.

And you mentioned AI, well AI, it can do good for mankind, but there's just as many hackers. And people that have bad intentions use the same technology to try and get access to all your data or to your systems to hijack it that may make you pay to regain access to your own systems.

The second part is the data quality. So I would say that's a big differentiation. It's not because you can get data from multiple points or in some cases, aggregate data in different ways. That is all the same data.

I would say project44 is the most advanced in the sense of working with, for example, large ocean carriers where they moved away from data scraping that some others did in the past or even EDI connections to move them on to API connections to get a lot better and much faster updated information through those API connections. And that obviously helps with improving the data quality.

And then it's the intelligence from AI behind it that says, hey, if I get a data point in, how can I make sure that I can understand if that data is correct because it's crapping, it crapped out. So I need to understand when I get a data point that it's correct if someone's giving me that data or if I see that something is missing that I can augment the data.

So if I get, for example, I get for a customer 10 shipments from UPS going to a location. Well, I know because maybe in the Metroplex, I'm making one million deliveries that day. Now I can use all that other data to get a much higher level of accuracy on that single data point because I'm now applying all the data against it and

the intelligence refining the ETA that you're using. So a lot of that intelligence really goes into the accuracy of ETA.

And if you, for example, see from release to release or every few months when they're fine-tuning the algorithms, you're seeing that as we're getting more data in these systems and as we also are learning to apply AI better and machines are faster, et cetera, you're starting to see you're continuously improving the accuracy of that ETA.

So in no way is this really something that, hey, it's stable, it's no longer evolving, it's all there. This is still kind of, I would say, a start-up world where companies are augmenting their networks. They're getting more data. But as they grow, you also see the accuracy of the quality of the data continue to improve.

**Tegus Client**
You mentioned estimating the arrival time of the shipment when you pack it. Are you also doing things like helping estimate how long a package will stay cold or what packing materials need to be used to keep it cold for the duration of its shipment? Or is that more.

**Former Chief Industry Officer at Project44**
No, I would say that's not something that project44 does. And I would say that's something that typically the companies do when they look at shipping and they have their own product where they say, according to regulation, it needs to be at this temperature. So we need to make sure that we pack it in a certain way, and that's typically consistent.

I would say it's a little bit different, for example, with food products. So I'll give you an example. When I was at PepsiCo for Frito-Lay, if you had a certain ingredient and you would ship them spring and in fall when it's typically below 80 degrees, you would just ship them in a dry van regular trailer.

But let's say, suddenly, I now know that the forecast says that in three days, and even in March or in February, I'm going to hit 90 degrees, suddenly for that temperature, I need to change that to a refrigerated truck, otherwise that's going to spoil.

The same, for example, with beer, it's the opposite. Beer will spoil when it goes through a very cold area because it might freeze the beer. And by the time it gets there, in an ambient truck, it might be completed. So they might have to say, hey, let's hold on to that shipment, not ship it, because we're going to ruin it.

But typically, with pharmaceuticals, because there is so such strong regulation around it, it always must be within a certain contained environment that it's not as much, I would say, something that a transactional system like a visibility platform would control. It's more determined. And then obviously, the logistics service provider must make sure that the equipment they're moving it in holds between those parameters of temperature.

**Tegus Client**
Got it. So if you think about all cold chain shipping, how many shipments per year do you think that represents? And then within that, how many shipments are the pharmaceutical shipments?

**Former Chief Industry Officer at Project44**
I don't have a number there. I've never seen, to be honest, the market from that perspective. But if I would have to take a wild guess, I would probably say it's less than 10% of all the shipments. Now it is a market that gets more tracked because some people say, well, if it's a very low-cost product and that's not a cold chain, meaning there's a lot less potential for, one, it to be lost. So it's not high value like electronics, like TVs. And secondly, it's not very vulnerable, like certain foods or high-end pharmaceuticals or there aren't any lives that are a stake because of it.

Obviously, you're going to see with pharmaceuticals, it's high-margin business so they can spend more on it. It is vital also from the tracking now with that compliance act that's in place. We also see that we also must track and not just from a temperature perspective but also because you need to track it through your supply chain to make sure we don't have counterfeit medication that hits the patient.

So you will see that, probably in percentage-wise, a higher percentage of cold chain pharmaceutical products or shipments will be tracked by technology compared to the percentage of regular ambient products from CPG companies that are being tracked through supply chain visibility.

**Tegus Client**
Yes. Makes sense. But you don't have a sense for how many shipments today might be tracked within pharma?

**Former Chief Industry Officer at Project44**
No. But if you look at some of these vendors that are doing that and then you look at all the technology platforms that you just take like some of the companies that I mentioned that are very focused mainly the pharma industry, you still see that those companies are small of revenues.

I'm talking about most of these companies are like $15 million, $20 million, $30 million maybe in revenue. Whereas some of the larger ones that do overall supply chain visibility is kind of outside of it. Like a project44 or FourKites have already kind of gone over the $100 million ARR mark.

So we're seeing that that's a lot bigger market. But obviously, the cold chain pharmaceutical, is more of a niche market. But it is a very important market, and it's much more related to the quality also of the hardware, not just of the data.

**Tegus Client**
Got it. When someone like a project44 does partner with one of the hardware providers, what are you getting from the hardware providers? Is it just the hardware, and then all the software is handled by a project44?

**Former Chief Industry Officer at Project44**
No. So the way it works is that it's a technology partnership where the other visibility vendor would provide their services, but then through the APIs, a project44 would pull in all the data that's collected by that vendor and then pull it into the project44 platform.

So to give you one example, that could be cold chain but that can also be, for example, for a large fleet that has maybe telematics that only own 95% of the fleet. 5% of the fleet is specialized flatbed trucks that don't have to have telematics because they don't have to do that according to regulations.

Well, how do you track that? Well, they'll put Tive trackers on those flatbed trucks. And so for that 5% of that fleet, the data will come from Tive as the source of the data, pull that into API. Then you will see all the data, all the visibility coming into the project44 platform.

So project44 doesn't just buy the trackers and then it consumes directly from the tracker the data. The data will still go to like a Tive, but then it will pull through the API for that shipper for all those shipments, it will pull through APIs all that data real time into the project44 platform like it would pull it real time from the telematics backbone and then just add that data into the platform.

Obviously, if there is additional fields like temperature, humidity, barometric pressure, shock, all of that, whatever data points they provide or whatever exception data is being provided, gets sucked into the p44 platform and can be displayed through there as well.

Or vice versa, a lot of the larger customers don't really use the platform. All they use the data. So then project44 as one tool provides all the data through API again to the customer who might then look at the data through their own control power or whatever system they have in place.

**Tegus Client**
And is this a new offering for project44? Or is this something you've all been doing for a while?

**Former Chief Industry Officer at Project44**

Those partnerships have been in place for the last two to three years, correct.

**Tegus Client**
So I assume what typically happens is you have kind of long-standing relationships across the different logistics companies, and they might say they have certain shipments that need a little bit more in-depth visibility. If that's correct, what kind of the process you do you pull in a specific hardware provider? Like how do you choose between a Tive or a Roambee or whoever else you've mentioned?

**Former Chief Industry Officer at Project44**
Yes. In some cases, where maybe project44 is the leading vendor going into the account and saying, hey, we have some of these owner shipments, I would say, well, you really need hardware on that. They might say, who would you guys recommend? And we would say, well, for project44, we have these partners.

In some cases, it might be an existing customer of a Tive that says, hey, we started doing visibility with you guys for a specific area of high-value or very sensitive product doing visibility. But now we don't want to do visibility on everything. But we don't really want to use trackers on everything because we must pay for the tracker, and then you have the whole supply chain of kind of getting the trackers back and putting them on the next shipments.

So for those other movements, we just want regular real-time visibility. And then maybe it would be a Tive that through the partnership would bring in a project44 or a different partner. And so it's typically not necessarily the choice of project44 to say what vendor comes in.

In many cases, it's the customer themselves that will say, yes, we want to use project44, and we'll look at your partners, but then we decide from those partners who we want to use. And then the customer really dictates to say, hey, you guys need to make these two things work together.

And I think originally, that's how it started, the partnerships. Some of these things sounds great to be a partner, but it's really the customer that dictates to say, we don't want to be connected twice. You guys need to figure this out.

In our case, if project44 is 90% of what we use, project44, you need to be able to consume the Tive data. But maybe in some cases, Tive is 80% of all the volume. And then we send the information to Tive and Tive is now their platform through which they get all their data. So it's really the customer who has the most impact on that.

**Tegus Client**
Interesting. So either of the platforms could be the main interface for the customer and you provide the data?

**Former Chief Industry Officer at Project44**
Correct.

**Tegus Client**
Interesting. I know project44 kind of does all shipments. And when you think about all shipments, there's probably less that need to be tracked with an actual hardware device because there's probably less valuable shipments than when you think about the specific cold chain space.

But what percent do you think are currently have the just kind of real-time location versus an actual hardware device placed on and that might have another parameter that it's displaying like temperature, humidity?

**Former Chief Industry Officer at Project44**
So you're asking how many of these trackers are really installed in the marketplace? I would say globally, you're talking about hundreds of millions of shipments. Whereas if you really look at trackers, you might have maybe a couple of millions of trackers.

I would say it's a lower percentage. I don't have an exact number. I don't think that number exists. But if I would say how many are tracked compared to total shipments, I would say it's probably less than 5% that have the hardware on it.

And a lot of it is still based on the cost of the hardware or the fact that you need to get the hardware there to put it with the shipment. And then you also need to get the hardware back because part of why the hardware is getting cheaper is technology keeps advancing. But also it becomes cheaper because it can be reused smaller, reused.

We're getting to the point where now there is, and Tive has that and several other vendors have it too, where it's almost like a label, a label that has technology in it where you can track at least temperature. If you need a lot of these other conditions or a lot more accurate, we need a more expensive device.

But that's where we still see that overall, the pure data that comes from the network, that market continues to be a lot bigger. Now in the future, if let's say, you could have something that's the size of a postal stamp that is less than $1, then maybe it becomes more of a market where you put that stuff on everything. But we're not there yet.

And so most people, their use case is good enough to say, okay, if we can track the whole load by knowing where the truck is or where the power unit is and we know that trailer is connected to that power unit, that's good enough for us.

Because the biggest part is really the inventory play. It's understanding where the inventory is, where is it going to be late because it might be on the inbound side hitting my manufacturing. On the outbound side, it might hit your customer and your customer manufacturing, your customer experience. There might be loss of revenue.

And then the other part, what we're really starting to see now is that it's not just any more from the execution level tracking where that truck is, but having the data where you can start forecasting when it is that I need to order something. I know my inventory is getting low, but if I order something from China today, is it going to take six weeks to get here? eight weeks, seven weeks, what is it?

If I order it thinking it's eight weeks and it's really six weeks, I got two weeks too much of inventory. So now my inventory level is going to go up, which is what we saw last year. That's why we saw overall U.S. business logistics costs went up more than it ever has in the past. It's now up to 9.2% of total GDP. And the biggest part of the 19% increase was due to inventory carrying costs.

So I think that's another part where data, much more than just the tracking, is so valuable for companies. Because you see a lot of these very large companies, they have billions of dollars in inventory. So if you can impact that just by 1%, you're talking about tens of millions of dollars. If you can reduce their inventory by 5% or 10%, you're talking about $100 million or $200 million in savings.

And so I think that's where you're starting to see a lot of bigger usage rather than, well, one out of every 1,000 events, maybe my food, my beef will spoil, and now I'm losing $300,000 worth of product. I don't have that issue now. So you kind of must look at it from that comparison to companies saying, hey, I can save $30 million, $80 million, $150 million a year by having the data that can really help me run my supply chain better.

And when you think about the kind of cost of the different trackers, obviously, it makes sense if they were $0.01, you would track everything in real time with all the parameters you could get. But does it feel like we're at some sort of inflection point where they're starting to get cheap enough that people are really pulling them under more and more shipments? Or does it feel more like we're in a steady state where all the top shippers currently track about 5% or 10%, and we don't really see that moving unless there's a big technological change?

Yes. We've already seen a change from where 10 years ago, a tracker was $500 to $1,000. Now we see trackers that are $50. And if you buy another Tive, those smaller Tive devices, you can get them as low as like $35.

But then you still must think about, well, how do I recharge them, how do we get them back in there, et cetera. So it's not that easy, and it's not like everyone just has a huge inventory of these Tive devices sitting there. So the supply chain is a lot more complex rather than on the real-time feasibility side where you're saying, well, you already have that telematics already installed in the truck or it comes with the truck because a lot of trucks when you buy a new truck, it already has telematics installed.

Just like if you buy a new car, it has telematics in it because the manufacturer of the car uses that telematics to give them all the details, one that they can upsell you on servicing, knowing when it needs to come in for service or when a part is going to go out.

They also use it for their own engineering to know when a fault happens. They know, oh, this fault happened with the engine or with the air conditioning. And they then use that in their engineering process to make the next version of their next car better. And that's a lot easier to use the technology that already comes with a vehicle than something that you must have additionally put in.

And it also happens in some of these devices, Lehman's law. And you still see that some of the time, these things don't work because they are cheap. And then one out of every probably 20 to 30, there's a signal that maybe isn't as accurate. And suddenly now, you're not getting any information.

You asked that in the beginning with telematics too, where I would say probably when I was implementing the Qualcomm devices at PepsiCo, I would say in the beginning, one out of every 10 to 12 devices wouldn't work, and we had to replace them. So there are still some challenges with that.

It's not to the point where it's as easy as an iPhone, but then again, an iPhone is a great advice. But I just had to order a new one for the wife and you go like, wow, that thing really cost $1,300. That's the same price as their whole Apple laptop.

**Tegus Client**
All right. Do you know any other hardware providers besides Controlant or Tive that are maybe worth mentioning?

**Former Chief Industry Officer at Project44**
Yes. Like I said, Roambee is another one that plays in this space. Savi, they've been around a lot longer. So they started in '89. So they've been around now for close to 35 years where a lot of these other ones have really come up in the last few years. Now obviously, for the ones that have been around longer, they have the older hardware still installed, and they're trying to compete with all the new stuff as well.

Sendum is another one, a Canadian company, so they're another company that focus on life sciences, pharmaceuticals, et cetera. Sensitech another one, again, one of those older ones that have been in the market. So they're an American company. So there's quite a few of these companies.

And then we're starting to see that there's even smaller companies, some of these are getting acquired. I think Roambee acquired one company. I think Tive acquired two different companies: one in Australia, one in Europe to get a much bigger and more global footprint in the market.

And I think that's the other confusing part as well for customers. When you have all these different vendors, what really is the difference between them? Is the hardware really that different? How do you really look at that? So I think that's the difference.

And then like I said, especially with pharma, there's been companies who only focus really on the pharmaceutical industry. Like Controlant would be one. They only do pharmaceuticals. I think Roambee, they do pharmaceutical. They also do food and beverage, they do chemicals, they do electronics, automotive.
Tive started more on the food side. So you see them more with CPG company, but then they started going

into automotive, industrial, retail, pharmaceuticals, et cetera. So they're all very much competitive, but they all have a little bit of a different approach to it.

**Tegus Client**
I think we've definitely seen the fragmentation in the device market. Are the two big players in more of the software side, FourKites and project44? And they're kind of the behemoths and there aren't really many others to mention?

**Former Chief Industry Officer at Project44**
Yes, and it's because it's the network. I would say, the hardware is a little bit less complex in the sense that if you're someone with background, it's not necessarily that hard to come up with another device and build the latest and greatest device.

But building networks takes a ginormous amount of money and time to build the network. It's a little bit very comparable to if you look at being a full manufacturer or being the guy that provides the network. So if you're the Verizon, the AT&T, they spend even now on the new 5G network, it costs billions of dollars to put up all these new towers to have the network. And so you see that other vendors will rely on the existing network that they've built.

That's something that is very hard. Once you have a leader that has a network, it's very hard to replace and to compete with. And that's why you've seen in like terrestrial communication, you saw a market before that was very spread out, and then you saw all these acquisitions happening. And now you have maybe less than six or less main players in the market.

Visibility is a little bit the same. You saw all these vendors like four or five years ago. Some of them started going out of the market. There's still a few here and there that are new onto the market. But the demand is always from these companies to say, and we'll be doing with project44, is a customer I'm doing a webinar with them soon.

But if you ask them what sets apart one vendor from the other, they say, well, we had a need for a company that could provide us with global service, meaning in every region around the world; secondly, someone that could do all modes of transportation.

So if you have those first two requirements already, you're only talking about FourKites and project44. It's very hard for all those others to support that. When you have a device, you need to be able to ship it around the world. But because you're a device and you don't depend on the network, you could be global, which makes the market harder from a competition perspective. It also makes it easier for new competitors to come into the market.

But I would say, especially currently, people are not going to spend $500 million on a new visibility player to come in and try and replicate the network that a FourKites and a project44 have already built.

**Tegus Client**
Well, that makes a lot of sense. We appreciate the time today. Have a great rest of your day.
