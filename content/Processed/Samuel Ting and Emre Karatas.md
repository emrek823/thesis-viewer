### Samuel Ting Background

- Computer science PhD from Oxford, focused on biological causal inference algorithms
- Previously at Superpower.com (formerly Before Health) - preventative healthcare platform in Australia
- Identified gap in pharma commercial innovation while everyone focused on drug discovery AI

### Open Helix Product & Vision

- Building compliant AI for pharma medical reps to capture notes and provide recommendations
- Core problem: Med reps can’t take notes due to compliance fears
	- Handle 10+ interactions daily, keeping everything in memory
	- Companies ban pen/paper to avoid litigation evidence
	- Performance variance between top/bottom reps is 3-5x in specialties like oncology
- Solution components:
	- Policy-constrained LLM following compliance rules
	- Safe note capture (ephemeral recording, compliance summaries only)
	- Recommendation engine for what reps should say on-label
	- Training module using virtual doctors/office staff

### Market Validation & Traction

- Initial clients in India market:
	- Mankind Pharma (15,000 medical reps)
	- Lupin pilot (10,000 medical reps)
- Customer discovery interviews from Pfizer CEO level to individual med reps
- Key insight: CEO’s biggest post-approval fear is compliance violations leading to $2B litigation settlements
- Identified Veeva as main incumbent with limited recent innovation

### Fundraising Plans

- Currently raising $2-3M USD
- Timeline: Next couple weeks, before December
- In SF meeting VCs, going to New York next
- Looking specifically for healthcare-focused investors who understand the space

### Next Steps

- Samuel to send materials when refined and ready
- Virtue will discuss internally at Monday partner meeting
- Focus areas for internal review: product, user experience, go-to-market
- Emre to respond early next week with feedback and potential next call
