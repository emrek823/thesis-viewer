*(Note: The chart image provided for "Monthly Activations (Dispatch vs. Field)" shows stacked bars that don't clearly differentiate dispatch and field values for each month but rather shows total activations as in the previous chart. The values in the bars are also hard to precisely read, so I'm using an estimation based on the overall bar heights and general pattern for Dispatch vs Field.)*

*(Note: The line chart titled "Running Average Total Calls" is difficult to read precise values for "Minutes" and "Market" as the lines are very close and scale is coarse. The values are estimated based on visual inspection.)*

*(Note: The stacked bar chart "Diversions by Month (Dispatch vs. Field)" is visually very difficult to distinguish exact values for "Dispatch" and "Field" for each month as the colors are similar and the stack is ambiguous. The values are estimated based on general bar heights and relative positions.)*

### OPERATIONAL METRICS

### AVERAGE TIME TO ANSWER EMS CALLS:

*   For calls coming through EMS (RightSite application), this is calculated from the time the crew member joins RightSite until Navigator accepts the call.
*   For calls coming through Dial Pad, we have hard coded this total based on historical averages of 10 seconds and continue to monitor monthly.

**Avg Time to Answer EMS Calls:** 12 SECONDS
**GOAL <= 15 seconds**

### AVERAGE TIME TO EMS RELEASE:

*   Calculation begins with start time as the Episode Created time and duration ends when EMS is released from call.
*   Dispatch initiated calls will have a shorter EMS Release duration because a separate call back is made to close out issue in CAD.
