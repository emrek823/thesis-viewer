### Company Overview & Background

- Shreya previously built AI/ML platform at Current Health for digital biomarkers
	- CAR-T therapy focus: CRS (cytokine release syndrome) detection post CAR-T
	- Digital biomarker for CRS detection - significant pharma interest from study with Mount Sinai
	- Core features for clinicians and post-acute monitoring fundamentals
	- Worked with Tom on selling to pharma - reviewed all contracts
	- Attempted $2.5M sale before FDA pre-submission
	- FDA rejected sepsis predicate approach - required same exact disease type despite similar presentation
- Spent 6 months to 1 year understanding therapy-to-market pathway
	- Quantifying digital biomarker value when paired with therapies
	- Understanding leverage in negotiations - two main complaint areas identified
- Previous experience at Aetna (Analysis and Behavior Change office) and CareMark connections
	- Deep dive into rebate negotiation complexity through industry contacts

### Market Access Platform & Competitive Landscape

- Current focus: AI agents for market access - believes this will transform the space
- Competitive analysis identified:
	- Model N and Model N replacements (everyone complains about Model N despite $1B+ acquisition)
	- Cohere Health building better Model N version
	- Nablan at Eversana (described as “boomer tech”)
	- MMIT under Norstella Group
	- IQVIA (unlikely to compete directly, might acquire)
- Platform approach:
	- Segment-specific sub-models with modular UI
	- Currently text answers, future: 5-10 scenario modeling capability
	- CEO deck preparation with assumption testing tools

### Go-to-Market Strategy & Wedge

- Primary wedge: 505B2 companies
	- Lack market access teams, need affordable solutions
	- Can’t afford expensive traditional methods
	- Become ready for rebate bidding within year of FDA filing
	- Alternative paths: Cost Plus Drugs, full cash pay, GoodRx strategy
- Advisor network established:
	- VP Market Access at Rosemont Pharmaceuticals (UK liquid formulations company)
	- Gave playbook, targeting 505B2 companies specifically
	- LOI in process with Rosemont - “almost guaranteed” long-term engagement
- Campaign running this week to identify companies willing to work within 1-2 months
- Fundraising timeline: early October (month and half, two months out)

### Next Steps & Expansion Plans

- Scaling strategy considerations:
	- Fast scaling through data acquisition and new product layering
	- Potential partnership with CareMark (data sharing agreement)
	- CVS Health Ventures connection (invest later stage, not early checks)
- International expansion opportunity:
	- Japanese companies often license out US products due to market access complexity
	- Democratizing/simplifying process could unlock huge market
- Expansion paths beyond market access:
	- GPO optimization for oncology/hospital therapies
	- Med device market (significant contract-based money loss)
	- AI model sales to big pharma (similar to digital biomarker approach)
- Immediate needs:
	- Hiring “cracked” full-time engineer
	- Co-development partnerships with larger companies (had early Organon conversation)
	- Seeking better-known company partnerships (Novartis, Sumitomo previously ghosted)
