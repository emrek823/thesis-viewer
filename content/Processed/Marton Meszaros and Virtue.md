### Marton’s Background & Experience

- Grew up in Hungary, moved to London
- Previous role: First employee at an Alzheimer’s diagnostic company
	- Developed speech and language-based assessments for neurological diseases
	- Technology needed better data to work effectively
	- Ran observational clinical studies tracking early-stage Alzheimer’s patients
	- Successfully partnered with pharma after improving technology
- Key learnings:
	- Good datasets make downstream problems “disappear”
	- Biomedical space is broken in creating/reusing human biodata
	- CROs were expensive and couldn’t handle specialized requirements
	- Successfully ran Phase II-sized studies on hard-to-find patients in under a year

### Ossian Bio: Company Overview

- Incorporated formally in November 2024
- Mission: Build the most valuable biobanks in the world
	- Create a “1000x better” version of UK Biobank
	- Focus on aging and age-related diseases (e.g., COPD)
	- Aim to be primary owner/creator of valuable human datasets
- Team composition:
	- Marton: Clinical operations background
	- 2 researchers from Oxford lab specializing in statistical methods
	- 2 senior people who ran genomic target assessment teams at pharma companies (Merck, GSK)
- Business approach:
	- Start with small but highly valuable datasets
	- Focus on resilient biology where small patient numbers can provide insights
	- Unlike Regeneron’s approach (3M patient sequences), identify valuable patients before sequencing
	- Combine clinical operations with analytical capabilities to identify high-value patients

### Data Collection Strategy

- Two parallel approaches:
	- Partner with existing biobanks
		- Target time-series samples from Northern Europe and Australia
		- Identify 50-200 most interesting patients from 50k patient pools
		- Request access to these specific patients
	- Run observational clinical studies
		- Engage with sites in UK and US
		- First patient expected in January
		- Complete dataset by mid-next year
- Timeline seems aggressive but Marton has experience delivering similar timelines
- Focus on finding phenotypically normal but genetically resilient patients

### Fundraising & Next Steps

- Raising approximately $2-2.5M
	- Has term sheet but prefers SAFE structure
	- Post-money valuation of $10M
	- Lead investor committing $1M
- Funds will be used to:
	- Build computational capabilities for identifying resilient patients
	- Create first internal dataset (low hundreds of patients)
	- Analyze datasets to validate targets
- Business development:
	- Planning partnerships with 3-5 biotech companies
	- Offering indication-specific resilient patient identification (e.g., NASH, heart failure)
- Next steps:
	- Marton will share additional materials/data room access
	- Available for follow-up calls and questions
	- Virtue considering ~$1M+ investment
	- Decision timeline: end of next week
