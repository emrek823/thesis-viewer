Transcript

Sean Doolan
So very, you know, very straightforward. What we do is we fully, we exclusively focus on first check. So really pre seed and seed stage, investing broadly across the healthcare sector. And so we are still investing out of our fund one, just over 30 million bucks. We'll invest, you know, half a million up to, you know, 2 million bucks upon entry. And, you know, 20 companies in this portfolio so far. And we'll be announcing our second fund, just over 55 million next month and going live on that in Q1. So excited.

iPhone (226)
Congratulations to you guys. That's awesome.

Sean Doolan
Yeah, yeah, I really do appreciate it. And you know, more recently we've been, you know, spending some time in your world and I would say in general we like to sort of find these intersectional opportunities to invest in sort of the healthcare plus, fintech, healthcare plus, you know, insure tech and, you know, really been going a bit deeper in these sort of logistics and supply chain world specifically and as that relates to, you know, cold chain technologies and pharma. And so been talking with, you know, various folks more recently to bring us up to speed. And Bob being one of those Guys and some of the other team members at Uber Freight and him and Clay had mentioned you and given your background, thought could be a really quality conversation. So we're getting up to speed.

Sean Doolan
We actually are doing diligence specifically right now on a company in that cold chain space that we are quite excited about. But that is sort of context on our side.

iPhone (226)
Yeah, I mean great. It's happy to, you know, talk about the space and share everything about, you know, my experiences of what I may or may not know. And again, I have a lot of experience and a lot of experience doing the wrong things by the way too, which is kind of what gives us even more helpful. Yeah, the quite relevant experience. But yeah, any. First of all, congratulations. It's you know, obviously starting your second fund now or finishing your second fund in terms of filling and then being able to. I think you said 20 plus investments you made and are probably going to make some more. I think that's great. And obviously looking for the intersection between your sweet spot and adjacent industries and where those two things can collide and two equals 10.

iPhone (226)
And that's the name of the game, as you know better than I do.

Sean Doolan
Absolutely, absolutely. Well, if you don't mind, actually. So we definitely have a couple more specific questions, but I think it would be helpful to start off. We'd love to better understand origin story behind Project44, how that got started and you know, because we have spoken with some project P44 has come up quite a bit, you know, more recently. It's a company we are familiar with but you know, we'd love to maybe get some context on the origin story, how P44 came about and then we kind of get a little bit more dialed in thereafter.

iPhone (226)
Yeah. So you know, Jet McCandless, Jet, who's still the CEO of Project 44. The initial idea around visibility and you know, automating a shipment life cycle using things like, you know, at the time, API versus EDI and kind of creating a. Not kind of really creating a one to many network globally was Jet's idea. And that idea was incubated, you know, 2017, maybe late 16. And as a board member of the holding company Blue Water, which is our whole Co of Project 44th Time and other companies. I hated the idea by the way. I thought it was terrible. Well, today. Why? Because what we found out was the Persona were selling to was me. Because I thought that I was smarter, knew more came from the industry, had it all figured out for the next 50 years.

iPhone (226)
And why would you change what I'm doing because I'm doing all the right things.

Sean Doolan
Exactly.

iPhone (226)
Which is obviously completely false. But it's, it was, you know, it was interesting because I came off the board to run it in whatever December of 20 I think it was, or December of 6 or 15 I should say is the moment that happened. It was interesting because we started from a product standpoint kind of mapping Personas to me, which is, that's who were selling to. And you had to get through a pretty rigorous cycle of change management and you know, really telling the value story much more succinctly than we knew how to do initially. So. But really the idea of A1 to many, you know, a connection across all modes, regions, you know, geographies, a dream jet had from the very first day.

iPhone (226)
And you know, I, I look now and obviously very proud of jet and entire team and yeah, it's been a fun ride.

Emre Karatas
That's, that's great. And maybe with that initial launch for P44, you're touching on that full end to end visibility. How do you guys think about getting that off the ground? Because you're starting with a certain percentage of shipments, a certain percentage of modes of transportation. And so when you get to that scale, I think we can all understand the value of that visibility. But on the way there, how do you think about building up to that visibility, that full 100% visibility, while also adding value to current customers?

iPhone (226)
Yeah, I mean if we said, hey listen, we had this global vision day one and that it was all interconnected, that there would be an absolute lie we started with. And again, forgive my directness, that's all I know. We started with kind of what I'll call geography and mode specific expertise. So you start with, you know, less than truckload, you have truckload, you have different, you know, I'll call it even us modal applications, we start building kind of deep and deep in, and to some extent wide, but more deep in those particular modes. What ends up happening is those models expand and you go up market, especially to mid market and enterprise shippers. That chief supply chain officer, he or she, they just want one single lens of all exceptions and really prescriptive data behind the scenes.

iPhone (226)
They don't care about a boat, a train, a plane, a rickshaw. They don't care. They care about one single lens from origin to maybe on the ground in China. You know, ground ports, steamship, port, rail, truck, shuttle. They care about all those things and those applications around. They care about the end, the single status. At a glance they can get at the end of the day. And that was further perpetuated by Covid. So Covid made that because so many folks realized how far behind they really were, and it was kind of thrown back in their face in a way where they couldn't really. They didn't have the flexibility that further accelerated that narrative.

Emre Karatas
Yeah, yeah. And I like the way you phrased it at the beginning. You know, you were trying to sell to yourself as that ideal Persona. Are there any specific, you know, initial products or technology approaches that you think really resonated with, again, you as their Persona or potential customers as you came out the gate? Because we're always thinking about this. You know, it's great to collect all the data, but what are those one or two key pieces, whether it's a driver app, whether it's a particular function of the control tower, or really anything along that technology and product sophistication that really stuck out to you in the early days to really, again, build this network, build that full visibility?

iPhone (226)
Well, different technologies, I mean, they're not in that space, always scalable across. Across every geography and region. So, for example, a driver app, you drop that into Poland, and people will, you know, basically attack you at that point. So you got to be very careful with, you know, how you roll across different geographies when you think about product expansion and how we actually, you know, how we actually did that. And the way I think about these models, you start with wanting to have, really, a frictionless model, which we all envy, being able to be what I call PQL product qualified, lead driven. And it takes a while to get there. So you have to have some element of professional services, right, wrong or indifferent.

iPhone (226)
That what I call that the rocket booster, because you have a rocket and you're trying to make sure that rocket is essentially engaged within a frictionless manner. But the professional services piece is really necessary as a booster, and those boosters fall off because those boosters are really your change management and making sure that users know what problems they're solving and get it into their workflow.

Emre Karatas
And how did that, you know, service versus software or rocket versus rocket booster?

iPhone (226)
Yeah, sorry for the analogy. That's the way I think. I like it.

Emre Karatas
I like it. How did that evolve over time? Like, as you guys started to scale, did the number of ops people you need decrease or increase with more complexity?

iPhone (226)
We ran into the wall 10 times and learned what professional services actually was, and then we deployed that. But also the deployment of that had to come at a certain point of intersect Based on scale. So you know, as you know, early stages, a lot of times you're just hustling, they're signing a subscription deal, you're hustling behind the scenes. When you get to the point of scale and that different gator milestone then you can more, you know, more solidify and attach that too. It also in the case of Project 44, we knew shippers at the high ground but the reason were so successful for the first really three or four years we built a network around that and that network had so many, what I call influencers and impacts, so brokers, three PLs, carrier partners.

iPhone (226)
That network was really strong and led us to a place of being able to kind of surround shippers with the network. And that created, you know, our ability to get to the high ground from a go to market standpoint. And probably most importantly were able to have shortened sales cycles which obviously could be tough in the enterprise. And then our really what I call our sales to startup, our ability to implement in some cases was less than 30 days, not always, I mean, but a lot of times longer. But I mean were able to shorten that cycle. So obviously you know, time value, money.

Emre Karatas
Yeah, I like that analogy as well because in our pharma world, as Sean was alluding to at the beginning, that first big fish or big customer is the pharmaceutical manufacturers. And then they have their ecosystem around them touching on some of the same folks you mentioned, adding some more pharma healthcare specific folks like the actual contract manufacturing organizations, the contract research organizations, the wholesalers and distributors and the like. And so a lot of analogies we see there in the farm world as well on how to build this network which you can see a lot of our questions are around here.

iPhone (226)
Yeah, I think you're, I mean the way you're thinking about it, spot on. I think of it again, this is a bit of maybe an elementary thought, but I think of it as a spider web. But I also there's a lot of interconnected points in here, but companies that are what I'll call again varies by stage. In your first three or four years, if you come from that industry, 60 to 70% of your late stage deals should have impact or influence from somewhere in your network. And again in our world that could be, I said carrier partner. It could be, it could be a tms, it could be an erp, it could be a lot of things. But how do you kind of use a real pointed approach to be able to build the network to lift those things up.

iPhone (226)
And it's really important because when you're early, you don't have the credibility, let's call it what it is, you think you do, but you don't. And that gives you immediate credibility when everybody rallies around you to help lift.

Emre Karatas
Yep, yep. And we've been. Go, go for it. Sorry. Oh, sorry. That was a. That was my fault, Tom. I heard some background noise. Good for P44. I know you guys touched a lot of different industries. How have you guys, how did you think and how do you guys think about just healthcare, life sciences, pharma as an industry within the many you're serving today?

iPhone (226)
Not, not as much of a, you know, again, I've been a bit removed only, you know, distantly involved past years. But I mean really, the pharma piece, there were a couple of customers in that segment. It wasn't a, what I'd say a core competency of go to market. And I think that space has to have more specialization. And when you're selling to people in certain spaces like that, which I call that high value, you know, at the end of the day, if you don't know that space well, it's one of those spaces where you're quickly exposed. If you walk in and start trying to talk about comparing retail to pharma or something, it's almost like oil and gas. Give you an example. I walk into an oil and gas group and I'm talking about retail or food and beverage or like no, no timeout.

iPhone (226)
And they can know pretty quickly by the words you use if you know it pretty well or not. So I think that piece was probably. It was part of the network, but not a core part of the go to market. I'll put it that way.

Emre Karatas
It makes sense. It makes sense. And so I'm going back to some of your original comments, but it sounds like when you were getting P44 off the ground, just real time visibility in general, was that something that was top mind for buyers or was there some education involved in trying to get that over the line? I think we're just trying to understand the general evolution of supply chain.

iPhone (226)
Oh, education was big and we underestimated that too. We thought, because we knew it, everybody knew it. So think of transport, think of all modes and geographies as one master grid. And our thesis was let's automate the life cycle of a shipment across our initial modes, especially in the US So less than truckload and intermodal. Some of these modes that were US specific. In a lot of cases, we wanted to automate everything from the rate all the way to settlement. Frankly, in this market you can do that because a lot of the carrier partners and networks are mature enough to allow you to do it. In other markets, it's not. And then we quickly realized the pull we had was real time visibility.

iPhone (226)
So again, you had this big grid you're filling out and all of a sudden you're now striking all the way across your grid, going after real time visibility across every mode and every geography. And then our plan was to do that and then fill that grid in behind, you know, go back up to rating and down to settlement at the mode geography level as we did that. But again, also a lot of markets aren't as mature in certain parts of shipment life cycle. She had, you know, that vision was definitely module and iterative. It couldn't just be filled out overnight. But the real time visibility piece is what the big pull. And so then we found ourselves building out all these interconnections.

iPhone (226)
So I'm standing in Lithuania one morning looking around saying, okay, you know, I got it, you know, it's, you got to build out all these different interconnections that frankly are pretty tough to go do.

Emre Karatas
Yep, yep. And during that, you know, late 16, 17, through your role there, how do you think or what was the edge for you guys as you competed with some of these other real time visibility players? I'm sure you've seen we've been doing some work, but I'm sure you've seen a ton more than we've had with your work.

iPhone (226)
I mean, our edge was us. I mean, we don't know how to lose. And that's good and bad, by the way. You know, sometimes that, that you're so hell bent on winning that you chase the wrong things in perpetuity because you just don't want to lose. But sometimes it's okay to lose. You know, lose the battle, win the war. The old cliche. You know, I think we, we knew the network. We knew the network better than anybody. Let's call it what it is. Our network was the best, one of the best in the world. So I mean we leverage that and you know, we refused to lose.

iPhone (226)
Had a pretty lean team that was able to leverage that network for, I mean again, we would not be anywhere where the company is today without a lot of people in the network that I could put my arm around and say, without that person or that company, we don't exist. And so they were able to really pick us up and bring us to a place that we hadn't gone to before. And you know, Jet and I'm probably a little more like open than most, but we learned a lot because the transition you're going through. We're transportation brokerage and asset folks. And the analogy is when you insert best in class companies today have a mix of outside folks in the industry and inside folks. You can't go inside only or outside only. You're going to fail.

iPhone (226)
I believe you've got to have a mix of both of those people. And we had to learn how to go from muscle to scale. And in transportation when something breaks, you throw money, grit something at it. And in technology you break something. And so we had to be careful to learn. It's still again, one of my analogies, use your screwdriver, not your hammer.

Emre Karatas
Yeah.

iPhone (226)
And you know we brought a lot of hammers initially and that's not what we needed. We had to get to bring our screwdrivers.

Kunaal Patel
Yeah, super helpful. And early on in the network when you're trying to build out the network, how much of it was integrating with carrier systems or having to go direct with like integrating with hardware to pull the data off of it, like with telematics.

iPhone (226)
So typically, and that kind of varies by mode, but your network build out. So if you look at, you know, really the best high fidelity data comes from either a direct API with a care partner or with their telematics device directly. And that was your initial build because you're trying to create a one to many environment. Now in the US space, the top 12 telematics groups are still probably 65% and then you have a long tail. So we did focus on, based on what we knew about the networks, what to go to first and build. And so you think of our network being built out. We picked your top 12 to 15 telematics groups, we picked your top 100 carriers that we knew had APIs around that and then you picked your top three or four TMS.

iPhone (226)
This is much more on the customer side to make sure once we integrated with the customer, once we sold them, that they had a smooth path and that was inside their workflow from day one.

Emre Karatas
Yeah, yeah, that's very helpful. And I was asking about the driver app for and to your point, I don't know if that's going to fly in Lithuania or whatever other parts of.

iPhone (226)
Your, I mean again, you know, not in China and not in parts of Southeast Asia and not in most of Europe. And so the way that you get visibility today, I mean, you've got to go through a series of drop downs. You go through, you know, direct APIs with operating systems of some type. And I mean I could go to marine terminals and then you go to a kind of a telematics if you're going to the truck or the box if you're, you know, if you're tracking a box or something like that, it may be a container, it could be a international domestic container. And then usually what I call your app is your fallback. You want to have your app as your fallback and then you want to use your app especially like in the case of U.S.

iPhone (226)
Trucking, you have some exemptions for telematics and short haul like at ports, for example. And that's where you have to deploy your app sometimes to be able to capture the data there. But your app is not your first lens in. Everybody has an app and then drivers have app fatigue. So your network gets drugged down. And if you're going to build an app, you got to go all in to have enough amenities on the app to help the network want to use the app versus seeing as just something else like everybody else has.

Sean Doolan
Yeah, Tommy, you maybe going back a few minutes so you know, you referenced the, it comes to pharma, the higher value nature of it specialization required. Did you guys at P44 ever broach pharma as a sector to attack address? And if so, I mean what did you. Were there any specific things that you learned that kept you from penetrating that market?

iPhone (226)
I would say our approach was more about. So to answer your first question, yes we did, but not strategically, only opportunistic like Abbie and a couple of some early customers. And our goal was to build around that. But there wasn't a big concentration of pharma folks that were part of that. Again, it was a, I almost called a sub vertical. And furthermore, you, then you end up chasing tam. So you know, let's say, well, why would you chase Walmart? Because Walmart's going to commoditize you and it's going to drag you down. Well, you chase Walmart because they have, you know, 9,000 suppliers. You know, why do you chase Dollar General? They're going to commoditize you, but they have 7,000 suppliers.

iPhone (226)
So you're always looking at the network and so you're chasing these bigger tans that have these exponential expansions on Them that sometimes you don't see directly in the pharma space. And this is an opinion, not a fact. I think the pharma sales cycle was a longer sales cycle that had more requirements, especially from a security standpoint, than most folks were accustomed to. Yep. Again, that's a, that's a subjective comment. I could not. You could definitely poke a hole in it if you wanted to.

Sean Doolan
I think that's fair. Absolutely. Just based off of what we're hearing.

Emre Karatas
Yeah, I agree. Yeah, I agree. And with the Walmart or Dollar General, can you so like the way you phrase that? If you break that down, what were the. How do you weigh the positives and negatives and navigate through those big customers? At least in the P44 mindset, you can't have.

iPhone (226)
If you, if you land the big elephant, you gotta have a very clear scope. And if scope creep happens, you get killed.

Emre Karatas
Yeah.

iPhone (226)
So you've gotta be very clear. You've also gotta be integrated inside their current workflows and TMSs and operating systems that they have, in this case SAP or Blue yonder, whatever it is. And then. But you gotta weigh the commoditization of the big logo against what they can bring as a network. So if they want, in this case, visibility, and they want visibility outbound and inbound, well, guess what? Inbound is going to come from all those suppliers.

Emre Karatas
Yep.

iPhone (226)
So naturally you get that visibility on the inbound that you would not have otherwise.

Emre Karatas
No, it's very helpful, man. Well, I'm trying to gather some of our questions so we could ask the best ones.

iPhone (226)
Yeah, I mean, again, this is what I'm sharing. Again, I'm happy to share learnings. None of this is a secret or proprietary. It's, it's really learnings and I talk openly about it because I'm so proud of that group and where it is today and where it continues to go. But you know, we had a lot of good learnings on the way and I think if you don't step back and know what you learn from, then you know, that's how we all get better, as you know.

Emre Karatas
Yeah. And I think I was. Obviously a lot of this discussion has been focused on P44. I saw you're also involved with companies like Navix. Sorry if I'm butchering that. But I think another interesting angle when we look at pharma specific solutions is because of that maniacal focus one industry and one customer type, you can theoretically build out deep, like you can expand the product set and the product features more quickly. So you can start to think about financial auditing, you can start to think more about insurance for those high value shipments. You can start to just layer on more of these, whether it's financial or other workflows that are very specific to that customer set.

iPhone (226)
You can, I call it layering the cake. And you know we had a company called My Carrier in Arizona which is a TMS and the TMS is really for the purchase of SMB shippers. But I mean that's a good example of a company that has a variety of products but layered the cake with initially automation for those folks. Then you have data and then you have things like insurance, right? Yep. And so you layer with all those things. Those are all value adds on top that you can succinctly kind of roll out. I think that applies in multiple spaces.

Emre Karatas
Yep, yep. Well, yeah, like I, I don't know Sean Canal, if you guys had anything else. But I want to be respectful of your time timing. This has been so incredibly helpful.

iPhone (226)
Yeah, I mean happy to share. Congrats to you guys and I know you're looking at different companies and again just let me know if I can help you. I'm happy to share input and I focus most of my time now on things I know very little about which is a pretty long list. So it's, you know, a lot of my learnings or you know, I'm pointing myself more towards and I'm going to say AI and we can all laugh but trying to because in the transportation brokerage space and Transport in general, AI is going to, it's 190% positive. It's going to play a massive role. You know, it's a function of how and when and where and like anything else.

iPhone (226)
And so I mean as we learn about these new technologies, what's going to happen in our space, we're trying to make sure the string gets pulled. You're not pushing the string and that's the. I know you know what I mean by that. But it's a lot of good learnings. I'm in the healthcare space now which is adjacent to transportation with interstate health systems. Again, my healthcare knowledge is something measurably less than zero and it's so trying to probably similar to what you're doing. How do you combine adjacent spaces to be able to capture the benefits of all.

Sean Doolan
Yeah, I mean this has been great. Again, just want to say, you know, thank you and I really appreciate you taking time out of your day and. And doing so in such a quick turn on.

iPhone (226)
Yeah, sure, guys. Absolutely. Congratulations to you and your team. And keep doing it. I'm here if you guys ever need any help. Just give me a shot.

Sean Doolan
Awesome. Thanks, Tommy.

iPhone (226)
Yep. Take care. Bye.

Emre Karatas
Thank you.
