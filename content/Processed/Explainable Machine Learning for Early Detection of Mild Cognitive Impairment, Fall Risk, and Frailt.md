## Abstract

Objective: This study aimed to design and evaluate an explainable machine learning (ML) framework that integrates sensor-based motor assessments with demographic and clinical data to identify early indicators of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), fall risk, and frailty in older adults. Methods: Eighty-three community-dwelling older adults (60 years or older) completed multimodal motor assessments using the Mizzou Point-of-Care Assessment System (MPASS) to capture synchronized gait, balance, and sit-to-stand performance. Sensor-derived motor features were combined with demographic and clinical variables to develop predictive models for MCI, frailty, and fall risk using XGBoost and Decision Tree algorithms. A unified multilabel framework was also developed using XGBoost, Decision Tree, and AdaBoost to predict all three outcomes. Model interpretability was evaluated using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). Results: The ML model for MCI achieved the highest performance (94% accuracy, AUC = 0.88, F1 = 0.94), followed by fall risk (94% accuracy, AUC = 0.90) and frailty (82% accuracy, AUC = 0.77). Unified multilabel models showed moderate performance (67-73% accuracy), with XGBoost achieving the highest accuracy (73%), sensitivity, and F1 score, while the Decision Tree showed higher discrimination (AUC = 0.72). SHAP analyses identified stride length and time, center-of-pressure-based balance measures, and knee angular velocity during sit-to-stand as dominant predictors. Conclusions: This work introduces a novel ML framework using multimodal sensor-based motor assessments to predict MCI, fall risk, and frailty individually and within a unified model. By combining explainable ML with objective motor-function data, the framework supports transparent early screening of multidomain cognitive and physical decline in aging. Keywords: Explainable machine learning, Sensor-based motor assessment, Mild cognitive impairment, Fall risk, and Frailty.
