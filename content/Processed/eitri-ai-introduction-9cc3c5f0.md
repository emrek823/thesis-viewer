## Slide 3: Growing product complexity, outsourcing, and regulatory changes are escalating the problems

**40%+**
of biopharma companies expect their manufacturing cost of goods to increase over the next 3-5 years¹

**Biologics % of FDA Approvals**

| Year | % Biologics |
| :--- | :---------- |
| 2000 | ~20%        |
| 2005 | ~30%        |
| 2010 | ~25%        |
| 2015 | ~35%        |
| 2020 | ~40%        |

## Slide 4: Manufacturing is dominated by manual workflows that increase time, cost, and risk

*   **Process Development**
    *   Scientists conduct dozens of bench-scale runs to **optimize unit operations and parameters** and draft a "Process Description"
    *   **6-12+ months**
*   **Partner Selection**
    *   Sponsor issues an **RFP** to contract manufacturers (CDMOs). CDMOs submit proposals, which the sponsor reviews manually.
    *   **6+ months**
*   **Knowledge Transfer**
    *   Sponsor and CDMO **compare the Process Description to the CDMO's capabilities**, identify gaps and risks, and draft transfer artifacts.
    *   **8+ months**
*   **Quality Assurance**
    *   CDMO shares batch results with the sponsor, who **confirms that they match prior results** and resolves any significant deviations
    *   **1+ months**
*   **Capacity Management**
    *   Sponsors and CDMOs manually track capacity across sites manually **inform CapEx allocation decisions.**
    *   **1+ months**

## Slide 5: AI is going to transform manufacturing operations from end to end

*   **Process Development**
    *   Embedded AI copilots will predict optimal process steps and parameters using historical data.
*   **Partner Selection**
    *   Bespoke search agents will analyze vendor proposals for critical expertise and capabilities and recommend best fits.
*   **Knowledge Transfer**
    *   AI-native data platforms will automatically compare requirements, assess risks, and generate transfer documents.
*   **Quality Assurance**
    *   Embedded AI copilots will track real-time deviations, identify root cause, and recommend remediations based on historical data.
*   **Capacity Management**
    *   Agent swarms will ingest cross-functional supply chain data to visualize capacity, and recommend allocation decisions.

## Slide 18: Knowledge transfer is the bottleneck in scaling new treatments from lab to patient

Every drug product needs to **transfer process know-how and requirements from research to manufacturing** before it can start clinical trials or launch in the market.

Knowledge transfer today is painfully inefficient, and **introduces significant cost, time delay, and quality risk.**

*   **$1M+** added cost
*   **6+** month delays
*   **20%+** of batches fail spec

---

## Slide 19: Knowledge transfer is a manual process...

**Left Diagram:**
1.  **Research** drafts process requirement documents, and reviews manufacturing process and results
2.  **Manufacturing** compares requirements to facility capabilities, and drafts a manufacturing process

**Right Bullet Points:**
*   **X Hundreds of hours** drafting and comparing documents line-by-line
*   **X Missed process differences lead to failed batches and repeated runs**
*   **X Fragmented manufacturing data requires ongoing, manual analysis**

---

## Slide 20: ...that recurs throughout the drug development life cycle

**Manufacturing process definition and new product introduction**
*   **6-8 months** (Preclinical)

**Scale up to support pivotal trials and market launch**
*   **1-3 months** (Phase 1/2 Clinical, Phase 3 & Marketing)

**Scale down to match decreasing demand**
*   **1-3 months** (Life Cycle Management)
