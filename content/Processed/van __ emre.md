### SafetyNet Overview and Value Proposition

- No meaningful lives currently exist in Sentinel universe for safety surveillance
- Giant self-insured employers face data fragmentation challenges
- Focus on safety only, not HEOR - pursuing HEOR risks losing payers due to discomfort with data sharing
- All payers will govern heavily if moving beyond safety into marketing universe
- SpaceX/NASA analogy: Can have private sector solution alongside government program
- Largest client is one of the 5 major payers; positive early traction

### Stakeholder Strategy

- Three key stakeholder groups need clear value props:
	- Regulatory agencies require improved capabilities
	- Payers need economic incentives (revenue sharing model still in development)
	- Pharma companies need reliable access
- Revenue sharing structure: Can share considerable proceeds per project with source payers
- Important note: “This is never going to look like a big business to any payer”
- Current state: Pharma companies “stumble ass backward” into getting Sentinel support
- Low hit rates with Carelon/Optum due to lack of upfront understanding and reliability

### Technical Architecture

- SafetyNet does not share data - it shares methods, designs, results, and standards
- Federated AI capabilities for validation in Sentinel-like universe
- When organizations join, they establish participability of their data
- Must understand healthcare ambiguities and “know the ropes”
- Query cycle process:
	- Requirements come in from users
	- Convert to query designs
	- Accumulate reporting
	- May require significant data curation

### Use Case: Drug Development Impact

- Phase III compound considerations:
	- Trial costs plus inevitable PMR (Post-Marketing Requirements)
	- PMR feasibility now factors into drug development calculus
	- PMRs are increasing in frequency
- GBS (Guillain-Barré Syndrome) example demonstrates recurring challenge
- Current process like “boat sales” vs needed reliability of regular flights

### Operational Improvements

- Current Sentinel has ~70M lives vs promised 100M
- Must improve data accuracy and cross-payer validation
- Need predictable programs with critical alternatives
- Goal: Make safety surveillance reliable and proactive vs reactive
- Must avoid overreach into commercial applications that could threaten core safety mission

### Technology & Infrastructure

- Focus on code base for federated data curation
- Query systems handle requirement intake and results aggregation
- Emphasis on maintaining data provenance while enabling aggregation
- Infrastructure supports indefinite data access for regulatory verification
