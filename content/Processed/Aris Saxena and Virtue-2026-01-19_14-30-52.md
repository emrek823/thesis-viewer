### Revenue Recognition Discussion

- Current live ARR: $1.5M (signed and operational)
- Pending contracts (expected signature within 2-3 weeks): $1.2M additional
	- Sanofi: Dupixent and General Medicine teams
	- Other pipeline contracts in final stages
- Agreement to report as “live run rate” vs “booked ARR”
	- Eliminates misleading categorization of unsigned contracts
	- Pipeline remains separate category
	- Small time gap between signing and going live (2-3 weeks max)

### Contract Structure & Business Model

- Replacing traditional marketing agencies through SOW-based contracts
	- MSAs (4-5 year agreements) are the challenging component
	- Individual SOWs executed quarterly/periodically under MSAs
	- Live with all major contracts as of Friday (Pfizer goes live)
- Revenue model clarification:
	- Run rate vs recurring revenue distinction
	- 12+ month contracts can be labeled recurring
	- Strong product-market fit evidenced by 10+ signed contracts
- UCB example: 3-month contracts with quarterly renewals expected
	- Pattern of continuous SOW renewals replacing agency relationships

### Financial Model Updates Required

- Forecast model needs alignment with sales pipeline data
- Expansion revenue section needs detailed breakdown by customer
	- Replace generic ACV assumptions with specific brand-by-brand projections
	- Show AstraZeneca, Takeda multi-brand expansion plans
	- Demonstrate concrete path to 2026-2027 revenue targets
- Historical P&L reconciliation with pipeline numbers

### Fundraising Strategy & Timeline

- Tier 2/3 investors first for practice rounds
- Tier 1 firms (Sequoia, GC) after rhythm established
- Byron call scheduled for 4:30 PM Eastern
- Coordination between Emre, Sean, and Dee Dee on investor introductions
- Consider delaying 1-2 weeks if additional contract signatures expected
	- Potential 40% revenue increase during fundraising process
	- Balance timing vs execution risk
