## Slide 5: Direct time optimization results in hundreds of millions in savings, not to mention revenue uplift from faster release of marketing campaign

**Calculation of Savings**

*   **$20K** Cost from time spent per tactic
*   **500** # of tactics per year per brand
*   **50%** % time saved from use of Revisto
*   **= $5M** Savings from use of Revisto per brand

$5M savings per brand, and savings will increase over time
as Revisto's AI model learns from use. Large pharma has 40+
brands, which means savings of over $200M
