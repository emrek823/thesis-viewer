Unlocking Practice
Performance in Value-
Based Care

## Slide 2: Value-Based Care: A Growing Market...
### Value-Based Care: A Growing Market...
*   **Market Expected to Triple by 2030**
    CMS aims for 100% of Medicare patients to participate in total cost of care models by 2030, implying 50M+ new beneficiaries over the next 5 years
*   **Attractive New Models for Participation**
    Recent expansions in the ACO model through the MSSP Flex Program include $250k upfront payments for new ACOs, enhancing attractiveness for practices
*   **Growing Investor Interest**
    Private capital inflows to value-based care companies increased more than 4x from 2019 to 2021, as investors follow the creation of $1 trillion in new enterprise value for payers, providers, and investors

### ...But Massive Untapped Execution Opportunities
*   **$7B**
    ACOs captured less than $4B of shared savings in 2022, leaving an estimated $7B on the table in the Medicare Shared Savings Program alone¹
*   **33%**
    Despite the incentives, 33% of ACOs did not earn any shared savings revenue last year; 84% of these have been in the program for over three years
*   **20%**
    Less than 20% of high-risk patients currently receive an Annual Wellness Visit, missing a key preventive measure that is highly correlated with lower healthcare costs

1) Internal analysis of 2022 MSSP ACO performance. Total savings opp. includes $5.5B from delivering Annual Wellness Visits on high-risk patients, $3.6B in savings from chronic-condition coding recapture and $2.5B from ensuring patients receive Transitional Care visits after inpatient episode.

## Slide 3: The Opportunity
### The Opportunity
Practice workflow optimization is an overlooked driver of VBC success

**Graph: Market Growth vs. Market Maturity**
The graph depicts three phases of Value-Based Care (VBC) evolution on an X-axis representing Market Maturity and a Y-axis representing Market Growth, with an overall Market Potential indicated. "We are here" is positioned within the VBC 2.0 phase.

*   **VBC 1.0**
    Adjusts financial models to incentivize physicians to consider cost & quality outcomes
*   **VBC 2.0**
    Builds capacity to analyze patient level data & prioritize biggest intervention opportunities at the point of care
*   **VBC 3.0**
    Redesigns practice operational & clinical workflows to optimize for competing FFS & VBC business models

## Slide 4: The Problem
### The Problem
Patient insights alone don't create action

**You can tell practices...**
*   Which of their patients need to be seen
*   What care gaps need to be closed during a visit
*   What recent episodes of care need follow up
*   What other care patients are receiving outside of office

**...but practices don't know**
*   How to find time to see extra patients
*   How to find time in a visit to check more boxes
*   How to find and pay staff to do extra work
*   How to design efficient workflows for 5-10 new value-based care services

Value-Based Care means reengineering clinical workflows around a fundamentally different business model... but who is supporting this change?

## Slide 5: The Problem
### The Problem
Practice-level insights are key driver of long-term VBC performance...

| Insight Category                    | Impact                                                                                                                                                                                |
| :---------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Provider Rounding Preferences**   | Can have unintended impacts on attributed patient-mix, driving up per-capita costs                                                                                                    |
| **Practice Staff Recruitment and Churn** | Can impact growth and execution of key VBC tasks such as patient outreach                                                                                                             |
| **Same-day Appointment Availability** | Can influence patient decisions as to whether to seek care in the ED                                                                                                                  |
| **After-hours Call Coverage**       | Quality and availability can influence patients decision to use the ED                                                                                                                |
| **Advanced Practice Provider Billing Preferences** | Can negatively influence patient attribution in VBC contracts                                                                                                               |
| **EHR/PM System Optimization**      | Can influence provider productivity and patient RAF score                                                                                                                             |
| **New Patient Appointment Availability** | Has impact on long term attribution growth and patient-mix                                                                                                                            |
| **Billing & Coding Workflows**      | Heavily influence patient RAF score and can lead to lost attribution if claims are denied                                                                                             |
