## Slide 5: Meet our next-generation AI

# Meet our next-generation AI

**Complex PAs**
*   55 min to complete a PA
*   Denials due to changing policies
*   Not guaranteed compliance

**LATENT**

**Streamlined PAs**
*   15 mins to complete a PA
*   Real-time notifications to rule changes
*   Guaranteed compliance

## Slide 6: Projected Timeline

# Projected Timeline

**Timeline Stages:**
*   Speciality Pharma PA (0 to ~1.5)
*   PA Expansion (0.5 to ~2)
*   Specialty PA Full Automation (1.25 to ~2.75)
*   Future NLP Applications (~2.25 to 3+)

**PA Expansion**
*   Utilize Latent's Medical Language Models to automate other prior authorization workflows (infusions, cardiology, etc)

**Specialty PA Full Automation**
*   Latent's productivity suite will be iterated on to adapt to customer feedback regarding PA workflows, status, submission, and appeals
*   End-to-end automation without human assist with regular reporting on AI confidence intervals and human-in-the-loop for verification

**Future NLP applications**
*   Clinical Registries, Centers of Excellence, Accountable Care Organizations

## Slide 11: PA process is getting exponentially worse

# PA process is getting exponentially worse

*   70% of all drugs in development will be classified as specialty pharmaceuticals
*   40% projected annual growth in specialty pharmacy (2022-2027)

Speciality PAs are **doubling** every three years
Completing PAs requires **careful comprehension** of the **patient notes** in the EHR

**Data is exploding**, health systems cannot continue to manually authorize accurately and efficiently

**Projected unstructured text/pt in EHRs (Bar Chart)**

# Latent is an end-to-end solution

*   **Productivity suite** - a one-stop shop for operations that manages tracking, filling, and submitting prior authorizations
*   **Easy integration** with Epic and FHIR. Prior authorizations can be input and output in any format, including ePA or PDF
*   **Reduce denials** with our rules engine that proactively alerts you on implicit or explicit payor rule changes. Get alerted **before** denials happen
*   **Stay compliant** with payor policies. Our rules engine learns from past denials and can easily be adjusted
*   **Free FTEs**. Latent AI reduces the amount of time taken for each prior authorization by 92%
*   **Explainability** with Latent Cognition. Every AI suggestion includes generated reasoning, so a human can always confirm the requirement

## Slide 13: Architecture

\*In conversation with Yale

# Architecture

**(Diagram)**

*   **Input:**
    *   Prescription (from Doctor)
    *   Payor Clinical Policies
*   **Core System:** LATENT
*   **Data Flow:**
    *   Prescription -> Epic
    *   Epic -> PA Specialist
    *   Epic also feeds into LATENT via:
        *   MedicationRequest (CDS Hook)
        *   Patient Notes (FHIR v4)
        *   SMART on FHIR (HyperSpace)
    *   Payor Clinical Policies -> LATENT
*   **LATENT Capabilities:**
    *   AI Bias Monitoring
    *   HIPAA Compliant
*   **Output:**
    *   LATENT -> Any Output (pdf, ePA, Epic)

## Slide 14: Implementation

# Implementation

## Integration + Workflow

**Integration + Workflow**
*   Immediate access to **Latent Knowledge Base** of updated payor policies
*   Work with pharmacy leadership and integration team to ensure easy workflow adoption and data flow
*   Third party security audit
*   Kick-off on Jan 30th\*

## Timeline

*   **0 -> 2 (Phase 1)**
    *   Select drug cohort for highest volume, highest revenue drugs across single payor.
    *   Complete PAs for Drug Cohort using **Latent Platform**
*   **2 -> 3 (Go Live)**
*   **3 -> 6 (Phase 2)**
    *   Multi-payor expanded drug cohort
    *   Transition all specialty pharmacy prior authorization workloads to the Latent platform
    *   **Live Dashboard** with metrics
    *   **PA Productivity Suite**
*   **6 -> 9 (Data Study)**
    *   Compile Dashboard Analytics and Metric Report for 2023
    *   Review with Digital and Pharmacy stakeholders

## Success Metrics
