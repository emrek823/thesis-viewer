Hey guys,

Wanted to share this list for industry outreach. Some we've already spoken to or have the relationship with. Others we're navigating through corporate innovation teams or speaking later this week / early next.

Also, do you guys have a blurb or any sales materials we can help get together? Even within pharma (before getting to CROs, CDMOs, etc) the supply chain touches a lot and means different things to different people so we've been trying to tailor the message as much as possible.
