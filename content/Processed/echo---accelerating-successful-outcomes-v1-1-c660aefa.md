## Slide 3: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)

3
echo

### Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)

**Autism Facts**

*   **50% of ALL healthcare costs for kids aged 0 – 10 are related to Autism**
*   **The average cost of Autism therapy is $63,000 per year**
*   **CDC estimates that 1 in 44 children have ASD and this is expected to grow to 1 in 30**
*   **Parental involvement is a critical success factor that improves outcomes**

**Industry Needs an All-In-One Parental Involvement Solution**

*   Parental involvement is a critical success factor that improves outcomes and accelerates therapy fade
*   Less than 10% of families are involved in the therapy of their child
*   On average, less than 30% of authorized parent training hours are used
*   Existing solutions in the market are disparate, not integrated, complicated, and do not actively facilitate parental involvement

**Health Plans and Providers Need a Seamless Data Exchange**

*   Health plans receive thousands of assessments per month via email where the data is not standardized and cannot be reported
*   Health plans struggle to measure care quality and progress over time
*   There are no preferred provider networks as health plans struggle to identify top performing providers
*   Providers see delays in starting care due to paper based assessments

## Slide 4: Problem: No Parental Involvement

4
echo

### Problem:
No Parental Involvement

*   Studies show that parental involvement can accelerate therapy fade by 6 – 18 months however **less than 10% of all families are properly trained and involved.**
*   Parents know their child best but their deep and intimate knowledge is often not used in crafting treatment plans.
*   Providers are not able to adequately train families (<30% of authorized parent training used), and payers have no visibility of goal progress.
*   Successful therapy involves being able to smoothly transition skill mastery across multiple locations and environments (facility to home etc.). Parental involvement facilitates this.

## Slide 5: Problem: Capturing & Measuring Data

5
echo

### Problem:
Capturing & Measuring Data

**Health Plans Lack a Seamless Data Exchange to Measure Progress and Top Performing Providers**

*   Unstandardized data makes it impossible to measure progress
*   Health plans cannot identify top performing providers
*   No visibility of stakeholder goals or progress in the home
*   Cannot apply care quality metrics at scale across their entire member base

**Visual Description:**
A graphic shows numerous icons representing assessments (documents with checkboxes) being emailed and faxed in unstandardized formats, all funneling down into "Optum".
*   Thousands of assessments emailed & faxed in unstandardized formats
*   Optum

## Slide 6: Problem: Administrative Burden

6
echo

### Problem:
Administrative Burden

**The Lack of a Seamless Data Exchange Results In:**

*   Inefficient resource-intensive processes with unstandardized data coming in from many different sources
*   Manual processes that are expensive and financially inefficient
*   Less effective and overworked case managers with unstandardized data coming in from many different sources
*   Delays in starting of treatment often leading to exacerbated issues and missed opportunities

**Visual Description:**
An image of a person sitting at a desk with their head in their hands, surrounded by stacks of paper and files, indicating stress from administrative burden. Below it, a graphic depicts numerous email and fax icons converging into a chaotic network of arrows, suggesting unstandardized data flow.

## Slide 13: Incentivizing Providers to Engage Parents

13
echo

### Providers are critical stakeholders to maximize engagement

**Incentivizing Providers to Engage Parents**

Parental involvement is critical however it happens less than 10% of the time.

Providers are important to help facilitate parental involvement in therapy. Providers have ongoing touchpoints with family members, and incentivizing providers will increase their involvement with families.

**Through Echo, providers can maximize their parent training reimbursement.**

**Process:**
1.  Provider assigns parent goals on Echo
2.  Parents complete goals and track notes on Echo mobile app
3.  For every goal completed, health plans reimburse provider 2 units of CPT 97156 (parent training)

**Providers can make an extra $100 - $150 per client per month. This is a significant opportunity for providers!**

## Slide 14: Echo Benefits All Stakeholders

    *   **Early Intensive Behavioral Intervention (EIBI)**
        *   Discrete Trial Training (DTT)
        *   LEAP
    *   **Naturalistic Developmental Behavioral Intervention (NDBI)**
        *   Pivotal Response Training
        *   Early Start Denver Model
        *   JASPER
*   **Developmental Relationship Based Intervention (DRBI)**
    *   PACT
    *   PLAY
    *   Floor Time

**Limited Evidence:**
*   Relationship Development Intervention (RDI)
*   Animal Assisted Therapy (AAT) & Music Therapy (MT)

**Evidence Against:**
*   Facilitated Communication (FC)

**Pie Chart: Therapies for Autism**

| Therapy Type | Approximate Percentage |
|---|---|
| Contemporary ABA | ~75% |
| DRBI (Developmental Relationship Based Intervention) | ~15% |
| RDI (Relationship Development Intervention) | ~6% |
| AAT/MT (Animal Assisted Therapy & Music Therapy) | ~3% |
| FC (Facilitated Communication) | ~1% |

## Slide 18: Contemporary Applied Behavioral Analysis

18
echo

### Contemporary Applied Behavioral Analysis

Contemporary ABA isn't a "treatment package" – it's guiding principles of human learning used to create individualized treatment plans. Treatment plans today are naturalistic and incorporate a combination of many treatment protocols tailored the child's individual needs for optimal success.

**Contemporary ABA (Components illustrated in a diagram):**
*   Discrete Trial Teaching
*   Naturalistic Teaching
*   Pivotal Response Therapy
*   Token Economy
*   Contingent Observation

## Slide 19: Alternative Therapies & Benefits

19
echo

### Alternative Therapies & Benefits

While Contemporary ABA is widely acknowledged for its strong clinical evidence, alternative therapies can demonstrate benefits in specific situations. Echo supports autism therapy across many different treatment protocols including:

**Developmental Relationship Based Intervention (DRBI)**
*   Focuses on the entire individual
*   Works to understand internal events of the child to work through barriers
*   Focuses on training parents and their participation in treatment interventions

**Relationship Development Intervention (RDI)**
*   Relationship based
*   Focused on activities that develop relational bonds between child and adult
*   Uses activities that promote opportunities for the bond

**Animal Assisted Therapy (AAT) & Music Therapy (MT)**
*   Supplemental
*   Uses the bond with an animal to teach communication skills through gestures
*   Music can be an activity that supports the child's motivation to participate in interactions and connect with people

**Pie Chart: Therapies for Autism (same as Slide 17, confirming data)**

| Therapy Type | Approximate Percentage |
|---|---|
| Contemporary ABA | ~75% |
| DRBI (Developmental Relationship Based Intervention) | ~15% |
| RDI (Relationship Development Intervention) | ~6% |
| AAT/MT (Animal Assisted Therapy & Music Therapy) | ~3% |
| FC (Facilitated Communication) | ~1% |

## Slide 20: "Fad Treatments Are a Triple Threat"

20
echo

### "Fad Treatments Are a Triple Threat" (Zane, 2008)

Fad treatments increase the financial, emotional, and time burden of parents and children with autism, and decrease the chances of the child living a life as independent as possible.

1.  Fad treatments waste money that could be used in providing effective treatment
2.  They waste precious time that a child with autism needs to be supported with therapy proven to be effective in increasing skills
3.  Fad treatments provide false hope to concerned parents and caregivers

## Slide 21: Evolution of ABA Therapy

### Evolution of ABA Therapy

**Timeline:**

*   **1970 – 1990**
    *   Scientific
    *   Rigid
    *   Aversive
    *   Not Individualized

*   **1990 – 2010**
    *   More Widely Recognized
    *   Still Rigid
    *   Not Individualized

*   **2010 – Present**
    *   "Contemporary ABA"
    *   Highly Individualized
    *   More Natural Interactions
    *   Child Led
    *   Support Neurodiversity

## Slide 22: Misconceptions of ABA

22
echo

### Misconceptions of ABA

| Misconception | Response |
|---|---|
| **ABA uses cruel punishment procedures** | • ABA bases treatment responses on principles of learning <br> • Modern ABA focuses on positive interactions and teaches self-advocacy <br> • "ABA follows the least restrictive treatment model", (Schreck & Miller, 2010) <br> • "Professionals use punishment only with severe behavior" (Schreck & Miller, 2010) |
| **ABA is rigid and teaches mechanical responding** | • Focus is on transparency and emphasizes social validity of the approaches utilized <br> • Programs target significant behaviors to make a lasting impact in clients' lives <br> • ABA emphasizes generalization so that learners are able to use the skills they learn and adapt to new situations |
| **ABA tries to make autistic children look "normal"** | • Focus is the function of a behavior and teaches skills to meet the function safely <br> • Does not aim to change the way children think or feel <br> • Focus is on individual's strengths and teaches new skills to be independent <br> • Celebrates neurodiversity individualized to each learner's specific strengths and support needs |

echo

### What Are Parents Saying?

**Parents are frustrated**

We've interviewed families with Autistic children to get their feedback. Here are insightful examples of what they are saying:

*   “I want to get involved but don't know how”
*   “I see so many behavioral traits at home that I wish the therapist saw and included in the treatment plan from the start”
*   “We are tracking progress notes on a notepad at home. Sometimes providers might have a Google sheet"
*   “We have switched providers multiple times because they did not help us to get involved at home”

**Large Quote Callout:**
“I want to get involved but don't know how”
