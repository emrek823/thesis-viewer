Step 1. How do we pitch value prop in initial conversations? How do talking points differ (if at all) from biopharma sponsors and LSPs?

Step 2. How does feedback from those conversations inform product build (integrations, UI, etc)?

### CDMO: Focus downstream in process with more specialized CDMOs

Pharma Supply Chain of the Future

Market Trends. Historically, the market has been reliant on India and China for APIs. CDMOs are looking to expand along the value chain (from research to packaging), expand to different drug types (e.g., CGT), add new dosage forms (e.g., sterile liquids), and expand geographically (move away from India and China) (link). While the BIOSECURE Act has not been enacted into law as of today its consideration has already influenced strategic decisions within the CDMO industry (e.g., localization, resilience, etc) .

Product hypotheses. If we break down simply how CDMOs think about the supply chain, it includes 1) advanced planning for the long-tail of suppliers, 2) optimizing processes on the manufacturing floor, and 3) external supply chain to move product outside of the facility. 3 is closer to ZL current capabilities

Advanced Planning Systems for Long-tail of Suppliers. As an example, CDMO faced significant delays due to reliance on a single supplier for a critical chemical, which had a lead time of 24 weeks. This bottleneck threatened production schedules and client commitments (link). ZL can help identify weak parts of the supplier network with supplier analysis report.

Optimizing process on manufacturing floor. CDMOs need to adopt advanced scheduling tools (raw material availability, equipment preparation, etc) that are dependent on optimal supply chain and things showing up on time. ZL can help with this scheduling process that is currently in excel today.

Supply chain for commercial / clinical research (Pfizer, Thermo). Similar to the current solution and UI. It seems it’s just targeted towards a different user but need to learn more.

GTM. Working to understand the right decision points and trigger points for buying decisions to reduce sales cycle. In the Pfizer example, the sponsor had to take a month off to switch CDMOs. CDMOs are looking to localize/on-shore which can be an opportunity. Contracts have long lead times. The initial hypothesis is to start with specialized CDMOs because they inherently will have to coordinate with more players in the ecosystem and are less likely to have capabilities in-house.

### Wholesalers: Distribution and logistics are core business, but need novel solutions to support closer integrations with providers.

Cardinal Health Nov_24 Investor Presentation

Market Trends. Drug distributors and wholesalers are moving to vertically integrate with physician groups to capture downstream specialty drug spend. Cardinal Health acquired GI Alliance for $2.8B in 2024, Cencora bought Retinal Consultants of America for $4.6B in 2024, while McKesson has been a leader in oncology since its acquisition of US Oncology in 2010. This is a shift to capture margin, but it necessitates a tighter integration with providers and patients that goes beyond smart warehousing and inventory

Product hypotheses. These wholesales have built out transport (internal 3PL capabilities or acquisition like World Courier) and are layering on visibility solutions over last ~3 years (Cardinal Health + Four Kites, Mckesson + Transvoyant, Cencora + Controlant).

Cardinal Health

FourKites. Real-time visibility solutions but includes PPE, medical devices, first aid supplies, and other non cold-chain. Similar commentary on FourKites/P44 based on lack of pharma focus.

Integrated Logistics Services (ILS). Set up as separate business unit in 2011 to act as 3PL provider

InteLogix. ML platform for pharmacies to address supply chain challenges. Partnership with Palantir.

McKesson

InspiroGene. Tailored 3PL services, specialty distribution networks, specialty pharmacy services (reimbursement), and patient services (call center).  Partnered with Vertex on CASGEVY (CRISPR tx for sickle cell)

Transvoyant. Virtual logistics control tower and middleware for all data transmissions

Cencora

RTLM (Controlant). World Courier is pairing their existing transport and inventory management systems spanning the company’s global network with Controlant’s tech solution - real-time location management (RTLM).

GTM. Heavily consolidated as the big 3 control 90%. Distribution and logistics are these players core business so the nuance and ROI vs. current solutions is distinct vs. other players mentioned here (CDMOs, CROs). It seems there’s an angle to break into a certain business line (McKesson InspiroGene) or provider type (health system, oncology, etc) as an initial wedge.

### CRO: Smaller biotechs will outsource more to CROs.

Slope Series - $20M @ 60M post.pdf

Market Trends. The increasing complexity and cost of drug development process will continue to drive growth in CRO outsourcing, especially for biotechs with less sophistication and resources (link).

Product.  Randomization and Trial Supply Management (RTSM) and interactive response technology (IRT) systems operate like the electronic point of sales systems in other industries to manage the inventory of product available and automate re-ordering when available stock falls. IRT includes interactive voice/web response systems that track drug allocation and collect data. RTSM builds upon these IRT functionalities to oversee supply chain management and integrate with other systems (electronic data capture = EDC, CTMS = clinical trial management systems)

GTM. As shown by the Slope pitch deck, the average slope contract per study is $628K (studies 2-3 years)for early phase I studies for small biotechs. Slope does not do any cold-chain today and has also been pulled into conversations with CDMOs but has decided to stay focused on clinical trials. Slope integrates with different technology systems at sites (mentioned above) to drive GTM.

Notes - Olivier 12/26/24

CDMOs

1200 total Cos

“Specialized”

Focused on a special type of drug (injectables, etc…)

Difference in capabilities - e.g. Cell & Genes, 20+ steps

Open question → what does logistics look like at specialized CDMO?

Small team?

Break CDMO into 3 categories - scale, focus, specialized

CDMO will usually manufacture

Might outsource packaging

CRO do pre-clinical, clinical trial

CRO behavior will vary by size

IQVIA, ICON plc, Fortrea are big players who might do more than just outsourcing

Lexitas is niche player in ophthalmology so makes sense on outsourcing to CDMOs

Hybrid CRO / CDMO (Charles River lab)

Health systems mid size

Potential good targets, lots of couriers

Virtue LP – Tampa general hospital, Mental care hospitals

Oncology is interesting angle here with patient care being admisntered at home

GC invested in Clarium

Optimal surgical planning

Procurement supply

Next step

Get connected to specialized CDMO

Virtue LPs Health systems

Send customer facing blurb

Virtue helps with senior exec from CDMO as advisor

Q&A 12/26/24

How does a CDMO currently manage shipments? Sensors?

Need to confirm in more conversations but thinking a general pitch could be "You track everything to the most granular level in the manufacturing plant...why not do the same for logistics/shipping of finished goods ?"

CDMOs use a wide array of sensors (more below)- process analytical technology sensors (PAT) to monitor attributes during mfg. container closure integrity (CCIT) sensors (detects leaks in vial), and environmental monitoring sensors (humidity within clean rooms and in storage). Some specific examples...

Environmental monitoring sensors - Vaisala HUMICAP for temp and humidity, Setra 264 for differential pressure, Beckman MET ONE 3400 for air particle counters

Automated sensor systems - automated vision inspection systems (Seidenader), automated leak detection systems (INFICON T-guard)

What tools do they use?

Does 1,2001 sound like the right number of CDMOs in the market?

Yes if you break them down into "scale" "focused" and "specialized" as this report does, I'd say 1000+. The long-tail of CDMOs that are popping up are hard to estimate but it's closer to 1000 than 500.

Is there a big difference between ENT CDMO (McKesson) and a SMB CDMO?

Yes, in terms of their capabilities and ZL pitch. For large, integrated CDMOs, they are a one-stop shop for pharma. In order to work with many specialized CDMOs (different dosage forms, modalities, etc), pharma balances more complexity in integrating these bespoke pieces for value of specialization.

How does a CDMO purchase a software solution? How involved is procurement?

CDMOs (and CROs) can buy tech (ERP for example) that improve their internal operations or have pass-through costs where they mark up the cost of tech to their pharma sponsors. Need to determine how this is done for logistics with CDMOs because more familar with how CROs think about this for clinical trial tech

What is the most critical pain point?

What is the average value of a shipment? More like ENT Pharma or SMB/MM Biotech?

Depends on modality and where they are in the chain. The active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) is bulk of COGS to make a finished product, while formulation and packaging is less. A biologics CDMO will have higher value shipments than a small molecule focussed CDMO

Are loss reduction and headcount savings the right ROI examples?

At a high-level (esp. for specialized CDMOs), better logistics / supply chain is differentiator to win contracts. Outsourcing is complex and time consuming task for biopharma, and CDMOs who can simplify that can differentiate themselves in addition to their core offerings.

To be more specific, lost product is pain point similar to biopharma but also timely delivery of raw materials to ensure overall equipment effectiveness (OEE), managing finished good (FG) inventory (impacting working capital) and OTIF rates (some examples where its 50%).

What about insurance savings or incremental business generated for ROI?

Who controls decision-making and where does handoff occur for logistics needs (next slide)?
