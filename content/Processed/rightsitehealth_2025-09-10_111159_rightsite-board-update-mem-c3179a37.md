## August Overview

August was a mixed month: we had strong performance when calls came in, but lower-than-expected EMS call volume drove a revenue miss.

*   August revenue fell short of the forecast, primarily due to lower-than-expected EMS call volumes in Fort Worth and Grady. Remediation plans are underway now in Fort Worth and Grady, and we will have more definitive results in the next few weeks. We'll also push the remaining 2025 SG&A hires (EMS analyst, data analyst, second biller/coder, practice manager, among others) to 2026 until we have more visibility into the call volume.
*   The Patient Care Cost per Episode was higher because the Care Team was staffed for forecast call volume, which didn't materialize in August. Care Team staffing lags call forecasts by 2–3 months, resulting in more physician expense than the actual calls supported.
*   Diversion (avoided ER) and ambulance avoidance rates remained strong at 82% and 93%, respectively, demonstrating that RightSite delivers when calls come in. The issue was EMS call volume.
*   Payor sales accelerated at BCBS/TX, United, and Aetna. Paul McBride agreed to join as a sales consultant for a six-month, performance-based engagement.
*   eNPS came in at 91, with 100% participation. Our culture remains strong.
*   Our first pilot for the Walk-In service line should see its first patient in Q4, with six more safety net hospital ERs in the pipeline.

## Humana – Volume problem

Humana has told us it does not plan to renew in 2026 because activation volume has been lower than expected. Their threshold for expanding us into Texas and Florida was 1,000 activations. To date, we've delivered about 500 across Georgia and Texas.

The shortfall traces back to a January 2024 decision by investors and management to hold back Georgia EMS volume until we had more case rate contracts in place. When we later reversed course, EMS call volume was slower to ramp up than expected, leaving us short of Humana's target.

We are working with Humana's senior leadership on ways to amend the contract and avoid a lapse that would force a full re-contracting process. They remain interested in deeper integration with CenterWell and in using us to support HEDIS measure capture, which could be part of the path forward.

## Paul McBride – Consultant to accelerate case rate deals

Paul McBride ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/)), a career network and cost-of-care executive and LP at HC9, has joined us for a six-month engagement to accelerate case rate contracts. Most of his compensation is incentive-based, tied to the first case rate payment. He will support key negotiations, analyze network and cost-of-care inputs, and provide advice on payor sales and account management strategies. We're excited he's on board, and the chemistry with Clayton and the rest of the team is good.

## ER Walk-In Service Line - Aiming for Q4 start

ER Walk-In is our first expansion beyond EMS. It creates a new revenue stream, gives us more leverage with payers because we are not obligated to treat patients from non-contracted plans, includes reimbursement for the uninsured, and carries no EMS cost.

We expect to see our first patient at University Health/San Antonio in Q4. The ER pipeline includes Memorial Hermann, Baptist, Christus in Beaumont, Grady, Shands, and Dell Children's.

## EMS Update

August call volume fell short of the forecast in two markets: Fort Worth and Grady.

*   **Fort Worth**: We are only three weeks into our largest implementation (80 calls/day at scale), so it's too early to overreact. Our working diagnosis is: (1) this is the first time we've used call data analysis to select which codes to phase in, and the initial set was too conservative; and (2) go-live coincided with Fort Worth Dispatch integrating the former outsourced MedStar team, merging two call centers, systems, and cultures.
*   **Grady**: Recent utilization data from Grady dispatch showed 911 call-takers were sending us only 1/3 of RightSite-eligible dispatch calls. We shared these findings with Grady Dispatch leadership, who are now implementing mandatory referrals starting mid-September.

*   **Action Plan**: Our August call volume miss is not a demand issue; it's a process issue. In response, we have:
    *   Established a standardized EMS data set
    *   Developed new EMS performance analysis tools
    *   Scheduled receipt of weekly EMS partner data to measure performance and inform our account management strategy
    *   Teams are on-site in both locations

We expect call volumes at both Fort Worth and Grady to improve.

## Care Team Operations Summary

Apart from call volume-related metrics, most Care Team KPIs met plan. Four of the workflow metrics missed plan by 10+%. Mitigation plans are in place. Examples of some operating KPIs are:

**KPI's On Target:**
*   Time to answer
*   Dispatch release
*   Patient satisfaction
*   Insurance accuracy
*   QA'ing episodes

**KPI Outliers (>10% outside goal):**
*   Release time in the field – goal <12 min, currently averaging 14.7 min
*   Follow-up reach rate – goal 75%, currently at 66%
*   Time to doc - goal <3 min, currently averaging 3.9 min
*   Navigator QA call score improvement – goal +15%, only 3 out of 14 navigators have so far achieved this

Full details of Care Team Operational Metrics can be found in “RightSite Operating KPIs 2025 Through Aug.pdf", pages 9-15.

Care Team management continues to improve efficiency without sacrificing quality or experience. Active initiatives include:

*   **ActiveTrack**: real-time measurement of Care Team tasks to improve efficiency.
*   **Prescription and OTC savings**: Brand-to-generic equivalency list now in use.
*   **Follow-up telehealth billing**: Enable billing for all follow-up telehealth encounters.
*   **Embedded RN**: Adding an embedded RN to handle non-telehealth episode tasks like e-prescribing, reducing physician time and cost per episode.
