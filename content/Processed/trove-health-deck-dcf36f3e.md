## Slide 3: Executive Summary

*   Trove Health and Oprable, 2 early-stage companies working on the healthcare data access problem, recently joined forces through a merger of equals.
*   Our joint vision is to build "Plaid for healthcare" by making healthcare data accessible and useful to patients, researchers and providers—with the proper authentication, any user can access any healthcare data through any application.

**Key metrics**

| Metric                      | Value                                        | Description                                                      |
| :-------------------------- | :------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **$300,000 ARR**            | Annual recurring revenue                     |                                                                  |
| **$3.5M booked**            | ($2.9M pay-for-performance target)           | Signed contracts incl. pay-for-performance patient recruitment revenue. |
| **$24MM pipeline**          | Sales pipeline, including 11 of 20 largest pharma cos. |                                                                  |
| **Raising $3MM**            | on top of $2.8M already raised               | led by Underscore VC.                                            |

## Slide 4: Traction to date

| Metric                 | Value                                                              |
| :--------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Annual Recurring Revenue | **$300K**                                                          |
| Contracted Revenue     | **>$3M** (target, pay-for-performance), $24M in pipeline ($7M provider/$17M life sciences). |
| Product                | **Live for Treatment & Patient Access** (CCDA & FHIR API retrieval), data structuring, web + mobile app |
| Unique Patients        | **>100K** (and over 2 Million total records)                       |

## Slide 5: The problem

Patient data is **siloed, messy, incomplete** and **hard to access**.

*   Hard for patients to get access to their own data across providers.
*   Hard for life sciences and providers to get access to quality patient data.

## Slide 6: Trove is Plaid for healthcare

With proper authentication, **any user** (patient, provider, life sciences) can access **any healthcare data**, in real-time, through **any application**.

What this requires is high-quality, structured, identified data and user-friendly workflows.

We're a data access SaaS platform for providers, pharma, and patients.

*   **Identified Treatment & Patient Access data feeds.**
    *   Via API, embeddable web app, and mobile app UI for enterprise clients and patients.
*   **Data standardization, structuring, and enhancement.**
    *   Including free text structuring, de-duplication, labeling and filling of missing variables, and annotation – via machine learning.
*   **Custom patient data acquisition campaigns.**
    *   White-labeled technology for patient data retrieval.

## Slide 7: Differentiation: Value for Providers

*   **Unmatched access to quality, searchable, complete patient data in a user-friendly format. It's Google versus ctrl+F.**
    *   ML Trained over years, and on patient documents from >5k healthcare organizations, automatically parses and structures human and machine-readable documents (CCDA and FHIR). This gives rich data, metadata & robust search functionality unavailable on any other platform, while providing visibility into nuances of patient histories missing from FHIR-only and integration engines.
*   **Exceptional speed and scalability:** go live in days and retrieve **millions of records in hours rather than months** by leveraging Health Information Network (HIN) infrastructure and AWS-based ML to ingest, parse, structure and enrich large CCDA datasets.
*   **95% Reduced cost and admin time spent** retrieving, structuring, and reviewing patient data with structured patient histories.
*   **Longitudinal histories of patients** across high-priority use-cases: including patient intake/chart review, patient risk stratification for reimbursement, and care coordination.

## Slide 8: Differentiation: Value for Patients

*   **Free access to all health data in one place, across providers.**
*   **Opportunity to get paid for sharing health information with medical researchers.**
*   **Control over how data is accessed and sold by third parties via configurable consents, which builds trust.**

## Slide 9: We serve two complementary customer segments

**National Health Info networks** + **Trove ML Model: Data Parsing + Enhancement**

**Segment 1: Providers**
(Telemedicine, Chronic care mgmt, Tech enabled care)

*   Pay Trove to retrieve data and create longitudinal, structured patient histories
*   ACV of $50k - $1M ($1-$5 per patient)
*   Patients become part of identified database (100K patients, target of 1M patients by Q4 2024)

**Trove Identified Patient Database**
(currently 100k patients)

**Segment 2: Life Sciences**
(Clinical Ops and reg affairs)

*   Pay Trove to access our identified patient database (including for clinical trial recruitment)
*   ACV of $3M+, often pay-for-performance contracts ($2k-100K+ per patient)
*   Currently more demand for identified patients/data than we can service

**Priority segment in near term ('23-'24)**

## Slide 10: Segment 1 (Provider): Detail & Use Cases

**Target Provider type**

| Category                                   | A) Fee-for service Primary & Specialty Care Chains (Examples: One Medical, Hinge Health) | B) Value-Based Care Chains (Example: Oak Street Health) | Adjacent segment for further exploration: Regional HIE/ Public health Orgs (Example: CliniSync HIE) |

| **Top Pain Points**                        | *   Record retrieval is expensive ($75-500 per patient) and/or manual                 *   Admin and clinician burden reviewing unstructured records (100s of pages) | *   Low Reimbursement from CMS                             *   Misdiagnosis & overutilization of care *   Unstructured patient data complexity      | *   Unstructured patient data complexity                                                          *   Lack of patient access                                                                        |
| **Trove-enabled Use Cases**                | *   Intake (consolidated structured chart retrieval, EMR Upload)                        *   Referrals and Care Coordination (longitudinal history + review sharing w/ other providers)    | *   Reimbursement: (Patient risk-stratification and flagging) *   Population Health & Analytics: (Enterprise Data consolidation, longitudinal history creation) | *   Consolidation of unstructured data across sources                                             *   Patient access to consolidated records                                                        |
| **Other Sales Qualifying Factors**         | (1) $>3M revenue, multi-location (2) Not large health system / relatively centralized & streamlined buying decisions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

## Slide 11: Customer Testimonials

**-Omar Saleh, CEO of MD Portals**
**>50,000 patients on Trove**

"Trove allows us to access the clinical data of patients located in disparate locations using their connectivity to the national networks.

Their platform also allows us to visualize the data of a given patient and to navigate complex patient clinical data in a searchable form.

Trove provides high scalability and metadata of the clinical documents that other providers not offer. This is one of the main reasons we chose them over other vendors."

**-Franklin Moses, CEO of Virtare**
**>400 Chronic Care patients on Trove**

"Chronic care management requires us to get all the available patient data in one place so that care coordination can be streamlined. Trove allows us to do so with ease.

Their platform standardizes the patient information into a structured format, allowing us to create necessary flags to help our clinical staff manage our patients.

Since our patients also often visit other organizations for care, Trove also helps us upload clinical history to the national networks and comply with TEFCA."

## Slide 12: Market opportunity

**Healthcare Interoperability & data market: >$40B growing at 7% CAGR**

**Significant consolidation & exit opportunities**

*   Flatiron acquired for $2B by Roche (2018)
*   Ciox acquired for $7B by Datavant (2021)
*   Ciitizen acquired for $325M by Invitae (2021)
*   Onerecord acquired by Milliman (2022)
*   HumanAPI acquired by Lexisnexis (2023)

**Why now?**

**TEFCA, a new U.S. Healthcare regulation, is changing the health data landscape.**

*   Makes data retrieval a fraction of the cost, shifts the focus to data quality, structuring, and user-friendliness which have to-date all been poor
*   Health information exchanges are already live for treatment access and will be live late 2023 for Patient Access.
*   Payer and Provider APIs are live for Patient access

In addition, **significant tailwinds exist for the $40B patient data market** (individualized treatments, adoption of risk-sharing) especially in Pharma

## Slide 13: Defensibility

**Technology/IP Moat**

*   **Data structuring and enhancement:** Use of ML model trained over years with over 100 parameters and >99% accuracy to **translate thousands of pages of free text (CCD) into structured data in a user-friendly format in minutes**. Can eventually **build an LLM for healthcare.**
*   **Data acquisition through networks+ frontend:** interface to access structured data through new TEFCA infrastructure in minutes/hours rather than months; access via API or **white-labeled app usable with any level of technical knowledge for rapid adoption.**
*   **Can build at minimal cost:** with top-tier offshore (India) tech talent, CPO co-located with the India team.

**Network Effects (Identified Database)**

*   We get paid by enterprise customers to acquire patients (users) who consent to share their information with our partners. We are upfront about this to **build trust**, which has led to a **<1% opt-out rate**
    *   This gives us access to **identified longitudinal data (100k patients so far) for high dollar-value use cases** (like clinical trial recruitment).
    *   We can also obtain consents from providers to reach patients at the point of care from treatment data
*   **Offer the best patient experience to expand this moat:**
    *   Data access is and always will be free to patients
    *   Patients earn money from sharing their data, creating incentives, strong brand and trust with patients from day 1.

## Slide 14: Future milestones: $3M in Seed funding to get to $4MM in ARR & Series A in 18 months

**Raising $3MM to**
*   Build out product (ML, Frontend)
*   Accelerate G2M (Provider segment)
*   Invest in security (e.g. SOCII, HiTrust)
