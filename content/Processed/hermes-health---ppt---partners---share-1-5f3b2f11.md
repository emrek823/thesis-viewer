## Slide 7: Problem: Limited Demand, High Overhead
Problem: Limited Demand, High Overhead

Serving the Long-Tail of Requestor is Hard
*   **Limited Demand**
    Managing the longtail of Requestors adds admin burden and compliance risk—with little return.
*   **High Tech Burden**
    Most Requestors can't implement your APIs, let alone work across multiple vendors.
*   **Lack of Standardization**
    Every request is different—making intake automation tough and scaling expensive.

**Chart: Record Requests vs. Customers**
This chart shows a long-tail distribution where a small number of customers generate a high volume of record requests, while a large number of customers generate a much smaller volume, illustrating the "limited demand, high overhead" problem for the long tail.
*   The Y-axis represents "Record Requests" (starts high and decreases).
*   The X-axis represents "Customers" (increases from left to right).
*   The curve rapidly drops off, indicating that while there might be many customers, the volume of requests from the majority is low.

## Slide 8: Solution: Hermes Unity Platform
Solution: Hermes Unity Platform

**Hermes Unity Platform**
*   **Unified UI:** Platform and API that enables Requestors to compliantly submit and receive requests for identified data requests.
*   **Unified Partner Integrations:** A robust backend that delivers identified back to Requestors by integrating with Partners.
    *   50 ROI Vendors
    *   500 EHR Vendors
    *   100 RWD Sources

**Diagram: Hermes Unity Platform Architecture**
This diagram illustrates the Hermes Unity Platform, connecting Requestors to various data sources via Hermes Middleware.

*   **Top Layer:** Multiple "Requester" entities
*   **Middle Layer:** "Hermes - Middleware"
*   **Bottom Layer:** Data source categories connected to the middleware:
    *   "ROI Vendors"
    *   "RWD Sources"
    *   "EHR Vendors"
    *   "Clinics"
    Arrows show Requestors submitting requests to Hermes Middleware, which then routes them to the various vendors/sources.

## Slide 9: More Revenue, Less Cost, and Scalable Intake
More Revenue, Less Cost, and Scalable Intake

**Value to Partners**
*   **More Demand: More Revenue**
    Hermes simplifies for Requestors the process of requesting and receiving medical records inducing demand for your data.
*   **No Tech Burden: Less Cost**
    Hermes handles integrations with Requestors so you don't have to manage one-off tech support or maintain multiple custom interfaces.
*   **Scalable Intake: Less Cost**
    Every record request arrives in a single, standardized format via Hermes—regardless of who sent it. That means lower operational cost, faster routing, and simplified scaling.

**Diagram: Hermes Middleware Value Proposition**
This diagram shows how Hermes Middleware connects requestors to various data sources, highlighting the value of consolidation.

*   **Left Side:** Three generic "Requestor" icons.
*   **Center:** "HERMES MIDDLEWARE" box.
*   **Right Side:** Four data source icons:
    *   "ROI Vendor"
    *   "RWD Source"
    *   "+ EHR Vendor"
    *   "Clinics"
    Arrows flow from the Requestors to Hermes Middleware, and then from Hermes Middleware to each of the data sources.

## Slide 13: Network Flywheel Effect
Network Flywheel Effect

**Two-Sided Marketplace**
Hermes Health connects Requestors with Partners creating value for both sides:

*   **Partners Benefit Via:**
    *   Increased Requests from Requestors increasing Partner revenue.
    *   Reduced fulfillment costs by switching Requestors to API submission vs Fax.
*   **Requestors Benefit Via:**
    *   Simplified record submission and delivery increasing, enabling increased demand for more requests.
    *   Improved turnaround times.

**Diagram: Hermes Health Flywheel Effect**
This diagram illustrates a positive feedback loop for the Hermes Health network.

1.  **More Requestors:** Leads to...
2.  **More Record Volume:** Leads to...
3.  **More Vendors Integrate to Capture Volume:** Leads to...
4.  **Faster and Easier Records:** Leads to...
5.  **More Requestors** (completing the loop).

## Slide 17: Hermes Reduces Your Legal Exposure
Hermes Reduces Your Legal Exposure

**Contracting & Liability**
Hermes signs agreements with both the Requestor and the Partner.

*   **Requestors attest that HIPAA Authorization submissions are valid and accurate.**
*   **Partners attest:**
    *   That they have the right to release identified medical data assuming a valid HIPAA Authorization.
    *   That they are releasing the correct data for the patient requested
*   **Hermes Health attests that patient data is securely handled and transmitted to the appropriate party.**

**Diagram: Liability Framework**
This flow diagram shows the attestations and liabilities for Requestor, Hermes Health, and Partner.

1.  **Requestor**
    *   **Attest:** That HIPAA Authorizations are Valid and Accurate
    *   **Holds the Liability:** for Inappropriate Record Submissions
2.  **Hermes Health**
    *   **Attest:** That Patient Data is Secured and transmitted to the appropriate party
    *   **Holds the Liability:** for Inappropriate Record Disclosures (arrow from Hermes Health to this box)
3.  **Partner**
    *   **Attest:** That Records released are for the patient requested
    *   **Holds the Liability:** for Inappropriate Disclosure

## Slide 18: Solution: How it Works
Solution: How it Works

**First Neutral API for Identified Health Data**
The Hermes Health Unity Platform connects Requestors to a growing network of Partners—including ROI vendors, EHR systems, and RWD providers. How it works:

*   **Secure Intake:** Requestors securely submit patient’s full name, date of birth, and a signed HIPAA Authorization form.
*   **Smart Routing:** The Unity Platform then routes these requests to our network of Partners.
*   **Partner Fulfillment:** Our Partner networks processes these Requests and securely transmits identified patient data back to the Unity Platform.
*   **Delivery:** The Unity Platform securely delivers the data back to requestors without revealing Partner-specific infrastructure or exposing individual Partner details, protecting privacy, and confidentiality
*   **Transparent Pricing:** Each Partner is paid a clear, per-record fee to keep pricing simple and aligned.

**Diagram: Hermes Health Unity Platform Flow**
This diagram illustrates the operational flow of the Hermes Health Unity Platform.

*   **Requestor** submits to **Secure Intake** and receives from **Secure Delivery**.
*   **Secure Intake** and **Secure Delivery** connect to **Unity Platform**.
*   **Unity Platform** connects to **Partner Route Engine**.
*   **Partner Route Engine** routes to **Partner (ROI, EHR, or RWD)**.
*   **Partner** interacts with **Facility**.
*   **Partner** sends **Patient Data Retrived** back to the **Unity Platform** (via Partner Fulfillment).
*   **Unity Platform** sends **API Delivery** (which contains Patient Data) back to the **Requestor**.
*   **Patient Data** is shown flowing from Unity Platform (via API Delivery) and Patient Data Retrived (from Partner)
    *   A line connects "Unity Platform" to "API Delivery", and "API Delivery" to "Patient Data".
    *   A line connects "Partner" to "Patient Data Retrived", and "Patient Data Retrived" to "Patient Data".
