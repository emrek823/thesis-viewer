### Team Backgrounds

- Andy Charbonneau
	- DC background, technical family (all PhDs)
	- Princeton undergrad with Ayushi, known her 8-9 years
	- Wrapping up physics/AI PhD at Caltech focused on large scale infrastructure for climate models
	- Built end-to-end pipelines across quantum computation, machine learning, astrophysics
	- “Accidentally getting a data wrangling PhD” through translation across different domains
- Sean Doolan
	- 8 years investing in healthcare/biotech
	- Partner at Virtue VC, Fund 2 with $100M+ under management
	- Check sizes: $0.5M-2.5M initial, ability to double down with $5-10M
	- Previous investments include Centaur Labs (early YC batch, May 2019)
	- LPs include hospitals, health systems, insurers for introductions

### Current Healthcare Data Problems

- Existing player limitations
	- Doctor screens filled with graveyard of unused third-party tools
	- Each new need diagnosed as different stream, starting from scratch
	- First 3 months always data cleaning and engineering using same tools
	- Cost of delay much more significant in healthcare domain
- Horizontal players approach flaws
	- Focus on data labels as valuable piece vs. context and logical connections
	- Still thinking about data as side mission, hire guy approach
	- Money wasted on baseline fundamental architecture pieces
	- Don’t understand healthcare-specific biases and uncertainty needs

### Turmerik’s Technical Differentiation

- Auto-labeling with uncertainty quantification
	- Multiple labelers per data piece vs. Scale’s single labeler approach
	- Example: 5 doctors rating transplant eligibility (100%, 100%, 100%, 70%, 100%)
	- System tracks if 70% is legitimate concern or doctor bias (never labels above 70%)
	- Individual labeler profiles and institution-level bias correction
- Workflow integration advantages
	- Changes labeling task to validation task for speed
	- Doctors can complete in 3 minutes between patients vs. blocking time
	- Gets background data for synthetic data pipeline
	- Feedback loop tunes automated labeler to delta level, phases out expert validation
- Infrastructure already built
	- Have ingestion, synthetic data pieces technically ready
	- Money needed to connect pieces into scalable feedback loop
	- Minimal engineering work: 4 deployment engineers, 1 full-stack engineer over 6 months

### Business Strategy & Fundraising

- Go-to-market approach
	- Started with annotation because “huge hair on fire need” customers pay for now
	- Quality and healthcare-specific approach sets apart from competitors
	- Post-raise focus: data infrastructure products vs. project-based labeling
- Data brokerage expansion
	- Mount Sinai partnership as anchor for branding credibility
	- International hospitals willing to join network
	- Enterprise licensing model: $2-3M for claims data reference (Komodo pricing)
	- Land and expand: annotation projects → data licenses for bigger contracts
- Current fundraising status
	- Raising $2M, have term sheet
	- Running real process to find healthcare-focused partner
	- Timeline: wrap up by end of week, decide over weekend
	- Use of funds: team hiring to build out infrastructure
