High Cost Burden
Autism represents a cost burden over $7 trillion across 2.1 million individuals and $3.5 million lifetime costs.

Autism prevalence has grown by 10% annually for the last 50 years (1)

**Autism Prevalence Data (from chart)**

| Surveillance Year | Prevalence | Notes                   |
| :---------------- | :--------- | :---------------------- |
| 1970              | 1:10,000   |                         |

## Slide 4: 1 Delays in Care

The first driver of significant cost is the structural challenges that have resulted in substantial delays in care, deteriorating outcomes.

**Care Pathway Flow:**

*   Family meets with pediatrician during child's wellness visit
    *   (Cross mark)
*   Pediatrician makes referral to subspecialist
    *   *Developmental pediatrician wait times are 5+ months (2)*
    *   (Cross mark)
*   Subspecialist makes referral to ABA center
    *   (Cross mark)
*   Child intake at ABA center
    *   *ABA center wait times are an additional 5+ months (3)*

Pediatricians are not trained to diagnose autism during 15-minute well visit, leading to only 20% of children being diagnosed by age 3 (1)

## Slide 5: 2 Low-Quality Care

The second driver of cost is the primary model of care for autistic kids, Applied Behavior Analysis ("ABA"), is ineffective.

| Challenges in ABA                         | Consequences of Traditional ABA                                                                                                                              |
| :---------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Highly Structured, Rigid Programs         | Skills learned in highly structured, artificial settings do not transfer well to real-life situations                                                        |
| Focus on Rote Learning                    | The repetitive and structured nature of DTT can lead to decreased motivation and engagement, especially if the activities do not align with the child's interests |
| Focus on Compliance and Behavior Modification | Emphasis on compliance can overlook the child's autonomy and can be perceived as prioritizing conformity over personal growth                                 |
| Intensity and Duration of Therapy         | Intensive sessions can be developmentally inappropriate, causing stress and reducing the effectiveness of the therapy for young children                       |
| Minimal Parent Involvement                | Traditional ABA has less emphasis on parent training, limiting the reinforcement of skills outside therapy sessions                                          |
| Fragmented care                           | Traditional ABA can operate in silos, with little communication between behavioral, speech, and occupational therapies, limiting overall effectiveness.       |

## Slide 6: 3 Fragmented Care

Thirdly, a major source of cost is the fragmentation of care, leading to gaps in care and poor outcomes.

**Fragmented Care Flow:**

*   **Patient** connects to:
    *   **Teacher**
    *   **Developmental Pediatrician**
    *   **Speech Language Pathologist**
    *   **Pediatrician**
    *   **Occupational Therapist**
*   **Teacher** connects to:
    *   **Developmental Pediatrician**
    *   **Behavioral Health Therapist**
*   **Developmental Pediatrician** connects to:
    *   **ABA Center**
*   **Pediatrician** connects to:
    *   **Behavioral Health Therapist**
*   **Behavioral Health Therapist** connects to:
    *   **ABA Center**

## Slide 9: 1 Technology-Enabled Multi-Specialty Care

ANNA's Naturalistic Developmental Behavioral Interventions ("NDBI") enables the multi-specialty model, the value-based bundle, and the MSO.

| Challenges in ABA                         | Consequences of Traditional ABA                                                                                                                              | NDBI Solutions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| :---------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Highly Structured, Rigid Programs         | Skills learned in highly structured, artificial settings do not transfer well to real-life situations                                                        | NDBI employs flexible, child-led approaches that embed learning opportunities within natural routines and interactions, making skills more likely to transfer to real-life situations.                                                                 |
| Focus on Rote Learning                    | The repetitive and structured nature of DTT can lead to decreased motivation and engagement, especially if the activities do not align with the child's interests | NDBI emphasizes engaging, meaningful activities that align with the child's interests, promoting intrinsic motivation and deeper learning.                                                                                                                   |
| Focus on Compliance and Behavior Modification | Emphasis on compliance can overlook the child's autonomy and can be perceived as prioritizing conformity over personal growth                                 | NDBI respects the child's autonomy by focusing on natural contingencies and developmental principles, promoting personal growth over mere compliance.                                                                                                        |
| Intensity and Duration of Therapy         | Intensive sessions can be developmentally inappropriate, causing stress and reducing the effectiveness of the therapy for young children                       | NDBI offers developmentally appropriate, play-based interactions that reduce stress and are more suitable for young children, ensuring effective and enjoyable therapy sessions.                                                                           |
| Minimal Parent Involvement                | Traditional ABA has less emphasis on parent training, limiting the reinforcement of skills outside therapy sessions                                          | NDBI involves parents as active partners in the therapeutic process, providing training and support to reinforce skills in everyday contexts, enhancing generalization and family empowerment.                                                               |
| Fragmented care                           | Traditional ABA can operate in silos, with little communication between behavioral, speech, and occupational therapies, limiting overall effectiveness.       | NDBI promotes integrated care by fostering collaboration between behavioral, speech, and occupational therapies, ensuring a holistic approach that addresses the child's overall development.                                                              |

## Slide 10: 1 Technology-Enabled Multi-Specialty Care

ANNA is building technological infrastructure to support AI-driven point-of-care recommendations via integrated EMR and diagnostic progression data.

**Multi-Specialty Care & Data Flow:**

*   **Multi-Specialty Care Inputs:**
    *   Speech Language Pathology (connects to Electronic Health Record - 1)
    *   Occupational Therapy (connects to Electronic Health Record - 1, and NDBI and Interval-Based Data Collection - 2)
    *   Diagnostic Evaluations (connects to Electronic Health Record - 1)
*   **Core Systems:**
    *   Electronic Health Record (receives data from Multi-Specialty Care - 1; feeds into NDBI and Interval-Based Data Collection - 1)
    *   NDBI and Interval-Based Data Collection (receives data from Electronic Health Record - 1, and Occupational Therapy - 2; feeds into AI Data Model - 4)
    *   AI Data Model (receives data from Electronic Health Record - 3, and NDBI and Interval-Based Data Collection - 4; provides recommendations - 4)

**Commentary:**

1.  Coordinated multi-specialty clinical model interventions are collected in EHR
2.  Diagnostic and 6-month re-diagnostic tracks progress on DSM-5 diagnostic characteristics of autism (social communication)
3.  AI-driven data model trains on comprehensive EHR data combining multi-specialty interventions with diagnostic progression
4.  AI data model utilizes data to inform point-of-care recommendations to improve quality of care delivery

## Slide 11: 1 Technology-Enabled Multi-Specialty Care

## Slide 25: Further Empirical Evidence for NDBI

Further Empirical Evidence for NDBI
In a Randomly Controlled Trial (RCT), the Early Start Denver Model (ESDM), a popular NDBI, demonstrated improved outcomes in IQ, adaptive behavior, and diagnostic status with a significant reduction in diagnosis classification and adaptive growth in parallel with typically developing children.

**Commentary:**

*   After 2 years, children provided with the ESDM showed significant improvements in IQ, adaptive behavior, and diagnostic status compared with children who received community interventions.
*   At year 2, the ESDM group improved 17.6 standard score points compared with 7.0 points in the comparison group relative to baseline, demonstrating gains through ESDM are sustainable over time
*   71% of the children in the group that received community-based intervention retained their diagnosis of autistic disorder over the 2-year period, only 56% of children in the ESDM group did so.
*   The ESDM group not only showed improvements adaptive behavior—communication, social skills, and practical self-care—but maintained their growth rate in adaptive behaviors parallel to a normative sample of typically developing children
