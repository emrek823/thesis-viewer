        *   **User:** "What are the key drivers of wRVU productivity for our Cardiology group in Q3?"
        *   **Translucent:** "For your Cardiology group in Q3, the key drivers of wRVU productivity were: 1. Physician Staffing Levels: A 10% increase in FTEs contributed to a 7% rise in total wRVUs. 2. Patient Volume: We observed a 12% increase in new patient visits, directly impacting the number of procedures performed. 3. Coding Optimization: A recent initiative improved coding accuracy, leading to a 5% capture increase in wRVUs for existing services. 4. Referral Patterns: Stronger partnerships with primary care physicians resulted in a 15% growth in cardiology referrals. These factors combined to create a robust Q3 for your Cardiology group."

## Slide 9: Value to working with us vs. building internally

# Value to working with us vs. building internally

### There are a few things that make our AI special and easy-to-use...

*   **Data Model**
    *   We build the translation layer for AI to easily work with your data, so you don't have to
    *   *Example: Significant manual effort to connect ChatGPT to you underlying Financial Data in a way that it knows how to read and analyze it like a P&L (i.e., general ledger data)*
*   **Business Logic**
    *   We train our AI on your business logic, LLMs don't know the right rules to follow
    *   *Example: ChatGPT doesn't know how an organization specifically calculates wRVUs*
*   **Performance**
    *   We run significant evaluation on AI outputs and test / select the best models
    *   *Example: ChatGPT may not be as effective at answering physician productivity questions as Gemini*
*   **Functionality**
    *   We're building beyond chat to support report automation, dashboards, and more
    *   *Example: ChatGPT has one form-factor, chat-based interactions. It is not able to easily manage and maintain complex automated reports, show consistent dashboards. It's not build for this workflow.*
