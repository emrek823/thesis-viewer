### Background & Research Experience

- Conducted research on exercise effects on brain function
- Worked with diverse subjects: healthy people and athletes
- Spent 5 days conducting tests at NIH Clinical Metabolic Research Unit
- Used indirect calorimeter to measure energy expenditure responses to:
	- Cold vs. warm conditions
	- Exercise interventions
	- Sleep patterns
	- Drug responses
- Kinesiology major and personal trainer background
- 3 years at NIH lab conducting comprehensive metabolic testing

### Scientific Journey & Commercial Transition

- Key question: “What does it mean to go bench to bedside?”
- Realized commercialization necessary to impact patients
- Joined Yale Ventures tech transfer office
- Expanded into startup/VC world through Canaan
- Applied for psychiatry residency - saw opportunity for breakthrough science impact
- Founded Epiteth Therapeutics:
	- Focused on epigenetics therapy
	- Went through Nucleate Activator program
	- Secured angel funding
- Shifted focus to brain and mental health initiatives

### Current Venture (VO Health)

- Developing urine-based whole skeletal muscle mass test
	- Deployable anywhere (home, gyms, clinics)
	- Simple “pregnancy test stick” format
	- Lab analysis capability

### Technical Advantages

- MRI vs. urine test comparison:
	- Eliminates effort-based variability
	- More reproducible results
	- Higher accessibility
- Validated through hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp
	- Demonstrated insulin sensitivity measurement
	- Strong correlation with early metabolic health markers

### Key Considerations

- Science risk assessment needed
- Patient engagement strategy
- Go-to-market (GTM) approach
- Raising $1.5-2M for 18 months runway
- Planning to deploy muscle mass test and develop second product
- 5 signed letters of interest secured

### Next Steps

- Finalizing fundraising materials
- Beginning targeted investor outreach
- Focusing on strategic healthcare partnerships
- Team expansion to 3 full-time employees
