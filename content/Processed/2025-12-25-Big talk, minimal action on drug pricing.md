# Big talk, minimal action on drug pricing

### The Trump administration offered a limited half-step toward bringing U.S. drug prices in line with Europe and Japan.

Wall Street gave its verdict on the price breaks that leading drug industry executives promised at a White House ceremony with Donald Trump on Friday. The two largest pharmaceutical industry exchange traded funds surged nearly 2% after the announcement. They rose another three-quarters of a percent on Monday.

One trade industry publication headlined its story: “9 drugmakers ink ‘pandering’ drug price deals with Trump.” Biopharma Dive quoted stock analyst Matt Phipps of William Blair: The deal amounted to “another round of pandering on carefully selected drugs,” he said.

In other words, what Trump and Dr. Mehmet Oz unveiled last week was another example of the administration’s *faux* populism. They took a good idea – pegging U.S. drug prices to those paid by other advanced industrial nations – and reduced it to its bare minimum: A pilot project that will minimally affect Americans’ out-of-pocket drug costs; imperceptibly lower overall government drug spending; and barely put a dent in the Big Pharma’s revenue stream.

But let’s give the Trump administration a little bit of credit. If it follows through and approves the rules unveiled Friday, it will establish a precedent that a future administration – one less solicitous of Big Pharma – can expand into a meaningful program.

### Another Trump program with progressive roots

The idea of using foreign drugs prices as a benchmark for U.S. pricing has been around for years. Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent who champions Medicare for All, popularized the idea by staging drug buying trips to Canada for his constituents.

The first Trump administration in its waning months proposed a comprehensive rule that would have applied what became known as international reference pricing for all of Medicare. It was later invalidated by the courts, not because it was illegal or unconstitutional, but because the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services failed to follow the proper procedure for rulemaking.

The pharmaceutical industry has always been adamantly opposed to international reference pricing. Its trade groups claim foreign countries are free-riding on innovations funded by the high prices paid by Americans. They threaten innovation will dry up if prices in the U.S. are reduced to international levels. European and some east Asian countries like Japan and South Korea counter by arguing their systems use independent analyses of the medical value of drugs as a basis for either imposing or negotiating significantly lower prices.

The “innovation will dry up” claim (debunked in my 2004 book, “The $800 Million Pill,”) is a wearisome red herring dragged out by Big Pharma every time policymakers threaten to lower industry profit margins by making drugs more affordable. The industry remains among the most profitable in the U.S., a distinction it has maintained for many decades. Moreover, most of its newest products like targeted, cell and gene therapies are priced at hundreds of thousands of dollars a year despite having been developed with significant government funding.

The prices drug companies set for their new products have no relationship to the money spent on research and development. They charge whatever the market will bear. When the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act inaugurated Medicare drug price negotiations on a handful of drugs (15 for this year, another 10 next year), the Congressional Budget Office concluded it would prevent a grand total of two drugs from coming to market over the next decade. The Food and Drug Administration approves anywhere from 35 to 50 news drugs every year.

### Read the fine print

The fine print in the two draft rules published last week (one for Part B drugs administered in medical settings and one for Part D plans for drugs sold at retail pharmacies) helps explain why nine industry executives were willing to show up at the White House for their unveiling. The Guarding U.S. Medicare Against Rising Drug Costs (GUARD) Part D rule will only affect about 25% of beneficiaries in the fee-for-service program, which is now less than half of all beneficiaries.

It excludes all drugs undergoing price negotiations (thus excluding many of the priciest drugs Medicare buys); all generics and biosimilars (many of which are very high-priced by international standards); and drugs with low overall spending (which could exclude many rare disease drugs that are very high priced but have very few patients). The proposal also lets CMS determine which areas of the country will be chosen for the model; and gives drug companies the right to submit their own data for the prices they are paid abroad. CMS will no doubt be besieged by industry lobbyists to use their data rather than CMS staff analysis to determine what the benchmark international price should be for each drug .

Given those restrictions, it is not surprising that the projected reduction in out-of-pocket plans and drug costs for Medicare beneficiaries over the five-year life of the GUARD program is only $13.6 billion. Federal costs will drop by about $14.1 billion. Given that Medicare spent $276 billion on Part D premium subsidies in 2023, a total that grows by about 9-10% a year, the total projected savings over the life of the program will cover less than a year’s worth of projected price increases seniors can expect over the next five years beginning in 2027.

The same math applies to the Global Benchmark for Efficient Drug Pricing (GLOBE) model, which will apply international reference pricing to Part B drugs, which are administered in physician offices and clinics. The proposed rule estimates this will save $11.9 billion over five years. Given that CMS spent $54 billion on Part B drugs in 2023 and it is rising at rates every faster than Part D drugs, the savings from GLOBE will amount to less than a fifth of projected spending increases over the next half decade.

Medicaid programs will also be eligible for international reference pricing. Analysts point out that state Medicaid programs already pay the lowest prices for drugs and may see limited benefits from the program.

### Buying into the TrumpRx brand

The nine industry executives at the White House also announced price decreases for some of their drugs, but only if purchased directly from the companies. TrumpRx, a government-created website, will channel consumers to company websites to take advantage of the program. While that cuts out the pharmacy benefit manager middlemen, it leaves consumers on the hook for the full, albeit lower, price of the drugs.

“When 47% of Americans are concerned they won’t be able to afford a health care cost next year, steps to reduce drug prices for patients are welcomed,” said Merith Basey, CEO of Patients for Affordable Drugs Now. “But voluntary agreements with drug companies — especially when key details remain undisclosed — are no substitute for durable, system-wide reforms.”

The same can be said about the next-to-nothing burger contained in the two new proposed rules. Should they be fully deployed, they will at best take a half-step toward bringing U.S. drugs prices in line with the more rational drug pricing systems used abroad.
