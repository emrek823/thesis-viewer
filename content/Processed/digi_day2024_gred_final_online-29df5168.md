The first NeuroMap encompassing genome-wide CRISPR KOs augmented with disease-associated perturbations

**THE ROAD TO THE FIRST NEUROMAP** (Left side: Infographic showing the development process)
*   We began applying phenomics to neuronal data in 2022.
*   → Recursion experiments within the phenomap include:
    *   whole-genome arrayed CRISPR knockouts
    *   genetic perturbation techniques
*   This encompasses:
    *   3528 plates
    *   ~5 million wells
*   We developed protocols to scale generating over **1 trillion** human-induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived neuronal cells.
*   There are **86 billion** neurons in a human brain.
*   We're combining this huge phenomics dataset with Genentech's proprietary data and public information to **discover new insights.**
*   = 100 plates
*   Recursion.

**An example of leveraging the NeuroMap for disease-relevant discoveries** (Right side: Heatmap demonstrating Tau aggregation)
*   **Tau aggregation** (Blue line pointing to top part of the heatmap)
*   (Heatmap showing Gene KO effects, color-coded from Pheno-similar to Pheno-opposite)
    *   Gene KO creates cell state similar to Tau aggregation (Indicated on the right)
    *   Color scale:
        *   Red: Pheno-similar
        *   Blue: Pheno-opposite

**The NeuroMap has revealed:**
*   Numerous neuron-specific perturbation effects and neuron-specific gene/gene relationships
*   A holistic view of neuronal gene functions
*   Insights into cellular states linked to disease variants

**Next Steps:** Explore the map, uncover and validate novel insights and design innovative therapies

## Slide 42: DeepFitness enables small macrocycle discovery - DeepFitness improved binding affinity and diversity of hits

**DeepFitness enables small macrocycle discovery**
DeepFitness improved binding affinity and diversity of hits

**Target: GENE1**

(Left chart: Scatter plot of KD (SPR) vs. Selections)
*   **KD (SPR)** (Y-axis): 10nM to 100uM (log scale)
*   **Selections** (X-axis):
    *   Selection 1: Human Expert (12/41)
    *   Selection 2: Human Expert (2/12)
    *   Selection 3: DeepFitness (15/40)

*   Data points show that DeepFitness (Selection 3) has many hits with lower KD (better affinity), extending into the "Good" and "Awesome" regions, whereas Human Expert selections have higher KDs, primarily in "Very bad" and "Bad" regions.

**Human expert selection 1 (12/41)** (Heatmap table)
*   Shows 12 hits with their KD (µM) values, ranging from 1.41 to >50.

**DeepFitness (15/40)** (Heatmap table)
*   Shows 15 hits with their KD (µM) values, ranging from 0.053 to 1.061.

**Human expert, selection 2 (2/12)** (Heatmap table)
*   Shows 2 hits with their KD (µM) values: 1.95 and 6.4.

**Substantially improving binding and chemical diversity of macrocycle hits**

Key takeaways:
*   Enabling small macrocycle discovery is key for identifying drug-like peptides to enable portfolio transitions
*   Human expert found a family of small macrocycles, but did not pursue it, due to weak affinity (6.4 μM).
*   Best hits (53 nM, 114 nM) “don't show up in the top 100 enrichment hits, I would have never picked those.” – Human expert

**Predictions from AI model enhance decision making**
Super Covariate Adjustment to obtain a better treatment effect estimate

*   The GA growth rate is the primary endpoint in GA clinical trials
*   Efficacy is assessed as the mean difference in lesion growth between treatment arms
*   AI prediction removes explained variability in the outcome to **more precisely estimate treatment effect**

(Left chart: Scatter plot of Y observed vs. Control/Treatment groups)
*   **Y observed** (Y-axis)
*   **Control Treatment** (X-axis)
    *   Shows overlapping distributions for Control and Treatment groups.

(Middle chart: Scatter plot of Y observed vs. Y predicted)
*   **Y observed** (Y-axis)
*   **Y predicted** (X-axis)
    *   Shows a positive correlation between observed and predicted outcomes.

(Right chart: Scatter plot of Y observed - Y predicted vs. Control/Treatment groups)
*   **Y observed - Y predicted** (Y-axis)
*   **Control Treatment** (X-axis)
    *   Shows distinct, less overlapping distributions for Control and Treatment groups, indicating clearer separation after adjustment.

If there are imbalances (e.g., patients in the placebo arm were predicted to progress faster) this "**covariate adjustment**" also **removes the imbalance** in the most efficient way.

*   Shows a slight separation, with high dose appearing to have less GA change.

**Mahalo adjusted analysis using deep-learning FAF model** (Middle chart: Line graph of mean GA change)

*   **(Adj.) Mean GA change from BL (+/- SE)** (Y-axis): 0 to 4
*   **Months** (X-axis): 0, 6, 12, 18
*   Lines for:
    *   Sham (Blue)
    *   Low dose (Light blue)
    *   High dose (Dark blue)
*   Shows that after adjustment, the lines for sham, low dose, and high dose are much closer, indicating no significant effect.

**AI model adjustment - High dose** (Right chart: Forest plot of treatment effect)
*   Shows mean difference and 80% CI for:
    *   No adjustment: 20% effect (wider CI)
    *   Adjustment with benchmark: 15% effect (narrower CI)
    *   Adjustment with FAF DL model: 6% effect (narrowest CI, crossing zero, indicating no significant effect)
*   **Favoring treatment Δ treatment-sham (80% CI)** (X-axis): -1.0 to 1.0
