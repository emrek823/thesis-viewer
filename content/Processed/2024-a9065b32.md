Reva (GC) - 12/2/2024

How to break $100K ACV barrier

Here are our thoughts around ACV progression

Based on the value generated (initial ROI estimates of 6x+) we should be able to command close to $150K ACV (i.e. 3x ROI) with SMB/MM Pharma cos. We will test higher price points with every new prospect we meet. While we see ROI benefits just from digitizing manual Ops work, a larger portion of the ROI comes from reducing the % of shipment failures. As such the key is to rapidly be able to demonstrate that our solution saves 20% or more of shipments identified as being “at risk” (20% reference comes from Saad’s time at Airspace). A couple of pilot / case studies backing that number would provide strong backing for $150K+ ACV, while serving SMB/MM Pharma cos.

Controlant & Overhaul have demonstrated that we could get $250k-600k ACV by moving upmarket, and have anchored a $100K+ pricing expectation in the Pharma logistics market.

Also, as we grow the customer base and validate product impact, we plan to experiment with additional upsells around 1) pricing by commodity type (i.e., we’ve observed a large range in value of these commodities from $5k-$100K+ per shipment), 2) automating invoice audits, and 3) add-on insurance products leveraging the data we have on lane / facility / courier performance. We will also increase ACV by expanding into additional business units - large pharma is segmented by product line, so once we prove success in one area, we can replicate it in another within the organization (new sites, regions, etc.).

We’re early and part of the next phase of ZoomLogi is learning about the value that our product can deliver (outcome-oriented with results customers receive on saved shipments, efficiency, and enhanced patient care), and then capturing that value in the form of ACV. These are the types of thoughtful questions and debates that we are looking for in a capital partner.

How we think about ACV generally today

Additional inputs to help determine Pricing for a specific customer, within the ranges indicated above, would be: # of high value shipments, average value per shipment, and current defect rate.

Specific names for initial pilot partners

Goal: Get 2 written confirmed by the end of the year, and 7 by the end of Q1. Still testing which buyer profile / company type has the highest need for our value prop.
