Confidential

## Slide 3: The OnRamp for Identified Health Data

Hermes Health is a neutral middleware platform that simplifies and streamlines access to identified patient health data for non-treatment use cases (legal, insurance, health plans, life sciences)

### Quick Facts

| | |
| :-------------------- | :------------ |
| Founded | March 2025 |
| Team | 4 |
| Monthly Active Users | 46 |
| Customers | 5 |
| Annualized Revenue | $127,000 (Dec \* 12) |
| Site Sonar Volume | 496 (90% Completion) |

### What We Do
**Validate → Discover → Route → Deliver**

**Screenshot: Hermes Console + UI Dashboard**
The dashboard shows various sections: Projects, Patients, Visits, Procedures, Diagnoses, Sites, Record Requests, User, Resources, Billing, Settings, Users, Companies, Scripts.

**Key Metrics from Screenshot:**
*   Projects: 2010
*   Record Requests: 205
*   Unique Patients: 3075 (Based on name and date of birth)

**Status Distribution (for Record Requests):**
*   Completed: 101
*   Processing: 40
*   Pending: 9
*   Need resolution: 32
*   Cancelled: 23

**Status Category Breakdown:**

| Category          | Count | Percentage |
| :---------------- | :---- | :--------- |
| Completed         | 101   | 49%        |
| Processing        | 40    | 20%        |
| Pending           | 9     | 4%         |
| Need resolution   | 32    | 16%        |
| Cancelled         | 23    | 11%        |
| **Total**         | **205** | **100%**     |

## Slide 4: The Problem

Getting a complete medical record is still a 60-day, $100+ manual process with a ~15% failure.

*   **Fragmented**
    Varying channels to get medical records (fax, bespoke requestor portals, and limited APIs).
*   **Laborious**
    $100+ fully-loaded cost per record request (request labor + site fees).
*   **Slow**
    p90 60 days: Fax → follow-up → invoice → resend auth → record retrieved
*   **High Failure Rate**
    Records get rejected about 15% of the time due to wrong facility, missing authorization information, incomplete records
*   **Complicated by Regulations**
    TEFCA/HIEs can only serve treatment data exchange; non-treatment use cases cannot use them.

| Use Case Purpose          | Hermes | TEFCA + HIEs |
| :------------------------ | :----- | :----------- |
| Treatment                 | ❌      | ✅            |
| Legal (PI/Mass Tort)      | ✅      | ❌            |
| Life Insurance Underwriting | ✅      | ❌            |
| Health Plan Ops/Payment   | ✅      | ❌            |
| Clinical Research         | ✅      | ❌            |

## Slide 5: The Market: Non-Treatment Use Cases

145M record requests a year equals a $10B annual spend category begging for disruption.

### Annual Spend

| Customer Type                          | Record Requests | Cost Per Record (Labor + Site Fees) |
| :------------------------------------- | :-------------- | :---------------------------------- |
| Attorneys (Mass Tort and Personal Injury) | 25M             | $100                                |
| Insurance (Life, Disability, Car, Workers) | 15M             | $100                                |
| Government                             | 1M              | $100                                |
| Life Science Companies                 | 4.5M            | $200                                |
| Health Plans                           | 100M            | $50                                 |
| **TOTAL**                              | **145,500,000** |                                     |

*   **TAM:** $10B Non Treatment Use Cases Annual Spend
*   **Focus Today:** $4B Law Firms + Insurance
*   **2026:** $5B Health Plans
*   **2027:** $1B Government + Life Sciences

*Number of Requests per Year \* $100 (Retrieval + Site Fees)*
*× ~20% Hermes Take Rate = $2.5B*

## Slide 6: The Identified Health Data Ecosystem is Vast

## Slide 7: Solution: Hermes Network

Requestors integrate once with Hermes and instantly get compliant access to health data across many sources

### One Network. One Workflow. One API.

*   **Inputs**
    Patient auth + patient identifiers + request type
*   **Hermes Middleware**
    Authorization validation + route optimization
    routing to best source + audit trail
*   **Outputs**
    Record delivered + status + provenance + billing + audit trail
*   **Example**
    Legal case → submit auth to Hermes → facility matched → routed to ROI source → record delivered by ROI → law firm picks it up → customer invoiced

**Diagram:**
*Top Layer (Requestors):* Law Firm, Car Insurance, CRO, Pharma, Health Plan, Life Insurance, Government, Diagnostic Company
*Middle Layer:* Hermes - Middleware
*Bottom Layer (Data Sources):* ROI Vendors, Claims, EHR, Facilities

## Slide 8: From Network → Packaged Solutions

We take our network and then build simple product wedges that compound into a platform as connectivity grows.

| Product Wedge           | Description                                       | Status          |
| :---------------------- | :------------------------------------------------ | :-------------- |
| **Hermes Console + API** | Request and Receive Data                          | Live Today      |
| **Site Sonar**          | Find Facilities Where the Patient has visited     | Live Today      |
| **Patient Histories**   | Find RX, Diagnosis, and Procedures for a Patient | Q1 2026 Launch  |
| **Fast Lane (ROI)**     | Retrieve Full Medical Records                     | Q1 2026 Launch  |
| **Fast Lane (EHR)**     | Retrieve Full Medical Records                     | Q2 2026 Launch  |

## Slide 9: Business Model

We monetize the requestors with simple usage pricing

### Business Model
*   Hermes monetizes the Requestors.
*   Hermes pays the Data Source
*   Gross margin is the spread between what we charge Requestors and what Data Source charge us.
*   Gross Margin expands as our network grows

| Category          | Price             | Gross Margin |
| :---------------- | :---------------- | :----------- |
| Site Sonar        | $15 Per Patient   | 66%          |
| Patient Histories | $50 Per Patient   | 50%          |
| Fast Lane - ROI   | $5 Per Record (+ Facility Fees) | 80%          |
| Fast Lane - EHR   | $50 Per Record    | 50%          |

### Example
Retrieval firm pays us $15,000 a month
1,000 Site Sonar Requests @ $15 each

## Slide 10: Wedge: Site Sonar

Site Sonar solves the first major bottleneck – finding where a patient was treated – it's a major hit

*   **1st Product:** Site Sonar
*   **1st Target Market:** Record Retrieval Companies

### Problem
*   Patients don't remember where they have been treated.

### Medical Canvassing
*   Today the solution is "Medical Canvassing" where they call providers and ask them if the patient has been treated at the facility (seriously).

### Site Sonar
*   Site Sonar uses claims data – returning the locations where patients have been treated in 12 hours with zero manual effort.
    *   90% Hit Rate
    *   76% of all Claims Encounters
    *   2017 to Present

### Record Retrieval Companies
*   Law Firms and Insurance Companies outsource 50% of their request to Record Retrieval companies. The market includes 100+ vendors.
*   High density of requests making them perfect to kick off the network

**Chart: Cumulative Site Sonar Patients**
*   The chart shows patient count growing from near 0 in March to over 700 by Dec 21, 2025.
*   **Dec 21, 2025:**
    *   Total Patients: 717
    *   New this week: +133

## Slide 11: Site Sonar Kills "Medical Canvassing"

Site Sonar cuts facility discovery from 7 days and $425 per patient to ~12 hours and $15 per patient.

### Site Sonar
*   Reduce Turnaround times
*   Less Cost
*   National Coverage
*   Simple User Experience
*   Secure & Compliant

| Metric          | In-House | After Hermes |
| :-------------- | :------- | :----------- |
| Turnaround Time | 4-7 Days | 12 Hours     |
| Labor Time      | 20 Hours | 1 Minute     |
| Cost            | $425     | $15          |
| Coverage        | Regional | National     |
| Completeness    | 10%      | 76%          |

## Slide 12: Customers & Traction

Customers are buying and the pipeline supports a clear land and expand path

*   **Revenue:** $126K Annualized Revenue

### Customers
*   Client Guard
*   PRO SCAN PARTNERS
*   ChartSquad

### Pipeline (69 opportunities)
*   Customers: 5
*   Contracting: 7
*   Proposal: 4
*   Qualified: 25
*   Discovery: 28

**Customer Testimonial (Email from chartsquad.com):**
"What you are building is a massive disruptor that will fill the void FHIR and TEFCA have left. I love it, and I applaud you for it! Navigating the waters ahead, we are IN on helping, Alejandro!"

## Slide 13: AI Automation Replaces Labor

We turn labor driven steps into automated workflows, enabling us to expand margin and scale without labor.

### Hermes AI Native Workflows

*   **HIPAA Checker**
    Analyzes a patient authorization to make sure it meets the minimum criteria
*   **Site Finder**
    Facility lookup tool that matches a given site name and address to existing sites in our database, returning results with confidence scores based on the AI's judgment.
*   **Site Researcher**
    Web research agent that automatically finds and validates a facilities contact information for: Medical Records, Billing, and Imaging/Radiology necessary to route record requests.

| Category        | Human Labor Time | Human Cost | Hermes AI Time | Hermes Cost |
| :-------------- | :--------------- | :--------- | :------------- | :---------- |
| HIPAA Checker   | 10 minutes       | $3         | 1 minute       | $0.15       |
| Site Finder     | 30 minutes       | $6         | 1 minute       | $0.20       |
| Site Researcher | 25 minutes       | $8         | 5 minutes      | $0.80       |

## Slide 14: Security & Compliance

We are handling identified PHI, so we've invested early in controls, audit trails, and SOC2-grade processes.

### Security & Compliance Milestones
*   HIPAA Compliant Platform
*   SOC2 Type I: In Progress (Jan Target)
*   SOC2 Type II: In Progress (June Target)
*   Vanta Trust Center

**Logos:** HIPAA, SOC 2

## Slide 15: Neutrality Is our Superpower

The winning network can't be requestor or a data source centric—only a neutral trusted broker can build a network at scale.

### Why Hermes Wins
Hermes wins because neutrality is the only model where rival data sources and requestors will join. That trust drives connection density, which compounds into a durable network moat

**The Hermes Promise**
*   No front running data sources
*   No selling routing intelligence
*   Honor data source use case rules

### Why Other Networks Have Failed

*   **Health Information Exchanges**
    HIEs ONLY allow treatment use cases and generate little economic value for the EHRs that power them.
*   **The Datasource Centric Network**
    A datasource acts as the default network, creating conflicts by prioritizing its own data in the fulfillment flow.
*   **The Requestor Centric Network**
    A retrieval company acts as the network, but competitors won't join because it exposes their customer lists, and makes their competitor stronger.

## Slide 16: Alternative Identified Health Networks

One connection to Hermes unlocks non-treatment case cases across a fragmented ecosystem

### Alternative Network Axis
*   Treatment vs Non Treatment
*   Partial Footprint vs National Footprint

### Why Hermes Wins
Hermes is the only network that can support non-treatment use cases through one connection that is not owned by a data source or requestor.

**2x2 Matrix: National/Partial Footprint vs. Treatment/Non-Treatment Use Case**

|                       | Treatment Use Case                                          | Non Treatment Use Case                                            |
| :-------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **National Footprint** | pluto, particle, citizen health®, HEALTH® GORILLA            | HERMES HEALTH, Chart Swap (Sold to Ontellus 2019 Owned by Requestor), CLARETO (Sold to MIB 2025 Owned by Requestor) |
| **Partial Footprint**  | carequality, Health., commonwell HEALTH ALLIANCE, SACVALLEY MEDSHARE, WISHIN | Epic, CHANGE HEALTHCARE, mro®, CVS caremark™, Office Ally, verisma, ChartMate, IRON MOUNTAIN®, veradigm. |

## Slide 17: Data Source Traction

We're converting data sources into live rails that enable us to build the product suite

### Network State

**Data Source Logos:**
*   veritas DATA RESEARCH
*   Office Ally
*   WAYSTAR
*   Inovalon
*   sharecare
*   HEALTHMARK GROUP
*   mro™

| Category      | Implementing | Contracting | First Call | Pending |
| :------------ | :----------- | :---------- | :--------- | :------ |
| ROI Vendors   | 3            | 2           | 2          | 2       |
| Claims        | 4            | 4           | 3          | 4       |
| EHR (Require SOC 2) | 0            | 1           | 4          | 10      |
| Imaging       | 0            | 0           | 2          | 5       |

## Slide 18: The Flywheel & MOAT

Scaling the network and volume creates a self-reinforcing flywheel effect deepens the MOAT.

*   **Connection Density**
    Every new datasource reduces the need for customers to build bespoke integrations—and increases our routing success rate.
*   **Neutrality**
    We don't compete with data sources or customers, so adoption compounds across the ecosystem.
*   **Economies of Scale**
    Higher volume → lower datasource fees → lower customer cost → higher volume.
*   **Products Velocity**
    Shared workflow primitives let us ship improvements once and propagate them across every connection.

**Hermes Health Flywheel Effect:**
*   More Data Available To Requestors
*   More Requestors
*   More Record Volume Equals more Revenue to Datasource
*   More to Data Sources join the Network

## Slide 19: Strategic Vision & Goals

The next phase is to use our momentum to scale our network and achieve escape velocity

*   **Phase 1: Relevance (2025)**
    **Prove the Foundation**
    Build a minimum viable network and product to prove requestor demand and data sources interest.
    *We are Here*
*   **Phase 2: Ubiquity (2026)**
    **Scale Network Density**
    Sign up all the data sources to the network creating a network moat.
*   **Phase 3: Scale (2027)**
    **Scale the Volume**
    Use the network to scale request volume and achieve breakout.
*   **Phase 4: Monetize (2028+)**
    **Monetize & Move Up the Stack**
    Use the request volume and network to build verticalized value added solutions.

## Slide 20: Why Now

5 forces are converging to create a one-in-decade window

*   **Neutral Networks Got Acquired**
    Chartswap sold to Ontellus (2019)
    Clareto sold to MIB (2025); both lost neutrality by selling
    A neutral rail does not exist today.
*   **TEFCA Excludes Non-Treatment Use Cases**
    HIE's and TEFCA serve treatment by design. Legal, insurance, life sciences use cases are locked out.
    This was made clear when EPIC came after Particle Health.
*   **Healthcare AI Needs Data**
    Every healthcare AI company is bottlenecked on training data. Identified health data is the scarcest data type at right now.
    For example, OpenAI wants to create a patient wallet but has no way to onboard the patient's records.
*   **AI Automates Labor**
    AI can transform labor into software. For example, authorization validation, facility matching, follow ups, ect...
    Converting labor into software enables us to build a saas business instead of a traditional services business like past networks.
*   **The Shift to Identified Data**
    The de-identified data market is mature and commoditized, prompting data sources to explore monetization for identified health data. Early APIs from Epic, Veradigm, MRO, and others are unlocking programmatic data access.
