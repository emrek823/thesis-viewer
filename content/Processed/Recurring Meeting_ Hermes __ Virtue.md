### Product and Technical Progress

- AWS SOC 2 Type 1 compliance achieved before end of week
- Site Sonar performance dramatically improved from 7 days to under 1 day
	- Major breakthrough with Shaheer’s infrastructure work
	- Now essentially product-market fit threshold
- HIPAA Checker optimized to under 1 minute (required threshold)
- Site Finder also under 1 minute response time
- Records retrieval target: sub-25 days (fourth seed round goal)
	- High confidence in achieving this milestone
	- Partners moving faster than expected
	- Originally projected 0% digitization over 12 months, now expecting 30-50% in first year

### Corporate Development and Team

- Signed David Dorens as advisor (second advisor)
	- Complex negotiation due to Cloretto building similar business for life insurance
	- Required approval from MIB (acquiring company) by positioning as neutral player
- Isaac Roach joining as third advisor (former Databam product lead)
	- 4-5 month courtship process
	- Comfortable with strategy of selling to record retrieval companies
- Team transition from contractors to W2 employees in progress
	- Bruno and Jude confirmed to sign
	- Adler requesting additional equity, discussing with Shaheer
	- Focus on clean cap table structure tied to milestones

### Partnership Strategy and Revenue Pipeline

- Truvetta partnership: verbal MOU commitment secured
	- Cross-referenced their 30 sites with ROI vendors using proprietary API
	- 26 of 30 sites have ROI vendors, 4 do not
	- Truvetta will prioritize approaching the 4 unconnected hospital systems
	- $20/record payment structure: split between Truvetta and provider
	- Pilot with 1-4 hospitals, then network expansion
	- Enables sub-1-day structured EHR data access (unique in market)
- MRO partnership: API access granted
	- First ROI vendor allowing direct record request piping
	- Third-party submission capability (record retrieval companies can submit on behalf of clients)
	- Value prop: cleaner requests through preprocessing, compliance layer, unified dashboards
- EPIC partnership: Site list access and contracting underway
	- $23/record, 3-day turnaround
- Claims vendors progress: Waystar, Office Ally, and Noble in contracting
	- Risk: escalation to CEO level may trigger legal/subpoena concerns
	- Product/commercial teams supportive, but executive approval uncertain

### Go-to-Market and Financials

- Demo activity increasing week-over-week with sub-1-day Site Sonar performance
- Pipeline: 3 companies in contracting (Crescendo/Sam Rose’s company, Exact Image)
- 15 companies in scoping phase (waiting on pilot volume specifications)
- Revenue confidence: 150-250K bookings goal for 2025
- Product-market fit validation by customer segment:
	- ROI vendors (like MRO): Want HIPAA Checker embedding, Site Finder for facility identification
	- Record retrieval companies: Clear demand for HIPAA Checker ($15/record), Site Sonar, Smart Routing
	- Medical claims: Strong signal but depends on record type
- Pricing and margins established:
	- Site Sonar: $5 cost, $15 sell price (66% margin)
	- Smart Routing: ~$2 sell price, 75% margin
	- Medical claims: $5 cost, $25 sell price
	- Manual fax: $40 cost, competitive sell price
	- EHR connections: $8-12 cost, $50 sell price (high margin when direct connected)
- Claims data capabilities demonstrated: ICD-10 codes, procedures, locations, diagnostic implications under 1 hour
	- No identified middleware aggregator exists in claims space
	- Rich payloads enable patient qualification for studies
- Financial status: $840K remaining, 11 months runway
- Decided against taking partner investment
- No fundraising plans until beginning of next year
	- Target raise: $3-5M in January
	- Focus on fair valuation and long-term partnership building
