### Tonic Demo and Product Overview

- AI workflow automation platform targeting business users
- <$1/workflow execution vs $1,000/year traditional subscriptions
- Natural language workflow creation in <10 minutes
- Document processing example: referral extraction, insurance info, human review
- Happy path focus initially - AI adds edge cases and failure states later
- Test run capability before full deployment
- CSV export or webhook integration options

### Technology Architecture - DFA Approach

- Uses Deterministic Finite Automata (DFAs) for workflow structure
- Key advantages over traditional AI agents:
	- Better consistency for repeated tasks (5-20x daily usage)
	- Natural language acceptance for evaluation sets
	- Static analysis capabilities for regression detection
	- Clear state separation vs complex hierarchical models
- Constraining AI to small, discrete tasks improves specificity
- 24-hour eval set testing using past runs for model regression monitoring

### VC Fund Strategy Discussion

- Virtue ahead of 4-year schedule by 2-3 years
- Strong Series A/B markups expected Q4 and Q1
- Three potential paths forward:

### Great Point Ventures Merger Analysis

- GPV has 150M raised, targeting 250M total with healthcare systems/payer relationships
- Would include incubation arm alongside investing
- Abhishek’s perspective: High status but lower expected returns
- 250M fund size makes equivalent multiples “way harder” to achieve
- Incubation component “mostly doomed to failure” without world-class builders
- Recommendation: Take middle path (75-85M) to maintain competitive positioning

### Investor Value Proposition Insights

- Check size capability most important factor
	- Ability to write full round removes fundraising friction
	- 40-50% round coverage still requires additional 2+ weeks of fundraising cycles
- Platform value expectations:
	- Healthcare investor network claims expected but rarely delivered effectively
	- Real value: Actual introductions to health system investment arms
	- Grunt work assistance (data sourcing, financial modeling) highly valued
- Signal Fire model praised for actual sweat equity contribution

### Next Steps

- Sean to consider 20-30M add-on to Fund 2 option
- Potential Tonic pilot discussion for Virtue workflows
- Follow-up on healthcare vertical vs horizontal intelligence thesis
- Abhishek targeting forced launch within 4 months
