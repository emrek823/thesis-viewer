## Slide 3: Vision

We're building a home for care-related conversations.

The perfect support group for everyone, starting with caregivers.

Caregiver (a.k.a informal / family caregiver):
one who provides unpaid medical care or advocacy for others.

## Slide 4: Problem

Caregivers are struggling.

*   **1/2** feel unsupported by their healthcare system
*   **2/3** suffer from mental health concerns
*   **3/4** are socially isolated

Caregivers struggle to connect with others in similar situations.
Currently, they take to existing social platforms - **this is painful.**

## Slide 5: Solution

Comend is the social platform for caregivers

Existing channels are simply not made for
health-related conversations.

We are the **town square, tribe, and matchmaker**
that caregivers are desperately searching for.

With the caregiver population doubling, **every other
Canadian** is expected to become a caregiver in their
lifetime. **Now is the time to create their infrastructure.**
