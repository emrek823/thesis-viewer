## STATEMENT OF WORK

All hc1 users shall receive access to Ryght to securely use generative artificial intelligence for day-to-day use.

In addition, Ryght and hc1 shall work together to deploy into production the Disease Research and Patient Cohort Copilot mostly completed in 2023. hc1 and Ryght will make every effort to deploy in hc1 production within Q2 of 2024 and Ryght shall not invoice for additional services to put this into production.

*   Users shall be able to rapidly classify common disease states, associated lab tests and write code search hc1's database ("Disease Research and Patient Cohort Copilot"). The copilot is intended to allow users to cohort patients in a fraction of the time compared to legacy methods. Authentication and Security changes necessary to embed the copilot securely within hc1 are included.
    *   disease or therapeutic area classification
    *   lab test compendium and logical observation identifiers names and codes (LOINC) identification
    *   SQL generation specific to hc1 schema

Ryght and hc1 shall work together to enhance and deploy additional generative AI use cases on a case by case basis. hc1 and Ryght will agree to commercial terms that take into consideration hc1's business model and Ryght's cost to support usage. Pricing for the Initial use case is agreed as listed in the table above. The hc1 and Ryght teams will agree on the next use case before proceeding with the development and will create and agree upon a project scope and milestone timeline to govern the project. The scope and timeline will define any ongoing development changes that will be implemented by Ryght in support of the use case.

All applications developed on the Service and sold to hc1 customers shall incur base subscription plus usage fees payable to Ryght, which will be agreed on a case by case basis. Ryght will continue to support and develop API's for use in these applications. hc1 and Ryght will work collaboratively to design and develop API's meeting both parties' ongoing needs. Ryght will provide ongoing development support and consultation during the implementation period. hc1 developers shall have access to Ryght's developer platform to build additional generative artificial intelligence I use cases and copilots.

## TERMS AND CONDITIONS

1.  By signing this Order Form or submitting a purchase order or other ordering document to Ryght, Inc. ("Ryght") in connection with this Order Form, Customer hereby orders from Ryght the software and services described in this Order Form and agrees to be bound by the Terms of Service, available here, together with all applicable Additional Terms identified therein. In the event of a conflict between the terms of this Order Form and the Terms of Service, the terms of this Order Form will control.
2.  Fees do not include any taxes, duties, or other governmental charges, all of which are Customer's responsibility.
3.  This Order Form commences as of the Effective Date set forth above and: (a) will remain in effect for the duration of the Initial Subscription Period set forth above; (b) renewal shall occur automatically on the second year anniversary of the Effective Date ("Renewal Date") unless terminated with written notice 30 days or less prior to Renewal Date; and (c) can only be terminated by Customer prior to the Renewal Date if Ryght fails to cure a material breach of this Agreement within 30 days of receiving notice from Customer of such material breach.

Additional terms. The following Section in the Terms of Services are amended as follows:

4.  **Section 4.1 Price**. Ryght reserves the right to determine pricing for the Service. Ryght will make reasonable efforts to keep pricing information published on the Service up to date. We encourage you to check our pricing page periodically for current pricing information. Ryght may change the fees for any feature of the Service, including additional fees or charges, if Ryght gives you notice of changes a minimum of 60 days prior to the Renewal Date; provided, however, that the fees in effect for the Renewal Subscription Period following the Initial Subscription Period are set forth in the table above. In no event will fees or charges increase during the then-current Subscription Period. Ryght, at its sole discretion, may make promotional offers with different features and different pricing to any of Ryght's customers. These promotional offers, unless made to you, will not apply to your offer or the Terms of Service.
5.  **Section 4.3 Subscription Service**. The Service may include certain subscription-based plans with automatically recurring payments for periodic charges ("Subscription Service"). The "Subscription Billing Date" is the date when you purchase your first subscription to the Service. The Subscription Service will begin on the Subscription Billing Date and continue for the subscription period set forth in the Order Form (such period, the "Initial Subscription Period"), and will automatically renew for successive periods of the same duration as the Initial Subscription Period (the Initial Subscription Period and each such renewal period, each a "Subscription Period") unless you cancel the Subscription Service or we terminate it. If you activate a Subscription Service, then you authorize Ryght or its third-party payment processors to periodically charge, on a going-forward basis and until cancellation of the Subscription Service, all accrued sums on or before the payment due date. Unless otherwise agreed to as outlined in an Order Form, your account will be charged automatically on the Subscription Billing Date and thereafter on the renewal date of your Subscription Service for all applicable fees and taxes for the next Subscription Period. You must cancel your Subscription Service before it renews in order to avoid billing of the next periodic Subscription Fee to your account. Ryght or its third-party payment processor will bill the periodic Subscription Fee to the payment method associated with your account or that you otherwise provide to us. You may cancel the Subscription Service by contacting us at hello@ryght.ai. YOUR CANCELLATION MUST BE RECEIVED BEFORE THE RENEWAL DATE IN ORDER TO AVOID CHARGE FOR THE NEXT SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD.
6.  **Section 4.4 Delinquent Accounts**. Ryght may suspend or terminate access to the Service, including fee-based portions of the Service, for any account for which any amount is due but unpaid 30 days after the payment due date that are not disputed in good faith and provided Ryght provides written notice of such delinquency to you 30 days prior to the suspension or termination. In addition to the amount due for the Service, a delinquent account not disputed in good faith will be charged with fees or charges not to exceed 1% per month or the highest amount allowed under law.
7.  **Section 5.1 Limited License**. Subject to your complete and ongoing compliance with the Terms of Service, Ryght grants you, solely for your personal use, a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable (except as provided in this Order Form), non-sublicensable, revocable (in accordance with the terms of this Order Form) license to access and use the Service.
8.  **Section 5.2 License Restrictions**. Except for your right to create derivative works from use and reliance of the Service, you may not: (a) reproduce, distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or create derivative works of the Service; (b) make modifications to the Service; (c) knowingly interfere with or circumvent any feature of the Service, including any security or access control mechanism; or (d) use the Service for any clinical purpose or to diagnose patients.

The visual interfaces, graphics, design, compilation, information, data, computer code (including source code or object code), products, software, services, and all other elements of the Service provided by Ryght ("Materials") are protected by intellectual property and other laws. All Materials included in the Service are the property of Ryght or its third-party licensors. Except as expressly authorized by Ryght pursuant to this Order Form, you may not make use of the Materials. There are no implied licenses in the Terms of Service and Ryght reserves all rights to the Materials not granted expressly in the Terms of Service. Your Content and any derivative works thereof are protected by intellectual property and other laws, and you retain all right, title, and interest to Your Content and such derivative works.
10. **Section 7.1 Third-Party Services and Linked Websites**. Ryght may provide tools through the Service that enable you to export information, including Inputs, to third-party services. By using one of these tools, you hereby authorize Ryght to transfer that information to the applicable third-party service. Third-party services are not under Ryght's control, and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, Ryght is not responsible for any third-party service's use of your exported information, provided that Ryght is responsible for maintaining the privacy and security of Your Content and Input under Ryght's control. The Service may also contain links to third-party websites. Linked websites are not under Ryght's control, and Ryght is not responsible for their content. Please be sure to review the terms of use and privacy policy of any third-party services before you share any Inputs or information with such third-party services. Once sharing occurs, Ryght will have no control over the information that has been shared.
11. **Section 8.2 Limited License Grant to Ryght**.
    (b) Aggregated Data. "Aggregated Data" means any Inputs or Outputs that have been deidentified or aggregated with other data in accordance with 5 C.F.R. §164.514(a)-(c), as the same may be amended or succeeded from time to time, such that the resulting data no longer reasonably identifies you or a specific individual. You acknowledge and agree certain Residuals of Your Content may remain in the code of the Service that cannot be erased. You agree Ryght is free to use the Residuals created from Your Content to (a) create, train, and improve Ryght's algorithms, models, and insights; (b) perform predictive and other analytics; and (c) create and provide Outputs and reports, provided that such Residuals remain governed by Ryght's Confidentiality Obligations, and data protection protocols. Ryght will not provide Your Content or any Aggregated Data derived from Your Content, in raw data form, to any other users or third parties (other than Ryght's service providers engaged in connection with the provision of the Services).

For purposes of this Order Form, "Residuals" means incremental adaptations made to the Service as a result of processing Your Content, but not your Content itself.

12. **Section 11. Modification of Terms**. We may, from time to time, change the Terms of Service. If Ryght makes a change to the Terms of Service, then Ryght will notify you by sending an email to legal@hc1.com: provided, however, (a) that in no event will the Terms of Service change during the then-current Subscription Period and (b) Ryght provides written notice of changes to you 60 days prior to the end of the then-current Subscription Period. The Terms of Service may be amended only by a written agreement signed by authorized representatives of the parties to the Terms of Service.
13. **Section 12.2 Termination**. If you violate any material provision of the Term of Service and do not cure the violation within thirty (30) days of written notice by Ryght, then your authorization to access the Service and the Terms of Service automatically terminate upon the conclusion of the thirty (30) day period.
14. **Section 12.3 Effect of Termination**. Upon termination of the Terms of Service: (a) your license rights will terminate and you must immediately cease all use of the Service; (b) you will no longer be authorized to access your account or the Service; (c) you must pay Ryght any unpaid amount not disputed in good faith that was due prior to termination; (d) Ryght will immediately return or destroy (at your sole option) Your Content; and (e) all payment obligations accrued prior to termination and Sections 5.3 (Feedback), 6 (Ownership; Proprietary Rights), 8.2(b) (Aggregated Data), 12.3 (Effect of Termination), 13 (Indemnity), 14 (Disclaimers; No Warranties by Ryght), 15 (Limitation of Liability), 16 (Dispute Resolution and Arbitration), and 17 (Miscellaneous) will survive. You are solely responsible for retaining copies of any Inputs you Post to the Service since upon termination of your account, you may lose access rights to any Inputs you Posted to the Service. If your account has been terminated for a material breach of the Terms of Service in accordance with Section 12.2, then you are prohibited from creating a new account on the Service using a different name, email address or other forms of account verification.

16. **Section 13. Indemnity**.
    **hc1 Indemnity**.

Neither party may not assign or transfer the Terms of Service or such party's rights under the Terms of Service, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without the other party's prior written consent; provided, however, that either party may assign the Terms of Service and all rights granted under the Terms of Service, at any time to the assigning party's affiliates, or a successor, by way of merger or consolidation or the acquisition of substantially all of the business and/or assets relating to the subject matter of the Terms of Service, without the other party's notice or consent. The failure to require performance of any provision will not affect a party's right to require performance at any other time after that, nor will a waiver by a party of any breach or default of the Terms of Service, or any provision of the Terms of Service, be a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself. Use of Section headers in the Terms of Service is for convenience only and will not have any impact on the interpretation of any provision. Throughout the Terms of Service the use of the word "including" means "including but not limited to." If any part of the Terms of Service is held to be invalid or unenforceable, then the unenforceable part will be given effect to the greatest extent possible, and the remaining parts will remain in full force and effect.

The receiving party shall not use any such Confidential Information for any purpose other than as is necessary to perform its obligations hereunder and shall not disclose any such Confidential Information to any person or entity, except to the receiving party's employees or contractors who have a need to know the Confidential Information for the receiving party to perform its obligations hereunder. On the expiration or termination of the Terms of Service, the receiving party shall promptly return to the disclosing party all copies, whether in written, electronic, or other form or media, of the disclosing party's Confidential Information, or destroy all such copies and certify in writing to the disclosing Party that such Confidential Information has been destroyed. Nothing in the Terms of Service prohibits either party from making disclosures of Confidential Information if required by applicable law, subpoena, or court order, provided (if permitted by law) it notifies the other party in advance and cooperates in any effort to obtain confidential treatment.
