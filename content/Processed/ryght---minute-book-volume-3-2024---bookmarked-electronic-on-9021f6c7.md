# Engagement Letter
## Agreement

This report details the valuation analysis used to derive the fair market value of the common equity of Ryght, Inc. (hereinafter
referred to as the "Company") on a per share basis ("Subject Interest") as of 02/29/2024 ("Valuation Date"). It is understood
that the valuation of the Subject Interest, as developed in this report, will be used for tax planning and financial reporting
purposes in recognition of Internal Revenue Code Section 409A ("IRC § 409A" OR "409A") and FASB Accounting Standards
Codification Topic 718 - Stock Compensation ("ASC 718"). As such, this report should not be used for any other purpose.

The definition of fair market value is predicated on IRS Revenue Ruling 59-60.

## Standard of Value

For income tax purposes, the appropriate standard of value is fair market value ("FMV"), which is defined as: The price,
expressed in terms of cash equivalents, at which such property would change hands between a hypothetical willing and able
buyer and a hypothetical willing and able seller, acting at arm's length in an open and unrestricted market, when neither is
under compulsion to buy or to sell, and when both have reasonable knowledge of relevant facts.

For financial reporting purposes, the appropriate standard of value is fair value ("FV"), which is defined as: The amount at
which an asset (or liability) could be bought (or incurred) or sold (or settled) in a current transaction between willing parties,
that is, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.

According to FASB Accounting Standards Update 2021-07, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Determining
the Current Price of an Underlying Share for Equity-Classified Share-Based Awards ("ASU 2021-07"), private companies
may use a practical expedient to determine the current price input of equity-classified share-based awards by using the
reasonable application of a reasonable valuation method. A practical expedient is "a more cost-effective way of achieving the
same or a similar accounting or reporting objective." According to ASU 2021-07, "a reasonable valuation performed in
accordance with the Treasury Regulations is an example of a way to achieve the practical expedient." As such, it is not
unreasonable that the conclusion of fair market value for tax planning and reporting purposes is applied for fair value
financial reporting purposes.

## Scope of Engagement

This report was created in compliance with Revenue Ruling 59-60 and 409A.

We considered differences between the Company's preferred and common shares, as applicable, with respect to liquidation
preferences, conversion rights, voting rights, and other features. We also considered appropriate adjustments to recognize
lack of marketability and control related to the Subject Interest.

## Scope of Analysis

*   Review of corporate documents including, but not limited to, the capitalization summary of preferred stock ("Preferred
    Stock" or "Preferred Shares"), Common Stock, options and warrants;
*   Analysis of transactions in the Company's stock, considering the nature of the business, its history, its financial
    condition, and its stage of development;
*   Research and analysis concerning comparable private companies and transactions involving comparable private
    companies;
*   Analysis concerning the current economic conditions and outlook for the US economy, as well as applicable global
    economic conditions; and
*   Analysis and estimation of the FMV of the common equity on a non-marketable, minority interest basis as of the
    Valuation Date.

# Analysis Overview
## Benchmarking Methodology Introduction

### Fair Market Value (FMV)¹
**$0.02**
Carta determined the FMV for Ryght, Inc.'s common stock to be $0.02.

### How was this report prepared?

Carta Valuations LLC (Carta) is the leading provider of 409A valuations with over 50,000 valuations
performed. A subset of these are performed on companies that have yet to raise a preferred round of
financing.

Anonymized and aggregated data from these valuations was used to create the benchmarking study
presented here. This study incorporates the results of the analysis of over 9,000 pre-seed and seed²
stage companies.

This report determines a value for Ryght, Inc. and its common shares as of the Valuation Date. The
steps used to determine these values are presented on the following pages.

---
⁴ (1) Fair market value (FMV) represents the current value of one share of Ryght, Inc.'s common stock. This is the recommended strike price for
upcoming option grants.
(2) Carta defines a pre-seed company as one that has yet to raise a priced preferred round of financing. Companies that raised a Series A round of
financing as their first priced round have been excluded from this analysis.

# Analysis Walkthrough (Step 1 of 4)
## Benchmarking Analysis

### Step 1: Calculate multiple on cash raised

The first step in determining a company value for Ryght, Inc. involves the calculation of a multiple on
cash raised for seed stage companies on the Carta platform in the Healthcare Software And Tech
industry. A multiple on cash raised simply divides the company value concluded in each 409A analysis
by the cash that the company has raised since inception, as depicted in the following equation:

**Company Value / Cash Raised = Multiple on Cash Raised**

### Why a multiple on cash raised is important

Calculating a multiple on cash raised allows for a standard unit of measurement for companies that have
and have not raised a preferred round of financing. By calculating a multiple on cash raised for each
seed company in the Healthcare Software And Tech industry, we can start to see what a potential seed
round of financing for Ryght, Inc. might look like.

### Calculating a median multiple

After a multiple on cash raised was concluded for each series seed company in the Healthcare Software
And Tech industry, Carta calculated an average (median) for the peer group with the results listed below:

Median seed multiple on cash raised: **1.59x**

This multiple represents a value that would be relevant to Ryght, Inc. were the Company to be
successful in raising a seed round of financing.

# Analysis Walkthrough (Step 2 of 4)
## Benchmarking Analysis

### Step 2: Calculate probability of success

The probability that Ryght, Inc. will successfully raise a priced preferred round of financing was
calculated using Carta's proprietary machine learning (ML) model. This model learns from Carta's
historical fundraising data and considers traits specific to Ryght, Inc. including age, industry, and cash
raised.

### Inputs in the model

The following factors were used as inputs into Carta's probability of success model:

*   Age (incorporation date through date of valuation)
*   Industry
*   Total cash raised

These factors were found to be most relevant in predicting whether a company will be successful in
raising a seed round of financing. After including the data specific to Ryght, Inc.'s age, industry, and
cash raised, the following probability of success was determined:

### Estimated Probability of a Successful Equity Round
**70.25%**
This probability of success was applied to the median seed stage multiple on
cash raised from Step 1, as outlined on the following page.

carta

# Analysis Walkthrough (Step 3 & 4 of 4)
## Benchmarking Analysis

### Step 3: Determine a company value

After determining a median multiple on cash raised and a probability of success specific to the
Company, Carta combined the two factors to arrive at a pre-seed multiple for Ryght, Inc. of 1.12x. In this
formula, the probability of success is used to directly account for the chance that Ryght, Inc. will not be
successful in raising a priced preferred round of financing.

**Visual Formula/Calculations:**
*   `1.59x Seed multiple` X `70.25% Probability of success` = `1.12x Pre-Seed multiple`
*   `$4.3M Cash raised` X `1.12x Pre-Seed multiple` = `$4.7M Company value`
*   `$4.7M Company value` - `$4.3M Debt¹` = `$496.5K Equity value`

Note: The figures shown in the image above have been rounded for display purposes. Actual
calculations used the unrounded values.

### Step 4: Determine an FMV

This equity value was then allocated across Ryght, Inc.'s capital structure to arrive at the FMV
presented on the next page.

⁷ (1) Debt is defined as any outstanding claims on invested capital such as SAFE notes, debt, convertible notes or founders loans.

# Valuation Summary

### Fair Market Value (FMV)
**$0.02**
Carta determined the FMV for Ryght, Inc.'s common stock to be $0.02.

### Probability of Success
**70.25%**
Based on the benchmarking data summarized in this report, Carta
determined that there is a 70.25% probability that Ryght, Inc. will succeed
in raising a priced round of preferred financing.

## Not representative of your company?

This 70.25% probability of success assumes that Ryght, Inc. has a similar probability of success to other
pre-seed companies considering size and stage of development. If the calculated 70.25% probability of
success does not align with Ryght, Inc.'s current fundraising expectations, please let us know.

Note: Probability of success has a direct impact on the concluded FMV. For example, a higher
probability of success implies that a higher multiple on cash raised for the Company may be appropriate.

# Appendix

# Company Value Determination

The cash Ryght, Inc. has raised since inception was used as the starting point for the company value
determination. A multiple of 1.59x was selected for Ryght, Inc. after considering the median multiple on
cash raised for seed companies in the Healthcare Software And Tech industry and a calculated
probability of success specific to the Company. This multiple was directly applied to the Company's cash
raised to arrive at an overall company value.

Claims on invested capital was subtracted from this company value to arrive at an overall equity value
for the Company. Claims on invested capital can often include repayment obligations such as SAFE
notes, debt, convertible notes or founder loans. The equity value conclusion represents the residual
value that is left for distribution to holders of common shares.

|                       | Cash raised  | Multiple on cash raised | Weighting | Weighted value |
| :-------------------- | :----------- | :---------------------- | :-------- | :------------- |
| Company value         | $4,251,310   | 1.12x                   | 100%      | $4,746,516     |
| Less: claims on invested capital |              |                         |           | $4,250,000     |

# Company Value Allocation

## Capitalization table

| Share class | Shares outstanding | Warrants | Options | Total      |
| :---------- | :----------------- | :------- | :------ | :--------- |
| Common      | 10,600,000         | 0        | 0       | 10,600,000 |
| Total       | 10,600,000         | 0        | 0       | 10,600,000 |

## FMV determination

After deducting Ryght, Inc.'s claims on invested capital and subtracting any residual payments to option
and/or warrant holders, the equity value was allocated across the Company's current number of shares
outstanding to arrive at a fully marketable value per common share.

A discount for lack of marketability (DLOM) of 50.00% was then applied to account for the fact that
Ryght, Inc.'s shares are not as liquid as their public comparable company counterparts. In other words,
one should expect to pay less for a closely-held (private) share of stock than that same investor would
pay for a publicly-traded, fully liquid security.

A fair market value (FMV) of $0.02 was concluded after application of the selected DLOM. The next
page will walk through how Carta arrived at the 50.00% DLOM selection in this analysis.

# DLOM Selection

When selecting a discount for lack of marketability (“DLOM") to be applied to Ryght, Inc.'s common
shares, Carta Valuations LLC relied primarily on put option models. Court case rulings (i.e.
Mandelbaum, et al v. Commissioner Internal Revenue), restricted stock studies, and IPO studies were
also considered to gauge the reasonableness of the put option model results.

Securities-based approaches to computing discount for lack of marketability rely on firmly-established
stock option pricing theory. In compiling this valuation, we considered a stock option pricing model
named the Chaffe Approach. For each volatility selection displayed below, the following table outlines
the appropriate DLOM calculation for a pre-seed company that has no immediate plans for an exit.

| Base Inputs   | Value  |
| :------------ | :----- |
| Time to Exit  | 5 Years |
| Risk Free Rate | 4.26%  |

## The Chaffe Approach - representative DLOMs(1)

| Company Volatility | 60%     | 70%     | 80%     | 90%     | 100%    |
| :----------------- | :------ | :------ | :------ | :------ | :------ |
| Suggested DLOM     | 35.88%  | 41.97%  | 47.57%  | 52.64%  | 57.18%  |

Considering the calculations displayed above as well as Ryght, Inc.'s size and stage of development, a
DLOM of 50.00% was determined to be appropriate for use in this valuation.

# Valuation Methodology Summary

The first step in valuing the Company's common shares was to determine the value of the Company. In
arriving at a conclusion of the Company value, we considered the three broad methodologies below:

## Market approach: Guideline transaction (Benchmarking) method

The Benchmarking method measures the value of the Company through the probability of it successfully
raising a preferred equity financing round in the future. Implied multiples on cash raised from Subject
Company Transaction Methods are discounted according to a probability of success that is specific to
the Company. Given the Company's stage, size, and lack of material progress as of the Valuation Date,
we concluded the value of the Company would be best determined using a Guideline transaction
(Benchmarking) method.

Other market approaches not used: Subject company transaction method, Guideline public company
method, Guideline M&A transaction method.

## Income approach: Discounted cash flow

Carta Valuations LLC reviewed the Company's prior stock transactions and analyzed its financial
condition. Companies at this stage of development are expected to have significant upfront cash burn.
Given the uncertain nature of future cash flows, especially pertaining to the timing of profitability, Carta
Valuations LLC deemed that the financial projections would not produce a reliable indication of value.
Given the uncertain nature of future cash flows, especially pertaining to the timing of profitability, Carta
Valuations LLC deemed that a discounted cash flow analysis would not produce a reliable indication of
value.

## Asset approach

The Asset Approach measures the value of an asset by the cost to recreate or replace it with another of
like utility. When applied to the valuation of equity interests in businesses, value is based on the net
aggregate fair market value of the entity's underlying individual assets. This approach is frequently used
in valuing holding companies or capital-intensive businesses. This methodology was considered and not
used, as it does not accurately represent the going concern value of the Company.

# Safe Harbor for Section 409(A)

IRC § 409(A) specifies that the fair market value (FMV) of private stock is determined by the
"reasonable application of a reasonable valuation method". Section 409(A) also states that there are
three safe harbors for private companies that are presumed to result in a reasonable valuation, provided
that the valuation is not shown to be “grossly unreasonable". This report qualifies for safe harbor under
IRC § 409(A) as a valuation determined by an "independent appraisal that meets the requirements of
section 401(a)(28)(C) and the regulations as of a date that is no more than 12 months before the
relevant transaction to which the valuation is applied."

The IRC provides requirements for independent appraisals in § 401(a)(28)(C), § 170(a)(1), § 170(f)(11)
(E), and § 1.170A-17. A qualified appraisal must be conducted by a qualified appraiser in accordance
with generally accepted appraisal standards. This report was prepared under the guidance of and in
accordance with valuation policy prepared by individuals meeting the IRS definition of qualified
appraiser. This report was prepared in accordance with generally accepted appraisal standards, which
the IRS defines as consistent with the "substance and principles of the Uniform Standards of
Professional Appraisal Practice” (USPAP).

This report is also in compliance with IRS guidance on the valuation of shares of the capital stock of
closely held corporations as described in Revenue Ruling 59-60. Communications with management,
analysis of the company, and analysis of private company data have addressed all relevant factors
indicated in Revenue Ruling 59-60:
