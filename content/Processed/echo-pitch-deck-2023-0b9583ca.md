# Echo Pitch Deck

## Slide 1: Front Page

echo
A digital therapeutic solution for Autism therapy that improves clinical outcomes through parental involvement
+

## Slide 2: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)

echo

### Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)
#### Autism Facts
*   **50% of ALL healthcare costs for kids aged 0 – 10 are related to Autism**
*   **The average cost of ABA therapy is $63,000 per year**
*   **CDC estimates that 1 in 44 children have ASD and this is expected to grow to 1 in 30**
*   **Parental involvement is a critical success factor that improves outcomes**

#### Industry Needs an All-In-One Parental Involvement Solution
*   Parental involvement is a critical success factor that improves outcomes and accelerates therapy fade
*   Less than 10% of families are involved in the therapy of their child
*   Existing solutions in the market are disparate, complicated, and do not actively facilitate parental involvement
*   Solutions in the market are not integrated with provider and health plan systems

#### Health Plans and Providers Need a Seamless Data Exchange
*   Health plans receive thousands of assessments per month via email where the data is not standardized and cannot be reported
*   Health plans struggle to measure care quality and progress over time
*   There are no preferred provider networks as health plans struggle to identify top performing providers
*   Providers see delays in starting care due to paper based assessments

## Slide 3: We've Done This Before

### We've Done This Before
Echo has many similarities to our last venture “Ally” which our same team delivered to a 22x EBIDTA multiple exit

| | Key Similarities and Leverage Points | |
|---|---|---|
| ✅ | Both ventures are healthcare focused and require consolidating a highly fragmented ecosystem, selling to both providers of care and payers simultaneously | ✅ |
| ✅ | Successfully built the first clearinghouse used in long term care insurance, allowing for a seamless data exchange between providers and insurers | ✅ |
| ✅ | Built a best in class all-in-one native mobile app that facilitated involvement between families, clients, and insurers in long term care | ✅ |
| ✅ | Same management team, same software architects, and same technology stack that was used with Ally | ✅ |

## Slide 5: Problem: No Parental Involvement

echo

### Problem:
#### No Parental Involvement

*   Studies show that parental involvement can accelerate therapy fade by 6 - 18 months however **less than 10% of all families are properly trained and involved.**
*   Parents know their child best but their deep and intimate knowledge is often not used in crafting treatment plans.
*   Providers are not able to adequately train families or assign stakeholder goals, and payers have no visibility of goal progress
*   Successful therapy involves being able to smoothly transition skill mastery across multiple locations and environments (facility to home etc.). Parental involvement facilitates this.

## Slide 6: What Are Parents Saying?

echo

### What Are Parents Saying?
#### Parents are frustrated
We've interviewed families with Autistic children to get their feedback. Here are insightful examples of what they are saying:

*   "I want to get involved but don't know how”
*   "I see so many behavioral traits at home that I wish the therapist saw and included in the treatment plan from the start"
*   "We are tracking progress notes on a notepad at home. Sometimes providers might have a Google sheet"
*   “We have switched providers multiple times because they did not help us to get involved at home”

"I want to get involved but don't know how"

## Slide 10: Incentivizing Providers to Engage Parents

### Providers are critical stakeholders to maximize engagement

### Incentivizing Providers to Engage Parents
Parental involvement is critical however it happens less than 10% of the time.
Providers are important to help facilitate parental involvement in therapy. Providers have ongoing touchpoints with family members, and incentivizing providers will increase their involvement with families.

#### Through Echo, providers can maximize their parent training reimbursement.
*   Provider assigns parent goals on Echo
*   Parents complete goals and track notes on Echo mobile app
*   For every goal completed, health plans reimburse provider 2 units of CPT 97156 (parent training)

**Providers can make an extra $100 - $150 per client per month. This is a significant opportunity for providers!**
