## Slide 3: MISSION

MISSION
USE THE GENETICS OF INTEGRATIVE PHYSIOLOGY TO
ELIMINATE TRIAL AND ERROR IN MEDICINE

## Slide 4:

HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE IS THE LEADING PREVENTABLE CAUSE OF DEATH IN THE WORLD

IT COSTS $93 BILLION IN THE U.S. ANNUALLY

IT IS TREATED WITH TRIAL-AND-ERROR

## Slide 5: TREATING HYPERTENSION WITH TRIAL AND ERROR IS INEFFICIENT AND DANGEROUS

-   **PATIENTS RESPOND TO MEDICATIONS DIFFERENTLY**
    Average response rate to each medication is 50%
-   **MANY VISITS ARE REQUIRED**
    Little incentive in a symptomless disease for many trips - particularly for underserved populations.
-   **MEDICATIONS ARE LAYERED, EVEN IF THEY DON'T WORK**
    Each layered medication means a 70% increase in the chance a patient wont take it.
-   **MEDICATIONS HAVE LONG TERM SIDE EFFECTS**
    Patients should not be on ineffective medications for life. Some even cause BP to go up.

## Slide 6: RESULT: DISMAL HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE CONTROL

-   **50%** (represented by 10 light blue male figures out of 20 total) have it under control
-   **40%** (represented by 8 light blue female figures out of 20 total) taking medications as prescribed do not have it under control. They are on the wrong medication.

## Slide 7: HYPERTENSION CAUSES AND SOLUTIONS ARE BASED IN THE GENETICS OF INTEGRATIVE PHYSIOLOGY

-   **GENES CONTROL HOW HARD THE HEART BEATS AND HEART RATE**
    Beta Blockers Are Used to Treat:
    14 Options

-   **GENES CONTROL SODIUM REABSORPTION IN THE KIDNEYS**
    Diuretics Are Used to Treat:
    13 Options

-   **GENES CONTROL VASCULAR CONSTRICTION**
    Vasodilators Are Used to Treat:
    10 Options

## Slide 8: GENETICURE FOR HYPERTENSION

**Geneticure for Hypertension Pharmacogenomic Panel (Laptop Screen Content - Summary)**

-   KIT ID: GCE3496
-   PATIENT ID: (432) 412-4213
-   NAME: user4 PATIENT
-   Do not start or stop taking any medications without first consulting your provider.

**Primary recommendation:**
1.  Non-selective β-blocker, moderate dose (timolol, alprenolol, carvedilol, or propranolol). If co-morbidity for β-blockade, consider Ca++ channel blocker.
2.  If the above recommendation is not effective or appropriate for your patient, consider: Angiotensin-II (AII) receptor blocker
3.  If the above recommendation is not effective or appropriate for your patient, consider: ACE inhibitor
4.  If the above recommendation is not effective or appropriate for your patient, consider: Thiazide or thiazide-like diuretic

**Results Detail:** The patient demonstrates the greatest functionality in the genes that encode receptors that control cardiac function (the β2-adrenergic receptors), and that encode CYP2D6 (which metabolizes some β-blockers). As such, this patient will likely respond well to β-blockade. Specifically, the patient should respond best to a non-selective β-blocker (timolol, alprenolol, carvedilol, or propranolol). If co-morbidity for β-blockade is present a Ca++ channel blocker should be considered. Following this, the patient demonstrates functionality in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, specifically in the ACE gene and the angiotensin-II receptor. Based on the genetic profile, therapy with an angiotensin-II receptor blocker is recommended followed by an ACE inhibitor. The final line of therapy is informed by the patient's functionality in the genes that encode for channels/enzymes important in Na+ reabsorption in the kidney. The genetic profile would suggest responsiveness to a diuretic.

**Key Benefits of Geneticure:**
-   **PROVIDES GENETIC WINDOW TO EACH UNIQUE PATIENT PHYSIOLOGY**
-   **GUIDES DOCTORS TO WHICH MEDICINE(S) ARE MOST LIKELY TO WORK FOR EACH PATIENT**
-   **IMPROVED OUTCOMES**
    *   Fewer Medications
    *   Quicker control
    *   Improved adherence
    *   Lower blood pressure
    *   Lower cost of care

## Slide 13: HEALTH ECONOMICS (PEER REVIEWED AND PUBLISHED): $249 RETAIL

Each population of 1,000 has 188 candidates for the test.
188 tests yields $750,720 in direct healthcare cost savings over 3 years, or $1,331 per patient per year.

### PAYERS
-   47% less expensive vs. standard of care
-   More compliant patients for life
-   **75% Geneticure Gross Margin**

### PROVIDERS
-   Better care and outcomes
-   Millions of new open appointments
-   Higher quality scores
-   **75% Geneticure Gross Margin**

### EMPLOYERS
-   Uncontrolled hypertension is #1 or #2 contributor to healthcare spending.
-   Millions fewer days of missed work
-   **57% Geneticure Gross Margin**
    (Geneticure provides Physician oversight and genetic counseling)

## Slide 14: WE ARE DIFFERENT

### COMPLEX SCIENCE FOR COMPLEX DISEASES
Other genetic tests only show how quickly medications will get into your bloodstream.
This does not influence outcomes in diseases like hypertension.

### EVIDENCE. FIRST.
Other genetic tests are marketed with little or no peer-reviewed data.
Punching above our weight with clinical and economic evidence.

### PATENTS
Drug metabolism and disease marker genetic tests are commodities.
Our combinatorial panels with sophisticated algorithms are protectable.
