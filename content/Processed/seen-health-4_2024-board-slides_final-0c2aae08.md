## Slide 4: On-track towards 1/1/2025 date, but lost significant time and resources
FOUNDER UPDATES
On-track towards 1/1/2025 date, but lost significant time and
resources

**What's Going Well?**
*   **Team** - growing, added significant ops and clinical expertise
*   **Ops** - resolved existential threat with fire department, roof, and construction resumed
*   **Tech** - great feedback from West Health and converting into first paying customer, continuing to double down on internal roadmap

**What's Not Going Well?**
*   **Team** - cultural challenges integrating new members of the team
*   **Ops** - real estate budget ballooned significantly ($9.8 → $11.5M), Astrana contract lagging behind
*   **Tech** - challenging to hire senior healthcare engineers; hit snags with NPA thread (board/On Lok pushback)
*   **Expansion** - no easy path forward, still exploring given limited resources

## Slide 5: Key Decision: Release $3M from Series A second tranche ahead of SRR on 8/15/24
FOUNDER UPDATES
Key Decision: Release $3M from Series A second tranche ahead of
SRR on 8/15/24

**Rationale**
$3M would give Seen ample funds to
*   Charge full speed ahead toward SRR and Day 1
*   Secure additional resources to support SRR efforts
*   Create cushion for any unforeseen challenges between now and opening

**Alternatives**
*   **Ride it out** - current balance sheet should cover us before the NCB CapEx credit line opens up in August. However, we would hit dangerously close to the reserves limits and need to clamp down hiring / burn
*   **Bringing new investors** - raising additional funds from new investors would create distractions for us in a critical execution period and would take time to materialize. We would prefer to raise funds from a point of strength and/or have shovel ready JVs / deals to execute

## Slide 9: Cash Needs
FINANCIALS
Cash Needs

**Sources of Cash**
*   NCB providing $9M+ debt facility, $5.75M operating line of credit and $3.4M construction loan
*   At a conservative 8 net adds, center expected to generate $2.7M in revenue in first 6 months, and $8.6M over first year
*   PACE regulatory liquidity requirements and real estate collateral requires $1M-$2M of cash reserves over the next year
*   Reserve requirements increases as SGV grows, 1 month of total operating expenses
*   Seen Health in a strong financial position to ensure a successful launch of SGV and position itself for further growth opportunities

*(Note: The bar chart shows stacked values for different expense categories. The text OCR only picked up one value per month. Assuming the largest visible part of the bar chart represents "Tech - Other" in early months, and then other expenses are stacked on top, but the provided OCR is insufficient to fully break down the stacked bars by category. I am extracting the total value as seen by the top of the bar for each month as if it were a single value.)*

## Slide 10: Funding Needs

Funding Needs

**Uses of Cash**

## Slide 19: Strong engagement from focus groups at local senior centers
OPS
Strong engagement from focus groups at local senior centers

*   **Enthusiasm from audience:** our team went to 3 senior centers for focus groups and surveys by offering micro incentives to get them engaged; offline channels like this will be key for our growth
*   **Overwhelmingly Chinese speaking:** 84% of folks who filled out surveys are Chinese or Taiwanese
*   **Eligibility:** ~30% of seniors surveyed are Dual Eligible, ~42% have Medicare.
*   **Decision Making:** 75% tend to make their own healthcare decisions, 61% trusts their doctor/pharmacist and 24% trust their family in looking for healthcare and home care services
*   **Reason for switching:** The decision of switching varies, with focus on concerns about the transitioning process & familiarity with personal medical history, especially in moving away from their current PCP
*   **Participants appreciate the convenience of a "one-stop shop" service.**

**Images:**
1.  A large room with many seniors seated at tables, participating in an event.
2.  A group of people, likely team members and seniors, smiling and holding gift baskets.
3.  A woman presenting to a group of seniors seated at tables in a smaller setting. A sign for "Seen Health" in Chinese characters is visible.

    *   **Center 1 Build / Build partner pipeline**
        *   Primary focus is to build Center 1 and prove value
        *   Build partnership pipeline of those with aligned cultural focus to leverage existing assets
*   **2025:**
    *   **Center 1 Go Live / Earliest potential partner launch**
        *   Possible to launch with strategic partners already in pipeline (e.g., those already in application process in CA, NY, etc.)
*   **2026:**
    *   **Launch multiple centers with partners**
        *   With 1+ year experience, data assets available to support multiple partners across states

## Slide 28: California in particular has seen significant PACE interest
CORP + EXPANSION
California in particular has seen significant PACE interest

There are several upcoming California PACE centers - however the most significant entrant is Habitat Health (Kaiser/Townhall)

**California PACE summary**

**New PACE Applications per year**
**Chart Data:**
| Year | FQHCs | Non-FQHC applications |
| :--- | :---- | :------------------ |
| 2020 | 0     | 3                   |
| 2021 | 9     | 4                   |
| 2022 | 10    | 4                   |
| 2023 | 8     | 2                   |

*   The number of applications from FQHCs for California has been steadily increasing
*   "includes expansion applications to new centers"

**Tungsten Health → Habitat Health**

**Key Notes**
*   Townhall Ventures was an early investor in WelBe
*   Andy Slavitt has been promoting PACE heavily for the past year
*   Townhall JV with Kaiser has flown through regulatory process
*   Kaiser is one of the managed care providers for Medi-Cal

**What this means**
*   **Heightened Visibility and Credibility:** Kaiser Permanente's entry into PACE enhances the program's profile, attracting attention and lending credibility to its care model for the elderly.
*   **Policy Influence:** Kaiser's participation may bolster advocacy for PACE, potentially influencing policy changes and funding models to support the program's growth and sustainability.
*   **Strategic Positioning for PACE Centers:** Kaiser's foray into PACE highlights the importance for existing and prospective centers to enhance their value proposition to navigate the competitive landscape effectively.

## Slide 29: Recent regulatory development largely support PACE growth
CORP + EXPANSION
Recent regulatory development largely support PACE growth

PACE is coming across many legislative bodies, both at the state and federal level

**Congressional Activities**

*   **+ (DUALS) Act of 2024**
    *   Expands PACE Nationwide and allows anytime enrollment
    *   Extends PACE eligibility to Medicare beneficiaries under age 55
    *   *Expected to fail, but this represents significant movement for PACE and increased awareness.*
*   **CMS cut of 0.16% for MA payments**
    *   MA rates face a potential 0.2% reduction as proposed by CMS. However, analysts said regulators are likely to increase the payout rate in the final announcement.
*   **+ Elizabeth Dole Home Care Act**
    *   Expands access to PACE for veterans whose LTC costs are covered by the VA
    *   *Expected to pass without much resistance*
*   **+ More accurate dementia reporting**
    *   CMS is updating PACE programs to use the EDS for reporting, aiming for more accurate patient data and payments, especially for those with dementia and chronic conditions.

**PACE application process in States**

*   **New York**
    *   PACE is part of the NY State Dual Eligible Integrated Care Roadmap. Legislative change expected early 2024 to have a "unified licensure process" (tracking here). The intention is to support "prudent development" of PACE and expected to allow for for-profit entry
*   **Georgia**
    *   PACE is likely to be signed into law in Georgia (pending signature from Gov Brian Kemp)
    *   The house passed a bill that would allow assisted living communities, personal care homes, and other providers of home and community-based services to enroll as Medicaid providers and receive Medicaid funds
*   **California**
    *   **Senate Bill 770: Step towards single payer**
        *   Eliminate distinctions between Medicare, Medi-Cal, employer-sponsored insurance, and individual market coverage within the unified financing system
        *   *Final framework provided November 1, 2025 - there is some resistance*
    *   **+ Medicaid income limit removal 2025**
        *   California removes the Medi-Cal asset test, letting recipients keep more savings without losing coverage; income limits still apply.
        *   This adjustment could expand Medi-Cal's reach, potentially benefiting nearly 2 million enrollees in the state.
*   **Minnesota**
    *   The bill states Minnesota must file an amendment with the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services by Oct. 1, 2024. PACE providers would be identified through a competitive bidding process administered by the Department of Human Services, with programming beginning Jan. 1, 2026.
*   **Nevada**
    *   HMA conducted an evaluation of PACE model for Nevada Medicaid - and recommended for PACE to be implemented however no earlier than 2028.

NY: Currently exploring with potential partner

**Legislative Status**
**New York application has been historically complicated and limited for for-profit entry. However New York is expected to streamline licensure H1 2024**

**With new process, Article 28 expected to allow to be contracted**
**Requirements in NY:**
1.  Article 44, To receive capitated payment
    Must possess
2.  Article 28, To deliver care in clinical setting
    Must possess
3.  Article 36, To deliver care in home
    Can contract

**Potential PACE Operating Structure:**
*   Qualifying Parent Entity under 4403-f (e.g., HMO, LHCSA)
*   Common Ownership
*   PACE Organization with Integrated PACE Center (Article 44 and Article 28 D&TC License)
*   Services Agreement
*   Article 36 Provider
*   NEW YORK STATE Department of Health

| **84,000**         | 9 incumbents serving 10% of eligibles | **Dense** In many concentrated pockets | **2027** Depends on licensure speed | **Non-profit partner** Licensure requires non-profit entity |

**Potential Partner: Centro de Amigos**
**Potential technology and minority partnership with Centro De Amigos**

**Summary:**
Centro De Amigos, an ADHC focusing on the Hispanic community in Rockland, NY, is in the early stages of converting to a PACE center.
They have deep familiarity with seniors and physician network in Rockland, NY and are assessing capital needs and waiting for New York DOH legislative update to allow for clinic to be contracted.

**Seen Health Expected Value:**
As part of this venture, the expected contribution is in the role of a minority partner and technology provider

**Timeline:**
Minimum of two years

**Key barriers are**
1) Time: contingent on licensure updates
2) Capital needs - requires two years of cash reserves

## Slide 33: GA: Bill to support PACE active, expected to signed this month
CORP + EXPANSION
GA: Bill to support PACE active, expected to signed this month

**Legislative Status**
**Georgia is actively passing legislation to allow for PACE**
*   **February 26, 2024:** PACE legislation passed in Georgia House
*   **March 8, 2024:** PACE legislation passed in Georgia Senate
*   **April 1, 2024:** House sent approved bill to Governor to sign
**Present:**
*   **Governor Brian Kemp is expected to sign bill allowing for PACE this month**
**Next step:** After Governor signature, there will be a 3-9 month process for rate approval. After this the legislation will decide if it will be an RFP or application process.

**Existing Competitors:** WelBe and Kinship have already begun lobbying efforts in Georgia (though unclear to what extent)

|                   | Unserved Eligibles | AAPI                | Timeline                  | Partner            |

**Seen Health next steps**
Seen Health is employing a consultant with previous experience winning RFPs for Edenbridge to help us evaluate the Georgia market and likelihood for entry.

Estimate for pre-application market development cost is minimum of $200,000

**FY24 Projection**
| Item                | Subtotal |
| :------------------ | :------- |
| Senior Staffer      | 58988    |
| Junior Staffer      | 27528    |

| Materials           | 1000     |
| **Totals**          | **$223,515** |

Additionally for Georgia there may be partners that have already been pre-selected for the RFP bid - this is yet to be verified.
However, since it is the market with highest PACE eligibility without PACE yet, and few competitive DUALS products, we are evaluating to answer early questions about the market.

*   **Services In Scope:** Fully integrates Medicaid, Medicare & HCBS
*   **Key Strategic Attributes:** Nursing Home Diversion, exceptional coordination of care, cost savings & improved quality
*   **Rural Impact:** State has levers available to drive PACE for rural impact as desired
*   **Recommended Implementation Date:** No earlier than 2028

**Next steps:** Nevada Medicaid must review HMA's recommendation and issue a final report to inform future initiatives
**However based on recommendation, PACE will be implemented no earlier than 2028**

**Timeline:** With PACE implemented at its earliest in 2028, Seen Health will at its earliest only be able to open PACE in 2028
However, will confirm as Nevada Medicaid evaluates HMA's assessment

**Partner:** Astrana Health (formerly Apollo Med) has a deep interest in Nevada and is beginning to build out their network. Therefore when Nevada opens, Seen Health will be able to take advantage of an in built, culturally focused network

**Takeaway:** We will continue to evaluate, however no movement will happen in near future

    *   24-36 mth
    *   High-touch care model operated via manual workflows and disjointed tools
    *   State & federal compliance requirements add operations burden
    *   Challenging provider & staff recruitment / retention
    *   Inconsistent care plan management and follow-thorough erodes care quality

**Typical PACE Center Timeline:**
*   Center Opens: 0 census
*   Breakeven: 150 census
*   Reaches Capacity: 300-500 census
    *   Low Margins: 10-15% Gross, 5-7% EBITDA

**Summary Cost/Time:**
~$15M + 7 yrs = price of admission

## Slide 49: Compress time-to-capacity to 3-5 yrs in order to expand predictably
END STATE
Compress time-to-capacity to 3-5 yrs in order to expand predictably

**Accelerated Outcomes with Seen Health Model:**
*   **Center Breakeven**
    *   9-12 mth
    *   $3-4 M
    *   Accelerated participant ramp
    *   Balanced staff growth without sacrificing quality
    *   Operating losses financed via specialized lender
*   **Reaches Capacity**
    *   500 census
*   **Expanded Margins**
    *   25% Gross
    *   10-15% EBITDA
*   **Startup**
    *   12-24 mth
    *   $5-18M
    *   Playbooked application & approvals
    *   Consistent site selection & design
    *   Proven real estate development via partnership or with financing
*   **Center Opens**
    *   20-40 census
*   **Breaks Even**
    *   150 census
*   **Scale and Reach Capacity**
    *   18-24 mth
    *   Sustained participant growth
    *   Improved provider and staff effectiveness and retention, and practice at top of license
    *   Automated compliance and back office

**Summary Cost/Time:**
~$15M + 7 yrs = price of admission (same as historical challenges, but likely indicating that this is still the general investment required, but with a faster path to capacity and breakeven)

First Criteria: PACE Status

This includes states where PACE exists and/or PACE is being considered in legislative body

**Diagram:**
*   **PACE growth** (top right of diamond)
*   **Unserved Eligibles** (bottom right of diamond)
*   **PACE status** (left of diamond)

**PACE Status (Text Box)**
*   **PACE Exists:** PACE is currently in 32 states/regions, most recently in DC
*   **PACE upcoming:** PACE also issued recent RFPs in New Jersey, Ohio, Oregon, Louisiana, Illinois
*   **PACE consideration:** PACE is being considered in Nevada, Minnesota, Georgia, South Dakota, and Connecticut

**Map of US:**
*   **Dark Green:** States with existing PACE programs (includes CA, OR, WA, AZ, CO, NM, TX, LA, AR, MO, IL, IN, MI, OH, KY, TN, GA, FL, SC, NC, VA, WV, PA, NY, MA, CT, NJ, MD, DE, DC, ME, RI)
*   **Light Grey/White:** States without existing PACE programs

## Slide 55: Second Criteria: States with active/upcoming PACE opportunities
CORP + EXPANSION
Second Criteria: States with active/upcoming PACE opportunities

Only states with active PACE applications or upcoming/expected RFPs are being considered for immediate expansion

**Diagram:**
*   **PACE growth** (top right of diamond)
*   **Unserved Eligibles** (bottom right of diamond)
*   **PACE status** (left of diamond)

**PACE Growth (Text Box)**
We removed states that are not considering expansion due to:
1.  **Recent RFP**
    *   E.g., New Jersey, Ohio, Oregon, Louisiana, Illinois
2.  **Saturated**
    *   E.g., Michigan, North Carolina, Virginia
3.  **No applications processed due to political climate**
    *   E.g. Texas, New Mexico

**Map of US:**
*   **Dark Green:** States with active PACE plans (includes CA, OR, WA, AZ, CO, NM, LA, AR, MO, IL, IN, MI, OH, KY, TN, GA, FL, SC, NC, VA, WV, PA, NY, MA, CT, NJ, MD, DE, DC, ME, RI)
*   **Light Green:** States with no upcoming expansion (removed due to saturation or political climate)
*   **Light Grey/White:** States not considering expansion (removed due to recent RFP)

## Slide 56: Third Criteria: Addressable PACE Eligibles
CORP + EXPANSION
Third Criteria: Addressable PACE Eligibles

Currently, in order to expand within the next two year we are prioritizing minority JV partnerships in key markets

**Diagram:**
*   **PACE growth** (top right of diamond)
*   **Unserved Eligibles** (bottom right of diamond)
*   **PACE status** (left of diamond)

**Unserved Eligibles (Text Box)**
We removed states where all high eligibility service areas are already being served:
1.  **Colorado**
    *   Already 73% of the population lives in an area that is currently being served by a PACE organization
2.  **Florida**
    *   Florida had a land-grab in 2021 where all main service service areas are being served

**Map of US:**
*   **Dark Green:** States with active PACE plans (same as previous slide)
*   **Light Green:** States with no upcoming expansion (same as previous slide)
*   **Medium Green (lighter than dark green):** High Eligibility Service Areas served (e.g., CO, FL - visually lighter than states with active PACE plans but darker than no upcoming expansion)
*   **Light Grey/White:** States not considering expansion (same as previous slide)

## Slide 57: Four Criteria: Cultural Subgroup Concentration/Service Area
CORP + EXPANSION
Four Criteria: Cultural Subgroup Concentration/Service Area

Currently, in order to expand within the next two year we are prioritizing minority JV partnerships in key markets

**Diagram:**
*   **PACE growth** (top right of diamond)
*   **Unserved Eligibles** (bottom right of diamond)
*   **PACE status** (left of diamond)
*   **Overlapping Service Areas** (bottom left of diamond)
*   **Cultural Population** (top left of diamond)

**Service Area/Culture (Text Box)**
Focus is primarily on states that allow or might allow areas to overlap. This is essential for targeting specific cultural focuses without the need to serve the entire broader area.
Currently, only New York, Washington, and California have overlapping service areas, with Nevada and Georgia possibly permitting this in the future.

**Map of US:**
*   **Dark Green:** States with active PACE plans
*   **Light Green:** States with no upcoming expansion
*   **Medium Green (lighter than dark green):** High Eligibility Service Areas served
*   **Light Green (very light):** No expected overlapping zipcodes (e.g., states where overlapping is not permitted or expected)
*   **Light Grey/White:** States not considering expansion
