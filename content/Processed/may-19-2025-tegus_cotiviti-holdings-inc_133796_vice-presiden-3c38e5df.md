**A:** Yes, i just did a webinar on this yesterday!

## Client
Hi. Nice to meet you and appreciate you taking the time. They shared a little bit of context with you, but I am looking to get up to speed on the payment integrity space as well as the role that AI can play in streamlining the space and what the existing vendor landscape looks like in terms of size and players. Maybe just to kick things off, can you share a little bit of context on your background?

## Expert
Yes. I'm getting old, so it's not a good place to start, but I started in PI in the late '90s in subrogation, which is the first vendor outsourced area. We grew that business and were acquired by UnitedHealth Group in 2001, so I did 12 years then at United, touched everything payment integrity. We were the first business to implement machine learning, predictive modeling, and payment integrity, and did that in prepay in mid 2000s.

From there, done a lot of different things. Ran a specialty BPO, worked for LexisNexis, selling data for a while, which was interesting, but always came back to payment integrity. Currently at a vendor named. Before that, was the general manager of the commercial facing PI business at Elemental. Still hands on, still write code, still teach people how to do payment integrity, you name it.

## Client
Okay. You are certainly an expert. As you think about this market, can you maybe just give me a five-minute primer on how it works, where the value is, what the market size is?

## Expert
Yes. Huge market. You think about the big players, Cotiviti, Optum, Zelis, plays in the market. Their biggest footprint is on the TPA side versus the large payer, but they do have large payer customers. There's always vendors coming into the market, and they tend to get gobbled up over time as they get a little bit of size.

## Client
Who is gobbling them up?

## Expert
A lot of PE firms. New Mountain is a good example. They, years ago, built a business called Equian, which United bought. They're doing it again. They bought ClaimLogiq, Machinify, a handful of other things, Rawlings, and they've kept the name Machinify, which I don't really know why, but they did. That's an example. There are smaller players in the market. There's one out of Texas, and they've slowly been acquiring things. Anyways, there's just this constant consolidation, and then new vendors come in the market. The good ones grow, the bad ones bump along and people wonder what will happen with them, for lack of a better way of saying it. It's a huge market.

## Client
Got it. I'll let you continue on with your market primer.

## Expert
Yeah. I don't know what else to tell you. There's really a handful of disciplines. Subrogation, as I mentioned, has been around forever. That market was sorted by George Rawlings who since passed away. As I mentioned, New Mountain bought that company. Optum, huge player, they probably have 1/3 of the market. Not super exciting, it's pretty boring.

## Client
What is subrogation?

## Expert
Sure. If you have an accident, the health insurer generally will pay the claims, and subrogation is the right that lets them go back and recover the money. COB is another huge area. COB, I don't know that anyone's really good at it. That's really all about who should have paid primary, who should pay secondary, tertiary, then you get into fraud, waste, and abuse.

Fraud, waste, and abuse, historically, was a post-pay area that people would focus on. A lot of that has moved towards prepay, where, "Hey, we don't believe this claim is right or that you're billing things accurately. Send us in the record so that we can do validation of what's happening." Been around forever. Again, probably a fragmented market would be the best way to describe it, so you can buy case management, you can buy detection for fraud, waste, and abuse or potential fraud, waste, and abuse, combination of the two.

Clinical audit has existed for quite a long time. We used to call it hospital bill audit. You'll hear it referred to a lot as DRG. Now, again, that has shifted from a post-pay to more of a prepay focus. When you think about GenAI, anything clinical review, that's the next thing that everyone's waiting for. Who's going to do it well?

## Client
No one does the full review well today?

## Expert
No. They do it, but in terms of doing it in a more automated fashion. In the early 2010s, everyone was focused on NLP and how can I use NLP to help me review a record. Now, everyone's wondering when's the computer going to do the review for me? There's a bunch of vendors saying they do it. I don't know that I believe any of them yet is how I would say it. That's the next big change, I think, people are waiting for, and then there's this continuum of things we talk about.

## Client
I'm going to interrupt you and take you all the way back. Can you maybe talk to me like I am dumber and going through this process? God forbid, I'm in a car accident. My health insurance is through United. What happens next?

## Expert
Yes. United, because they use their own vendor, Optum, to do the work.

## Client
All right. Let's say I'm with Blue Shield of North Carolina.

## Expert
What's going to happen is they may send a letter before they pay your claim, and they might inquire about what happened. If you had a really bad accident, you're probably in the hospital, you can't reply to the letter. They're going to either pen the claim pending information from you, or they're going to pay it. There's another service on the P&C side called ISO.

ISO is set up to combat fraud on the property and casualty market. Your P&C carrier, let's say you had USAA, they may send in the information around your accident to ISO. Healthcare and subrogation vendors have figured out that they can subscribe to ISO. Let's say bad accidents, so a few hundred thousand dollars of claims have come in. Your hospital supposed to flag those as motor vehicle accidents, so North Carolina might reach out to ISO and say, "Hey, do you have any information on this motor vehicle accident?"

Because USAA sent it in, they at least would know, "Yep, there's a motor vehicle accident." They might be able to get the accident report, the property, and casualty insurer information, potentially attorney information, and that's the foundation for subrogation. They're going to say, "Oh, this is great. She's got great limits. We're not worried about paying it. We'll be able to recover," or they might say, "Boy, she's only got $250,000 of coverage. Let's make sure we get everyone on notice and protect our interests and maybe push to have it paid through P&C before we pay it."

## Client
Got it. Subrogation happens after the accident or happens after it's already been paid?

## Expert
Technically, the right of subrogation doesn't exist until I've paid $1. You'll hear Optum does what they call prepay subro. It's not really subro, it's prepay coordination with the P&C carriers. As far as I know, they're still the only one doing prepay. You'll see businesses like Blue Cross Blue Shield of Minnesota, for example. They do it internally, but they really think about it as coordination. That's the most mature vended solution in the market. If you were to ask Optum, they would probably say their subrogation figure is high. When I was there, the margin on it is super high.

## Client
That's what I would say the Optum would value the business at. From a market size, Rawlings sold for, I haven't looked it up for a while, so I don't remember, but off the top of my head, I think it was north of a $3 billion acquisition for New Mountain. That number should be out on the Internet somewhere.

Yes. In terms of market opportunity beyond subrogation, there is the existing market size and then there's how AI expands that market. How do you think about that? I think also related to that, because it's probably obvious, but I'm trying to understand, can a net new AI business be built in the payment integrity space? I would love to better understand why it sounds like there are more point solutions today, or someone does subrogation where someone does something else, versus is there to be made for this all living under the same roof.

## Expert
Yes. Cotiviti and Optum are probably the two vendors that do everything. Machinify, I would put in that category now too. I think they've bought a vendor that does all the different solutions in the PI marketplace. That's the first thing. Part of the challenge is they're different. Subrogation is very different than overpayment, recovery is very different than COB. I think a lot of businesses think, "Hey, let's start in one discipline. As we acquire customers, we can either buy a business or build out the functionality." There's truth in that, but I think you want to start with one thing and capture customers, and then work on the consulting model of land and grab more business.

AI absolutely is changing things. There's different ways that AI gets used. One is, how do we find whatever it is? If we're doing subros, how do I find accidents that others don't find? If it's fraud, waste, and abuse, it's how do I find anomalies that are inappropriate versus anomalies that are just really sick people, for example.

With GenAI, it's how do I use a tool like GenAI to interrogate clinical records, for example, or call logs. That's the stuff that if you go out and search on Google, you can read about companies now that claim they do that. We're one of them. Where I work today,. we have a GenAI-based widget that helps you consume medical records. It doesn't actually do all the work for you, it makes it just much more efficient. I think people are waiting for that solution that you can just throw everything in, and you get the answer. I don't think anyone quite has that yet.

## Client
You're saying the holy grail would be a one-stop shop?

## Expert
Correct. There's other factors in the market.

## Client
As you think about the one-stop shop, what all would they do?

## Expert
That's a really good question. If you think about PI in its simplest form, I want to ensure that the risk is assigned to the right party, that the right party is paying for it, so that could be COB or subrogation, that they're receiving a claim that was delivered appropriately, that the healthcare need of the member, was delivered by a licensed professional who was qualified to deliver the care, that it was coded correctly, that the contract and benefit packages were applied correctly to the claim once it's received by the payer, and then paid correctly.

Every step in that process has the potential for issues. That's really what a full end-to-end shop would do. Within that, it would understand the hierarchy of when to apply the most appropriate discipline that has the least likelihood of changing over time, because oftentimes you'll find something, but you'll find five things on a claim. If you don't do the right thing first, you end up potentially paying later after you recover money, for example. It can get messy.

## Client
Got it. As you think about, you probably argue both sides of this, reason that an incumbent would ultimately win this AI-led future versus reasons for a start-up to win, how do you think about those trade-offs?

## Expert
That's a good question. If I put a buyer hat on, and I've been on the payer side as the party buying a service or solution, I don't get in trouble for hiring IBM. I get in trouble for hiring the mom-and-pop shop that ends up not being good at it. That's the conundrum when you think about from the purchaser side. The flip side is the big companies in our space tend to be less flexible, less innovative. They were innovative 20 years ago when they might have formed, or 15, like Cotiviti. When you think about the merger of iHealth and Connolly, they're not as innovative. They probably would say they are. I don't know that they are. They're still a good company. They create value for their customers.

On the incumbent side, I think it's, "Hey, can you demonstrate that you have the financial backing that you're going to be around in three years, and then can you convince a payer that they should share their data with you so that you can prove the value proposition of your business?"There are companies doing that. There are always new companies coming in, and the ones that are good, they get a few customers which then ends up to 10 customers and then 20 customers, because they're able to provide value. It just takes time to gain credibility. After you get that first customer, then how fast can you accelerate?

## Client
Got it. How good is Cotiviti when it comes to tech? Is their solution technically impressive, or it's more of a team of people that operate well?

## Expert
That's such a good question. In their foundation, when you think about the two companies that merged to form Cotiviti, Connolly was the best post-pay overpayment vendor. They were the best because they had the best people, and they had the best people because they basically rewarded them for what they found. The data mining person, you could make $150,000 a year if you're good at it, which back then was a lot of money.

I had a vision of doing things prepay, and they built a really good tool because they basically researched everything, and they had the most complete library, so their tech was fantastic in the sense that they had a complete library. They gave you the menu. As a buyer, I get 700 edits to look at and choose from in a specific space, and they have the ability to turn things on and off very efficiently.

I think there's a combination of the two. I don't know that they've kept up as much on the new tech side, so they're still really good at doing second pass edits because they've got this amazing library, and they maintain it. Beyond what we would call second pass edits, I don't know that they're great at anything. They're good at everything. I don't know that they're great at anything, but you don't get in trouble for hiring Cotiviti, other than maybe your providers don't like you.

## Client
Got it. Cotiviti, it was acquired for under $10 billion or something like that. If Cotiviti were doing more of the before-treatment screening and some of the wish lists that you outlined, do you think it would bec the same size business? Would be twice as large a business? Would it be 3X as large of a business?

## Expert
That's such a good question. Optum and Cotiviti came out, in the last year and a half, two years, with, I forget what they call the product. They were trying to figure out how to get the claim to come in correctly from the clearinghouse or the RCM to the payer.

If I can get a clean claim submitted, there's a great deal of value in that for the provider and for the payer because then it's going to go through and it's going to pay first time through. It's a super interesting idea that they have, and I don't know who started, if it's Cotiviti or Optum, or if they did it independently, or if one was a response to the other. I just don't know that they've had much adoption yet. What's interesting about it is, theoretically, you could get paid on both sides. You could get something from the provider or the RCM, and something from the payer.

At one point, Cotiviti was valued at somewhere over $10 billion, so that's come down quite a bit over the last five years, probably overvalued at somewhere over $10 billion to begin with. I think that next iteration of the solution, whether it's what they're trying to do, getting a clean claim submitted from the get-go, if they figured out the Ge nAI piece to do the clinical component and could integrate it the large systems like Epic, whoever does that is going to be worth a ton of money because that's not just PI that gets into prior auth, that gets into all kinds of stuff.

## Client
Yes. Maybe double-clicking on that, when you say the next gen would have a clinical component, how would that work, and what all would it span? It would be prior auth, but still payer-facing, or you're saying it would be provider-facing?

## Expert
Sure. There are products in the market trying to solve the prior auth side, like Humata, Dr. Jeremy Friese is from Minnesota. He's a good guy. There's people trying to solve it from that side, but at the end of the day, it's the same problem, can I take clinical information and provide and make a decision about appropriateness of care, whether that's in a prior auth situation, where you're saying, "Yep, it's okay to do the care," or once the care is delivered, "Hey, was that care appropriate and billed correctly?"

The challenge used to be, "Can I get a medical record?" Back in the day, 20 years ago, you might get a banker box of paper, then we got to the point where we were scanning everything and we could convert it to an image. The question was, "Can I convert the image to digital, and at least search it using NLP?"We got to the point where we could do that. Now, it's, "Can I interrogate that record using GenAI, and as I interrogate it, how automated can I make that process? Do I have a large language model that understands enough about care delivery and appropriate care delivery that it can make it very efficient for me to do that work?" When you're thinking about that big of a record, at United, for example, we had a movable stack in Florida because we had so much paper.

## Client
Got it. I wl know it's a little bit of an unfair question with limited information, if you found an amazing team building the next-gen AI-powered PI platform, is it something you would be interested in, or you would say, "Yeah, this is a viable very large business," or you say, "Good luck competing against Cotiviti. That seems challenging"?

## Expert
I met a now seven-year-old start-up and the founder did his PhD at Georgia Tech trying to find fraud, waste, and abuse in CMS, and ultimately patented the algorithm you wrote. I'm open to it. I think there are buyers in the market that are open to new solutions, that are open to new technology-based solutions, and that's the key. If you're looking at investing in one of those start-ups, it's, "Can we get to the right payers?" generally more of a mid-market.

You can go to a United too. United will say, "Hey, that's interesting, let us take a stake in it," if they find the technology compelling, but you need a buyer that's smart enough to ask the questions and understand what you're doing and believe that it's true and then get that proof of concept setup or pilot, and then you're off and running. Once you have one and they're willing to talk about it and to be a reference, especially in the Blues world, if you get one Blue and they're willing to be a reference, it makes all the difference because they all know each other.

## Client
Got it. This has been super helpful. I appreciate you taking the time.
