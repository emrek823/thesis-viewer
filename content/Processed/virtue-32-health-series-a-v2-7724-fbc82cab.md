“Our very manual, time-consuming and error-prone processes needed the injection of technology designed by those who have walked more than a mile in our shoes. 32Health understands, and has lived through, the painstaking process of credentialing and recredentialing through their shared experiences. They combined that history with incredibly nimble technical expertise and created just the tool we needed to push the EASY button for us in the credentialing area. We have been able to free up our people to do what humans do best in provider relations—foster relationships with our dental offices. We are saving time, money, labor and have improved employee satisfaction with the job we and they would rather be doing!"

2.  **Documentation**
    *   Narrate the care provided
3.  **CDI & Coding**

4.  **Payor validation**
    *   Defend and receive payment

| Hard to hire | Requires clinical expertise (e.g. nurse), which is particularly challenging today given scarcity. |
| Losing money | The average 350-bed hospital misses $22M in potential annual revenue due to RCM (Advisory Board, 2017) |
| Low margins | Median US hospital margin was 1.6% in October 2023. 2% is the 'new normal' (Health Management Academy, 2024) |
