### Blueprint Strategy & Execution

- Investor feedback challenge: belief that multi-company model isn’t feasible
	- Lack of specificity from VCs (Lightspeed, Transformations, Remind)
	- “Never been done before” pushback despite explanations
	- PowerPoint slides insufficient - need to demonstrate proof
- 25-50M raise contingent on proving Blueprint is possible
	- Current 3-4M raise oriented around proving concept
	- 4 key proof points needed:
- Timeline pressure: 11 months to ideate, diligence, build, acquire and launch new OpCo
- Capital allocation: ~$1.65M over 2 years for Blueprint validation
	- $600K annual salaries (2 hires at $300K each including benefits)
	- $100K tech diligence
	- $250K acquisition
- Acquisition vs build debate for next OpCo
	- Acquisition faster but dilutes narrative vs Anna’s build story
	- Plan to parallel process both approaches

### Anna Business Performance & Expansion

- Current runway: burn down to $1.9M by late 2027, then cash flow positive
	- Based on Massachusetts only, excludes new states
	- $1.26M contribution profit expected in 2026 vs $233K cash flow (working capital gap)
- State expansion via M&A proving more efficient than organic contracting
	- Minnesota: excellent market, small purchase price despite political concerns
	- Missouri: commercial-focused, great rates, uncompetitive, deal closing in weeks
	- Florida: potential distressed acquisition, owners folding after 6 months
- Assessment revenue ~$6M+ (October data, new Salesforce system reporting pending)
- Key operational priorities still needed:
	- Chief clinical officer hire (interviews next week)
	- BCBA margin consistency
	- Unit level ramp improvements
	- Braintree and Foxborough location launches

### Funding & Next Steps

- Current round progress: Sunflower and Watershed committed, Remind reviewing
- Target: $2.7M total (vs original $3-4M need)
- Closing expected next Wednesday
- Year-end financials closing, board meeting to follow
- Pro rata waiver documentation received from Virtue
