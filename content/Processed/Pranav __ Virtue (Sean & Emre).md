### Product Vision & Strategy

- Users disintermediating traditional healthcare system
- Decouples state and action in healthcare/bio approaches
- Three classes of diagnostics:
	- Continuous/24-7 monitoring (CGMs, wearables, saliva testing for cortisol/progesterone)
	- Low measurement cost but high analytics cost (Tasso at-home blood tests)
	- High OpEx/CapEx for measurement and analytics (Forward Health model - centralized care)
- Currently focusing on Class I diagnostics integration (20+ wearable integrations)
- Targeting Class II/III as highest ROI for consumers
- Five key recommendation categories:
	- Diet
	- Exercise
	- Sleep
	- Supplementation
	- Clinical follow-up
- Follow-up blood tests every 4 months with two panel types:
	- Athletic optimization panel
	- Preventative health panel

### Distribution Strategy

- Addressing crowded space with differentiated approach
- Moving beyond informational MD-focused content
- Focus on entertainment over education
- Key channels:
	- Creative producer (ex-Nike, Alo) creating aesthetic content
