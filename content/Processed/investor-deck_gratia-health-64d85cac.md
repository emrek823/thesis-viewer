## Slide 3: The Problem
### THE PROBLEM

Hospitals are struggling to recruit, motivate, and retain staffed nurses

**HEALTHCARE WORKERS**

**BURNOUT**
* 35-54% of nurses are reporting symptoms of burnout

**UNDERPAID & UNDERAPPRECIATED**
* 87% of nurses say they aren't compensated enough

**LOSS OF COMMUNITY**
* 85% of nurses report planning to leave the profession within a year

**HEALTHCARE EMPLOYERS**

**GROWING CONTRACTOR COSTS**
* Travel nurse wages are on average 2-3x more than a hospital employed nurse

**RECRUITMENT**
* The average hospital RN vacancy rate currently stands at 17%.

**RETENTION**
* The turnover rate for hospital RNs currently stands at 27.1%.

## Slide 4: How Industry Is Solving The Problem Today
### HOW INDUSTRY IS SOLVING THE PROBLEM TODAY

There is an opportunity to uplevel how rewards are done in healthcare

**GIG ECONOMY LOCUMS APPS**
* Systems leverage contract nurses on a per shift basis
* Makes it easier to secure expensive labor, perpetuates reliance on contract workers and doesn't solve core issue
* Solve the symptom not the core issue

**DIY REWARDS**
* Managing rewards programs is **cumbersome and time intensive**
* Little strategy in incentive design “throwing dollars at it"
* Programs are usually **managed off pen-paper and excel** and **communicated via email / word of mouth**
* **No centralized organization**: different programs floating around by region and facility
* Calculating and **understanding ROI is often a black box**
