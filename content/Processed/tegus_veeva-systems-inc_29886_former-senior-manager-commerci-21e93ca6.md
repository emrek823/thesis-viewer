## Tegus Client
Thanks for taking the time to speak today. I'm doing some research now on Veeva Systems and basically just trying to sort of at a high level, better understand the business, kind of the competitive landscape, market opportunity, things like that. And so it'd be great to just kind of pick your brain on whatever sort of topics you know best as it relates to their business, and we can sort of structure it that way. But maybe before we get

into sort of Veeva specifically, if you could just tell me sort of a bit more about your background and sort of your specific role when you were there.

## Former Senior Manager, Commercial Strategy at Veeva Systems Inc
Absolutely. So my background, I've spent the last 15 years in software technology and life sciences. So I started in my career back in 2010, focused on life sciences and technology and then move from there to Veeva, where I headed up new product launches in the commercial space.

So on the commercial side of Veeva's portfolio, I was there until I think 2018, I left to a start-up that was in eCOA/ePRO. So more on the clinical and R&D side of the house. And so I know that market quite well in terms of market landscape competitors and opportunity. I've since founded my own business in the eClinical space. So again, I understand that market very, very well. But from a Veeva perspective, I can talk deeply about the CRM and the commercial opportunities that it has.

So by commercial, I mean helping pharmaceutical companies go to market. And by R&D and clinical, I mean helping pharmaceutical companies manage their clinical development process, to get their drugs to market. So there's that divide within Veeva and the industry. So I know Veeva deeply on the commercial side, but I can talk to the broader market on the R&D side as well where Veeva is very active, but less knowledgeable on their platform and solutions on the clinical side.

## Tegus Client
Yes, that makes a lot of sense. And I guess when you were on the commercial side at Veeva, like what specifically was your role? Were you in sort of product development strategy, sales?

## Former Senior Manager, Commercial Strategy at Veeva Systems Inc
Strategy. So the strategy team at Veeva when it's on new product development is tasked with finding early adopters for the product, bringing that product to market, so I had sort of oversight of product strategy for my region, Europe sales strategy, solution consulting demos, and implementation of early customers as well and also marketing conferences. So it's sort of like a mini GM role of that particular product in that particular market. And I looked after two commercial products that Veeva brought to market in 2014 that are still in use today and still growing.

## Tegus Client
Got it. And which were those two?

## Former Senior Manager, Commercial Strategy at Veeva Systems Inc
Those were Veeva Align and Veeva Events management.

## Tegus Client
Great. But you're familiar with the entire portfolio? In commercial?

## Former Senior Manager, Commercial Strategy at Veeva Systems Inc
Yes. In commercial, so I also had a role in commercial where I looked after what was known as the commercial cloud for smaller customers, so non-enterprise, known as SMB market segment. So I had to have familiarity across all of the different products. And I know Veeva's clinical suite a little bit because I'm now operating in that area.

But I haven't had hands-on experience with those products like I have with the commercial, but I would also say the way Veeva develops its products, my experience for the commercial is a little out of date now it being coming up to four years since I was involved closely. So I'm sure they've moved on since then as well.

## Tegus Client
Yes, definitely. Okay. And maybe to that point, how closely do you still follow the company? It sounds like you're sort of tangentially still in the space, maybe you're even like a customer at your new company.

## Former Senior Manager, Commercial Strategy at Veeva Systems Inc
Not so much. So in my last company, we were building a partnership with Veeva. In my new company, I haven't had any contact with them. No, I'm not close with them, and they don't operate in my space or segment as yet, but you cannot operate in this market without following Veeva closely. They are the leader. I follow Veeva closely in the industry. If we're having this call three years ago, my knowledge would be more current. But again, I can still give you a good flavor and help you understand the business, how it operates and the markets that it's going after and how it goes after them.

## Tegus Client
Yes. Okay. All right. Great. So why don't we start then it makes sense to start with the commercial platform. And I guess, like at a very high level, what I'm trying to figure out about sort of the commercial cloud is basically Veeva clearly has a dominant market position. They had it at the time you left as well. I think we talked about sort of 80% of sales reps in the life sciences industry use Veeva's core CRM product.

And now there are a number of add-on modules that they can then increasingly sell to those customers. And then maybe this was sort of came more to the fore since you've left, but they've got now more data offerings across data cloud, et cetera. So basically, just trying to figure out how much growth is really left given that it seems like they almost have a footprint in every large sort of pharmaceutical company already and sort of, to the extent you can kind of talk through that, that would be great.

## Former Senior Manager, Commercial Strategy at Veeva Systems Inc
Yes, certainly. I mean I remember at the time I was there; we were going after the last sort of big beasts that hadn't in Europe that hadn't moved on to Veeva CRM. And over the last few years, I think most of them, they were like six or seven companies that moved over to Veeva, made the switch to the platform from legacy solutions, and that was where a lot of the big growth was.

So my view is that it's unlikely that we will see big CRM seat growth, as you say, the penetration is super high, where Veeva could see good growth on that side of things is better penetration of smaller market segments, SMB, particularly in Europe where the market is very fragmented. So companies will have different solutions in different countries. They haven't invested in them for a long time.

There aren't a lot of good, smaller players in CRM, unlike traditional CRM or CRM that you and I probably use, so there's still opportunity there for Veeva to go after, and they've restructured as far as I'm aware, they restructured their go-to-market in Europe to sort of take into account those more mop-up accounts where there still is an opportunity for decent growth. So what I would say is it's different to when you're able to take on, it's the old 80%-20%. 80% of the market sits in the top 20 pharma companies in terms of reps.

The other dynamic in commercial, which I think is hurting a lot of companies is that there's a potential reduction in the salesforce expected. So that sort of total seat market will decline because a lot of pharma companies are taking their reps online or shifting their model. It used to be back in 2010 to 2015, the model was known as reach and frequency, hit as many, get in front of as many physicians as possible and speak to them as much as possible, and that would be obviously like a one-to-one relationship between that and your sales.

That started to shift. COVID accelerated that trend to more of a, let's say it is a multichannel, that's a buzzword. You see a lots in the industry, multichannel or omnichannel marketing approach rather than sort of rep-lead sales. I think that's hiding a movement to more targeted sales. So sales like MSLs, some Medical Science Liaison treatment to get more complicated.

So I think that's an area where there's growth relative to the decline in the number of traditional sales reps, which brings up the sort of the bulk of the seats but also, I'm seeing pharma companies sort of redeploy them as well. So that's one dynamic that sort of movement to more online movement to marketing movement to remote detailing, it's called when you're sharing sort of information about a new drug.

On the other hand, pharma is low to get out of that too much. They like it. It's safe, it's familiar. But I do think you're seeing that reduction in seat volume and the high penetration that Veeva has, I think, capped the growth in that side of the business. Hence, the significant investment in other products, add-on products,

digital products, and data products. And I think that's where I would anticipate the growth to be. So the CRM seats for me, I think, are or just the market trend is in favor and the penetration is so high, as you said, that it's probably the investment in the data offerings, I should say, that are probably the most critical drivers of Veeva's growth.

## Tegus Client
Yes. Okay. That makes a lot of sense. And so then maybe why don't we start with some of the add-on offerings? So it sounds like you worked into them specifically, but I guess some other big ones that they talk about are Veeva Engage that, I guess, was pretty popular during the pandemic, and maybe these benefits from more of an online or omnichannel focus, but the Approved Email or PromoMats or some of those things. Like if you could talk through the add-ons and maybe just comment.

## Former Senior Manager, Commercial Strategy at Veeva Systems Inc
Absolutely. Yes. This is my area of specialty, so happy to talk about it. So you have to see, of course, CRM product, which is super powerful, built on Salesforce. Then you have all of these other products that are around it. One I looked after was Veeva Align. This is a territory management system, but it's also the way in which you can apply targets and sort of quotas and comp plans and so on to your salesforce.

So if you're moving from something more traditional and more field based, so people going and speaking to physicians, it's something more remote. That's a very powerful tool to help you sort of shift the balance of what conversations you're having. The other one on top is CRM Events Management, events in this case are when you are having a conversation with multiple physicians or a physician, you're managing a live event or a virtual event.

The reason why this product was so popular, particularly in Europe, is that there's a compliance element around it. It's a necessity. You need to track who's at the event? And also if you're paying any physicians honoraria to speak on your behalf, that all has to be reported centrally to regulators in Europe. So that was a real pull to that event.

And I think that continued in COVID because it's got a live, a virtual event sort of platform that sits on top that's also linked to the Engage platform, and that's the remote meetings piece. That took off in lockdown. I saw some of the graphs and some of the data in terms of, that Veeva had published online in terms of the number of remote meetings. It was interesting. Before that, before the pandemic, this product hasn't really caught fire.

Pharma companies were sort of low to using it. I remember it was quite a hard sell. It's interesting how things changed. I think that's one that's been really, really strong. Approved Email is sort of one that actually sits across all of these because you're sending content in an approved way, regulated way to physicians, but that's how you can send an event invite or a remote detailed link in all of those other pieces that are linked to it.

So Approved Email, that e-mail functionality sits behind it all. One thing that's worth raising as well is that Veeva redid their interface about three years ago to something called Sunrise that moves from something a lot older, and plane, and less user friendly to something a lot nicer looking so they sort of kept pace. One of the key platforms that sits behind it is Vault and PromoMats, which sort of has the content management system.

That was one that, especially with the acquisition of Zinc Ahead, which was five or six years ago now, but customers have been forced to move off Zinc and move on to PromoMats. So I think there aren't any other competing solutions that I'm aware of in use at multiple pharma for managing compliance and regulatory content called MLR, Medical Legal Review of content that's going to physicians. So that's a really sort of big, big part of the whole commercial cloud that's sort of separate to the CRM that is a huge area.

I think like the CRM, I think that growth is topping out because everyone is using it already. And the products that I was talking about, Events Management, Align, I was part of the team who did that, seven years ago now that we did that. So they are sort of more mature products now. They're not sort of new add-ons. The newer products are more in the data space. So OpenData, if you're familiar with that, that's like the book of

all the customer details and customer profiles.

## Tegus Client
Maybe quickly sort of the pricing on the core CRM relative to the pricing of each of these add-ons. Could you sort of remember how that worked? Was it kind of per seat basis maybe?

## Former Senior Manager, Commercial Strategy at Veeva Systems Inc
Yes, it's all per seat per user per month. And I would say it's roughly, depending on the product, it will range between 1/5 to 1/3 per seat of the price of the core CRM, and it's per seat per user.

## Tegus Client
Got it. And the core CRM is like ballpark like $100 a month per seat?

## Former Senior Manager, Commercial Strategy at Veeva Systems Inc
Depending, yes. Depending on the volume and the customer and all of those other things. That's the thing. It's a bit of a volume-based model. But yes, I'd say if those are your assumptions, they're roughly correct.

## Tegus Client
And so basically, if you sold a customer, all of the add-ons, putting data aside for a second, that you could double the Veeva seats or more?

## Former Senior Manager, Commercial Strategy at Veeva Systems Inc
I think it was slightly more. So because you had your core CRM, but then you had Events, Align, Engage, there are other products Approved Email. You typically bundle data into that as well. And I think you've done the adding in PromoMats, which is more like a half CRM. So it quickly added up.

And I think one of the other pieces that people tend to sort of forget about with Veeva is the services, the services are a real huge component. And as the implementation has got more complicated and broader, the value of the services component sort of increased the margins of those remain steady.

Now you would only have that in the first year or two, but you'd also have managed services as well and then moving into more of the consulting, the business services too, which sort of is a more sort of sustainable revenue stream rather than just the implementation, but the services were always a key component of deal size and was profitable. They were always delivered at a profit.

## Tegus Client
The services business?

## Former Senior Manager, Commercial Strategy at Veeva Systems Inc
Yes, yes.

## Tegus Client
Okay. Got it. So you could potentially double maybe even triple the value of the seat. So are they all add-ons to the CRM. So in other words, only selling the add-ons to the sales force of a pharmaceutical company? Or would some of those things apply to like business users outside of the sales team?

## Former Senior Manager, Commercial Strategy at Veeva Systems Inc
So that's a really good question. I would say the value can sit across multiple different parts of the enterprise. So the alignment tool is going to be sold to the sales team, the events management, a key buyer with regulatory, but you wouldn't be necessarily adding in costs or pricing for those business users, you would maintain the pricing on the core CRM licenses.

So your buyer would start to shift across the customer, we wouldn't necessarily, at the time I was there,

would still charge it based on the number of seats or reps that you had, that may have changed. But that was the sort of the model before. So it's still based on that. The one that is different is PromoMats, where you're not doing that based on seats, you're doing that based on the number of people in the content management organization and marketing teams.

## Tegus Client
Got it. Okay. So then it sounds generally a fair way to think about the revenue opportunity in core CRM and the add-ons is basically total number of sales reps in the pharmaceutical industry x maybe $300 rough math per seat per month?

## Former Senior Manager, Commercial Strategy at Veeva Systems Inc
Yes, that would be a good way to get a rough TAM. I'd add a flex to it because you're missing out on PromoMats there. So I would add just a10% to 20% uplift on top of everything because the number of marketing teams tends to scale with the number of marketing users tends to scale with the size of the salesforce. So the content requirements, say, which scales in line with the complexity of the portfolio that a pharma company has. They all tend to scale with each other. But yes, I'd say that would be an easy way, good top-down way of doing it.

## Tegus Client
Got it. And do you know roughly the number of sales people, I think Veeva has given this number in the past, but.

## Former Senior Manager, Commercial Strategy at Veeva Systems Inc
Not off the top of my head. No, I can't remember. I can't remember anymore, but there are lots of infographics out there. I think it will have changed a lot over the last three years. I think it would be interesting to that data, I think it would have declined by at least 10% to 20%.

## Tegus Client
Yes, I think I'm seeing like 100,000, I don't know if that's correct.

## Former Senior Manager, Commercial Strategy at Veeva Systems Inc
That feels low to me. I think it's slightly low. I mean, I don't think you're off by a factor of two, but don't forget, if you can get a figure for the U.S., the rough way I thought about it before, was that U.S. is 1/3 to 1/2 of the market. Europe is 1/3 and then rest of the world is the rest, so typically you could probably make it 1/3, 1/3, 1/3.

## Tegus Client
So Europe as second third?

## Former Senior Manager, Commercial Strategy at Veeva Systems Inc
Yes. So U.S., Europe, and then rest of the world, but I would probably bump U.S. higher and sort of take, but you basically, if you got a figure for the U.S. multiply it by three, you won't be too far off. The value of each of those reps to a company like Veeva is very different. You're going to be able to charge a very different price for a rep in Germany and the U.S. than you offer a rep in India or China.

Now don't forget, so that's important point, the pricing a rep because how much are pharma companies are willing to invest in their rep in, let's say, Bulgaria or Serbia and the price they're willing to pay versus a specialty rep in the U.S. It's going to be very, very different. And so you have to factor that into your TAM model. The other piece is you may have parts of the world like India, where you have huge numbers of reps, but actually, you could only really charge 10% of what you could elsewhere and also, they're less like it's just those industry-specific markets are important.

The other piece is that you're not just thinking about pharmaceutical sales reps. We also got to think about med tech and consumer health. So GSK spitting off their consumer health industry, but there are consumer

and also animal health to Zoetis. So you've got those markets, too, that Veeva can sit. But I think if you took the figure of sales reps multiplied it by three, I would be comfortable that, I would be taking into account those other additional markets. But if you were looking to do something more detailed, it's not just pharma. Animal health is important.

## Tegus Client
Okay. The number I'm seeing now for U.S. looks like 80,000, so maybe 240,000 is closer globally.

## Former Senior Manager, Commercial Strategy at Veeva Systems Inc
Yes. I'd give that a 10% haircut, and I would say that would cover all potential markets. And I think that would be a safe assumption. Yes, it sounds about right.

## Tegus Client
Yes. It looks like it sounds like a $1 billion revenue opportunity. That's something more than that.

## Former Senior Manager, Commercial Strategy at Veeva Systems Inc
Well, the real huge opportunity is in the R&D side. That's where the massive TAMs are. That sounds about right, I remember the talks at Veeva when I was there, that we have a clear focused goal of getting to this at the time with just CRM and a couple of products, $500 million TAM for CRM. I think we've all been swayed in the last 10 years of seeing SaaS companies talk about their TAMs as being trillions of dollars.

I think Veeva had a clear view to win 80% of the $400 million, a clear path to winning and then growing that market from $400 million to $1 billion by adding in additional products is a good approach. The real huge TAM is in the R&D space where it's between $6 billion to $20 billion is spent on software for R&D or potentially more.

The decentralized clinical trials market is tracking to something like $18 billion per year. So that's where the huge opportunities are. But what Veeva did, I think it's interesting because we always look at the TAMs that you see from modern SaaS, and it tends to be something that I feel is quite inflated. Veeva has always had a very focused one and they won it, so.

## Tegus Client
Yes. Let's talk a little bit about four competitive dynamics, why don't we cover data within Commercial Cloud and then maybe a bit on R&D.

## Former Senior Manager, Commercial Strategy at Veeva Systems Inc
Yes. Data is the one that I'm a little bit softer on because a lot of this came in since I left. But there's sort of four products in that area. OpenData was a huge area of investment while I was there. That was the database of every single physician in the world. So imagine you turn on your CRM and I've got amazing data. I can just go and find the right people and know that if I phone them or knock on the door, I know who they are and it's up to date.

And if anything changes, if anything updates, it's there. Huge competitive play versus IMS at the time who became IQVIA and that sets within network, which was a master data management solution, which never quite fired, never quite took off, but was a neat thing. Around about the time I joined, customers had a lot of problems with the data quality within the CRM, and that's why Veeva invested heavily in this area.

The next area was Veeva Link. While I was at Veeva, I remember the acquisition that led to this product area, that's focused on finding specialty like key opinion leaders that are high-value targets and having a lot more information about them. I do not know how this product is going or what its reception has been. It was in development while I was at Veeva.

The other piece is Nitro, which is the insights and analytics platform that sits across. Again, I don't know how this is going. But I think it's not going. It's not taking off. I think they're having challenges with competitive actions to access the insight to surface that. And that was one of the challenges that we always had was

around analytics. So it's interesting if Veeva built something on top of that, but I don't know how the uptake of that is going. I don't know how mature that product is.

## Tegus Client
Got it. And when you say competitive action, you're talking about the lawsuit with IQVIA?

## Former Senior Manager, Commercial Strategy at Veeva Systems Inc
Correct. Yes. That gummed up a lot of action, I think, on both sides and led to a slowdown in innovation, I think, for the industry.

## Tegus Client
Yes. And I guess Crossix. The Crossix acquisition was done after you left?

## Former Senior Manager, Commercial Strategy at Veeva Systems Inc
I don't know on that one, again, this is very much more U.S. focused, in terms of the data set they had. I hadn't come across any customers using Crossix in Europe in my time there, but I'm sure the technology that goes into that is behind some of the Link and Nitro and other pieces, but it happened after I left.

## Tegus Client
Got it. And how do you think about how big the opportunity is in across all those data offerings?

## Former Senior Manager, Commercial Strategy at Veeva Systems Inc
I think it's really sizable. The question mark I have is let's say, I'm a huge a massive top 10 pharma company, and I'm paying just on the commercial side, many tens of millions, will I pay that again to access data? Or would I expect to have that cheaper to keep me on the platform? Then the question I have is I don't doubt it's value to customers. What I challenge in terms of thinking is, will customers have the marginal willingness to pay for that on top of whatever they're paying already for the software. So I think the market opportunity is there. It's huge. But I don't know if the fact you have to have the full Veeva platform to take advantage of it, is a barrier to adoption? And if you think about it, I wouldn't buy that for use with another CRM.

So if I've got a market offering that is analytics insights that I can use across any CRM, across any platform that I have as a company, and I might be using one platform in the U.S., one platform in Europe, another platform in Asia Pac, then what do I choose? Do I go for what's going to work best? But I do think there's a significant opportunity, but the fact is that it's tied to all of the CRM and the software. So I wonder the willingness to pay on top. Will my total cost of ownership 3x, 4x and can they try better as a pharma company?

## Tegus Client
Got it. So you're saying they can't really sell these data offerings unless you're using Veeva's core CRM and so if you're using, I don't know, some other CRM like Oracle or Salesforce, then you like that's an opportunity.

## Former Senior Manager, Commercial Strategy at Veeva Systems Inc
Correct. Yes, it will be only for use with Veeva.

## Tegus Client
Right. And if you think from a customer perspective that you might not want sort of vendor lock in, so like you might do like a best-of-breed approach where you use IQVIA for your data stuff, so that gives you flexibility on the CRM side?

## Former Senior Manager, Commercial Strategy at Veeva Systems Inc
Exactly. If I'm using OpenData, I don't know what it's called OneKey data, then I cannot use the network or Nitro solution. So I would probably just be using a third party in any case. And then if I've had this problem

for three, four years, I have probably invested in a solution that will last another five. So have I, as a customer already invested to solve this problem?

## Tegus Client
Yes. Okay. I guess just stepping back for a second. What other CRMs are popular in life sciences?

## Former Senior Manager, Commercial Strategy at Veeva Systems Inc
So I think it's changed since I was closer to it, in that time, OCE by IQVIA has been released. That did well at the start, but it seemed to fall away. I think there were a few other niche providers that we would tend to see in Europe. But again, none of them got the traction I thought they would. So I still don't think there's the closest competitor is the IQVIA one. They bought the biggest competitor, which was Cegedim. But again, they then try to move customers to OCE, which hasn't quite taken off. It's doing well.

But when I've spoken to any people in the market, to me it's kind of like-for-like or quite similar. So it's like do you prefer blue or do you prefer orange. I don't quite believe that. I think Veeva has a better whole product and a better ecosystem around it. It's much easier to find people that can work on a Veeva solution, a Veeva System than those who can work on the OCE one. But again, I don't think that's the closest competitor. And I don't know if it's market share has taken off as much as people thought it would.

## Tegus Client
Yes. Okay. And the competitive landscape on the data side, is that really like predominantly IQVIA?

## Former Senior Manager, Commercial Strategy at Veeva Systems Inc
Yes, it's IQVIA. They're almost a data monopoly. I think Veeva is the first sustained challenge the industry is seeing. And the biggest one is pricing, like the sales data. So that's the sort of the hidden piece that IQVIA has or is not so hidden, but they have the sales data. Now there are other providers that are starting to figure that out, Veeva being one of them. I think Crossix helps, but it's the sales data, how much of your products are you selling? That's particularly in Europe, so hard to get that.

## Tegus Client
So the sales data, they basically get through like the pharmacy network. It's the prescription window, right?

## Former Senior Manager, Commercial Strategy at Veeva Systems Inc
Yes. But in Europe, there's a particular thing called a brick. I don't know if you're familiar with this. I would just spend 30 seconds on that because it's confusing, but it gives you an idea of the moats that IQVIA have there in Europe, is there's a thing called a brick. A brick is a combination, geographical sort of location that contains three to seven pharmacies. Why three to seven? So you cannot attribute the sales to any particular hospital or physician. So it's blended.

So in the U.S., I can see that Dr. James has prescribed x amount of this drug and why amount of that drug. I can't see that in Europe. I just have to see rough relative trends blended. So I'm slightly obscured by it. That's a regulatory or legislation that exists in Europe. IQVIA have those bricks or proprietary IQVIA structure that they've been selling to the market for over 30 years.

And they're really hot, you cannot sort of back calculate them, they change them all time. And so they've got a really good moat in Europe on sales data because I've set up my compensation, I've set up everything based on these bricks and so to get something new and to wean a customer off that when they've been doing, having a data source in a particular format for 30 years is very difficult.

## Tegus Client
And I mean, can you just explain exactly what the data is? So you're not just looking for there's sort of drug, I don't know, like Lipitor and like it basically gives me Lipitor sales by geography or you want the granularity of exactly what doctor at what hospital is prescribing a certain amount of Lipitor, like what is exactly the process?

## Former Senior Manager, Commercial Strategy at Veeva Systems Inc
Yes. So maybe it's chase. But on some other markets, you can get the exact amount that the U.S. doctor is prescribing over time. Can't do that in Europe, you might get it at a hospital level or at a geographic level. So you cannot go, hey, Dr. James, I see that you're not prescribing as much of our product as you were before? You can't have that direct conversation. And so the sales data is they're the only one that can go that one level below in Europe, the sort of subnational level sales information by geographic area and that geographic area is defined by IQVIA. So they've got a wonderful solution, sort of moat there. It's called a brick.

## Tegus Client
And so how is Veeva going to get that information?

## Former Senior Manager, Commercial Strategy at Veeva Systems Inc
That, I don't know. And I don't know if they're trying to or I don't know if they can back calculate with it, create a new methodology to calculate this, create new partnerships. That would be a long-term play. It would be a very good long-term play, but I don't know if it's one they're making or not. I don't know if Veeva sells those data.

## Tegus Client
No, I think they're working on getting that into Data Cloud.

## Former Senior Manager, Commercial Strategy at Veeva Systems Inc
Yes. Yes, absolutely. They must be. But I just wanted to give you an example of like that's a really big asset that IQVIA has and that's what's slowing down some of those data products. If Veeva can unlock that and get brick equivalent data in there, they would absolutely fly.

## Tegus Client
Got it. But so it sounds like the prescriber data, or the sales data is the most proprietary, whereas like I've heard from a lot of these other companies that basically the Medicare claims data is publicly available. So it's just a matter of kind of getting that and using AI to like clean it and present it properly?

## Former Senior Manager, Commercial Strategy at Veeva Systems Inc
But getting that for Europe and other nations, where you're getting 2/3 of your sales. Especially, I think Japan, you can get good data, and that's a huge market. Yes, that's the same with China, just not in U.S. Yes.

## Tegus Client
But out of essence, what the data offerings are across all the things that you described, it's sort of granular data on what are the hospitals, what are the revenue of the hospitals? Who are the physicians? What are they prescribing? All of that, so that the salesforce at a pharma company makes, has informed information around like what calls to make to what doctors essentially?

## Former Senior Manager, Commercial Strategy at Veeva Systems Inc
Exactly. And how to sell in to those hospitals and formularies. So the relationships between the different physicians, who the key opinion leader is, what are his or her links to other pharma companies based on that's where the Veeva Link comes in because you'll see how tied they are to different pharma companies. Because of their research portfolio.

## Tegus Client
Yes. And maybe this is a silly question, but like why isn't there a lot more that Veeva can do on the marketing side? Like if I'm just thinking about Salesforce right, they have Health Cloud, which is the core CRM and then they have sort of like Marketing Cloud, which is sort of circling on marketing, yes.

## Former Senior Manager, Commercial Strategy at Veeva Systems Inc
Yes. You can't really market. So you can't really market drugs in the same way. So there is integration with

Salesforce Marketing Cloud, Pardot, all of these things. You have those. So even never thought they needed to build them, they could partner with Salesforce to make that work. But the uptake from customers was never great. I think it's because they can't market in the same way as other sort of more consumer-based companies.

One is they can only market to physicians. So they can advertise a bit in the U.S. and New Zealand, but not in other nations. So there's no point in investing into sort of leads and all of that sort of stuff. But I just think it's traditionally for the industry, I don't think it's a Veeva issue that there's an opportunity there that they haven't gone into.

The industry doesn't think like that the pharma industry, they think of it very much as a B2B sales channel. And bear in mind, there's so much regulation in how you can talk to physicians that it becomes quite difficult, they're not going to send flyers through; I don't think they are allowed to do that, at least not in Europe. They're not even allowed to give branded pens or any giveaways anymore. That's how sort of clamped down it is. So I think it's an industry and regulation piece rather than a sort of Veeva missing opportunity piece.

## Tegus Client
I guess at the start of the call, we talked about sort of how the pandemic has accelerated the move away from more of this direct in-person sales to more omnichannel. And so then basically, my question then is why doesn't Veeva have an opportunity to digitize the like omnichannel selling motion? And then what did you mean by omnichannel?

## Former Senior Manager, Commercial Strategy at Veeva Systems Inc
Yes. So I think the way that Veeva are sort of thinking about it is, and I think you're seeing some competitors come up in this area as well. Things like tapped AI and other ones, what they want to do is help pharma companies, what pharma companies are trying to do is to say no matter how an HCP wants to communicate with us, at our pharma company, we will give them the channel to do it, whether they want to watch a webinar, whether they want to read on paper, whether they want to access all of these different pieces.

I think what they found is that the HCPs didn't really reach out to them that much unless it was to speak to Medical Scientific Liaison, so the deeper technical people within a pharma company. So they just carried on pushing. But there is a move to sort of create a way for physicians to sort of reach out to pharma and get the information they need rather than pharma always pushing. But I don't know how successful that's been.

And that's where we mean omnichannel. So whether it's something to speak with or they send a message or they send an e-mail or they access this content online or so on and so forth, those sorts of digital channels, but it seems that everything is still orchestrated through the rep. And I think your challenge is a good one. I don't know enough about how this industry is moving to see if that's something that is really taking off.

Or if actually some of the software providers are staying sort of rep driven because that's where the opportunity is, the growth is. But I'm seeing a few sorts of companies bubble up around finding out where patients are and targeting and being smarter in this way, but I'm not seeing much investment in automating pharma go-to-market like you have done in other sort of sales categories.

## Tegus Client
Crossix is sort of that, right, I mean, I'm just looking at it more now. It looks like it's basically data for marketing and targeting across media channels, right? So it's essentially marketing analytics?

## Former Senior Manager, Commercial Strategy at Veeva Systems Inc
Potentially, but that I think if you're talking about in the U.S., you could market to patients. You have another channel that you can go to market with, and you need to know that's a huge amount of spend, and you probably need to know how that is? Whether that's being effective or not? You don't have that channel in Europe. You can't have any conversation with patients at all. So there's less need to invest in that.

So maybe I'm answering it from too much of a European perspective. But there aren't a lot of marketing channels that you can do apart from going to a hospital or going to HCP. I would be interested to see if

anybody is using Crossix or Crossix information outside of the U.S. That I don't know.

Because then there is an opportunity, or they've bought Crossix three years ago pre-COVID, and it's still not in use across the globe, which kind of tells you that maybe is a U.S. market specific opportunity. But I just don't know. It's a really good question, though. I can't give you more on it.

## Tegus Client
Yes. Okay. So why don't we talk on the R&D side? It sounds like that's where a lot of the opportunity is. Can you kind of just talk through sort of whatever you know best from that perspective?

## Former Senior Manager, Commercial Strategy at Veeva Systems Inc
Sure. So on the R&D side, there's a few different areas. So I'm not going to talk about the regulatory or the quality or the safety side or so they've put a lot there. So there's things like Veeva Safety, Veeva Vault Safety, which helps record adverse events. You've got quality documentation. I was a customer of that in one of my previous companies and other things as well for labs or process management.

There's regulatory stuff for submitting stuff to regulatory, while all of them have a similar idea, where there's documentation workflow that needs to be managed. On the clinical side, which is probably the side I'm closest to, you've got sort of two different types of things or three different types of things, two are more mature than the third. One is clinical operations, which is stuff like that these are the products that are used to run all clinical trials.

So you've got things like eTMF, electronic trial master file, which is your massive book of all of this content that you need for the trial that's kept an up-to-date and approved and everybody is looking at the latest version, stuff for managing trial monitoring from sort of investigators in clinical trial monitors. And then you've got things to capture data on the trial like EDC, the Electronic Data Capture, and there's lots of sort of areas around that. So I'm a physician at site. I'm using, I'm taking blood from a patient, I'm seeing the results.

I need to enter that into a system that's highly, highly regulated by the trusted data, this needs to be set up in a particular way. And then you've got the third area, which is decentralized trials and Veeva announced that they're going hard into that space to build a platform for that. And there's a lot of competitors in that space, Science 37, Medable, it has THREAD, it has Clario, Signant Health. This is a huge market. It's growing out of the ePRO market. That's a market I know quite well.

The ePRO market, I estimated had a market sizing of $1.5 billion in 2020 and was growing 15% year-on-year. So that gives you an idea of the size of just that specific market segment versus commercial. These market sizes are absolutely ginormous. You've also got Veeva's approach on research sites. So they are putting in place functionality that helps research sites manage their documentation, their content, their information, and they're giving that to research sites, I think, at no additional cost or for free so that it's sort of seeding the market for their approach.

I think that's a very good long-term play, so that all of the research sites are using a Veeva infrastructure, and then they will get asked by sponsors to use whatever software the sponsor wants to use, but they'll have a bit of a Veeva infrastructure underneath. It seems like a really interesting idea.

But the real sort of opportunity is Veeva has been investing in EDC for a long time. And the next big thing, I can imagine, for them would be on the decentralized trial space, where they're making a huge investment. And they've just launched their e-consent platform, which is sort of the first prong of this and they're releasing their ePRO later this year. So that's where the significant investment is going in.

## Tegus Client
Okay. And so just to make sure I understand all of this. So EDC is what exactly?

## Former Senior Manager, Commercial Strategy at Veeva Systems Inc
It's doctors input, let's imagine physicians, doctors putting in data at a trial site about the clinical trial. And ePRO is a patient putting data in about the trial. But then you've got other forms of eSource, which eSource

is sort of anybody putting data in electronically. Reason why they put 'E' in front of everything because up until 15 years ago, everything was still on paper. So that's why they like to put the E in front of things, ePRO, Electronic Patient Reported Outcome; eCOA, Electronic Clinical Outcome Assessment. That's often when a physician is entering data. It's slightly different to EDC, but they all tend to be linked.

All of these are mechanisms for capturing all of the information about the trial in a single place, including the results so that you can just submit. And then Veeva has the infrastructure to help you submit that to regulatory authorities. The amount of paper and admin, infrastructure and project management in the clinical trial is absolutely ginormous.

The way to think about these are as if they are some of the biggest projects being done in the world, a Phase III can cost $700 million to run over five years. They're massive infrastructure projects and Veeva builds the infrastructure to help people run that. I think that's where their longer-term, bigger market opportunity is and their growth, that's where I think where the growth will come from, particularly on EDC side.

## Tegus Client
Got it. And who is the buyer for EDC? Is it the sponsor or it's the site?

## Former Senior Manager, Commercial Strategy at Veeva Systems Inc
It's sponsor or CROs. So CROs, contract research organizations. Either CROs will buy the software upfront from Veeva or something like that and then say, sponsors will run your trial costs us this much. And the sponsors just don't care what they use as long as the trial gets done, so they can use any of the providers or you sell to the sponsor and the sponsor says make sure you use Veeva and they might have a contract in place, and we've got a preferred rate or commitment or so on and so forth.

So it comes from both two angles and then it goes to the site to use. So if you can imagine being this is where one of the areas, that's why Veeva is investing in sites. As a site, I could be doing 10 trials with three different platforms at once. So that's where investing in site infrastructure for Veeva gives them an edge if sites prefer them, but you sell to buyer, is a sponsor, or CRO typically, and all of the money flows from sponsors at the end of the day, everything comes from them, even the CRO money comes from the sponsor.

## Tegus Client
Got it. And the eTMF and CTMS products, those are sold to the same buyers?

## Former Senior Manager, Commercial Strategy at Veeva Systems Inc
Yes. Yes, typically, and the buyers are clinical operations. I'm not so clear on eTMF and CTMS, I've never sold those products or being that close to them. But typically, sponsors will because if there's still the CRO will log in and use the software that the sponsor has if they pre-bought it.

## Tegus Client
Yes. So a couple of questions, is there an advantage if customers are already using safety, quality, or regulatory to using the clinical suite? Yes.

## Former Senior Manager, Commercial Strategy at Veeva Systems Inc
Yes, absolutely. There's wonderful synergy between all of these. It's really nice, like the breadth of the suite is good. That's where I think the bubble up growth that Veeva sold came from. The TAMs of this are bigger in my view than the commercial TAM, and the products are good. And they're actually fighting against was also the newer Veeva's products here are newer in a strange way that the CRM is older. So here, they've got more of a technology advantage as well.

## Tegus Client
Got it. And in which of these products are they the leader. It's usually everything except EDC?

## Former Senior Manager, Commercial Strategy at Veeva Systems Inc

ETMF, CTMS, RIM. So that's the RIM Suite quality, they're gaining. I'd say they probably are now QMS. And safety, I'd say, is an emerging leadership. But I'd say that now they've got a good leadership position across that. EDC is up for debate. I don't know. I'd say no, but if you ask them, they'll say yes.

## Tegus Client
And who are the big competitors?

## Former Senior Manager, Commercial Strategy at Veeva Systems Inc
Oracle, Medidata, IBM for a time. And there's a lot of different ones. I would say maybe that is probably the biggest one.

## Tegus Client
Got it. Okay. This is really the biggest opportunity?

## Former Senior Manager, Commercial Strategy at Veeva Systems Inc
Yes. But there's other emerging ones as well that are starting to sort of take a bit of lunch like Castor EDC. But yes, I would say, Oracle, Medidata are probably some of the best.

## Tegus Client
How big do you think the market is just for EDC?

## Former Senior Manager, Commercial Strategy at Veeva Systems Inc
Oh, I don't know. Bigger than CRM would be my guess. I don't know specifically. But I'd say my view is that it's bigger, but I'd also say the clinical market spaces are growing but I also think they're generally overestimated. And so it's a bit of that. But I think they're pretty big. I'd say EDC is bigger than CRM. I would say EDC is bigger than commercial. I'd say, clinical is bigger than commercial though. EDC and CRM, maybe a more comparable market, maybe slightly bigger. If you look at, I'd say clinical bigger than commercial for sure.

## Tegus Client
Got it. All right. Awesome. So I think we're pretty much up on time. But if you have another minute, my last question is just, what are the risks that you would be worried about as a sort of investor in Veeva, what are the things that you think could be sort of a challenge?

## Former Senior Manager, Commercial Strategy at Veeva Systems Inc
I would say both the technical moat, the technical moat has built up over time. I think technical moats always get more difficult to sustain as the company gets older and more mature, I would say, keeping talent. They're a big established company that's bubbled up to the top. So keeping their talent and attracting other industry talent. I'd say it's probably the biggest focus. And I'd say emerging players that they haven't heard of yet, I think there's so much money being invested in this space. I'd say, in fact, if they don't keep on top of the technical trends and invest in their platform, I think they could be outcompeted in five to 10 years by a new entrant into the market. And I think that will compound if they don't hold on to key talent. The war of talent is so big.

## Tegus Client
It sounds like you're not worried about the growth opportunity because R&D overall in clinical is still so big.

## Former Senior Manager, Commercial Strategy at Veeva Systems Inc
I think they're big, but I also think the risk for Veeva is that they price themselves out of the market. If Veeva decided to be super aggressive and capture the market, they can blow away a lot of the competition, but I still think they remain quite an expensive choice. So I think that's a challenge for them. But I do think the biggest risk for them is executing on that opportunity. The opportunity is there, but a lot of people can see the opportunity.

And so the technical moat to ensure that it's still best to have everything on Veeva needs to be there and they need to make it easier to implement and get it started. And I think they'll do a lot of products. So there's always the focus challenge. If someone is taking a best-of-breed yet integrated approach, is that still Veeva?

## Tegus Client
Yes. And then just last thing. Are there synergies between R&D and commercial?

## Former Senior Manager, Commercial Strategy at Veeva Systems Inc
Not as many as you think when you look at it from the outside, is my short answer. There are strong rules between these, and you can see this in biotech, where you have companies that don't have a clinical asset, they just develop the asset and then sell it to companies that do have a commercial. So companies that don't have a commercial play. That's a fine business model. The commercial people don't talk to the R&D people and vice versa.

R&D people very scientific, administrative, commercial people. It's a bit like oil and water. That's my view. At the very top of the company, they start to combine. But even then, if you're speaking to the person that runs the oncology business unit at a major pharma, they might not know too much about how the nuts and bolts of the trial operations. They just know more about the sort of the broader swings of it, so even at the very top, it's kept quite separate. So there's less synergy than you think. I don't know if that's a good thing or bad thing, but it's just the way the market works. It's not like a tech company.

## Tegus Client
Yes. Interesting. Well this has been super helpful, thanks again for the time.
