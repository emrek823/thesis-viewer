## Slide 1: Next Generation Healthcare NLP is Here

Next Generation Healthcare
NLP is Here
Eliminate the manual work needed to make healthcare data
ready to be searched, analyzed, and mined for insights.

## Slide 2: Bad Data Leads to Uninformed Decisions

80%
of healthcare
data is
unstructured
* Discharge summaries
* Progress notes
* Physician clinical notes
* Lab reports
* Socioeconomic data
* Medical images
* Faxed records

### Bad Data Leads to Uninformed Decisions

#### IMPACTS INTEROPERABILITY
~70%
of healthcare
providers still
exchange medical
information by fax
Fax remains the
primary means of
exchanging patient
information

#### RELIES ON OUTDATED LEGACY PLATFORMS
Onboarding to
traditional NLP
solutions takes
~6
months
Inflexible, No API
No real-time processing

#### EXPONENTIAL DATA GROWTH
In 2 years
digital data
volume will
exceed hospital
data.
Impossible to manually
parse
Need for technology

## Slide 3: CHALLENGES

CHALLENGES
Reliable insights require accurate
and complete patient data, but...
* Data capture at point of care is cumbersome
* Data aggregation introduces critical gaps
and inconsistencies in data
* Current approaches to data quality
are time consuming

## Slide 4: OPPORTUNITY

OPPORTUNITY

01
Expand data
usability &
intelligence

02
Automate clinical
document
abstraction

Unlock value
without draining
clinical resources

03
Maximize informed
decision-making

04
Optimize
reimbursement

ScienceIO's data enrichment solutions
integrate data from multiple health
systems, unlocking value without draining
resources.

## Slide 8: Key Use Case Examples

### KEY USE CASE
Identify
Patient Cohorts
NLP-enriched records make
it easier to find patients and
create cohorts based on
demographics, biomarkers,
conditions, procedures, and
other complex variables.

### KEY USE CASE
Create
Structured Data
Transform unstructured
notes and messages into
structured data assets that
enables analysis, real-time
reports, and alerts of critical
events.

### KEY USE CASE
Abstract Data
Automatically
Capture a patient's full
medical history through
automated abstraction of
notes, documents, and
reports.

## Slide 9: KEY USE CASE - Identify Patients & Define Cohorts

KEY USE CASE
Identify Patients & Define Cohorts
Finding patients in EHR systems is a key step in many
workflows. ScienceIO's NLP-enriched records speed up
patient matching and cohort identification for clinical
workflows and real-world studies.

### CHALLENGE
Patient data is not easily
findable and requires manual
review, which is impractical.

### SCIENCE.IO SOLUTION
ScienceIO makes records searchable
by identifying key information from
unstructured records.

## Slide 10: KEY USE CASE - Create Structured Data

KEY USE CASE
Create Structured Data
Transform unstructured notes and messages into structured
data assets that enables analysis, real-time reports,
and alerts of critical events.

### CHALLENGE
Documents can be unorganized
and overwhelming to make
sense of. Key information is
hidden amongst hundreds of
pages require a ton of manual
hours to go through.

### SCIENCE.IO SOLUTION
ScienceIO unlocks insights from
previously untapped information to
create a usable data asset.

## Slide 11: KEY USE CASE - Abstract Data Automatically

KEY USE CASE
Abstract Data Automatically
Capture a patient's full medical history through automated
abstraction of notes, documents, and reports.

### CHALLENGE
Constructing a patient's care
journey is difficult due to
unorganized and unstructured
documents.

### SCIENCE.IO SOLUTION
Clinical information extraction and
patient information identification
enables patient-centric document
classification and note abstraction.
