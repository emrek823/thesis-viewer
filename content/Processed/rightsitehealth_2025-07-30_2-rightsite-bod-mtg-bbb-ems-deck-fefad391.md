# One Big Beautiful Bill Act (BBB) Impact on 911/EMS

Georgia and Texas
Discussion Deck – BOD Meeting
August 1, 2025

**RIGHT SITE**
For non-emergency patients

## Slide 2: + Introduction to Deck

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (BBB) introduces major Medicaid reforms that are projected to significantly increase the uninsured population across both urban and rural communities. To offset the rural impact, Congress established the $50B Rural Health Transformation Fund (RHTF), providing each state up to $200M annually to improve rural access, invest in technology, and build sustainable care delivery models—including EMS and telehealth solutions.

Georgia and Texas EMS systems are already under significant strain and are expected to experience sharp increases in call volume, particularly among low-acuity 911 cases. We conservatively estimate an additional 60,000 low-acuity transports in Georgia and 145,000 in Texas each year, driven by coverage losses and increased demand from medically and socially complex patients.

As outlined in this deck, we have focused on how to position, educate, and influence state-level planning to ensure the RightSite model is both implemented and reimbursable under RHTF. A core part of this strategy includes advocating for a Treat-No-Transport (TNT) reimbursement mechanism for EMS, enabling our model to deliver sustainable cost savings while aligning directly with RHTF pillars.

RightSite remains the most cost-effective and highest quality solution to safely manage low-acuity patients—regardless of setting—while reducing strain on EMS and ED infrastructure.

## Slide 3: + Top 5 Healthcare Provisions in the BBB

| Provision | Impact | Why EMS Cares |
| :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 Medicaid cuts could be $860B with work-reporting¹ | 5-8M could lose coverage; unpaid care increases | More self-pay/uninsured 911 callers |
| 2 End of enhanced ACA tax-credits at year-end 2025² | ~ 8M priced out of the Marketplace | Marketplace exits spike = More uninsured 911 callers |
| 3 Cap on provider tax and directed payments that provided additional funding for Medicaid³ | States can't boost Medicaid rates | States can't raise EMS rates = fixed budget combined with more 911 callers |
| 4 Hospital funding (DSH) cuts resume FY 28-30⁴ | $8B/yr subsidy loss for hospitals | Hospitals lose EMS subsidy = staffing challenges = increase Wall Time likely |
| 5 Inpatient rate cap 100% / 110% Medicare⁴ | Lower hospital revenue nationwide | Increase in Hospital visits with lower revenue = staffing challenges = increase Wall Time likely |

## Slide 10: + Leveraging the RuralHealthTransformationFund (RHTF) for State-Wide EMS Telehealth and SDOH Navigation Program

*   Georgia 911 low acuity transports will increase by 60k or 12% and potentially cost $140M/yr
*   Texas 911 low acuity transports will increase by 145k or 11% and potentially cost $355M/yr
*   Evaluate RHTF funds to stand up a state-wide Telehealth and SDOH Navigation program that diverts low-acuity 911 calls from unnecessary ambulance transports and rural ED visits
*   Expected impact
    *   Reduction in low-acuity transports
    *   Meaningful Medicaid savings
    *   Reduce EMS annual crew requirements overall, allowing for greater availability for higher-acuity calls
    *   Improve rural response times

## Slide 11: + State Opportunity for EMS Participation

*   Urban-Rural Synergy:
    *   Urban Dispatch diversion reduces ED boarding and EMS off-load times in major metros, unlocking beds and staff for incoming rural patient transfers.
    *   Decreased crowding at tertiary centers means more timely acceptance of rural hospital transfers for stroke, STEMI, sepsis, and trauma—improving golden-hour outcomes.
    *   Telehealth physicians provide real-time triage to rural paramedics and rural EDs, standardizing care and mitigating rural physician shortages.
    *   KPIs to track both outbound urban diversions and inbound rural transfer acceptance rates to document balanced benefits across geographies.
*   Strategic fit with RHTF objectives:
    *   Technology
    *   Partnerships
    *   Workforce
    *   Rural Outcomes
