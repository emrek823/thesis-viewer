# Sentinel Initiative: Request for Information Sentinel 3.0 Data Hub and Scientific Support Services

## Purpose

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), and the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) request public comments to inform the future organization of the Sentinel System.

FDA seeks information that will assist in the development of new approaches to meet FDA's legal requirements, fulfill its public health mission, and add value to the Sentinel System. This information will also help to shape the next solicitation or Request for Proposal (RFP) for the Sentinel System. Specifically, FDA is interested in obtaining input from the public on the proposed Sentinel 3.0 Data Hub and Scientific Support Services structure and operations. The goal of the next Sentinel System contract is to continue meeting or exceeding the legislative requirements, promote program's efficiency, support the anticipated needs of each of the distinctive underlying Sentinel components (e.g., Active Postmarket Risk Identification and Analysis (ARIA) system¹), and ensure sufficient flexibility to address emerging safety issues and rapidly changing public health needs (e.g., public health emergencies).

## Background

The Sentinel Initiative fulfills the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act (FDAAA) of 2007 (Sec 905) requirement for an active postmarket risk identification and analysis system. FDAAA requires that FDA access disparate data sources to link and analyze safety data to cover at least 100 million U.S. patients. CDER, CBER, and CDRH developed various approaches to conduct complementary postmarket safety surveillance activities utilizing population-based data sources tailored to the regulated products under the purview of each center. The FDA is consolidating postmarket safety surveillance activities utilizing population-based data sources conducted through the Sentinel System, CBER Biologics Effectiveness and Safety (BEST) Initiative, and CDRH under the new Sentinel 3.0. The proposed new system will provide a collaborative, central framework for active surveillance activities for CDER, CBER and CDRH.

The Sentinel 3.0 will include the following components:

(1) **FDA Sentinel Coordinating Center (SCC):** The SCC will be managed by the Sentinel Core Team (SCT) in CDER's Office of Surveillance and Epidemiology (OSE), staff from CBER's Office of Biostatistics and Pharmacovigilance (OBPV) BEST initiative and select staff from CDRH's Office of Clinical Evidence and Analysis (OCEA).
(2) **Sentinel Program Management Organization (PMO):** The PMO, via a contract awarded in September 2024², provides program/project management and business informatics support services (e.g., Collaboration Platform that operates outside of FDA in a Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) cloud-based environment).
(3) **Data Hub and Scientific Support Services:** The Data Hub and Scientific Support Services (via a new contract) will provide access to:
    a. **Data Partners** (a component of the Data Hub): Provide health care data (e.g., commercial and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)) claims data, commercial claims aggregators data, claims data linked to electronic health records (EHR) data, specialty EHR Data (e.g., oncology, pediatrics, geriatrics, hospital intensive care unit (ICU)), disease or product registry or registry network data, and Health Information Exchange (HIE) Data). Data sources with the ability to link health care data to Immunization Information Systems (IIS) across the country to supplement vaccine exposure data for all vaccines and/or have access to medical device utilization data (e.g., Unique Device Identifier (UDI)) are of high importance to FDA.
    b. **Data Platform** (a component of the Data Hub): Provides artificial intelligence (AI) enabled data repository services and informatics tools and capabilities (e.g., facilitates data analysis by providing tools and terminologies to translate clinical definitions to operational definitions). The Data Platform is a contractor-operated, FedRAMP cloud-based, multi-tenant environment.
    c. **Scientific Support Services:** Provide scientific services including data analytics support (e.g., capability to conduct complex pharmacoepidemiology and pharmacovigilance studies, and advanced analytics).

To continue to meet the congressional mandate in FDAAA and maintain ongoing operations of the Sentinel System, FDA plans to award a five-year Sentinel System contract by **December 2025**. The planned contract vehicle is a multiple award, tiered Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. The IDIQ will be awarded by Tiers as follows:

*   **Tier 1:** Commercial Healthcare Insurance Claims Data
*   **Tier 2:** Commercial Healthcare Insurance Claims Data from Third-Party Aggregator(s) (access to medical records is not required)
*   **Tier 3:** Healthcare Insurance Claims-EHR Linked Data
*   **Tier 4:** Specialty EHR Data (e.g., oncology, pediatrics, geriatrics, inpatient settings of care), Registry or Registry Network Data (product or disease-based registries), and Health Information Exchange (HIE) Data
*   **Tier 5:** Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Data
*   **Tier 6:** Data Platform – This platform is setup and managed by the Contractor
*   **Tier 7:** Scientific Support Services – These services are managed by Contractor

Data Partners (Tiers 1-5) and the Data Platform (Tier 6) are the two components of the Data Hub.

In a multi-tier IDIQ:

*   An individual vendor does not have to meet requirements for all IDIQ tiers but could be awarded more than one tier in the IDIQ.
*   Within a particular IDIQ tier, multiple vendors compete for and may be awarded task orders.
*   It will be a requirement for all IDIQ awardees to coordinate with other awardees for interconnected work.
*   Number of vendors awarded each IDIQ tier is contingent on program requirements and funding availability.

## Proposed Sentinel 3.0 Operational Framework

The Sentinel 3.0 will be led by the FDA SCC, which is staffed by the FDA. The Sentinel 3.0 will be supported by the PMO contractor, who will work in close collaboration with CDER, CBER and CDRH staff, as needed.

A key element of the Sentinel 3.0 operational framework is the establishment of a flexible and cost-effective technical solution via a Data Hub and Scientific Support Services contract. This contract will allow access to multiple types of healthcare data (Data Partners, Tiers 1-5), serve as a data repository, and provide informatics tools and capabilities (Data Platform, Tier 6), and provide scientific support services (Tier 7). FDA envisions that other government organizations (e.g., Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institutes of Health (NIH)) will leverage the Sentinel Data Hub (i.e., Data Platform (Tier 6) and the data provided by the participating Data Partners (Tiers 1-5)) to support the advancement of public health. The Scientific Support Services contractor(s) will provide scientific and technical support to the FDA program, including data analytics support by working in close collaboration with FDA SCC staff, the PMO contractor, and other FDA staff.

The Data Partners (Tiers 1-5) will provide all the data that will reside in the Data Platform (Tier 6). These data could include both individual-patient data as well as summarized and aggregated data. Data Partners (Tiers 1-5) will be awarded task order contracts to provide FDA the data according to the IDIQ Tier(s) awarded to the contractor. In addition, Data Partners (Tiers 1-5) will be capable of sub-contracting access to new, relevant data sources within the scope of the Tier(s) awarded to the contractor. Each Data Partner (Tiers 1-5) shall be able to manage the data use agreements with sub-contracted data partners and make those data available through the Data Platform (Tier 6).

The Data Platform (Tier 6), including a data repository component and informatics tools, will be on a FedRAMP cloud-based multi-tenant environment. The data provided by Data Partners (Tiers 1-5) will reside in the Data Platform (Tier 6) environment which provides the appropriate security controls and data accessibility rules. Though the multi-tenant environment will keep each Data Partners' data separate from other Data Partners' data, linkage of data partners data might be required for particular use cases as determined by FDA or other government agencies. Based on Data Platform user's role and authorized level of access (i.e., user “persona"), the Data Platform (Tier 6) contractor will grant access to the data relevant to individual FDA SCC staff, Scientific Support Services (Tier 7) staff, and other study team participant (i.e. FDA staff), as appropriate.

The Data Platform (Tier 6) is envisioned to integrate artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) capabilities directly into the data management and analytics workflow, automating tasks and enhancing insights. They aim to simplify data processes and empower users with AI-driven functionalities, from data preparation to advanced analytics and AI model deployment. In addition to the data repository, the Data Platform also includes informatics tools to perform data summarization, statistical analysis, and analytics necessary to conduct the study using the data in the data repository. It will have the flexibility to add more tools as necessary.

---

Data analysis and assessment will be conducted by the FDA Coordinating Center (FCC), Scientific Support Services contractors (Tier 7), and other FDA staff, with support from the PMO under a previously awarded contract. Additionally, the Scientific Support Services contractor (Tier 7) will lead efforts in data summarization, statistical analysis and analytics needed to carry out the study using the data repository and informatics tools.

The figure below shows how the different Sentinel 3.0 Data Hub and Scientific Support Services contract tiers are related to the FDA's operational framework. This figure identifies those components in the operational framework by a ★ that are to be fulfilled via this new Sentinel 3.0 contract.

**[Figure: Sentinel 3.0 Data Hub and Scientific Support Services Operational Framework]**

The IDIQ requires that all awardees coordinate and collaborate with other awardees on shared interconnected work. Sentinel 3.0 will rely on contractors cooperating across and within Tiers to provide FDA with the capabilities and data needed to address Sentinel 3.0 work.

Following is a high-level description of key functions of Sentinel 3.0 components to manage a typical request for Sentinel services (e.g., scientific consultations, requests for data to address regulatory questions). The FDA SCC will work with CDER, CBER, and CDRH staff to manage requests for Sentinel 3.0 services.

*   The FDA SCC will receive requests for Sentinel 3.0 services (e.g., scientific questions, requests for information or consultation) from FDA staff. These requests will be triaged and, as appropriate, routed to the PMO for initiation of a new project and tracking. The SCC, in collaboration with the Scientific Support Services contractor (Tier 7), will develop a strategy to address each service request, which may include consultation with Data Partners (Tiers 1-5), as tasked.
*   The PMO contractor provides support through scheduling meetings, managing study- or task-related documentation, and helping track deliverables and program performance metrics. The PMO manages a Collaboration Platform and Sentinel Initiative Website.
*   The FDA SCC will work with CDER, CBER, and CDRH staff, Scientific Support Services contractor (Tier 7), and Data Partners (Tiers 1-5) to identify the most appropriate data resources and scientific methods available to address the scientific question, develop a study protocol and methods, including a Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).
*   The Data Partners (Tiers 1-5) providing data to support a specific study are responsible for generating quality-checks and timely results in response to protocol implementation.
*   Data Platform (Tier 6) contractor provides a secure environment for Data Partners (Tiers 1-5), Scientific Support Services contractor (Tier 7), and FDA staff to exchange data readily available directly from the Data Partners (e.g., accessed via individual or enterprise-level licenses) or datasets generated as a result of specific queries to address safety surveillance questions.
*   The Scientific Support Services contractor (Tier 7) is responsible for conducting a second quality check of the summary data provided by the Data Partners (Tiers 1-5) and for integrating the study results if analyses are based on data from multiple Data Partners.
