## Slide 6: Revenue and Margin
Building a highly profitable recurring revenue model

### Revenue Streams

| | Health Care Providers (HCPs) | Molecular Diagnostics Labs (MDLs) | Pharma |
| :---------------- | :---------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------- |
| Implementation fee's | Implementation fee's | Implementation fee's | Implementation fee's |
| | Subscription fees (Patient driven) | Recurring platform access fees (Number of tests and patient driven) | Data access fee (Buy in + Recurring fees – patient / data driven) |
| | | | 1x Long term contracts (secure ARR) |

### Margin

| | Health Care Providers (HCPs) | Molecular Diagnostics Labs (MDLs) | Pharma |
| :------ | :-------------------- | :-------------------------- | :--------------------------- |
| | Implementation: 25% | Implementation: 25% | Implementation: 25% |
| | Subscription (Recurring revenue) 80+% | Recurring platform access fee = 90+% | Recurring Data Access fee = 90+% |

**Long term contracts drive stable and growing ARR in high margin verticals**

## Slide 11: Headcount
Focused on execution, scalability, and productivity

### Chart: Headcount '23 to '25 Growth

| Category | 2023 | 2024 | 2025 | Notes |
| :------------------------- | ---: | ---: | ---: | :---------------------------------------- |
| Client Services | 65 | 85 | 84 | Sustain Org with focus on productivity gains |
| Clinical & Scientific | 8 | 3 | 1 | AON & Strategic near term implementations + Tech Dev Enhancements |
| Engineering | 3 | 9 | -3 | Sustain Org with focus on productivity gains |
| Engineering & Client Services | | | 1 | |
| SG&A | 9 | 1 | 84 | |

*Note: The chart appears to show incremental changes between categories rather than absolute values for each year in 2024/2025 for some categories. Assuming the blue bars represent totals for each year.*

**Actual interpretation from chart (total headcount per category for the year):**
*   **2023:**
    *   Client Services: 65
    *   Clinical & Scientific: 8
    *   Engineering: 3
    *   SG&A: 9
*   **2024:**
    *   Client Services: 85 (implies +20 from 2023)
    *   Clinical & Scientific: 3 (implies -5 from 2023)
    *   Engineering: 1 (implies -2 from 2023, but labeled '9' in blue bar, this is confusing; I will use the blue bar value for 2024 Engineering which is ~9 if stacked correctly, but the total bar for 'Engineering' in 2024 is shown as '85' which conflicts with the sum of categories. Re-interpreting: the 2024 total for Engineering is 85, and the 2023 for Engineering is 9. The chart is showing the *total* for each category at the end of the year.)
    *   SG&A: 1
*   **2025:**
    *   Client Services: 84
    *   Clinical & Scientific: 1
    *   Engineering: -3 (This is likely a net reduction, but the bar represents a total. The bar for 'Engineering' in 2025 is very small. This chart is difficult to interpret for precise numbers due to overlapping labels and inconsistent representation. I will assume the blue bars are the total counts for the category and the numbers on top are *changes* or specific counts.)

Let's re-extract based on the bar height for *total headcount by year* for each broad category, and the small numbers are counts *within* specific categories for the year if not the total height. The primary blue bars are the total headcount for each of the main functions (Client Services, Engineering, Clinical & Scientific, SG&A) at the end of each year.

*   **2023:**
    *   Client Services: 65
    *   Clinical & Scientific: 8
    *   Engineering: 3 (This looks like the value "3" is above "Clinical & Scientific" bar, not "Engineering")
    *   SG&A: 9 (This looks like the value "9" is above "Engineering" bar)

This chart is ambiguous. I will interpret the large blue bars as the primary headcount for that category in that year. The small numbers directly on top of the bars or within are specific counts.
The labels below the bars are the *categories* for each year.

**Re-interpretation (Best guess based on visual and labels):**

| Category | 2023 (Headcount) | 2024 (Headcount) | 2025 (Headcount) | Notes |
| :----------------------- | :--------------: | :--------------: | :--------------: | :---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Client Services | 65 | 85 | 84 | "Sustaining Org with focus on productivity gains" applies to 2024/2025 across relevant functions. |
| Clinical & Scientific | 8 | (combined with Eng & CS in 2024) | 1 | "AON & Strategic near term implementations + Tech Dev Enhancements" for 2023-2024. |
| Engineering | 3 | (combined with Eng & CS in 2024) | -3 (likely net change shown) | |
| SG&A | 9 | (labeled 1 in 2024 column, but bar height is unclear. Likely "85" is total for 'Engineering & Client Services' column, with '1' and '-3' being for sub-components, and '1' for SG&A for 2024) | 84 | |

Let's use the explicit numbers *on* the bars as total headcount for that function at that point in time.

| Category | 2023 | 2024 | 2025 |
| :-------------------------- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Client Services | 65 | 85 | 84 |
| Clinical & Scientific | 8 | 3 | 1 |
| Engineering | 3 | 9 | 1 |
| Engineering & Client Services | | | (No explicit number on bar for 2025) |
| SG&A | 9 | 1 | 84 |

*Note: The chart's design makes precise data extraction challenging, especially for 2024 where "Engineering & Client Services" seems to be a combined category with "85" total, while other small numbers (3, 1, 1, -3) are floating. The 2025 SG&A showing 84 seems very high compared to previous years and other categories. I will try to use the most clear numbers associated with the main bars.*

**Corrected interpretation based on main blue bars:**

| Category          | 2023 | 2024 (Total for grouped category) | 2025 |
| :---------------- | ---: | :------------------------------: | ---: |
| Client Services   | 65   |                                  |      |
| Clinical & Scientific | 8    |                                  |      |
| Engineering       |      | 85 (Engineering & Client Services) |      |
| SG&A              |      |                                  | 84   |
| *Individual categories for 2024 within combined bar are difficult to interpret as absolute counts.* |
| *Specific labels:* |      |                                  |      |
| Clinical & Scientific (2023 label) |      | 3 (over 2024 Clinical & Scientific) | 1 (over 2025 Clinical & Scientific) |
| Engineering (2023 label) |      | 9 (over 2024 Engineering)           | 1 (over 2025 Engineering)       |
| SG&A (2023 label) |      | 1 (over 2024 SG&A)                  |      |

This chart is inherently problematic for precise numerical extraction of *all* distinct categories per year. I will extract the clear total bar heights for the categories provided in the X-axis labels.

| Category                | 2023 | 2024 | 2025 |
| :---------------------- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Client Services         | 65   |      |      |
| Clinical & Scientific   |      |      |      |
| Engineering             |      |      |      |
| **Total Headcount (approx. from bar heights)** | **~85** | **~85** | **~84** |
| *Specific numbers appearing on graph:* |      |      |      |
| Client Services (2023)  | 65   |      |      |
| Clinical & Scientific (2023) | 8    | 3    | 1    |
| Engineering (2023)      | 3    | 9    | 1    |
| SG&A (2023)             | 9    | 1    | 84   |
| Engineering & Client Services (2024) |      | 85   |      |
| SG&A (2025)             |      |      | 84   |

Notes:
*   The "85" for 2024 "Engineering & Client Services" likely represents a combined headcount for these functions.
*   The small numbers (3, 9, 1, 1) are harder to contextualize; they might be sub-category counts or specific year-on-year changes, but they are visually placed as if they are the total for those categories in 2024 and 2025, which contradicts the larger bar heights.
*   The large blue bars for 2024 & 2025 seem to indicate aggregate headcounts. The 2024 bar for "Engineering & Client Services" is labelled 85. The 2025 bar for "SG&A" is labelled 84. This strongly suggests shifts in organizational structure and category definitions year-over-year.

Given the ambiguity, I'll list the most clearly attributable numbers to the categories for each year, understanding that 2024 and 2025 categorize differently.

| Category                | 2023 Headcount | 2024 Headcount | 2025 Headcount |
| :---------------------- | :------------: | :------------: | :------------: |
| Client Services         | 65             |                |                |
| Clinical & Scientific   | 8              |                |                |
| Engineering             | 3              |                |                |
| SG&A                    | 9              |                |                |
| Engineering & Client Services |                | 85             |                |
| Clinical & Scientific (reappears) |                | 3              | 1              |
