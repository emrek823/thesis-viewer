## Summary
A Tegus Client speaks with a Rare Disease Medical Affairs, Outcomes & Analytics expert at Pfizer, Inc to understand the workflow and tools used by medical affairs professionals in the healthcare industry. The expert explains that medical affairs professionals engage with providers and health systems to provide education, guidance, and support, and use tools like Veeva and PubMed to identify key opinion leaders (KOLs). The Tegus Client asks about pain points and gaps in existing solutions, and the expert suggests that a software platform that can provide insights at a lower level of granularity would be valuable. The expert also emphasizes the importance of integrating data and insights to make it easier for users to access and digest information, and notes the need for contact information for KOLs and their involvement in presentations and conferences.

**Q: Can you speak to the key workflows around stakeholder engagement, for example identifying, engaging and managing key opinion leader (KOL) relationships?**

**A:** Yes I can speak to workflows and clinician engagements as I am involved directly involved in both across large territories.

**Q: Are you familiar with platforms such as H1, Komodo Health, Veeva, Iqvia, Definitive Health?**

**A:** I'm familiar with pretty much all: iqvia, definitiv and veeva and familiarizing with komodo right now. I can discuss the tools and pros/cons, as I have experience with using them.

**Tegus Client**
Hello. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. So I'm looking into software companies across a number of different verticals. I've been spending a bunch of time in health care and specifically within health care, understanding some of the tooling that exists.

Well, I guess, two things. One, kind of understanding broadly the workflow that exists in medical affairs and just learning about that part of the space, which is an interesting one that kind of, as I can tell, sits between the research and scientific side and the go-to-market side, but then also understanding specifically some of the tools and platforms that exist and enable medical affairs professionals to do their job and do it effectively, whether it's obviously, like a Veeva on the CRM side or an H1 or Komodo or Definitive Health on the data side.

So that's kind of the goal of the conversation. But more of the focus for this conversation is understanding, are there opportunities on the kind of more start-up side for companies to fill in and address pain points that may exist in the space that aren't yet well served or maybe weaknesses that exist within some of the incumbent platform. So that's the context for the conversation. I think maybe if you wouldn't mind, I'd love to hear a little bit about your background and kind of your role and focus areas just so I can, I guess, direct the questions or tailor the questions accordingly.

**Rare Disease Medical Affairs, Outcomes & Analytics at Pfizer, Inc**
Yes, sure. Yes. So basically, I am in medical affairs, exactly what you're describing as some of the things that are doing today, meaning engaging with providers with health systems and sitting sort of in between that clinical, scientific space and then also providing a lot of education, guidance, leveraging some of these tools to better understand like how certain aspects of like, I guess, the customer, whether it's a health system or a specific provider group or a specific individual provider.

Because I think what that does is it helps us drive better conversations, initiatives, projects, things like that, understand like where we need to focus on and what's important from their standpoint, even potentially ahead of some of our engagements, so to speak, right? So I think that's one of the things that these tools can be leveraged for.

But yes, that's basically my role. It's a lot of understanding of like the scientific side on a clinician by background, so I understand that side of the spectrum, the clinical side and then have health system operations background so I understand how providers work within the health system or within their area of specialty. And then just provide them with guidance, provide them with education, provide them with support depending on the therapeutic area that we're working on or disease state that we're focused on.

**Tegus Client**
Yes, that's super helpful. And maybe can you kind of walk through the key workflows that exist within the medical affairs' profession or department within your company?

**Rare Disease Medical Affairs, Outcomes & Analytics at Pfizer, Inc**
I think it depends probably on whoever you speak to. There's a variety, right, depending on certain roles, depending on certain responsibilities and also depending on certain, I guess, areas of focus and strategic initiatives and things like that. From a like a general standpoint, I think the workflow is basically you have an area that you're more or less focused on, whether it's endocrine cardiovascular, Gl, whatever it is.

And then you need to understand sort of like at a high level, what is happening in that particular space or some of these key, they call them KOLs, key opinion leaders, that are driving a lot of the scientific work, sometimes driving some of the sort of like social media initiatives or whatever else they're driving within their area of specialty, conferences and participating in all kinds of events and forums and things like that.

So having a good understanding of the landscape within your area of specialty, I think, is very important from like growth perspective. Understanding a level of like what your therapeutics are in that space. Obviously, I think these positions are within pharma companies. So understanding not only your therapeutics as it relates to your company but also other ones, competitors and things like that.

And I think, part of the workflow is also having significant interactions with a lot of the providers and health systems, understanding what they're doing, how they're doing it. Is there opportunities to improve some of the work that they're doing, whether it's diagnosing certain diseases better or treating certain diseases better or sort of like a population health, having a population health perspective, like what is that population of patients that are under specific therapeutics, what does that look like, right?

And sort of like whether it's for your area or nationally or whatever. I think you also have a medical affairs like certain roles that are based on certain geographies, then there's other roles that are based more nationally. If you're assigned to a geographical area, then you need to understand what that area looks like from your standpoint. And then how does that compare geographically across the country in terms of popHealth and things like that. So there's a lot of different, I guess, areas in medical affairs. I don't know if there's like one particular workflow, but there's certainly a variety of them and there's nuances to them as well.

**Tegus Client**
Yes, that's helpful overview. Maybe can you kind of walk me through like as a medical pairs professional, new drug is being released by your company, you got to go out and identify a bunch of KOLs to kind of talk to you about that drug. Walk me kind of start to finish through that process and maybe what some of the key tools are that you would use along the way.

**Rare Disease Medical Affairs, Outcomes & Analytics at Pfizer, Inc**
Yes. So I think that's definitely a big part of the work, right? Just understanding who are these KOLs that are working in your therapeutic area. So sometimes we do leverage things like Veeva, right? Because you could go in and you sort of like you could sort out based on geography, based on specialty or whatever other things that you're interested in and sort of hone in on, who are these providers and where do they work? And what are they affiliated with?

I think that particular tool is useful, like given you a good understanding of like who these folks are, right, professionally, what their involvement is in certain conferences, forums or online or whatever within their health system. What their position is, right, within a health system, which is important, right?

Like you want to know who you're talking to, is this person have like a high-level administrative role in addition to the clinical role that they practice in because, obviously, if that's the case, then that's the person that could drive decision-making across a hospital or health system, right? So that kind of insight is important to have before going and took a meeting with them.

So I think you could do things like you don't have to necessarily use certain tools. You could even go online and do Google searches, for example, you could look up somebody or go into a health system and use their website and try to find who some of these providers are.

The problem is, I think what happens a lot with trying to identify certain KOLs is you don't have a point of entry where you could get in touch with that person directly. You don't know what the best way to get in touch with them is. And so tools that are able to provide you with some sort of like entry point or like whether it's an e-mail or something like that, that you can kind of reach out to start a conversation, that's something that's useful just to get initiatives going.

Sometimes there's people that already have, within your company, established relationships so you could leverage them and you don't need to go find who these people are. However, I think the first thing you have to do is to get a good list of providers and then sort of filters through who are the most important ones.

**Tegus Client**
How do you determine who are the most important ones?

**Rare Disease Medical Affairs, Outcomes & Analytics at Pfizer, Inc**
So one of the ways that you could do that is you could, for example, go into PubMed and see like how many publications they've had in a particular area of expertise. So if you're looking at a disease or therapeutic, like are they involved in scientific research, right?

PubMed is a very useful site to foreseeing publications and what kind of research they're involved in. And if they are involved in like how important is it? And obviously, you leverage your background as a medical affairs' professional to understand the meaning of some of these publications, right?

And then understanding what like how useful that is in your space, right? Like is this person doing significant research? Or are they just starting out? Or are they presenting things in certain committees or conferences or whatever, associations within their specialty, right? Because there's obviously certain conferences that are more important than others.

And for example, I don't know, say, cardiology, there's a conference that all the top cardiologists will go to. And is that person has that at all been presenting there? Or are they participating or are they like a panel speaker or whatever and that sort of you can get an idea of like how important they are in their area or in your area.

So I think you have to aggregate a few things together to get to that point where you know that this person is important in the community of clinicians or therapeutic area. It's not just one thing that tells you like, "Oh, yes, this guy or this doctor is a KOL," right? It's a combination of things.

**Tegus Client**
Yes. And so it sounds like there's a bunch of different inputs into that process, makes a ton of sense. So then walk me through the workflow of actually aggregating the information that would inform like the short list of docs you want to hear, actually came up that you want to get in touch with?

**Rare Disease Medical Affairs, Outcomes & Analytics at Pfizer, Inc**
Yes. So I think one of the things definitely would be publications, right, research. So that's one area. Another area is, are they affiliated with a large hospital system, preferably a teaching hospital system, right? Are they affiliated with an important hospital system, right? Like, for example, somebody practicing at the Cleveland Clinic or being affiliated or being a chair of a particular department at a high-level institution could be considered more of a opinion leader than somebody at a lower level of institution.

So understanding where they're practicing, how many years they've been in practice? Again, do they have administrative roles in their institution? What are they? Are they part of any sort of association or certain associations within their discipline, right? So say that they are, I don't know, a nuclear medicine physician. Are they part of like a nuclear medicine association across this country? And if they are, are they just a member? Do they have seniority and there they could be somebody that's the Vice President of the association, right, or somebody that's just a regular member? So their memberships and certain associations is also important.

Online presence is another one, right? Like do they have a presence online? Are they being supported by their peers and some of the things that they're putting out, what are they saying? So like what that looks like, what that landscape looks like. That's another area to look into.

**Tegus Client**
Is there one centralized place where you can get that information? Like, for example, how do you, within your organization go about doing your job to aggregate those things? Is it a bunch of different tools? Is it a mix of like looking within your Veeva to understand prior interactions with the doctor and then cross referencing that against PubMed? I'm just curious, walk me through maybe how you aggregate that information.

**Rare Disease Medical Affairs, Outcomes & Analytics at Pfizer, Inc**
I don't think there is one stop shop like process or application. I think it's just kind of cherry picking out of like certain areas, right? So we could have internal tools of like certain interactions or whatever. Obviously, each company has their own things that they measure or whatever or like level of like interactions that they've had, I guess, with certain physicians and relationships that they have with certain opinion leaders in the industry that they're in or therapeutic area that they're in. So that's one facet of it, whatever that looks like, I think, differs from place to place.

I think in terms of like tools, right, Veeva is definitely useful for that for understanding a little bit of like what sort of like their online presence is, whether it's publication, social media, things like that, like what that looks like. So I think that's useful. I think they're using basically whatever public information is available and just aggregating anything that's public that they could pull together, at least that was my understanding of the way they operate. I don't remember if they pull from PubMed, that's something that I have to look into. But you could always go to PubMed and do your own searches and put in your alerts and things like that. So that's another area where you could get insights from.

So I think a combination of those. Also, I think getting some sort of like publicly available data of like what they're diagnosing, what they're seeing, claims, things like that, like I think, Definitive pull some of that. So you could always go into something like Definitive and look at like what a particular institution is doing in terms of like claims, in terms of like diagnosing, in terms of financials and things like that and just see where they're at.

And sort of use that a little bit to understand like how involved they are in a particular therapeutic and a particular diagnostic area from a health system perspective. So I think those things together kind of give you a good idea. And then obviously, I think people also use just whatever else they can find online. I mean, that's always like something that it's just like if there's something that you're looking for or maybe one of these tools doesn't have it, you're just going to go looking for it yourself.

LinkedIn, for example, like it's another thing that people used to see like what people are posting, Twitter is another thing, so these social media platforms just to gather information and see sort of like who these providers are and like what their work looks like online.

**Tegus Client**
Yes, makes sense. Would you say it's like a major pain point to have to rely on, is very similar to your previous information or not really, it kind of works well? I guess one of the things I'm trying to understand and kind of the goal of these questions is, as I understand kind of the existing solutions out there, like is there a room for innovation? Is there a pain that exists within those solutions that might lead you to say, hey, you might be interested in trying a new platform that can try to aggregate some of that data for you in one place.

**Rare Disease Medical Affairs, Outcomes & Analytics at Pfizer, Inc**
Yes. So I definitely think there is room in this space. I think that there needs to be more clarity in like the data side of things, not necessarily like some understanding like who a provider is because that you could figure out, right, like you could see, like you could find things online about them and sort of understand like what their level of involvement is who they are, what their tenure is, what their presence is and things like that, I think that you could find.

I think one of the things that is still just kind of my experience, one of the things that's still not well baked enough is just the level of granularity in terms of like what certain disease states and therapeutic areas look like from the hospital side and the provider side of things. And Definitive kind of tries to do that, I think, by aggregating some data together and they give you some claims data information.

However, I don't know if it's granular enough in terms of like you getting a good understanding of like, for example, if this particular disease is well documented or well identified within a health system, right? I don't know if like claims data is enough to tell you that, right? And sometimes people coming from a health system side and clinical practice side, understand the nuances of that and what that means.

And I think sometimes these companies, they think like, oh, by just giving you like very high-level overview of like what the landscape looks like for a particular therapeutic area or disease state is enough, and sometimes it's not like you'd want to know like are patients being diagnosed the way they should be diagnosed for this particular diagnosis. Are they being treated the way they should be treated?

Are they being followed up like the way they should be followed up? Is there some sort of standard and what does that look like? And I think that's still a black hole from the medical affairs' standpoint. I think that's something that may be on the medical side in terms of like the health system internally, maybe they have better access to data. And obviously, they could understand what that looks like better on their end. But for us, it's still a struggle to understand that picture.

And because I think that gives us a good understanding of like what we should focus on and sort of like have more meaningful initiatives and conversations and education around. And we sometimes have to rely on what people are telling us, and we can't get enough clarity or good enough data to really form our own picture, right? So sometimes somebody will tell us like, oh, yes, we are diagnosing certain diseases. But then when you're looking on some data, you're like, okay, that doesn't align well with what piece people are saying, right? So there is a discrepancy.

And then when you go into one of these tools to try to like figure out a way to get some sort of like data to match what somebody is saying, there's maybe not enough capabilities within it, and it's lacking whether it's because they don't have enough access or maybe they just don't know how to manipulate it good enough. I don't know. I think that's an area of opportunity.

**Tegus Client**
Can you talk a little bit more about that? I just want to make sure I understand sort of what the gap is?

**Rare Disease Medical Affairs, Outcomes & Analytics at Pfizer, Inc**
The gap is just like, for example, using Definitive as an example, the gap is sometimes their level of insights is not deep enough for us to get a good understanding of like what certain places are doing in terms of like diagnostic work of diagnosing, treating and things like that. Like say you're working in a space for a particular disease and they may have access to certain data, but then their data that they have access to is just not good enough for you to give good insights on what's happening in that disease state.

And again, I don't know if it's just because of their capabilities or maybe it's just because there's not enough data available. But a lot of times, we're not getting what we're looking for in terms of like the level of insights that we need sometimes.

**Tegus Client**
That makes sense. What are the sort of the key like data points for maybe let me ask a question in a separate way. If I were to come to you and say, hey, I'm trying to build software for medical care professionals. I know there's a bunch of big platforms like Veeva infinitive but what are some of the weaknesses of those platforms? And if you were to sort of advise me with a whiteboard and say, hey, here's what you could build to really create value for me as a medical affairs professional, here's something I'd be willing to pay for as a software platform, what would that be?

**Rare Disease Medical Affairs, Outcomes & Analytics at Pfizer, Inc**
Yes, I think that's a great question to ask. I think that's what I would say. I would say, get to the lowest level of granularity that you can get to in terms of like data insights from a practicing perspective, from a clinical perspective and show in a clear, concise way the things that you're trying to show, like whether it's a disease prevalence or disease incidents, be able to mine it and filter it or slice it to the lowest level that you can, right?

Like I was using the tool the other day, and I don't remember what the name of it was. But I was trying to find a particular disease across just to get insights on like a particular geography. And it was giving me insights at a country level. I don't need insights at a country level. I need insights at a town level or at a borough level and a city or something like that, right?

Like you need to get really granular because a lot of times, a lot of medical affairs professionals are working with specific territories with specific hospitals that are in a particular town, right? So they need to know what that looks like, that population looks like, right? How many patients were seen, how many patients were diagnosed with a certain condition, like what does that look like over the past year or five years, who are the practitioners that are making these diagnoses, right?

Sometimes you don't have access to that. Like I don't know out of a hospital, if I take 40 clinicians, I don't know who's making most of these diagnoses, is it just one guy? Is it 5 guys? Is it 10 guys? Having that access, that kind of information is very useful because then you could focus your sort of work, all right? This is the doctor that's making more site diagnosis? Or this is the group that's making these diagnoses or whatever, right? Or is that prescribing a certain medication?

So that's what I'm trying to say, like a lot of these platforms are like too high level, like when you go to high level, I don't get enough like granularity for me to have use of it. So I just give up on using it. I'm just kind of like doing my own research sometimes. And that's hard too because you don't know what you're getting, if it's good or not.

**Tegus Client**
Yes, yes. Can you talk a little bit about the tools that you are using and maybe how you use them? Like you mentioned, as an example, Veeva.

**Rare Disease Medical Affairs, Outcomes & Analytics at Pfizer, Inc**
Yes. So Veeva I use for insight gathering on like certain clinicians, right? Like you could do a lot of like, basically, you could look up somebody by name and you could see like what the what their presence is, what they're affiliated with, as they're part of certain organizations or whatever.

I think at least that's some of the things that I've known about it and kind of used it for us it's sort of like Google up in a sense, like you could just kind of search somebody up and just find out information. I guess that's publicly available about them that is aggregated. So you don't have to kind of go to different websites and different platforms and stuff like that.

So I think that's useful in a way because it's like you can go to one place and see things about somebody, right? So you could see all their postings on Twitter or LinkedIn or whatever else they get it from. It's a little bit invasive like just personal and it's in a weird way because you're like, all right, this is like very like it just kind of gives you a weird vibe of like somebody like just gets everything online about you and just put it into something and you could find it, but that's what they do.

So in that sense, I think one of the main uses of that platform is just understanding who one person is and what their background is like and what their presence is online in terms of like other congresses and organizations and things like that. Definitive, I think you're more like looking at financial information, claims data for like a particular hospital or health system. So you're sort of using it to get insights on the business side of things and maybe some clinical kind of like billing, diagnostics side.

So Definitive, from that perspective, I just, again, I feel like they're limited in terms of like the depth and just the granularity of like the data. And then I think they're also limited in terms of like data presentation. I don't find their output, whatever they're using for their dashboards or reports or whatever to be very user-friendly, which I hate like not having user-friendly data visualizations because it's like I have to figure out what I'm looking at.

And I don't like that because I feel like it makes my life harder and like I have to do extra work. And so I've struggled with that part of it. And I think a lot of people that are not even as data savvy and visualization savvy as me are probably not even like using it for that reason.

So I think that's another piece where there's area of improvement, right? Like how do you present data in a meaningful way? And you're not just splitting that out and you're just putting numbers on the page and just kind of like just giving some output based on things that you're gathering, right, on your software, but just make it meaningful, like what does this mean? Like was this a trend? Or like what are these trends? Or what like just a combination of things like the way they present data is very sloppy. It's very hard to navigate.

That's another thing. It's like a lot of times I'm just getting lost in terms of like navigation, have to contact somebody to show me like what I'm supposed to be doing to get to where I need to get to. So what ends up happening is, like I have to talk to somebody from their company to say, hey, I'm looking for this. I'm looking for that, but I don't know how to look for it in your software, like it's not very user-friendly.

Like your filters, looks like their filtering is like a mess. It's hard to like filter sort of things and figure out like how to put that into a report. Like I wish they could just have it where it's easier for me to put it together like a more simpler way. Like there are some EHR platforms that have like self-reporting tools where you can go in and you could build your own report in five minutes, right, based on data that you're getting from the EHR.

Now that's user-friendly functionality, right, where somebody could slice the data easier, very easily in like four or five steps. Like if it's taken me half an hour to figure out a way to pull some data, it's way too complicated. Like I'm not going to sit there. And I don't even know what I'm getting at is useful for what I'm looking for. I think their idea is good, like they're looking to provide insights However, their execution is not very good.

**Tegus Client**
And explain once more the difference between the data that you can get in Veeva versus the data that you would get in like a Definitive?

**Rare Disease Medical Affairs, Outcomes & Analytics at Pfizer, Inc**
Yes. So in Veeva, are you getting data that's like centered around an individual's sort of like presence, like who they are, what they're doing, like where they're located, like what they're associated with like things like that, right? Like who they are as a person, clinician, whatever, right? So insights about sort of like, you could sort of kind of figure out are they a KOL type of person? Or are they a newcomer in the space or like something like that, right? And what their online presence looks like, things like that.

And with Definitive, it's like more like you're getting insights on the health system or a particular specialty group or hospital as far as like what their performance looks like, what their metrics are, what their claims data is like and sort of like more like financial, clinical information. You're not getting like information for a particular doctor, like who this person is in your institution and what their involvement is with the therapeutic or disease, right?

**Tegus Client**
Got it. So it's more of a provider or system level as opposed to at the individual level, which is what Veeva is.

**Rare Disease Medical Affairs, Outcomes & Analytics at Pfizer, Inc**
Right. And I'm thinking out loud, I don't know, maybe like in an ideal world, it would be like a combination of those two would be even better because then you have like a level of insight on not only what your health system looks like or specialty group or whatever.

But then without having to go to another platform, see who these individuals are and maybe have some sort of relationships within that platform of like how they're interacting in that hospital health system or specialty therapeutic area and mixing with like their online presence, presence in conferences and all that. And so that will be like a one-stop shop where you could get both things and add on some sort of like insights of like metrics or indicators or whatever for the individual and for the health system. So just like everything in one, if that's possible.

**Tegus Client**
Are there any other tools you use, like, for example, I've heard of platforms like H1 or Komodo Health? I'm curious if you've come across those or evaluated them at any point?

**Rare Disease Medical Affairs, Outcomes & Analytics at Pfizer, Inc**
I've heard of Komodo Health. I don't know enough about it. Another one that's out there, I think, Clarivate. I don't know if you've heard of it.

**Tegus Client**
Yes, I have heard of it, but I don't really know anything about it. Curious, do you have any perspective?

**Rare Disease Medical Affairs, Outcomes & Analytics at Pfizer, Inc**
Yes, I think that's the one that I was telling you about that it's like very high level in terms of like what they present, in terms of like, it's just too broad. Like I guess when you may be depending if you're in a position where you're overseeing things from a very high level and you just kind of need to know what things look like across a country or area or whatever maybe that's good enough.

However, I don't see value in it being used like at a staff level where people are kind of like using this day in and day out to get insights into kind of like drive conversations and engagements. It's just like I would use it once, I would look at it, I would just maybe get some maybe some information if I could find something and then probably not go back to it again.

It would be like one of those things that you're just kind of like, oh, it's nice, but not really valuable for like day-to-day kind of work. Because I think what most people are looking for is things that they're going to be able to reference day in and day out or weekly or something or biweekly or whatever, right, because a lot of people are having engagements with providers all the time, right?

So it's like you need to be aware of like, oh, this person published something else or this hospital was involved in a clinical trial or whatever, right? So it's like how do you get that information without you having to go look for it, right? Like with PubMed, you could set up like an alert that tells you like based on certain criteria or if you choose a disease, they'll send you like an e-mail list of like all the publications that came out about that disease for the past week or two.

And then if you go through it, you could figure out, okay, this is a meaningful study, who did this, let me see, like where it came out of or whatever. But having something that gives me that information where I don't have to like look for it and set up something separately would be useful.

Because then it's like a one-stop shop like, for example, if I'm looking for a provider, a specific provider that I'm in contact with, what are some of the things that I should know about this person as I'm like talking to them or have a relationship with them? Well if they're presenting at a conference next week, I should know about it, how do you get that information to me without me having to go look for it or alert me somehow of like what's going on with them or something.

Things like that, like when you're sort of like making people's lives a little bit easier because a lot of times what I think people and medical affairs are doing it is they're just doing a lot of research on their own, right? They're trying to find information, and it's like you're going at multiple places to look for things where you should be sort of like with all the data and insights and the capabilities that we have, we should be able to get it a little bit easier, more digestible format, and not multiple platforms. So any way that you could integrate things together and make it like easy to digest and present it in a way that's useful for the user. I think that's a win.

Yes. That totally makes sense. Great. Well, this has been really helpful. I appreciate you taking the time.

**Rare Disease Medical Affairs, Outcomes & Analytics at Pfizer, Inc**
No, yes, definitely. I think, again, like there's opportunity in this space, a lot of opportunity. I think, again, keep in mind, data granularity is very important. If you could get something at the most granular level, I think that's always useful for people because it gives them a good understanding of like what's happening, right, and you don't have to rely necessarily on certain people telling you something and then you finding out something else.

In a particular disease data, especially, I think it's huge because like it makes conversations better because you can come in sort of like understanding like, okay, this is what your area looks like. This is what your geography looks like. And what are you doing about it or like how are you managing your patients or whatever. And then you could supplement what you're using from the tool, from what you're getting from conversation with the providers, right, and kind of put a full picture together.

And again, like that's not available in these platforms and then what ends up happening is people end up building their own platforms and what they're looking for and using that internally or trying to find that information somewhere else. And also, I think one of the things that's very simple, that's not common, it's just figuring out how to get in touch with certain people in ways that are meaningful.

**Tegus Client**
Does Definitive not offer that? I thought Definitive offers kind of contact data. Is that not the case?

**Rare Disease Medical Affairs, Outcomes & Analytics at Pfizer, Inc**
I don't think so. Not as far as I know, because that's something that I think some people are struggling with. So I don't know like why that's the thing, but it is the thing. Yes. I think that's important. And just kind of like understanding, I think, in a way, understanding like where and how these KOLs are involved in certain things and like in terms of like where they're at, where they're going to be. Like what they're part of like when they're going to be at certain or do certain presentations, I don't think these softwares are able to provide that data.

Like for example, like somebody is presenting next week in, I don't know, Chicago or something, right, at a conference around my disease that I'm following like how do I find that out? Maybe I end up finding it out by somebody telling me about it, word-of-mouth or maybe just some random Googling or whatever.

But what if somebody send me that information just because I had a relationship with that provider, right, or I'm like working with them. And I didn't know about it, they didn't tell me about it, but somehow there is some tools that could send me that information that I was that would be aware, right?

That's another very important thing that we don't have access to, and that we always go looking for things like that because sometimes you want to participate in that, talk to you, want to hear what they have to say, maybe it's an opportunity to meet them face-to-face or whatever, just have an interaction. And you're always looking for things like that, and there is no way for like I don't think there is a way for us to get that information at our fingertips. That would be something that's very useful.

Because a lot of times interactions happen in person, and then they build relationships like that, right? And they see you coming to see them and you're interested in what they have to say. And not just from like just the relationship side but also from the therapeutic side, like what they're presenting on, you want to be part of that.

And they like clinicians like or medical affairs people to be part of that because it shows interest, genuine interest in their work. And so a lot of times, we don't know where things are happening, how are they happening, what we need to do to be part of those things and like we don't have that information. That's a gap you wanted to talk about gap.

**Tegus Client**
Yes, makes sense. Thank you so much for taking your time again, and I appreciate it, and this has been really helpful. Have a good one.
