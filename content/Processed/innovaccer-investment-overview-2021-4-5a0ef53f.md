## Slide 11: key growth levers what will fuel growth
**Go To Market Motions**

*   **platform**
    *   Providers, Payers
    *   get the platform deployed at as many healthcare providers as possible
    *   **core business**
        *   we need to figure out easier ways to get the platform embedded in more customers (cheaper pricing)

*   **workflows**
    *   Providers, Payers, Employers, Life Sciences
    *   increase the number of workflows on the platform to increase value for users
    *   **platform effect**
        *   we need to figure out more and more subject matter expert partners (e.g PwC and BCG) to develop workflow solutions on the platform.

*   **collaborations**
    *   Providers, Payers, Employers, Life Sciences
    *   get siloed stakeholders to engage with each —other to create efficiencies in process and monetize the efficiency gains
    *   **network effect**
        *   we need to figure out quantification models for the efficiencies so that we can price things as a percentage of efficiency gain.
