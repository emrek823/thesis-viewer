## Slide 6: Barriers to care are high, and getting worse...

### Barriers to care are high, and getting worse...

**01 Long patient wait times**
* Patients wait an average of **31 days** to schedule a physician appointment
  in 15 of the largest U.S. metropolitan areas – up 19% from 2022 and 48%
  from 2004 (AMN).
* 3 in 4 Americans think it’s easier to visit the ER than to get a doctor's
  appointment (Zocdoc)
* In-person visits are further inconvenient due to office wait times – avg
  time for one PCP cycle is 30-60 mins including check-in, waiting & check
  out (15-18 mins for actual visit)

**02 Visits are costly**
* With insurance: $10-$50 copay or urgent/PCP care (advent health)
* Without insurance: $150-$300+ for PCP & urgent care (advent health)
* 36% of US adults reported delaying or postponing care due to cost (KFF)

**03 Growing physician shortage**
* Projections indicate a potential deficit of over **87,000 physicians by 2037**,
  particularly affecting rural areas.
* This shortage is driven by an aging physician population nearing
  retirement and increasing demand from an aging population (HRSA.gov).

## Slide 7: What if there was a better way to...

### What if there was a better way to...

**01 Enable fast access to HCPs**
A marketplace of telehealth providers for users to
pick from, offering real-time availability. Support
patients in message only visits + F2F

**02 Reduce cost of care to $25**
Optimize time in the encounter by enhancing patient
intake / symptom collection via multiturn interviews,
driven by AI agents. Offset CAC by leveraging de-id
data for research.

**03 Reduce workflow burden**
AI-first solution for physicians, real-time assistance
during the encounter, and document generation.
Optimized workflows enables PCPs to increase their
panel size and generate more revenue

## Slide 9: TAM, SAM, SOM

### TAM
1B outpatient physician office visits per year in the US (CDC)

### SAM
13%*1B = 130M Visits
* Limit to problems that can be tackled via telehealth calls, 13% of
  ambulatory visits were handled via telehealth (KFF)
130M/3 = 43.3M Patients
* Translate from visits to people, average of 3 visits per year per
  person

### SOM
* Conservative Capture: 1% of the market (500K patients/year)
* Avg. revenue per patient = $155/year (visits + data monetization)
* Target = 150,000 patients in 1.5 years
  * $23.2M
* Target = 500,000 patients in 3 years
  * $77.5M
