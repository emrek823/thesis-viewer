[### 40% BMET Retirement Means AI-Native Is the Only Path

Hospital equipment maintenance is a $22B market running on 1990s tools while 40% of the technician workforce retires. 7,300 openings/year vs 400 graduates/year (18:1 gap). 30 BMET programs closed in 5 years; 23 states have no training pathway ([[claude compass\_artifact\_wf-47eb8b48-df83-488d-a269-b71...

Biopharma operations tooling only serves the top 50 companies. The remaining 5,950 run trials on Excel, manage CDMOs through email, and guess at clinical supply ([[Jake \_\_ Virtue]]). Only 50 of 6,000 pharma companies do systematic clinical supply forecasting. The rest rely on 7-10 day consultant tur...

Clinical trial operations is the last Excel stronghold in pharma. 94% of trials delayed >1 month, each delay costing $600K-$8M/day ([[slope-seed-pitch-deck---q4-2019-05f0f0f4]]). The industry spends $80B annually on trials while 30-50% of operations still run on spreadsheets ([[Director at a Pharmac...

Healthcare payment infrastructure is built for insurance. As cash-pay, DPC, and self-funded models grow, the rails can't support them. The opportunity isn't float (basis points for providers)—it's admin savings: prompt pay penalties, MA stars impact, re-adjudication costs, call center burden ([[Matt...

Healthcare AI is stratified into four levels—and only Level 0-1 is investable today. Level 0 (administrative: scribes, scheduling) and Level 1 (assistive: coaches, navigators) are capturing $1B+ in revenue. But Level 2 (supervised autonomous: AI prescribing with physician oversight) and Level 3 (ful...

US biosimilar adoption is 20% vs EU's 80% because of perverse economics—hospitals lose $3,148 per patient by switching from Avastin to Mvasi ([[Claude-MSO transactions and biosimilar market evolution]]). This isn't ignorance; it's rational behavior. Hospitals get paid % of list price, so higher-pric...

Services businesses in healthcare (RCM, credentialing, billing, intake) are ripe for AI arbitrage: acquire manual service providers at 2-3x EBITDA, implement AI automation, achieve 10x profit growth while maintaining service pricing. The wedge is distribution—service providers already have relations...

Healthcare call centers are a $2B+ market with obvious AI automation opportunity—but the investment angle isn't the technology. It's distribution. Assort Health proved the math: 40%+ abandonment → 4-6%, 7-8 min calls → 2-2.5 min, 7 FTEs → 4 FTEs with better outcomes ([[Chief Executive Officer at Bar...

Foundation models in biology commoditize faster than in language—open-source parity in 12-18 months. Structure prediction is solved (AlphaFold). Binding prediction is commoditizing. \*\*The thesis has shifted: Chai-2's 86% developability validation proves computational moats are possible, but clinical...

Health systems run on cross-subsidization: elective procedures (22-25% margins) fund emergency care (-15% to -18% margins). One spinal fusion offsets three sepsis cases ([[An Analysis of DRG Profitability and Cross-Subsidization in Academic Medical Centers]]). AI that improves elective efficiency pr...

Healthcare AI moats are NOT in the model layer—foundation models commoditize in 12-18 months. Durable moats come from three interlocking layers: \*\*evaluators\*\* (domain-specific correctness definitions), \*\*canonical data models\*\* (ontologies encoding structural truth), and \*\*hybrid architecture\*\* (de...

The wet lab is becoming programmable, but there's a mismatch: the execution layer is commoditizing (Physical Intelligence open-sourced pi0, fine-tunable with 1-20 hours of data) while instruments remain stuck in the GUI era. Thermo Fisher, Tecan, Hamilton—all built for human operators with manual ca...

LLMs are hitting a ceiling in healthcare—they predict tokens, not patient trajectories. Standard Model research showed LLMs achieve only 30.3% completeness on real oncology treatment decisions ([[The Patient is Not a Document Moving from LLMs to a World Model for Oncology (Part 1)]]). The next wave ...

Specialty VBC follows a predictable evolution: navigation → platform → 2-sided risk. The companies that win control the highest-cost lever in their specialty. In oncology, that's drug spend (70% of total cost). In cardiology, it's procedural appropriateness. In mental health, it's treatment modality...

PE is consolidating healthcare AI/RCM into platform plays—and standalone vendors are getting squeezed. The signal is unmistakable: Matt Holt left New Mountain Capital to combine Datavant, Swoop, Machinify, SmarterDx, and Office Ally into "Thoreau"—a $30B health-tech venture ([[Holt exits New Mountai...

Pharma spends 40-85% of pharmacovigilance budgets on manual case processing—a $8-10B market growing 10-15% annually while manual capacity is exhausted. AI reduces processing costs 50-70% while enabling capabilities impossible before: real-time signal detection across FAERS' 2M annual reports, compet...

Payment integrity is shifting from post-pay recovery to pre-pay prevention—and the economics are brutal for laggards. Pre-pay market is $9B vs post-pay $2-3B ([[Sr Technical Product Manager at Optum \_ Cotiviti Holdings, Inc. \_ Tegus]]). The math: post-pay recovers $0.40 of every $1 after vendor fees...

Prior auth automation is a graveyard of VC-backed startups. The pattern: raise Series A/B, prioritize growth, let quality collapse, customers churn to in-house. Silna Health is the case study: 200 payers, 30 states, saves 50-100 hours/week—but 5% error rate (50/1000 auths wrong) is "unacceptable" ([...

DNA is "once and done"—you sequence it once and the medical utility is mostly cancer. Proteins change constantly—weekly, monthly, yearly—creating a recurring testing model at tens of dollars per sample ([[Alex \_\_ Emre]]). Genomics built Illumina. Proteomics builds recurring revenue diagnostics busin...

Radiology is the last major healthcare IT market stuck on fragmented, on-prem software—and regulatory shifts just unlocked cloud unification. $110B US radiology market, 600M annual exams, >80% of all healthcare data by volume ([[sirona-97c97c5a]]).

Big 3 PBMs (CVS Caremark, Express Scripts, OptumRx) control ~80% of market and extract ~$50B annually through opacity: spread pricing, rebate retention, affiliated pharmacy steering. That's ending. CMS enforcement imminent—Executive Order 14221 (Feb 2025) directs HHS to enforce prescription drug MRF...
