# Trifetch Pre-Call Brief

## Quick Context
Trifetch is an AI company founded by Varuni Sarwal. Limited information available on specific product/market focus, though CRM notes reference "AI infrastructure" as the investment angle. The company has paying customers and attended NeurIPS (December 2025) and is attending JPM Healthcare Conference this week, which suggests either healthcare AI focus or cross-industry positioning.

## Similar Deals
First deal in this space for us based on available records. The CRM note asking "what is the play in AI infrastructure" suggests this may be infrastructure/tooling rather than application layer. No comparable deals in vault to benchmark against.

This is interesting because infrastructure plays can have very different economics than vertical applications. If Trifetch is building picks-and-shovels for AI development, the customer base and competitive dynamics differ significantly from a vertical healthcare AI company. The JPM attendance is confusing if this is pure infrastructure. Worth clarifying the actual positioning early in the call.

## Thesis Fit
**Exploratory - doesn't map cleanly to current theses**

The CRM note "What is the play in AI infrastructure" suggests we're still trying to understand where this fits. Potential new thesis area if: (a) they're building differentiated AI tooling with defensible moats beyond commoditized infra, or (b) they're a vertical AI company using "infrastructure" loosely to describe their platform.

Key question for this call: Are they infrastructure (selling to AI developers) or application (selling to end customers like health systems)?

## Prior Context
This is technically our first real meeting, though we've been in email contact since November 2025:

- **Nov 3, 2025**: Initial outreach from Emre, mentioned Standard Model Bio, Integral, Protege, Segmed as relevant portfolio/network companies
- **Nov 25, 2025**: Varuni was traveling extensively, pushed to December
- **Dec 8, 2025**: Varuni asked if Emre is Boston-based, mentioned being there Dec 20+
- **Dec 10, 2025**: Varuni said "things are super busy with customers" and suggested waiting until SF trip
- **Jan 5, 2026**: Emre followed up for JPM week meeting
- **Multiple reschedules**: Original call was Dec 15, then Jan 12, then Jan 14, now Jan 15

The "busy with customers" comment in December is a good signal. The NeurIPS attendance suggests technical depth. The JPM attendance this week suggests healthcare relevance or at least healthcare customers.

Open from prior emails: Emre mentioned being "curious of some of your takeaways coming back from NeurIPS" in December. This could be a natural opening for the call.

## Discussion Questions

Varuni has been hard to pin down (multiple reschedules, traveling constantly, busy with customers) which reads as either genuine traction or avoidance. The JPM + NeurIPS combination is unusual. Questions should clarify what Trifetch actually does and whether the traction signals are real.

**1. Can you walk us through what Trifetch actually builds and who the customer is?**
*Context: CRM note asks "what is the play in AI infrastructure" - we don't have deck or clear product description. Need to establish basics before going deeper.*

**2. You mentioned being busy with customers back in December. Can you break down who those customers are, how you landed them, and what they're paying?**
*Context: Dec 10 email said "things are super busy with customers." Want to understand if this is real revenue or pilots, and what kind of customers (AI companies vs. enterprises).*

**3. What brought you to NeurIPS in December, and what brought you to JPM this week?**
*Context: NeurIPS = technical/ML research conference. JPM = healthcare investor/biopharma conference. The combination is unusual. Either they're selling to both AI developers and healthcare, or one of these is more about fundraising than customers.*

**4. When Emre mentioned Standard Model Bio, Integral, Protege, and Segmed in his first email, you said he's "connected with a lot of super relevant companies." What made those relevant to you?**
*Context: From Nov 3 email. These span foundation models for biopharma, data de-identification, and healthcare data. Understanding the connection point reveals positioning.*

**5. If you're building AI infrastructure, what layer of the stack are you at? Are you selling to AI developers or to end enterprises?**
*Context: CRM note frames this as "AI infrastructure" but infrastructure is a broad category. Matters for TAM, competition, and sales motion.*

**6. What does your technical stack look like today, and what's core to defensibility vs. what could be replicated with off-the-shelf tools?**
*Context: Infrastructure plays live or die on moats. If the core tech can be rebuilt with open source + commodity cloud, pricing pressure will be severe.*

**7. How long have you been working on this and what were you doing before Trifetch?**
*Context: No background on Varuni in our records. Technical founder vs. business founder matters for infrastructure company. NeurIPS attendance suggests technical background.*

**8. What's driving the fundraise timing? Are you raising now?**
*Context: November email said Varuni "scheduled a time for us to chat" mid-December after Emre's outreach. The call has been pushed multiple times. Want to understand if this is active fundraise or relationship-building.*

**9. If you are raising, what are you trying to prove with this round, and what's the target size?**
*Context: No deck shared, no round details in any materials. Need to understand stage and milestones.*

**10. What does your current team look like, and who would you hire first with new capital?**
*Context: No team information available. For infrastructure companies, technical hiring velocity often correlates with product velocity.*

**11. Who do you see as your main competition, and what's your honest assessment of where they're ahead vs. behind?**
*Context: AI infrastructure is crowded. Understanding competitive awareness and positioning matters.*

**12. You've rescheduled this call a few times around customer work and travel. What's been consuming most of your time the last two months?**
*Context: Multiple reschedules since November. Could be good (customer demand) or concerning (operational chaos). Worth understanding directly.*

## What to Probe

**To get excited, we'd need to see:**
- Clear product with paying customers (not just pilots)
- Defensible technical moat beyond commoditized infra
- Founder with relevant technical depth (NeurIPS attendance is promising)
- If healthcare-focused: specific wedge and path to scale
- If horizontal infrastructure: why they win against well-funded competitors

**Red flags to watch for:**
- Vague on actual product or customer
- "Infrastructure" that's really just a wrapper on OpenAI/Anthropic APIs
- JPM attendance driven by fundraising rather than customer traction
- Can't articulate specific differentiation
- Customer "traction" that's actually unpaid pilots or LOIs

The key question this call answers: Is this a real company with real traction, or a concept that hasn't found product-market fit yet? The "busy with customers" signal is positive, but we have zero supporting detail.
