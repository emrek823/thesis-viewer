### Eitri Strategy & Market Focus for 2026

- 2026 - the year of building for biotechs and CDMOs and ecosystem around their collaboration and knowledge sharing
- Primary focus on biotechs and CDMOs vs. Big Pharma
	- Validated thesis: industry moving toward decentralized specialized manufacturing
	- Smaller, leaner clinical teams (biotechs) + outsourced specialized contractors (CDMOs)
	- Collaboration/planning between these parties increasingly high friction and bottleneck
- Core problem for biotech manufacturing executives:
	- Must deliver quantity + quality on timeline or company fails
	- Batch failures from yield problems or quality issues
	- Review delays from document processing (150+ hours per batch)
	- Lack of control/visibility into third-party processes

### Near-Term Product: Batch Record Review

- Initial wedge product: PDF batch record processing
	- Make documents searchable, commentable, exportable
	- AI agent first-pass review identifying issues/deviations
	- Several clinical biotechs interested in pilots next couple months
- Process deviation detection (6-12 month horizon):
	- Compare actual vs expected results from unit operations
	- Industry benchmark comparisons for specific modalities
	- Proactive issue identification and mitigation recommendations
- Longer-term biological innovation (12-18+ months):
	- Developability/manufacturability predictions for molecules
	- Help prioritize which molecules to advance based on manufacturing ease

### Commercial Model & FTE Approach

- Insurance-like value proposition initially:
	- Reduce catastrophic batch failure probability from 20-40% to ~1%
	- Avoid 3-6 month delays and $5-10M additional manufacturing spend
- FTE model as entry point for CDMOs:
	- CDMOs are software-negative, AI-readiness consulting positive
	- Help implement digital tools (Veeva, Apprentice) and AI strategies
	- Consulting revenue generates learning, data, access to systems
- Process improvement for immediate ROI:
	- Address current manufacturing problems vs future risk prevention
	- Replace CMC consultant spend with Eitri platform + expertise
	- Partner with CMC consulting agencies for channel partnerships

### 2026 Success Metrics & Next Steps

- Biotech targets:
	- Land 3-5 batch record review use cases
	- Expand into process improvement and vendor selection/performance management
- CDMO targets:
	- Sell FTE consulting to 3-5 CDMOs (specialty and non-specialty)
	- Build embedded presence on both sides of biotech-CDMO relationship
- Q1 benchmarks:
	- Signed pilot agreements with initial biotech design partners
	- First CDMO consulting engagements launched
	- User adoption metrics defined for platform stickiness

### Action Items

- Quinn: Send follow-up note by end of week outlining specific Q1 success metrics and 2026 goals
- Emre/Sean: Keep eye out for potential Eitri prospects during JPM networking
