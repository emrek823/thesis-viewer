### Background & Experience

- Most recently at Together.ai (https://together.ai), not previously in healthcare
- Grew company from 15 to 80-100 people; $0 to $100M ARR in <1.5 years
- Transitioned from AI research to product lead role while working across company
- Previous experience:
	- Wemo (3 years) - ML engineer and tech lead
	- Built first sentiment model for multimodal transformer
	- Beat legacy system by 30%, expanded team to 70 people
	- PhD studies in reinforcement learning and robotics at Penn

### Product Focus & Market Need

- AI x Cancer Care focus driven by personal experience and market research
- Conducted extensive physician interviews:
	- Spoke with 50-80 oncologists
	- Only 2 doctors using OpenEvidence, not as power users
	- Found tools like ChatGPT/OpenEvidence have low usage in oncology
- Key differentiators from primary care:
	- Oncologists see patients for months/years vs single visits
	- Requires multi-step reasoning vs linear retrieval
	- Academic oncologists spend hours/weeks per patient
	- Community oncologists have shorter but still significant prep time

### Technical Architecture

- Hybrid approach combining multiple models:
	- Closed source models
	- Fine-tuned open source models
	- Oncology-specific embedding models
- Multi-agent execution for parallel tasks:
	- Drug database information retrieval
	- Clinical trial matching
	- NCCN guideline processing with footnote analysis
	- Missing data identification and physician queries

### Go-to-Market Strategy

- Initial partnerships with major cancer centers:
	- Scheduled meetings with Penn Medicine, MD Anderson, Tennessee Oncology
- Two-pronged approach:
	- Engage with smaller community practices for faster adoption
	- Build relationships with larger cancer centers
- Building credibility through:
	- 3 oncologist advisers (Stanford, Dana Farber, OSU)
	- Network of ~10 clinical partners
	- Conference attendance and KOL engagement

### Team & Fundraising

- Currently raising $1.5-2M
- 6-month hiring plan:
	- 2 technical hires (engineers/researchers)
	- Head of operations
	- Fractional CMO later in year
- South Park Commons involvement:
	- Member (no strings attached) vs Fellowship program
	- Potential for exceptional investment outside normal programs
- Seeking investors with:
	- Deep healthcare/oncology networks
	- AI understanding
	- Team building expertise

### Product Development Status

- UI iterations with physician feedback
- Backend under development
- Focus on data pipeline creation
- Building knowledge base integration
- Collecting external data sources
