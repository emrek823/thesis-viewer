## Slide 10: Case study 1: Informed Consent Creation

RIGHT.

### The Challenge:

CROs, sponsors and AMCs spend 15-40 hours of expert labor to generate a new Informed Consent Form for each new clinical trial, requiring an analysis of the protocol, investigative brochure and country specific regulations.

### Our Approach:

Ryght's Informed Consent Form generator, intelligently extracts key insights from foundational documents such as the protocol, IB, country regulations, and any pre-existing customer templates. User becomes an editor vs creator, and 18 hours of work turns into 2 hours. Make on the fly edits or use Ryght to redraft content.

**Section 1: Introduction**

You've been chosen to join a research study because you have a type of cancer that has either spread to other parts of your body or is in an advanced stage, but it's not a brain or central nervous system tumor, and you don't have untreated spinal cord compression. This study is for people like you who either haven't responded to the usual treatments, can't tolerate them, have decided not to use them, or have a type of tumor that doesn't have a standard treatment yet.

We're looking into a new treatment called RGT-519-023. It's given through an IV on the 1st, 8th, and 15th days of a 21-day cycle. You might also receive other drugs known as anti-PD-1/LI checkpoint inhibitors, which include Nivolumab (Opdivo), Pembrolizumab (Keytruda), Cemiplimab-rwlc (Libtayo), Avelumab (Bavencio), Atezolizumab (Tecentriq), and Durvalumab (Imfinzi). These could be used together with RGT-519-023.

If you have prostate cancer that's not responding to hormone therapy, hormone deprivation therapy might be part of your treatment. For any bone problems, you might get bisphosphonate or denosumab according to the guidelines where you're being treated. After you finish the first cycle of treatment, you can have radiation to help with painful bone lesions.

If you have side effects from the immune system or adrenal insufficiency, or if you have a flare-up of chronic conditions like asthma, COPD, or a rash, you might be given corticosteroids, but there's a limit on how much you can take.

Sometimes, you might need other treatments like radiation or surgery to help with specific medical issues. These are considered on a case-by-case basis and you would need to talk it over with the Medical Monitor.

If you have any questions or need more information about the study or treatments, please ask your study team. They're there to help you understand everything involved.

This Participant Information Sheet/Consent Form tells you about the research project. It explains the tests and treatments involved. Knowing what is involved will help you decide if you want to take part in the research.

Please read this information carefully. Ask questions about anything that you don't understand or want to know more about. Before deciding whether or not to take part, you might want to talk about it with a relative, friend or your local doctor.

Participation in this research is voluntary. If you don't wish to take part, you don't have to. You will receive the best possible care whether or not you take part.

If you decide you want to take part in the research project, you will be asked to sign the consent section. By signing it you are telling us that you:
*   Understand what you have read
*   Consent to take part in the research project
*   Consent to have the tests and treatments that are described
*   Consent to the use of your personal and health information as described.

You will be given a copy of this Participant Information and Consent Form to keep.

We're trying to see if our new medicine called RGT-519-023 works against cancer (specifically, how it affects the tumour).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Simplify Shorten Lengthen                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

## Slide 12: Case study 3: Extract and query unstructured data

RIGHT.

### The Challenge:

Billions of medical test results in un- and semi-structured format (EMR etc). High-value genomics test records are buried in fax, pdf and text fields without annotation; extracting insight is currently manual/impossible

### Our Approach:

Ryght created a custom extraction pipeline to identify genes included in each test, identify variants, list findings in a table, and surface relevant medical literature for the analyst based on the clinically relevant variants identified.

*(Images of various medical documents, including:)*
*   University of Medical Exeter School report
*   Quest Diagnostics Lipid Panel report
*   DIAGNOSTIC PATHOLOGY MEDICAL GROUP, INC. BREAST CANCER PROGNOSTIC MARKER REPORT
*   Guardant360 Tumor Response Map

**Example Data Extraction from a "BREAST CANCER PROGNOSTIC MARKER REPORT":**

**SPECIMEN(S) RECEIVED**
Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue,
right lung, EGFR mutation

**TEST PERFORMED**
Roche cobas® EGFR Mutation Test v2
on A12-3456-7B

**FINAL DIAGNOSIS**

**RESULTS**
Exon 19 deletion detected

**INTERPRETATION**
Deletions in EGFR exon 19 are associated with increased responsiveness to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. (Lynch TJ et al. N Engl J Med. 2004;350(21):2129-2139.)

**COMMENT**
Formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue was received and tumor regions were identified and selectively dissected. Following tumor enrichment, DNA was isolated using standard laboratory procedures. Multiplex real-time PCR was utilized to amplify regions of exon 18-21 within the EGFR gene. Following amplification, a set of 32 specific primers and probes was used to specifically detect normal and mutant sequences at 42 targets within this area of the EGFR gene.

As with any laboratory testing, there is the possibility of false negative or false positive results. However, extensive quality control and quality assurance programs are in place in this laboratory effort proper diagnoses. Please contact us if we can provide additional information regarding the molecular analysis. (CPT G0452)

## Slide 13: Ryght's "integration" to sites

RIGHT.

*   Ryght **never** uses site data to train models and **never** asks for or receives PHI
*   AI and IT groups at sites can **use Ryght SDK** and tools to **build copilots** on the Ryght platform
*   **No EMR integrations needed**
*   Your own dedicated, secure environment and copilots are web apps and ready to use from day one
*   Unlimited personnel can use the copilots if you are part of the Ryght network.
*   Fast access to future and upcoming new copilots ahead of others

## Slide 14: Benefits to Sites

RIGHT.

*   Give staff **hours back** every week
*   AI-driven, real time communication with CROs and sponsors for all studies
*   Ryght bring "Ryght Network" members **new trial opportunities** for consideration
    *   Copilots let us know you have the patients and capabilities
*   Visibility into PI, CRO, and **site performance**
*   More successful **trial options** for patients, with less time wasted, lower failure rates
*   More studies means **more revenue** with less cost
*   Ryght gets paid by sponsors and/or CROs from tech budget, and we **share revenue** with you where applicable.

## Slide 15: Next Steps

RIGHT.

*   Review site network agreement and execute
*   Assign stakeholder(s) to Ryght to guide requirements
*   Go live with appropriate copilots once deployed
*   Train research team on the use of copilots
*   Realize immediate efficiency benefits and new research options with Ryght
