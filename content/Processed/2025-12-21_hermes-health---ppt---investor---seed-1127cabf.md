## Slide 4: Identified Health Data is the Future
Identified Health Data is 10x More Valuable than De-identified Data.

### Value Comparison
**Identified Data: $150 to $300 per patient**
*   Enables direct patient-level action
*   Clear provenance
*   Clearly measurable ROI
*   Rich data profile

**De-Identified Data: $0.01 to $10 per patient**
*   Limited to population analysis
*   Unclear provenance
*   Hard to measure outcomes
*   Limited data profile

### Use Case Comparison
| Use Case | De-Identified | Identified |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Clinical Trials Recruitment** | Protocol design and feasibility | Qualify patients directly for a particular study |
| **Life Insurance** | Analyze broad health trends and mortality for actuarial models | Underwrite a specific policy for individual |
| **Health Care Operations** | Process optimization and benchmarking | Patient specific billing audit and fraud detection |
| **Life Sciences** | Aggregated health and outcomes research | Find exact source of an adverse event with full clinical context |

## Slide 5: Problem: Identified Data is Stuck in the Past
Access to Identified Data is Fragmented, Full of Friction, and Labor Intensive

**The Problem**
HIEs and TEFCA were designed to enable seamless health data exchange but in practice, its made it worse. Access to identified data is still full of friction:

*   **Fragmentation:** 1,000+ data custodians with limited footprint and coverage.
*   **Multiple Connections:** Requestors need multiple data sources to meet their needs.
*   **Friction:** Labor cost of $100 to pull one medical record.
*   **Confusion:** Varying channels to get medical records (fax, bespoke requestor portals, and limited APIs).

**Entities in Fragmented Ecosystem:**
Law Firm, Life Insurance, Patient Registry, CRO, Health Plan, Clinic, HIE, EHR, Claims, EHR, Hospital, ROI, Imaging.

## Slide 8: Network Effect & Value
Hermes Provides Value to Both the Requestor and the Custodian – Creating a Reinforcing Flywheel effect.

### Value Propositions
| Requestor | Custodian |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Faster Turnaround: More Revenue** Data comes back in minutes instead of weeks | **More Demand → More Revenue:** Hermes expands your digital intake funnel, making it easy for requestors to submit and receive records driving higher volume and revenue. |
| **More Data: More Revenue** More data enables Requestors to unlock new markets and use cases. | **One API → Lower Cost:** Hermes handles all requestor integrations through a single API, removing one-off builds and manual fax work to cut engineering and labor costs. |
| **Less Overhead:** One API to submit and retrieve identified health data no more bespoke connections, integrations, and maintenance. | **Rules Based Routing → Enforce Compliance:** Custodians set which request types they accept, and Hermes enforces those rules automatically for example, blocking malpractice requests. |
| | **Request Validation → Fewer Cancellations:** Hermes validates each HIPAA authorization before routing, reducing rejections and cancellations to improve margins. |

### Hermes Health Flywheel Effect
1.  More Requestors
2.  More Record Volume
3.  More Vendors Integrate to Capture Volume
4.  Faster and Easier Records

## Slide 13: Business Model
We have a Simple Business Model that Scales as our Network Grows.

*   Hermes monetizes the Requestors.
*   Hermes pays the Custodian on a per record or patient basis based on the dataset.
*   Gross margin is the spread between what we charge Requestors and what Custodians charge us.
*   As automation and network density grow, gross margins expand.

### Pricing Structure
| Category | Price | Gross Margin |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Annual Platform | $10,000 to $100,000 | 90% |
| Location (Claims) | $15 Per Patient | 66% |
| Record (End to End) | $50 Per Record | 20% |
| Record (Routing) | $5 Per Record | 80% |
| Patient Histories (RX + Medical Claims) | $50 Per Patient | 50% |

## Slide 14: Strategic Vision & Goals
To Win the Network we Must Execute on the Strategic Goals Below.

*   **Phase 1: Relevance (Build Atomic Network):** Build the smallest minimum viable network to validate requestor and custodian interest.
*   **Phase 2: Ubiquity (Achieve Requestor and Custodian Ubiquity):** Use the momentum to create network to create a self-reinforcing flywheel effect and gravitational pull. (**"We are Here"**)
*   **Phase 3: Scale (Expand to New Markets):** Use the network density to expand into more markets.
*   **Phase 4: Monetize (Unlock New Use Cases).**

*Confidential*

---

## Slide 15: MOAT
**Hermes Health’s Moat = Network Density × Neutrality × Economies of Scale × Product Velocity**

*   **Connection Density:** More Custodian connections mean fewer reasons for Requestors to build their own. Each reinforces the Network.
*   **Neutrality:** We don’t compete with Custodians or our Requestors. Our Neutrality builds trust and drives adoption. Our Neutrality is our Superpower.
*   **Economies of Scale:** More volume allows us to negotiate lower Custodian fees, enabling us to pass these savings to our Requestors.
*   **Products Velocity:** Our workflow innovations make data exchange seamless for Custodians and Requestors. This speed lets us outperform Networks of similar size with slower product cycles.

## Slide 16: Five Year - Annual Revenue Growth

**Financial Key Points**
*   Breakeven end of Year 2028
*   Gross Margin expands as integrations are expensive to create but cheap to maintain

## Slide 23: Why Now?
The De-Identified Data Market Created Comfort and Now to Grow is Expanding to Identified Use Cases

### Current Market Sentiment
| Custodians | Requestors |
| :--- | :--- |
| Built comfort exchanging de-identified data across 1,000+ sources | Largely unaware that health data can be traded or licensed |
| De-identified market however is mature and becoming commoditized | Still rely on fax and manual workflows |
| Growth pressure is creating push for new markets and use cases | Few know how to license or value health data |
| Limited knowledge of use cases that require identified health data (intentional cultural norm) | Lack technical, operational, and legal knowledge to implement and integrate with Custodians |
| Early APIs from Epic, Athena, Office Ally, Waystar starting to create data liquidity | AI agents accelerating need for compliant access to identified health data |

## Slide 26: Custodians Can’t Be The Center
**Why Custodians Can’t Be The Center**
*   **Competitive Conflict:** Partners compete with each other, making it difficult for any single partner to act as a neutral hub for all.
*   **Limited Footprint:** Individual partners have a limited footprint on a patient data record. As a result they cannot fulfill all requests.
*   **Trust:** Partners don’t trust each other and as a result hesitate to share proprietary information directly with each other, restricting cooperation.
*   **Complex Integration:** Direct connections among multiple partners create costly complexity, duplication, and labor.

## Slide 29: HIPAA Checker
**Problem: Incomplete HIPAA Authorizations**
*   Customer-submitted HIPAA Authorizations are frequently missing key elements required by providers.

## Slide 34: OCR & Text Extraction
**Problem: Image Based Document**
*   Sites often send documents back that are scanned image of text documents.
*   These documents are thus hard to work with since they are not text based document.

**Solution: Text Extraction & OCR**
*   **Text Extraction:** Extracts the raw text from the document allowing you to work with the underlying raw text.
*   **OCR:** Convert the image document into a text based PDF. It superimposes invisible ink over the text making it searchable.
