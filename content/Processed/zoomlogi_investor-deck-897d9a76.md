## Slide 1: ZoomLogi
# ZoomLogi
Visibility Recommendation Intervention
Exclusively for the Pharma Logistics industry

## Slide 2: Common Challenges Across the Logistics Value Chain...
### Common Challenges Across the Logistics Value Chain...
Issues shared by pharma and non-pharma logistics managers alike
### Limited Real-Time Visibility & Actionable Insights
*   **Fragmented Systems**
    Data silos, requiring managers to access various portals / systems for tracking and reporting
*   **Complex Provider Network**
    Managing data from a growing number of service providers and IoT devices leads to data overload
*   **Reactive Operations**
    Without clear, real-time shipment updates, teams are forced into reactive problem-solving
### $ Constant Effort to Improve Efficiency
*   **Resource-Intensive operation**
    Significant internal resources spent on ops, reporting and managing multiple integrations
*   **Communication Bottlenecks**
    Hrs on phone / email wasted due to outdated contact details (game of telephone)
*   **Non-Standardized Performance Metrics**
    Inconsistent data makes it difficult to select the best provider or location based on service / cost.

## Slide 3: ...Are amplified by the unique demands of Pharma logistics
### ...Are amplified by the unique demands of Pharma logistics
Failures in Pharma have higher stakes associated with product quality, regulatory compliance, and patient safety
*   **Temperature stability**
    Pharma products demand strict temperature control to ensure safety and efficacy. Any deviation can compromise product safety and efficacy.
*   **Time sensitivity**
    Fast delivery is critical to support research, clinical trials, and treatment, where delays can jeopardize patient outcomes
*   **Regulatory compliance**
    Pharma production, storage, and transport is tightly regulated by agencies. Non-compliance risks recalls, fines, and legal actions.
*   **Global complex supply chains**
    Pharma relies on intricate, global supply chains, increasing the risk of disruptions across borders and regulatory environments
*   **$ High cost and value of goods**
    With high R&D and production costs, each shipment can be worth millions, making losses from logistics failures financially significant

**$35B¹ in annual losses due to failures in temperature-controlled Pharma logistics**
