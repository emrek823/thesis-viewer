### Martin’s Background & Resonata Overview

- Former Invitrogen executive (grew from 100 to 10,000 people through Life Technologies to Thermo Fisher acquisition)
- Founded Cure Forward (genomic testing platform) - became expert in clinical trial matching
- Built automated trial matching system at Citizen for 2,000+ patients
	- Matches were always right
	- Had to resolve every edge case (CEO called it “kidney stone” process)
- 2+ years at Perleo building two-sided cardiology platform
- Realized matching rules apply across all therapeutic areas and therapy types

### Resonata Platform & Technology

- B2B API for patient-facing health apps (not building patient platform)
	- Giant universe of patient-facing apps that “all suck at matching”
	- White-label matching solution for existing platforms
- Dual revenue model: pre and post-approval biopharmaceutical customers
- Two-sided data challenge:
	- Orange side: Care options extraction/management from trials.gov, prescribing info
	- Purple side: Patient data through partnerships (Picnic Health, etc.)
- AI-powered extraction demo with Pembrolizumab
	- 173-page prescribing info → 33 targetable subgroups in 15 minutes
	- Would have taken Martin 4 days manually
- Decision moments focus: “Healthcare is about serving up right info to right person when decision moment happens”
- First customer: Quest Diagnostics for Haystack MRD test
	- Target moment: patient to surgical oncologist pre-surgery
	- “Make sure you show this to your surgical oncologist” intervention

### Fundraising & Next Steps

- Raising $4M for 18-month runway to Series A readiness
- Goal: $8M+ ARR by Series A
- 18-month roadmap:
	- Start with 2 therapeutic domains
	- Add 4 more domains in first 12 months
	- Focus on revenue growth months 12-18
- Current syndicate discussions with Bluemaker and others
- Late-stage CTO recruitment (former Fabric Genomics colleague)
- Co-founder: Rajni Natarajan (CEO at Clarified Health)
- Virtue to follow up with team discussion and potential second call with structured questions
