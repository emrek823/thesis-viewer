# 2025 year-end digital health funding overview: A tale of two markets

In a [turbulent](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/healthcare/our-insights/gathering-storm-2-0-succeeding-in-healthcare-despite-the-turbulence) year for [healthcare](https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertpearl/2025/12/15/healthcare-in-2025-a-year-of-chaos-confusion---but-little-improvement/) and the [broader market](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/25/business/economy/stocks-bitcoin-markets-risk.html), digital health started to feel less like a tremor of innovation and more like bedrock infrastructure. Top players cemented themselves as core infrastructure, while investors bankrolled rapid AI-fueled growth. Annual funding for U.S. digital health startups reached $14.2B, a meaningful 35% increase over [2024’s $10.5B](https://rockhealth.com/insights/2024-year-end-market-overview-davids-and-goliaths/) and the highest total we’ve seen since [2022](https://rockhealth.com/insights/2022-year-end-digital-health-funding-lessons-at-the-end-of-a-funding-cycle/). This wasn’t a return to the pandemic-era peak, but it was a growth year—thanks to AI exuberance, plus proof that startups are helping incumbents weather the storm and navigate coming change.

Under the headline of growth, a starker picture emerges: 2025 was a tale of haves and have-nots. On one side, AI-native upstarts attracted huge rounds at unprecedented speed, a handful of companies [broke the IPO drought](https://rockhealth.com/insights/h1-2025-market-overview-proof-in-the-pudding/), and private equity made major moves, signaling real bets on an emerging “winner” class. On the other, 35% of venture rounds did *not* represent a step-up in round (i.e., “unlabeled”1 raises). Coupled with the elevated pace of M&A, which included a number of distressed exits, suggesting many companies are still grappling with valuation overhangs from prior cycles while operating in a more competitive market.

What’s driving this divide? Across 2025, we continued to see select players maintain outsized influence: mega funds,2 a well-capitalized unicorn class, and incumbents. These are the [Goliaths we flagged last year](https://rockhealth.com/insights/2024-year-end-market-overview-davids-and-goliaths/), and their growing concentration of power is leading to a jockeying for influence at the top. New breakout companies are gaining significant market influence, sparking competition with incumbents wrestling to protect their role as healthcare’s backbone, plus the big foundation model companies looking for their [next frontier](https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-health/). For all others—the “David” funds and startups still competing for their place—the pressure is on to find a plan to survive in an intensifying market. Success may increasingly rely on catching the attention of a Goliath (or a David on the rise) as a partner, acquirer, or investor.

Here’s where these dynamics stand at the end of 2025, the numbers behind them, and what we’re watching as we move into 2026.

## 2025 market overview

2025 saw $14.2B in venture funding for U.S. digital health startups, with Q4’s $4.2B across 129 deals marking the highest quarter total we’ve logged since Q2 2022. The headline numbers show a market that, like the [broader VC market](https://pitchbook.brightspotcdn.com/d4/37/a316db99470a9887cdf61781a31b/2026-us-venture-capital-outlook-20637.pdf), has ticked up to a new normal around 36% above the pre-pandemic baseline (2019, adjusted for inflation).

But fewer companies are capturing this capital. Startups raised $3.7B more in 2025 than 2024, though deal count dropped by five percent (482 compared to 509 deals in 2024). Consequently, average deal size rose to $29.3M (up from $20.7M in 2024), and the median deal size budged from $10M to $12M. That average-to-median gap reflects the outsized influence of mega deals (raises over $100M) which accounted for 42% of all funding, the highest proportion since 2021 and nearly double last year’s share. Remove the top nine companies by 2025 dollars-raised and total funding falls below 2024.

## The (funded) haves: Mega fund port cos, AI, and wellness

Across 2025, we identified two variables associated with funding “premiums,” i.e., the characteristics of the startups or deals correlated with larger check sizes. Both are relatively intuitive, but the data shows how much they matter: mega fund participation and an AI focus each drive meaningfully larger rounds. Plus, wellness-oriented companies got a boost—and it wasn’t just Oura raising the [largest digital health funding round](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/14/oura-ringmaker-valuation-fundraise.html) we’ve seen since we began tracking venture funding in 2011.

***The “mega fund” moat***  
At the top of the market, 2025 saw 26 mega deals and 15 [newly-minted unicorns](https://halletecco.substack.com/p/your-2025-health-tech-recap-is-here) (up from just six last year). The “Goliath” investors topped the term sheets, with Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), General Catalyst (GC), and Kleiner Perkins all participating in at least five mega deals each. The capital concentration [we’ve seen since 2024](https://rockhealth.com/insights/2024-year-end-market-overview-davids-and-goliaths/) has only intensified.

With their large coffers, one might assume that mega funds have the largest imprint at the later stages, driving big dollars on the biggest deals. While true, the data also suggest that mega fund participation creates a durable premium on deal size across nearly all stages. We did a targeted analysis and found that when a16z and/or GC participated in a deal in 2025, the average deal size was larger than deals without their participation, and this delta grew as deal stages progressed. Take Series A, which saw an average deal size of $24.1M when a16z and/or GC was on the cap table, versus $18.9M without their participation, a difference of $5.3M. By Series D and beyond, the gap widens to near triple-digits at $93.6M.

Mega funds expect their portfolio companies to successfully use a larger amount of capital. The result is a bifurcating market. When mega funds do participate, they push up deal sizes and set benchmarks that ripple across the industry. For everyone else, this creates a widening gap: benchmark valuations are being influenced by a handful of outlier deals while the majority of startups compete for smaller checks from smaller funds, yet face the same sector-wide growth expectations.

***The AI of it all***

In addition to large funds driving larger deal size, AI is also pulling in a premium. Across 2025, 50% of deals were closed by “AI-enabled” companies,3 [matching](https://news.crunchbase.com/ai/big-funding-trends-charts-eoy-2025/) the broader VC market. AI-enabled digital health companies captured 54% of total funding (up from 37% last year) and commanded a roughly 19% premium on average deal size compared to companies not explicitly centering AI in their products and services.4 This was most pronounced at Series C, where startups commanded a 61% “AI premium.”

Is the premium warranted? On one hand, when looking cross-industry, AI companies’ revenue run rate is [growing faster](https://www.svb.com/globalassets/trendsandinsights/reports/sotm/state-of-the-markets-h2-2025-final.pdf) [than ever](https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/active-investors-backing-ai-stack-startups-eoy-2025/). Healthcare specifically is embracing AI at an impressive pace: [provider adoption](https://rockhealth.com/insights/ai-is-in-the-doctors-bag-and-primary-care-is-ready-to-use-it/) is [ballooning](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12202002/), sales cycles are [shortening](https://menlovc.com/perspective/2025-the-state-of-ai-in-healthcare/), and agentic AI is being adopted [faster](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai) in healthcare than many other industries.

On the other hand, capabilities can quickly turn from differentiators to commodities. New AI players face encroachment from [incumbents with existing client lock-in](https://rockhealth.com/rock-weekly/epic-goes-ape-art-penny-and-emmie/) as well as foundation model players [taking on](https://www.axios.com/2026/01/07/chatgpt-health-tab-apple-fitness-apps) healthcare opportunities. Further, many of the large LLM companies with deep pockets are willing to [subsidize AI adoption to grab share](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/how-long-will-cheap-ai-tools-last.html) (a clear parallel to [Uber in its early days](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2025/04/college-students-free-chatgpt/682532/)).

Then there’s the issue of timing. We saw funding velocity speed dramatically among a crop of AI-centric upstarts who compressed fundraising timelines from years into quarters. [Abridge](https://www.abridge.com/), [Hippocratic AI](https://hippocraticai.com/), and [OpenEvidence](https://www.openevidence.com/) each closed back-to-back mega rounds within months in 2025—[doubling](https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/24/in-just-4-months-ai-medical-scribe-abridge-doubles-valuation-to-5-3b/), [more than doubling](https://www.axios.com/pro/health-tech-deals/2025/11/03/hippocratic-ai-3-billion-126-million) or multiplying their valuations [6x](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/20/business/dealbook/openevidence-fundraising-chatgpt-medicine.html) across the year.

Racing through these rounds can make investors uneasy, as shorter gaps between raises leave less time to make durable progress. And AI companies are indeed [burning more cash](https://www.svb.com/globalassets/trendsandinsights/reports/sotm/state-of-the-markets-h2-2025-final.pdf) than their peers, yet investors continue to write big checks. That may reflect mounting pressure to “get in on” the AI race (at whatever cost) or confidence that AI itself can speed the path to product-market fit. Whether that bet pays off remains to be seen.

*“We need to get back to thinking of investor money like carbs and customer money like protein. When customers pay you, they’re saying your service is worth more to them than their cash. Investor capital on the other hand, especially when it comes too fast, can make it hard for management teams to stay disciplined about how they spend. Raising money is exciting, but it can’t short-circuit the hard work of understanding why the world doesn’t yet have your innovation and how that innovation is actually going to change it.”

***Wellness rises***

Given the advent of AI-driven infrastructure bets, 2025 saw the most funding dollars flow to companies in the clinical and non-clinical workflow spaces, jointly capturing 39% of total funding. But beyond infrastructure, companies in the fitness and wellness space shot to the top of investors’ wishlists. Fitness and wellness startups raised $2.0B across 44 deals, vaulting from the eighth-most funded value proposition in 2024 to third in 2025. [Oura’s](https://ouraring.com/?srsltid=AfmBOopreIgXmk7ptdXYsNMGr8pxr3civ3laxtVRfJ1MBW_8w7wv5o5p) $900M commanded nearly half that total, but even Oura aside, the category saw a 13% funding uptick, with companies like [Function](https://www.functionhealth.com/home-c?utm_source=google&utm_medium=Google&utm_campaign=20800990020&utm_content=%7Badid%7D&utm_term=function+health&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=20800990020&gbraid=0AAAAAqiw_KGxJZOdBHhxdugEUrW5sDf84&gclid=CjwKCAiA9aPKBhBhEiwAyz82JzU8SFrYj4eAPa3BIVX5WqxwwqIPKEio6qV45WyaUqnx4MtNFpynVBoCeOwQAvD_BwE), [Eight Sleep](https://www.eightsleep.com/), and [Nourish](https://www.usenourish.com/paid-google?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&nsh_cam=Nourish_Web_Search_Diabetes&utm_campaign=23098747880&utm_content=185376730446&utm_term=nourish&nsh_grp=185376730446&nsh_ad=778200833963&nsh_src=g&nsh_tgt=kwd-59236046&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=23098747880&gbraid=0AAAAABJhds4fbcklSqfYSlfYiq0LFLCj_&gclid=Cj0KCQiApL7KBhC7ARIsAD2Xq3CfNYEGTkY9KspuNnCY_ZJ0LjgqoilSWqdV_Nrk-4Fnoe49jExeHaMaAltsEALw_wcB) all taking in large raises.
