## 2026-01-06 — First Call

### Founder
> Score: 3

Tim has relevant fintech experience (OnDeck, Series B to IPO) but responses to differentiation questions were non-specific. When asked about competitive positioning and why Fincura wins, answers were vague. The origin story (brother-in-law's dental practice) is relatable but notably his brother-in-law isn't even a customer.

### Market
> Score: 3

RCM is a massive $150B+ space, but Fincura's actual addressable slice—EOB posting and ERA/EFT reconciliation for SMB practices—is a thin wedge. The 1.1M SMB practices narrative sounds big but the $13K ACV on commoditized workflow doesn't compound. Claims submission, denial management, and prior auth are where the margin lives.

### Tech
> Score: 3

No defensible technology. Tim acknowledged multiple times this is a "distribution play" not a tech play. The bank data integration and EHR connectors are table stakes. LLMs enabling faster EHR integration helps everyone equally—no proprietary advantage here.

### Why Now
> Score: 6

The tailwinds are real: post-COVID labor costs up 45%, insurance latency increased 13%, 62% of SMB practices increasing AI spend. Providers have always been cash-strapped, but the labor crisis is genuinely acute now. Giving benefit of the doubt on timing.

### Biz Model
> Score: 3

25-75 bps on payment volume is thin. The $11.5K ACV with 80% transaction / 20% SaaS mix means revenue scales with volume but margins stay compressed. No payer-side business model—all provider-side in a space where payers have the leverage. Compare to companies capturing 2-5% of recovered revenue on denials.

### Defensibility
> Score: 3

No moat today. Even the origin story customer (brother-in-law) isn't using the product. Bank data ownership is interesting conceptually but not proprietary—any fintech can get Plaid/MX integrations. Will get squeezed between:
- LightSpun (deeper SMB practice relationships)
- Athelas (RCM + devices + ambient)
- RCM rollups like Ease (captive distribution + AI)

## Key Risks
- No defensible technology or data moat
- Founder struggled to articulate clear differentiation
- Thin unit economics on commoditized workflow
- Competing against well-funded RCM consolidators with captive distribution
- SMB healthcare notoriously hard to sell into at scale

## Gut Check
**No** — Passing after first call. Risk across all six dimensions. At seed stage raising $4M, the bar is higher and we need to see at least one dimension scoring 7+. This has uniform 3s with only Why Now at 6.

## Pass Memo

We appreciate the time Tim spent walking us through Fincura. The team has relevant fintech experience and the SMB healthcare payment reconciliation pain point is real—practices genuinely struggle with EOB/ERA matching and the manual labor burden is significant.

However, we don't see a path to defensibility in this space. The reconciliation workflow, while painful, is increasingly commoditized as RCM platforms (Athelas, Tebra, legacy players) bundle it into broader offerings. The 25-75 bps pricing on a distribution play doesn't generate the margins needed to outpace well-capitalized competitors. We'd need to see either (1) a proprietary technology advantage, (2) a payer-side business model that captures more value, or (3) evidence of exceptional founder-market fit with rapid organic growth. The current traction ($30K MRR) is respectable but not escape velocity for a seed raise in this competitive landscape.

We wish Tim and the team the best and would be happy to reconnect if the business evolves toward a more differentiated position.
