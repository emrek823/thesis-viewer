* VIVJOA is a prescription medicine used to reduce the risk of vaginal yeast infections that keep coming back (recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis, RVVC) in females with a history of RVVC.
* VIVJOA should only be taken by females who are not pregnant and who are not able to become pregnant.
It is not known if VIVJOA is safe and effective in females who have not had their first menstrual period.

**Do not take VIVJOA if you:**

**Especially tell your doctor if you take medicines called breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) transporter substrates, including the cholesterol lowering medicine rosuvastatin.** Ask your doctor or pharmacist for a list of these medicines if you are not sure. Taking VIVJOA (a BCRP inhibitor) with BCRP transporter substrates may increase the risk of side effects with these medicines.
**Know the medicines you take. Keep a list of them to show your doctor and pharmacist when you get a new medicine.**

**How should I take VIVJOA?**

**What are the possible side effects of VIVJOA?**
* See "Do not take VIVJOA if you:" Females who are pregnant, are able to become pregnant, and females who are breastfeeding should not take VIVJOA.
**The most common side effects of VIVJOA are headache and nausea.**
These are not all the possible side effects of VIVJOA. For more information, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
**Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088.**
