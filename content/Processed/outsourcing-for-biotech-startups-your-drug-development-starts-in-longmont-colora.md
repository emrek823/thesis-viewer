Two Steps Forward, One Step Back: The Dance Toward IND Submission in Early Development

IND enabling

Innovation across the pharmaceutical industry has given way to a wide range of novel modalities, opening up new possibilities in patient care. Despite the industry’s evolving landscape, the success rate for drug candidates during early development continues to sit at only 10%.¹

The good news, though, is that when you understand the pitfalls that can impede early development, the associated risks can be effectively managed, ultimately driving your program and your organization toward long-term commercial success.

In a recent roundtable discussion, a panel of product development experts with diverse perspectives examined the blind spots that can plague an early development strategy, as well as which considerations must be accounted for when navigating the path toward an IND submission.
