### Company Background & Leadership

- Omar Salah founded MD Portals (healthcare IT company since 2016)
	- First customer: Landmark Health (value-based care pioneer with Adam Bowler)
	- Built technology pulling clinical records from all sources using NLP to find diagnosis gaps
	- Sold to Wartec after 2+ years, investors made 3x return
- Current team composition:
	- Omar: CEO with healthcare IT expertise since 2016
	- Adam Young: Former CEO of successful voice AI company, now Chief Product Officer
	- Rajeev: Finance background from Morgan Stanley, technology investing experience

### Nightingale’s Platform & Use Cases

- AI voice companion for vulnerable patients in value-based care
- Two primary patient categories:
	- Recent hospital discharges (6-week transition period)
		- Only 25% currently receive follow-up calls
		- AI checks medication compliance, mobility, appointment scheduling
	- Frequent ER visitors with multiple chronic conditions
		- Daily check-ins to prevent unnecessary readmissions
		- Builds ongoing relationship through consistent interaction
- Non-clinical application - extends clinical plan rather than making diagnoses
- Uses comprehensive patient context from medical records plus conversation memory

### Data Strategy & Competitive Advantages

- Leverages existing relationships with value-based care organizations
- Access to clinical data through treatment relationships (vs. payers spending billions on data vendors)
- Uses FHIR data vendor for comprehensive record aggregation
- Voice AI differentiation:
	- Specialized for elderly patient communication patterns
	- Handles interruptions and latency preferences for this demographic
	- Fine-tuned engagement strategies (referencing family memories, etc.)
	- Co-founder Dr. Karol Roeder was first care navigator in value-based care

### Market Position & White House Connection

- $10 billion addressable market in care management
- No direct competitors currently identified
- Invited to White House, running for CMS app release for all Medicare patients
- Champion: Amy Gleason (former Main Street head of product, now #2 to Dr. Oz at CMS)
- Strategic focus on value-based care due to Omar’s proven track record ($20M in 2 years previously)

### Next Steps

- Nightingale to send pitch deck over weekend
- Second 60-minute call scheduled if first call assessment positive
- Virtue VC process: 5-10 pre-call questions, then full diligence if proceeding
- Omar has self-funded to date, seeking rolling-sleeves partner who understands digital health
- Looking for seed-stage investment in Virtue’s sweet spot range
