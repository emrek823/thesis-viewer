# Assort Health - IT Manager at Luminary Hospice

Interview conducted on July 23, 2025

## Topics
Healthcare, AI capabilities, Call Routing, AI Component, EHR Integration, Patient Intake, Customization, Voice AI

## Summary
The Tegus Client, researching voice AI in healthcare, spoke with an expert from a hospice service company with over 10 locations in four states. Initially using Parakeet for call triaging, they switched to Assort Health for its better AI capabilities and integration with their EHR system. Assort Health handles about 5,000 calls annually, costing over $150,000, with customization tailored to patient profiles. The expert highlighted the challenges of switching to a cheaper solution due to customization and integration difficulties, and discussed potential ways for Assort Health to generate additional ROI and become a core OS for non-clinical operations in the future.

## Expert Details
* IT Manager at Luminary Hospice. The expert can discuss being a key decision maker during the evaluation process of Assort Health.
* Current IT Manager at Luminary Hospice.
* Former Health Information Technology (HIT) Manager at Tennessee Primary Care Association, leaving in October 2024. Responsible for the 29 federally qualified health centers throughout the state of Tennessee, that are members of the primary care association. The expert conducted thorough assessments of each FQHC to identify needs related to health IT implementation and Meaningful Use, Electronic Health Record (EHR) platforms, Health Information Exchange (HIE), and telehealth. This includes providing education, coaching, and training in the evaluation, selection, implementation, and maintenance of information systems to ensure each health center optimizes its investment in operational HIT systems.
* Prior to the Tennessee Primary Care Association, the expert was the Clinical Systems Admin, EMR Specialist at Community Health Systems. The expert managed administrative processes, inventory, disaster recovery, research, outreach on new and emerging technologies, outsourced solutions, and operational monitoring of IT resources. The expert administered all onsite support for physicians and staff of the medical group as IT support and professional development for all technology resources related to computers, handheld devices, printers, phones, and clinical EMR (electronic medical records).

**Q: Please rate familiarity of each from 1-5 with 5 being most familiar.: Assort Health, Parakeet Health, or Elise AI before. Are you a current customer of any of these solutions? (please specify)**

**A:**
* Assort Health - 5 (Yes, currently in use or previously evaluated)
* Parakeet Health – 4 (Previously a customer)
* Elise AI - 1 (General awareness, but not a user)

**Q: Were you the final decision maker to bring on this solution? If not, were you a part of the evaluation process? When was it you made this decision (year)?**
**A:** I was part of the evaluation team that assessed Assort Health in late 2024. While the final decision was made collaboratively with leadership, I provided the IT and operational readiness analysis that informed vendor selection.

---

**Q: Please provide an example of how you use or have used this product and how it relates to your current or previous position.**
**A:** At Luminary Hospice, we explored Assort Health to streamline inbound patient calls, triage after-hours needs, and reduce clinician call burden. I was responsible for the technical review, implementation scoping, and integration considerations with our EHR (MatrixCare). It played a key role in our strategy to scale patient support operations without linear staff growth.

**Q: What other competing solutions did you evaluate?**
**A:** We evaluated several alternatives, including Parakeet Health, Well Health, and traditional call center outsourcing models with human agents.

**Q: How often do you use or interact with the AssortHealth product?**
**A:** While I do not directly use the product day-to-day, I work closely with our operations team to monitor its performance and address integration or workflow adjustments as needed. My involvement is typically weekly through oversight, vendor check-ins, and feedback loops from end users.

**Q: What is your approximate annual spend with AssortHealth?**
**A:** $150k-$200k range.

**Client**
Thanks for taking the call. I'm researching the voice AI space within healthcare. Maybe to kick things off, could you just give me a brief background on yourself.

**Expert**
Sure. I lead the technology operations, all the infrastructure strategy for our growing company, trying to lead and support that progression as we continue to grow as a hospice service and company across multiple states. Over this past year, I've worked with our team establishing relationships and also in my role, working with vendor teams and making sure that we have those right relationships for our clinic groups, our administrators, for those scalable systems to optimize those workflows, to continue to evaluate technology as IT and invest in those and implement them as we see that are appropriate for both that patient experience that we're trying to, of course, keep top of mind, but also for those efficiencies internally of what we're doing. I've been doing this for close to 20 years now with all different parts of the EHR optimization and IT support, and really leading in now into the AI driven type of solutions that are out there.

**Client**
Got it. Could you just give me an overview of how large your organization is, how many states it is, etc.?

**Expert**
Right now, we are growing quickly. We're at the point now that we've just passed over 10 locations, some officially online. We're in, thinking at the top of my head, one, two, three, four different states at the moment with plans in the future, you know, as we continue to see how that expands with how we serve patients in different markets. We have close to over 100 users inside of our organization and serving patients as part of that in several of those locations already, and spinning up a patient list that we're starting to serve here at all these other locations.

**Client**
Got it. Is our understanding that you first adopted Parakeet and then switched to Assort, is that correct?

**Expert**
Yes. It was about trying to align the IT systems with needs and making sure we had all of those different

---

types of solutions that could make it as streamlined as possible, especially with a decentralized workforce. We've got clinicians and hospice aides and administrators and coordinators, intake type coordinators, but they're across different offices in different states. There's different types of levels of the organizational structure that are possible depending on what market you're in, as far as local talent and being able to procure consistencies.

That's in all different roles, not just for patient intake and so on, but clinicians, hospice aides, everything. It's hard to find good talent. It was looking at how can we optimize those pathways of communication for intake, for patient intakes and outbound communication with their families, and so on.

We started looking at a solution last year, around early fall last year, up until the end of the year that we would give ourselves a kind of a short turnaround to see if we could look at a solution that was Parakeet, that eventually it turned out into Parakeet of AI powered that could triage calls and route calls more efficiently. Our call volumes were increasing exponentially. But our headcount of internal staff to keep up with those calls was not growing as quickly. We wanted to make sure we had the right type of solution in place to make sure we could keep up with that demand.

**Client**
Could you just describe what kind of calls you're trying to automate? What is the most common kind of call since we understand hospice is a little bit different than your typical provider?

**Expert**
It was about trying to get those kinds of calls that had to do with intake. With hospice, it's a little different. To your point, what was coming in? I'm trying to give you a best summary of what those calls were like. Different types of calls as far as, especially patient care and how that process would start, but the different places, that type of patient care that had to do with starting that process of getting things in place for hospice. It was about visit schedules for some of those patients who were coming from different nursing facilities that already had a set schedule for their hospice care and how we would be taking the lead on that going forward.

Whether that came from home health, from a nursing home or VA, or another hospital that was discharging a patient to then have us take over hospice care. A lot of them had to do with coordinating follow up calls with those patients already in our network when it came to delivering equipment for them or medication refills or things of that nature that were repetitive and not necessarily urgent, but we're tying up a lot of our staff that were stretched thin very quickly of what needed to happen pretty urgently, not super urgent, but in a timely manner for these patients.

Also, a lot of after-hours when it came to triage after hours and escalating those situations, of course healthcare doesn't stop. We have very specific schedule of normal business hours, but the healthcare doesn't stop. We have some aides who work 24/7, 365 are on call. Making sure that we had those availabilities through that platform to take in those calls and make sure that they were addressed accordingly.

Whether it was follow up aid that was needed by a patient or hospice where the home health aide wasn't on site but needed a follow up visit for whatever it was, things of that nature, and maybe even some questions from the patients and their families of things to look out for. Of course, hospice being end of life type of service of what would be things to look up for as a follow-up when the home health aide nurse wasn't exactly on site at that particular time. A lot of new patient intake and referral calls to start establishing those visits.

Last but not least, any type of emotional support and just making sure that somewhat, a service assistant was in place to be that front facing for that type of support and then routing those calls to our human support staff as necessary.

**Client**
Interesting, so you had the AI doing emotional support calls?

---

**Expert**
At least to start that process of reassurance based on what some prompts that were being responded to by the patients of is this normal, I'm starting to see some changes in the patients' behavior and so on, and how it could escalate from there. Even questions like, what if their diet or their eating habits have changed here recently? There was a change in behavior and how they were eating and so on. We try to handle those through that same system, but at the very least have someone to intercept those calls and then forward it to whoever needed to be forwarded to as a human support for healthcare after hours, especially as necessary.

**Client**
Got it. Can you walk me through how you first evaluated Parakeet? Did you look at any other solutions in that initial fall evaluation? If so, why did you choose Parakeet?

**Expert**
We looked at a few different solutions. Parakeet came up as a good option because of previous feedback from customers that we had heard about Parakeet and how it was a good solution, and it was something that came up with a good stack of what it was able to accomplish. WELL Health Inc. was another one. WELL Health Inc. was more about messaging features and services with more live agents, and each one of them had their pros and cons.

It was the AI capabilities of Assort Health that really took us in that direction. We made sure that our Parakeet Health relationship was short lived. I mentioned end of last year until the very end of the year before we evaluated, are we going to go further in with Parakeet rather than look at another solution? That deeper AI component with Assort Health is really what made the difference in our decision.

**Client**
Got it. You did adopt Parakeet first. In the initial evaluation, you didn't evaluate Assort, and then later on, you heard about Assort and churned off of Parakeet. Is that correct?

**Expert**
Correct.

**Client**
Got it. Can you just walk me through how long did it take to implement Parakeet, and what were the issues that you found in it?

**Expert**
After we started that, even if it was a short turnaround, we went through a phased implementation of about 30 days each. We started this process the end of August and by the end of October, gave ourselves a good window to be able to a good 60-day window to see how that would go. We started with one of our sites, used it as a pilot, and worked closely with that vendor on scripting different scenarios as part of patient call intake. Especially, it calls after hours for, like I mentioned, family members calling in, reporting certain symptoms or signs of concern from their patient, and also for if there's requests for follow-up appointments or follow-up visit, and things of that nature.

We assisted Parakeet in developing that call routing configuration, any network settings that were required and system permissions to make sure that that was all set within our calls, our phone system as well, and then just documenting and really implementing the standard operating procedures and making sure when a human hand-off was necessary, especially for the most sensitive cases as part of hospice care, and putting all that into place in about 30 days.

We would have a call each week after that to look at reviews of performance and experience and so on. We use a lot of our internal teams feedback to just get a gauge of how that was going and follow-up of what would be next with Parakeet.

Like I said, after that 30 days and thereafter where we gave ourselves that 60-day window 60, a little more

---

than 60 days to really see what it could do. It became clear that it was best to go with that AI component, but the implementation process was pretty quick with Parakeet. It just didn't align exactly with what we needed in the big picture.

**Client**
Could you just go into more detail? What do you mean the AI component is better. Our understanding of Parakeet is also an AI patient engagement platform.

**Expert**
They had the AI component, but we just saw with the initial experience with Parakeet, it was not going to scale like we wanted. Even with the AI component, it was not going to scale like we wanted. We then heard soon after our implementation about Assort Health. It just seemed like it was because of our bigger plans and the capabilities of Assort versus Parakeet at scale that it was going to be a better solution. Not just AI, but from the size component, go with Assort rather than Parakeet.

**Client**
How did you know that Parakeet was not going to scale the same way? What do you mean by that?

**Expert**
It was more of that direct consumer to employee or live person within Parakeet and just of how things were outlined and explained to us of what their resources were. This was not just a decision that I made. This is also from leadership, where it became pretty clear that there was going to be a turning point where we were going to get a bit bigger than what Parakeet would be able to handle as far as numbers, as far as different locations online.

It would have been okay for quite a while because we don't plan on scaling to that certain size that I keep talking about for the next two or three years. In the big picture, could we have kept Parakeet for a good while and have it efficient? Absolutely. We didn't want to go through the process of doing Parakeet now and then another solution later.

Even if we start much smaller with a different solution, Assort Health now, it'll pay off in the long run as the better solution. It's just the stack of capabilities within Assort Health, especially with the AI component which became top of mind for us very quickly, especially how the world is changing, that's the arms race now. Everybody is very much investing in AI, trying to implement things with AI. It's really becoming a very good solution for us, for healthcare in general, when I mean us. We're looking at bigger scale. Parakeet was doing just fine for now, but in the bigger picture it was not going to be exactly what we needed and that was the collectiveness, leadership as well.

**Client**
I'm trying to understand from a product perspective what these companies actually do. How is Parakeet any different from Assort Health?

**Expert**
The biggest difference is that when we were able to do that with adaptability with AI, there was a different set of unique parameters for that. With Assort Health that Parakeet didn't have as far as specifics when it came to priority level of what to do with certain patients, the conversational quality of the AI was much better with Assort Health. It has a better capability of recognizing the intent of the patient's outreach of communication. It doesn't get too mixed up or held up on the health-related terms. We tested it extensively in live and sandbox situations to make sure it could understand a wide range of clinical terminology.

To be quite honest, when it comes to different cadence and communication styles of our patients, we serve some rural areas as part of the different agencies that we have, and the way they communicate is a little different in each one of those geographical locations. We really tried to make sure we didn't have situations where like, "I'm sorry, I'm not understanding what you're saying. Could you repeat yourself?" or "I'm having trouble being able to process or assist at the moment. Please hold while we get you to a live agent," things

---

like that.

That communication piece was important for us. Another piece that was very important for us was Assort Health was much better in getting some APIs and things set up with our EHR that we use, MatrixCare, which we also had a few hiccups in how we were able to implement that with Parakeet. It was more of a manual process, and Assort Health was much more streamlined in how it was able to do that.

**Client**
Could you go into detail there? How was Assort Health more streamlined than Parakeet? What did Assort Health do versus what a Parakeet did for integration?

**Expert**
The APIs and the communication that was able to come back from MatrixCare into the platforms when it comes to patient information, patient history, communication, contact information, all of those things, that was very much a plug and play type of experience with Assort Health. It was a lot more of exporting data and CSV files, and verifying the export and things like that when it came to the Parakeet experience. It just didn't play as well in that one-to-one communication between EHR and this platform. In that case, it was more of a manual type process, not APIs and direct interface.

**Client**
Got it. How impactful was that on your implementation period? Because of that, was Assort able to get implemented a few days quicker, or do you have any way to quantify that?

**Expert**
It was about half the time. For example, it took us close to three and a half weeks to do that with Parakeet because of that manual process and going back and forth and verifying and all the different things that had to do with that, which was tolerable and manageable, and it was what it was. You compare almost a month in that particular case, right after a week, right under 10 days with Assort Health. It was less than half of the time.

**Client**
That's really impressive. I know that you're using Assort Health. How has that experience been? Have you had any early indications of ROI or any early feedback?

**Expert**
So far, it's been going well and the early feedback and the experience overall has been very good on the performance of the platform. ROI has been very good as far as we understood the initial investment that was going to be necessary. Like I said that overall, it'll pay off in the long run as we scale. It's been very constructive to see the differences of how it handles for patient intake, the operational efficiency.

It's been obvious the amount of calls that are being routed immediately to live staff that can make sure that they're handled by that platform. The after-hours included in that, it's given great feedback from callers. We've been able to do a few different high-level surveys from our patients of how that part of our business has gone and they've given us good feedback for it.

There's been a couple of things of customization that we've gone back to Assort Health about, like I mentioned, when it comes to patient cadence and more details of what it's doing for patient intake and so on. There's been a quick turnaround from them, Assort Health, from the company on those requests that we've made.

**Client**
Approximately how many calls does Luminary take in a year maybe, and how many of those does Assort handle?

---

**Expert**
In about a month, collectively for each one of our clinics, and putting that together, I would say it's over 1,000 calls.

You multiply that by 12, and we're getting a good percentage of those, especially after hours. I would say about 20% of those after hours, so that's what, over $200 a month times 12. If my math isn't off, over 2000 calls a year just in after-hours and some during the regular business hours which is, I would put it about 5,000 calls a year that are being handled by Assort Health.

**Client**
Got it. How much do you pay a year to Assort Health for those 5,000?

**Expert**
Yeah, so our spend right now is right over $150,000 a year. Of course, we're early on in the relationship, so that translates into a monthly expense that we have about over $12,000.

**Client**
Got it. How many patients do you guys see?

**Expert**
We see over 100 at the moment. That number is growing. Right now, if we're multiplying that by the agencies, we're under 1,500 patients a year today. That's going to change considerably, but that's where we're at today.

**Client**
Got it. Can you just talk a little bit more about the customization? How bespoke is the Assort Health workflow that they have built for you and all the customized features? How difficult would it be to switch to another solution and replicate that customization?

**Expert**
The customization experience was good. It was very positive. The customization, like I mentioned earlier, was more about understanding the different pieces of our patients, profiles, characteristics, and so on. A customization also had to do with the call routing process and the call-routing logic, if you will, is where calls were being routed as part of that initial intake based on the office hours of when the patient was calling, location they were calling from, and what intention the caller had of what service they were trying to procure.

Defining those rules based on the time of day, calls are coming in at 10:00 A.M. versus 10:00 P.M. What happens if it's coming into our office, one of our offices in Ohio versus what's happening if it's coming into one of our offices in Texas to make sure that the right escalation protocols were followed for that call routing.

We created call routing trees and prioritized calls based on what patients were calling in and if it was a new patient, what happens then versus the known and established patient, and where that process goes based on the information that it was pulling from the EHR and the different things in the patient note and patient history of care?

If it's symptom related, what happens versus just follow up questions, what happens and then eventually, if necessary, how that gets routed and to which on-call nursing pool of available staff where that call goes and making sure that all comes from a top level from Assort Health, but then making it very specific to the different markets based on who's calling from and from where.

We also worked on the voice prompts and the tone of how those calls are received to make sure it's with empathy and appropriate for the setting and the phrasing of those prompts, and make sure it was based on compassion and the human element, and not just very traditional of a help desk type of, "Please state your issue and why you're calling," and be more mindful of "We're here to support you, please let us know how we

---

can help you today," things of that nature.

It was a good process of how that was implemented as well and being able to customize some of those things. Last but not least, some of those triggers for escalation of different things that might be keywords said by that caller of "Well, I'm calling because my patient, my loved one is looking or acting confused or shortness of breath," or anything like that. Escalation based on some of those responses.

If the customization also didn't happen through the AI, then immediately it would want to transfer that to a live person, again, to not interrupt or delay care and being able to customize some of those situations as well and then being able to go back and get feedback and customize that even further based on our staff feedback. Assort Health was very good and very quick to respond to those and very capable of additional customizations in that regard.

**Client**
Theoretically, if another vendor approached you with similar product functionality to Assort at a price point 50% lower, how would you respond? Would these customizations make it really difficult to switch, or would you likely migrate to that cheaper solution?

**Expert**
Yeah, those customizations would make it difficult to switch. I think I heard your number correctly. Even if it was at a 50% less, it would be difficult for a couple of two-pronged of the reasons why we would probably not go with that other option even with that reduced expense. Number one is that customization piece and having that already very much built out with Assort Health and how that transfers and having to start over and build that back up again. two) is the integration and the optimization of how that communicates back with our EHR.

I mentioned the challenges with Parakeet prior to that, how much that was a manual process, and that was very much streamlined with Assort Health. With experience that I've had with vendors, it's very much they can promise you everything, but then it's not necessarily the same case when the rubber meets the road of actually putting it into action. Having that being a proven process with Assort Health and then even if it's with another solution that's a lot less expensive, not knowing for sure if that's going to be as streamlined would be a real stop for us of wanting to do that because of the challenges of not having that seamless integration with our particular EHR.

**Client**
Helpful. What else can Assort Health do to broaden out their platform in a way that generates additional ROI for you? If they were to think about product expansion initiatives, what ideas would you give their team?

**Expert**
We're going to continue to do that when it comes to how they're able to develop more comprehensive and continuously learning type of scripts and prompts based on patient feedback and how they can expand that part of their platform with the AI capabilities of what happens here versus what the response is from whatever patient or how you escalate this, how you escalate that. How you continue to work on your escalation triggers, and how do you continue to iterate as a platform based on what the circumstances of care are? That said, I don't see any reason why they won't continue to innovate in that regard.

That's one of our biggest points and probably the biggest deciding factor, along with the optimization integration piece with our EHR in continuing with them for the long term is how they continue to demonstrate that they're able to continue to adapt and learn, and grow that part of their platform.

**Client**
Super helpful. Just one last question on my end. What do you think Assort becomes in five years? Will it still remain a very solid high ROI intake calling tool, or do you think it becomes a broader platform that basically becomes the core OS of non-clinical operations?

---

**Expert**
It's possible that it becomes something like the core OS for future operations. I think that something to the effect of like a full scale, intelligent learning type of front door for healthcare organizations. Of course, several different ones that aren't just hospice of what we're talking on here, but in the call handling aspect in knowing that for patient navigation and expanding a bit more into the different platforms for communication.

Of course, texting and live chat is different than phone call. Expanding there maybe some more predictive components to their AI that could dictate or that could lead their scripts and further developing that and really having the opportunity to use some of those analytics based on the experiences that the platform is having for better driving some of those clinical protocols and compliance being a component of that. I'm just thinking, there's a lot of potential there.

I see big things for them in the future if they continue, like I said a minute ago, to innovate the way they're innovating, just learning more about the patient intake, the experience, how they can use that to automate, streamline, really be a platform for this type of service and not just a solution that augments what we're doing with our different programs, including our EHR.

**Client**
Well, thank you again for your time today. This was very helpful. Bye.
