## Slide 1: Customer Reviews

### Lacie

What you guys are doing is nothing short of a miracle. I feel heard and validated, which hasn't happened for years! This isn't a cure but it puts you in control of your body and how to properly help it instead of yet another doctor telling you "it all looks good, probiotics wouldn't hurt to add to your routine" I'm so excited for this research and so glad I chose your company over others.

This is marvelous! I never knew so much about my vaginal health and got recommendations to help get it back to normal. Worth every penny for all this information.

### Jess

Almost everything was so very helpful & life changing. I just started getting a bit impatient at the tail end of the process. I had marked down the day that I was sure to have the results, but they ended up coming a day later. You can't rush a good thing. I got more answers than I ever got going to an obgyn it's crazy. At first the price you kind of hesitate, but when your out of of options & your husband is complaining about you down there! You pay the money!! So glad there is this service now. Please never close down. The women of the world need this! I was surprised at some of my results, & started doing what they suggested immediately. I have seen improvements since. I plan to do another sample next month to check if the numbers really match what I feel now. Thank you, can say that enough.

My reason for the 4 star review and not a 5 star is the directions.

The directions say to wait 24 hours after using probiotic suppositories, gels or creams etc in the vagina to test. However if you are someone that is trying to rebuild your biome after an infection or antibiotic use, the EVVY team recommended waiting 3 weeks after probiotic suppository use to gage growth/adherence and waiting 3 months after starting oral probiotics to gage growth/adherence.

If you are someone trying to track lactobacillus (good bacteria) growth in the vagina and looking for more than the current state of your biome this information needs to be included on the directions.

Thank you for all the work you do and making strides in women's health!
Bless you!
