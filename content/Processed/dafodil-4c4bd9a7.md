### EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Market Overview

US healthcare spend as a percentage of GDP has increased from 5% in 1960 to 20% today. Currently the US:
*   Ranks the highest in healthcare spend amongst OECD countries
*   Spends twice as much as other developed nations on healthcare.
*   Ranks the last in healthcare efficacy or quality of outcomes.

Our goal is to democratize healthcare pricing - by designing, building and offering pricing solutions that are affordable, simple, easy to use and easy to understand.

### Why Now?

The current Pricers in the market - both in-network (INN) and out of network (OON) were built decades ago on archaic technology - they are not responsive, configurable, modular or intelligent. The recent Provider Price Transparency and TiC regulations has resulted in an influx of pricing data in the public domain. In addition, the network contracts between Payors and Providers have begun to increase in complexity. This trend is expected to persist partly because of the availability of pricing data and partly because of the rise of High Performing Narrow Networks & Value Based Care. Also, the fee for out of network (OON) repricing at '% of savings' or even at $1.05 per claim for Medicare+ is egregious in a world where a "Google Search" costs a fraction of a cent.

In this context, we believe there is an opportunity to build a new kind of Pricing Platform in the cloud, using modern data architecture and AI/ML to price claims more accurately & quickly and, use modern LLM technology & models to provide coherent explanations to the providers that are fair, complete & accurate.

### How will we start?

We have identified 2 very specific pricing solutions that will serve as the beachhead for our mission a SAAS based configurable pricing engine focused on OON claims and complex fee schedule claims.

We have verified the market need for the solutions with 57 customer & industry expert conversations. We have lined up customer sponsors who want this solution and are willing to build this with us [Reference calls can be set-up post term sheet, upon request].

### Market Size:

While the market for a modern disruptive pricing engine & platform that can price all types of claims quickly and cost effectively is large - we want to focus our attention specifically on our 2 initial use-cases.
*   **OON Claim Repricer:** The OON cost containment market is estimated at $2.7B to $2.9B and is growing at 7 to 8% per annum. In addition, the RBP market is estimated at $300M to $420M and is estimated to grow at 12 to 18% per annum for the next 5 years.
*   **Complex Fee Schedule Pricer:** The pricing market segment for complex fee schedules is small today at about $100M to $250M. However, given the publication of pricing data, the growth of HPN and Custom Networks at

12 to 15% YOY and the increasing adoption of VBC (CAGR of 20.3%), we believe it is an opportune time to enter the market with a modern pricing solution and grow with it.

### What is our Vision beyond the 2 Solutions?

We believe there is a verified market opportunity to build a $100M to $200M business based on the 2 very specific applications we have identified above. However, our goal is to bring sanity to the rising cost of healthcare in the country. We don't believe this is possible with 1 or even 3 point applications. Our product vision goes beyond the applications themselves:

To build a robust, modular, scalable, configurable, API-ready, intelligent pricing engine or platform that will enable the build, hosting & execution of multiple pricing applications including - OON claim repricer, complex claim pricer, performance benchmarking, network analytics & performance evaluation, pricing data-as-a-service, consumer cash-price search, employer intranets, etc. The objective will be to also allow III party companies (vendors, Payors, TPAs, Providers) to build pricing & analytics applications on this platform.

### Competitive Landscape:

The market currently has a range of pricers on both the INN and OON market segments. The INN pricers include Optum, Burgess, 3M and Micro-Dyn. These pricers while very scalable and cost effective for most INN claims are not equipped to handle the rising complexity of bundled pricing, VBC claims and claims resulting from DCE or Narrow Networks. The OON pricers include MultiPlan, Zelis, Cotiviti, Amps amongst others. These pricers are technologically archaic and incredibly expensive when compared to what is possible with technology today.

### Capital Raise & Use of Proceeds:

We are raising a $5M seed round to help us achieve the following milestones:
*   Demonstrate clear "value delivery" based on measurable outcomes to 3 customers and generate booked ARR of $750K
*   Show clear broader "product:market" fit by building a broader pipeline of prospects.
*   Develop a detailed and specific plan that demonstrates how we plan to leverage our early success with our first two applications to build a broader & more powerful industry leading pricing platform that will help us in our mission of democratizing US healthcare pricing.

We believe achieving the above objectives will help us raise $20M in a Series A to enable the continued pursuit of our mission.
