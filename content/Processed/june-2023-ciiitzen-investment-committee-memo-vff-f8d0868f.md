# Ciitizen Investment Committee Memo

**Deal Team:** Mike Dixon, Akhilesh Samant, Nick Briguglio

**June 2023**

## Transaction Context

Ciitizen is a patient consented data business focused on rare and ultrarare conditions. Transformation evaluated the company's Series B in Spring 2021 and socialized terms. The business was instead sold to Invitae for $125M Cash + $200M Stock + $230M RSUs for retention of senior management. Since the acquisition, Invitae's stock is down 95% and Invitae has been forced to reorganize, extend runway, raise capital, and manage near term debt obligations. Though Invitae sees its data business as a long-term growth driver, the internal resources and investment allocated to Ciitizen are insufficient to run the business successfully. Resultingly, Farid Vij (CEO of Ciitizen) reached out to the Transformation team to discuss our appetite to carve out Ciitizen from Invitae.

After a few months of internal consensus building, we launched a 2–3-week diligence sprint to submit an IOI for the transaction. Since then, we have negotiated and signed the IOI, which kicked off an additional 3-4-week diligence period. We now have a decision to make on whether we move forward to confirmatory diligence and close.

## Recommendation

The Ciitizen deal team recommends we move forward to confirmatory diligence, kicking off legal diligence and drafting to move to close.

Since our initial investment committee meeting, we have conducted 3 warm reference calls with customers and prospects, 1 expert network call with a prospect, 3 warm reference calls with advocacy groups, and additional follow up work on GTM, long-run value capture, unit economics, team, and management's operating budget. This builds on the significant diligence done prior to the IOI, during our initial evaluation of the business, and our thematic views on this category.

Overall, we believe that this is a unique opportunity to back the market leader in what we think will be the next wave of real-world data, starting with a focus in a large and important therapeutic category — the collective body of rare diseases. Despite significant situational complexity, we are excited to move forward because Ciitizen's market leadership among patient advocacy groups sets up structural advantages to prosecute a compelling land and expand GTM, with highly efficient unit economics enabled by sophisticated technology.

## Deal Construct

Transformation is catalyzing an asset purchase to separate Ciitizen and Invitae, while capitalizing Ciitizen with $50M of new capital to operate as a standalone business. Transformation will contribute $30M of the $50M round, with the remainder allocated to financial syndicate partners and biopharma strategic investors.

The new financing provides Ciitizen approximately three years of runway, with $1.3-1.5M of monthly burn at close. Under Farid Vij's (CEO) leadership, the company is significantly more focused on its strategy, building density by disease area with deliberate expansion, and has markedly improved unit economics vs. two years ago.

At close, Transformation will own 30% of Ciitizen at an effective pre-money of ~$39M and an effective post-money of ~$100M. To align management and Transformation's incentives, 30% of employee ownership, representing 12% of total company ownership, will vest based on performance milestones, pegged to a 3x, 4x, and 5x MOM return at exit to Transformation. Assuming management vests on all performance options, meaning Transformation returns a 5x+ MOM, our effective post-money on this investment will be ~$114M. See Appendix B for additional detail on ownership and performance option vesting.

We've aimed to negotiate ownership, price, and structure to reflect a blend between a Series A and a Series B, which we believe appropriately reflects the reality of this company. On one hand, Ciitizen has a high-quality management team, using sophisticated technology to serve a strategic market, with de-risked product development and unit economics, reflecting a Series B asset. On the other hand, the company is early in proving revenue quality and will need to execute a meaningful land and expand motion, with limited current execution proof points, reflecting the build required in a Series A. At the same time, the investment has qualities of an incubation given the quantum of ownership, thesis driven nature of the bet, and the highly proprietary opportunity.

## Investment Thesis

1.  Drug development in rare disease is attractive because diseases are genetically driven, biological pathways are easier to discover and drug, and regulatory pathways are smoother and more open to experimentation (Orphan Drug Act, Rare Disease Act, IRA exemptions). As a result, biopharma invests ~$70B annually in US rare disease R&D, growing at a 12-15%+ CAGR. However, it is very difficult to run a trial in rare disease because the traditional CRO-driven prospective clinical study process does not serve this market well – diseases aren't well characterized, patients are hard to find, and KOLs are spread across institutions and specialist centers.

2.  Ciitizen's approach to use patient consent for retrospective clinical studies can significantly improve the research and development process in rare diseases, replacing significant portions of CRO-driven prospective work. This starts with characterizing the presentation and progression of a disease in natural history studies and, over time, should move to Ciitizen's data being used in clinical development (supplemental data, digital control arms), Ciitizen's patient relationships contributing to trial recruitment, and eventually Ciitizen powering HEOR / RWE use cases.
    *   Ciitizen has a high degree of product market fit in natural history studies. Ciitizen can deliver high quality data collection in months not years, lowering overall costs, time to market, and risk of asset failure in early research. Ciitizen has also shown that its data is useful in HEOR use cases, landing two $2M+ contracts for HEOR in rare cancer.
    *   Ciitizen's processes have been blessed by the FDA – Ciitizen is one of few, if not the only, RWE player to be cited as a sole source in an FDA submission. As a result, adoption curves are accelerating as novelty risk reduces – Flatiron had a similar acceleration after being cited as a joint-source in an FDA submission.
    *   Though control arm and recruitment use cases are unproven, they are logical extensions of work with Ciitizen's data. Customers have demonstrated interest in each and are actively working with Ciitizen to build regulatory comfort around digital control arms.

3.  The industry has structural advantages because of the nature of patient advocacy groups - each condition is winner-take-all and there are network effects. Patient advocacy groups are at the center of rare disease – they gate access to both patients and biopharma, constantly trade notes with each other, and work with effective exclusivity. Ciitizen has established 72 advocacy group partnerships (vs. 24 in 2021) and has sterling references. Each of those advocacy groups has no reason to replace Ciitizen (and would face an uphill battle with members to do so) and continuously spreads word of Ciitizen's value to other advocacy groups - the company is rapidly locking up "supply" in each disease area with added momentum as brand equity builds.

4.  Technology is critical to business success. Ciitizen's technological advantages are enabling them to plant a flag in dozens and dozens of conditions. Ciitizen uses process automation and ML/NLP to efficiently aggregate and extract data from medical records, including notes, labs, scans, and more. Aggregation and extraction costs have come down significantly over the past two years with a path to reducing another 50% in the near-term – Ciitizen's contract level contribution margins are ~65-80% today (vs. 10% at Picnic). As a result, significant capital can be redeployed in advocacy group and patient acquisition.

5.  Overall, we see a unique combination of a market in need of a solution + healthy moats and structural advantages + a core technology company, all of which should lead to an attractive long-run business model. Ciitizen has the potential to be a combination of a traditional data software business and a high margin CRO, where revenue is project-based but re-occurring by logo. Of course, Ciitizen's model today is transactional revenue and lower value capture, as the market is young.

6.  Ciitizen's executive team is excellent and highly mission driven. The team has significant depth across pharma business development, rare disease and advocacy groups, healthcare data regulation, AI, and has demonstrated an ability to build despite significant headwinds.
    *   Under Invitae's ownership, Ciitizen has only had six months of distraction free time to execute, from January 2022 to July 2022. Ciitizen has 1 FTE focused on GTM, no dedicated marketing support, no dedicated engineering support, and significant limitations on marketing channels.
    *   Despite Invitae driven headwinds, Ciitizen has accomplished a lot including citation as the sole source in an FDA submission, 135% bookings growth in 2022, 3x growth in advocacy group relationships, 2x average per patient price expansion, 75% reduction in data aggregation costs, and 25% reduction in data extraction costs, with refactored models to accelerate disease area expansion.

7.  Our entry price point and ownership are reflective of an early business with a combination of positive early dynamics and a lot to still prove. Should we be wrong about timing, we believe we have strong downside protection given the asset value of the data cohorts that have been and will be built, not to mention that the company was already acquired for $300M+ with significantly less accomplished (albeit at a different time in the market). There is a broad universe of buyers who would find Ciitizen highly strategic including CROs and data businesses with a focus on building differentiated datasets (Datavant, Truveta).

## What We Need to Believe

Ciitizen is the market leader for data services among patient advocacy groups. The company has 72 total advocacy relationships, increased those advocacy group relationships 3x in two years, and has demonstrated a strong value proposition per reference calls. The brand equity Ciitizen is building is translating to accelerating referrals between and validation among advocacy groups, capitalizing on a winner-take-all dynamic in the industry.

As a result, Ciitizen is beginning to build go to market momentum, solving a complicated top of funnel motion with biopharma – advocacy groups work closely with sponsors considering their condition and refer them to Ciitizen. Our bet is that Ciitizen's depth of relationships with patient advocacy groups can help them:

1.  More efficiently land with and build early relationships with biopharma companies to kick off initial NHS projects, as they have with Praxis, Mahzi, Zynerba, Xenon, Biogen, and Servier.
2.  With execution, expand to additional NHS projects at a faster pace, as they have with Mahzi and Zynerba, and eventually become the enterprise partner for all NHS, as they have with Praxis.
3.  Expand to new use cases as they build depth in disease areas and deeper relationships with biopharma customers. In early research, Ciitizen may build a recurring revenue business enabling target hunting, which is in pipeline with Biogen and under early consideration with UCB. In clinical development, Ciitizen is highly likely to expand to supplemental data and may build a high value capture business in recruitment, which is under early consideration with Praxis.
4.  As a result of each of the above, significantly change quality of revenue from project-based revenue to re-occurring and/or recurring revenue over time.
5.  Build a long-run network effect-based moat, since advocacy groups will focus on working with the market leader and partner on an effectively exclusive basis.

Our return is ultimately driven by how well Ciitizen executes on the land and expand story, meaning with how many customers and how quickly. Our expectation is that Ciitizen takes through 2024 to demonstrate execution on the opportunities they have today. As a result, they may have a moderate growth P&L for the next 1-2 years, hampered by a lack of top of funnel velocity. Then, as execution translates to expansion, we'd expect higher revenue quality and larger ACVs per logo, driving outsized growth and possibly multiple expansion. If Ciitizen is unable to execute or takes too long to do so, the expected P&L acceleration may not happen at all, or more likely, fully fall within our hold period for us to make a satisfactory return.

To earn a tail outcome (10x+), we also have to believe that Ciitizen can engage regulators to accept Ciitizen's retrospective data as the comparator arm to a clinical trial. As previously discussed, comparator arms have an order of magnitude higher value capture and make Ciitizen significantly more strategic. Ciitizen is in the early innings of working with regulators, in partnership with Praxis and others today. Other levers not discussed above but worth mentioning include price expansion – Ciitizen has expanded pricing from $2K per patient to $4K per patient since 2021 and customer calls have indicated willingness to pay of up to $8K in NHS – and data aggregation and extraction efficiency – Ciitizen has lowered costs for each by 75% and 25% since 2021 and has a near term roadmap to lower them an additional 50% each. Each would improve profitability but do little to improve exit multiple.

Throughout our memo, we will unpack each of the above points focusing on key questions raised during our initial committee discussion, namely the quality of Ciitizen's GTM motion and revenues, the strategic relevance of its products, potential for expansion and revenue quality improvement, and long run moat.

## Ciitizen Has a Complicated GTM Motion and Transactional Revenue

Ciitizen's GTM motion has top of funnel complexity, relative to traditional biopharma motions.

*(Visual Placeholder: Yellow circle, likely indicating complexity or a funnel)*

From a market perspective, many pre-clinical programs, especially in rare disease, are not publicly or widely known, meaning there are not high-quality databases that know Biopharma A is working on a program in Genetic Disease X. Nearly half of the programs Ciitizen is working on are not publicly disclosed. Additionally, Ciitizen's focus on natural history studies requires them to engage early in the pre-clinical process before biopharma commits resources to traditional CRO based approaches. When Ciitizen loses a deal, it is typically because the asset is too far along to explore a new approach to NHS.

If it weren't for patient advocacy groups, this level of complexity would make it nearly impossible to go to market in this segment. One of patient advocacy groups' main functions is to organize a community of patients and advocate on their behalf to biopharma companies to prioritize development in their condition. As a result, patient advocacy groups are in extensive contact with biopharma and have unique insights into early research priorities.

Ciitizen has spent the last two years accelerating its motion with advocacy groups, focusing on rare neurological conditions. Ciitizen proactively engages advocacy groups based on an internal view of which diseases are likely to be high priority development areas in the next 1-3 years. As Ciitizen works with those advocacy groups, they build additional insights into the pharma companies interested in developing in the condition and build ecosystem connectivity to refine their view of high value conditions. As that motion unfolds, Ciitizen is increasingly directed to sponsors by advocacy groups, helping fill top of funnel opportunities. AstraZeneca (HEOR), Zynerba (pipeline), Biogen, Boehringer-Ingelheim (pipeline), and partly Jazz (pipeline) were introduced to Ciitizen via advocacy groups.

The exhibit below visualizes this motion – it shows a sample of high priority genes in rare neurology (y-axis) and the number of biopharma companies interested in developing in the category (bars). The biopharma companies are then divided between those with a contract, in pipeline, and on the GTM roadmap. Each gene also notes whether Ciitizen has an advocacy group relationship and whether a cohort has been fully recruited. In less than one year of work in rare neurology, Ciitizen has landed 24 advocacy group relationships, recruited 15 full patient cohorts, contracted with 12 biopharma companies, and has another 24 in various stages of pipeline.

Each customer we spoke to indicated that they would and have recommended Ciitizen to peers at other biopharma companies, building additional top of funnel opportunities. Praxis, as an example, introduced Ionis (pipeline), UCB (pipeline), Neurogene (pipeline), and partly Jazz (pipeline) to Ciitizen.

Once in pipeline, Ciitizen has relatively fast sales cycles, ranging from 3-6 months for biotech and 6-12 months for large pharma, given a more extensive MSA negotiation process. This includes an evaluation period where Ciitizen will provide access to a sample of patient data to demonstrate the depth of information they have on the specific condition.

However, as previously discussed, Ciitizen has project-based revenue. Ciitizen prices a typical natural history study at ~$4K per patient and the full engagement may last 6-12 months depending on patient recruitment pace. If Ciitizen is only able to engage each customer for a single NHS, it would be fair to conclude that the revenue quality and value capture juice is not worth the top of funnel squeeze.

## Ciitizen's NHS Product is Strategic for Customers

Our customer calls suggest that Ciitizen's NHS product is highly strategic to biopharma customers.

In rare and ultrarare diseases, there is limited to no usable data for biopharma to understand the progression of a disease. To develop a drug in a rare condition, biopharma needs to conduct a natural history study, which is effectively a Phase 0, non-treatment clinical trial, which focuses on measuring how the disease presents and progresses over time. Both patients and their caregivers are reluctant to participate in these studies because they are burdensome (e.g., require traveling long distances with a child who has a rare disease) and are non-treatment, meaning patients do not directly benefit clinically. As a result, patients are difficult to recruit and come in and out of the study resulting in long timelines (two to five years), high costs ($20-30K per patient or $2-5M of total spend), and high failure risk.

Ciitizen, by contrast, offers a retrospective approach to natural history, using patient consent to collect historical medical records to show how a disease presents and progresses over time. In this approach, there is no patient burden beyond enrolling and consenting to record retrieval. As a result, data sets can be delivered in months, not years, with little to no completion risk at a fraction of the cost of a CRO run study ($4K per patient). As a result of these cost savings, customers have also indicated that they would continue to work with Ciitizen even if budgets were reduced by 10%, 15%, or 25% – Ciitizen is an ROI driver. Traditional NHS, by contrast, would have to be cut down because of the quantum of spend required to execute the study.

To take Praxis as an example, Praxis signed a contract with Ciitizen to recruit for two rare neurology conditions - SCN2A and SCN8A – because of Ciitizen's depth in neurology and relationship with the relevant patient advocacy groups. In May 2021, Ciitizen delivered an n=46 cohort for SCN2A and n=79 cohort for SCN8A. Ciitizen's data was used to confirm the primary endpoint for the Phase I/II study, determine the recruitment plan, refine biomarkers, and most importantly educate regulators on unmet need and disease burden to accelerate the Phase I/II clinical trial. In January 2022, Praxis filed its IND with the FDA for both genes and the submission was accepted in September 2022, saving 3-5 years of pre-clinical research.

It is important to note that there are drawbacks to a retrospective approach, specifically that there is a tradeoff in data “fit”. In retrospective data collection, biopharma cannot control the specific means and frequency of measuring the progression of a disease as they can in a prospective study – they are reliant on the standard of care. This creates a risk reward trade off where speed, cost, lower patient burden, and higher completion weigh against the need for standardized measurement. Ultimately, this is a condition specific decision based on how regulators may eventually consider the data. Customer calls indicate that while the FDA is early in building an understanding of Ciitizen specifically, general guidance suggests they will be more accepting of novel data, given a focus on reducing patient burden.

That said, biopharma may still work with Ciitizen as a supplement to the traditional NHS. Customers have indicated that there are several additional advantages to Ciitizen including a direct patient relationship that can help with recruitment and the ability to use historical records to refine and/or select new endpoints, refining the NHS protocol.

Customers also noted that Ciitizen's approach to data aggregation and extraction are significantly de-risked since their data has been used in an FDA submission. As a result, there is less concern about adopting a novel approach to NHS. Instead, the focus is on whether retrospective data generally is fit for purpose in the specific condition.

## Ciitizen's Initial NHS Engagements are "At Bats” for Larger Opportunities

Each customer and prospect we spoke to indicated that their initial work with Ciitizen is an "at bat" for a larger opportunity, but we have limited historical evidence of successful significant expansion.

*(Visual Placeholder: Yellow circle, likely indicating "at bats" or expansion opportunities)*

In Servier and Rocket's case, each is interested in partnering with Ciitizen as the first choice for natural history studies across their pre-clinical portfolio. In that scenario, they'd first evaluate Ciitizen's retrospective data and only if it isn't a fit, given the standard of care for the condition, will they consider prospective data collection. As Rocket put it, Ciitizen could be part of an "umbrella protocol" where they would work together across the full company for NHS, refreshes, and additional add ons over time.

This is the same structure Ciitizen has with Praxis today where Ciitizen is the de facto partner for all NHS work. Initially, the Praxis contract was a $4M opportunity to conduct NHS work across 18 disease areas. Of course, that contract was rescoped to $1.3M as Praxis performance issues led to a reduction in the overall number of programs the company would pursue.

In Biogen's case, they are interested in licensing a broad swath of Ciitizen's rare neurology database for "target hunting". In this arrangement, Biogen would use a “lite” pull of Ciitizen's data to build an initial view on how they may develop a drug in a variety of conditions. As Biogen then selects targets to chase, they would run a natural history study, creating efficient lead generation for Ciitizen's core NHS business. This subscription deal is in early pipeline, but has an estimated price of $2M, though Biogen has floated low eight figures. Other medium to large sized pharma with disease area focus could be interested in a similar subscription - UCB is in early stages of consideration.

Finally, each customer indicated that they are interested in relicensing Ciitizen's data as assets move from pre-clinical research to clinical development and beyond.

In clinical development, Ciitizen would likely start as a supplemental data source to a traditional single-arm control trial (similar pricing to NHS). Customers also indicated interest in working with Ciitizen for patient recruitment (~$30K per patient) and digital comparator arms ($10-20M per trial). Praxis has noted that it is highly likely that the data is relicensed as supplemental data in the Phase I/II combined trial and are in early discussions for patient recruitment services. The two companies are also co-presenting to the FDA in the coming months to begin the process for Ciitizen's data to be used as the comparator arm for the trial. Rocket is also interested in recruitment and comparator use cases and does not believe the FDA will have concern with Ciitizen's retrospective approach, if the frequency and means of end point measurement is appropriate for the condition.

In post-marketing, Ciitizen has an opportunity to address HEOR use cases and does so today in rare cancer. Ciitizen works with the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society and AstraZeneca for HEOR projects, each of which has a $2-2.5M total contract over a 1-2 year term. This business segment is economically compelling because (1) programs are known and advocacy groups can facilitate introductions, (2) pricing is similar to NHS with lower cost to service, and (3) revenue is re-occurring because of refresh requirements. For the medium term, Ciitizen will serve this use case for rare cancers and in the long term may serve this use case in rare disease more broadly, assuming assets progress to later stages of development.

Overall, the commentary from customers has been positive regarding the potential they see in Ciitizen. However, we have limited evidence of successful expansion given Praxis' contract was rescoped. Ultimately, this is the crux of the bet we're making.

## Ciitizen is Building a Network Effect Based Moat with Advocacy Groups

Calls with patient advocacy groups indicate that Ciitizen is building momentum, creating a referral dynamic and shutting competition out of the market.

*(Visual Placeholder: Green circle, likely indicating network effect or growth momentum)*

As previously mentioned, one of patient advocacy groups' main functions is to organize a community of patients and advocate on their behalf to biopharma companies to prioritize development in their condition. To do so, advocacy groups need to lower the burden for research in the condition through the creation of data. One of the first things patient advocacy groups are told when they form is to begin to build an NHS-esque data set. Of course, their ability to do so is constrained by funding, complexity, and patient burden. Ciitizen's ability to build a retrospective dataset, without cost to the advocacy group, creates significant value for the advocacy group – the condition becomes more attractive to prospective biopharma sponsors.

However, each patient advocacy group will only partner with a patient consented data player once. Asking patients and their families to consent to medical record aggregation with multiple vendors would create "chaos" – the advocacy group would look like it didn't do its diligence and members would be confused as to why they're being asked to do this twice, especially given the sensitive nature of the data. As a result, there is a winner take all dynamic by patient advocacy group and, by extension, condition.

When advocacy groups make the decision to partner with a patient consented data player, they typically engage their peers and more advanced advocacy groups for their perspective. All the advocacy groups we spoke to were aware of Allstripes and some evaluated them. Ultimately, the advocacy groups chose Ciitizen because other advocacy groups they respected worked with Ciitizen, and because of Nasha Fitter's credibility as a rare disease parent. To visualize this, in 2021 we spoke to SYNGAP1, who was brought on by Nasha. In current diligence, we spoke to KCNT1 and CACNA1A, each of whom were brought on by SYNGAP1 and has since recommended Ciitizen to others. Validation from Praxis and other pharma companies is also building buzz for Ciitizen in the advocacy group world.

Ciitizen has doubled down to lock up advocacy groups by proactively recruiting them to its Rare Patient Network, regardless of immediate monetization opportunity. This strategy compounds the organic referral dynamic between advocacy groups (they appreciate that Ciitizen is not prioritizing only the near-term monetizable diseases), drives additional top of funnel GTM activity, and sets Ciitizen up for success as proactively recruited conditions rise on biopharma's priority list. Biopharma's priority list is also highly influenced by the availability of data, especially Ciitizen's data.

Despite only two FTEs dedicated to advocacy group growth, Ciitizen has expanded its number of advocacy group partners from 24 in 2021 to 72 groups today. In neurology specifically, Ciitizen has more than doubled its advocacy group traction in the first 6 months of 2023, currently working with 24 groups. This growth is largely a product of Ciitizen's Rare Patient Network, which we expect to continue to invest in post-carve out. Other post-carve out initiatives to expand advocacy group traction include building an ecosystem of KOLs and deepening relationships with umbrella groups to create a network effect where "all roads lead to Ciitizen" across strategic rare disease areas. Upon onboarding additional advocacy groups, we expect Ciitizen to drive more effective cohort engagement and onboarding through growth marketing initiatives unlocked by the carve out, which are discussed in the following section.

## Ciitizen has Highly Efficient Unit Economics

Upon additional deep-dive discussions covering Ciitizen's unit economics, we remain excited about management's ability to continue to utilize technology to drive high unit economic efficiency across patient acquisition, data aggregation, and data extraction.

|                        | 2019-2021 | 2022    | 2023+   |
| :--------------------- | :-------- | :------ | :------ |
| Patient Acquisition    | --        | $566.00 | $321.00 |
| Data Aggregation (per request) | $20.00    | $4.72   | $2.05   |
| Data Extraction (per clinical entity) | $4.30     | $3.30   | $1.50   |

Ciitizen has seen variability in its patient acquisition costs. In 2022, costs jumped as Ciitizen invested to develop the Rare Patient Network initiative. Costs in 2023, have come down significantly to a more normalized ~$320 per record as the Rare Patient Network launched, which should drive further reduction as advocacy groups refer to each other and join en masse (RPN has doubled advocacy acquisition YTD). From here, Ciitizen has a large opportunity to amplify its patient acquisition capabilities through growth marketing and KOL channels. As previously discussed, Ciitizen acquires patients through patient advocacy groups for rare and ultrarare diseases. To do so, Ciitizen works with the advocacy group to set up a co-branded landing page and provides the advocacy group with collateral for outreach to members. Ciitizen does no additional work to amplify the message through SEO/SEM or KOL engagement because of Invitae's compliance restrictions. Post-transaction, there exists a meaningful opportunity to deploy KOL engagement and traditional growth marketing strategies to amplify the work Ciitizen is doing with advocacy groups and ecosystem partners. For clarity, Ciitizen does not plan on acquiring patients via social media ads (like Picnic), but instead, would like to help patient advocacy groups build omnichannel marketing strategies to push its message.

Ciitizen has also demonstrated scale in both its data aggregation and data extraction costs with room to drive additional efficiency in the near term.

Data aggregation costs have lowered from $20 / request in 2021 to $4.72 / request today. These cost reductions have primarily been achieved through process automation of record request submissions and record follow-ups. In the near-term, a path exists to decrease data aggregation costs by an additional +50% through standardization and automation of how data is requested and uploaded. The lowest hanging fruit in achieving these cost reductions is building an API to Ciox's data request portal, which would allow requests to be sent without requiring humans to upload records by hand. Ciitizen also expects to continue to automate record ingestion by encouraging the adoption of direct uploading by hospitals to Ciitizen's portal. Today, there remain many records that are ingested from hospitals via email, e-fax, copy services, or mail that can be automated. Between building an API to Ciox, implementing direct uploading with more hospitals, and other automation strategies, there exists an opportunity to reduce aggregation costs to ~$2.05 / request.

Data extraction costs have also meaningfully decreased over the last several years and have a path to additional improvement through LLMs. Management has reduced data extraction costs from $4.30 / data entry in 2021 to $3.30 / data entry today. Cost reductions have been driven by Ciitizen's common data framework, which is expected to decrease costs further to $1.50 / data entry in the near-term. As a reminder, Ciitizen's common data framework created a base model infrastructure for data extraction that is transferable across all diseases (versus previously building discrete ML models for each disease area). Resultingly, the common data framework reduces time required to launch a new disease area and enables modular data extraction – if a client only needs some of the data, Ciitizen no longer has to spend to extract all of the data. Management also expects LLMs to drive 2-4x cost efficiency across data extraction. LLMs provide a stronger common base framework than Ciitizen's current ML/NLP based common data model. As a result, time to train the model to appropriately identify, sectionize, and extract data in a disease area is cut significantly.

Despite a high degree of confidence that Ciitizen can meaningfully decrease data aggregation and extraction unit costs further, we do not give credit for these efficiencies in our model.

Ciitizen's cohorts have efficient unit economics across its NHS and RWE post-commercial segments. Within NHS, Ciitizen has a ~67% year-1 contribution margin inclusive of patient acquisition costs and data collection and extraction costs. If a patient can be re-monetized across other pre-clinical studies with different sponsors or in later stage trials, the contribution margin per patient increases to 85-88% per additional use case since the Company does not need to spend on patient acquisition and initial data requirement costs. Ciitizen benefits from a similar dynamic in its RWE post-commercial segment. In the first year of an RWE sale, Ciitizen has a ~78% year-1 contribution margin per patient, which expands to ~78-80% per patient for each instance the data is refreshed.

Ciitizen's efficient patient acquisition strategy, re-monetization strategy, and resulting high value capture compares well against competitors like Picnic. Ciitizen is able to operate with 80-90 total employees vs. Picnic's 150 at 2022 year end + several hundred data extractors in the Philippines. Ciitizen's year 1 contribution margins sit at +67% vs. Picnic's 10%, despite bearing additional costs like patient and advocacy group revenue sharing.

## Ciitizen's Team has Significant Subject Matter Depth

Our additional interactions with the Ciitizen team give us a high degree of confidence that they are strong operators, are mission driven, and possess deep experience across pharma business development, rare disease, healthcare data, and artificial intelligence to build a market leading business in the patient-consented data space.

Farid Vij (CEO) has a unique combination of vision and tactical execution. On each diligence call, he has been deep, even in functional areas that are outside of his business development background, like the nuances of Ciitizen's AI model. He has also retained a strong team around him with incredible depth in their respective functional areas. Nasha Fitter references extremely well with customers and advocacy groups, Elli Brimble has deep insights into healthcare informatics to inform how Ciitizen's AI can be optimized for each disease area, and Sarah Gesior has a similar depth in clinical operations to optimize record retrieval. Finally, Deven McGraw lends significant credibility given her extensive regulatory background in healthcare data privacy.

Of course, there are key gaps in the team given turnover under Invitae. Most importantly, the company needs to bring on a new CTO / Head of Engineering, specifically one who can capitalize on Ciitizen's 10M+ patient records to build unique, LLM based data extraction capabilities. Other near term hires include a COO, Head of Patient Community, and Head of People.

In the next phase of diligence, we will develop a better understanding of how complicated a separation this will be. Depending on learnings, we may consider engaging an external resource to process manage the separation of the two entities (i.e., forking code, AWS migration, new software licensing, back office resourcing, etc.).

## Market Size

Overall, there are approximately eleven thousand identified rare diseases, of which 85% are estimated to have a total patient population of less than two-thousand patients. Currently, there are an estimated 5.7 thousand pre-clinical onward programs, representing an NHS market opportunity of ~$2B. This market expands significantly as development and post-marketing use cases are layered in.

To provide a view of SAM we focus on the rare neurology NHS opportunity. There are approximately three thousand rare neurology conditions, of which Ciitizen estimates about 20% are medium-term serviceable based on Ciitizen's roadmap and current pharma pre-clinical programs. Assuming a consistent NHS ACV of ~$500K, there is a $300M serviceable market opportunity in rare neurology NHS alone. Based on Ciitizen's current fully recruited cohorts and pharma's current active pre-clinical programs, there is a ~$30M immediately addressable opportunity. There is another ~$15M that is near-term addressable based on cohorts Ciitizen has begun recruiting.

Based on customer calls, we believe it is highly likely that natural history study projects convert to supplemental data for clinical development. Pricing is likely the same as NHS, so each stage adds an additional $300M to the SAM. Of course, the likelihood of moving through the development funnel is increasingly low at each stage and there will be gaps in time between when one project ends and the next begins, typically 12 to 18 months. SAM expands more than 10x if Ciitizen successfully launches comparator arms.

Finally, as Ciitizen moves from rare neurology to rare cardiology (launched), rare neuromuscular (Q124), and other disease areas, SAM expands to include opportunities in each condition. Rare cancer opportunities in post-marketing RWE also expand SAM – Ciitizen serves this market today.

## Competition

Ciitizen does not have competitors in its market segment (rare diseases with patient populations of less than two thousand patients). When considering patient consented data more broadly, Ciitizen competes with Picnic and AllStripes.

Picnic's strategy focuses on larger prevalence disease areas and primarily acquires patients via social media and ad spend. Because Picnic focuses on widely prevalent diseases, it competes with other RWE vendors who leverage claims and EMR data. Resultingly, Picnic's data is primarily used as supplemental data and cannot replace CRO spend – Picnic competes for RWE budget, not CRO development budget. Also, because Picnic's patient acquisition strategy is social media based, Picnic is unable to build a mutually beneficial, engaging relationship with patients. As a result, Picnic sees patient dropout and generally low engagement, limiting their ability build a longitudinal patient record that can be re-monetized (per TCAP customer calls).

Although AllStripes does focus on rare and ultrarare diseases, the Company has struggled recently and is rumored to be pivoting the business. We have heard from customers that AllStripes has very limited technology, and as a result, has a very poor product and low data quality – "the data was not in a standard format and sat across 20-30 spreadsheets”.

Other RWE vendors include Optum, Truven, Truveta, Verana, OMNY, OM1, Corevitas, Concert AI, Tempus, Evidera, Syapse, and Flatiron. These players are not applicable competitors to Ciitizen because they primarily use claims and EMR data to provide RWE data and analytics in high prevalence disease areas. This approach is not applicable in rare and ultrarare diseases because diagnosis codes do not exist in these disease areas and there is not significant concentration of rare disease patients in EMRs.

## Other Key Risks

*   **Invitae Overhang:** Invitae has underinvested in and under-resourced Ciitizen, creating a drag on productivity and limiting Ciitizen's ability to execute. Ciitizen will need to reset internally to bring back a culture with start-up velocity. We believe operational issues like GTM resourcing and patient recruitment are less risky after spending more time with the team to understand limitations under Invitae.
*   **Transaction Distraction:** Ciitizen will lose momentum and possibly talent as Invitae and Ciitizen are separated. There will be a transition period that may create distraction for key management. We will aim to secure key talent before close and have structured employee equity to reflect a traditional Series A / B startup, with very attractive upside at current pricing. There is also uncertainty in how the two companies will be separated. On one hand, this should be simpler than a typical carveout since the company was acquired only two years ago and there has not been significant integration. On the other, we don't know what we don't know about how migration will work and may need to engage a 3rd party to assist management in the transition period post close.
*   **Expansion to New Disease Areas:** To build a large business, Ciitizen will have to expand to multiple rare disease areas. Ciitizen has already expanded from rare cancer to rare neurology and launched rare cardiology earlier this year. The previously described common data framework has also demonstrated that data extraction in new disease areas is more efficient than it has been historically.
*   **Biotech Winter:** Ciitizen is selling to biotech at a time where biotech has limited access to capital. On one hand, this may force biotech companies to innovate and explore innovative, cheaper approaches to research (i.e., Ciitizen's retrospective NHS approach). Customer calls have been very supportive of the ROI Ciitizen creates. On the other hand, biotech companies may still reduce the overall number of programs they go after, even if they keep working with Ciitizen, making enterprise-wide NHS expansion a smaller financial opportunity. This is exactly what unfolded with Praxis.

## Management Forecast

Prior to the Invitae acquisition, Ciitizen reached ~$4M of bookings in 2021 and continued to grow by +100% year-over-year to ~$9.4M of bookings in 2022 post-acquisition. Due to the limitations of sitting inside Invitae (primarily Invitae's substantial business struggles) and de-integration distraction in the back half of this year, Ciitizen expects growth to be roughly flat in 2023 year-over-year.

By 2025, management expects to reach ~$40M of bookings and launch its new uses cases across synthetic control arm, clinical trial recruitment, and drug discovery subscription. The Company's current products and services (NHS & post-commercial RWE) are expected to contribute most of bookings through 2024 with these new use cases going live in late 2024 and 2025.

As part of the spin out, Ciitizen plans on reducing headcount from 122 today to 79, ramping to ~90 by 2023 year-end. Headcount efficiency is largely driven by leverage available in data extraction operations, a more streamlined team given removal of red-tape, and fewer back-office personnel as a private company.

Management's key areas of investment will be LLM data extraction, development of synthetic control arm capabilities, and a patient community to further invest in the Rare Patient Network success. Resultingly, Management expects to burn ~$40-50M from H2 23 through to 2026 year-end, providing ~3.5 years of runway from this investment.

Note that COGS includes proactive recruitment of unmonetized patients. As a result, gross margins are represented as significantly lower than as shown in the unit economics section of this memo.

## Model and Returns

Transformation has prepared two model scenarios to illustrate two paths the business may take. However, given the early nature of revenue quality, we believe it is more important to consider a fan of qualitative outcomes.

**Downside Scenario:** Ciitizen continues to build datasets in rare neurology and rare cardiology but struggles to land with enough clients to kick off the land and expand motion needed to drive returns. As a result, the company does not build significant enough revenue to trade for its financial profile. Instead, the company trades for the asset value of its datasets. Based on prior experience, we are confident that novel healthcare datasets have significant value, driven by their scarcity and their strategic relevance – Ciitizen has built datasets that do not exist elsewhere in a significant category of interest for biopharma. Ciitizen has also already been purchased for $500M+ with significantly less traction, albeit at a very different time in the market. We return 1-1.5x on the investment.

**Base Scenario:** Ciitizen executes the land and expand motion, engaging biopharma for initial NHS work and expanding horizontally across programs and longitudinally as programs move through stages of development. As a result, Ciitizen is able to build significant value capture per logo in rare neurology to start, with expansion over time to rare cardiology and other disease areas. Ciitizen is then acquired in a strategic acquisition by a CRO, larger healthcare data companies, or biopharma directly at a moderate premium to traditional CROs. We return 3-5x on the investment, depending on how many logos Ciitizen can build significant value capture in.

**Upside Scenario:** Ciitizen executes the land and expand motion and unlocks significant value capture with biopharma in clinical development, likely through trial recruitment and digital comparator arms. Each use case unlocks 10x more value capture per engagement and transforms quality of revenue given multi-year highly strategic engagements. Ciitizen is then acquired in a strategic acquisition by a CRO, larger healthcare data company, or biopharma directly at a significant premium to traditional CROs. We return 7-10x+ on the investment.

### TCAP Base Case

Our base case forecasts Ciitizen will reach ~$100M of bookings and ~$16M of EBITDA (~20% margins) by 2030E. We assume revenue is contributed by only live or in-pipeline segments that Ciitizen recognizes today - Natural History Study, RWE Post-Commercial, and Drug Discovery Subscription (currently in-pipeline with Biogen). Levers to drive our upside case include selling into Clinical Trial Recruitment and Synthetic Control Arm use cases.

### Revenue Build

We categorize revenue in three buckets based on Ciitizen's contribution to the sequential stages of drug development:

1.  **Early Research Use Cases:** pre-clinical natural history study revenue and drug discovery subscription revenue
2.  **Phase 1+ Development:** natural history study cohorts re-monetized for phase 1, 2, and 3 trials; Our upside case includes synthetic control arm and clinical trial recruitment in this segment
3.  **Post Commercial:** real world evidence revenue

The TCAP base case forecasts Early Research Use Case bookings grow from ~$7.2M in 2022 to ~$67M by 2030. Growth in this segment is driven by a combination of new, pre-clinical natural history cohort sales, re-monetization of these cohorts to other sponsors, and drug discovery subscription revenue. We assume a steady ramp in new quarterly pre-clinical NHS sales from ~3 projects per quarter today to ~10 projects per quarter by 2030 – for context Ciitizen was initially partnered with Praxis to run NHS for 18 cohorts. To model re-monetized pre-clinical NHS revenue, we project 75% of cohorts are re-monetized one time, a year after initially sold (vs. Picnic's projected re-monetization rate of 5 additional sponsors). Drug discovery subscription revenue is expected to contribute ~$1M to this segment in 2024, ramping to ~$27M by 2030, despite the $2-10M opportunity in early pipeline with Biogen today. Scaling drug discovery subscription revenue is highly dependent on Ciitizen's ability to build density in disease areas as they have in rare neurology.

Phase 1+ Development revenue is also a product of new, pre-clinical NHS sales. We assume 75% of new, pre-clinical NHS cohorts are re-monetized at least once in clinical development conducted by the purchasing sponsor. We believe this is a conservative assumption given ~90% of IND applications progress to phase 1 trials. Our upside case also includes synthetic control arm and clinical trial recruitment revenue in this segment, although our base case does not.

Lastly, the Post-Commercial segment exclusively includes Ciitizen's RWE business. We assume a conservative ramp from ~1 quarterly customer add in 2023 to 10 quarterly customer adds by 2030 and a long-term churn rate of 30%, given the two-to-three-year life estimated with today's AstraZeneca contract.

Our forecast assumes Ciitizen can transition its current, project-based revenue to a re-occurring model over time by expanding NHS in each logo, re-monetizing NHS cohorts to additional sponsors, and by increasing cohort data usability in drug development. The deal team understands this transition requires a meaningful company build and successful customer adoption – if the company is unable to execute on this transition, we will likely return ~1-1.5x on our investment.

### Cost Build

We've conducted an in-depth review of COGS and other operating expenses to appropriately allocate costs across buckets. In our base case, we believe the transition to a re-occurring model and the re-monetization of pre-clinical NHS sales enables Ciitizen to expand gross margins from ~56% in 2022 to ~83% by 2030. As a result of gross margin expansion, we forecast the Company to have significant operating leverage to scale EBITDA margins to ~20% by 2030.

The primary components of COGS include patient acquisition, data collection, and data extraction. Our model assumes these costs largely remain constant with minimal improvements in efficiency over time – no credit to Ciitizen's cost improvement and automation initiatives. We assume the remaining operating expenses trend in-line with historic performance and benefit from operating leverage as the top-line scales over time.

### TCAP Upside Case

Our upside case forecasts Ciitizen will reach ~$165M of bookings and ~$52M of EBITDA (38% margins) by 2030E. The primary drivers of our upside case are the inclusion of clinical trial recruitment and synthetic control arm use cases – both of which are high value capture, high margin business lines. We maintained our 75% attach rate assumption between IND and Phase I but lowered overall value capture to account for a mix of supplemental and synthetic control arm use cases. We did not model re-monetization as trials move from Phase I to Phase II to Phase III, since approvals are increasingly narrow. Lastly, our clinical trial recruitment build assumes revenue begins in late 2024 with 1 customer add per quarter through the projection period. All other revenue and cost assumptions are consistent with our base case.

## Returns

At exit, we underwrite a 20.0x EBITDA multiple, assuming Ciitizen will demand a slight premium to CRO precedents (Appendix A) based on its ability to transition to a re-occurring revenue model and scale as a valuable data business. We increase our multiple to 25.0x in our upside case given the strategic importance of digital comparator arms. For reference, Flatiron traded for 10.5x LTM Revenue in 2018 – our implied revenue multiple at exit is ~4.1x in our base case and ~9.6x in our upside case. We also assume the Company incurs 15% dilution from an additional financing. We forecast a ~3.0x return in our base case and a ~10.0x return in our upside case. There are significant degrees of freedom between each case depending on how well Ciitizen executes (i.e., modelled deals sold, attach rates, value capture, churn, exit multiples may be significantly different driving variance in the base and upside case). We've aimed to be highly conservative given this has Series A qualities.

## Appendix D: Customer Reference Calls

### Biogen

#### Background

1.  Could you provide an overview of your background and your company's?
    a.  Neurologist and physiologist and professor at Stanford University
    b.  Joined Biogen to help measure impact of neurological treatment in early clinical development / clinical trial readiness
    c.  Initially met Ciitizen before it was acquired through a mutual connection
    d.  Decided to engage Ciitizen because Biogen was interested in learning more about a disease population in a gene that was discovered in 2012.
        i.  The gene had no effective methods of data capture previously
        ii. Biogen wanted to know how the disease is characterized and parse through three phenotypes
        iii. Patients could be identified by KOL, gene services, etc. but Biogen is interested in knowing how the patient progresses with the disease
2.  What pain point did you identify that prompted evaluation of services for NHS / RWE?
    a.  NHS studies can be run manually by academia or CROs, but what remains difficult because (1) it is not easy to engage patients effectively and (2) there is limited access to significant previous care visits and data
    b.  Ciitizen has found a way to engage the patient to get access to historical records in a way that's digestible
    c.  An NHS is basically a "phase 0" clinical trial without a treatment – this is the standard way of doing things where you pick sites, pick a CRO, and then measure patients without giving them a drug or treatment
    d.  This is very expensive (it is a clinical trial), it takes time (prospective), and patients may be reticent to participate because they don't get anything out of it other than altruism (it is not easy to participate – taking a disabled child on a long-distance trip to a site)
    e.  By contrast, submitting the medical record (Ciitizen) is way easier – this delta between feasibility to ease of participation is significant for the patient
    f.  From a regulatory standpoint, it remains to be seen how receptive the FDA is to a non-standardized measurement set based on historical clinical care

#### Ciitizen Performance

3.  How does Ciitizen compare vs. the status quo? Competitors?
    a.  Competitors may exist, but Biogen has not evaluated them comprehensively / know them very well
    b.  Optum, IQVIA and other traditional RWE vendors have done some data aggregation pitches but it may not be relevant with respect to Ciitizen's use cases
4.  Would you keep Ciitizen if the budget was cut by 10%? What about 15%, 25%?
    a.  Biogen is still budget sensitive as it is quite small compared to Merck and Pfizer (recently executed a RIF due to budget cuts)
    b.  The reason Biogen did the contract with Ciitizen was because they got a relatively good deal, bundling it with Invitae related work - Biogen would not have signed the Ciitizen contract
    c.  without the bundled component
    d.  Biogen views its current contract with Ciitizen as a test case – if Ciitizen performs well they may expand but will be price sensitive, especially if they end up having to do the traditional NHS anyways
    e.  Because Biotech budgets are compressed, there won't be a lot of prospective NHS – this makes Ciitizen look particularly attractive given the cost and time savings associated with a Ciitizen NHS replacement
    f.  Ciitizen's potential value capture sits between academia and a traditional CRO
5.  What are the cons of Ciitizen? When is Ciitizen not a good fit for you?
    a.  From a regulatory standpoint, it remains to be seen how receptive the FDA is to a non-standardized measurement set based on historical clinical care
    b.  Ultimately it's a risk / reward trade off where if the patient burden is high, the treatment space is wide open, then it is attractive to try and do this in a novel way with the best retrospective data vs. an expensive time consuming prospective NHS – this is an evolving discussion and the FDA is more risk forward on this point than others in Europe
    c.  Future concern is how they get international data and how that balances with DE&I – in a prospective NHS, Biogen could reach patients in other countries (Biogen wants to develop drugs applicable to all humans, not just Americans)
    d.  Ciitizen retrospective NHS studies are dramatically cheaper and faster than a prospective NHS

#### Ciitizen Expansion

6.  How many programs could you use Ciitizen for within your organization? What do they need to prove to become the primary NHS provider for your organization?
    a.  Biogen wants to see a picture of what it's like to live with a certain disease between the condition and the treatments experienced by the patients
    b.  Ciitizen's access to EEG trace files, not just the doctor's report – is what is particularly novel and important (MRI images are another example of a valuable datapoint / record)
    c.  Biogen has disease areas that they work on (not just diseases) so would be interested in using Ciitizen as a broad platform for early research
    i.   Breadth, not depth, is important here, especially if you're target hunting to pick diseases to go after; It is particularly useful to know the context of a disease (i.e. a survey level response)
7.  Do think that Ciitizen would be helpful in patient recruitment?
    a.  Parents and families who are providing Ciitizen with their child's private data are doing so with the hope that the data will contribute to a trial that the child can participate in

### Neurogene

#### Background

1.  Could you provide an overview of your background and your company's?
    a.  Lead business operating at Neurogene, a rare disease gene therapy company developing primarily orphan drugs
    b.  Spends most time in pre-commercialization activities (i.e., identifying patients suitable for an NHS or gene therapy study)
    c.  Initially found Ciitizen through a colleague who was spending time in genetic testing, who identified Invitae and Ciitizen
2.  What pain point did you identify that prompted evaluation of services for NHS / RWE?
    a.  Patient identification is really hard, especially in rare disease because patients are mis-diagnosed, see a variety of providers, etc.
    b.  Lots of data exists via advocacy groups, but the data is static and primarily reported by the patients' caregivers
    c.  The benefit of Ciitizen is their access to EHRs from a patient's history with providers (longitudinal data)
    i.   This is particularly interesting for biotechs who want to use the data for a synthetic control arm – it is often unethical to do a placebo trial for such a lethal, rare disease

#### Ciitizen Performance

3.  How does Ciitizen compare vs. the status quo? Competitors?
    a.  Status quo - the primary way that biotechs get data is through genetic tests, which physicians need or order a panel to get (this takes a really long time)
    b.  Other ways to identify patients for data capture are through advocacy groups, KOLs, and genetic testing companies
    c.  Ciitizen's primary competitors are patient consented data businesses (Picnic, AllStripes) and Genomic databases (Invitae, Saphetor, Varsome)
    d.  The key component to understand Ciitizen's value is whether they can provide the patients, their data, and whether that data could not be acquired via other channels
    e.  To do an NHS you have to look 5 years ahead to understand what the right endpoints are and whether they actually show the impact of a drug
    f.  Neurogene has done two other NHS studies, one run by the gov, one run by a patient organization -- they came to the same conclusion, but often there is incomplete information because the data used for those parties are not built -- Ciitizen data validates and complements the information that exists in those databases
    g.  The natural history of a disease is very difficult to capture, especially in rare / ultra-rare
4.  In what capacity are you working with Ciitizen today?
    a.  Neurogene is working with Ciitizen on an NHS to identity patients and understand how a certain disease progresses
    b.  Other companies have used Ciitizen to obtain an IND submission (i.e., Praxis), which shows that Ciitizen data has a lot of value – the Praxis case study validates the data quality and use cases
    c.  Other biotech's will be interested in Ciitizen data for NHS studies and external control arms because of the FDA's validation of the data in the Praxis IND submission
5.  What does success look like and what does failure look like with Ciitizen?
    a.  Neurogene is currently in a pilot phase with Ciitizen right now and have yet to receive ROI-related information
    b.  Ciitizen is not inexpensive, but it is valuable to do a pilot to see what a snapshot of patients look like and then they can access whether to go broader without spending as much money
    c.  If you don't use the data in place of a placebo, it can still help you design a better clinical trial since it gives you real insight into how the disease works
    d.  Neurogene already did a pre-pilot and they have what we're looking for – Neurogene just needs to figure out what they want to ask them; Ciitizen has really robust data
    e.  ROI all comes down to what data you have in your other channels and if there isn't enough info on certain patients, then you need to use Ciitizen to acquire more, high quality data
6.  Would you keep Ciitizen if the budget was cut by 10%? What about 15%, 25%?
    a.  Ciitizen prices based on what types of data is being requested
    b.  If Ciitizen did not have the data for a specific use case, Neurogene would not use it – if there is value in a pilot, then they would continue to use Ciitizen to answer questions requiring longitudinal data that is not available elsewhere
    c.  Neurogene will run an evaluation in each disease to see what data is already available in the database and therefore how valuable Ciitizen data is for them
    d.  If the data looks good in the pilot and then the budgets were cut, they would still use Ciitizen (though this is a group wide decision -- clinical development, medical, etc. would have to opine)
    e.  If the Ciitizen data helps answer an important question, Neurogene will pay for it
    i.   Proactive recruitment is critical for the pilot evaluation phase – Neurogene does not want to take recruitment risk unless you're far out from when the IND submission is or when the clinical study may happen

#### Ciitizen Expansion

7.  How many programs could you use Ciitizen for within your organization? What do they need to prove to become the primary NHS provider for your organization?
    a.  Neurogene has not explored this yet but would definitely relicense the data for Phase I trial if it is unique enough versus what is already available (if it was valuable at NHS, then it is valuable for Phase 1 but would likely want to add granularity)
    b.  Ciitizen would not be the sole data source for a comparator arm, but would exist alongside other data sources (govt., advocacy group, KOLs)
    i.   The FDA requires strict data elements and need information like patient reported outcomes – Neurogene has not thought of Ciitizen through a PRO lens primarily because the disease they are evaluating is easier to recruit
    c.  The ethical implications of giving a rare disease patient a placebo increases the likelihood of Ciitizen data usage across biotech's

### Servier

#### Background

1.  Could you provide an overview of your background and your company's?
    a.  Servier - mid-sized biotech based out of France with a global presence
    b.  Team who evaluated Ciitizen has done so in a neurological development capacity
    c.  Servier is currently using Ciitizen for one specific project because the data they have collected is very valuable - in rare and ultra rare disease, access to data is critical
    d.  Patient data is extremely important to design the development plan and study, and in non-rare disease, cohort data is easy to access
    e.  Servier is early in the process with Ciitizen to analyze a subset of the data they initially provided
2.  What pain point did you identify that prompted evaluation of services for NHS / RWE?
    a.  Interest in Ciitizen was generated by the hope that Ciitizen would allow Servier to avoid running a standard NHS; Servier would normally work with a registry in the absence of Ciitizen
    i.   Running an NHS requires designing and submitting a study plan (6-12 months), recruiting patients (12 months) and running the study (12 months)
    b.  If there isn't a registry with sufficient data, would need run a NHS, which is time consuming and expensive (as outlined above)
    c.  The more rare the disease is, the more important Ciitizen's data is because it is harder to collect data in rare indications

#### Ciitizen Performance

3.  How does Ciitizen compare vs. the status quo? Competitors?
    a.  From what they've evaluated so far, Servier believes Ciitizen has a comprehensive set of data to get information on the right type of patients, symptoms, and build a study based on it
    b.  Servier did not spend much time evaluating competitors because it was recommended by the patient advocacy group Servier was previously working with
    c.  Resultingly, Servier does not have a view on the competitive landscape / differentiation; however, compared to the data you can get from academic research sources, it is valuable
4.  Would you keep Ciitizen if the budget was cut by 10%? What about 15%, 25%?
    a.  Nobody can develop a treatment without NHS data, and traditional means of running an NHS are more expensive and time consuming than Ciitizen
    b.  So, Ciitizen is actually a budget saver, and Servier would continue its use of Ciitizen even if budgets contracted
    c.  If budgets were cut (threat of biotech winter), it would be more expensive to run a traditional NHS anyways, so the use of Ciitizen becomes more appealing
    d.  It is impossible to have any FDA interactions without data
5.  What are the cons of Ciitizen? When is Ciitizen not a good fit for you?
    a.  Early evaluation of Ciitizen data suggests it captures high quality of patients for the desired cohort and a high quality, comprehensive set of data per patient
    b.  Ciitizen's ability to pull data directly from the EMR is very important because it is hard to capture this data (versus only patient reported data)
    c.  The issue with Ciitizen is the fact that the data will not always be exactly what they would have run for an NHS in the past – They know the data won't be as perfect as a prospective NHS study, but it saves 2+ years of time which is very important to drug developers and patients

#### Ciitizen Expansion

6.  How many programs could you use Ciitizen for within your organization? What do they need to prove to become the primary NHS provider for your organization?
    a.  Yes - there will be programs that require data that comes via Ciitizen
    b.  To get there, Servier needs to get through this evaluation + execute on this project now with Ciitizen data
    c.  If it goes well, then yes, there is a further contract for expansion
    d.  It does have to match – the data set must meet what the project is looking at (1-2 of them at Servier may be a good fit)
7.  As individual assets move through stages of development, would you re-purchase Ciitizen data for a clinical trial as a supplemental source? How much would you pay for that?
    a.  The more data Servier can collect, the better
    b.  Ciitizen data remains valuable beyond IND submission into clinical trials
    c.  If this initial goes well, Servier would use the data again
    d.  If the drug shows effect, we will want more data on more patients
8.  Would you recommend this to peers at other biopharma companies with similar rare disease focus? How likely do you think they would be to adopt?
    a.  We would recommend that peers work with Ciitizen
    b.  The team is active, professional, and we got access to the data we were looking for

### Rocket Pharma

#### Background

1.  Could you provide an overview of your background and your company's?
    a.  Previously led RWE at NVS for solid tumor franchise
    b.  Currently leads RWE at Rocket with focus on supporting clinical programs (focus on gene therapy programs across Hematology and Cardiology)
    c.  Has known Farid and Ciitizen for +5 years; Have not worked with Ciitizen historically but have wanted to work with them for that time (unable to ink an agreement)
2.  What pain point did you identify that prompted evaluation of services for NHS / RWE?
    a.  Data is a necessity for all single arm trials in order to submit FDA (and other regulatory) submissions
    b.  The historical status quo is working with single academic centers to capture data from 10-12 patients, which is low quality data and not sufficient for a regulatory submission
    c.  There are typically three options to improve on the status quo
    i.   Run the same thing across more patients / more institutions – the problem with doing this is the data quality will still be low and there will be a low likelihood of regulatory success
    ii. Run a traditional NHS and work with 5-15 sites and a CRO to do a prospective study - the problem is these costs millions of dollars (currently doing this with one pre-clinical asset today because of limited willingness to accept change – this process is costing Rocket $5M + 3 years with some extra scope of work)
    1.  Because of the price (and time requirement) Rocket can't do 5-6 of these processes, and therefore, need a partner that can generate it at lower cost
    iii. Would like to work with Ciitizen to see what level of data they can collect (pilot) and then move to a larger partnership from there -
    iv. To evaluate Ciitizen, Rocket would like to get 10 patients on another program, gather the data, evaluate the quality, and then decide to invest further to build a larger partnership where there is a continuous pipeline of information (validation, investor meetings, regulatory, etc.)
    v. Long term goals and use cases with Ciitizen include (although still building the business case internally):
        1.  Aim to move towards an external comparator arm
        2.  Bringing along HEOR colleagues to show impact to market access down the line

#### Ciitizen Performance

3.  How does Ciitizen compare vs. the status quo? Competitors?
    a.  Colleagues have worked with Picnic and Allstripes in the past
    i.   Picnic health – could do the work, but they are less focused on rare disease
    ii. Allstripes – previously worked with them at NVS in rare disease, felt they were an immature company with data that was not high enough quality for a regulatory submission
    b.  The most important feature of Ciitizen is that the data/results are traceable (because they digitally aggregate medical records) where you can go all the way back to the source of the record
    c.  Data quality evaluation is focused on end point measurement, recruitment ability, but the go/no decision is dependent on whether Ciitizen can capture data form a specific disease state in an effective way (i.e., could you use a retrospective study to collect the required data)
4.  How do you expect to measure the impact Ciitizen has on the organization?
    a.  Assume Ciitizen data would cost $2M vs. status quo ($5M) with confidence that the data will be high enough quality
    b.  Ciitizen may be somewhat quicker than a traditional NHS depending on their ability to recruit patients – if it takes 1 year to recruit and 6 months to develop the study, you are still saving 1.5 years versus the status quo, which is very meaningful
    c.  Ciitizen could unlock the ability to do more NHS because of the money and time you are saving by not spending on a CRO (could do 5-6 at a time)
    d.  You also do not need to build a clinical operations team if using Ciitizen
5.  Would you keep Ciitizen if the budget was cut by 10? What about 15%, 25%?
    a.  If they had a smaller budget they would still take the novel approach (Ciitizen) that may be more efficient and costly
    b.  Budget cuts would encourage biotechs to get more creative on ways to cut the traditional means of doing this
    c.  The NHS savings could get repurposed for other early research
6.  What are the cons of Ciitizen? When is Ciitizen not a good fit for you?
    a.  Ciitizen may not be a good fit if the standard of care (what is captured in the medical record) does not include critical endpoint measurement
    b.  For a prospective study, you wouldn't want to work with Ciitizen because you need sites, monitoring, etc.
    i.   Ciitizen would complement but not replace a CRO in a prospective study
    c.  50% of Rocket's work would be a good fit for Ciitizen because it would be difficult to run a retrospective study if the standard of care does not include measurement of key endpoints (for example, a patient does not get an EKG once per month because of insurance restrictions, but would during a prospective study)
    i.   That said, if Ciitizen can help with patient recruitment especially through gene diagnostics, then there is value
    d.  Have not worked with Farid in the past because he is not a “risk taker" and neither were his bosses, because they did the site based NHS for 20 years
    i.   Senior decision makers are worried if you don't get the NHS right (and fail because you took a risk on a novel approach), the probability of success can go down significantly
    ii. The Praxis announcement helps but ultimately, the data collection has to fit the asset
    iii. The Praxis announcement does give confident that the process is appropriate

#### Ciitizen Expansion

7.  How many programs could you use Ciitizen for within your organization? What do they need to prove to become the primary NHS provider for your organization?
    a.  If there is one successful use case, then Rocket will likely make them part of a standard process
    b.  Rocket will consider them for an umbrella protocol to work with them across the full company to refresh / add on data and access longitudinal patient data across use cases
8.  As individual assets move through stages of development, would you re-purchase Ciitizen data for a clinical trial as a supplemental source? How much would you pay for that?
    a.  If Rocket had a larger relationship with Ciitizen they could see them using Ciitizen to support very early research
    b.  Once the IND is approved and they go to clinic, Rocket may consider using Ciitizen to build out a 30-40 patient study to use for a comparator arm
    c.  Rocket does not think the FDA is against the Ciitizen model for data collection in this context, and will want to see data that supports end point measurement
    i.   On a go-forward basis, Rocket would refresh those 30-40 patients for a while into post-marketing
9.  Would you recommend this to peers at other biopharma companies with similar rare disease focus? How likely do you think they would be to adopt?
    a.  We have referred them to others peers/competitors in the past and would be happy to do so again

## Appendix E: Patient Advocacy Group Reference Calls

### CACNA1A

#### Background

1.  Could you provide an overview of your background and your foundation's?
    a.  Was an attorney in PE deals practice but daughter had CACNA1A mutation
    b.  Stepped back to serve this foundation full time as a volunteer
    c.  The disease is heterogeneous in its presentation as a neurological disorder
    d.  Organization started in 2020 and had trouble matching genotype / phenotype, and were told that the first thing they needed to do was run an NHS or gather data on the condition
    e.  Partnered with Dr. Chung to get data from her clinic on PRO but realized they also needed clinician data - really difficult to get, especially at the height of COVID
    f.  The rare community is very collaborative and talks a lot - heard from other advocacy groups / leaders that tackled / thought about this problem (Nasha, Mike at Syngap 1) and heard about what Ciitizen was doing
    g.  At the time, Ciitizen had a charge (which eventually went away) and they started the rare patient network to help onboard quickly
    i.   It was a no brainer to join – there is so much data that's in the medical record for each family that is critical to have access to understand the progression of a disease and resultingly the impact a treatment may have
    ii. Ciitizen does all this for us – we're a small grassroots foundation with $500K of budget so having access to this is critical to feed the data back to their researchers and to see if pharma is interested to build an asset in this segment – makes us more attractive
    iii. There is resultingly huge buzz around this in the community – the value prop is huge
    iv. Seeing the Praxis study announce alongside the RPN, was really exciting because it makes this data type that much more interesting to pharma
2.  How does your foundation typically work with patient data in the context of pharma research?
    a.  CACNA1A is one of the larger, more common rare diseases (very large gene) – incidence of 1 in 12K
    b.  Huge commercial market for a drug developer vs. a 20-100 patient market
    c.  Have tried to reach out to different biotech companies to help highlight this area
    d.  Pitching the value prop of this foundation as a means of lowering the burden for developing in this area
    e.  Pharma wants to understand how “druggable" certain conditions are so they will reach out to learn more and understand what data is out there, what animal models exist, etc. - evaluating this vs. other neurodevelopmental disorders to see what to prioritize
3.  What vendors did you consider?
    a.  Didn't do a deep dive on other platforms
    b.  Focus was on the NHS they ran directly using patient reported outcomes w/ Dr. Wendy Chung - all eggs were in this basket
    c.  Looked at Ciitizen because others in the space that she looked up to (Nasha, Mike) recommended it
4.  Would you ever switch vendors or consider bringing patients onto another platform in addition to Ciitizen?
    a.  No - It does not make sense to do it a second time - there is a burden on families to ask them to enroll in more stuff
    b.  Need to be careful about what to ask your family for, especially something as sensitive as medical records, would burn trust

#### Market and Product

5.  Who is a good / bad fit for Ciitizen's rare patient network?
    a.  The RPN right now is limited to a certain seizure burden / developmental delay
    b.  Some won't fit that category naturally given focus on neurodevelopmental conditions
    c.  Don't see why an advocacy group wouldn't be a good fit for them – even if you're really small this is really easy to do and enroll
    d.  Even if you're large, this has efficiency on extraction of data
    e.  Have never heard from biotech or KOLs that there are any data quality issues

#### Sales and Execution

6.  Could you walk us through the process of working with Ciitizen? How do they get started, engage your members, deliver value to you etc.?
    a.  Ciitizen helped with marketing collateral, enrollment (including some inquiry work for families), etc.
    b.  Really responsive, weekly calls to handle aggregation, gives a forum for the advocacy group members to share views and ideas
7.  Would you recommend Ciitizen to the leaders of other foundations? How connected are different foundations to each other?
    a.  No hesitation in my mind on referring Ciitizen to others – no risk at all to doing it, Praxis helps a lot for validation, it is a brand name people recognize
    b.  Believe in Nasha as a leader given her background and credibility

### KCNT

#### Background

1.  Could you provide an overview of your background and your foundation's?
    a.  Plastic surgeon by background with a son that has the KCNT1 mutation
    b.  Focused on building drug discovery programs (started at 2 programs and now at 17)
    c.  Use Ciitizen and other means of driving discovery
    d.  The most important thing for advocacy groups to do is create an ecosystem where pharma is interested in the group (because of the data)
2.  How does your foundation typically work with patient data in the context of pharma research?
    a.  Pharma wants a well organized group that has access to patients that they can easily get in touch with
    i.   Everything the group does is centered around that – Ciitizen, NHS, patient engagement, etc.
    b.  KCNT is a simple monogenetic disease that makes it more attractive to pharma and biotech
    c.  You have to have data – we have 50% of the known patients with KCNT and interact with them regularly and then have data between Ciitizen, registry, NHS, etc.
    d.  Traditional NHS is a multi-year process that has a high patient burden -- Ciitizen does it in a very passive way
3.  How have you progressed from working on 2 drug discovery programs to 17?
    a.  The MD on his name helps add validity to the advocacy group from biotech's perspective
    b.  Big outreach of cold emailing anyone who would be interested in doing research in this category - all of this really started on cold emails
    c.  Then it's saying we have a registry (proves that you can organize), substantial proportion of the population, and then saying that we have a digital NHS with Ciitizen
    i.   The last point gets a lot of interest because it gives a sandbox of data that pharma and biotech can go play with
    ii. Ciitizen also gives insights into the endpoints to measure and modulate which is really interesting to pharma
4.  What prompted you to consider alternatives to the status quo?
    a.  The functional consideration was cost – a traditional NHS that we pay for is really expensive
    b.  The goal to build a data set that is basically a farm and use it as a way to get people to want to grow on that soil – some may fail, but some may do well
    c.  This gets you data ASAP that then is immediately usable for the farm vs. waiting for a prospective NHS
    d.  And this gets you more data points vs. just the endpoints selected
5.  What vendors did you consider?
    a.  Looked at Allstripes in addition to Ciitizen
    b.  The rare disease community gets to know each other and take references from each other
    i.   Someone he respected was more focused on Ciitizen
    ii. The CEO of Praxis was very pro Ciitizen
    iii. As a result, went with Ciitizen vs. a deep evaluation of Allstripes + Ciitizen
    c.  Don't know of anyone who had a better experience elsewhere
    i.   Ciitizen has delivered on everything they expected
    ii. Have 3 pharma teams paying for access to the data – Ciitizen has been impactful in adding and maintaining pharma relationships
6.  How did you identify them and how did you hear about Ciitizen?
    a.  There was no cost for Ciitizen and pharma was so interested in it that they basically paid for it - the folks at Praxis pushed this to the advocacy groups because they think it will supplement the traditional NHS approach
    b.  Also got to know Nasha for several years and was highly impressed with her
    c.  KCNT was in the first 10 groups to join Ciitizen

#### Market and Product

7.  Is Ciitizen a better fit for some foundations than for others? What needs to be true for the relationship to be successful?
    a.  If a new group came to him, Ciitizen or something like it is a critical piece of being an advocacy group - you have to get data from the members and Ciitizen is a super easy way to do it
    b.  It takes virtually no effort on the part of the foundation to onboard
    c.  For patients, part of the value is accelerating research, for others it's the money – especially because the patients have single parents
8.  Would you consider working with other patient-consented medical record aggregators?
    a.  No - Don't want to put multiple companies in front of parents
    b.  Migrating patients to other platforms creates chaos and erodes trust
    c.  Slim to none chance of moving unless Ciitizen was going out of business
    d.  The only thing is if someone said I can do the same thing and do it X times faster where X is way faster and the cost was way lower, then they would consider switching

### LGS

#### Background

1.  Could you provide an overview of your background and your foundation's?
    a.  Have worked in labs and in genetics generally in career
    b.  Mother of a daughter with LGS – this is a condition that builds on top of other neurological conditions
2.  How does your foundation typically work with patient data in the context of pharma research?
    a.  In LGS, there are 7 FDA approved drugs that don't really work
    b.  LGS is a condition that sits on top of other conditions; the drugs don't help the majority and people don't stay seizure free
    c.  People currently think about treating initial issues (prior to LGS) so LGS doesn't happen in the first place – the advocacy group wants to create an intervention pathway to stop this at various stages
    d.  Ciitizen can help discover more CACNA1A, SYNGAP, FOXG1, Down Syndrome, etc. – that helps build earlier prevention
    e.  LGS is limited in the effect it can have due to funding constraints
    f.  LGS works with 15 pharma companies and each asks what it's like to live with this, how symptoms present, and what would add value for treatment – the LGS foundation has to inform this and now there is the data to answer these key questions
3.  What vendors did you consider?
    a.  Evaluated government and other means of registries
    b.  Start ups like backpack health
4.  How did you identify them and how did you hear about Ciitizen?
    a.  Grant from the CZI foundation to accelerate the LGS work
    b.  Heard of Ciitizen through CZI because they met Nasha

#### Market and Product

5.  What value proposition does Ciitizen offer and how does it compare to the status quo and other vendors you considered? What is the value prop Ciitizen offers your members?
    a.  Went with Ciitizen last year because they make it very easy for parents and families to sign up (15 minutes)
    b.  Families need access to the medical record and Ciitizen makes easy to do so - wanted to market to families that having medical record access is important
    c.  Ciitizen builds a timeline of diagnoses, which is especially important because this disease builds on top of others – this helps give access to other help (gene therapy, DME, etc.)
    d.  LGS appreciated that they shared compensation back with the patients, which is very important because of their contribution to science
    e.  Having fully adjudicated records is unprecedented – expect that to be able to find many more intervention windows (vs. academia would do this in 3-5 years vs. Ciitizen can get a directional answer way faster)
    f.  Versus Backpack or other startups – this is patient driven (leadership and their understanding of how rare works, especially Nasha), high level of transparency, nonprofits were saturated and not doing much for the patients (to get the data back to them)
6.  How will you measure the impact Ciitizen has had on your foundation?
    a.  Launched in April – 75 patients on and expect to get to 250, which is really good for the society (7K members – families will come in as they're able given the family is in crisis mode)

## Appendix G: Expert Network Call Notes (2023)

### UCB Head of RWE Early Solutions, Global Real World Evidence and Digital Sciences

#### Evolution of RWE

*   RWE refers to data collected everywhere except for a randomized clinical trial
*   RWE has expanded from commercial use cases to the full drug development cycle today
    *   RWE was originally used for safety & efficacy and payor use cases (i.e., showing impact to outcomes & cost for reimbursement)
    *   RWE has since expanded to clinical development where it is used for use cases including trial feasibility and design, end point validation and measurement, synthetic control arms, recruitment, and more
    *   RWE is increasingly being used in research for target selection and identification and to understand the natural history of a disease
    *   Acceptance of RWE in regulatory submissions is early and is dependent on the quality of the data for the type of submission

#### RWE Market & Categories

*   Claims databases (Optum, Truven) have been on the market for 20 years to address safety & efficacy and payor use cases – data is collected only on claims submissions with clear coding
*   In more complicated diseases (i.e., neurology, autoimmune) codes are less clear and end point measurement is harder, requiring a shift to disease registries and medical records at health systems (Flatiron, Verana, OM1, OMNY)
*   In rare and ultra rare diseases, there are no diagnosis codes or data infrastructure in general, requiring novel approaches like patient consented data (Picnic, Allstripes, Ciitizen)
    *   This is the ultimate view into how a disease progresses because it captures a relatively large sample size of patients' full records
    *   There is no other data source in this category unless a sponsor hires a CRO to find and recruit patients for a natural history study or to answer specific research questions – this approach has lower data quality, is more expensive, and takes significantly longer
        *   "I will only use the CRO option if the patient consented players turn down the business, usually because it may be outside the US"
*   Patient consented data can also be used in the "complicated" disease areas over time as well (vs. just rare / ultra rare) if the drug has a "precision" component to it and requires novel data
    *   If patient consented data is simplified to be applicable to broader conditions, that would be a massive accelerant to precision medicine

#### Patient Consented Data Pricing & Budget

*   In ultrarare / rare disease, patient consented data is used over the full lifecycle of a drug – internal discussions (target selection, committee reviews, protocol design), Phase I / IND submissions (natural history study), Phase II / III trials (comparator, synthetic control arm), commercialization (market access), and post-commercialization regulatory follow ups (5-7 years of ongoing monitoring)
*   In aggregate, a sponsor would spend tens of millions on a patient cohort dataset over the course of the lifecycle
*   Of course, drugs fail at different points in the lifecycle and so the spend will be somewhat project based and spread out $1-2M at a time, though exact pricing will vary by target and other factors (rare vs. ultrarare, retrospective vs. prospective data, recruitment fees, etc.)
*   The CRO NHS alternative costs $5-15M, with worse quality, higher cost, and longer timeframes

#### Patient Consented Data Market

*   Overall, these companies are non-overlapping because they are focused on different segments of diseases, today at least
*   The key factors that matter between players are:
    *   Data quality
    *   Data refreshability
    *   Experience working with regulators
*   Invitae / Ciitizen -- market leader in this category based on tech, data quality, and regulatory validation
    *   Highest quality data and the FDA submission done with Praxis is a BIG deal
        *   Shows that their data is high quality
        *   Evidence that Ciitizen could recruit patients, extract the data, measure the endpoints, etc. all at a high enough quality for the FDA
        *   If Ciitizen's data is used in the Phase II / III combined trial as a comparator that would be a massive advancement in the industry
    *   The genetic data they get from Invitae is an advantage in rare and ultrarare disease and, relatedly, gene therapies
    *   Their relationships with the patient advocacy groups are important -- the patient advocacy group is important to ongoing access to the patient
    *   Worked with Ciitizen at a previous employer and again at UCB
    *   The team is excellent -- good people and very honest about what they can / cannot do
    *   Love that they do not let the sponsor have exclusive use of the data & shares it back with the advocacy group -- it's good for the full ecosystem in really tough diseases
*   Picnic
    *   Will work with the sponsor paying them to recruit to customize the data they collect / focus on
    *   Mixed data quality
        *   Does not have an ongoing relationship with the patient because they focus on disease areas without "community" and don't have a relationship with the patient advocacy group
        *   The data quality is initially good, but as time passes, there are increasing gaps that can't be filled
    *   Strong team and they are good people
*   Allstripes
    *   Less mature as a business -- still figuring out how to pull cohorts and improve data quality

### Novartis Executive Director, Global RWE Head - Applied and Advanced Analytics

#### Evolution of RWE

*   RWE was traditionally used for market access use cases, typically a nice to have to support publications to seek reimbursement or expanded use cases
*   In recent years, RWE has expanded across the pharma organization and in its level of importance
    *   Payors now require RWE submissions to receive reimbursement, expansion, or preferred treatment status
    *   In R&D, RWE has several applications including trial optimization, patient identification, integrated evidence and more
        *   RWE can be used to identify the patient population in situations where diagnosis codes don't exist like rare and ultrarare diseases, which in turn informs site selection, HCP engagement, and more
        *   RWE can be used as a form of integrated evidence to support submissions and to fill in gaps in trial data with a lens towards prospective data collection (key area for patient consented players)
        *   There is an early shift to novel uses of RWE like single control arms, measurement of disease progression, etc. especially in areas where there is limited available data or ability to collect data in an RCT
            *   Rare and ultrarare disease are most likely to take this approach, using patient consented data
            *   Oncology could do the same, though data cleanup is more difficult because it requires clinical context and interpretation
*   Regulatory bodies are becoming more accepting of RWE in submissions, though it is early stages for widespread usage
    *   FDA has published guidance that data needs to be fit for purpose and of the highest quality -- does not have metrics to measure each criteria
    *   Pharma would like to use richer data but typical sources of EMR and claims data lack depth and capture a fragment of the interactions a patient may have with the healthcare system -- data linking is increasingly a focus
    *   There are a few recent approvals where RWE was important to the submission -- the FDA is willing to accept and rely on RWE data but it is not yet widespread

#### RWE Market & Categories

*   Pharma does not yet have a consolidated view of the vendor landscape -- there are active initiatives to either centralize data strategy or to at least have a centralized catalog of vendors to select from for a study
*   There is a broader ecosystem of players to link, integrate, structure, analyze, etc. data
*   Patient consented data is great for rare diseases and oncology where it is difficult to determine a patient population (no codes) and the patient population is small / dispersed -- these are "unmet needs" areas
    *   Pharma is increasingly focused on "unmet needs" diseases because there is greenfield opportunity to build a blockbuster drug -- these areas are naturally complicated and is typically a rare / ultrarare condition or cancer
    *   Used patient consented data in a rare disease that had difficulty identifying a patient population because it had to be determined based on specific vitals, labs, and other information (it had an unclear diagnosis)
    *   Patient consented data can get 270 degrees of information on a patient because it brings together multiple data types and data sources to build a specific profile on a patient -- it is significantly richer than other approaches

#### Patient Consented Data Pricing & Budget

*   Budget is determined based on a number of situational factors including level of competition, the expected ROI of the drug (accounting for incidence/prevalence and pricing potential), and the impact the data may have on the trial and range of outcomes
*   Pricing is typically based on a cost per patient (determined by the above) and the sample size required, with some ability to pay more for faster speed
*   Each research "question" a pharma company may ask is worth $1-5M in spend, with very high likelihood of continued "questions" as a drug moves through the development cycle (once the data is used, it is very sticky for that asset)
*   With the above in mind, it is likely that this category has a "consultative" sale where the vendor works with the company to scope and price each project individually on a project basis vs. a traditional SaaS platform fee -- there is a reoccurring nature to the project because once the data is used, it will be used again for a new use case once the asset moves further along in its development cycle

#### Patient Consented Data Market

*   Has only worked with Picnic Health
    *   Has an AI based method for data extraction that helps consolidate information in an easy to use way
    *   Chose Picnic because they had recruited a cohort in a similar disease area with similar patient demographics -- this gave comfort that they could do work here
*   Ciitizen was also considered, but he was not part of their evaluation
    *   Can't offer more detail beyond that they did not have a patient pool that supported NVS using them for this project

### Minovia Chief Medical Officer

#### RWE in Rare Disease

*   Ultra rare disease requires pharma to define the typical evolution of a patient journey
*   That data is used as a comparator to the experiment group since placebos can't be used in the category
*   There are other uses earlier in development (IND stage), at the same stage (lighter use cases than a comparator arm), and later (traditional market access)
*   To gather the data, options include a natural history study or data collection through RWE vendors, typically patient consented players since this is ultra rare
    *   There is limited information in the public domain of research
    *   NHS has low enrollment rates and are difficult on patients, especially since it's a non-treatment study -- this takes years to decades to do
    *   There are also limitations to medical record collection since the tools and measurements taken in clinical care may not be fit for purpose for an FDA submission and the data sits in multiple places (though patient consented players aggregate it)

#### Patient Consented Data Market

*   Overall, the costs for patient consented data players was high ($1M of total spend) and the companies could not certify that their data could be used as a comparator arm in a Phase II / III trial before data collection
    *   For a biotech company, that is considerable spend with risk that the data may not be high enough quality for the FDA to accept
    *   Considered going directly to the patient advocacy group to collect data directly, but it was difficult
*   Evaluated Ciitizen and Allstripes
    *   Allstripes turned down the business based on pricing and capabilities
    *   Ciitizen stayed in the RFP -- the Praxis IND submission is interesting but is an earlier stage than a Phase II / III comparator arm, which has higher FDA scrutiny

### Praxis Former Patient Advocacy Lead, Rare Diseases

#### Evolution of RWE

*   RWE was initially claims data for commercial use cases
*   In development, RWE helps improve understanding of how a disease presents
*   Patient consented data does is able to bring RWE to rare and ultra rare disease, informing critical tasks like study design, site selection, etc.

#### RWE in Rare Disease

*   Rare and ultra rare diseases don't have standard codes -- data is required to identify patients and understand disease progression
*   Patient consented players collect the full patient history and use AI to understand the data in depth -- it is significantly better than registry or other sources of data
    *   Critical to end point selection and measurement
    *   Educates the company and regulatory bodies on the disease -- many rare conditions do not have research that explains progression
    *   Can be used across the life cycle of a drug because it is a comprehensive set of patient information -- it would be an absolute waste not to use it
*   60% of all new drug applications are in rare diseases

#### Patient Consented Data Pricing & Budget

*   Spending on Ciitizen up front saves companies from increased development costs in the form of amendments, lost time, and more
*   Ciitizen charged a few thousand per patient which was inexpensive relative to development costs had Praxis not used Ciitizen -- the CRO approach is tens to hundreds of thousands per patient
*   There is myopic thinking in the industry -- change management is required to shift spend to Ciitizen vs. throwing money at sites as the traditional approach

#### Patient Consented Data Market

*   Worked with Ciitzen to identify 50 patient families to consent to perpetual data access
*   Data helped Praxis demonstrate that their study design (IND submission) was the right path forward to regulatory bodies -- saved years of additional work and patient burden (5 min on Ciitizen vs. hours of travel, appointments, and tests in an NHS)
*   The process was a learning experience for both groups but the Ciitizen team was excellent
*   Ciitizen's data helped redefine understanding of the disease (deep and foundational information base)
*   Ciitizen can improve by doing PRO, continuing to integrate with other data sources, and moving international

### Praxis - Former Senior Director, Translational Sciences

#### RWE in Rare Disease

*   Natural history of diseases has been typically measured through NHS in early stages of development
*   In rare disease, it is difficult to run a NHS -- fragile population, caregiver burden, etc.
*   Resultingly, RWE has evolved to step in to improve the NHS approach
    *   At Praxis, the end point being measured required EEGS
    *   EEGs are measured in a standard format, helping record collection match what could be done in a traditional NHS (instruments)

#### Patient Consented Data Pricing & Budget

*   Ciitizen charges about $3-5K / patient
*   NHS costs $20-30K / patient
*   Ciitizen could improve pricing to $8-10K / patient
    *   Speed vs. messiness starts to trade off (2x ROI using Ciitizen)
    *   Reducing messiness raises the ceiling
*   Praxis will use the data longitudinally as the asset moves on
    *   Will require a significant amount of FDA interaction to use it as an external control -- the pricing improves to $20-30K / patient
    *   Could / should use it as supplementary data but would pay much less ($5K / patient)
*   Would absolutely use it long-run for favorable access, clinician utilization / education, and Phase IV monitoring

#### Patient Consented Data Market

*   Ciitizen had deep domain expertise and technology for data collection
    *   Ciitizen had a lot of "skin in the game" with epilepsy - Nasha's child has it and the firm broadly had great relationships with patient advocacy
    *   Ciitizen understood the field very well to know what data needed to be collected and how to clean it
    *   Ciitizen's patient acquisition channels were efficient and easy to use for patients, but the foundation has to be engaged -- different studies run with Ciitizen have had different performances
        *   This is largely due to the historical interactions a given foundation may have had with a sponsor -- they can have idiosyncratic views on how the data will / will not be used
    *   Did not see any issues with Ciitizen's ability to gather the data and Ciitizen's ability to consume the information
    *   The sponsor has to go a level deeper on analysis, with support from Ciitizen, because a synthetic NHS for an FDA submission requires deep phenotyping
    *   For Ciitizen to do these analytics and increase value capture, they'd need to have significant depth in a disease area

#### Ciitizen vs. NHS

*   Faster -- traditional NHS can't attract 50-100 patients in 6 months, this is a significant advantage
*   Data -- the data will be messier with Ciitizen since the data sits across records and isn't being done in a controlled study format
*   Ciitizen is best suited for diseases where either an endpoint is known and collected consistently or where there may be no existing data infrastructure -- this is going to bias towards rarer diseases
    *   If an endpoint is known to be based in molecular biology, then Ciitizen data is less useful but can be used to inform new endpoints or secondary endpoints
    *   Ciitizen would also still be useful for patient recruitment even in those instances
*   FDA will provide more guidance over time on what level of "messiness" they're willing to accept, but so far they will not argue against a claim if there is data (i.e., "we should treat patients more aggressively")
*   Did not evaluate other players because Ciitizen had domain expertise

## Appendix G: Patient Advocacy Group Call Notes (July 2021)

### Feedback from foundations has been positive; launch of improved patient application and data visualization tools likely to accelerate traction

*   **Disaggregated records are a big pain point for oncology and rare disease patients**
    *   "Collecting your information is impossible without Ciitizen. It took months and at the end I had to carry my records in a big plastic bin... having records organized is huge for patients" – BBCA
    *   "Patients need one portable record instead of manila folders full of information" – LLS
*   **Foundations are using Ciitizen to advance research**
    *   "Our patients don't know what a clinical trial is let alone how to communicate whether they meet the criteria to participate... providing a report of potential trials is awesome" – BBCA
    *   "Mitochondrial disease is heterogenous and there isn't great data on it... Ciitizen's ability to pull and structure health data to accelerate research is important" – UMDF
    *   "A traditional NHS is burdensome for patients... I chose to work with Ciitizen so that we could accelerate trials to bring essential treatments to market faster" – Syngap1
*   **Patients are satisfied with Ciitizen**
    *   "Everybody loves it; I haven't heard a single negative thing from patients" – BBCA
    *   "Patient feedback was uniformly positive" – UMDF
    *   "Our patients love the product and it isn't even the 'cool' version yet... adding data summaries, trial matching, and other functionality will improve the product even further" – Snygap1
    *   "Patients are thrilled with Ciitizen... we have 700 patients with their records on it and have not heard a single negative view" – CCA
*   **Foundations are satisfied with Ciitizen**
    *   "My first piece of advice to every patient I meet is get a Ciitizen account... Ciitizen is a partner I will never get rid of" - BBCA
    *   "Ciitizen's new visualization product is incredible for synthesizing results... it is an enormously powerful system to filter down patient cohorts... we are using it for a study publication" – LLS
    *   "We wanted to sign up immediately given the problem Ciitizen is solving and because they share data back with us... Ciitizen has strong backend tech to deliver clean data" – Syngap 1
    *   "We looked at 11 different companies to help with clinical trial matching... only Ciitizen was patient first and didn't have a quid pro quo arrangement from the onset" – CCA
*   **Foundations are likely to work exclusively with one patient data aggregator**
    *   "I didn't even think about finding an alternative when I first met Ciitizen" – BCBA
    *   "We wouldn't launch with another provider... it would be confusing for our patients" – LLS
    *   "We interacted with Picnic, but they were too quid pro quo... Ciitizen had a collaborative approach that put our patients first" – CCA
