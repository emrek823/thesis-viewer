## Summary
This proposed rule would prohibit hospitals from performing sex-rejecting procedures (SRPs) on children under Medicare and Medicaid programs. The regulation aims to protect children's health by restricting medical interventions deemed unsafe or inappropriate for minors.

## Startup Angle
Potential opportunities include: 1) A telehealth/advisory platform providing comprehensive gender-affirming mental health support for youth and families, avoiding medical interventions, 2) A policy/regulatory consulting firm specializing in helping pediatric healthcare providers navigate evolving gender-related medical guidelines, 3) A legal tech startup offering compliance monitoring and risk management for pediatric healthcare institutions.       Potential negative impacts would be on existing pediatric surgical and endocrinology practices that currently perform these procedures. Startups like Folx Health or Plume that focus on gender-affirming care might need to dramatically adjust their pediatric service models.
