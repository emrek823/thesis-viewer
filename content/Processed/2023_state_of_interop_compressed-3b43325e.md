## Slide 3: State of Interoperability 2023 - Introduction

# State of Interoperability
# 2023

When it comes to health data exchange, we're at a crossroads. Since the passage of the 21st Century Cures Act and the Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement (TEFCA), the 2023 directive has been clear – health information must be shared electronically with trusted parties.

But concerns over patient privacy and the potential burden of new regulations have resulted in mixed levels of support. Nonetheless, mandates from ONC and accompanying incentives from CMS are accelerating all stakeholders towards a common goal – enabling secure nationwide health information exchange.

In 2022, proposed rules became mandates, value-based care and hybrid care models continued to thrive, yet the financial markets experienced a downturn and funding sources dried up. To understand how 2023 will pan out, we gathered the perspectives of senior executives at leading health systems, EHRs, digital health organizations, and diagnostic labs. These stakeholders generate the data our ecosystem relies on and leverage the data to deliver a great experience for patients and providers. Their opinions on critical issues will help us understand new opportunities and challenges for healthcare interoperability this year.

Our investigation sought answers to critical questions:

How do decision-makers across the industry feel about health information sharing, in the context of the incentives that drive their businesses? How are different healthcare organizations adapting their clinical data strategy in response to new federal initiatives? And what are the 2023 priorities for senior executives around data access, data quality, and data security?

## Slide 4: PART ONE - Health Systems

# PART ONE
# Health Systems

The success of national health information exchange relies on broad participation from health systems. In addition to providing comprehensive clinical data, health systems make available human resources, utilization, and performance metrics data that enable care coordination, effective policy strategy, and alignment between public and private sectors.¹ Given their importance, we investigated the ways in which health systems are accommodating the push for broader data exchange, as well as the setbacks that impede much-needed progress.

## Slide 6: First priority. Help providers get data faster.

# 1 First priority.
# Help providers get data faster.

The primary reason health systems participate in health information exchanges is to help providers get data faster and improve the quality of care.

**Data from health information exchanges is used by health systems for a variety of purposes.**
A majority of health systems respondents use data from health information exchanges to inform patient care.

| Purpose                                                   | Percentage |
| :-------------------------------------------------------- | :--------- |
| Supporting patient care or related visits                 | 83%        |
| Analyzing chronic disease burden or a particular patient population | 55%        |
| Identifying patients who may be due for care (i.e., annual wellness screening) | 50%        |
| Business intelligence purposes                            | 28%        |
| Identifying patients who may be eligible for clinical trials | 20%        |

## Slide 7: Second priority. Maintain a competitive advantage.

# 2 Second priority.
# Maintain a competitive advantage.

By participating in health information exchanges, health systems can maintain a competitive advantage in their markets, build data sharing alliances with other provider organizations, and retain providers by reducing their administrative burden.

## Slide 8: Third priority. Reduce costs and increase reimbursement.

# 3 Third priority.
# Reduce costs and increase reimbursement.

By participating in exchanges and complying with TEFCA, health systems can reduce costs associated with retrieving medical records from other organizations and prepare for future CMS incentives that may reward TEFCA exchange.

**Complying with TEFCA is a priority for health system CIOs.**
While only a quarter of health systems currently comply with the technical standards for TEFCA exchange, two thirds are working towards that goal, in anticipation of TEFCA exchange becoming an influential factor in Medicare reimbursement.

| Compliance Status                                                  | Percentage |
| :----------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------- |
| We are actively working to comply with the technical standards required for TEFCA exchange. | 68%        |
| We already comply with the technical standards required for TEFCA exchange. | 22%        |
| We plan to satisfy HIE measures via a non-TEFCA route.             | 5%         |
| We don't currently comply with the technical standards required for TEFCA exchange. | 5%         |

## Slide 9: Willing to share data for non-treatment purposes? Most say yes.

# Willing to share data for non-treatment purposes?

| Very supportive of the goals of TEFCA                      | 32%        |
| I am not familiar with TEFCA                               | 5%         |
| Neutral / neither supportive nor against                   | 5%         |

**Data security and privacy is a top concern.**
Security and privacy risks and increased burden on engineering teams are among the top concerns voiced by health systems, who are looking to comply with new ONC mandates. Some also lament the lack of health system input in legislation that affects them.

| Concern                                          | Percentage |
| :----------------------------------------------- | :--------- |
| Risks to patient data, security, and privacy     | 31%        |
| Increased burden on engineering / IT teams       | 26%        |
| Expensive to support the necessary infrastructure | 17%        |
| Lack of health system input in legislation       | 15%        |
| Imposed timelines are too aggressive             | 11%        |

## Slide 11: There is room for improvement. Data quality remains an issue.

# There is room for improvement.
# Data quality remains an issue.

**Health system respondents were mixed about the quality of the data received through health information exchanges.**

| Data Quality                                              | Percentage |
| :-------------------------------------------------------- | :--------- |

| 38% found the data to be good quality                     | 38%        |
| 50% found the data to be OK quality – some duplicative, incomplete, or junk data | 50%        |
| 8% found the data to be bad quality - lots of duplicative, incomplete, or junk data | 8%         |
| 2% found the data to be very bad quality - nearly all duplicative, incomplete or junk data | 2%         |

**Most respondents felt the data was reasonably useful for providing care or analytical purposes.**

| Data Usefulness                                                   | Percentage |
| :---------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------- |
| 10% found the data to be extremely useful and regularly applied in care or for analytical purposes | 10%        |
| 45% found the data to be reasonably useful for providing care or for analytical purposes | 45%        |
| 35% found the data to be somewhat useful                          | 35%        |
| 10% found the data to be not as useful as we hoped                | 10%        |

## Slide 12: Interoperability is a priority for 2023.

# Interoperability is
# a priority for 2023.

Over 50% of health system CIOs plan to spend 5-20% more on interoperability initiatives in 2023.

## Slide 13: In 2023, health system CIOs are planning to invest more in interoperability.

# In 2023, health system CIOs are planning
# to invest more in interoperability.

**In 2023, how much do you anticipate spending on interoperability when compared to 2022?**

| Anticipated Spend Compared to 2022 | Percentage |
| :--------------------------------- | :--------- |
| 5-20% higher spend                 | 55%        |
| Roughly the same                   | 43%        |
| 20% or more higher spend           | 2%         |

Not a single respondent indicated less year-over-year spend on interoperability-related initiatives.

## Slide 14: Quote from Dave Cassel

“
As an industry, we clearly have work to do on data quality. Ironically,
the more progress we make on interoperability, the more duplicative
data we will need to deal with, as all record sources for a particular
patient will converge on a shared understanding of that patient's
history. Interoperability services must be able to sift through this
duplication in order to make data meaningful, rather than just passing
duplication along to the user.
”

## Slide 23: Quote from Steve Yaskin

“
Red tape is there for a reason. We are a very different industry —
we have to focus on security, privacy, and compliance. Healthcare has
been slow to adapt but we've seen a tremendous amount of
acceleration this year with the 21st Century Cures Act and the Trusted
Exchange Framework and Common Agreement (TEFCA) finally
gaining ground. I'm very excited about where healthcare is headed.

# Digital health providers exchange data
# through multiple channels.

**Few license commercial EHRs. A majority of respondents build their own software platforms to store patient data.**
Digital health developers derive many benefits from building their own platforms. From tailoring solutions to specific diseases to enabling custom provider workflows, most venture-backed startups are electing to create something new – and proprietary.

| Data Storage Platform                                       | Percentage |
| :---------------------------------------------------------- | :--------- |
| We have developed or are planning to develop our own software platform to store patient data. | 58%        |
| We have licensed or are planning to license a commercial EHR. | 19%        |
| We currently use a commercial EHR, but are planning to develop our own software platform in the future. | 8%         |

**To obtain patient data, digital health companies rely on a variety of methods.**
In lieu of adopting commercial EHRs and accessing EHR data through networks like Epic Care Everywhere, digital health startups must find ways to access historical health records for their patients.

| Method of Obtaining Patient Data                               | Percentage |

## Slide 32: Quote from Jitin Asnaani

“
For digital health, connectivity to the national data exchanges will be table
stakes. Instead, their success in data exchange will be predicated on
functionality that goes beyond plain vanilla "clinical chart" access, including
the ability to access complementary data (e.g., SDOH data) and on the ability
to transform and utilize the data to take meaningful action. This implies data
of higher quality – breadth, depth, and consistency — and most importantly
the functionality to meaningfully transform the data into the insights and
triggers needed to take action during and in between care encounters.

## Slide 33: PART FOUR - Diagnostic Labs

# PART FOUR
# Diagnostic Labs

Diagnostic data represents vital health information that influences a large share of clinical decisions. However, labs pose a unique challenge for achieving national interoperability goals. Within the community, there is debate about whether labs are subject to the same data sharing regulations as other provider organizations, impacting a provider's ability to retrieve their patient's lab results from third-party organizations.

Given the critical role of lab data, why do labs lag behind as participants in health information sharing? What can be done to galvanize more participation?

## Slide 34: We surveyed 31 VPs and CIOs at diagnostic vendors, including top 5 labs.

I think it really shows that a lot of labs
are in the dark. A third appear to be
clueless about their responsibilities under
the Cures Act. And their responsibilities
are significant. Labs are providers.

## Slide 40: Quote from Sergio Wagner

Interoperability continues to be a key focus area for large
health systems, driven by regulatory momentum. Despite
concerns around data security and data quality, it's
encouraging to see broad support for TEFCA among CIOs.

## Slide 41: Conclusion

# Conclusion

Interoperability in healthcare has progressed significantly in recent years.

With the implementation of TEFCA and the anticipated launch of Qualified Health Information Networks, the pace of progress will only accelerate in 2023. If health systems, diagnostic vendors, EHRs, and digital health organizations are planets, spurred on by regulatory momentum, they are approaching similar rotational frequencies. Healthcare actors are becoming increasingly aligned in terms of sharing data, and the center of their galactic orbit is better, cost-efficient patient care.

Still, even as the healthcare ecosystem shows signs of consolidating around shared goals, challenges persist. Diagnostic labs lag behind in data sharing. The quality of data retrieved from health information networks, and its actionability, leaves much to be desired by providers. EHRs and health systems seek non-traditional data types, but will incentives and technology align to deliver this data to providers? Are providers ready for even more data to be available at their fingertips? In addition, there is a long tail of providers who are not meaningfully connected today, such as independent physicians in rural environments, for whom non-participation may not be an option for much longer.

Ultimately, 2023 is the year for implementing the innovative frameworks and programs that have been set in prior years. Bringing these initiatives to fruition through public-private partnerships is the key to unlocking true interoperability, resulting in better outcomes at reduced costs. Enabling secure, seamless data exchange for 332 million Americans is an ambitious goal, but one that requires deep collaboration between dozens of stakeholders, including patients themselves. While many challenges lie ahead, we are fiercely optimistic about the future of healthcare interoperability.
