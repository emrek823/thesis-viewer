# SMB Follow-On Due Diligence: Technical Validation + Epic Risk

Research Date: 2026-01-05 | Source Mix: 60% Vault / 40% Web | Confidence: HIGH

The Take: SMB has delivered since August 2025—JEPA architecture proved out at MSK (+5.8% AUROC vs LLMs on dynamic tasks), Sanofi POC closing with $4.8M contract expected Q1, and 3 ICLR 2026 papers accepted. The multimodal foundation model thesis is validated by market activity: Tempus-AstraZeneca signed a $200M deal, Bioptimus raised $76M for M-Optimus. The critical question isn't whether SMB is executing—they are. It's whether Epic Curiosity (100B patient events, 90%+ hospital distribution, same world-model architecture) commoditizes the space before SMB builds defensible pharma relationships. The answer depends on GTM focus: Epic targets hospital operations; SMB targets pharma R&D. Different buyers, different data governance. Proceed with follow-on, but watch Epic researcher results (Feb 2026) closely.

## Progress Since August 2025 Seed

### Technical Validation

Why this matters: The JEPA architecture specifically excels on dynamic tasks (treatment response, disease progression) where token-prediction LLMs fail. On static classification, LLMs are competitive. The lift is task-specific—and those tasks are what pharma cares about.

"GPT-4 achieves 30.3% completeness on real oncology treatment decisions... Models pass licensing exams but fail on actual clinical trajectory prediction. Root cause: Language is a lossy proxy for biological complexity."

— SMB Technical Memo

Publications:

3 papers accepted at ICLR 2026: GenVarFormer, KRONOS (graph-LLM), EHR Foundation Model

Model weights public on HuggingFace: standardmodelbio/SMB-v1-1.7B-Structure

### Commercial Traction

"Tempus seeking genomics foundation model partners despite this being their strongest area... Unusual request."

— Nov 2025 Meeting Notes

AMC Partnerships (Data + Validation): MSK (validation complete), MD Anderson (active), Yale, UCSD, Mount Sinai, Mayo Clinic

### Team Evolution

Headcount: 8 people. Heavy concentration in AI/ML + genomics.

### Runway & Fundraising

## Deal Benchmarks

What this tells us: Pharma is willing to pay 8-9 figures for foundation model access. SMB's deal sizes are appropriate for stage; the $200M Tempus deal validates the TAM.

The Epic Threat: Epic Curiosity launched Sep 2025 with 100B patient events from 300M patients across 310 health systems. Same world-model concept ("simulates plausible future timelines"). Outperformed 78 single-purpose models without fine-tuning. Researcher access opens Feb 2026.

### Why SMB May Still Win vs Epic

Different buyers: Epic targets hospital operations (length of stay, readmission). SMB targets pharma R&D (drug development, trial optimization).

Data governance: Pharma cannot use Epic's hospital data for proprietary drug development. Data provenance matters.

Architecture edge: JEPA shows +5.8% lift on dynamic tasks where token prediction fails. If Epic matches this, the edge erodes.

First-mover in pharma: SMB has 18+ months of pharma relationship building. Epic is starting from zero in that market.

## Why Multimodal Foundation Models Matter

### Performance Advantage

Vision-language models: Superior zero-shot/few-shot performance vs single-modality in medical imaging

Molecule-text fusion: Significantly improves property prediction over structure-only approaches

EHR + unstructured notes: Enhanced patient representation and treatment effect estimation

"Unlike most other foundation models used in healthcare, M-Optimus is a multimodal, multiscale foundation model that offers a new path toward a unified representation of a patient across tissue, molecular, and clinical levels."

— Bioptimus M-Optimus Announcement

### Market Tailwinds

### Key Bottlenecks

What this means for SMB: Data access is the moat. SMB's AMC partnerships (MSK, MD Anderson, Yale, etc.) are the competitive advantage—not just the architecture.

## Risk Assessment

### Risk Probability Matrix

### What Would Change The Recommendation

Sanofi deal falls through → Reduce to bridge only

Epic Curiosity outperforms on dynamic tasks → Pause investment, reassess JEPA edge

Series A doesn't close by Q2 2026 → Reassess runway risk

Key team departures → Reassess execution capacity

## Questions to Pose in Next Call

### On Epic Competition

Epic Curiosity opens to researchers in Feb 2026. What's your plan when they publish benchmarks? If Epic matches JEPA on dynamic tasks, what's the differentiation?

Epic has 90%+ US hospital distribution. Can pharma access that data for proprietary R&D, or is data governance the moat?

Have any of your pharma prospects mentioned Epic as a consideration? What are they saying?

### On Commercial Traction

Sanofi $4.8M expected Mar/Apr 2026. What are the gating factors? Is there risk of slip?

IQVIA $44M proposal is massive. What's the decision timeline? Who's the internal champion?

Tempus is seeking you as a genomics FM partner despite genomics being their strength. What's really going on there? Is this validation or a strategic threat?

### On Technical Differentiation

The JEPA lift (+5.8%) is specific to dynamic tasks. What % of pharma use cases are dynamic vs static? Is the addressable market for the lift large enough?

The MSK validation is strong. Are you pursuing additional validation sites? What would replicate the result?

### On Series A

What's the target raise size and valuation? Who's leading the round?

10.9 months runway is tight. What's the backup plan if Series A slips?

JPM meetings are lined up. What's the pitch—is it "we beat LLMs on clinical tasks" or "we have pharma deals"?

### On Data Moat

You acquired 1M oncology CTs from Gradient for $150K. What's the data acquisition strategy for 2026? How do you scale this?

Nash Bio partnership gives you Vanderbilt multimodal data. Is this exclusive? What's the commercialization path?

## Summary Assessment

### What SMB Got Right Since Seed

Technical validation: Proved JEPA lift at MSK with real clinical data (+5.8% AUROC)

Publication velocity: 3 ICLR 2026 papers, model weights public on HuggingFace

Commercial traction: Sanofi closing, $44M IQVIA proposal, diversified pharma pipeline

Team velocity: Irsyad (ICLR + PhD in first month), Zekai (ACL paper in 1 week)

Data partnerships: MSK, MD Anderson, Yale, UCSD, Mount Sinai, Mayo Clinic

### What Needs Watching

Epic Curiosity: Feb 2026 researcher results will reveal if JEPA edge holds

Runway pressure: 10.9 months is tight; Series A timing is critical

Sanofi execution: $4.8M contract is the proof point—any slip is a red flag

Tempus dynamic: Are they partner or competitor? The answer matters.

Bull Case: Pharma cannot access Epic's hospital data for proprietary R&D (data governance moat). JEPA architecture proves fundamentally superior for trajectory prediction, and competitors cannot replicate without similar data partnerships. SMB becomes the "quiet backbone" for pharma AI. Sanofi $4.8M closes, IQVIA $44M follows. Winner-take-all dynamics emerge as SMB aggregates more AMC data than anyone else.

Bear Case: Epic Curiosity matches JEPA performance on dynamic tasks—the architecture edge was temporary, not fundamental. Pharma decides to work with Epic anyway (or builds in-house using Epic as foundation). Series A slips due to market conditions; runway runs out before Sanofi contract signs. Bioptimus or Tempus achieve multimodal integration first with larger data pools.

## Recommendation

PROCEED with $1.25M follow-on.

The technical validation, commercial traction, and team velocity justify continued investment. The primary risk (Epic) is real but mitigated by different GTM focus. Monitor these triggers:

## Appendix: Key Quotes

On why pharma can't build internally (Kevin Brown, ex-BMS):

"Data was scattered across different departments... Data access was weaponized to retain departmental clout... Digital pathology and genomics in research; radiology and trial data in drug development; RWD in another department... Weights & Biases took 1 year to install at BMS vs <5 days at Adobe."

On the JEPA advantage:

"JEPA architecture... Predicts in latent space, not token space... Models state transitions: (Pre-State + Intervention) → Post-State. The lift is specific to dynamic tasks (treatment response, progression). On static classification, LLMs are competitive. On trajectory prediction, JEPA dominates."

On GTM strategy:

"GTM = data acquisition strategy. Revenue comes from pharma. AMCs provide validation + data access. Revenue buys more data access. Flywheel... Once we get a plurality, not working with us fundamentally limits their AI performance, which is unacceptable."

On Tempus seeking SMB:

"Tempus seeking multimodal foundation model partners... Sliding scale pricing: $4M if no IP/model weights retained, 50% discount if Standard Model gets model weights... Unusual request: Tempus seeking genomics foundation model partners despite this being their strongest area."
