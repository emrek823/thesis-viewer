Danny Rimer, a partner at Index Ventures, has just come off one of his best years in venture capital. Now, at 55, it’s time for him to think about retirement.

This has nothing to do with Rimer or his firm’s performance. After starting out as a boutique, family-run investor, Index has evolved into possibly the most successful venture capital firm out of Europe. While many VCs have struggled to deliver returns, the firm has enjoyed a flurry of profitable exits. What started out as $2 million investment into web design company Figma Inc. turned into a $2.2 billion stake after its initial public offering last summer. And Index could soon generate billions more from its bet on Wiz, the Israeli cybersecurity startup that Google agreed to buy.
