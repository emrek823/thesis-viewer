## Summary
FDA is standardizing its Bioresearch Monitoring inspection processes by creating clear guidance for how inspections will be conducted and what information must be provided. This guidance aims to create more transparency and consistency in how the FDA reviews clinical research sites and facilities.

## Startup Angle
A compliance software startup focused on clinical trial management could benefit significantly by building tools that help research organizations precisely track and prepare documentation for these FDA inspections. Companies like Medrio, Forte Research Systems, or a new entrant could develop AI-powered documentation and readiness platforms that automate the preparation of records and communication protocols specifically aligned with this new FDA guidance.
