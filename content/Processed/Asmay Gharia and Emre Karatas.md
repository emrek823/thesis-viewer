### Company Background & Scientific Foundation

- Asmay co-founded Rivulet Bio after research at UC Berkeley (2014-2018) and University of Cambridge (2020-2023)
- Initially focused on implantable sensors for real-time cancer diagnostics during early CAR-T therapy boom
- Identified manufacturing gap: companies optimizing delivery without addressing patient-specific cell differences
- Developed hardware platform at Cambridge using brain-computer interface advances
	- Single-use cartridge for individual cell positioning and manipulation
	- Real-time sensing and stimulation capabilities
	- Predictive efficacy modeling for therapy outcomes

### Scientific Validation Results

- NIH partnership for myeloid cell therapy (rhabdomyosarcoma solid tumors)
	- Notoriously sensitive cell type that “dies if you look at it funny”
	- Standard viral modification: 4-5% efficacy
	- Leading competitor platform: 14% efficacy
	- Rivulet prototype (unoptimized): 41% efficacy
- Key insight: measure every individual cell and tune approach per cell
	- Traditional 10x efficiency improvements don’t scale without per-cell optimization
	- End users won’t manually optimize for every patient
	- “Push button” automation essential for consistent results

### Current Traction & Market Position

- Raised $450K friends & family funding
- Immediate customer demand after NIH results
	- “Holy shit, we want to buy hundreds of these”
	- Requests for master file support and IND backing
- Hit inflection point: larger customers requiring cGMP-grade devices
	- Won’t optimize processes on research-use products without long-term partnership confidence
	- Need clinical-grade manufacturing within 18 months

### Fundraising Strategy

- Seeking $5M seed round with lead investor at 30-50%
- Tranching approach possible but not preferred:
	- $3M: supports 1-3 cGMP devices for earliest customers
	- $5M: supports up to 20 customer partnerships
- 12 months runway on current $450K
- 18-month timeline to deliver 20 cGMP devices once funded
- Started fundraising 1.5 weeks ago

### Next Steps

- Emre to review deck and research within one week
- Emre to share with other investors familiar with bio/cell therapy space
- Company prefers quick decision timeline (weeks not months)
- Focus on finding lead investor with:
	- Cell therapy manufacturing expertise
	- Portfolio company synergies
	- Hiring network access
