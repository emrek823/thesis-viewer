## Fivetran and dbt Labs Unite to Set the Standard for Open Data Infrastructure

October 13, 2025

Together, Fivetran and dbt are simplifying enterprise data management with a unified foundation that powers analytics and AI at scale.

**OAKLAND, Calif., October 13, 2025 —** Fivetran, the global leader in automated data movement, signed a definitive agreement today to merge in an all-stock deal with dbt Labs, the pioneer of modern data transformation. Under the agreement, George Fraser will serve as CEO of the unified company, and dbt Labs CEO Tristan Handy will serve as co-founder and President. Following close of the transaction, the combined company will be approaching $600M in annual recurring revenue (ARR).

Fivetran and dbt share a long-standing belief that data infrastructure should be open, automated, and effortless. The combination brings complementary strengths together to deliver open data infrastructure — which unifies data movement, transformation, metadata, and activation while preserving freedom of choice for analytic compute and AI.

As part of this transaction, the company is committed to keeping dbt Core open under its current license and maintaining it with and for the community, ensuring its development remains vibrant.

“This is a refounding moment for Fivetran and the broader data ecosystem,” said George Fraser, CEO of Fivetran. “As AI reshapes every industry, organizations need a foundation they can trust — one that is open, interoperable, and built to scale with their ambitions. Our admiration for dbt and its remarkable community runs deep — this is about bringing together the best of both worlds to accelerate innovation and create lasting impact across the data community.”

The unification of Fivetran and dbt sets the standard for open data infrastructure, a new approach that reduces engineering complexity by automating data management end to end. It works across any compute engine, catalog, BI tool, or AI model, is built on open standards like SQL and Iceberg, and remains flexible so organizations avoid lock-in and can scale with future workloads.

“dbt has always stood for openness and practitioner choice,” said Tristan Handy, founder of dbt Labs. “For nearly a decade, I’ve worked to build data infrastructure that supports every engine, every format, every model, every tool, that acts as an abstraction layer across an entire ecosystem. By merging with Fivetran, we can accelerate that mission and deliver the open data infrastructure that practitioners and enterprises need in the AI era.”

The transaction has been approved by the Boards of Directors and shareholders of both companies. Finalization of the merger remains subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. Until then, Fivetran and dbt Labs will continue to operate as separate, independent companies.

Qatalyst Partners served as exclusive financial advisor to Fivetran, Deloitte & Touche LLP as due diligence advisors, Wilson Sonsini Rosati & Goodrich P.C. served as lead legal advisor, and DLA Piper LLP also served as Fivetran’s legal advisor. Morgan Stanley served as the exclusive financial advisor to dbt Labs and Latham & Watkins LLP served as its legal advisor.
