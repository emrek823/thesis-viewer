**Q: Please clarify if you have evaluated or invested in AI automation solutions such as benefits verification, prior authorization, patient engagement, and 340B eligibility. Please elaborate on your experience**
**A:** We use Latent AI and Atlas Health which are both AI platforms used in prior authorization and patient assistance. We have evaluated Mandolin, Plenful and Corti.

## Client
Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today about Mandolin Health. To start off, I would love to hear a bit about your background and experience in the space.

## Expert
Yeah. I appreciate the level setting. I'm a chief pharmacy officer. I think in particular, everyone is focusing on my most recent chief pharmacy officer role, but I am switching over to a larger academic medical center within the next week or two. I can talk about my previous one that's an active customer of a couple of AI vendors, and I'm sure I'll make the same assessment when I go to the large academic medical center in a couple weeks.

It was an opportunity for a pretty big promotion and bigger opportunities, so I just recently took that. My role there was a chief pharmacy officer. I was also the vice president of system-wide procurement. It's all of strategic sourcing, contracting, non-pharmaceutical purchasing, as well as all of pharmacy purchasing. We were what we consider a mid-level IDN.

We had four acute care hospitals, but we had 11 outpatient pharmacy locations. That included community pharmacy, specialty pharmacy. We also had a central fill. We have multiple oncology infusions and non-oncology infusions. All of those were actually owned under the pharmacy banner. That's why we said we had 11 spaces there.

I'm on the younger side, still not 40 years old yet. Very much tapped into AI leveraging the technology as much as possible space, looking at different ROI models and how do you justify that. It's definitely a space that I have a lot of interest in as well. We had two AI vendors that we were actively partnered with that I brought on board when I was there, both Layton AI, but also Atlas Health.

We had evaluated Mandolin, which we were going down the pathway of bringing them in as well, but not completely done with that. Had also evaluated Plenful and Corti as potential partners at one point in time, but again decided to go with some of the ones that I already mentioned before.

## Client
That's really helpful context. Let me kick off with just some questions about the problem space. I'd love to understand what is the end-to-end workflow looks like right now when it comes to specialty medications and where do you see problems across that workflow traditionally, whether it's in terms of administrative overhead, prior auth delays, reimbursement, compliance? I'm trying to catalog what is the journey looks like traditionally and where are there problems along the way? What problems are these AI companies solving?

## Expert
Yeah. I think you're hitting all of them. If I take a step back, that's one of the fundamental, I don't want to say flaw, but potential flaws with some of these AI vendors. Everyone's saying, "Well, hey, I can help solve a piece of specialty pharmacy optimization." My long-term concern with that is I don't want to have multiple vendors within a single space. We were a beta partner with Loopback Analytics, which is not an AI, but it's how you do better reporting and those kinds of things for specialty pharmacy.

We were working with Emporos for point of sales analytics and those kinds of things. When I take a step back just looking across my specialty pharmacy, that's not even mentioning all the build and all the stuff that we have within Epic and the Willow Ambulatory space there. You're starting to talk about, there's already four vendors that we have that are helping us "optimize specialty pharmacy".

Not to mention 340B, which 340B is not just in specialty. We use it across the gamut. We've got another two vendors that are helping us with 340B optimization. I've said this multiple times, whether it'd podcasts or standing on stage about certain things that AI is great. I think the actual ROI model is going to become murky, especially if everyone's like, "Well, I'm just going to solve this part and then I'm going to leave everything else, then someone else is going to come along and sell your product for that." I just want to put that out there.

When I think about the problem statement, it really should be about optimization of the specialty pharmacy model as a whole is fraught with, I say, administrative burden. Really a lot of that administrative burden has been introduced within the last decade as "cost savings" or utilization determination by payers and a little bit of things from the actual pharmaceutical manufacturers themselves.

I think if we all took a step back and looked at all sides of that payer manufacturer and provider, we would say we're probably not saving anybody money or time. We have just created this system that is inefficient and is not driving any savings to the bottom line for patients. Much of it as, how do you peel that onion back? Who's the first one that says, "Okay, we messed up here, we're going to go back"? That's one of the fundamental issues.

Answering your question from a high-level perspective, the workflow for specialty pharmacy in its most basic terms is that you've got a patient, they are requiring a medication. I will tell you, a lot of times the physician doesn't know that like, "Hey, this is a specialty product." A lot of times they are just being told like, "Hey, there is this new product, maybe it's a biologic, or it's more targeted therapy, whatever it may be, that is beneficial to this patient."

We try to do a lot of things like clinical pathways and having pharmacists available to our physicians to help coach them on what's the right therapy. The physician is essentially going to just prescribe that medication within the way our physicians operate within the electronic medical record. It will tell them at the time of prescribing that like, "Hey, this is a specialty drug. We would ideally like you to send it to our specialty pharmacy so that we can work on it on behalf of that patient and then also let the patient know that they're not going to get it like day one."

They can't just turn around and walk to the pharmacy they normally do that it's going to take a little bit of time. Our physicians have been trained through that, so they know. They will typically coach the patient of like, "Hey, you're going to get a call from our pharmacies. Make sure you pick it up or they're going to message you through MyChart," which is the interface available through Epic, to be able to talk to a patient on their phone. Just pick up, let them know.

That prescription obviously, if it comes to us, goes through a pathway, if it goes to an external, a biologics or CVS or something like that, they've got their own workflows. For us, when it comes in, we essentially do first thing is benefits investigation. What insurance does this patient have? Does this insurance even cover things like specialty medications? Do they have specific formularies? Are there restrictions? Can we even fill it here?

We may immediately see a certain insurance company where like, "We know we can't fill that. We actually have to send it to CVS or we have to send it to McKesson Biologics or something along those lines." That's that benefits investigation from a high-level perspective. We sometimes will step in and talk to a patient like, "Hey, you bought this insurance off the exchange. It actually doesn't have any part D coverage. We can help you find something on exchange that does both so that you're covered."

Even potentially help them sign up for if they qualify for Medicaid, but they're not enrolled in Medicaid or even a Medicare. Maybe they need an advantage plan. That's what our benefits investigation team will do is to try to help set that patient up for current and then future success. The next part of that is prior authorization. Prior authorization is where a lot of these solutions play because it is the one that is a lot of back and forth with the insurance companies, they're prolonged. They can be spread out over a couple of days.

That requires you to have a robust enough workflow in place of like, "Well, hey, I put this authorization in for this patient a couple days ago, and I was still waiting to hit back. I got to make sure that I go back and check that. What happens if I'm off? Do we keep a central list so another technician can pick that up and do it?" It's just a process itself that's a little fraught with holes and workflow issues.

In that prior authorization process, they're basically almost doing the same thing of benefits and investigation, but it's really just focused on that drug. It's like, "Okay, they have insurance. It can be filled at ours. Now let's go through the process of making sure that we put in all the information required to actually qualify this patient to receive this medication."

Insurance companies may have tiers and they may have step ups and all those kinds of things, which is essentially saying that like, "Hey, you can use this drug, but we need to make sure that you have fulfilled other criteria previously." That may be that you've got certain labs on file that are showing that you're having disease progression. It may be looking for imaging that shows that you have it in a specific whatever it may be, let's say, a malignancy in a certain place. It may be asking for genotyping and phenotyping if they did something from a genomics perspective.

It's going to provide a lot of that what really qualifies this patient to be on it and maybe ask some questions of like, "Okay, did you try this cheaper drug at first, and then they failed it, and then now you're asking to step up into this more expensive medication? What are the clinicals? Let me see actual feedback from the physician that's telling me that yes, they've done everything that they thought was appropriate, and then they've ended up on this medication, needing it."

You're taking all that information and submitting it to the insurance company on behalf of the patient. A lot of times you're doing that through their portal. You're logging into that insurance company's portal, you're entering in all the patient's information, you're loading up all their documents, you're pulling all that stuff across, and then you're submitting that on behalf of the patient saying that like, "Hey, I'm requesting prior authorization as the IDN or as the specialty pharmacy to fill for them. Here's all the supporting evidence that you required for it."

Like I said before, there's going to be some back and forth. Sometimes you get it immediately, sometimes it's just a quick like, "Hey, you've checked all the boxes, you've told me you submitted all this information and that's good enough for me. Maybe we'll go back and audit it another time. Right now, we feel like, 'Hey, that's fine.'" It could be like, "Hey, thanks for submitting it. We'll get back to you within the next 24 hours." You just get something back within 12-18 hours or something like that later to say, "Hey, yeah, you're good."

Sometimes you just you don't hear from them, so you got to pick up the phone and call them. Sometimes you get a denial where they say, "Hey, what you submit, it's not good enough. We have some additional questions or based on what you submitted, this patient actually doesn't qualify from that. They should be going back to another medication."

All that requires that technician or that prior authorization specialist to essentially engage back and forth with that insurance company. If they do get a denial, or it's like, "Hey, you don't have enough information," then they've got to then now connect back to either that pharmacist or the physician to essentially say, "Hey, we need to figure this out," and either, "Is there more documentation available? Can we bring the patient back in to run this lab?" Is it, "Hey, this is valid, we shouldn't be prescribing this medication, let's get them on something different"?

All of those are very real outcomes that may occur. Once that prior authorization is received or, "Hey, we're going to switch the patient to another therapy," then you go into really what I would call the last phase of it, which is patient assistance. Sometimes you would think that happens at the same time, but it doesn't. Now, you got a prior authorization for the patient saying, "Yep, hey, they got insurance, we're going to go ahead and clear it for them. The drug costs $10,000 a month and we're going to pay $7,000 a month."

The patient is responsible for $3,000 a month. There are very few people that can afford $3,000 a month out of pocket. We've got another part of our team that's going to focus on, "Hey, do I work with the manufacturer to get them a copay card? Do I look out and find other grants or other dollars available to those patients? Do we enroll them in payment," whatever it may be, but they're just focused on helping that patient get access to that medication as a whole.

They're then that last phase, and then there's an accessory portion of that, which you touched on, which is like, "What am I doing from a 340B compliance? How am I supporting and providing analytics for, whether it be payers, whether it be manufacturers?"

They could come back at any time, especially certain drugs, you think like Revlimid and all those kinds of things, they'll come back and say, "Hey, we need to see that you sufficed all these requirements before you provided this drug to the patient. Did you get positive contact with them? Did you ask them certain questions? Did you make sure that they were being adherent," all this kind of things.

All of which requires a level of analytics that may not be readily available to a lot of people or a lot of specialty pharmacies out there. There is that regulatory/ancillary space that's out there. I would say within all of those places, there is some company that's looking to say, "Hey, we can help you out with this. We can reduce the time of this administrative burden, this, that and the other."

I think they all have their own value propositions. The actual physical dispensing of it is not super hard. We do have a central fill. We've got a lot of automation there, but that doesn't really require a lot of AI or anything along those lines. You can get a Parata machine and those kinds of things.

We have simple things like, "Hey, some of these drugs have to be kept at a specific temperature. How you send them out? Do you have a temperature monitor inside? Is it also reporting back into your EMR that it was kept at the right temperature, it arrived at the patient's house on time. Therefore, the patient is good to take it."

Again, you have those kinds of things. They're not as detrimental to your overall workflows. Again, you may only have a couple of drugs that require something like that. Happy to expand on anything. Trying to make sure I put everything in there that I could think of off the top of my head.

## Client
That's super helpful. I really like how you laid out that workflow. It makes a ton of sense to me. How much value would you say there is at stake across this whole workflow? I know that's a hard question because there's a lot of different vectors of ROI. There's prior auth. It's about getting the patients faster, so you can speed up time to fill and improve on the revenue cycle side. Same with benefits investigation. There are also admin costs. You probably have a lot.

I've heard that some health systems, they don't have enough positions filled to keep up with all this stuff. They are looking for automation solutions. Let's say there was a solution out there that could do all of what you're describing instead of tackling individual parts of it, how much value do you think that would create for the health system? How much do you think that contract would be worth to a vendor like that? I'm just trying to understand how big the problem is in terms of willingness to pay.

## Expert
Yeah, you're right. I would just say, as a health system leader that's heavy in this space, we probably just wouldn't trust that like, "Hey, there's one vendor that's wrapped this all up." I think we're still a number of years away from that, and I continue to push to people that AI's hype and promise is much higher than what it actually delivers. You would have a lot of pushback on that just from even proposing that question because you're like, "Okay, what does it really look like to eliminate or automate away a sizable portion of our FTE span?"

I would say, if I were to lay out some of the bigger opportunities within specialty pharmacy is certainly growth. Being able to say, "Hey, based on my current allocation of resources, build this that and the other, am I capturing every specialty pharmacy drug that's being generated within my health system or potentially even looking outside of my health system to independent physicians or something? Am I getting everything I possibly can?"

There are some health systems that are right there, and it's getting everything. There are others that like, "We're doing as much as we can, but we've got to justify the resources that we've got to find the right people that can embed within these physicians," or "We just have to convince the physicians in these clinics that this is important." That was a huge issue that I had at my last institution. The physicians could look at it and they go, "Okay, it's not my job to help sell your services. You do you and you figure out how to get the prescriptions." It's not my job to do that.

I think number two is just erosion. It's probably easy way whether it's margin erosion due to increasing costs, whether it's the challenges we're seeing from the 340B in the manufacturing space, you can loop that in with contract pharmacy. If you put this all under the same specialty pharmacy, contract pharmacy umbrella. The workforce is probably that other really big one out there that you're completely right.

Even if we were able to come to the table and say, "Hey, any 20 FTEs, you can't sell them, you can't maintain them either." People are not going into these roles and sitting there for 20 years anymore. They're just not. Maybe they move within your own health system. Right now, if you can keep a technician for three years, you're doing something right. We're not like that. We got double-digit turnover within the first year.

What's that value? I still think the best value is to be able to turn it around to saying that this blunts your need for FTEs for your growth phase. If you're a newer established specialty pharmacy or you're an optimized specialty pharmacy, which is what a lot of them are, these pharmacies go through rapid growth phases. Even ours that was already seven years old, we weren't fully optimized, but we were doing double digit growth year-over-year.

In that it's like, "Well, then I got to get five more technicians this year, seven more technicians this year." If AI can say, "Well, hey, that's what you would typically need," but what if you got that same growth with just one, that's value. If it's able to say, "Hey, you're already an optimized specialty pharmacy and you've got a lot of vacancies, what if you just could let all those FTEs go to attrition?" That's real value.

That's something that you can easily see and put it on the P&L and create those kinds of ratios to show finance of like, "Yes, I'm paying this for this AI. We didn't need to bring on or maintain some of these additional FTEs." Those are the kind of things that I think create real value. You can clearly see it on a P&L. Is it a static dollar? I don't know. I've always pushed on these AI vendors of like, "Just give me a flat fee. Don't connect it to percentages, don't connect it to my top line revenue."

This is just a computer program thinking. The same thing of like Epic or even Microsoft products. Just let me take that essentially and say that like, "Hey, this is providing me efficiencies and either it's going to allow me to reduce FTEs or as I'm growing, I don't have to invest in as many FTEs."

## Client
Got it. I know that there's no solution that can do all of it, but it's more of a hypothetical question. I want to understand how lucrative this space is on the vendor side because I don't really have a good sense for that. I saw Mandolin, for example, in their recent funding announcement, had shared that they had had a $10 million contract with someone. I'm trying to understand if that's the contract that they won, then they might have been expected to deliver a multiple of that in terms of ROI.

If a vendor could do the whole workflow that we're describing and could help you on both the administrative side and in terms of reduced FTE ratios, but then also on the revenue side in terms of specialty drug capture and prior auth and so on, how much is that worth to a health system? Of course, it depends on the health system size. How would you approximate that?

The perspective I'm taking is, if I want to build a company in the space, I want to understand, for this to be a $100 million revenue company, how many health systems does that mean you're going out and selling, knowing that you're not going to be able to do it all on day one, but you want to build up to that.

## Expert
Yeah. Much of that is going to boil down to their size and maturity. It's really going to be tough. I would say the willingness of that chief pharmacy officer and team to reduce FTEs or really show that value. For us, I'll give my real-life example. Our specialty pharmacy would bring in probably about tens of millions annual top line. When we look at net, I want to say we were about low double-digit millions that we were able to bring in and hit to the bottom line.

Again, we're not that far from a big one. I think we were just really getting into that optimization phase. When I took over as a chief pharmacy officer for the last couple years, our contract with Latent, we were basically paying them about 5 figures a month. Our goal was to create a multiplier of about a 4X. Most of that was going to come from FTE savings from not only like, "Hey, where we are and we're already optimized, but we're really stabilized," but then also helping us get into that growth phase without as many additional investments.

Year one, off of that $400,000, we were expected to have a net impact of around $1 million. By year five, it would be about $3 million to $3.6 million. I was factoring in growth, some level of attrition, and working it from there. Again, we were not a big health system. We were early adopters to it. That's our real-life example. I would say the easiest way to think about it is this, because I know I'm probably not 100% answering your question is probably one of those spaces that I just don't know how to confidently give an answer on.

Most health systems, their only growth engine right now is going to be specialty pharmacy. Everything else is, I think, going to be compromised. When you look at recent legislation coming out of Washington, every health system is going to really just say, "We've got to push specialty pharmacy because we're going to have to build up a war chest because everything is going to get more expensive with lower revenues. We're going to see less matriculation into healthcare careers because of not having public student loan forgiveness.

Everything across the board for health systems right now isn't really looking good. Everyone is going to double click into like, "What's making me money right now in specialty pharmacy?" I think you're going to see a willingness for more people to invest in it because you can't be in that space where it's like, "Well, yes, I know there's value and I know we can get there. We're going to take the next five years to get there." No, health systems are going to say, "How do we get optimized in the next two to three years?"

## Client
That's really helpful context. I want to actually dive into some of the vendors you've been talking about. Maybe we start with Latent, and then I'd love to hear more about Atlas and then also the ones you evaluated, like Mandolin, Plenful, Corti. Maybe we start with the ones that you brought on. I'd love to learn more about, in the case of the ones you've implemented, what is it that they did for you across that workflow? Where do they focus on? I want to hear about some of the pros and cons of each, both for the ones you implemented and the ones you didn't move forward with.

## Expert
Yeah. I'll start with Latent because Latent is our second oldest vendor. Atlas is actually our oldest one that we've been with. Latent, I met a little bit over a year and a half ago at an HMA academy, which is just a bunch of chief pharmacy officers. The biggest thing there was that they just had their two partners, their two beta partners, which were Yale and Ochsner, and they just had those chief pharmacy officers and other directors get up and talk about the product.

Not really from a sales perspective, but this is our journey to leveraging AI within this space. Here is the actual impact. They gave some positives and some negatives about it, but for me, it was like, "Okay, this is that application of an MLM, an AI space that actually makes a lot of sense."

I reached out to him during the conference and we made this connection and really brought them in to talk to my specialty pharmacy team. Everything that they were showing, they were like, "Yeah, we've got the same problem." We just have to keep hiring techs and more and more techs and more and more techs just to do the prior authorization process.

If it could automate it, we could either need less techs as we scale, we could redeploy those technicians to other things, or we're not doing so well, like refill retention or getting patients signed up in the mail order or even our adherence packaging. There are other jobs that we could leverage those technicians with, but they're focusing so much of their time right now in the prior authorization space. We had to create this whole shared ROI with them because our finance team really wanted it, even though it's annoying because it's not costing us that much.

Finance just saw that of like, "Well, isn't this just making your jobs easier at the expense of margin for the health system?" We had to really come to the table and say, "What does this look like to generate a real ROI that we could point to on a P&L?" A lot of that had to do with true attrition of resources. We set out to say that like, "Hey, we were going to reduce the staff required to do this by up to mid double-digits by the end of our third year together." That's part of our ROI, and we already started going down that pathway before I left.

They were really good. There were some good and some bad with it. There were certain things that day one, it's like, "Okay, this is great." There were other things that's like, "Hey, we're still working through this. It's not really giving us what we thought we needed, but we're going to continue working together." Latent was great. They're really good partners.

Atlas was a very interesting journey for us. We've been with Atlas for almost five years, so they were one of our earliest. They call it AI, feel like machine learning, but they focused on basically the patient or the pharmaceutical assistant portion of it. Not prior authorization, but just like, "Hey, this person's on this drug now, how do we ensure that they can afford it?" They really started off in our infusion space. That was on the Part B portion of their coverage, looking at hospital outpatient departments and the non-hospital outpatient department, like infusions and those kinds of things.

The reason we went down the pathway with them was just because in some of our spaces where pharmacy didn't own infusion at the time, so we're winding the clock. Five years ago, we had just people that couldn't tell you how expensive any drug was trying to do prior authorization and patient assistance for patients in oncology and non-oncology. To them, it was an afterthought. They don't care.

They weren't the ones having to explain why we wrote off $400,000 worth of a drug. It just wasn't their responsibility. It kept falling back on pharmacy of like, "Oh, what's going on with your guys' profitability, blah, blah, blah," and like, "We got all these write-offs, we got all these denials, what's going on?"

We really brought in Atlas and even though I wasn't chief pharmacy officer, I led the project of, at a minimum, let's make sure that all of our transactions are running through some level of AI where it can make sure that we're going to receive the right revenue or it's going to put up a flag to say, "Hey, I couldn't find anything for this patient and I think their out-of-pocket responsibility is going to be really high."

We initially approached them with them doing the work for us. What didn't work with that was then they were getting paid. Yes, their technicians were doing some of the work, but then they were getting paid based on the value of the medications that they were helping us from a patient assistance perspective. We were paying them seven figures.

We're like, "This isn't working." We need to completely rethink that model. We did and got them on a flat fee as well, and then we took it over so that now our technicians leverage the platform and then we just pay a flat fee to essentially apply the platform across all of our organizations. Those are the two we've been with. Like I said, we've been with Loopback Analytics for some years as well. We were an early beta partner with them and investors. That's just analytics and reporting that's required for manufacturers and insurance companies.

Mandolin, met them maybe about a year ago, and really good conversations with them. I think the biggest challenge that we saw with Mandolin is that their product was really focused in the infusion space. They were prior authorization under the Part B benefit, where specialty is all out. Part D, it's a completely separate thing. For us, it was just like, "Well, hey, these two products are similar. One's for specialty and one's for infusion."

Where we knew the money was specialty, which is why when our IT teams like, "Hey, we can only get one of these done in the next year or so, which one do you want?" It was we're obviously going to go at Latent because that's where the revenues are, and that's where we can really generate a strong ROI to prove that AI in this space can really work. It's not saying that Mandolin wasn't good or what. I'm not saying that they didn't have a good product. It's just like they were focused in infusion.

The challenge with infusion is what I talked about earlier is that one infusion wasn't centralized for the prior authorization and patient assistance portion of it. It was every single infusion location we had, which was 13 of them. The staff there were doing their own prior authorization and patient assistance, and they were not all pharmacy staff.

Frankly, they didn't all give a shit either. We had to really sit back and go, "Okay, how do we pull it all together," one, and then say, "Hey, we're going to do introduce AI and then how do we also generate savings?" That's going to have to be a reduction in staff. That wasn't all going to be up to us because again, all that staff didn't report to us in the end of pharmacy.

For us, it was one of those like, "Mm, we're not really sure how you pull this off and generate the value," which that value has to be to a degree of reduction or some efficiency gain in the FTE portion of it because infusion is not a massive growth engine right now. It was for us because we were opening new infusion centers. I think it's a little bit more contained and constrained.

Again, like I said, I think there's value there, but you would see the most value when it's like, "Hey, infusion is all owned by this one team." Regardless of where a patient receives an infusion, that's like being done in a "outpatient space," it's all owned by this team. They all centralize prior authorization in the patient assistance portion of it.

We're going to pull this team together, we're going to apply this AI and then we're going to do some reduction in forces or we're going to redeploy these FTEs elsewhere because we now have this AI engine that's able to do a lot of it. We just weren't able to prioritize that and pull it off. I think that if you check back in with my system in a year from now, maybe they have. By the time I was walking out the door, we just had other bigger opportunities on our plate that we were focusing on and it just wasn't there.

## Client
For a health system typically health system, what is the split between specialty drug and infusion revenue or does it vary a lot?

## Expert
Specialty is probably two or three to one, if not potentially high. Again, infusion can be divided into subcategories too. Oncology, infusion, and specialty are probably one to one because oncology is still going to generate a lot of money and most of that's coming from the infusion portion of it. If you're just talking about non-oncology infusions like your Tysabris and Ocrevus, that's going to be fractional in nature compared to specialty pharmacy revenues. When we bring them all together, all the specialty, all of infusion together, the specialty is king there, much higher.

## Client
Got it. Sorry, you were talking about Plenful.

## Expert
Yeah. Plenful, they just came to the game a little bit later. One of the big things just to keep on your radar, one of the biggest challenges with all this right now is 100% governance as it relates to a lot of health systems in bringing in these platforms. You will hear, whether on the investor side of the product side or the purchaser side, to get these things up and running, you're talking about one+ year, if not longer.

Most of that because there's limited bandwidth from the IT teams. IT security is a big issue. A lot of health systems are now creating these AI governance structures which are filled with people that have no idea what the actual workflows are and what the problem statement is. They will listen to pitches from bigger AI companies or AI companies that are up and coming saying, "We can solve all your problems just with one AI company." Yet, they have no expertise in any of the individual workflows or really know what some of the problems are that are out there.

We started creating these heady structures. I know my organization did and others that I talked to, they're like, "We've just gotten caught up in this web of "AI governance," which is really just we're slowing everything down because we don't understand anything." That was the issue with Plenful. We couldn't even really do a really strong evaluation in comparison between them and Latent AI because it was just like, "Hey, if we pause this process now, then we're not going to get Latent for another year."

If we really sit down and ask this governance team to look and understand the difference between both of them and the nuances, they were like, "Oh, we can get to that in eight months." We're like, "F that. We can't sit around and wait for something like that for so long. We just got to jump on it." Plenful, they seem pretty cool. I think I definitely was liking what they were showing. Easily compared them to what Latent was bringing for the table. We just couldn't sit there and wait for it. We just had to move on.

The other one was Corti. Corti was interesting because again, they were one that was brought to the table by our IT AI governance. It was like, "Hey, these guys are moving into healthcare and they think they can solve everything with these MLMs." It was like, "Okay, but what can they do now?" Right then there was like, "Well, nothing." It's just like, "Okay, well then I'm not going to start from scratch with them to help them build something and then they go out and sell it to everybody."

That doesn't really make a lot of sense for me to completely take that step back, not have a solution that's available to me and then help them create a new system that they're going to go out and sell and we're not going to get any money for it or very limited money for it. They kept pushing that on me and I just had to keep pushing back that I'm just not interested. Anyway, that's all of them that we went through. I'm trying to remember. There may have been a couple of others, but they just didn't go very far in terms of conversation.

## Client
A quick question on Latent, you talked about what they did in prior authorization. To clarify, were they only focused on that or did they also do the benefits investigation?

## Expert
They help out with the benefits investigation. I'll still say that's a part of their solution that's not as developed, and I'll say in comparison to something like Plenful. That's why I said we were liking what we were hearing from Plenful and again, it's okay, but Plenful also did the benefits investigation and they were really high and able to push things a little bit more. They do do part of it. They certainly help out with benefits investigation as well.

## Client
That makes sense. How well-penetrated would you say these solutions are at health systems generally? What I mean by that question is, if you were getting started in building a company in this space today, would you be late in the game or is it wide open in a lot of health systems where they're still either establishing their specialty pharmacy and so they still don't have a vendor in place, or they are just now getting around to thinking about AI? Would you say actually the space has already been captured by a lot of these vendors, and you'd be trying to replace things that are already there versus starting from scratch a lot of systems?

## Expert
You're asking where you would try to slot in?

## Client
Yeah. That's the second part of the question. If you were entering here, what would be the first? Where are you seeing unmet need? Where none of these vendors can really solve anything, and where would you start? That's the second part of the question. The first part of the question is, how much of the market do you think has already been captured at health systems, when you talk to other chief pharmacy officer?

## Expert
Yeah, I don't think a lot of the market's been captured at all. If you look on Latent, they show maybe a dozen partners. I can't even remember. I don't even know if we're on it yet because we're still early in our partnership. I think they've got three health systems that they really boast a lot about. That's just because they've been in there and they're in it.

They're really able to show like, "Hey, this is the full benefit of the platform." If you look at Mandolin, they don't really have any health systems. They're still just in the for-profit infusion space. I think Plenful maybe had two. It's still really early. Have people maybe started making up their minds of like, "Hey, if I can do this, I want to go with X or Y." Some, but if you had a really strong entrant that came into the marketplace, you can go from there.

I think there's two really big things to consider when answering that question. One, again, I touched on it before, so I'm not going to belabor it. The IT bandwidth and how long it takes to get something up and running is huge. When you think about that in terms of switching costs, it's really hard. I've had people say, "What would it take for you to leave Latent and do something else?" I was like, "An act of God," because I had to fight tooth and nail just to get Latent in.

That's before we established that AI governing board. I said before, that's why we didn't want to say stop and pause and then compare it to Plenful. We're like, "Okay, now with this board in place, they could just completely stop everything." We couldn't sit there for another eight months for them to do an evaluation. That's a really big issue with switching and even trying to bring things on. It's tough.

The other aspect that's really important is that, I'm just going to say, the ego of chief pharmacy officers. Chief pharmacy officers have primarily focused on growth, just all about growth. It's about how much more revenue you bringing in, how many more FTEs you got. That is the way that we brag. That's the way we do our measuring contests of who's the best chief pharmacy officer is how many positions you have. These days it's like, how many positions you have vacant, because it's just showing how many FTEs you have in total?

To convince them that a really interesting thing to bring to your peers and talk about is actually the attrition of resources is a mind shift that I don't think a lot of chief pharmacy officers or directors of pharmacies or VPs of pharmacies, whatever it may be, are completely ready for. When I talked about that like, "Hey, I'm actually going to reduce the FTEs that I have focused on prior authorization by bringing in AI."

It was like, "What? Why would you do that? No, you don't want to let those FTEs go. You should just point them elsewhere." It's like, "Well, then how are you really getting efficiencies?" If your FTE costs are the same, and then now you're bringing on an expensive platform, or at least a platform that costs some money, then how are you really improving your margins?

Everyone's like, "Oh, it's just growth you're bringing." That's true, but could you improve your margin even further with true attrition resources? You could. It's probably seven figures, if you really look at it. I think that is a portion of it that is not widely accepted amongst chief pharmacy officers.

If a vendor came in and was like, "Well, hey, I think this is a big part of the value proposition is a reduction in force." A CPO is not going to like that. You definitely don't want to go around the CPO and try to jump to the COO or CFO to say, "Hey. this is an opportunity because you'll get blackballed at that point in time and we'll all crucify you." That's a little bit the issue that's still out there.

## Client
Got it. If you were starting out as a new company focused on health systems, specialty pharmacy, which problem would you start tackling first, along that workflow that you described? My guess here, and I'd love your thoughts, is prior authorization. That's because I think there's a strong ROI case around both FTE efficiency, but then also revenue. At the front end of the revenue cycle process, making sure you get paid for that patient, I feel like that's where there's a lot of value.

As you mentioned, a lot of health systems still haven't implemented something here. My guess would be starting there and trying to compete against Latent, Plenful, and the others is probably the right place to start just because no one's really captured the whole market yet. I'd love your thoughts on that. You could say to me, actually I would focus on something that's easier to implement like, I don't know 340B compliance, and then you work backwards from there. Where would you start if you were starting out selling these types of solutions?

## Expert
Yeah. I think you could do either/or. To be completely honest with you, the other piece that we didn't talk about is the elephant in the room, which is Epic. Epic is going to go into this space sooner or later. I know a lot of the guys from Epic and have worked with them very closely because again, I continue to say, "Hey, I want one person to do it all."

When AI vendors do not want to do that, I didn't stop there. I took that idea to Epic and we had a whole forum with other chief pharmacy officers really pressing Epic on that with their pharmacy team, that this is a place that actually Epic should be the leader in. They're very early of understanding the problem, what solutions they could do.

They put a lot of resources into migrating everyone over to hyperspace. Now, they've got resource allocation that they can go back and to build out some solutions. I think as pharmacy leaders, we're trying to push them of, this is a big area because again, it's where we are starting to see other vendors playing in. They're asking for six, seven figures a year to do this work.

We again feel like, as our EMR, all the information's right in the EMR, they're literally pulling information out of EMR, putting it into the payer's portal, which again Epic has, through what they call payer portal. They're the other big like, "Oh, what could that look like in a couple of years?" Again, if you already have a solution embedded, then saying, "Well, hey, I'm going to now pivot to Epic is still not always easy to do and requires a lot of money a lot of time."

If I were a brand-new entrant into it, I would really be focusing on the optimization, especially pharmacy. I think that is a little bit more on the front end of 340B. What are your gaps in? Do you have leakage that's coming out? What are your other financial opportunities? That really sets up the narrative for investment. When I had to come to the table, it was, "Guys, we've got an extra $19 million a year in prescription being generated right here at our IDN, but we're not fully capturing it. 'Okay, why?' Well, our physicians don't give a shit. They're just letting these prescriptions go anywhere. What do you need?

"Well, I need technicians, I need pharmacists to be out there working with those physicians, working with the patients, making sure they're driving all of those prescriptions towards our pharmacies. Why can't you do that?' Well, they're spending a lot of time doing some of these administrative tasks, like prior authorization. 'Could you use those resources to do something else?' Yes, I could. I could redeploy them into the clinics, these taxi pharmacists. I need something that will help me automate away prior authorization. 'What is that?' Well, it's Latent.'"

That's literally how I brought Latent into the system. I think knowing that information of what's at stake and what's possible is actually something that a lot of chief pharmacy officers don't have. Actually, starting on that front end of we're going to help you from an analytics perspective, from an AI perspective to do a whole system evaluation of where your leakage is occurring, what that opportunity is, what's the margin on those opportunities that's out there.

All of that is something that sometimes we have to do manually to try to figure out. Based on this price and based on this contract and based on this payer, we think it would be about. You need to really solve that front-end issue for us so that we can come to the table and say, "Hey, my specialty pharmacy is worth $50 million annually and I'm only capturing $20 million of it because of these issues," and then build from there.

If you equip a chief pharmacy officer to be able to walk into the C-suite and just say that, they're going to love you and then you take that and say, "Okay, we can also help you reduce some of that administrative burden that we know you're plagued with, whether it's benefits investigation, prior authorization, patient assistance, some rev cycle management, whatever it may be."

You start to then work along that pathway and be that true partner. I think that's what we all want. We want that true partner. That's just like, "Hey, I'm going to solve this whole issue with you. I'm going to make you be a rock star and together we're going to benefit. As we take on more for you, you're going to pay us more."

## Client
That makes sense. A quick follow-up on that. On the analytics side, how much do you think a chief pharmacy officer would pay a vendor if they could do what you're describing? There are three parts. How much do you think they'd pay for it to be done? The second part is what vendors are already doing it and do they fall short in being able to do all this stuff? The third is how long do you think a vendor could implement this type of thing? Is this just about consolidating all the information you have and being able to run AI analytics over it? Is that months, weeks?

## Expert
Yeah. I don't think any vendor does it. Anybody does it right now. A lot of that's just even just having a full arms around leakage is not something that you can easily get from Epic. It's not something you can easily get from any vendor. No one's really, really doing it right now. It's still very manual. You got to have MSOT built out within Epic, Willow Ambulatory.

You have to have certain functionalities built. You have to make sure everybody's on the same platform. Everybody's on the same Epic. That's the variability that's out there is that not everyone's even set up, even if you're just an Epic person. Everyone's not even set up the same way to be able to get to that level of information. To me, I think that needs to be a constant, active dashboard.

I need to be able to say, "Hey, today, how much money left my health system and was prescribed somewhere else?" A live like, "Hey, I'm dumping in data every single day," and every single day I'm able to come and say, "Hey, this is my margin opportunity that went out the door," and really say that from a high-level perspective of like, "Hey, we got four hospitals. I want to be able to assess that down to each hospital." For each hospital, when we have patients being discharged, what percentage of their medications didn't come to one of our pharmacies and how much margin?

## Client
I'm sorry to interrupt. I will have to jump to another call right now, but one last question is, if you could do all of what you're describing, how much do you think a health system, a chief pharmacy officer would pay for that?

## Expert
I think we're in that space of probably maybe $400,00, $500,000 just to start, just for that analytics. Just for that low of analytics of being able to give me that up-to-date anytime I look into it to check in, to be able to, again, maybe look at it by specialty, look at a provider, by area, by hospital, all those kinds of things. That's worth its weight in gold.

## Client
Got it. Awesome. Thank you again for taking the time to speak with me today. This was very helpful. Enjoy the rest of your day.
