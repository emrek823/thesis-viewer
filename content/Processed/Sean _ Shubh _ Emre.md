### Fundraising Progress & Market Reception

- Healthcare data space has fundamentally changed since last raise
	- No longer questioning market size - now asking “how do we quantify it?”
	- Reed (previously skeptical): “healthcare data space has just changed, it’s much more important”
	- Clear there will be 1-2 winners in this space
- Casting wide net with strong reception
	- Everyone wants to meet
	- People getting the product/narrative better than previous rounds
- Key investor feedback patterns:
	- Sapphire, Reed, Brittany from CRV no longer questioning market viability
	- B Capital and others showing appreciation for core real-world data (RWD)
	- Market awareness increased (Veracyte reaching $10B valuation helps positioning)

### Product Positioning & Competitive Dynamics

- Alley-oop positioning working well:
	- Privacy agent handles all privacy/compliance work
	- Data agent manages end-to-end data logistics
	- Replaces compliance consultants plus data engineers
- Protege vs. Integral discussion points:
	- “If we have all the same data” - hinting at potential disintermediation
	- Not core commercial motion today but investors can read between lines
	- Partnership revenue represents roughly half of current revenue
- Agentic rebuild investment ($4-5M from last round):
	- Leveraged power law data assets already under management
	- Seamlessly incorporates new data modalities (voice, genomics, unstructured notes)
	- Voice represents next $10M spend opportunity from AI companies
	- Prevents recreating infrastructure for each new modality

### Growth Projections & Insight Meeting Prep

- 2024 projections: End at 9 (confidently believe), investors likely discount to 8
- 2025 targets: 30-31 total revenue
	- 2x expansion on current revenue base (16 from existing)
	- Additional 16 from new business (AE ramp, Purple Lab expansion, LiveRamp expansion)
	- Enterprise accounts could expand 4-5x vs. current
- Data providers “barbelling” due to AI gold rush:
	- Scaling up supply to capture OpenAI data spend
	- Need compliant, surgical data set optimization
	- Seven-figure contracts on provider side leading to purchaser contracts
- Insight meeting approach:
	- Alex is contact (not Alan), plus Spiro and Richard (MD)
	- No specific watch-outs needed
	- Standard narrative: iterations/evolution while building same vision
	- Compliance wedge → continuous monitoring → Integral intelligence
	- Goal: shift spend from LiveRamp/Snowflake to Integral
