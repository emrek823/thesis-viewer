### Background & Experience

- Shane has 15-20 years experience building ML/AI products, starting in grad school with Andrew Ng
- Career progression:
	- PowerSets (acquired by Microsoft) - worked on natural language search for Bing
	- Netflix
	- Founded company acquired by Glimpse, later acquired by Apple Healthcare
	- Shutterstock
	- Zoom (chain company, pre-COVID)
	- GSK - worked with David Kim

### Nanner Origin Story at GSK

- Joined GSK 5 years ago
- Initial realization: traditional AI approach (variant-to-gene-to-function) wasn’t viable due to insufficient mechanism data
- Identified need to understand diseased vs healthy cell mechanisms at cellular level
- Evaluated competitors:
	- Recursion’s wide maps approach deemed insufficient
	- Developed active learning loop to reduce uncertainty through targeted assays
- Validated approach on:
	- Hepatocytes (studying cell ballooning)
	- T cells and immune cells
- Personal catalyst: Sister’s triple negative breast cancer diagnosis led to cancer focus

### Technical Approach & IP

Core IP from GSK experience (~80% of current work):

- Data structuring methodologies
- Hypothesis development for experimental assays
- Models for predicting optimal assay selection
- Phenotyping assays development:
	- Rapid healthy/non-healthy cell identification
	- Integration of multi-omics, imaging, and staining
- Novel hypothesis generation constrained by LLM training data

### Active Learning Loop Process

Current cycle metrics:

- Traditional bio cycle: 12-18 months
- Nanner’s improved timeline: 3-18 weeks for cell growth and sequencing/imaging
- CD4 T-cells optimization:
	- Current: 10-12 weeks
	- Target: 6 weeks
- Automation capabilities:
	- Complete loop automation (except cell growth and imaging/omics)
	- Parallel processing across CROs and internal labs
	- Scalable to thousands of experiments

### Commercialization Strategy

Two initial paths:

- Target Qualification

- 2-year timeline to qualification
- 4-month ramp-up per cell type
- Potential pharma partnerships (e.g., GSK) for fit-for-purpose data generation

- Data Asset Development

- Building comprehensive oncology dataset
- Investment in data partnerships (e.g., Tempus)
- Focus on developing valuable data assets for partnerships
- Revenue sharing opportunities through target qualification

### Timeline

- Actively starting conversations
- Planning aggressive fundraising end of summer/September
- Currently winding down GSK work
