### Fundraising Strategy & Timeline

- Working with Finn’s platform team (Graham) on storytelling and deck development
	- Platform team access without additional equity cost
	- Graham has 5 years at GGV, specializes in helping companies raise
	- Full-time CFO hired: Mark Temple
- Fundraising timeline: Start October 27th, complete within 3 weeks of meetings
	- VIP introductions first: Finn introducing to Pat Grady and others
	- Goal: 5M ARR live by end of month, targeting 6.5M by year-end
	- Raising $25M (ideally $35M) with minimal dilution plus secondary

### Market Narrative Evolution

- Shifted from healthcare-focused to broader data infrastructure play
	- Legacy industries (60-70% of business) buying more due to AI wave
	- New customers: OpenAI, Meta, Microsoft, CPG, retail companies
	- 23andMe first-time data monetization through Integral platform
- Market positioning: Centralized compliant data infrastructure for AI/healthcare
	- $30B annual healthcare data market
	- Foundational models becoming $5-10M customers within 2 years
	- Margin for error too low in healthcare to switch providers

### Investor Feedback & Concerns

- Lightspeed (Brenton): Questioned why Flatiron would use Integral
	- Response: Even if Flatiron uses only compliance agent, enables faster data sales to buyers like AbbVie
- General skepticism around foundational model spending sustainability
- Key narrative: Healthcare going agentic requires centralized, compliant data infrastructure
- Competitive advantage: Data and compliance lock-in - switching shuts down entire data flow

### Growth Trajectory & Expansion

- Current metrics: 1M to 6M ARR growth demonstrated
- Path to 100M+ ARR unclear to investors currently
- Foundational models <20% of business despite spotlight
- Platform consolidation play: All data brokers must use Integral for compliance to serve AI labs
- Expansion beyond consultants to direct enterprise data infrastructure
