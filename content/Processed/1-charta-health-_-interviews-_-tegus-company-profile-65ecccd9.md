**Client**
Hi. Thanks for taking the time to talk with me. I am interested in learning more about healthcare AI companies that have cropped up doing stuff around scribing or coding or revenue cycle management. It's been a little difficult to figure out what all these companies do, to be honest, just from the websites.

It looks like maybe you guys use Charta Health and maybe you used to use Adonis. One, what do you guys actually do? That would be helpful just to start. Just curious. It seems like maybe you use Charta Health. Maybe just walk me through where in the medical journey you've used different AI solutions and which ones have been good, which ones haven't, would be just helpful as we try to get feedback on these to see which ones we should try to go talk to.

**Expert**
I'll give you a little bit of background myself, and then I'll ask you a question so that we can lead into the correct responses. Obviously, director of IT at a Texas Medical Center. We have inpatient services, we have outpatient services. Within the structure, we're 120-bed facility. We have seven outpatient clinics at different multi-specialty. We have a pretty robust revenue cycle team on the inpatient side as well as on the outpatient side. We have a pretty rigid IT structure that we facilitate to both inpatient and outpatient.

We have a corporate structure. Now, within the corporate structure, we report to, obviously, the higher hierarchy body. However, in the health system, we have six hospitals, all in the state of Texas. We have one in Colorado. Each one of these have inpatient and outpatient services. They're not all the same size. Some of them are bigger than us, some of them are smaller than us. We're right in that middle with that 120-bed hospital. That's where we stand and a little bit about my company and myself.

Now, as far as AI solutions go, the biggest question comes around, what is the focus for each facility? The focus for our facility was we had a very broken revenue cycle management solution, which was Change Healthcare. We went from Change Healthcare and then went over to Adonis. Tried Adonis on the outpatient side. There's only so much AI is going to be able to do, and then you basically hit your cap. You're like, "Okay. Well, I can optimize my charges, I can optimize my denials, I can optimize my prior authorization and benefits verification. I can run it through all the different areas and all the different multi-specialties that we have," but you're going to hit that ceiling.

Once you hit that ceiling, what do you do next? Now there's no more room for improvement. That's what happened to us with Adonis. That's where we're like, "Okay. Well, we're done with Adonis. Let's just bring in a new solution and see if there is more room. Can we make more money?"

The problem we run into with it being an acute care facility is the finances are very focused on, where can we make sure internally that the processes that the clinical staff are doing and the registration staff are doing and the billing staff are doing, we're capturing 100% of our charges? We don't want to capture just 50% of our charges or 20% of our charges. We want to capture all 100%.

When we did this whole evaluation with Adonis, we identified, we're leaving almost about 50% on the table. They're like, "We can get you up to 100%." Sure, they got us up to 85%-86%. We were like, "What about the next 15%?" They're like, "No, you've optimized your solution. You've optimized everything in billing. We've gone through your CPT codes, we've gone through your chargemaster, we've gone through your additional addendum and charges that you could possibly have, and we just can't find anything."

We're like, "Okay. Well, I don't see us working with you anymore because you're not pushing the limit. You are the ones who identified you can capitalize on this 50% remaining." That's when we brought in Charta. Now, we brought in Charta. Has Charta closed the gap on that 15%? It's closed about 6% on it. We're still looking at a 9% room for growth and opportunity. The good thing is that it worked on the 6%.

**Client**
Just to understand, you're using Change Healthcare for your RCM solution.

**Expert**
Used to.

**Client**
Change Healthcare is an RCM company. You're outsourcing it to Change Healthcare. You moved to Adonis. They helped you capture 85% of charges properly. We can get more on Adonis, but when you move off Adonis, are you still able to capture that 85% without them or do you need them or how does that work?

**Expert**
No. I needed them to be able to capture that 35% more, get us to that 85%. We actually would not have been able to do it by ourselves internally because we tried. We tried for a good eight, nine months. We brought in more FTEs to say, "Hey, let's process this a little faster."

Here's the thing. The human element cannot review a batch of 500 charges or 500 claims going out. If you have an AI system, the AI system can review all those batch charges and say, "Hey, you have this particular claim that is going out," but you're not going to be able to do that, especially if it's going through a dual-layer audit. That's the value that Adonis adds, that's the value that Charta adds, is that AI component is solely focused on your charges and your claims that are going out. What does it ultimately do? Reduces your denials.

Before, our denial rate was about 12%, 13%. After implementing Adonis, the first six months, we dropped our denials to like 9%. Another 12 months later, we dropped our denials to less than 4%. We made a drastic improvement. I don't think we're ever going to get to 0% because there's just different variances in patient complexities.

There's a domino effect here. Doing a claims review, making sure your claims are clean, the byproduct is that you reduce your denial rates. We reduced ours to less than 4%. The byproduct of that is that the more clean claims going out, the more cleaner your charges and your payments are going to come back to you. The byproduct of that is that you get payment much faster. The byproduct of that, you have more days of cash on hand in your facility.

We planned days cash on hand from, I think it was like 40%, and now we're up over 60%. There's a reverse on the days cash on hand and the AR. Our AR was at 70%-something, almost 80%. Now our AR is over 25%. They go in the opposite directions.

**Client**
Got it. Maybe could you just walk through that? Adonis tops out at 85%. Do you still use Adonis, or can you get rid of Adonis and still achieve that 85%? That's what I was a little unclear on.

**Expert**
You're saying if we did not use Adonis, could we have.

**Client**
Do you guys still use Adonis and then you brought in Charta on top of that, or you got rid of Adonis? I was trying to follow that piece.

**Expert**
Yeah, rip and replace. We ripped out Adonis, and we brought in Charta.

**Client**
Got it. How big of an undertaking is that? How did you come to choose Charta? I'd be curious to hear about that whole process.

**Expert**
It was actually very painstaking. Our CFO knew that this was going to be a very rough ride and a rough process. It began with, obviously, making the decision that we're going to be moving away from Adonis. We gave them our notice. They did try to fight back and stay in and say, "Hey, we can continue. We'll reduce charges," etc. We're like, "No, that's fine. We're good."

Prior to that, the engagement had already started with Charta to say, "Hey, we need you to start integrating into our EMR system," which is actually athenahealth. They started integrating into athenahealth, and we started reviewing and testing in our staging environment. We did the review there. We tested everything in the testing environment, and then we went live. When we went live, it was a phased implementation. We did the family practice first, then we did the pediatrics, then we did the OB-GYN, then surgery clinic, and then orthopedic was last.

Once we did that phased approach, that's when we were able to really iron out each location at a time and address their particular issues. When we addressed it in that fashion, it went a little bit smoother, but we basically had to cut off each facility at a time. Each specialty had their own nuances, they had their own troubles. We addressed them, obviously, one at a time. The challenges were more so, "Hey, we integrated this information. We're running charges, we're losing money."

In the first 30 days, we were losing money because we're not capturing everything. Not all transactions are going through. AI is not applying it to all the charges and all the claims that were going out. There was, obviously, a little bit of leakage over there. The transition, even though it was phased, it was still a rocky ride.

**Client**
Got it. You are on Charta now. Maybe even just taking a step back because I'm relatively new to this whole ecosystem. What is Charta actually providing for you? Are they doing the medical coding and then following up on billing? It's always a little vague on these websites of what they're actually providing. What functionally is Charta providing to you in RCM?

**Expert**
Charta is actually providing us a solution that basically goes in and sits on top of our EMR solution. Now, what does it really do? Like a patient journey, when the patient comes in, chart is complete from the physician, they've done the physician notes, clinical notes. Once all that is complete, then it willy tap into the Charta platform. The Charta platform then says, "Hey, I'm looking at your billing batches," and out of the billing batch, it is being processed through the Charta platform. It is doing a deep-dive analysis on all these 500 claims.

Once it does that, it does the review. It comes back and gives you a report saying, "Okay, we found these 10 to be irregularities, and these 10 claims are probably going to have a denial rate." It's going to pinpoint to you exactly why you're going to have a denial on that.

Now, the biggest question in the room here is, how does it do that? There's an AI platform on the Charta environment that is built on rules. You're providing it a rule that says, "Hey, if there's a patient that came in for a follow-up or a checkup on their nine-month pregnancy, then this is what the codes should be." If there's one additional code in there, it's going to flag it and it's going to drop it into a different queue.

That flag is only happening because the AI has a rule built into it. If I don't build the rule in there, it is not going to flag anything. Entirely, it's rule-based. That's how the Charta system works. It's like a pre-visit, post-bill. It's doing the analysis on the coding as well.

**Client**
Got it. Some other coding AI companies are like Nym, Fathom, I guess Optum. Is Charta providing that function as well? I'm just trying to understand Charta relative to those companies if you're familiar with them.

**Expert**
I am. I'm actually familiar with Nym because Nym does so much on the coding aspect of it. Here's the distinction. The Nym platform is looking at it at the coding layer. The Charta platform is looking at it post-coding. It's looking at the claim. How do you get a claim? You get a claim once the whole chart is complete, once coding is complete, everything is complete. One is pre, one is post.

I'm glad you brought that up because those are the nuances between each one of these different solutions. Some say, "Hey, it's good to look at it at the coding layer." Fair, it's looking at it at the coding layer, but a coding layer is not going to tell you whether the claim is going to be denied or not.

**Client**
Got it. How is coding handled at your facilities today?

**Expert**
The coding aspect of it is already done within the athena EMR system. It applies the codes automatically.

**Client**
Okay. Has that been pretty good, or would someone like Nym be helpful to you guys to help close this gap? Do you feel like you don't have a coding issue?

**Expert**
I wouldn't say we have a coding issue. That was optimized already.

**Client**
Got it. Charta, when they're reviewing all this, them finding charts that will be denied, what drives that? What are they actually finding? What are they actually looking at comparing to know that if a chart will get denied to fix it or not? What does that mean?

**Expert**
Great question. The example that I provided, a patient comes in for that nine-month pregnancy follow-up. When the follow-up is complete, the physician is going to go in and say, "Hey, I ordered this test, I ordered that test. These are the kind of procedures that we're going to go through during pregnancy. This is what the nurse gave, this is what the nurse tested, and these are the steps that we follow today." There's a lengthy summary of procedures that were conducted on that particular patient.

Everything that is conducted to that patient is now going to go through as a chart review. There's a code applied to each one of those things. Let's say the physician ordered a CBC, CMP on that particular patient.

There is going to be a charge code attached to that. Let's just say the physician took the vitals and then took the weight. There's a charge code attached to that. Let's just say the physician ordered an X-ray. God, she ordered it, put the code in there. Now that whole complete chart is actually going to go for review.

Once it goes into review into the Charta system, once the chart is complete, the claim is complete, and it goes to the Charta system, the Charta system is automatically going to flag and say, "Hey, you cannot do an XR on a nine-month-old pregnant woman. This code that is attached to it is not going to be applicable. Your entire claim is going to be denied." That's what Charta does. It does the analysis and it identifies this particular code in there saying, "Hey, these are not procedural protocols. These are not in alignment with the care that you're providing." That's the reason why that system will push it out.

**Client**
In that example, has the care already been provided that shouldn't have been? What happens when they find issues?

**Expert**
It actually flags it, and then puts it in a different work list. We have review techs that are going in there. The review techs look at that and says, "Hey, okay. Well, why has it been denied? What is the possibility? What is being flagged?" It's going to tell you that, "Okay. Well, you have an order for an X-ray here." When you have that, what the review tech does is the review tech removes that and then puts it back in the queue for reprocessing.

Now, that has to be processed that same night. When they run it for reviewing for reprocessing, then it's running through the analysis again. The analysis passes, then it's good to go. Basically, it's looking for the revenue integrity is what it's called.

**Client**
Cool. I think I got it. What is Charta doing better that's helped narrow that gap that Adonis was topping out at?

**Expert**
I'll be very honest with you. It wasn't in all the different areas. I felt like with orthopedic, with pediatrics, with family practice, those three areas, it definitely looked at it 100%. Adonis was able to capitalize on those 100%. OB-GYN, general surgery, and ENT, those three areas, no, it was not able to. There was still room for improvement. That's where they were able to identify, "Hey, you're running XYZ CPT codes, you're running these particular charges and these fees. You're not going to be able to capture all those charges on that."

Surprisingly enough, with the Adonis system, it would go through and it would process and we would get the reimbursement for it. When we put Charta, Charta said, "No, you're not going to be able to claim for return on this. We were like, "Okay. Well, what's the right system? We're running it, but what's the anomaly here?" They bring in their compliance team, and their compliance team is reviewing all the different charge masters and the charge codes that we're applying in the system.

They're like, "Yeah, you can't apply this. That's not normal practice." That's how we were able to identify that, okay, there is room for improvement. They're looking at it as a whole chart. They're not looking at just the CPT codes, they're looking at the summary, they're looking at the follow-up, they're looking at the nurses' notes.

For example, our reference that came to our facility, the physician requested a few follow-up tests to be conducted. From this referral and that claim goes to get processed, the AI system is automatically going to flag it and say, "Hey, you're more than likely not going to be reimbursed for this." Why? Because the payer has already paid for this particular test that you're requesting for within the last 30 days. Now, this is a process reaching out to the payer and cross-comparing it with what we're ordering. It's not just looking at it on the internal pipeline, it's also looking at it from the external pipeline. Does that make sense?

**Client**
I think so. Has this replaced other headcount that were previously doing some of this chart review or outsourced? How do we think about that?

**Expert**
I was wondering when you were going to ask me that. The outpatient services that we have, we call it an RHC, rural health clinic. They're all covering all these seven facilities, seven sites. Covering the seven sites, each one of them used to have two individuals at each facility handling their revenue cycles, scheduling, appointments, follow-ups, and all those kinds of things.

Those 14 employees, we actually decided, while we had Adonis, that we're going to create a central billing coordination office. When we created a central billing coordination office, we consolidated to 10 FTEs. This is while we were on Adonis. We consolidated those 10 to four. Now you're talking about four FTEs that are managing seven sites.

How can this be possible? It's possible because now they don't have to look at pediatrics, they don't have to look at family practice, they don't have to look at orthopedic. Why? The AI system is already doing that for them. It's fully optimized. They just have to go in there and review at the end of the day. If something has failed and why it's failed, fix that and get it going again. You don't have to do that follow-up, you don't have to do that engagement, you don't have to do all that piece. That's already handled.

Yes, Adonis did assess that and bring it down to four FTEs. We have not moved from that. Even though we have Charta, and even though Charta is still capitalizing on everything, we don't feel comfortable to bring it down to maybe one or two FTEs. We still feel like there's a need for a human element to go in there and review everything that is going through the transactions through Charta.

**Client**
Makes sense. How much roughly does your healthcare system spend on Adonis or Charta?

**Expert**
I can't give you an exact number, but I can give you an idea. One FTE, for example, was between $40,000-$50,000. When we got to 10 FTEs, we were already making profits. Think about it as it's costing less than two FTEs combined.

**Client**
Got it. It's probably somewhere between $60,000-$80,000 a year is my hunch?

**Expert**
Somewhere in the park, yes.

**Client**
Got you. We've seen other AI tools that have entered the market. People are using, doing different functions, some of the taking notes, medical scribe-type stuff during the doctor visits or create prior authorization and stuff. I don't know whether there are other AI tools you use for different functions that are worth noting.

**Expert**
We do have Nuance, which is a scribing solution. We only use it in one particular space at the moment, and that is in family practice. Why? Because it's easier to get it tailored and customized to the physician and review what is being discussed.

I think a perfect way for me to describe that is if a patient comes in for a cold or a knee pain or ear pain, those are the things that the scribe can listen in on and summarize for you. When you start getting into the pediatrics, the OB-GYN, the orthopedic, it starts getting a little complex. It doesn't exactly capture everything. It can. There's been proven studies and stuff out there that those things should work, but it's just not. That's the reason why we only use it in the family practice environment.

There's only dedicated rooms to that. The thing that has to happen is you have to have the patient's consent saying, "Hey, we're going to put you in this room that we're using AI tools, and it's going to record our conversation, and then it's going to summarize it at the end." We have two rooms set up in the family practice environment with a Nuance DAX.

When the patient goes in, starts communicating with the physician, and they start talking, "Yeah, did you watch that football game? Look at the scores. Yeah, that touchdown," etc. The AI system, it's automatically going to omit all that. The minute the physician says, "Well, how can I help you today? Where's your pain today?" They're like, "Oh, it's here." The physician would say, "Okay, left knee quadrant. What's your severity of pain on a scale of 1-10?" They'll say, "About 10." "Okay. Well, you're really in pain then." It takes all those things down.

Now, let's say the physician says, "Well, I'm going to prescribe you for loratadine," or whatever medication it is. "I'm going to put you on this medication, and I'm going to put it in order, and then I want you to come back in about two weeks and see how you're feeling." What ends up happening with that AI system is that, people don't know this, but there is a human element that once everything is compiled by AI, there's an agent on that Nuance side that is actually reviewing everything. It's a matter of seconds. They're reviewing it within seconds, and then pushing it into the physician's queue.

Once it comes to the physician's queue, within one minute, he has the ability to review everything that has been ordered and everything that was discussed, summarized. "Hey, these are the orders. These were the assessments that were done. This was the triage that was done. These are the post-procedures that we're looking at. This is the next follow-up schedule for this particular patient." He just basically have some glance through it and sign off on it, knowing that there's no modifications to make. If there's any modifications to make, he can do that on the fly.

**Client**
Understood. I'm curious on something like Adonis, when you go to Charta, were there other companies that you evaluated? I think a few of the other names are Camber, Candid. Again, it's tough from the outside for me to know what these guys do. Are those all similar to Adonis and Charta? I'm trying to understand at least from someone in the space.

**Expert**
They're a little bit different. They're not exactly the same. Adonis, we already know what they do. Candid is more so on the revenue cycle side of things. If you want to really put it on your finances and you want to put a solution that is going to do analytics and it's going to look at all your transactions that are going through, payers, payer routing, Candid is going to do that for you. It's a combination of Adonis and Charta. That's what Candid is.

Nym, like we talked about, that's more concentrated on medical coding side of things. It's a little bit different how they approach it. They approach it before it actually gets to anything. Camber, there's really not too much information on Camber, but Camber is looking at it on the revenue cycle side of things as well. You need to understand that Camber looks at it on the front end and the middle, not so much on the back end of a revenue cycle. The benefits verification, insurance verification, they're doing cross-checks over there. When it goes to the middle, which is the coding and the billing, that's where it does the analysis on there, but nothing on the back end.

For example, let's just say a payment came in for a patient on a commercial and they had a secondary and a tertiary. processes that secondary. There is no analysis that is being conducted. It's only doing it for the first transaction. A few differences over there with Camber.

**Client**
Is there one approach that Candid and Camber not fits versus Charta? I'm trying to understand whether one of these companies is taking the best approach or super differentiated. Just curious, is Charta the one who's taking the best approach to this market, or is it different things? That's the thing I'm struggling a bit with all these. They'll do. What's the right answer? Maybe there's not one. Especially with the Camber, Candid, Charta, do you think one is best positioned to be successful?

**Expert**
There isn't really one solution that I'm going to say, "Oh, hey, this particular vendor product does everything. They're the best. They should be the market leader." It's not like Epic. "Oh, Epic does everything, so go get Epic." This particular place is very fragmented. Each one of them, for example, Camber, Adonis, Candid, Nym, they're all doing a revenue cycle function. They're all doing it at different layers of their revenue cycle. Some are doing it coding, some are doing it post-billing. The AI solution that they're using is very different as well.

What ends up happening is that each organization needs to go in there and evaluate these and pilot them and test it with their live data, and run it through the system and be like, "Hey, okay. Well, how much room do I have for improvement? What is your system finding?" It's going to go by what is the need for each organization. What particular aspect are they trying to address?

If I was in a position that felt like, "Man, my coding is off the charts, there's something wrong. I really need to put a grasp on this," that's when I would go to Nym and be like, "Hey, I need you to come in for about two years, three years, and then do a full deep analysis and clean up my system from a coding perspective." That's where I would hire coding.

If I know that my athena is already doing that, and I know that my finance is a problem, the billing, then I'm going to go there and look at Charta or Adonis and be like, "Hey, I need you to come in and do this analysis for me." It's all driven by the need. If you want to drive a fast car, go get a McLaren. You know that?

**Client**
Thank you for taking the time to speak with me. Have a nice day.
