*We’ve each been on our own respective journeys to accelerate the diffusion of AI across critical industries: Hemant, leading early investments in and cofounding category-defining companies that strengthen global resilience through applied AI; Hirsh, as a leader in enterprise transformations across government and healthcare while at Palantir. Together with an incredible team, we are building Percepta to more directly fuel the innovation and adoption of AI.*

\*\*\*\*

Enterprises around the world recognize that AI will fundamentally reshape their worlds, but most struggle to move beyond pilots and prototypes. Despite billions in enterprise spending on AI solutions, the gap between what’s possible and what’s actually happening is still too wide.

That’s why we’ve built [Percepta](https://percepta.ai/), a new General Catalyst Transformation Company, to help enterprises in critical industries harness the frontier of AI.

## **What We’re Solving**

GC has invested billions in AI infrastructure, applications, and partnerships. We’ve seen firsthand how AI can transform industries from healthcare to finance to manufacturing, when it’s applied at the core of how businesses work.

But too often, enterprises are still trying to bolt AI onto legacy infrastructure and processes. That approach leaves enterprises in the paralysis of prototypes, neither unlocking short-term gains nor future-proofing them for the ever-growing potential of AI. The future is AI-native operations, where humans and intelligent systems work side by side to redesign business processes from the ground up.

## **Our Approach**

Percepta is our answer to this challenge: deploying a world-class team of researchers, engineers, and product managers directly within enterprises. Percepta is enabled by products from across GC’s portfolio and beyond, and leverages their own Mosaic platform to orchestrate enterprise transformation.

As we've [written before](https://www.generalcatalyst.com/stories/business-transformation-with-applied-ai), business transformation with AI relies on three critical components: advancing the intelligence and foundational model layer, building the underlying data infrastructure, and enabling the workforce to adopt AI so teams and agents can work together. Percepta helps synchronize all three of these pillars.

To advance the intelligence layer, crucial to business transformation, Athul Paul Jacob and Costis Daskalakis are leading a frontier research lab to pursue advanced model building and decision-making capability across industries. This involves a blend of foundation models, reinforcement learning, optimization and game theory.

Percepta is powered by strategic partnerships with AWS and Anthropic, which provide scale, early access to frontier technology, and a degree of enterprise readiness to Percepta’s customers on day 1. These partnerships are fueled by shared purpose.

As Kate Jensen, Head of Americas at Anthropic, put it, "We’re excited to work with Percepta’s exceptional team to accelerate enterprise transformation through the adoption of AI. Percepta’s differentiated approach to building solutions with customers will help businesses across several industries incorporate Claude into critical workflows.”

Percepta’s approach is playbook-driven. The orchestration of research, product, engineering, workforce, and strategy is complex, and we are taking on this complexity to design scalable industry-specific frameworks for transformation.

By bringing together these components, Percepta is able to re-imagine how the modern-day enterprises should function at their core. Our work is already bringing AI nativeness to critical industries: healthcare, financial services, manufacturing, and more.

## **Our Progress**

Over the last year, Percepta has been quietly at work, creating transformative outcomes for global Fortune 500 customers, state governments, and a big part of the US healthcare ecosystem. Some examples include:

* Modernizing fraud detection and customer experience in financial services, delivering significant efficiency and EBITDA uplift for banks
* Optimizing supply chains and driving more optimal resource allocation in publicly traded manufacturing entities, minimizing overstocking, and improving resilience to demand fluctuations
* Helping governments streamline licensing and permitting processes with AI to deliver faster, more efficient services
* Automating clinical workflows and improving patient engagement for healthcare customers across payers and providers

Through these engagements, Percepta has built differentiated playbooks for how to execute AI transformation of healthcare, manufacturing, financial services, and government. As Percepta grows over the next few years, we expect the team to become a leading transformation partner for companies and governments around the world.

## **The Builders**

We are joined by an exceptional founding team: Thomas Mathew, Athul Paul Jacob, Radha Jain, Michael Rochlin, and Costis Daskalakis, who have led engineering and research teams across Palantir, MIT, Meta FAIR, Google, Citadel, and more.

Around them is a team of 20+ engineers, product leaders, and researchers who are pioneering what it means to be an AI-native transformation company.

## **The momentum towards transformation**

At General Catalyst, we have always lived at the bleeding edge of both technology and company-building. We don’t just invest in the future; we build it alongside entrepreneurs. With Percepta, fully owned by General Catalyst, we’re bringing that same edge directly into the enterprise, turning our investments, partnerships, and learnings into enterprise-scale transformation.

This creates a powerful flywheel. Enterprises gain a trusted transformation partner who can help them become AI-native. Founders in the GC ecosystem can gain unprecedented distribution, real-world design partners, and direct intelligence on customer pain points through Percepta’s channels. As Percepta develops repeatable industry playbooks, adoption compounds and creates more scale and deeper transformation across sectors.

The age of AI transformation has begun. The question isn’t whether enterprises will become AI-native, but how quickly they can get there — and who will help them do it responsibly, systematically, and at scale.

We believe Percepta is that partner. And we couldn’t be more excited to build this future together.
