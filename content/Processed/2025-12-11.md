## Virtue / GPV Transaction - MOU
**Granola ID:** 057e6417-87f0-48f6-82db-802f59b11914
**Created:** 2025-12-11T21:00:21.136Z
**Updated:** 2025-12-11T22:16:55.583Z

### Background & Parallel Opportunities

- Sean shared significant context about parallel LP opportunity
	- Prospective LP (known from Ninja in 2002) verbally committed $20-30M for parallel fund on Fund 2
	- Meeting head of fund next week after their diligence process
	- Both GPV and parallel fund aware of each other for transparency
- GPV transaction moving faster than expected
- Early stage venture landscape changed significantly - need more resources/firepower to compete effectively
- Andrew Perlman (GPV co-founder) continuing as one of three GPs, others moving to emeritus status

### Deal Economics & Strategic Rationale

- Personal economics materially different - 2x vs 3x carry structure plus significant salary increase
- GPV bringing $1.5-1.6B AUM plus recent $150M raise
- Combined fund size would be ~$210M (GPV $155M + Virtue $55M)
- Strategic benefits for Virtue:
	- 20+ healthcare system relationships
	- 6-7 pharma partnerships
	- Multi-pronged investment + incubation strategy
	- Ability to save 1-2 fund cycles (5-7 years) by pulling forward opportunities

### MOU Key Terms Review

- Brand positioning: Virtue name secured for investment vehicles
	- Need clearer language that GPV branding phases out for investment activities
	- Future investment team members designated as Virtue team
- 50/50 NewCo management company structure confirmed
- Ratchet considerations regarding LP percentage of fund size (GPV side)
- Budget cross-fund allocation needs timeframe clarification
- LPs will need allocation policy among three funds

### Structural & Governance Issues

- Future/successor funds: all investment vehicles under Virtue, incubation under The Point
- Key Person Clause likely needs either/or structure so no LPs feel disadvantaged in merger
- Roles & responsibilities need clearer delineation:
	- Sean: full decision-making authority on Virtue investment side
	- Andrew: same authority on The Point incubation side
	- Fund-level decisions remain 50/50 with tiebreaker mechanisms needed
- Outside activities/exclusivity provisions need mirroring between parties

### Transaction Mechanics & Costs

- Expense provisions & merger fees allocation to be determined
- Virtue estimated costs: $50-100K (assuming MoFo not drafting significant documents)
- Side letters may need renegotiation between both funds
- Structure optionality important - current GPV proposals very GPV-favorable
- Need to prioritize easiest path for all LPs to obtain consent

### Timeline & Process

- Realistic timeline expectations:
- Holiday season creating calendar constraints
- Consent solicitation analysis needed to identify LP risks on both sides

### Next Steps

- Sean to call Andrew immediately regarding:
	- Alignment on structural optionality (ensure not wedded to specific GPV-favorable options)
	- Goal of finding easiest mechanics for all LPs
- MoFo to provide redlined MOU with key clarifications
- Sean to get compensation terms in writing for protection
- Both sides to review budget as mutually agreed, including compensation details
- Remove feeder fund option from MOU (less attractive than direct merger)

### MSK Pathology Model Results

- New model achieves state-of-the-art for predicting cancer outcomes
- Second blog post draft ready showcasing MSK collaboration
- Significant performance improvement over previous benchmarks
- Will become primary public offering to establish SMB as standard

### Academic Medical Center Strategy

- Partnering with AMCs provides validation that circles back to pharma
- Current partnerships: MSK, Yale, MD Anderson, UCSD
- Reducing onboarding time from several calls to 1 hour (Yale), targeting 2-3 minutes
- Goal: Make it “bad practice” not to fine-tune SMB’s model for AI in biomedicine
- Mayo clinic wants in-person meeting by year-end

### Pharma Business Development

- Sanofi POC already kicked off, expecting to close additional $4.8M by March/April (98% confidence)
- Meeting Ken Branson (GSK) next week
- IQVIA proposal submitted: $44M including compute, first milestone $1M
- Tempest meetings scheduled at JPM with Eric Lafkowski and Ryan Fukushima
- Meeting with various pharma companies showing interest but many still trying to build internally

### Foundation Model Vision

- Consolidating all modalities (genomics, radiology, pathology, longitudinal EHR) into single model
- Three size variants to be distributed
- Purchased 1M oncology CTs from Gradient for $150K (delivery Dec 29)
- Strategy: Force pharma to choose between expensive internal development vs licensing SMB model

### Fundraising Strategy

- Current runway: 10.9 months
- Not formally fundraising but open to raising earlier than later
- Prefer January raise to accelerate AMC partnerships and data licensing
- Two potential paths:

### JPM Investor Meetings

- Half business development, half investor meetings scheduled
- Meeting with: Lux, GV, Obvious, Pioneer, North Pond, Prudent
- Strategy: Share vision rather than hard pitch, filter for aligned investors
- Need to demonstrate team credibility beyond traditional “big tech” backgrounds

### Technical Progress Updates

- Pan-cancer genomics work with UCSD researcher (30 hours/week, unpaid)
- All modalities converging into unified standard model architecture
- Radiology chosen as key modality due to longitudinal standard-of-care nature
- Data delivery from Gradient expected Dec 29, one week training timeline

### Next Steps

- Kevin to send meeting schedule and teaser deck materials
- Create 10-slide teaser deck for JPM meetings
- Begin formal investor outreach for additional meetings
- Continue Sanofi contract finalization
- Finalize data processing pipeline for Gradient CTs

	- Need clearer language that GPV branding phases out for investment activities
	- Future investment team members designated as Virtue team
- 50/50 NewCo management company structure confirmed
- Ratchet considerations regarding LP percentage of fund size (GPV side)
- Budget cross-fund allocation needs timeframe clarification
- LPs will need allocation policy among three funds

### Structural & Governance Issues

- Future/successor funds: all investment vehicles under Virtue, incubation under The Point
- Key Person Clause likely needs either/or structure so no LPs feel disadvantaged in merger
- Roles & responsibilities need clearer delineation:
	- Sean: full decision-making authority on Virtue investment side
	- Andrew: same authority on The Point incubation side
	- Fund-level decisions remain 50/50 with tiebreaker mechanisms needed
- Outside activities/exclusivity provisions need mirroring between parties

### Transaction Mechanics & Costs

- Expense provisions & merger fees allocation to be determined
- Virtue estimated costs: $50-100K (assuming MoFo not drafting significant documents)
- Side letters may need renegotiation between both funds
- Structure optionality important - current GPV proposals very GPV-favorable
- Need to prioritize easiest path for all LPs to obtain consent

### Timeline & Process

- Realistic timeline expectations:
- Holiday season creating calendar constraints
- Consent solicitation analysis needed to identify LP risks on both sides

### Next Steps

- Sean to call Andrew immediately regarding:
	- Alignment on structural optionality (ensure not wedded to specific GPV-favorable options)
	- Goal of finding easiest mechanics for all LPs
- MoFo to provide redlined MOU with key clarifications
- Sean to get compensation terms in writing for protection
- Both sides to review budget as mutually agreed, including compensation details
- Remove feeder fund option from MOU (less attractive than direct merger)

### MSK Pathology Model Results

- New model achieves state-of-the-art for predicting cancer outcomes
- Second blog post draft ready showcasing MSK collaboration
- Significant performance improvement over previous benchmarks
- Will become primary public offering to establish SMB as standard

### Academic Medical Center Strategy

- Partnering with AMCs provides validation that circles back to pharma
- Current partnerships: MSK, Yale, MD Anderson, UCSD
- Reducing onboarding time from several calls to 1 hour (Yale), targeting 2-3 minutes
- Goal: Make it “bad practice” not to fine-tune SMB’s model for AI in biomedicine
- Mayo clinic wants in-person meeting by year-end

### Pharma Business Development

- Sanofi POC already kicked off, expecting to close additional $4.8M by March/April (98% confidence)
- Meeting Ken Branson (GSK) next week
- IQVIA proposal submitted: $44M including compute, first milestone $1M
- Tempest meetings scheduled at JPM with Eric Lafkowski and Ryan Fukushima
- Meeting with various pharma companies showing interest but many still trying to build internally

### Foundation Model Vision

- Consolidating all modalities (genomics, radiology, pathology, longitudinal EHR) into single model
- Three size variants to be distributed
- Purchased 1M oncology CTs from Gradient for $150K (delivery Dec 29)
- Strategy: Force pharma to choose between expensive internal development vs licensing SMB model

### Fundraising Strategy

- Current runway: 10.9 months
- Not formally fundraising but open to raising earlier than later
- Prefer January raise to accelerate AMC partnerships and data licensing
- Two potential paths:

### JPM Investor Meetings

- Half business development, half investor meetings scheduled
- Meeting with: Lux, GV, Obvious, Pioneer, North Pond, Prudent
- Strategy: Share vision rather than hard pitch, filter for aligned investors
- Need to demonstrate team credibility beyond traditional “big tech” backgrounds

### Technical Progress Updates

- Pan-cancer genomics work with UCSD researcher (30 hours/week, unpaid)
- All modalities converging into unified standard model architecture
- Radiology chosen as key modality due to longitudinal standard-of-care nature
- Data delivery from Gradient expected Dec 29, one week training timeline

### Next Steps

- Kevin to send meeting schedule and teaser deck materials
- Create 10-slide teaser deck for JPM meetings
- Begin formal investor outreach for additional meetings
- Continue Sanofi contract finalization
- Finalize data processing pipeline for Gradient CTs

## Virtue / GPV Transaction - MOU
**Granola ID:** 057e6417-87f0-48f6-82db-802f59b11914
**Created:** 2025-12-11T21:00:21.136Z
**Updated:** 2025-12-11T22:16:55.583Z

### Background & Parallel Opportunities

- Sean shared significant context about parallel LP opportunity
	- Prospective LP (known from Ninja in 2002) verbally committed $20-30M for parallel fund on Fund 2
	- Meeting head of fund next week after their diligence process
	- Both GPV and parallel fund aware of each other for transparency
- GPV transaction moving faster than expected
- Early stage venture landscape changed significantly - need more resources/firepower to compete effectively
- Andrew Perlman (GPV co-founder) continuing as one of three GPs, others moving to emeritus status

### Deal Economics & Strategic Rationale

- Personal economics materially different - 2x vs 3x carry structure plus significant salary increase
- GPV bringing $1.5-1.6B AUM plus recent $150M raise
- Combined fund size would be ~$210M (GPV $155M + Virtue $55M)
- Strategic benefits for Virtue:
	- 20+ healthcare system relationships
	- 6-7 pharma partnerships
	- Multi-pronged investment + incubation strategy
	- Ability to save 1-2 fund cycles (5-7 years) by pulling forward opportunities

### MSK Pathology Model Results

- New model achieves state-of-the-art for predicting cancer outcomes
- Second blog post draft ready showcasing MSK collaboration
- Significant performance improvement over previous benchmarks
- Will become primary public offering to establish SMB as standard

### Academic Medical Center Strategy

- Partnering with AMCs provides validation that circles back to pharma
- Current partnerships: MSK, Yale, MD Anderson, UCSD
- Reducing onboarding time from several calls to 1 hour (Yale), targeting 2-3 minutes
- Goal: Make it “bad practice” not to fine-tune SMB’s model for AI in biomedicine
- Mayo clinic wants in-person meeting by year-end

### Pharma Business Development

- Sanofi POC already kicked off, expecting to close additional $4.8M by March/April (98% confidence)
- Meeting Ken Branson (GSK) next week
- IQVIA proposal submitted: $44M including compute, first milestone $1M
- Tempest meetings scheduled at JPM with Eric Lafkowski and Ryan Fukushima
- Meeting with various pharma companies showing interest but many still trying to build internally

### Foundation Model Vision

- Consolidating all modalities (genomics, radiology, pathology, longitudinal EHR) into single model
- Three size variants to be distributed
- Purchased 1M oncology CTs from Gradient for $150K (delivery Dec 29)
- Strategy: Force pharma to choose between expensive internal development vs licensing SMB model

### Fundraising Strategy

- Current runway: 10.9 months
- Not formally fundraising but open to raising earlier than later
- Prefer January raise to accelerate AMC partnerships and data licensing
- Two potential paths:

### JPM Investor Meetings

- Half business development, half investor meetings scheduled
- Meeting with: Lux, GV, Obvious, Pioneer, North Pond, Prudent
- Strategy: Share vision rather than hard pitch, filter for aligned investors
- Need to demonstrate team credibility beyond traditional “big tech” backgrounds

### Technical Progress Updates

- Pan-cancer genomics work with UCSD researcher (30 hours/week, unpaid)
- All modalities converging into unified standard model architecture
- Radiology chosen as key modality due to longitudinal standard-of-care nature
- Data delivery from Gradient expected Dec 29, one week training timeline

### Next Steps

- Kevin to send meeting schedule and teaser deck materials
- Create 10-slide teaser deck for JPM meetings
- Begin formal investor outreach for additional meetings
- Continue Sanofi contract finalization
- Finalize data processing pipeline for Gradient CTs

## Virtue / GPV Transaction - MOU
**Granola ID:** 057e6417-87f0-48f6-82db-802f59b11914
**Created:** 2025-12-11T21:00:21.136Z
**Updated:** 2025-12-11T22:16:55.583Z

### Background & Parallel Opportunities

- Sean shared significant context about parallel LP opportunity
	- Prospective LP (known from Ninja in 2002) verbally committed $20-30M for parallel fund on Fund 2
	- Meeting head of fund next week after their diligence process
	- Both GPV and parallel fund aware of each other for transparency
- GPV transaction moving faster than expected
- Early stage venture landscape changed significantly - need more resources/firepower to compete effectively
- Andrew Perlman (GPV co-founder) continuing as one of three GPs, others moving to emeritus status

### Deal Economics & Strategic Rationale

- Personal economics materially different - 2x vs 3x carry structure plus significant salary increase
- GPV bringing $1.5-1.6B AUM plus recent $150M raise
- Combined fund size would be ~$210M (GPV $155M + Virtue $55M)
- Strategic benefits for Virtue:
	- 20+ healthcare system relationships
	- 6-7 pharma partnerships
	- Multi-pronged investment + incubation strategy
	- Ability to save 1-2 fund cycles (5-7 years) by pulling forward opportunities

### MOU Key Terms Review

- Brand positioning: Virtue name secured for investment vehicles
	- Need clearer language that GPV branding phases out for investment activities
	- Future investment team members designated as Virtue team
- 50/50 NewCo management company structure confirmed
- Ratchet considerations regarding LP percentage of fund size (GPV side)
- Budget cross-fund allocation needs timeframe clarification
- LPs will need allocation policy among three funds

### Structural & Governance Issues

- Future/successor funds: all investment vehicles under Virtue, incubation under The Point
- Key Person Clause likely needs either/or structure so no LPs feel disadvantaged in merger
- Roles & responsibilities need clearer delineation:
	- Sean: full decision-making authority on Virtue investment side
	- Andrew: same authority on The Point incubation side
	- Fund-level decisions remain 50/50 with tiebreaker mechanisms needed
- Outside activities/exclusivity provisions need mirroring between parties

### Transaction Mechanics & Costs

- Expense provisions & merger fees allocation to be determined
- Virtue estimated costs: $50-100K (assuming MoFo not drafting significant documents)
- Side letters may need renegotiation between both funds
- Structure optionality important - current GPV proposals very GPV-favorable
- Need to prioritize easiest path for all LPs to obtain consent

### Timeline & Process

- Realistic timeline expectations:
- Holiday season creating calendar constraints
- Consent solicitation analysis needed to identify LP risks on both sides

### Next Steps

- Sean to call Andrew immediately regarding:
	- Alignment on structural optionality (ensure not wedded to specific GPV-favorable options)
	- Goal of finding easiest mechanics for all LPs
- MoFo to provide redlined MOU with key clarifications
- Sean to get compensation terms in writing for protection
- Both sides to review budget as mutually agreed, including compensation details
- Remove feeder fund option from MOU (less attractive than direct merger)

### MSK Pathology Model Results

- New model achieves state-of-the-art for predicting cancer outcomes
- Second blog post draft ready showcasing MSK collaboration
- Significant performance improvement over previous benchmarks
- Will become primary public offering to establish SMB as standard

### Academic Medical Center Strategy

- Partnering with AMCs provides validation that circles back to pharma
- Current partnerships: MSK, Yale, MD Anderson, UCSD
- Reducing onboarding time from several calls to 1 hour (Yale), targeting 2-3 minutes
- Goal: Make it “bad practice” not to fine-tune SMB’s model for AI in biomedicine
- Mayo clinic wants in-person meeting by year-end

### Pharma Business Development

- Sanofi POC already kicked off, expecting to close additional $4.8M by March/April (98% confidence)
- Meeting Ken Branson (GSK) next week
- IQVIA proposal submitted: $44M including compute, first milestone $1M
- Tempest meetings scheduled at JPM with Eric Lafkowski and Ryan Fukushima
- Meeting with various pharma companies showing interest but many still trying to build internally

### Foundation Model Vision

- Consolidating all modalities (genomics, radiology, pathology, longitudinal EHR) into single model
- Three size variants to be distributed
- Purchased 1M oncology CTs from Gradient for $150K (delivery Dec 29)
- Strategy: Force pharma to choose between expensive internal development vs licensing SMB model

### Fundraising Strategy

- Current runway: 10.9 months
- Not formally fundraising but open to raising earlier than later
- Prefer January raise to accelerate AMC partnerships and data licensing
- Two potential paths:

### JPM Investor Meetings

- Half business development, half investor meetings scheduled
- Meeting with: Lux, GV, Obvious, Pioneer, North Pond, Prudent
- Strategy: Share vision rather than hard pitch, filter for aligned investors
- Need to demonstrate team credibility beyond traditional “big tech” backgrounds

### Technical Progress Updates

- Pan-cancer genomics work with UCSD researcher (30 hours/week, unpaid)
- All modalities converging into unified standard model architecture
- Radiology chosen as key modality due to longitudinal standard-of-care nature
- Data delivery from Gradient expected Dec 29, one week training timeline

### Next Steps

- Kevin to send meeting schedule and teaser deck materials
- Create 10-slide teaser deck for JPM meetings
- Begin formal investor outreach for additional meetings
- Continue Sanofi contract finalization
- Finalize data processing pipeline for Gradient CTs

## Virtue / GPV Transaction - MOU
**Granola ID:** 057e6417-87f0-48f6-82db-802f59b11914
**Created:** 2025-12-11T21:00:21.136Z
**Updated:** 2025-12-11T22:16:55.583Z

### Background & Parallel Opportunities

- Sean shared significant context about parallel LP opportunity
	- Prospective LP (known from Ninja in 2002) verbally committed $20-30M for parallel fund on Fund 2
	- Meeting head of fund next week after their diligence process
	- Both GPV and parallel fund aware of each other for transparency
- GPV transaction moving faster than expected
- Early stage venture landscape changed significantly - need more resources/firepower to compete effectively
- Andrew Perlman (GPV co-founder) continuing as one of three GPs, others moving to emeritus status

### Deal Economics & Strategic Rationale

- Personal economics materially different - 2x vs 3x carry structure plus significant salary increase
- GPV bringing $1.5-1.6B AUM plus recent $150M raise
- Combined fund size would be ~$210M (GPV $155M + Virtue $55M)
- Strategic benefits for Virtue:
	- 20+ healthcare system relationships
	- 6-7 pharma partnerships
	- Multi-pronged investment + incubation strategy
	- Ability to save 1-2 fund cycles (5-7 years) by pulling forward opportunities

### MOU Key Terms Review

- Brand positioning: Virtue name secured for investment vehicles
	- Need clearer language that GPV branding phases out for investment activities
	- Future investment team members designated as Virtue team
- 50/50 NewCo management company structure confirmed
- Ratchet considerations regarding LP percentage of fund size (GPV side)
- Budget cross-fund allocation needs timeframe clarification
- LPs will need allocation policy among three funds

### Structural & Governance Issues

- Future/successor funds: all investment vehicles under Virtue, incubation under The Point
- Key Person Clause likely needs either/or structure so no LPs feel disadvantaged in merger
- Roles & responsibilities need clearer delineation:
	- Sean: full decision-making authority on Virtue investment side
	- Andrew: same authority on The Point incubation side
	- Fund-level decisions remain 50/50 with tiebreaker mechanisms needed
- Outside activities/exclusivity provisions need mirroring between parties

### Transaction Mechanics & Costs

- Expense provisions & merger fees allocation to be determined
- Virtue estimated costs: $50-100K (assuming MoFo not drafting significant documents)
- Side letters may need renegotiation between both funds
- Structure optionality important - current GPV proposals very GPV-favorable
- Need to prioritize easiest path for all LPs to obtain consent

### Timeline & Process

- Realistic timeline expectations:
- Holiday season creating calendar constraints
- Consent solicitation analysis needed to identify LP risks on both sides

### Next Steps

- Sean to call Andrew immediately regarding:
	- Alignment on structural optionality (ensure not wedded to specific GPV-favorable options)
	- Goal of finding easiest mechanics for all LPs
- MoFo to provide redlined MOU with key clarifications
- Sean to get compensation terms in writing for protection
- Both sides to review budget as mutually agreed, including compensation details
- Remove feeder fund option from MOU (less attractive than direct merger)

### MSK Pathology Model Results

- New model achieves state-of-the-art for predicting cancer outcomes
- Second blog post draft ready showcasing MSK collaboration
- Significant performance improvement over previous benchmarks
- Will become primary public offering to establish SMB as standard

### Academic Medical Center Strategy

- Partnering with AMCs provides validation that circles back to pharma
- Current partnerships: MSK, Yale, MD Anderson, UCSD
- Reducing onboarding time from several calls to 1 hour (Yale), targeting 2-3 minutes
- Goal: Make it “bad practice” not to fine-tune SMB’s model for AI in biomedicine
- Mayo clinic wants in-person meeting by year-end

### Pharma Business Development

- Sanofi POC already kicked off, expecting to close additional $4.8M by March/April (98% confidence)
- Meeting Ken Branson (GSK) next week
- IQVIA proposal submitted: $44M including compute, first milestone $1M
- Tempest meetings scheduled at JPM with Eric Lafkowski and Ryan Fukushima
- Meeting with various pharma companies showing interest but many still trying to build internally

### Foundation Model Vision

- Consolidating all modalities (genomics, radiology, pathology, longitudinal EHR) into single model
- Three size variants to be distributed
- Purchased 1M oncology CTs from Gradient for $150K (delivery Dec 29)
- Strategy: Force pharma to choose between expensive internal development vs licensing SMB model

### Fundraising Strategy

- Current runway: 10.9 months
- Not formally fundraising but open to raising earlier than later
- Prefer January raise to accelerate AMC partnerships and data licensing
- Two potential paths:

### JPM Investor Meetings

- Half business development, half investor meetings scheduled
- Meeting with: Lux, GV, Obvious, Pioneer, North Pond, Prudent
- Strategy: Share vision rather than hard pitch, filter for aligned investors
- Need to demonstrate team credibility beyond traditional “big tech” backgrounds

### Technical Progress Updates

- Pan-cancer genomics work with UCSD researcher (30 hours/week, unpaid)
- All modalities converging into unified standard model architecture
- Radiology chosen as key modality due to longitudinal standard-of-care nature
- Data delivery from Gradient expected Dec 29, one week training timeline

### Next Steps

- Kevin to send meeting schedule and teaser deck materials
- Create 10-slide teaser deck for JPM meetings
- Begin formal investor outreach for additional meetings
- Continue Sanofi contract finalization
- Finalize data processing pipeline for Gradient CTs

## Virtue / GPV Transaction - MOU
**Granola ID:** 057e6417-87f0-48f6-82db-802f59b11914
**Created:** 2025-12-11T21:00:21.136Z
**Updated:** 2025-12-11T22:16:55.583Z

### Background & Parallel Opportunities

- Sean shared significant context about parallel LP opportunity
	- Prospective LP (known from Ninja in 2002) verbally committed $20-30M for parallel fund on Fund 2
	- Meeting head of fund next week after their diligence process
	- Both GPV and parallel fund aware of each other for transparency
- GPV transaction moving faster than expected
- Early stage venture landscape changed significantly - need more resources/firepower to compete effectively
- Andrew Perlman (GPV co-founder) continuing as one of three GPs, others moving to emeritus status

### Deal Economics & Strategic Rationale

- Personal economics materially different - 2x vs 3x carry structure plus significant salary increase
- GPV bringing $1.5-1.6B AUM plus recent $150M raise
- Combined fund size would be ~$210M (GPV $155M + Virtue $55M)
- Strategic benefits for Virtue:
	- 20+ healthcare system relationships
	- 6-7 pharma partnerships
	- Multi-pronged investment + incubation strategy
	- Ability to save 1-2 fund cycles (5-7 years) by pulling forward opportunities

### MOU Key Terms Review

- Brand positioning: Virtue name secured for investment vehicles
	- Need clearer language that GPV branding phases out for investment activities
	- Future investment team members designated as Virtue team
- 50/50 NewCo management company structure confirmed
- Ratchet considerations regarding LP percentage of fund size (GPV side)
- Budget cross-fund allocation needs timeframe clarification
- LPs will need allocation policy among three funds

### Structural & Governance Issues

- Future/successor funds: all investment vehicles under Virtue, incubation under The Point
- Key Person Clause likely needs either/or structure so no LPs feel disadvantaged in merger
- Roles & responsibilities need clearer delineation:
	- Sean: full decision-making authority on Virtue investment side
	- Andrew: same authority on The Point incubation side
	- Fund-level decisions remain 50/50 with tiebreaker mechanisms needed
- Outside activities/exclusivity provisions need mirroring between parties

### Transaction Mechanics & Costs

- Expense provisions & merger fees allocation to be determined
- Virtue estimated costs: $50-100K (assuming MoFo not drafting significant documents)
- Side letters may need renegotiation between both funds
- Structure optionality important - current GPV proposals very GPV-favorable
- Need to prioritize easiest path for all LPs to obtain consent

### Timeline & Process

- Realistic timeline expectations:
- Holiday season creating calendar constraints
- Consent solicitation analysis needed to identify LP risks on both sides

### Next Steps

- Sean to call Andrew immediately regarding:
	- Alignment on structural optionality (ensure not wedded to specific GPV-favorable options)
	- Goal of finding easiest mechanics for all LPs
- MoFo to provide redlined MOU with key clarifications
- Sean to get compensation terms in writing for protection
- Both sides to review budget as mutually agreed, including compensation details
- Remove feeder fund option from MOU (less attractive than direct merger)

- Partnering with AMCs provides validation that circles back to pharma
- Current partnerships: MSK, Yale, MD Anderson, UCSD
- Reducing onboarding time from several calls to 1 hour (Yale), targeting 2-3 minutes
- Goal: Make it “bad practice” not to fine-tune SMB’s model for AI in biomedicine
- Mayo clinic wants in-person meeting by year-end

### Pharma Business Development

- Sanofi POC already kicked off, expecting to close additional $4.8M by March/April (98% confidence)
- Meeting Ken Branson (GSK) next week
- IQVIA proposal submitted: $44M including compute, first milestone $1M
- Tempest meetings scheduled at JPM with Eric Lafkowski and Ryan Fukushima
- Meeting with various pharma companies showing interest but many still trying to build internally

### Foundation Model Vision

- Consolidating all modalities (genomics, radiology, pathology, longitudinal EHR) into single model
- Three size variants to be distributed
- Purchased 1M oncology CTs from Gradient for $150K (delivery Dec 29)
- Strategy: Force pharma to choose between expensive internal development vs licensing SMB model

### Fundraising Strategy

- Current runway: 10.9 months
- Not formally fundraising but open to raising earlier than later
- Prefer January raise to accelerate AMC partnerships and data licensing
- Two potential paths:

### JPM Investor Meetings

- Half business development, half investor meetings scheduled
- Meeting with: Lux, GV, Obvious, Pioneer, North Pond, Prudent
- Strategy: Share vision rather than hard pitch, filter for aligned investors
- Need to demonstrate team credibility beyond traditional “big tech” backgrounds

### Technical Progress Updates

- Pan-cancer genomics work with UCSD researcher (30 hours/week, unpaid)
- All modalities converging into unified standard model architecture
- Radiology chosen as key modality due to longitudinal standard-of-care nature
- Data delivery from Gradient expected Dec 29, one week training timeline

### Next Steps

- Kevin to send meeting schedule and teaser deck materials
- Create 10-slide teaser deck for JPM meetings
- Begin formal investor outreach for additional meetings
- Continue Sanofi contract finalization
- Finalize data processing pipeline for Gradient CTs

## Virtue / GPV Transaction - MOU
**Granola ID:** 057e6417-87f0-48f6-82db-802f59b11914
**Created:** 2025-12-11T21:00:21.136Z
**Updated:** 2025-12-11T22:16:55.583Z

### Background & Parallel Opportunities

- Sean shared significant context about parallel LP opportunity
	- Prospective LP (known from Ninja in 2002) verbally committed $20-30M for parallel fund on Fund 2
	- Meeting head of fund next week after their diligence process
	- Both GPV and parallel fund aware of each other for transparency
- GPV transaction moving faster than expected
- Early stage venture landscape changed significantly - need more resources/firepower to compete effectively
- Andrew Perlman (GPV co-founder) continuing as one of three GPs, others moving to emeritus status

### Deal Economics & Strategic Rationale

- Personal economics materially different - 2x vs 3x carry structure plus significant salary increase
- GPV bringing $1.5-1.6B AUM plus recent $150M raise
- Combined fund size would be ~$210M (GPV $155M + Virtue $55M)
- Strategic benefits for Virtue:
	- 20+ healthcare system relationships
	- 6-7 pharma partnerships
	- Multi-pronged investment + incubation strategy
	- Ability to save 1-2 fund cycles (5-7 years) by pulling forward opportunities

### MOU Key Terms Review

- Brand positioning: Virtue name secured for investment vehicles
	- Need clearer language that GPV branding phases out for investment activities
	- Future investment team members designated as Virtue team
- 50/50 NewCo management company structure confirmed
- Ratchet considerations regarding LP percentage of fund size (GPV side)
- Budget cross-fund allocation needs timeframe clarification
- LPs will need allocation policy among three funds

### Structural & Governance Issues

- Future/successor funds: all investment vehicles under Virtue, incubation under The Point
- Key Person Clause likely needs either/or structure so no LPs feel disadvantaged in merger
- Roles & responsibilities need clearer delineation:
	- Sean: full decision-making authority on Virtue investment side
	- Andrew: same authority on The Point incubation side
	- Fund-level decisions remain 50/50 with tiebreaker mechanisms needed
- Outside activities/exclusivity provisions need mirroring between parties

### Transaction Mechanics & Costs

- Expense provisions & merger fees allocation to be determined
- Virtue estimated costs: $50-100K (assuming MoFo not drafting significant documents)
- Side letters may need renegotiation between both funds
- Structure optionality important - current GPV proposals very GPV-favorable
- Need to prioritize easiest path for all LPs to obtain consent

### Timeline & Process

- Realistic timeline expectations:
- Holiday season creating calendar constraints
- Consent solicitation analysis needed to identify LP risks on both sides

### Next Steps

- Sean to call Andrew immediately regarding:
	- Alignment on structural optionality (ensure not wedded to specific GPV-favorable options)
	- Goal of finding easiest mechanics for all LPs
- MoFo to provide redlined MOU with key clarifications
- Sean to get compensation terms in writing for protection
- Both sides to review budget as mutually agreed, including compensation details
- Remove feeder fund option from MOU (less attractive than direct merger)

## Virtue / GPV Transaction - MOU
**Granola ID:** 057e6417-87f0-48f6-82db-802f59b11914
**Created:** 2025-12-11T21:00:21.136Z
**Updated:** 2025-12-11T22:16:55.583Z

### Background & Parallel Opportunities

- Sean shared significant context about parallel LP opportunity
	- Prospective LP (known from Ninja in 2002) verbally committed $20-30M for parallel fund on Fund 2
	- Meeting head of fund next week after their diligence process
	- Both GPV and parallel fund aware of each other for transparency
- GPV transaction moving faster than expected
- Early stage venture landscape changed significantly - need more resources/firepower to compete effectively
- Andrew Perlman (GPV co-founder) continuing as one of three GPs, others moving to emeritus status

### Deal Economics & Strategic Rationale

- Personal economics materially different - 2x vs 3x carry structure plus significant salary increase
- GPV bringing $1.5-1.6B AUM plus recent $150M raise
- Combined fund size would be ~$210M (GPV $155M + Virtue $55M)
- Strategic benefits for Virtue:
	- 20+ healthcare system relationships
	- 6-7 pharma partnerships
	- Multi-pronged investment + incubation strategy
	- Ability to save 1-2 fund cycles (5-7 years) by pulling forward opportunities

### MOU Key Terms Review

- Brand positioning: Virtue name secured for investment vehicles
	- Need clearer language that GPV branding phases out for investment activities
	- Future investment team members designated as Virtue team
- 50/50 NewCo management company structure confirmed
- Ratchet considerations regarding LP percentage of fund size (GPV side)
- Budget cross-fund allocation needs timeframe clarification
- LPs will need allocation policy among three funds

### Structural & Governance Issues

- Future/successor funds: all investment vehicles under Virtue, incubation under The Point
- Key Person Clause likely needs either/or structure so no LPs feel disadvantaged in merger
- Roles & responsibilities need clearer delineation:
	- Sean: full decision-making authority on Virtue investment side
	- Andrew: same authority on The Point incubation side
	- Fund-level decisions remain 50/50 with tiebreaker mechanisms needed
- Outside activities/exclusivity provisions need mirroring between parties

### Transaction Mechanics & Costs

- Expense provisions & merger fees allocation to be determined
- Virtue estimated costs: $50-100K (assuming MoFo not drafting significant documents)
- Side letters may need renegotiation between both funds
- Structure optionality important - current GPV proposals very GPV-favorable
- Need to prioritize easiest path for all LPs to obtain consent

### Timeline & Process

- Realistic timeline expectations:
- Holiday season creating calendar constraints
- Consent solicitation analysis needed to identify LP risks on both sides

### Next Steps

- Sean to call Andrew immediately regarding:
	- Alignment on structural optionality (ensure not wedded to specific GPV-favorable options)
	- Goal of finding easiest mechanics for all LPs
- MoFo to provide redlined MOU with key clarifications
- Sean to get compensation terms in writing for protection
- Both sides to review budget as mutually agreed, including compensation details
- Remove feeder fund option from MOU (less attractive than direct merger)

### MSK Pathology Model Results

- New model achieves state-of-the-art for predicting cancer outcomes
- Second blog post draft ready showcasing MSK collaboration
- Significant performance improvement over previous benchmarks
- Will become primary public offering to establish SMB as standard

### Academic Medical Center Strategy

- Partnering with AMCs provides validation that circles back to pharma
- Current partnerships: MSK, Yale, MD Anderson, UCSD
- Reducing onboarding time from several calls to 1 hour (Yale), targeting 2-3 minutes
- Goal: Make it “bad practice” not to fine-tune SMB’s model for AI in biomedicine
- Mayo clinic wants in-person meeting by year-end

### Pharma Business Development

- Sanofi POC already kicked off, expecting to close additional $4.8M by March/April (98% confidence)
- Meeting Ken Branson (GSK) next week
- IQVIA proposal submitted: $44M including compute, first milestone $1M
- Tempest meetings scheduled at JPM with Eric Lafkowski and Ryan Fukushima
- Meeting with various pharma companies showing interest but many still trying to build internally

### Foundation Model Vision

- Consolidating all modalities (genomics, radiology, pathology, longitudinal EHR) into single model
- Three size variants to be distributed
- Purchased 1M oncology CTs from Gradient for $150K (delivery Dec 29)
- Strategy: Force pharma to choose between expensive internal development vs licensing SMB model

### Fundraising Strategy

- Current runway: 10.9 months
- Not formally fundraising but open to raising earlier than later
- Prefer January raise to accelerate AMC partnerships and data licensing
- Two potential paths:

### JPM Investor Meetings

- Half business development, half investor meetings scheduled
- Meeting with: Lux, GV, Obvious, Pioneer, North Pond, Prudent
- Strategy: Share vision rather than hard pitch, filter for aligned investors
- Need to demonstrate team credibility beyond traditional “big tech” backgrounds

### Technical Progress Updates

- Pan-cancer genomics work with UCSD researcher (30 hours/week, unpaid)
- All modalities converging into unified standard model architecture

- Andrew Perlman (GPV co-founder) continuing as one of three GPs, others moving to emeritus status

### Deal Economics & Strategic Rationale

- Personal economics materially different - 2x vs 3x carry structure plus significant salary increase
- GPV bringing $1.5-1.6B AUM plus recent $150M raise
- Combined fund size would be ~$210M (GPV $155M + Virtue $55M)
- Strategic benefits for Virtue:
	- 20+ healthcare system relationships
	- 6-7 pharma partnerships
	- Multi-pronged investment + incubation strategy
	- Ability to save 1-2 fund cycles (5-7 years) by pulling forward opportunities

### MOU Key Terms Review

- Brand positioning: Virtue name secured for investment vehicles
	- Need clearer language that GPV branding phases out for investment activities
	- Future investment team members designated as Virtue team
- 50/50 NewCo management company structure confirmed
- Ratchet considerations regarding LP percentage of fund size (GPV side)
- Budget cross-fund allocation needs timeframe clarification
- LPs will need allocation policy among three funds

### Structural & Governance Issues

- Future/successor funds: all investment vehicles under Virtue, incubation under The Point
- Key Person Clause likely needs either/or structure so no LPs feel disadvantaged in merger
- Roles & responsibilities need clearer delineation:
	- Sean: full decision-making authority on Virtue investment side
	- Andrew: same authority on The Point incubation side
	- Fund-level decisions remain 50/50 with tiebreaker mechanisms needed
- Outside activities/exclusivity provisions need mirroring between parties

### Transaction Mechanics & Costs

- Expense provisions & merger fees allocation to be determined
- Virtue estimated costs: $50-100K (assuming MoFo not drafting significant documents)
- Side letters may need renegotiation between both funds
- Structure optionality important - current GPV proposals very GPV-favorable
- Need to prioritize easiest path for all LPs to obtain consent

### Timeline & Process

- Realistic timeline expectations:
- Holiday season creating calendar constraints
- Consent solicitation analysis needed to identify LP risks on both sides

### Next Steps

- Sean to call Andrew immediately regarding:
	- Alignment on structural optionality (ensure not wedded to specific GPV-favorable options)
	- Goal of finding easiest mechanics for all LPs
- MoFo to provide redlined MOU with key clarifications
- Sean to get compensation terms in writing for protection
- Both sides to review budget as mutually agreed, including compensation details
- Remove feeder fund option from MOU (less attractive than direct merger)

### MSK Pathology Model Results

- New model achieves state-of-the-art for predicting cancer outcomes
- Second blog post draft ready showcasing MSK collaboration
- Significant performance improvement over previous benchmarks
- Will become primary public offering to establish SMB as standard

### Academic Medical Center Strategy

- Partnering with AMCs provides validation that circles back to pharma
- Current partnerships: MSK, Yale, MD Anderson, UCSD
- Reducing onboarding time from several calls to 1 hour (Yale), targeting 2-3 minutes
- Goal: Make it “bad practice” not to fine-tune SMB’s model for AI in biomedicine
- Mayo clinic wants in-person meeting by year-end

### Pharma Business Development

- Sanofi POC already kicked off, expecting to close additional $4.8M by March/April (98% confidence)
- Meeting Ken Branson (GSK) next week
- IQVIA proposal submitted: $44M including compute, first milestone $1M
- Tempest meetings scheduled at JPM with Eric Lafkowski and Ryan Fukushima
- Meeting with various pharma companies showing interest but many still trying to build internally

### Foundation Model Vision

- Consolidating all modalities (genomics, radiology, pathology, longitudinal EHR) into single model
- Three size variants to be distributed
- Purchased 1M oncology CTs from Gradient for $150K (delivery Dec 29)
- Strategy: Force pharma to choose between expensive internal development vs licensing SMB model

### Fundraising Strategy

- Current runway: 10.9 months
- Not formally fundraising but open to raising earlier than later
- Prefer January raise to accelerate AMC partnerships and data licensing
- Two potential paths:

### JPM Investor Meetings

- Half business development, half investor meetings scheduled
- Meeting with: Lux, GV, Obvious, Pioneer, North Pond, Prudent
- Strategy: Share vision rather than hard pitch, filter for aligned investors
- Need to demonstrate team credibility beyond traditional “big tech” backgrounds

### Technical Progress Updates

- Pan-cancer genomics work with UCSD researcher (30 hours/week, unpaid)
- All modalities converging into unified standard model architecture
- Radiology chosen as key modality due to longitudinal standard-of-care nature
- Data delivery from Gradient expected Dec 29, one week training timeline

### Next Steps

- Kevin to send meeting schedule and teaser deck materials
- Create 10-slide teaser deck for JPM meetings
- Begin formal investor outreach for additional meetings
- Continue Sanofi contract finalization
- Finalize data processing pipeline for Gradient CTs

- Expense provisions & merger fees allocation to be determined
- Virtue estimated costs: $50-100K (assuming MoFo not drafting significant documents)
- Side letters may need renegotiation between both funds
- Structure optionality important - current GPV proposals very GPV-favorable
- Need to prioritize easiest path for all LPs to obtain consent

### Timeline & Process

- Realistic timeline expectations:
- Holiday season creating calendar constraints
- Consent solicitation analysis needed to identify LP risks on both sides

### Next Steps

- Sean to call Andrew immediately regarding:
	- Alignment on structural optionality (ensure not wedded to specific GPV-favorable options)
	- Goal of finding easiest mechanics for all LPs
- MoFo to provide redlined MOU with key clarifications
- Sean to get compensation terms in writing for protection
- Both sides to review budget as mutually agreed, including compensation details
- Remove feeder fund option from MOU (less attractive than direct merger)

### MSK Pathology Model Results

- New model achieves state-of-the-art for predicting cancer outcomes
- Second blog post draft ready showcasing MSK collaboration
- Significant performance improvement over previous benchmarks
- Will become primary public offering to establish SMB as standard

### Academic Medical Center Strategy

- Partnering with AMCs provides validation that circles back to pharma
- Current partnerships: MSK, Yale, MD Anderson, UCSD
- Reducing onboarding time from several calls to 1 hour (Yale), targeting 2-3 minutes
- Goal: Make it “bad practice” not to fine-tune SMB’s model for AI in biomedicine
- Mayo clinic wants in-person meeting by year-end

### Pharma Business Development

- Sanofi POC already kicked off, expecting to close additional $4.8M by March/April (98% confidence)
- Meeting Ken Branson (GSK) next week
- IQVIA proposal submitted: $44M including compute, first milestone $1M
- Tempest meetings scheduled at JPM with Eric Lafkowski and Ryan Fukushima
- Meeting with various pharma companies showing interest but many still trying to build internally

### Foundation Model Vision

- Consolidating all modalities (genomics, radiology, pathology, longitudinal EHR) into single model
- Three size variants to be distributed
- Purchased 1M oncology CTs from Gradient for $150K (delivery Dec 29)
- Strategy: Force pharma to choose between expensive internal development vs licensing SMB model

### Fundraising Strategy

- Current runway: 10.9 months
- Not formally fundraising but open to raising earlier than later
- Prefer January raise to accelerate AMC partnerships and data licensing
- Two potential paths:

### JPM Investor Meetings

- Half business development, half investor meetings scheduled
- Meeting with: Lux, GV, Obvious, Pioneer, North Pond, Prudent
- Strategy: Share vision rather than hard pitch, filter for aligned investors
- Need to demonstrate team credibility beyond traditional “big tech” backgrounds

### Technical Progress Updates

- Pan-cancer genomics work with UCSD researcher (30 hours/week, unpaid)
- All modalities converging into unified standard model architecture
- Radiology chosen as key modality due to longitudinal standard-of-care nature
- Data delivery from Gradient expected Dec 29, one week training timeline

### Next Steps

- Kevin to send meeting schedule and teaser deck materials
- Create 10-slide teaser deck for JPM meetings
- Begin formal investor outreach for additional meetings
- Continue Sanofi contract finalization
- Finalize data processing pipeline for Gradient CTs

## Virtue / GPV Transaction - MOU
**Granola ID:** 057e6417-87f0-48f6-82db-802f59b11914
**Created:** 2025-12-11T21:00:21.136Z
**Updated:** 2025-12-11T22:16:55.583Z

### Background & Parallel Opportunities

- Sean shared significant context about parallel LP opportunity
	- Prospective LP (known from Ninja in 2002) verbally committed $20-30M for parallel fund on Fund 2
	- Meeting head of fund next week after their diligence process
	- Both GPV and parallel fund aware of each other for transparency
- GPV transaction moving faster than expected
- Early stage venture landscape changed significantly - need more resources/firepower to compete effectively
- Andrew Perlman (GPV co-founder) continuing as one of three GPs, others moving to emeritus status

### Deal Economics & Strategic Rationale

- Personal economics materially different - 2x vs 3x carry structure plus significant salary increase
- GPV bringing $1.5-1.6B AUM plus recent $150M raise
- Combined fund size would be ~$210M (GPV $155M + Virtue $55M)
- Strategic benefits for Virtue:
	- 20+ healthcare system relationships
	- 6-7 pharma partnerships
	- Multi-pronged investment + incubation strategy
	- Ability to save 1-2 fund cycles (5-7 years) by pulling forward opportunities

### MOU Key Terms Review

- Brand positioning: Virtue name secured for investment vehicles
	- Need clearer language that GPV branding phases out for investment activities
	- Future investment team members designated as Virtue team
- 50/50 NewCo management company structure confirmed
- Ratchet considerations regarding LP percentage of fund size (GPV side)
- Budget cross-fund allocation needs timeframe clarification
- LPs will need allocation policy among three funds

### Structural & Governance Issues

- Future/successor funds: all investment vehicles under Virtue, incubation under The Point
- Key Person Clause likely needs either/or structure so no LPs feel disadvantaged in merger
- Roles & responsibilities need clearer delineation:
	- Sean: full decision-making authority on Virtue investment side
	- Andrew: same authority on The Point incubation side
	- Fund-level decisions remain 50/50 with tiebreaker mechanisms needed
- Outside activities/exclusivity provisions need mirroring between parties

### Transaction Mechanics & Costs

- Expense provisions & merger fees allocation to be determined
- Virtue estimated costs: $50-100K (assuming MoFo not drafting significant documents)
- Side letters may need renegotiation between both funds
- Structure optionality important - current GPV proposals very GPV-favorable

### MSK Pathology Model Results

- New model achieves state-of-the-art for predicting cancer outcomes
- Second blog post draft ready showcasing MSK collaboration
- Significant performance improvement over previous benchmarks
- Will become primary public offering to establish SMB as standard

### Academic Medical Center Strategy

- Partnering with AMCs provides validation that circles back to pharma
- Current partnerships: MSK, Yale, MD Anderson, UCSD
- Reducing onboarding time from several calls to 1 hour (Yale), targeting 2-3 minutes
- Goal: Make it “bad practice” not to fine-tune SMB’s model for AI in biomedicine
- Mayo clinic wants in-person meeting by year-end

### Pharma Business Development

- Sanofi POC already kicked off, expecting to close additional $4.8M by March/April (98% confidence)
- Meeting Ken Branson (GSK) next week
- IQVIA proposal submitted: $44M including compute, first milestone $1M
- Tempest meetings scheduled at JPM with Eric Lafkowski and Ryan Fukushima
- Meeting with various pharma companies showing interest but many still trying to build internally

### Foundation Model Vision

- Consolidating all modalities (genomics, radiology, pathology, longitudinal EHR) into single model
- Three size variants to be distributed
- Purchased 1M oncology CTs from Gradient for $150K (delivery Dec 29)
- Strategy: Force pharma to choose between expensive internal development vs licensing SMB model

### Fundraising Strategy

- Current runway: 10.9 months
- Not formally fundraising but open to raising earlier than later
- Prefer January raise to accelerate AMC partnerships and data licensing
- Two potential paths:

### JPM Investor Meetings

- Half business development, half investor meetings scheduled
- Meeting with: Lux, GV, Obvious, Pioneer, North Pond, Prudent
- Strategy: Share vision rather than hard pitch, filter for aligned investors
- Need to demonstrate team credibility beyond traditional “big tech” backgrounds

### Technical Progress Updates

- Pan-cancer genomics work with UCSD researcher (30 hours/week, unpaid)
- All modalities converging into unified standard model architecture
- Radiology chosen as key modality due to longitudinal standard-of-care nature
- Data delivery from Gradient expected Dec 29, one week training timeline

### Next Steps

- Kevin to send meeting schedule and teaser deck materials
- Create 10-slide teaser deck for JPM meetings
- Begin formal investor outreach for additional meetings
- Continue Sanofi contract finalization
- Finalize data processing pipeline for Gradient CTs

## Virtue / GPV Transaction - MOU
**Granola ID:** 057e6417-87f0-48f6-82db-802f59b11914
**Created:** 2025-12-11T21:00:21.136Z
**Updated:** 2025-12-11T22:16:55.583Z

### Background & Parallel Opportunities

- Sean shared significant context about parallel LP opportunity
	- Prospective LP (known from Ninja in 2002) verbally committed $20-30M for parallel fund on Fund 2
	- Meeting head of fund next week after their diligence process
	- Both GPV and parallel fund aware of each other for transparency
- GPV transaction moving faster than expected
- Early stage venture landscape changed significantly - need more resources/firepower to compete effectively
- Andrew Perlman (GPV co-founder) continuing as one of three GPs, others moving to emeritus status

### Deal Economics & Strategic Rationale

- Personal economics materially different - 2x vs 3x carry structure plus significant salary increase
- GPV bringing $1.5-1.6B AUM plus recent $150M raise
- Combined fund size would be ~$210M (GPV $155M + Virtue $55M)
- Strategic benefits for Virtue:
	- 20+ healthcare system relationships
	- 6-7 pharma partnerships
	- Multi-pronged investment + incubation strategy
	- Ability to save 1-2 fund cycles (5-7 years) by pulling forward opportunities

### MOU Key Terms Review

- Brand positioning: Virtue name secured for investment vehicles
	- Need clearer language that GPV branding phases out for investment activities
	- Future investment team members designated as Virtue team
- 50/50 NewCo management company structure confirmed
- Ratchet considerations regarding LP percentage of fund size (GPV side)
- Budget cross-fund allocation needs timeframe clarification
- LPs will need allocation policy among three funds

### Structural & Governance Issues

- Future/successor funds: all investment vehicles under Virtue, incubation under The Point
- Key Person Clause likely needs either/or structure so no LPs feel disadvantaged in merger
- Roles & responsibilities need clearer delineation:
	- Sean: full decision-making authority on Virtue investment side
	- Andrew: same authority on The Point incubation side
	- Fund-level decisions remain 50/50 with tiebreaker mechanisms needed
- Outside activities/exclusivity provisions need mirroring between parties

### Transaction Mechanics & Costs

- Expense provisions & merger fees allocation to be determined
- Virtue estimated costs: $50-100K (assuming MoFo not drafting significant documents)
- Side letters may need renegotiation between both funds
- Structure optionality important - current GPV proposals very GPV-favorable
- Need to prioritize easiest path for all LPs to obtain consent

### Timeline & Process

- Realistic timeline expectations:
- Holiday season creating calendar constraints
- Consent solicitation analysis needed to identify LP risks on both sides

### Next Steps

- Sean to call Andrew immediately regarding:
	- Alignment on structural optionality (ensure not wedded to specific GPV-favorable options)
	- Goal of finding easiest mechanics for all LPs
- MoFo to provide redlined MOU with key clarifications
- Sean to get compensation terms in writing for protection
- Both sides to review budget as mutually agreed, including compensation details
- Remove feeder fund option from MOU (less attractive than direct merger)
