Pharma Tech Sector Brief

Harris Williams | Q4 2023

## Slide 2: Outsourced Pharma Services and Pharma Tech: Observations and Key Trends

Biopharmaceutical companies increasingly rely on technology and service vendors to accelerate research and development and time to market as well as optimize commercial success of therapies.

**Discovery**
*   **Increasing Complexity and Cost of R&D Process**
    The indications that pharma is targeting for new therapies are becoming increasingly complex and focused, resulting in higher overall discovery and development costs. These therapeutics, which are more frequently large molecule, are targeting significantly smaller, more complex patient populations, making it more difficult and costly to recruit and retain patients in clinical trials.

**Research & Development**

**Launch**
*   **Supply Chain Visibility**
    With significant manufacturing capacity in India and China, global supply chain concerns have impacted pharmaceutical companies, which depend on specialized networks to bring finished products to market. Pharma is looking to solutions that either enhance supply chain visibility and enable detailed tracking and monitoring of all stages of the process, or bring manufacturing onshore.

**Post-Launch / In-Market**

Pharmaceutical companies, under pressure to increase efficiencies, maximize returns on approved therapies, and accelerate development cycles, are looking to optimize every portion of the development and commercialization life cycle.

Service and technology partners that accelerate time to market and streamline commercialization drive significant value in the increasingly competitive marketplace.

**Legacy Commercialization Approaches Are No Longer Effective**
As many blockbuster pharmaceuticals approach the ends of their patented lives and face generic competition, pharma manufacturers are targeting growth through niche opportunities with smaller addressable markets. Effectively commercializing these therapies requires robust services and technology solutions that enable companies to identify key HCP influencers, find affected individuals, and change behavior. Commercialization partners increasingly have to specialize their service offerings to accommodate niche therapeutic areas, patient populations, and specific clinician groups.

**Tech Implementation and Evolving Sites of Care Driving Efficiency in Clinical Trials**
Increasing development costs are driving a focus on tech and specialized clinical trial sites to create efficiencies, provide cost savings, and allow pharma to manage narrow available patient populations.

COVID-19 has accelerated the pace of change toward remote and decentralized testing, as well as how and where patients receive care. Effectively managing trials and messaging requires technology solutions and service vendors that are able to find and meet stakeholders where they already are.

*   **Challenges With Payors**
    As pharmaceutical products become increasingly specialized and more costly, payors are pushing back and requiring robust outcomes evidence to support reimbursement.
*   **Focus on RWE**
    Real-world evidence (RWE) and data are playing increasingly crucial roles in clinical and commercialization stages of development, helping pharma manufacturers quickly and effectively bring therapies to market and identify and prove out additional indications.
*   **Targeting Adherence**
    As target populations decrease, and the cost of commercialization increases, pharma is increasingly focused on solutions that keep patients engaged and adherent to their courses of care.

**Key Trends (across categories)**
*   Pharma companies' data aggregation capabilities are maturing, using RWE not only to demonstrate the value of their products, but increasingly to address regulatory requirements, drive drug development, support outcomes-based contracts, and reduce products' time to market

**Technology Solutions**
Technology tools that accelerate development and time to market across the entire product life cycle
*   Lead Optimization
*   Safety & Toxicology
*   R&D Workflow

*   Emphasis on outsourcing key functions across marketing, digital enablement, commercialization, market access, and data analytics has driven development of a diverse and well-funded ecosystem of solution providers
*   Platforms are accelerating consolidation as they seek to provide a one-stop shop for their pharma clients, widening the scope of offerings while deepening their insight capabilities through acquisition of unique data assets or best-in-class analytical engines
*   Manufacturers and service providers are looking for technology solutions that add robust data and analytics functions to their commercialization efforts, enabling faster and more efficient targeting of patients, providers, and key stakeholders
*   Growing volumes of virtual trials require capabilities for increasingly specific trial designs, requiring solutions that are capable of enhanced patient targeting, trial management, patient adherence, and agile response and data collection

**McKinsey | Rewired Pharma Companies Will Win in the Digital Age**
**Operations**
Market leaders are using innovations in data operations to reorient their organizations around outcomes, not around processes, as previously was the case. By leveraging more sophisticated methods to automate data use, advanced DataOps will allow better collaboration within enterprises and teams and, subsequently, drive top-level savings when implemented properly.

**BCG | Biopharma's Path to Value with Generative AI**
**Digital Integration**
Generative AI has continued to permeate the drug development process, allowing companies to leverage unstructured data, which previously was rarely usable, into a go-to source for their findings. However, these companies will also need to face growing regulatory burdens in determining how this AI can be used, and in what ways their findings can be based on AI-Generated analysis. Still, particularly within biopharma, generative AI is likely to radically change the time and effort needed to clear both internal and external hurdles.

**Citeline | Pharma R&D Annual Review 2023**
**Market Dynamics**
There have been growing contributions by smaller biopharmaceutical players in terms of raw R&D spend and the creation of new compounds. These smaller, more agile firms have also shown a growing interest in treating a small collection of rare diseases in which they specialize. By contrast, gene and cell therapy, largely in the pursuit of treating cancer, has held its position as the most common research category.
