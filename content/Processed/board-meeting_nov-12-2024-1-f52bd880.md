## Slide 8: Reconciling a PMPM Guarantee
PRODUCT OVERVIEW

Simplified unit of measurement and comparison for Plan Sponsors.

**Guarantee**
The guarantee is negotiated using the WriteWise platform before the first year of a PBM contract.

**Monitor**
WriteWise monitors the plan performance throughout the year with a data feed integrated directly into the PBM.

**Audit**
WriteWise will audit the plan performance at the end of the contract year.

**Reconcile**
