### M&A Acquisition Pipeline

- Minnesota and Missouri deals progressing
	- Purchase prices minimal - can build ground up
	- Missouri: signing purchase agreement within 2 weeks
	- Increased rates, less competitive market
	- Platform building opportunity
- Florida opportunity emerging
	- Owner folding operations after 6 months
	- Can’t make economics work at current scale
	- Personal guarantee on lease - renegotiation possible
	- Cost of launch would be minimal
- Future pipeline strategy
	- Broker sourcing next 3-5 markets
	- Long tail of subscale operators realizing model not viable
	- Can acquire distressed assets for $250k or less

### Build vs Buy Strategy Discussion

- Current approach: acquisitions due to speed constraints
	- Building takes 12 months for contracting/licensing/credentialing
	- Don’t have time given current thesis execution
- Blueprint narrative considerations for next OPCO
	- Building conflicts with Anna origin story
	- Different investor questions: PE rollup vs incubation engine
	- Could create stronger narrative around capital allocation agnostic approach
	- Speed to market prioritized over build methodology
- Hybrid approach planned
	- Start contracting/credentialing process early with 1099 clinicians
	- Parallel process M&A if building doesn’t work
	- Aqua-hire model different from rolling up $5-10M EBITDA clinics

### Fundraising Update

- $2.7M round closing next Wednesday
	- Sunflower and Watershed committed
	- One investor still reviewing
	- May need additional $2M but hoping to avoid new process
- Documentation complete
	- Council sent materials last night
	- Pro rata waiver expected

### Next Steps

- Year-end financials completion before board meeting
- Board meeting scheduling pending systems closing
- Updates on M&A progress and blueprint development
- Tyler GC consultation on comparable financing structures
