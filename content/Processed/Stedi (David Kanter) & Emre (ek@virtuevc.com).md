### Stedi Background & Healthcare Pivot

- Healthcare became fastest growing vertical over first 3 years
- Built clearinghouse infrastructure without initially realizing it
- Past 2 years focused explicitly on healthcare clearinghouse business
- David serves as GM over clearinghouse - sales, GTM strategy, ops, technical success, solutions engineering

### Customer Base & Market Focus

- 75% of customers are RCM companies, EHRs, practice management systems providing software services to providers
- 25% are actual providers (tech-first, tech-forward providers)
- Target customers include Phreesia, R1, Ensemble - aggregators in RCM space
- Seeing surge in Gen AI companies for healthcare billing automation all signing up for Stedi
- Strong growth in dental market - described as “out of control”
	- Dental software 3-5 years behind medical
	- More fragmented with independent practitioners
	- Running same playbook as medical

### Platform Capabilities & Expansion

- Currently handle eligibility, claims, remittance, claim status
- Don’t do prior auth today - whole new surface area
- Starting to consider EFT enrollment alongside existing ERA enrollment
	- Challenge: Different payer processes (portals, faxes, e-signatures)
	- Stripe is largest investor, interested in payment processing
- Launched provider direct accounts pre-integrated with practice management systems
	- Allows providers to have own Stedi account vs PM system rebuilding Stedi

### Business Development Opportunities

- Open to portfolio company referrals unhappy with existing clearinghouse
- Hiring: Looking for leadership roles to fill gaps
- Will intro to Vincura (Tim, co-founder) - focused on financial reconciliation
- Mentioned Pace Health conversation earlier this week
	- Need to submit encounter claims to CMS
	- Low volumes, probably not worth building dedicated integration
