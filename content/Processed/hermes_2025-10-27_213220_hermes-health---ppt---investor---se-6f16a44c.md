## Slide 1: Hermes Health
Hermes Health
Neutral. Trusted. Connected.

## Slide 2: The Team & Founder
CEO & Founder: Alejandro Zamorano

I've spent the last six years at the ground floor of building the rails for identified and de-identified health data movement at Datavant.

I know how data moves and I know all the players.
* Spearhead record retrieval solutions for life sciences at Datavant (2024).
* Led Datavant's Life Sciences vertical, scaled revenue from inception (2019 to 2024).

## Slide 3: Identified Health Data the Future
Identified Health Data is 10x More Valuable than De-identified Data.

**Identified Data:** $150 to $300 per patient
* Enables direct patient-level action
* Clear provenance
* Clearly measurable ROI
* Rich data profile

**De-Identified Data:** $0.01 to $10 per patient
* Limited to population analysis
* Unclear provenance
* Hard to measure outcomes
* Limited data profile

| Use Case                  | De-Identified                                         | Identified                                                    |
| :------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Clinical Trials Recruitment** | Protocol design and feasibility                       | Qualify patients directly for a particular study              |
| **Life Insurance**        | Analyze broad health trends and mortality for actuarial models | Underwrite a specific policy for individual                   |
| **Health Care Operations**| Process optimization and benchmarking                 | Patient specific billing audit and fraud detection            |
| **Life Sciences**         | Aggregated health and outcomes research               | Find exact source of an adverse event with full clinical context |

## Slide 4: Identified Data – a $12B Untapped Market.

## Slide 5: Why Now?
The De-identified and Identified Worlds have Evolved in Isolation — They are now set to Converge.

| De-Identified World                                               | Identified World                                                                                                    |
| :---------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Built comfort exchanging health data across 1,000+ sources        | Largely unaware that health data can be traded or licensed                                                          |
| Market is mature; data is commoditized                            | Still rely on fax and manual workflows                                                                              |
| Growth pressure is creating push for new markets and use cases    | Few know how to license or value health data                                                                        |
| Hesitate to power identified workflows due to compliance risks    | Early APIs from Epic, Athena, Office Ally, Waystar are starting to create data liquidity                            |
| Limited knowledge of use cases that require identified health data (this was intentional as cultural norm) | However the market lack technical, operational, and legal knowledge to implement                                    |

## Slide 6: Problem: Identified Data is Stuck in the Past
Access to Identified Data is Fragmented, Full of Friction, and Labor Intensive

**The Problem**
HIEs and TEFCA were designed to enable seamless health data exchange but in practice, its made it worse. Access to identified data is still full of friction.
* **Fragmentation:** 1,000+ data custodians with limited footprint and coverage.
* **Multiple Connections:** Requestors need multiple data sources to meet their needs.
* **Friction:** Labor cost of $100 to pull one medical record
* **Confusion:** Varying channels to get medical records (fax, bespoke requestor portals, and limited APIs).

**Diagram: Fragmented Network**
A circular diagram showing various entities (Patient Registry, CRO, Health Plan, Clinic, HIE, EHR, Claims, Hospital, ROI, Imaging, Law Firm, Life Insurance, EHR) all connected to each other with crisscrossing lines, indicating a lack of centralized connection.

## Slide 7: Solution: One Network. One API. One Workflow.
Identified Data needs a Trusted Network that Reduces Friction, Turnaround Times, and Enforces Rules.

| Requestors           | Custodians               |
| :------------------- | :----------------------- |
| Law Firms            | Release of Information   |
| Life Insurance       | Claims Clearinghouses    |
| Health Plans         | EHR Software             |
| CRO's                | Imaging Software         |
| Healthcare Operations| Hospitals                |
| Patient Registries   | Clinics                  |

**Diagram: Centralized Network**
A circular diagram showing various entities (Patient Registry, CRO, Health Plan, Clinic, HIE, EHR, Claims, Hospital, ROI, Imaging, Law Firm, Life Insurance, EHR) all connected to a central "HERMES HEALTH" hub, indicating a unified network.

## Slide 8: Network Effect & Value
Hermes Provides Value to Both the Requestor and the Custodian – Creating a Reinforcing Flywheel effect.

| Requestor                                                                                                                                              | Custodian                                                                                                                                                             |
| :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Faster Turnaround: More Revenue** Data comes back in minutes instead of weeks                                                                        | **More Demand: More Revenue** Hermes reduces the friction to request and deliver data; inducing demand for the Custodian's data.                                          |
| **More Data: More Revenue** More data enables Requestors to unlock new markets and use cases.                                                          | **Implementation Burden: Less Cost** Hermes handles integrations with Requestors so Custodians don't have to manage one-off tech implementations and maintenance. |
| **Less Overhead: Less Cost** One API to submit and retrieve identified health data no more bespoke connections, integrations, and maintenance.           | **Scalable Intake: Less Cost** Requests arrives in a single, standardized format. Unlocking lower operational cost, faster routing, and simplified scaling.             |

**Flywheel Effect Diagram:**
* **More Requestors** -> **More Record Volume** -> **Faster and Easier Records** -> **More Vendors Integrate to Capture Volume** -> **More Requestors**
* The center of the flywheel is "Hermes Health Flywheel Effect".

## Slide 10: Access & Delivery Layer
Our Access and Delivery Layer Connects Requestor to Custodians

**Access and Delivery Layer**
* **Intake:** Requestors securely submit patient's full name, date of birth, and a signed HIPAA Authorization form.
* **Smart Routing:** The Unity Platform then routes these requests to our network of Custodians.
* **Partner Fulfillment:** Custodians processes these Requests and transmit data back to Hermes
* **Delivery:** Hermes delivers the data back to Requestors without revealing Custodian specific infrastructure—protecting privacy, and confidentiality
* **Transparent Pricing:** Custodian is paid on a per-record/patient fee.

## Slide 15: The Business Model
We have a Simple Pricing that Scales as our Network Grows.

**Business Model**
*   Hermes monetizes the Requestors.
*   Hermes pays the Custodian on a per record or patient basis based on the dataset.
*   Gross margin is the spread between what we charge Requestors and what Partners charge us.
*   As automation and network density grow, gross margins expand.

| Category                      | Price                     | Margin |
| :---------------------------- | :------------------------ | :----- |
| Annual Platform               | $10,000 to $100,000       | 90%    |
| Record Request (End to End)   | $50 Per Record            | 20%    |
| Record Request (Routing)      | $5 Per Record             | 80%    |
| Site Sonar                    | $15 Per Patient           | 66%    |
| HIPAA Checker and Site Finder | $1 Per Call               | 50%    |

## Slide 16: Strategic Vision & Goals
To Win the Network we Must Execute on the Strategic Goals Below.

**Phases of Growth (Timeline based on vertical axis, progress left to right):**

*   **Phase 1: Relevance**
    *   Build Atomic Network
    *   Build the smallest minimum viable network to validate requestor and custodian interest
*   **Phase 2: Ubiquity**
    *   Achieve Requestor and Custodian Ubiquity
    *   Use the momentum to create network to create a self-reinforcing flywheel effect and gravitational pull.
    *   *Indicator: We are Here (located within Phase 2)*
*   **Phase 3: Scale**
    *   Expand to New Markets
    *   Use the network density to expand into more markets.
*   **Phase 4: Monetize**
    *   Unlock New Use Cases

## Slide 17: MOAT
Hermes Health's Moat = Network Density × Neutrality × Economies of Scale × Product Velocity

**Connection Density**
More Custodian connections mean fewer reasons for Requestors to build their own. Each link strengthens the network.

**Neutrality**
We don't compete with Custodians or our Requestors—our neutrality builds trust and drives adoption.

**Economies of Scale**
More volume allows us to negotiate lower Custodian costs, enabling us to pass these savings to our Requestors.

**Products Velocity**
Our workflow innovations make data exchange seamless for Custodians and Requestors. This speed lets us outperform networks of similar size with slower product cycles.

**Diagram: Concentric Circles representing Moat components (from outermost to innermost)**

## Slide 25: Partners Can't Be The Center
**Why Can't Partners Be The Center**

*   **Competitive Conflict:** Partners compete with each other, making it difficult for any single partner to act as a neutral hub for all.
*   **Limited Footprint:** Individual partners have a limited footprint on a patient data record. As a result they cannot fulfill all requests.
*   **Trust:** Partners don't trust each other and as a result hesitate to share proprietary information directly with each other, restricting cooperation.
*   **Complex Integration:** Direct connections among multiple partners create costly complexity, duplication, and labor.

**Image:** Illustration of a group of disgruntled business people, implying conflict and lack of cooperation.
