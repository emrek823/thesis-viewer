### Product offering and early financial performance Qs

Recognizing this may change, can you walk us through the current suite of products (PMPM Guarantee, RxProtect, Subscription Rx) WriteWise offers?

WriteWise sells 3 insurance products based on the same underlying algorithms and data stack (image and table below).

Can you further clarify the target customer for each (e.g., broker, employer, PBM wholesale)?

The employer (or the MGA that pools together employers) is the customer and who drives revenue for WriteWise. However, as with many successful businesses in the employer space, WriteWise serves the needs and aligns incentives for multiple stakeholders in the employer ecosystem.

PBMs: 3rd party guarantee that wins RFPs.

MGU: More accurate underwriting (5-25% cheaper stop-loss quotes) wins more business

Brokers/Consultants: Faster renewals and co-branded analytics to win more business

TPA: White-label pharmacy stewardship module that drives extra admin fees for TPA

Currently, the employer (or an MGA that aggregates multiple employers) signs the contract and funds the premium, but WriteWise deliberately keeps every stakeholder economically aligned. Beginning in 2026, the company will launch a SaaS version of its MavRx portal. Transparent PBMs and large brokers will pay a six-month licence fee that acts as a floor, and if PBM/broker’s RFP wins exceed a preset premium hurdle, WriteWise swaps the flat fee for a revenue-share on the upside. This rewards channel partners for pushing more employer groups through the platform, gives WriteWise uncapped upside, and continuously feeds fresh claims data back into the predictive engine to shorten sales cycles.

As discussed more below (Future Growth Opportunities…) this ability to optimize GTM channels is a major advantage in the employer space.

Does the company have any material outstanding claims liabilities or unpaid claims obligations? If so, is it at a level you, and customers, are comfortable with?

WriteWise doesn’t shoulder the risk on their balance sheet and employs models that are tried and true in the MGA/MGU space. All claim dollars (both premium inflow and pending reimbursements) are off WriteWise’s balance sheet. WriteWise works with SiriusPoint currently, for example, to have escrow-style trust accounts for employer premiums (RxProtect stop loss)

You mentioned that they have achieved >99% accuracy with the existing prediction model - can you speak to how actual claims experience from the underwritten employer groups has tracked relative to their initial projections so far?

There are 2 pieces to how we define “accuracy”: 1) Audit accuracy and 2) Prediction accuracy.

Audit accuracy. See the image below. WriteWise has >99% audit accuracy, which means translating PBM contracts to structured data that can be used to make decisions for downstream prediction tasks.

Prediction. Across the 2024 groups, actual utilization is tracking within .5% of the forecast trend line produced at bind. The Rx Protect stop-loss layer has a 0% loss ratio (no claims broke the attachment), while the Essential / PMPM-Guarantee tier is running ~10 %, which is inside the corridor. Early renewals are also positive. One group renewed flat and another at a modest 10 % adjustment, suggesting the guarantees remain credible without large premium hikes.

Saw you mentioned the company's interest in Q1 for pursuing a programmatic approach for rising GLP-1 demand; if it is a concern, how have they adjusted their underwriting assumptions for unexpected emerging and popular therapies that are often classified as specialty drugs (such as GLP-1s)?

GLP-1s are driving 29% of the total increase in drug spending for employers and are top of mind for WriteWise and their customers. Employers are reacting not only to hard costs increases, but also potential legal / regulatory pressure as employers face lawsuits from their employees.

More broadly, your question touches on an important point. Rx underwriting is fundamentally different from healthcare services.

Rx risk is SKU-level and repeatable, so WriteWise can underwrite it like a warranty with much less variance than ER visits or surgeries. Unlike medical procedures, which vary by provider and coding, a drug’s cost and utilization pattern are precise and standardized. There is also a difference in underwriting GLP-1 spend ($20k for 15-20% eligible employees) vs. rare disease ($500K for <1% of eligible population). WriteWise underwrites both of those programs differently (high-frequency vs. catastrophic events).

Regardless, this question gets at the specific techniques that WriteWise uses to underwrite and why the methodology is differentiated (in addition to the 86M+ historical claims they have internally).

Pipeline-aware forecast. MavRx’s trend engine ingests FDA approval calendars, IQVIA launch data and real-time utilization signals from the 80 M-claim warehouse

Quarterly “variance scans” – claims are re-scored every 90 days so employers can see alerts and make changes

Clinical steerage levers. Every guarantee is paired with formulary and prior-auth rules (Tirzepatide after ≥5 % weight-loss failure, 90-day re-auth, coupon maximizer) that can drive results if variance is detected.

Understanding it's very early, have the cohorts they priced so far performed within expected loss ratios (i.e. have they made any underwriting profit, or reasonably/explainably avoided underwriting losses)?

The live cohorts are highly profitable at current pricing. Incurred drug claims are running ~10% of collected premium, and the combined operating ratio (claims + admin) sits around 30%, well below the 80-85% level a carrier would target. WriteWise prices each claim at true post-rebate cost, the model may even be conservative (e..g, over-pricing relative to risk) leaving room to tighten rates while still retaining margin.

### Commercial traction / GTM Qs

Could you, high-level, walk through which customers and products have contributed to the $2.9M in signed ARR to date

PMPM Guarantee. $2.15M ARR 67% gross margin. Five MGA-sponsored groups (TridentMajorMed, TridentMEC, Clearshare, Excel Health, Health-in-Tech) covering 13k employees and 24k members. Average WriteWise fee is $7.46 PMPM, which lands as pure software margin because the MGA holds the stop-loss risk.

RxProtect. $230K ARR, 100% Gross Margin. Six employers (Bayonne & WNY school districts, Techsmith, Load Trail, North Hudson, Andex); 2.6K employees, 6.3K members. All risk is ceded to SiriusPoint, so WriteWise keeps a full underwriting fee.

SubscriptionRx. $560K ARR, 50% gross margin. Eight small-group customers (e.g., MonsieurTeton, Benefits Architects, MyFreeMeds captive) with 2.6k employees and 5.3k members. PEPM ranges $6–$20 depending on tier.

High level, which customer channels/products you expect will drive the majority of growth toward your year-end ARR targets (i.e., which customer base and product interest is driving the $10.3M in pipeline)

The pipeline covers 63K employees (119k total members) and the $10.3M is in addition to the $2.9M ARR already signed.

The pipeline shows WriteWise moving beyond the MGA channel. On the SaaS side ($2.0 M ARR), 13 transparent-PBMs and broker platforms (MedImpact, Navitus, SmithRx, and multi-office agency IOA) are in the pipeline. Each brings a minimum commitment of 15 000 eligible employees and can push multiple employer RFPs through the MavRx portal, compounding licence ARR and underwriting leads.

The Subscription pipeline ($5.5 M ARR) is anchored by association and PEO roll-outs. These deals arrive in bulk rather than one-off groups, giving WW high visibility on revenue.

Considering the focus on decreasing PBM rebates/spread pricing, I believe Writewise can only sell to wholesale PBMs (not the PBM industry broadly). Is this a concern/advantage for the company?

WriteWise has plenty of room to run in the small/mid-sized market (<25-50K employees) that transparent PBMs play in today, transparent PBMs are competing (and winning) against the Big 3 PBMs (CareMark, ExpressScripts, OptumRx) to move up market, and big 3 PBMs are being forced to respond to market demands and become more transparent themselves. This maps nicely to the company's evolution over the next 3-5 years as they grow with the market and continue to go upstream.

Small/mid-size market size. There are ~100M people in the US working at firms with <20,000 employees. WriteWise has shown to-date that they can scale within this under-penetrated market segment without hand-to-hand combat given how they incentivize many of their partners/customers in the employer ecosystem (MGU, MGA, PBM, broker, TPA, etc)

Transparent PBMs are moving upstream. Historically, transparent PBMs have found success with mid-sized employers that haven’t gotten the same attention from the Big 3. However, over the last 3 years many of these transparent PBMs have begun to compete and win business against the big 3 in multiple RFPs. CapitalRx, for example, displaced OptumRx at Rice University and is raising a $300M crossover round before going public to continue its scale.

BIg 3 PBMs are changing (CVS example). Traditional PBMs, such as CVS Caremark and ExpressScripts, have been pushed over the last 3-5 years to respond to employer demands for more transparency. CVS Caremark launched the CostVantage model, which sets costs using a formula based on drug cost, a set markup and a fee for pharmacy services. Express Scripts’ ClearNetwork programs convert brand drugs to cost + markup + fee formulas as well. This trend will continue for the Big 3 PBMs over time, but as mentioned above, WriteWise has plenty of room to run in the small-mid sized market in the meantime.

### Future Growth Drivers and Expansion Opportunities Qs

Can you walk us through, high-level, WriteWise's plans to expand beyond specialty pharmacy?

WriteWise has no plans today to expand beyond specialty drugs - US PBM spend is $500B+. They do, however, want to expand from specialty drugs under the pharmacy benefit (think oral drugs, self-injectables) to specialty drugs under the medical benefit (think drugs administered in provider’s offices). There are multiple $1B outcomes in specialty pharmacy broadly and it is one of the more acquisitive markets in healthcare.

Does WriteWise directly own the employer client relationships, or are they intermediated through brokers/TPAs/PBMs? Is this a concern/advantage for the company?

It’s an advantage given WriteWise understanding and positioning in market. WriteWise sells primarily through brokers, TPAs, and a panel of transparent-PBMs, but still contracts directly with the employer-plan sponsor. Importantly, WriteWise gets to access important data which the plan sponsor technically owns.

These channel sales are an advantage for a team like WriteWise that uniquely understands the dynamics of the space. Brokers already own the employer relationships, which reduces CAC and reduces sales cycle. Despite the channel sales, WriteWise receives the raw claims feed and is the system of record for Rx analytics. If the employer switches brokers, WriteWise is still embedded. WriteWise also has multiple entry points so they have less single channel dependency than a typical channel driven sales model.

Does the company maintain any of the direct specialty pharmacy relationships themselves or is it managed through their PBM partners? Is this a concern/advantage for the company?

Those relationships are handled through the PBM partners and a feature, not a bug. In the specialty pharmacy value chain, the manufacturer sells to a licensed specialty pharmacy, the pharmacy dispenses and earns a fixed handling fee, and the PBM sets the net price the employer ultimately pays by negotiating rebates and discounts with the manufacturer. WW focuses where the price is actually determined at the PBM contract level. Owning or contracting directly with a specialty pharmacy would add operating complexity (warehousing, cold-chain, state licensure) without a ton of margin uplift (specialty pharmacy dispensing fee is $10-$15 for drugs $20K+ / year).

WW wants to stay pharmacy agnostic to focus on where the margin sits (contract/pricing negotiations with employers) and stay asset-light as PBM pricing evolves.
