**The Problem: When a Person Hears the “C” Word**

**PATIENT**
Desperation and Fear
(Icon of a person with a heart symbol)

*   Patients and caregivers rush online and conduct their own cancer “research” but nearly **1 in 3** articles give harmful information*. People are **53%** more likely to engage with articles that are **MISLEADING!**

*   When a patient believes misinformation, they make poor decisions which delays treatment and **increases mortality by 1.2%-3.2% per WEEK.**\*\*

*   Oncology misinformation **erodes** patient and physician **trust** and leads to harmful outcomes.

## Slide 3: Medical Misinformation – A Global Health Crisis

**Platter HEALTH Logo**

**Medical Misinformation – A Global Health Crisis**

“The deluge of conflicting information, misinformation and manipulated information on social media should be recognized as a global public-health threat.”
-Heidi J. Larson Nature 562, 309 (2018)

**Potentially Harmful**

I’m giving him **fenben, cbd oil, Curcumin, vitamin C**. For the last month I’ve been giving him 222mg of fenben. Should I continue with this dosage. He’s very anemic and I nearly lost him this past Tuesday evening as his hemoglobin was at 3. Any help or suggestions?

It’s a waste of time discussing these sorts of things with regular oncologists

It’s not the chemo! I’m betting on the alternative remedies! Imagine how much better she’d be had she refused chemo

**DIAGNOSIS:**
**A. Lymph node, 4R, EBUS guided fine needle aspiration:**
Positive for malignant cells— small cell carcinoma

**B. Lymph node. 4L, EBUS guided fine needle aspiration:**
Positive for malignant cells small cell carcinoma
Please see note below

**C. Lymph node, level VII, EBUS guided fine needle aspiration:**
Scant atypical cells suspicious but not diagnostic of malignancy
Electronically signed by Clara Jones MD on 7/6/2021 at 1423

**DIAGNOSIS: LUNG CANCER**

**Note:**
Note 4L lymph node: By immunohistochemical stains, the cells are positive for pankeratin and neuroendocrine markers synaptophysin and CD56. Findings support the above diagnosis.

Case reviewed by one or more members of the Department, in part or in its entirety.

Stat evaluation: 4R node- positive for malignant cells poorly differentiated carcinoma (by BCT to Dr. Kobayashi)

The initial idea was to help patients reduce fear, anxiety and desperation by creating a “Trusted Search Engine” that would steer them away from cancer misinformation.

**Upgrade 1.0:** Use NLP to read pathology and radiology reports to inform patients where to search

**Upgrade 2.0:** Use NLP & AI to read pathology and radiology reports to create a patient specific search to only credible information

**Upgrade 3.0:** Use the information from the reports and the search to create a shareable “Platter Report”

All regimens are charged equal ($1M/year) and randomly assigned on each Platter Report. The majority of cancer regimens contain at least 2-3 drugs. We are assuming only 1.5 drugs would pay in each regimen (conservative). Every cancer has 4 stages (1 is early 4 is metastatic)
