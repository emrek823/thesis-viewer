Intuitive Surgical Inc (NASDAQ:ISRG) reported strong financial performance for 2024, with a 17% growth in revenue and a 29% increase in net income over 2023.

The company successfully launched its fifth-generation multiport platform, da Vinci 5, with 362 systems placed in 2024 and over 32,000 procedures performed.

Procedure growth was robust, with a 17% increase overall, driven by strong performance in general surgery in the US and regional growth in countries like the UK, Japan, and Germany.

The Ion and da Vinci SP platforms showed significant growth, with Ion procedures increasing by 78% and SP procedures by 72% for the full year.

Intuitive Surgical Inc (NASDAQ:ISRG) improved its pro forma gross margin by 100 basis points to 69.1% and achieved a pro forma operating margin of 37% for 2024.

Bariatric procedures in the US declined modestly due to the rise in GLP-1 medications, impacting overall procedure growth.

The company anticipates lower pro forma operating margins in 2025 due to higher leasing rates, increased depreciation expenses, and a higher mix of lower-margin products.

Challenges in the Chinese market persist, with procedure growth slightly below the corporate average due to domestic competition and government activities.

European markets, particularly the UK and Germany, face ongoing government budget pressures affecting healthcare capital spending.

Intuitive Surgical Inc (NASDAQ:ISRG) expects a significant increase in depreciation expense in 2025 due to new facility openings and manufacturing expansions.

Q: US system placements grew significantly in the second half of 2024. Is this a leading indicator of more procedures, or will there be a digestion period to restore normal utilization?A: Gary Guthart, CEO: As we reach the back half of adoption curves, expectations for utilization may differ, with not every account being high-volume. New capital features can also influence acquisition timing, creating ripples in utilization. Over time, multiport utilization growth rates may settle, while SP and Ion utilization have room to grow.

Q: The gross margin guidance for 2025 seems lower than expected. Can you explain the drivers from 2024 to 2025 and the path back to 70%?A: Jamie Samath, CFO: The main drivers are increased depreciation expense, product mix with da Vinci 5, Ion, and SP, and FX impacts. Depreciation accounts for about 1 point of the 160-point delta. Over the midterm, we aim to exceed 70% gross margin through leveraging scale, improving product margins, and routine cost reductions.

Q: How are you thinking about the mix of da Vinci 5 versus Xi going forward, especially with the upcoming full launch and trade-in cycle?A: Gary Guthart, CEO: The broad launch depends on supply chain readiness and global clearances. The upgrade cycle will be driven by the differential value of da Vinci 5 features. Xi remains a capable system, and refurbished Xi could open opportunities in capital-sensitive markets.

Q: Can you provide an update on the capital equipment environment globally, particularly in China?A: Jamie Samath, CFO: The environment in China remains challenging due to domestic competition and government activities. In the US, capital interest is strong, partly due to da Vinci 5. Challenges persist in the UK and Germany, with some delays in Japan due to financial pressures.

Q: With R&D spending over $1 billion, what are the medium-term investment opportunities, and are there new green spaces to explore?A: Gary Guthart, CEO: Opportunities exist in extending existing platforms, developing new platforms, and expanding indications geographically. We balance investments across these areas, focusing on innovation that meets customer needs and opens new markets.
