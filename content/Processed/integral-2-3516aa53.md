Default is to not raise, I just want to be prepared

Shubh: Specific feedback

Very tactically - talking to Mike and the attention on seed and that we are coming out of stealth. From PR there seems to be interest

The reason why we exist

$B of data can actually be used

3+B records of data processed - we enable this swath of use cases downstream

We’re not just compliance -> data enablement

What is getting you excited

Use cases that we power are getting me excited with LR and PL

I’m realizing customers are also frustrated by Mirador, a $100M revenue business

Powering decisions for execs vs. mid-level data scientists only. Powerful

Essence of value prop

Enabling speed

Effectively unlocking new use cases Initial value is always cost reduction - what can you do now? I have all these things that I wanted to do

How are you measuring the element of speed?

Case study with LiveRamp

Quantitative information

Komodo wants to build a joint product - what does that look like?

Komodo - make us their certifications on the fly layer. End game has to be to jump into pharma. It makes sense for us to be directly in pharma. They are in the game as getting as much data as possible

Initial GTM was pseudo-white labeled

What is happening now is that pharma knows who the compliance provider and we are embedded

Partnerships

Compliance enables data to be free

PL - launching Integral into one of their tenants of their clients. Bridge so that client can bring in PL data, use that for analytics

Facilitating data exchange - buying data in Integral. People are manually integrating - we power data transfers. Price it in a way to power the data exchange

Analytics

LR - wants to directly edit data in our platform. They can get edit it during the compliance and they can work their data on insight

Building complementary features

Why does Integral become a leader in healthcare data enablement?

Why you?

Highest stickiness product that no one is automating

Starting with the largest players (pharma, facilitating data exchanges) takes the hardest part of the ecosystem

What are your unfair advantages?

We we weren’t first, but first in a unique way

Know a unsexy space

Product execution

We are data enablement layer

We’ve automated compliance

We enable new use cases. Examples include:

Customer scheduled for Q3 - DeepIntent

Healthcare marketing - exact use case we power is dynamic ad placement determined by DI ML’s algos. This is where you should put your ad. Empirical evidence we are

Dynamically - you technically can but they can’t afford from a commercial perspective
