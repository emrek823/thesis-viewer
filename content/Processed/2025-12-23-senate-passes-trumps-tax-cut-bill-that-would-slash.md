WASHINGTON — The Senate passed a $4.5 trillion tax-cut bill after last-minute changes to its health care provisions, as Republicans scrambled to get their party on board. The legislation that passed on Tuesday includes major federal funding cuts to Medicaid that were opposed by hospitals and doctors and would sharply boost the number of people without health insurance.

The vote was 51-50, with all Democrats and Republican Sens. Rand Paul (Ky.), Susan Collins (Maine), and Thom Tillis (N.C.) opposed. Vice President JD Vance cast the tie-breaking vote.

The bill’s passage, after more than 24 straight hours of amendments and debate, is a major victory for President Trump and Senate Majority Leader John Thune.
