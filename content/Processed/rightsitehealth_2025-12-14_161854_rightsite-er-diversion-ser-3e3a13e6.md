## Slide 2: The Problem, The Gap, The Solution

RIGHT SITE
For non-emergency patients

## The Problem: Avoidable Emergency Care
Many of United members' ambulance trips and ER visits are avoidable and could be better addressed in other settings, with better outcomes for all concerned.

United made public its 2019 findings that as many as 2/3rds of ER visits are avoidable. The 911/EMS system is built to respond with an expensive care path that includes an ambulance ride, an ER visit, and sometimes an admission, all of which are avoidable for low-acuity cases. These cases end up in the 911/EMS system, and this expensive care path is due to numerous health literacy and social determinants of health factors. These avoidable events lead to unnecessary utilization and quality impacts.

## The Gap: Current Interventions Aren't Working Well Enough
Despite existing patient engagement, care management, analytics, and vendor programs, too many avoidable 911/EMS cases continue down this expensive care path.

## The Solution: RightSite
RightSite gives United a scalable way to intervene. We intercept members inside the 911 event, in real time, and guide them to faster, lower-cost care with exceptionally high patient satisfaction rates. Our ER physicians treat a wide range of low-acuity conditions via telehealth, and our patient navigators solve the health literacy and SDOH issues that often drive these calls. When needed, we coordinate urgent care visits, schedule PCP and other provider appointments, provide in-home Rx or ride-share transportation, and otherwise bridge barriers to more effective and efficient care.

For non-emergent 911 callers, RightSite physicians have diverted more than 87% of United's members from the ER, prevented more than 95% of ambulance calls, and avoided 8% of unnecessary inpatient admissions.

RightSite's Navigators stay with the member for 7 days to resolve the health literacy and SDOH issues that triggered the 911 call, and to keep the patient out of 911/EMS and the ER. They reach more than 70% of members, which is multiple times higher than typical health-plan or vendor reach rates.

## Slide 3: Who Is RightSite

RIGHT SITE
For non-emergency patients

All these advantages come with clean patient attribution, simple auto-adjudication of claims, RightSite taking full-risk for the services they provide, and no campaigns are needed to create patient adoption.

## Who Is RightSite
RightSite works inside the 911 system to redirect non-emergent callers to faster, safer, lower-cost care. Our ER physicians treat patients in real time, and our navigators resolve the health literacy and SDOH issues that often drive repeat use.

This approach reduces avoidable ambulance trips, ER visits, and admissions, while giving payers a savings stream that is immediate, cleanly attributed, and simple to administer. You can learn more about us at RightSiteHealth.com.

## Slide 4: Why RightSite-Generated Savings Look Different

RIGHT SITE
For non-emergency patients

## Why RightSite-Generated Savings Look Different

### Burden-free implementation. Immediate savings.
*   Unlike programs that require United to stand up complicated contracting models, run expensive analytics, or invest in other internal operations, RightSite produces real-time savings for each encounter the moment 911/EMS calls are diverted.
*   Because United does not have to spend on people, assets, IT, implementation, or new systems, the cost to achieve value through RightSite is lower than other savings initiatives.

### Attribution without ambiguity. Auto-adjudicated. Full risk.
*   RightSite delivers clean attribution through a provider contract and simple auto-adjudication, making savings easy to measure and pay.
*   RightSite's unique position as the sole provider treating patients during an active 911 call ensures unambiguous attribution.
*   Case rates are paid solely for diversion, and RightSite assumes full risk for the services it delivers to treat, manage, and divert the case.

### No member behavior change required.
*   The patient meets RightSite the moment 911/EMS calls us in, so we do not need member outreach or behavior change to create impact.

### Additional value creation.
*   RightSite can also serve as a referral source into United's internal and vendor programs to intercept complex or hard-to-engage members who enter through 911 and are seen by RightSite, creating additional value at no extra cost to United.
