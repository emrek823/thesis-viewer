**Created:** 2026-01-06T21:32:21.573Z
**Updated:** 2026-01-06T22:04:05.555Z

### Demetri’s Transition & Personal Update

- Recently completed exit from 30 Madison (9-year journey, announced September, closed October)
- Company fully integrated into acquisition (not division), no longer needed CEO
- Last day January 3rd, first time truly off work since 2017
- Taking Q1 off completely - Dubai bachelor party trip, Mexico for 6 weeks with family
	- New baby boy, 5 months old
	- Wife also has early-stage company
- Planning return to work in April after recovery period

### Future Plans & Entrepreneurial Outlook

- Considering second company (previously sold first company early in cycle)
- 40-50% of ideas still in digital healthcare space vs other sectors
- Prefers building/early-stage challenges over running large organizations
	- Missed product-market fit phase vs managing hundreds of employees
	- Wants to return to foundational building rather than executive management
- Open to healthcare but not locked in - exploring various opportunities
- Plans organic approach similar to how 30 Madison emerged from multiple ideas

### AI Impact on Healthcare & Market Dynamics

- Technical barrier to entry dramatically lowered - can build “good enough” products faster
- Industry buyers (providers/payers) evolved significantly:
	- Initially tried building AI internally, realized complexity
	- Now receiving 20+ AI vendor pitches regularly
- Younger, AI-native founders have advantage over incumbents despite data/distribution assets
- Speed of iteration allows 2-year execution of previously 5-10 year visions
- Market flooded with shallow AI applications vs deep domain expertise solutions

### Collaboration & Next Steps

- Mutual interest in brainstorming sessions during Demetri’s exploration phase
- Virtue team offered research support and thesis development assistance
- Plan to reconnect when Demetri returns in April
- Sean traveling to NYC end of January, Demetri in NYC Tuesdays/Thursdays
- Michelle sends regards, suggested founder-to-founder connection with Demetri’s wife

### Fincura Company Overview & Product Strategy

- Tim Schuermer, founder with 10 years FinTech experience at OnDeck (Series A to post-IPO)
- Family background in privately owned dental/medical practices
- Building payments reconciliation starting with EFT-centric approach
	- Bank account as core source of truth/immutable layer
	- Plaid API connector sits on top of bank accounts
	- Listens for insurance payments hitting accounts, then solves EOB problem
- Strategic positioning: going deeper into fintech stack vs up RCM stack
	- Believes upper RCM will commoditize (normalized data, becomes distribution game)
	- Natural extension: insurance payments → patient payment collection → full AR/AP visibility
- Competing against “PDFs, pen and people” rather than other venture-backed companies
- Current customers: targeting 1.1M independently owned practices vs PE/hospital systems

### Business Model & ROI

- Pricing: 1.75% per location (example: 3-location dental group at $300K/month each = ~$50K ACV per location)
- ROI drivers for practices:
	- Productivity: replaces 1-1.5 FTE per site doing payments posting ($40-75K wage cost)
	- Float optimization: practices typically have only 1-2 weeks liquidity despite $3.5-10M revenues
- Explored pre-funding insurance claims concept
	- Different banks treat EFTs differently (Citi T+1, Wells Fargo T+3)
	- Provider price elasticity around 25-75 basis points for acceleration
	- Asset quality strong but pricing thin
	- Requires $100M+ facility to be compelling

### Go-to-Market & Funding

- Sales strategy: founder-led for next 24 months, targeting SMBs exclusively
- Distribution channels:
- Sales cycle: Monday call → Tuesday following week contract signed
- Target: 50-100M+ monthly payment processing, $500K-1M monthly revenue on seed alone
- Funding: just kicked off seed raise yesterday, looking for right partner not just capital
- Data room ready, flexible on timing (3 days to couple weeks acceptable)

### Next Steps

- Sean and Emre: internal huddle, respond end of week/early next week
- Potential second call (60 minutes) if first call successful
- Tim: available for async follow-ups, product demos, data room access

	- Plaid API connector sits on top of bank accounts
	- Listens for insurance payments hitting accounts, then solves EOB problem
- Strategic positioning: going deeper into fintech stack vs up RCM stack
	- Believes upper RCM will commoditize (normalized data, becomes distribution game)
	- Natural extension: insurance payments → patient payment collection → full AR/AP visibility
- Competing against “PDFs, pen and people” rather than other venture-backed companies
- Current customers: targeting 1.1M independently owned practices vs PE/hospital systems

### Business Model & ROI

- Pricing: 1.75% per location (example: 3-location dental group at $300K/month each = ~$50K ACV per location)
- ROI drivers for practices:
	- Productivity: replaces 1-1.5 FTE per site doing payments posting ($40-75K wage cost)
	- Float optimization: practices typically have only 1-2 weeks liquidity despite $3.5-10M revenues
- Explored pre-funding insurance claims concept
	- Different banks treat EFTs differently (Citi T+1, Wells Fargo T+3)
	- Provider price elasticity around 25-75 basis points for acceleration
	- Asset quality strong but pricing thin
	- Requires $100M+ facility to be compelling

### Go-to-Market & Funding

- Sales strategy: founder-led for next 24 months, targeting SMBs exclusively
- Distribution channels:
- Sales cycle: Monday call → Tuesday following week contract signed
- Target: 50-100M+ monthly payment processing, $500K-1M monthly revenue on seed alone
- Funding: just kicked off seed raise yesterday, looking for right partner not just capital
- Data room ready, flexible on timing (3 days to couple weeks acceptable)

### Next Steps

- Sean and Emre: internal huddle, respond end of week/early next week
- Potential second call (60 minutes) if first call successful
- Tim: available for async follow-ups, product demos, data room access

	- Believes upper RCM will commoditize (normalized data, becomes distribution game)
	- Natural extension: insurance payments → patient payment collection → full AR/AP visibility
- Competing against “PDFs, pen and people” rather than other venture-backed companies
- Current customers: targeting 1.1M independently owned practices vs PE/hospital systems

### Business Model & ROI

- Pricing: 1.75% per location (example: 3-location dental group at $300K/month each = ~$50K ACV per location)
- ROI drivers for practices:
	- Productivity: replaces 1-1.5 FTE per site doing payments posting ($40-75K wage cost)
	- Float optimization: practices typically have only 1-2 weeks liquidity despite $3.5-10M revenues
- Explored pre-funding insurance claims concept
	- Different banks treat EFTs differently (Citi T+1, Wells Fargo T+3)
	- Provider price elasticity around 25-75 basis points for acceleration
	- Asset quality strong but pricing thin
	- Requires $100M+ facility to be compelling

### Go-to-Market & Funding

- Sales strategy: founder-led for next 24 months, targeting SMBs exclusively
- Distribution channels:
- Sales cycle: Monday call → Tuesday following week contract signed
- Target: 50-100M+ monthly payment processing, $500K-1M monthly revenue on seed alone
- Funding: just kicked off seed raise yesterday, looking for right partner not just capital
- Data room ready, flexible on timing (3 days to couple weeks acceptable)

### Next Steps

- Sean and Emre: internal huddle, respond end of week/early next week
- Potential second call (60 minutes) if first call successful
- Tim: available for async follow-ups, product demos, data room access

**Created:** 2026-01-06T21:32:21.573Z
**Updated:** 2026-01-06T22:04:05.555Z

### Demetri’s Transition & Personal Update

- Recently completed exit from 30 Madison (9-year journey, announced September, closed October)
- Company fully integrated into acquisition (not division), no longer needed CEO
- Last day January 3rd, first time truly off work since 2017
- Taking Q1 off completely - Dubai bachelor party trip, Mexico for 6 weeks with family
	- New baby boy, 5 months old
	- Wife also has early-stage company
- Planning return to work in April after recovery period

### Future Plans & Entrepreneurial Outlook

- Considering second company (previously sold first company early in cycle)
- 40-50% of ideas still in digital healthcare space vs other sectors
- Prefers building/early-stage challenges over running large organizations
	- Missed product-market fit phase vs managing hundreds of employees
	- Wants to return to foundational building rather than executive management
- Open to healthcare but not locked in - exploring various opportunities
- Plans organic approach similar to how 30 Madison emerged from multiple ideas

### AI Impact on Healthcare & Market Dynamics

- Technical barrier to entry dramatically lowered - can build “good enough” products faster
- Industry buyers (providers/payers) evolved significantly:
	- Initially tried building AI internally, realized complexity
	- Now receiving 20+ AI vendor pitches regularly
- Younger, AI-native founders have advantage over incumbents despite data/distribution assets
- Speed of iteration allows 2-year execution of previously 5-10 year visions
- Market flooded with shallow AI applications vs deep domain expertise solutions

### Collaboration & Next Steps

- Mutual interest in brainstorming sessions during Demetri’s exploration phase
- Virtue team offered research support and thesis development assistance
- Plan to reconnect when Demetri returns in April
- Sean traveling to NYC end of January, Demetri in NYC Tuesdays/Thursdays
- Michelle sends regards, suggested founder-to-founder connection with Demetri’s wife
