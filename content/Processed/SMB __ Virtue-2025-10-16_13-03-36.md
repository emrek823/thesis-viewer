### Sanofi Partnership Progress

- Deal structure finalized - wrap up before Halloween
	- Pilot: $300K to enable press release (next 1-2 weeks)
	- Main contract: $800K per therapeutic area × 6 areas = $4.8M total
	- Combined value: $5.1M total deal
	- Budget approval: November 7th, expects positive outcome
- Galen’s approach: no paper documentation until screen share negotiation
- Press release strategy: Kevin to send draft, Galen committed to fast turnaround
- Risk management: avoiding outrageous POC expectations
- Quant Health update: sidelined to $500K pilot only
	- Sanofi Ventures needed to spend capital quickly
	- Proceeding despite internal objections

### Big Pharma Business Development

- BMS opportunities and challenges:
	- Quant Health has $250K pilot with BMS
	- Need right-level entry point - current contacts too junior
	- Target contacts for JPM:
		- Simon Davies (Data Science/Biostats lead, reports to Christian)
		- Christian (new CMO, actively seeking foundational models)
	- Competitive landscape: Tempest quoted $11M (BMS balked at price)
	- Mateo (Head of Development IT): cut $35M from Concert AI business
- AstraZeneca: foot in door, need to formalize relationship over time
- J&J: David getting “too cool for school” - coffee meeting planned
- GSK: targeting Kim Branson through Shane connection (Lumiata co-founder)

### Academic Medical Center Data Strategy

- Current partnerships in progress:
	- MGH/Harvard/Dana Farber: multimodal foundation model collaboration
	- Yale: similar multimodal project
	- Mount Sinai: whole exome sequencing partnership with data access
	- UCSD: partnership would include data component
	- King’s College London: engagement ongoing
- MD Anderson developments:
	- 3 active projects, increasing urgency from their side
	- Asked SMB for grant letter support (now public discussion approved)
	- Future data licensing opportunity (they license to others)
	- Unique access to rigorous benchmarking datasets
- MSK engagement in pipeline
- Vanderbilt/Nash imaging opportunities

### Technical Partnerships and Competitive Position

- OpenAI partnership evaluation:
	- Potential benefits: free compute, superior fine-tuning optimization
	- Best-in-class reinforcement learning stack (“press button” functionality)
	- Could enhance Sanofi deliverables and scale
	- Investor perception: likely net positive to quite positive
- Competitive threats:
	- Periodic Labs and Lila Sciences raised significant funding
	- Risk: someone raises $300M and gains massive head start
	- Need to balance urgency without FOMO-driven decisions
- Technical strength: papers generating strong interest from top labs
	- Fabian Tyson lab researcher: “was thinking of starting company to do this, but you guys look awesome”

### Fundraising Strategy and Timeline

- Series A planning: $30M target range
- Current runway: 38 months if only Sanofi deal closes (no other revenue)
- Ideal state for fundraising:
	- Pharma: Sanofi signed + AstraZeneca formalized + BMS contract
	- AMCs: Yale and MGH partnerships confirmed, strong logo portfolio
	- Technical: continued paper publications, talent attraction
- Market dynamics: Series A deals increasingly preempted (3 recent examples)
- Timing considerations:
	- Wait for Sanofi press release before broad outreach
	- Target 8-10 select firms for relationship building
	- JPM meetings critical for BMS breakthrough
- Investor profile sought: aggressive, believes in broad biomedical AI vision vs. narrow niche approach
