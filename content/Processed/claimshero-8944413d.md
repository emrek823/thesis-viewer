SUMMARY OVERVIEW

## Slide 2: Overview

confidential

# Overview

*   Health Insurance denials remain a massive and opaque problem (17% of all claims denied).
*   Almost nobody appeals (0.1-0.2%).
*   This has consequences on both the health and economics of minorities, and low income people in the US.
*   It is also driving consolidation of healthcare resources as smaller systems collapse.
*   Driven by generative AI, we have identified the opening to rebalance the system.
*   ClaimsHero is an automated agent to appeal denied claims on behalf of Patients and Providers.

## Slide 4: Getting to the Point

# Getting to the Point

**[Funnel Chart Data]**
*   **Total Claims per year:** 5 Billion
*   **Denied (17%):** 850 million
*   **EVER appealed (0.2%):** 1.7 million

*   Denial rate varies geographically, from 4% in North Dakota to 24% in Hawaii. ^1
*   States that expanded medicaid have lower denial rates.
*   ~65% of denied claims are never re-submitted by Physicians. Loss is priced into commercial rates. ^2
*   Few appeals are ever made, those which are have a 45%-60% chance of being approved.
*   People most impacted likely to be minorities and have economic hardship.
*   Denied care and mounting bills lead to worsening poverty and widening outcome disparities.

Remember: The people who DO appeal are quite likely unwell and have 180 days to do so. Payors have 30-60 days legally to respond.

## Slide 5: Cited Reasons for Denials

# Cited Reasons for Denials

**[Pie Chart Data]**
*   **All Other Reasons:** 76%
*   **Excluded Service:** 14%
*   **Lack of Prior Auth:** 8%
*   **Not Medically Necessary:** 2%
*   **Out of Network:** 1%

Best Case: Payors use AI for approvals, and human review for denials. This is NOT uniformly true.

## Slide 6: Another Problem: Access is Getting Worse

confidential

# Another Problem: Access is Getting Worse

*   Since Covid-19, Fee-For-Service health systems have struggled to maintain liquidity.
*   Cost of wages have increased, however, reimbursement rates rises are fought by the Payors.
*   "Medicaid Safety Net Hospitals" rely on revenue cycle to maintain operations. Many are closing.
*   Safety Nets support low income communities, if they close access diminishes, and costs rise. ^1
*   In this case, monopoly health systems dominate insurance markets pushing up vertical cost trends in commercial insurance.
