## Slide 3: Identified Health Data the Future
**Identified Health Data is 10x More Valuable than De-identified Data.**

**Identified Data: $150 to $300 per Patient**
* Enables direct patient-level action
* Clear provenance
* Clearly measurable ROI
* Rich data model

**De-Identified Data: $0.01 to $10**
* Limited to population analysis
* Unclear provenance
* Hard to measure outcomes
* Limited data profile

*   De-Identified Data: $1B
*   Linkable De-Identified Patient Data: $2B
*   Identified Patient Data Today: $12B
*   Future Identified Patient Data: $200B

## Slide 5: Why Now?
**The De-identified World does not Understand Identified Use Cases**
**The Identified World does not know the De-identified World Exists**

**These Two Worlds are Setup to Merge**

| De-Identified World (2010-2025)                                 | Identified World                                                                 |
| :-------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Built comfort exchanging health data across 1,000+ sources    | Largely unaware that health data can be traded or licensed                     |
| Market is mature; data is commoditized                          | Still rely on fax and manual record requests                                     |
| Growth pressure is creating push for new markets and use cases | Few know how to license or value health data                                     |
| Limited knowledge of use cases that require identified health data – this was intentional as cultural norm | Early APIs from Epic, Athena, Office Ally, Waystar are creating data liquidity |
|                                                                 | However the market lack technical acuity to implement                            |

## Slide 6: Problem: Identified Data is Stuck in the Past
**Access to Identified Data is Fragmented, Full of Friction, and Labor Intensive**

**The Problem**
HIEs and TEFCA were designed to enable seamless health data exchange but in practice, its made it worse.

Access to identified data is still full of friction.
* **Fragmentation:** 1,000+ data custodians with limited footprint and coverage.
* **Friction:** Labor cost of $100 to pull one medical record
* **Confusion:** Varying channels to get medical records: fax, bespoke requestor portals, and limited APIs.

**Diagram: Fragmented Data Access Network**
(Illustrates a network of various entities with tangled, non-direct connections)
*   Patient Registry
*   CRO
*   Health Plan
*   Clinic
*   EHR
*   Claims
*   Hospital
*   ROI
*   Imaging
*   Law Firm
*   Life Insurance

## Slide 7: Solution: One Network. One API. One Workflow.
**Unlocking Identified Data Requires a Trusted Network that Connects Requestors and Custodians to Reduce Friction, Reduce Turnaround Times, and Enforce Rules.**

| Requestors           | Custodians               |
| :------------------- | :----------------------- |
| Law Firms            | Release of Information   |
| Life Insurance       | Claims Clearinghouses    |
| Health Plans         | EHR Software             |
| CRO’s                | Imaging Software         |
| Healthcare Operations | Hospitals                |
| Patient Registries   | Clinics                  |

**Diagram: Centralized Data Access Network with Hermes Health**

*   Law Firm
*   Life Insurance
*   **HERMES HEALTH** (in the center)

## Slide 8: Network Effect & Value
**Hermes Provides Value to Both the Requestor and the Custodian. Creating a Reinforcing Flywheel effect.**

| Requestor                                                      | Custodian                                                      |
| :------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Faster Turnaround: More Revenue** Data comes back in minutes instead of weeks | **More Demand: More Revenue** Hermes reduces the friction to request and deliver data; inducing demand for the Custodian’s data. |
| **More Data: More Revenue** More data enables Requestors to unlock new markets and use cases. | **Implementation Burden: Less Cost** Hermes handles integrations with Requestors so Custodians don't have to manage one-off tech implementations and maintenance. |
| **Less Overhead: Less Cost** One API to submit and retrieve identified health data no more bespoke connections, integrations, and maintenance. | **Scalable Intake: Less Cost** Requests arrives in a single, standardized format. Unlocking lower operational cost, faster routing, and simplified scaling. |

**Diagram: Hermes Health Flywheel Effect**
*   More Requestors (leads to)
*   More Record Volume (leads to)
*   More Vendors Integrate to Capture Volume (leads to)
*   Faster and Easier Records (leads to)
*   More Requestors

Confidential

## Slide 9: Hermes Access & Delivery Layer
**Our Access and Delivery Layer Connects Requestor to Custodians**

**Access and Delivery Layer**
*   **Intake:** Requestors securely submit patient's full name, date of birth, and a signed HIPAA Authorization form.
*   **Smart Routing:** The Unity Platform then routes these requests to our network of Custodians.
*   **Partner Fulfillment:** Custodians processes these Requests and transmit data back to Hermes
*   **Delivery:** Hermes delivers the data back to Requestors without revealing Custodian specific infrastructure—protecting privacy, and confidentiality
*   **Transparent Pricing:** Custodian is paid on a per-record/patient fee.

**Diagram: Hermes Access & Delivery Workflow**
*   Requestor
    *   Secure Intake
    *   Secure Delivery
*   Hermes Platform (Pre and Post Processing)
    *   API Delivery (output)
    *   Partner Route Engine (output)
*   Partner Route Engine leads to Partner (ROI, EHR, or Claims)
*   Partner (ROI, EHR, or Claims) leads to Facility
*   Patient Data (input to API Delivery)
*   Patient Data Retrieved (output from Facility via Partner)

## Slide 14: The Business Model
**We have a Simple Pricing that Scales as our Network Grows.**

**Business Model**
*   Hermes monetizes the Requestors.
*   Hermes pays the Custodian on a per record or patient basis based on the dataset.
*   Gross margin is the spread between what we charge Requestors and what Partners charge us.
*   As automation and network density grow, gross margins expand.

| Category                    | Price                |
| :-------------------------- | :------------------- |
| Annual Platform             | $10,000 to $100,000  |
| Record Request              | $50 Per Record       |
| Site Sonar                  | $15 Per Patient      |
| HIPAA Checker and Site Finder | $1 Per Call          |
| Smart Router                | $5 per Record        |

*   **2030:** ~$68,000,000

*Y-axis: $0 to $80,000,000*
*X-axis: 2025 to 2030*

## Slide 17: Use of Funds
**Hermes Health's Moat = Network Density × Neutrality × Economies of Scale × Product Velocity**

**Connection Density**
The more custodians Hermes connects to us in each market segment, the less it makes sense for Requestors to build their own links. Add to our network density.

**Neutrality**
Because Hermes doesn't compete with custodians, they're more willing to connect with us than with other networks. Our neutrality builds trust at scale.

**Economies of Scale**
As volume grows, we negotiate better rates from Custodians and pass savings to Requestors driving more usage and reinforcing our lead.

**Products Velocity**
Hermes is constantly building features to make it easier for Custodians and Requestors to facilitate the exchange of the data. This Product velocity enables us to compete with networks of the same of the same size that have lower velocity.

## Slide 22: Partners Can't Be The Center
**Why Can't Partners Be The Center**
*   **Competitive Conflict:** Partners compete with each other, making it difficult for any single partner to act as a neutral hub for all.
*   **Limited Footprint:** Individual partners have a limited footprint on a patient data record. As a result they cannot fulfill all requests.
*   **Trust:** Partners don't trust each other and as a result hesitate to share proprietary information directly with each other, restricting cooperation.
*   **Complex Integration:** Direct connections among multiple partners create costly complexity, duplication, and labor.
