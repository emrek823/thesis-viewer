### BUILDING A FUTURE WITHOUT INHERITED DISEASE

## OUR MISSION

We’re building a future where no child inherits preventable disease. Through safe, ethical gene correction therapies, we give parents a new kind of choice rooted in compassion, guided by science, and governed by care.

### ALLEVIATE SUFFERING

## BEFORE ILLNESS BEGINS

We believe that every parent deserves the chance to give their child the healthiest possible start in life. For too long, inherited genetic conditions have been treated as fate. But with innovative technology and the right ethical guardrails, we can change that.

## TRANSPARENT SCIENCE

We use precision gene correction to address inherited disease at its source, the embryo, before it can affect future generations. All of our work is conducted within the United States, under rigorous regulatory oversight and guided by deep ethical responsibility.

We do not support a permanent global moratorium on germline gene correction. We believe this science can be pursued carefully, transparently, and ethically to prevent unnecessary suffering. Banning the technology isn’t the answer. Building trust is.

We are committed to radical transparency: no secrecy, no shortcuts, and no overpromises
