# Withamma Pre-Call Brief

## 1. Quick Context

**WHO:** Neal Modi (CEO) and JD Pagano (Co-founder). Neal previously worked at Kargo and Lively per the intro email from Prateesh at Maverick. Prateesh describes Neal as "one of my closest friends" with "a great career in building." LinkedIn profiles didn't yield additional detail.

**WHAT:** Amma is an AI-enabled patient advocacy and care coordination platform. They've built an MVP and are getting "great feedback from early patients and nurse navigators."

**WHERE:** Pre-seed, raising $2M, targeting close by end of February 2026. Less than 3 months old. Maverick Capital is looking at the round.

**PRIOR:** First meeting. Intro came from Prateesh Maheshwari at Maverick on Jan 11. Neal shared a deck via Google link that we should review before the call.

## 2. Market Context

**What we know internally:** We have zero similar deals in our vault for patient advocacy or care coordination platforms, which is notable. This is either white space in our portfolio or a category we've historically passed on. The closest thesis fit is likely the "Consumer AI Health Platforms" framework, where the mechanism is that ChatGPT captures 40M daily health queries but can't prescribe, accept liability, or provide care continuity. Physician-in-the-loop companies monetize by bridging AI triage to paid clinical encounters. If Amma is doing AI-assisted care coordination with nurse navigators in the loop, it maps to this model. The bull case from that thesis: companies like Counsel Health show 96% resolution rates with $381 savings per member, and K Health raised $439M proving the category can scale. The bear case: K Health has a 2.2 Trustpilot rating showing execution challenges at scale, and only 39% of Americans trust AI chatbots for healthcare decisions.

The "Healthcare AI Stack" thesis is also relevant. The core mechanism: healthcare AI moats don't come from model quality but from three infrastructure layers: multi-EHR integration breadth, coding/billing ROI capture, and human-in-loop service delivery. If Amma is building care coordination, the question is whether they're integrating deeply into provider workflows or sitting as a standalone consumer tool. The thesis says point solutions without platform expansion face "mass extinction" by 2027. At pre-seed, they need a clear path to one of those three moats.

**Market landscape:** The care coordination and patient navigation space has seen significant activity. Pomelo Care just raised $92M Series C at a $1.7B valuation for maternity care navigation in January 2026. Spring Health raised $100M Series E in mental health. Oshi Health raised $60M Series C for digestive care. The pattern: verticalized, clinically-focused models with clear outcomes are getting funded. The "patient advocacy" framing is fuzzier than these verticals. Amma needs to either pick a vertical (the name suggests maternal/family health) or articulate why horizontal advocacy wins. Accolade is the incumbent in this space at scale. Rightway and Transcarent have raised significant capital for similar navigation plays. The question is whether AI-native approaches can deliver better unit economics than the legacy services companies.

**How this deal fits:**
- **Bull case:** Experienced operators who built an MVP in under 3 months, getting early validation from nurse navigators (the human-in-loop component). Maverick is looking at the round, providing signal. If they can show that AI reduces the cost-per-patient for care coordination by 50%+ versus legacy services models, the unit economics could work. The timing aligns with employer frustration over healthcare costs and benefit complexity.
- **Bear case:** "Patient advocacy" is broad and historically a services business with thin margins. Three months in with no ARR is normal for pre-seed, but we need to understand the path to revenue. The K Health cautionary tale (scaled fast, bad NPS) suggests execution risk. If they're B2C, customer acquisition will be brutal. If they're B2B (employers/payers), sales cycles are 6-12+ months.

## 3. Questions

**1. Walk us through a specific patient journey on Amma today. What triggers engagement, what does the AI handle versus the nurse navigator, and what's the outcome?**
*Context: The intro email says "AI-enabled patient advocacy" but we need to understand the actual product loop and where AI creates leverage versus where humans are required.*

**2. Who is paying? Are you B2B (employers, payers, providers) or B2C, and what's the pricing model?**
*Context: Our Consumer AI thesis says the monetization layer is critical. Counsel Health charges $29-199/year per user. We need to understand Amma's revenue model and whether unit economics can work.*

**3. You mentioned "great feedback from early patients and nurse navigators." Can you quantify that? How many patients, what retention looks like, and what specific metrics are you tracking?**
*Context: At pre-seed, we don't expect ARR, but we need leading indicators. "Great feedback" needs to be unpacked.*

**4. Why patient advocacy broadly versus picking a specific vertical? Pomelo just raised $92M at $1.7B focused specifically on maternity. What's the argument for horizontal?**
*Context: The market is rewarding verticalized plays. We need to understand if Amma plans to go horizontal or if there's a beachhead vertical (the name "Amma" suggests maternal health).*

**5. What did you learn at Kargo and Lively that directly applies to building Amma? What's the specific insight from that experience driving how you're building?**
*Context: Prateesh emphasized Neal's operator background. We need to understand how that experience translates to healthcare specifically.*

**6. What does the nurse navigator workflow look like today? Are you working with existing navigators at employers/payers, or building your own clinical team?**
*Context: Our Healthcare AI Stack thesis says human-in-loop service delivery is one of three moats. We need to understand if they're building clinical ops or plugging into existing infrastructure.*

**7. How do you think about competing with Accolade, Rightway, and Transcarent? What's the AI-native advantage in cost structure or outcomes?**
*Context: These are well-funded incumbents. We need to understand the wedge and whether AI creates 10x better unit economics or just incremental improvement.*

**8. What specific integrations are you building or planning? EHRs, benefits platforms, scheduling systems?**
*Context: Our thesis says healthcare AI moats come from integration depth, not model quality. At pre-seed, we need to see the path to infrastructure lock-in.*

**9. You're aiming to close $2M by end of February. Who else is in the round, and what are the 2-3 milestones that capital needs to unlock?**
*Context: Standard financing question but important to understand timeline pressure and what they're optimizing for.*

**10. What's the biggest thing that could kill this company in the next 18 months?**
*Context: Tests self-awareness and whether they've identified the real risks. For care coordination, it's usually sales cycle length, customer acquisition cost, or clinical quality issues.*

**Key thing to figure out:** Is this a verticalized, AI-native care coordination play with a clear wedge against incumbents and a path to sustainable unit economics, or is it a broad "patient advocacy" services business that will struggle to differentiate?
