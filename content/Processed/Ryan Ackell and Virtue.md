- Virtue: Early stage healthcare focused fund; investing out of Fund 2 ($55M); Fund 1 was $30M with 24 investments
- Focus areas: data, dollars, and delivery of care
- Autonomy represents first investment from Fund 2

### Historical Relationship

- Natalie, Roo and reference have known each other for 10 years
- Natalie trained and provided hand-holding support during reference’s first corporate job at Morgan Stanley
- Both went through PE and VC; Natalie now founding while reference joined Series B startup
- Met Roo through Morgan Stanley group (heavily Duke-focused); he was year above on ECM side
- While investing, spent significant time with Roo on healthcare deals
- Less interaction during AF period due to pure play consumer focus
- Roo became go-to person for comprehensive market understanding
- Sourced significant deal flow from Roo

### Founder Dynamics & Complementary Skills

Roo’s Strengths:

- Big picture thinker - can simultaneously think 5-10 years and 12 months ahead
- Deep research orientation and comprehensive thinking
- Thoroughly does his homework
- Can discuss topics extensively with depth

Natalie’s Strengths:

- Execution-focused - drives getting things done
- Customer-centric approach
- Insanely data-driven - extremely proficient with analysis
- Detail-oriented (example: found hidden redline in customer document during dinner)
- Morgan Stanley background instilled perfection as the standard

### Working Dynamic

- Strong mutual respect in debates
- Both hold strong opinions while valuing opposing viewpoints
- Clear understanding that Roo as CEO makes final decisions
- Create space for meaningful debate while maintaining unity in execution
- Customer-driven approach rather than dogmatic product vision
- Allowed customer feedback to guide focus (e.g. prior authorization emphasis)

### Support Needs & Recommendations

- Engineering leadership (acknowledged gap in technical expertise)
- Clinical background needed (neutral, non-customer clinician)
- Demonstrated capital efficiency - bootstrapped initially
- Built customer validation before raising funds
- Deep focus on being good stewards of capital

### Watch-Out Areas

- Roo needs direction management - channel his excitement and market mapping toward focused outcomes
- Natalie operates at extremes - doesn’t work in middle ground
- Transition from stable TCV position has created adjustment period
- Both aware of these characteristics as areas for development

### Additional Context

- Background from Morgan Stanley, Redesign, TCV provides strong foundation
- Could have raised $2M immediately but chose customer validation first
- Demonstrated commitment through bootstrapping period
- Strong healthcare industry understanding and network
