## Q&#x26;A Section

### Q: Can you compare at least two different utilization management/ prior authorization AI solutions from providers such as Cohere Health, Evicore, Anterior, Milliman Care Guidelines, Availity, or Change Healthcare?
**A:**
- I can speak in create detail about the strengths and weaknesses for all except Anterior - they are not part of our consideration and I can explain shy.

### Q: Are you familiar with the strategic goals and challenges related to utilization management/ prior authorization processes in your organization?
**A:**
- I can speak at great lengths, to why it is imperative for payers to have a strategy for utilization management and frictionless claims and authorization processes.
- I’ll include strategy for government requirements, the lack of adequate data aggregation, etc.
- In addition, I can speak to the need of AI supplemental documentation, the challenges, and the use-cases to test in production.

### Q: Can you speak to the impact of utilization management/ prior authorization AI on your organization's operational efficiency and member experience?
**A:**
- Yes, I have detailed statistics for both payers and providers. I can also elaborate on competitors not listed above who you may want to include in your analysis.

## Client Interaction

**Client:**
Hi, thank you for taking the time to speak with me. For context, I'm trying to understand the AI-driven prior auth software buying market from the payer side. I'm trying to deeper go into the buying cycle like, first of all, understanding what the actual buying cycle is for a typical payer. I would want to segment that by the size, the top ones, and then perhaps the mid-segment.

Going into understanding, is there an urgency right now to consider AI-driven players because of separate budget allocated for the recent years or maybe this year onwards if you've seen that trend, or is there an urgency because there are a lot of new solutions, Cohere, Anterior, etc., in the market? Just trying to understand where the market is right now and what you're hearing across different segments. To start off, I would like to talk a little bit about your background, your experience, and your current role, and then we can go from there.

**Expert:**
Absolutely. It's a very complicated subject. I'm actively engaged very heavily in this subject. If I'm not clear at all, please just stop me and I can restate my answer. Where would you like me to start?

**Client:**
I think I would like to start just understanding the typical buying cycle for such solutions. Let's first discuss like a larger payer and then a mid-segment one like a Blue Cross Blue Shield.

**Expert:**
Absolutely. For any payer to take advantage of the new AI-enabled tool or prior authorization or for utilization management, it really depends on whether they're currently in a cloud environment or if they're on a mainframe. That significantly impacts your ability to transition to new tools. Does that make sense?

**Client:**
Yes. They're in a cloud environment, it's much faster, so their buying cycle is likely to be shorter.

**Expert:**
Absolutely, and for various different reasons. If you are in the cloud, your interoperability, probably your data aggregation, those things are probably in a much better state. If you're on a mainframe, the mainframe...

## Main Text

could take, believe it or not, up to five years or longer to upgrade all of your systems to manage it. On the mainframe side, the decision-making process is years up until including probably three to five years, believe it or not. On the cloud side, I would put it down of a typical 12-36 months of making decisions and being able to change more flexibly.

**Client**
Okay. Even on the cloud side, it's 12-36 months, typically.

**Expert**
Yes. The standard for the industry, it never changes. The processes are long and lengthy. On all payer side, they're typically risk-averse, and these decisions are really hard to make internally.

**Client**
Makes sense. That's not any different now. Given that these players are using AI and they can deploy much faster, it doesn't matter, even then the cycle is as long as it was earlier.

**Expert**
You're absolutely right because in evaluating all of these tools and utilizing and doing use cases, the AI for prior authorization is not proven out yet. When you're talking about prior authorization, there's really two components to it. There's the actual code information that's exchanged from the billing. You send a code to receive a prior authorization, and essentially, it's just moving from an EDI transaction to an API call. Are you familiar with those terms, to be clear?

**Client**
High level, but you can tell me.

**Expert**
Okay. That's not true innovation. It's really not enhanced by AI at all. What is on both the payer and provider side, the supplemental documentation around prior authorization, especially for complex cases and clinical identification as well is handled through this documentation, but there are companies out there, such as IBM who are offering through AI, automated on-call bidirectional documentation creation. It's very early on whether it can actually do that or not, and I've seen it in use cases, but put into practice and scalability, etc., just isn't there. That's the major constraint right now with prior authorization.

**Client**
That's helpful. Can I understand the cycle from you in detail? Let's say when a vendor starts talking to the payer, I'm sure they're obviously talking to multiple similar vendors, how does the cycle proceed from the first engagement and then over the next few months if you can explain? The context is trying to evaluate from the side of the vendor how much time they have to develop the product compared to having the first demos ready. How much is the lead time there?

**Expert**
Very good question. Like I said, the typical process starts out right now what you're seeing on most payers is they have what's called a transformation office. The transformation office receive their direction typically from a strategy council. The strategy council sets forth strategic initiatives. In the case of prior authorization, it's really pressing right now because many payers, one, are not making money and, two, there's a lot of friction between payers and providers. This is being contested heavily. There first has to be a strategic initiative that it's tied to.

The strategy department will create a strategic initiative, the strategy council will agree to the strategic initiative, then it will be handed over to the transformation office, not the IT department. The transformation office or the operations offices right now are really sitting there saying, "Okay, where are we not able to meet our strategic goal?" If it becomes a technology issue, the IT department is really brought in to evaluate the latest and greatest, look at Gartner, look at other, look at their network, bring in and develop a list of

## Discussion on Payer Processes

**Client:**
Do payers typically do pilots in this process?

**Expert:**
Not necessarily. Because payers are different than a provider, you only have one infrastructure. You only have one system. There, it becomes a choice architecture. Are you familiar with the term KAPs vendors? The BPaaS, are you familiar with that term?

**Client:**
No, I don't know.

**Expert:**
The business process as a service is end-to-end processing, but you can outsource it to the vendor themselves. In both the KAPs and the business process as a service, they're end-to-end processes. You would not just be evaluating prior authorization, you would evaluate their whole end-to-end from enrollment to eligibility, to provider or utilization management, and so on and so forth. That decision itself would be encompassing of the prior authorization. For the things that you're talking about right now would be just a payer that would say, "Hey, we want to incorporate AI functionality into our prior authorization."

In our case, we work with Availity. Because they're an existing client or an existing vendor, then we might go into an evaluation process with them up into demonstration. I do have to say, with regard to your first question around piloting, most organizations are really trying to get away from piloting. The problem with piloting is that if you just pilot and you say "Okay, it works," you can't test it at scale. More what they're trying to do is test things at scale.

**Client:**
I see. Can you give me an estimate of what percentage of payers probably do pilot programs, or is it too small?

**Expert:**
I would say that the majority, let's say half of the payers right now probably still do a traditional bring them in, evaluation, demo, those type of things, and then half do not. Half are moving towards more agile, more transformation office, etc., and avoiding pilot programs. They thoroughly test out through the design of the product that they're acquiring and they fully integrate their staffs into that process to determine that it will work according to plan. You have to remember the systems that we're talking about are considered big-bet decisions for payers right now, so they'll take a long time and due diligence around it. I'd split it 50/50.

**Client:**
I see. The main reason for the 50% that's not doing pilot programs is that it's not as helpful because they can't test it at scale, so what's the point?

**Expert:**
The organizations are going to multifactorial, multidisciplinary decision processes along with agile, and they're moving to agile processes. In an agile world in project management that you avoid piloting as part of that process, it's more iterative. They're bringing the teams in, they're testing things out at a smaller scale together, shared data arrangements, etc. They're making that determination go or no-go before they get into.

a big-bet decision like that.

Very good example with like the PII right now, as I was describing before, if the vendor comes in and says it does the functionality of handling documentation, you're probably going to set it up and just do a test around the documentation, maybe bring a provider in to that discussion as well, just to see how those particular things in that component would work and whether it's feasible and sustainable.

**Client**
Got it. My next question is around understanding are we in a war zone or are we in a very fast-paced time right now where it evolved last year in terms of scribing. The context again is if a company is trying to launch, go into the AI-driven prior auth space tech, is it a market that could be lost if they don't launch rapidly, or can they take more time and build their product further and launch six months from now? I'm trying to understand the difference between now compared to six months in terms of the market.

**Expert**
Very good question. Let's look at that through the strategic initiatives for a payer, which are very similar. There 's typically only five of them. One is around member engagement, making the members happy. Two is around financial health for the organization. Three is, you have financial health, you have growth is a big one as well. Right now with AI, there's more of a focus around member engagement and streamlining processes, making sure members understand their requirements, what they get paid for, etc.

A lot of payers really aren't jumping into the revenue cycle functions yet because, one, they have so much invested in their legacy systems. There are mandates by the government right now, the 72-hour rule to process prior authorizations from CMS, but the government right now is in flux whether they're going to follow through with any of that now because of the change administration. They're sitting on that information right now. With prior auth, it's a huge, big bet. They need to make that decision. There's a lot of money tied to it, but they have time.

Everybody has time, so they don't necessarily have to rush into that decision. They have some time to test out, look at the market, look at a lot of other ways that AI is improving the business. I do believe in the next three to five years, if you're not using AI for your billing transactions, then you could be at risk as a business.

**Client**
I see. It's not like it's going crazy like scribing was last year within the next few months, but definitely, vendors should go ahead in the next one year, two years, three years at max.

**Expert**
Yes. The other thing that there's a little bit of wait and see too, are you familiar with the electronic health record called Epic?

**Client**
Yes, of course.

**Expert**
Epic launched a thing called Payer Provider platform that is supposed to include prior authorization functionality in there. The payers are very hesitant to enact that for several reasons. Several have gone and implemented it but didn't set it up for prior authorization. They're sitting there in a wait-and-see pattern with that one as well. The other thing is Epic doesn't address the documentation management at all either.

They're looking more towards just saying to the payer, "Hey, you should approve. If we send it to you, it should be good and therefore you should approve it," which really isn't going to happen. With that said, there's a wait-and-see approach that if I develop a solution around prior authorization on my side, could it be impacted potentially by some of these other changes with other large entities such as the electronic health records providers. Does that make sense?

# Document Content

## Client
I see. Can I follow up on that? Why are payers hesitant to move to Payer Provider platform by Epic?

## Expert
First and foremost, if you look at it, and this is not all payers' stances as well, but through claims adjudication and through prior authorization, it's a form of reducing utilization by a provider partner. I'm not saying every organization has to have policies around what they're going to monitor, what they're going to audit and what they have thresholds with that including you have Milliman Care Guidelines you know there?

A payer would set the Milliman Care Guidelines to sit there and include more in each so that they could meet the requirement, whereas a provider uses Milliman Care Guidelines and they may have less requirements, it's all to their specific thresholds and tolerances for those particular things.

With certain payers, using this as a way of controlling cost, if you outsource that responsibility to a provider tool such as an EHR, how is it in the best interest for the provider or the payer. You still have the biggest problem that exist between payers and providers, which is information asymmetry. What has to evolve with this prior authorization and claims adjudication between payers and providers is almost like a data aggregator to act as an intermediary.

## Client
Coming back to the AI-driven prior authorization solutions, like you were saying, Availity or Cohere, EviCore, all of these. I'm trying to understand, at this point, what is the adoption rate among payers for such solutions?

## Expert
The adoption rate right now for modern solutions is low. You have several different players that are out there right now and more are evolving as they grow. However, what I was telling you before is what are they doing in terms of AI. Most of the ones that you gave me are like Cohere, it's really focused on using predictive analytics for care pathways, etc., like higher provider adoption rate and so on and so forth, but their weaknesses is that they're not very large and they don't scale well with a really large provider. Several of them fall into that category.

More are focusing on the AI for clinical decision support, which the doctors right now are still not bought into as evidence by other companies that are trying to do AI clinical decision support and it's not fully adopted by the physician community as accurate, etc. Where I would like to see more with these is more on the documentation management as opposed to like the clinical guidelines. I don't think clinical guidelines really slow down the process of prior authorization and claims adjudication.

## Client
I see. Essentially, it's still a long way. The penetration will be low for some time then.

## Expert
I think so. Right now, the product strategy for most of these are not what the payers are buying or searching for. It's what they're selling. Until the product strategy or the tools meet what the payers and the providers are buying, there's going to be friction there. Does that make sense? They're just automating things for the sake of automating things rather than sitting there saying what are the true pain points of the providers and the payers at this point.

As far as I know, working with clinical guidelines and clinical decision support may be for complex care cases, and really that's it, but the guidelines are the guidelines, and they have been established by Milliman for quite some time now. There may be some efficiencies by being able to integrate, but that's the other point I would like to make too is Cohere and EviCore, they come with their own evidence-based guidelines.

That makes sense from a product strategy, but it really doesn't. Almost all organizations use Milliman and most of these solutions are trying to be the record of source for information. I don't know if that's the best approach or best strategy because Milliman is pretty much the de facto standard.

# Transcript

## Client
That makes sense. Right now, you're saying everyone is roughly doing the same thing and Milliman already solved that. The penetration is not low because it's like payers have not picked up on the latest solutions. It's more because the solutions are not meeting the exact needs yet.

## Expert
Correct. If you look down through your list too, like Cohere and EviCore you had mentioned too, you have to break up the market for payers and segmentation. One is for ones that have 26 million members and up, and then I always go 26 million-10 million, 10 million-five million, and then five million and below. The Coheres and the EviCores and the Anterior are pretty much for smaller sized payers.

Availity has strong ties with Blue Cross Blue Shield. That's more or less Availity is a Blue Cross Blue Shield play, although they're trying to expand that. Change Healthcare is for larger. Change is so large that you'll find them in your largest payers because of their size and scalability.

## Client
Makes sense. When you say larger payers, could you give me examples? For Cohere Health also, you don't actually need to tell me their actual customers if that's not public, but like what kind?

## Expert
Like Change, again, this is on my part, you'll find them in the UnitedHealthcares, you'll find them in the Aetnas, you'll find them in the Cignas.

## Client
I think for Change, I understand, but for the Cohere, Anterior, EviCore or Availity, you said the Blue Cross ones are there. What about Cohere, Anterior and EviCore? When you say smaller payers, what do you mean?

## Expert                                 Sean Doolan
I would say they probably would cater more to the market of individual Blue Cross Blue Shield plans like Arkansas, like South Carolina. I'm just guessing here, but they would probably be smaller plays for smaller payers, small- to mid-size payers. I would like to highlight the problem isn't just payers picking the solution as well is, one, the choice also has to be whether providers will benefit from their choice of prior authorization as well because they have the interoperability on their side. Some of the smaller players that stands out too like EviCore, again, one of the weaknesses that's documented is it's complex to integrate with smaller health systems.

## Client
That makes sense. That is why their payers go to them. Okay, those are all my questions. Thank you for your time and your insight, I appreciate it. Have a great day.
