# Tandem DD Log

## Daria - DD Call

### Background

*   Originally from Germany
*   Masters at MIT in Data Science
*   Was at Oscar where she met Sahir, was on Data team for 2 years
*   Spent early day on modeling prescription side of things, identifying FWA, and digital experience side
*   Went to company called Rhino, joined as first data hire. Had the opportunity to build data function there
*   Wanted to also go into different business functions, and data minded generalist with a data foundation. Just seemed a great fit from an SME fit

### Why did you join Tandem?

*   The team - Sahir is an incredibly sharp and talented person
*   The pool of folks he was bringing on board
*   General setup was good
*   Personally, was also really excited about business model. Great that you build around access not in profit
*   Finally, just an interest in taking hairy boring problems and solve them in a really smart ways

### What are your core responsibilities today?

*   Role of the generalist, think about early partnerships part of her day on the data side specifically
*   First one is tablestakes analytics, tracking the right things, organizing in the right way
*   There are opportunities for a quick model to give a quick sense of what's happening in the business - can end up with her. Will help us do it
*   On the AI side, been really exciting part, working with engineering - how do we structure various problems that we're solving with AI, how do we measure success

### Review of the team?

*   Good overall
*   Been exciting to see the group of people grow both generalist, and patient cases on the ground
*   Even as we've grown over the past couple of months on the ground
*   Maintain cohesion, not just social, but also problem solving

### Sahir's management style?

*   Really great balance of someone who leads (doesn't create a vacuum of indecision), as well as inviting opinions
*   Super sharp, can be in all the details

### What are your biggest concerns / what keeps you up at night?

*   How much there is to build
*   Trying to build for an ecosystem of all prescriptions

## Michael (Modern Migraine) DD Call

### Background / scope of practice

*   General manager for Modern Migraine, specializing in headaches
*   Do have a flagship HQ in Manhattan
*   But between our providers (head physicians and PA), are licensed in 15 states
*   Can see folks virtually as well
*   By far the biggest hurdle that he sees in the healthcare world
*   Biggest headache is insurance and specifically prior auth
*   We are a in-network provider

### How did they come across Tandem

*   Cold outreach from them
*   Tried various other solutions with various lever of success
*   Reserved it originally to longer term patients
*   Next, we did just prior auth ones
*   Helps us to be able to send everything at once

### How much do they spend on admin staff today helping with medication access?

*   Harsh reality is that we don't do it, so we have to pick and choose what we can do
*   We would have to hire an FTE to staff this prior auth

### What is their experience with Tandem, what has your ROI been?

*   Been great. Measuring from an ROI standpoint has been tricky

### Review of the team?

*   Good for lack of a better word
*   We have 3rd party firms always reaching out, and he was one of the few that actually delivered value and seemed intelligible about the space

### What are premium services you would think about purchasing?

*   Would be willing to pay them a shit ton of money for the service they're currently offering
*   By far the most useful thing he's had from a partnership perspective, given the ease of use, flexibility, and time savings

## Arpa Garay DD Call

### Background

*   Was at Monitor for 5 years
*   Went to BMS, then recruited to merck and spent 16 years there across oncology pharmacy P&L corporate strategy
*   Also led digital and data science groups
*   Then went to Moderna, it was only 2022, got to build from scratch
*   Stayed there for 2 years, transitioning out now beginning to think about next role

### Initial thoughts

*   You would almost have to start with specialists
*   Changing a workflow is next to impossible so the non-dispensing pharmacy
*   Usually a provider has a preferred retailer today for a script as a PCP
*   Specialists make a ton of sense

### Broadly, what portion of pharma commercial budget is allocated towards Medication Access?

*   10-20% of spend, bigger and bigger focus due to deductibles and evolution of PBM plan design
*   Pharma would absolutely be interested in this, they don't spend the majority of the dollars today around HCP/PCP engagement and rebates
*   However trend is still beneficial
*   Would dig into whether or not there is a regulatory concern
*   Question is also can we get all players in a category

### How does the commercial side of the house think about spend on solutions? Are they generally more willing to provide larger deals if they clearly see ROI than the R&D side of the house?

*   R&D wouldn't even touch this type of size
*   If they see a proven ROI if they do it
*   The easiest way in is to start with a pilot, let's look at the region over the first 6 months, they will go all in
*   Commercial team just has the massive budget, would go straight to the marketing leaders

### Given hubs are supposed to provide PA services today, why do brands typically pay for both CoverMyMeds and ePA?

*   Usually did hub stuff for oncology
*   Sometimes you pay for both, you don't mind paying for both given the ticket prices
*   Could also pay for data & analytics fee but has to be tightly used

### How does pharma actually measure ROI within medication access / ePA?

*   (No content provided for this point)

### If Tandem has such a compelling free product, what would compel pharma to pay for them?

*   (No content provided for this point)

## 04.04.2024 Follow-up Questions

### Can you help clarify the unit economics?

*   The model indicates $2 of unit costs per script (vs. $15 today). However, the unit cost is calculated off of a provider's total scripts - are you assuming 100% script capture?
    *   In a standard case, the only required manual intervention is reviewing the auto-generated PA and (if necessary) denial triage/appeal letter – these are our human-in-the-loop processes, and we have informed conviction around how these will come down over time and can eventually be cut out. However, our costs are currently inflated beyond those components by a few categories of operational work:
    *   Atypical PA processes that need to go through specific small-scale portals or are non-electronic/fax – we are working on pulling these into the same workflow that most of our PAs go through today.
    *   Support for patients with major affordability issues, where we need to work through a set of options with them – we are well in the process of automating and product-izing most all of this, and we also consider this to be work where are going above-and-beyond our minimum service level, i.e., this will become a paid/premium service.
    *   Phone calls to insurance plans and pharmacies to ensure everything is moving through the pipes as expected – this is almost entirely offshore, and, similar to above, we consider it to be above-and-beyond our minimum service level. Part of why we are investing in this now is so we can fully understand the universe of possibilities and both diagnose and anticipate issues automatically in the future. We also believe that AI phone calls are a near-term certainty.

### What wallet share of total scripts (and prior auth scripts) do you have today with scaled practices?

*   The blended assumption is that we get 100% of PA prescriptions and then some portion of other prescriptions (approximating if we were to get the full batch of prescriptions whenever an appointment/batch results in at least 1 PA prescription). This is not 100% script capture.
    *   Close to 100 using it monthly
    *   They might use it only for their complicated drugs, all biologics, all cGRPs, branded drugs
    *   Could be anything that has any prior auth and complexity
    *   Could be for convenience anytime if they have at least one script that has any complexity
    *   Or any script possible
    *   Only group that is not at least Level 2 is one of the PE groups
    *   80% are at least Level 2 today
    *   We pull the zip code, scrape GoodRx and SingleCare, we'll find one or two cash pharmacies, and one national mail cash pharmacy
    *   Do have a tiny office in Idaho, just a placeholder to have a full license
*   This is generally reflective of our fully deployed practice behavior – our current focus is on capturing 100% of PA prescriptions, taking other prescriptions primarily for provider/patient experience reasons. Over time, we can invest more in capturing 100% of prescriptions to support broader opportunities.
    *   For specialty, needs to have large TAM on the pharma side, high pain on the physician/patient side, and relatively concentrated
    *   We eliminated upfront complexity and controlled substance
    *   BlinxRx, CareMetx, CoverMyMeds, and Phil have one
    *   We are moving off of non-dispensing pharmacy to EHR integration
    *   Blink will only help for the ones where they have a contract
    *   Could also integrate with athena and ModMed in the app store

### Provider Traction

*   Where are you in the rollout of the 3 PE roll-up practices you are currently “Expanding” with? What are the stage-gates to a full national expansion?
    *   #2 (the first one we signed) is 10% launched but fully greenlit for and pushing through nationwide rollout, which we expect to complete in Q2. #1 is also nearing 10% launched but has been focused solely on biologics, so we expect much more volume - it was gated by a preferred EHR integration approach, which was just launched this week. We are now coordinating on staging the rest of rollout. #3 is early – we are in our first couple clinics but starting to ramp up. In general, we have been slow-rolling expansion while we focused on product development.
        *   #2 is our earliest practice, they've already laid people off and not backfilling people. Probably rolled out by
        *   Have a schedule
        *   Individual physicians are asking to be escalated above the waitlist
        *   Second group, crossed over the EMR line, and talking over the COO
        *   They also offered to invest in the company
*   Of the two multi-practice (80 and 40 docs) groups that are in Contracting phase, when would these go-live and what are the key sticking points for them?
    *   #11 (80 providers) should be live in April – they are a clinical center-of-excellence and asked to add some language around anonymization of data used for other purposes. #12 (40 providers) is on an archaic EHR system, so we are working through access approach with their IT team – they may take until later this quarter to go live. I'll note that we just moved #17 (25 providers) to contracting and expect to start rollout next week. We expect multiple others from the PE Rollup set to move into contracting in the next few weeks.
        *   Just slow because of Change
*   Where exactly do you expect to be by the end of 2024 from a # of providers standpoint given you have ~1,000 live or close to go-live today?
    *   Our conservative expectation is to be at 1000-1200 providers fully deployed by EOY, assuming that large groups roll out at a constant rate as opposed to an increasing rate. However, we may be able to move more aggressively.

### Pharma Traction

*   Where exactly are you in conversations with pharma / when could a deal realistically materialize?
    *   We expect to land multiple small-mid pharma contracts over the next couple quarters (we are at contracting with one and proposal with another already) and 1-2 big pharma contracts by EOY. I wouldn't consider what we have a pipeline, as sales hasn't been a focus till now, but (through friendly customer development) we're actively engaged with the relevant commercial teams at and see paths to pilot with AbbVie, Sanofi, UCB, and BMS for top drugs across our target TAs.
        *   Sanofi we have the most executive level engagement (CCO), path to piloting Dupixent
        *   Abbvie is an interesting place. Got wind that both of them are talking to you, now a question of who is paying for this
        *   UCB we have a close relationship asked for a couple of super subscribers
        *   BMS - all of these larger provider groups have corporate account managers, that woman heard of us from #2 group, pulled into conversations
*   Who would be your first partner?
    *   Mayne Pharma is the smaller pharma that we expect to be live first this year. Among big pharma, it could be any of AbbVie, Sanofi, or UCB, but we also have warm relationships at Pfizer and Lilly that we plan to pull soon that could accelerate quickly, based on our footprint and impact. Now that provider growth feels steady and repeatable, pharma pipeline will be a core area of focus for me. We just brought on a hire this week from McKinsey's Life Sciences practice who was fully focused on pharma commercialization, including patient services, to support this effort.
        *   Trying to convert pricing into contractual structure. Essentially converting 30 cents on the dollar. They are injuring to provider groups
*   How consistent are the prescription patterns and mix of scripts across your partner practices?
    *   Neurology is pretty consistent, as the specialty is organically separated by condition focus. Dermatology is a little more varied, particularly because we are more indexed to large groups, where providers within may have different foci – we see more of a "super prescriber" phenomenon, where any individual drug tends to be concentrated to a subset of providers in the practice (though those subsets don't always overlap).

This is part of why we're excited about the fact that Dermatology supports monetization both through blockbuster drugs (i.e., biologics) and concentrated topical products (e.g., like products from Mayne Pharma, Galderma, etc).

## 04.02.2024 Diligence Session

### GTM and Monetisation

*   What is your take-rate today? How does that compare to the $80 per prescription in Migraine and $200 per prescription in Immunology that you outlined?
    *   Patient access is the #1 pharma commercialization problem. 5% of revenue goes to Hub Services & Patient Assistance, $32B spent on access support in total
    *   Pharma hub services persist similar fragmentation
    *   LLMs enable automation for 10X+ better cost structure while improving performance

*   We've been able to demonstrate insurance coverage lift, time to access reduction, and EV lift per branded Rx of $1K+
*   If we guarantee 10x ROI for pharma, that is $40-100K revenue opp for Tandem, / physicians
*   3-5x ROI is more than sufficient to price

### How exactly do you contract with pharma today? Who are your initial partners? Are these contracts portfolio/TA wide or are they drug by drug?

*   No regulatory issues, CoverMyMeds is similar has non-dispensing pharmacy so it is okay to be paid by pharma
*   We're spending time with a lot of the pharma companies, lots of small-to-mid cap contracts
*   Big pharma will take until next year

### In the future, can you talk about how you could monetize with other stakeholders in the value chain?

*   Retail pharmacies - pay for routing Rx volume (like GoodRx). 15% take rate generates $9B TAM
*   Specialty pharmacies - pay for admin savings and routing volume - $10B TAM for just admin on $100 per Rx fee
*   PBM / Plans: pay for admin savings and routing Rx volume - $30B TAM with $5/PA fee + 5% take rate

## Financial Performance

### Where do you plan to get to from a scale standpoint by the end of this year (vs. 2025)? From an ARR, # of practices, # of scripts standpoint?

*   Want to get to 3,500 providers, ~1M scripts, ~$10M+ in run-rate revenue at 1 contract
*   In 2024 for end of this year is 1000 physicians on board, 100-150K scripts, will be in the 3-5% market share range for those
*   Today we have 1,000 providers signed, $5M run-rate. Today we are not generating revenue on those
*   Have another 1,100 in the pipeline

### What is your gross margin today and at scale - how do you build to it?

*   Our gross margin is ~85%. 64% for first contract
*   Today our cost per prescription is $15, could bring that down to $2

### Burn

*   10 folks on the team, 5 engineers/data scientists where most of the spend goes
*   1 generalist biz ops person, 2 junior ops people

## Product

*   Can we see a demo?
*   What are you using LLMs for and what data sets are you applying your AI to?
*   How much of the workflow is still manual for your team or has a human in the loop?
*   Can you share data on improvements in fill rates or prescriber hours saved or other ROI generators from existing practices?
*   What are your major product & engineering priorities for 2024 and 2025?
    *   Today what is automated is getting insurance, identifying right place to go, abstracting into to EMR, and generating form, identifying evidence to attach

## Team

*   Human in the loop shows to review output on the model, prior auth, give feedback, and then submit
*   If it gets denied, it is potentially appealed
*   We also have humans making phone calls to confirm benefits or check-in on prior auth
*   We're assuming there are certain types of medications in migraines where our time to review is <1 minute, where it is 4-5 minutes in other areas vs. benchmark of 30-60 minutes, offshore/automate calls, working through differentiating level of services

### How many people today?

*   (No content provided for this point)

### How do you plan to expand the team?

*   (No content provided for this point)

## Fundraising Process

### How much did you raise in your seed and what was the pricing / investor ownership?

*   Did a little over $7M last year, Thrive did a majority
*   Was a SAFE with a $35M cap
*   Still have $5.5M in the bank

### How much do you have left and what is the amount you're looking to raise?

*   Expecting to raise $20-30M
*   We'd expect roughly $15M towards OpEx, move engineering team from 5 -> 25
*   Need to invest in commercial bench to pull contracting forward
*   Budgeting remainder that even in a bad case scenario that we can support human-in-the-loop

### What is the process timing?

*   When we last spoke, we had a few things we wanted to understand well before we went to the next phase. Big things were that we could a) build the form factor to make it trivial for any provider to adopt, b) when we put this in the hand of physicians that it resonated, c) see that we would have a meaningful impact on patient access, and d) conversations with pharma has differentiation vs. the existing market
*   We've seen a lot of inbound organic demand that has given us conviction to grow beyond the goals that we outlined
*   Wants to make sure everyone who he's excited about can dig in
*   Someone put in verbal terms over the weekend

### Is there a data-room we can review?

*   (No content provided for this point)

### Can we meet other key members of the team?

*   (No content provided for this point)

### Could we chat with any of your current customers (both provider and pharma)?
