## Expert
Yeah. We looked into a number of different products. We actually test drove probably five different products in our organization. I personally was only able to test drive two of them and those are Abridge and Ambience. I just want to make sure we're commenting on the right ones here, put the disclaimers out there, which ones I can appropriately comment on.

We were able to test drive those in our space. I'm specifically working our emergency departments and so that was more my specific role. That's why some of the products like Suki and DAX Copilot, they really just didn't offer anything in our space. Abridge and Ambience did so that's where we went. I could dive into those more specifics or whatever direction you want me to go.

## Client
Sure. I guess what prompted you to start looking into any of them? Was it from clinicians saying, "We have heard about these tools, we want to start using them," or is it more from a top-down approach?

## Expert
Yeah. It seems like everybody is jumping on this. It's almost like one of those things, you have to do it or you're behind. Every conference I would go to, if people were talking, there's whispers of who's starting to do this and who's not. To be quite honest with you, we actually started to have people get quite a few positions and we'd get some of our contract positions for actually expressing interest in developing their own products.

It seemed like these things were almost like a whack-a-mole type thing. We're just popping up left and right. We even had, like I said, docs saying, "Hey, let's market this one, let's market that one." We had to get out of it. We had to pick something and go with it. It almost seemed like a land grab-type thing. Like whoever's going to be the first one to grab something to go with it is going to be the winner so that profited.

I think one of the biggest dissatisfiers, at least in America, is charting and the number of times people are in the EMR. That's constantly what we hear is a major dissatisfier of working on the job and staying after your shift, finishing charge and things like that. If there's something out there that can improve that, I think that could be the golden ticket as far as improving your employee satisfaction.

## Client
Got you. At the Clinic level, were you trialing the product across ED, inpatient, outpatient? Were you trialing it across a few different areas, o did you start really with the ED use case?

## Expert
No. I think the initial pilot was ambulatory only, which is like outpatient, and then the EDs and other subspecialties. That picked up after the development. A lot of these vendors don't have specialty-specific products yet. For us, when we were talking, we're like, "Hey, let's find a good partner that's willing to develop things with us and develop something specific to our needs in each of these specialties." That was equally as important, to find a vendor willing to work with you and develop for those specialties outside of just an ambulatory realm. When I say ambulatory, I mean outpatient family practice, preventative medicine, that kind of stuff.

## Client
Got you. Like outpatient clinic kind of type stuff?

## Expert
Yep.

## Client
Cool. Was that one of the key criteria then when you assessed if they would help work with you and help develop solutions?

## Expert
Exactly. It was going to be a good partner.

## Client
Did you measure engagement at all through the process? How did your staff rank against each other?

## Expert
A pre-utilization survey and then a post-utilization survey is one of the metrics obviously. That's just subjective happiness, which tends to do well. There's a number of metrics you can obviously measure your productivity, your patients per hour, your RVUs per hour. RVUs are something that measures your productivity in terms of financial impact.

You could measure that, we don't. To be quite honest with you, we don't know yet. We're still trying to figure out exactly the best way. I could tell you subjectively, a pre-utilization survey and a post-utilization survey has been the most effective. I don't know if you've used this type of software, but it is transformative. It's been overwhelmingly positive. Just want to spread the good news on it.

## Client
Awesome. It sounds like you chose Ambience against Abridge. Where did Ambience pull ahead and how would you compare them against each other?

## Expert
I want to be clear, I was not part of those negotiations or anything like that. I was part of discussing those things, but I don't know as far as the contracts and that. I could tell you what we made our recommendations on. Ambience seemed willing to work with us outside of just an ambulatory space. Ambience tended to be willing to adapt and make something for the ED that wasn't just a one-time touchpoint.

Meaning like I sit down, I have an interview and then it generates a plan. Ambience seemed to understand that in other spaces you might see the patient two or three times and talk to them ad hoc and then update them on the results. Ambience seemed to understand that and be willing to work with us and build a product for that. Abridge to me felt like it was very preventative care-oriented.

Meaning it would generate notes like you'd say, "I noticed you mentioned they have hypertension," or something like that, and they would generate a plan for hypertension. I don't give squat about hypertension. I do, but not when you're here with your broken ankle. That tended to be a recurring theme with them. I'm sure their software editors could iterate upon that, but that tended to be something that we noticed with Abridge.

## Client
Got you. How long was the implementation process and what was the timeline? It sounds like you started with ambulatory and then moved to ED afterwards.

## Expert
Yeah, it's still going on. It's still in implementation. It must be honest. It's been a matter of months, which is in terms of IT initiatives is quite we call it Operation Warp Speed. It's incredible how fast it's gone. That's a testament to their developers. Ambience, that is. A matter of months to get thousands of physicians up and running, which is just incredible.

## Client
Got you. What percentage of your organization now would you say is using it? What do you think the end state could possibly be? Do you think everyone would be able to use this?

## Expert
Yeah. There's still lots of kinks to work out and stuff like that. Our inpatient teams aren't using it yet because

they're developing something which the way we share our notes and use as a cosigner, I don't think that's what they've got yet. They've got a fix for that. We don't have inpatient up. I'd still say it's less than 50%, but I'd say the sites that have it available, this is purely a ballpark and I have seen these numbers at one point, but I forget the sites that they have it and they can use it and if they want to use it, it's ready to go. I think it's like 60%. What's that?

## Client
Sorry, was that 50%?

## Expert
Yeah. I think it's slightly over that even. I think it's like 60%. The anecdotal number though.

## Client
Got you. How did you find the position take up? Was everyone pretty happy to start using it? What was the general attitude towards trialing it?

## Expert
It's funny, initially people hear AI and there's a little bit of a grumble in that. I tell you what we've noticed is that people go and in ambulatory centers using it and you go and you take your kid for an earache and they come out and say, "My doctor's used this." They see it. A lot of our doctors seeing it firsthand then they're like, "Oh my gosh, this is amazing. My child's pediatrician just got this." I feel like that and these testimonials that they see on our homepages like, "This is transformative." That has been the real selling point. You don't have to really advertise it once you get a couple of docs to use it, it's self itself, that type of thing, which is really incredible.

## Client
Yeah, Would you say that's like any scribe in general, or would you say that's specific to Ambience?

## Expert
That may be anyone in general. Just being honest there. I talk to other docs at conferences, the sentiment is similar. Why? "Why aren't you get us doing this?" It's amazing.

## Client
Abridge has been chosen as Epic's recommended solution. You're hearing more about Abridge when it comes to comprehensive stuff. Is there more of a push to trial and use them?

## Expert
Yeah. Epic has these select partners, these tiered partners. I think that's the selling point. Is that Abridge? When you sit down with them, they have this what looks like this ironclad platform where it's right in their phone software, which is called Haiku, and it's built in and it's seamless.

I think that the natural inclination is, "Oh I want that," because it seems like everything's worked out. It's ready to go. It's off the shelf as turnkey. I'm not sure that that's entirely accurate. I think if you get some developers who have decent talent with Epic, it's not that hard to seamlessly integrate. It's a series of smart phrases that automatically refresh into the note.

I think I had that same sentiment up front looking at Abridge and be like, "Wow, they've got the videos and it's right there on Epic and look at this stuff." As you look in the other products, it doesn't seem to be that unique. Maybe in the future Epic through some sort of antitrusting phases of the other vendors out. Right now, I don't think that that is as big of a deal as Abridge makes it to be.

## Client
Got you. How important is the integration to the EHR? There are some new, free play, like Freed and Heidi that are coming in this space. Would you say it's that integration piece is super important or not so much?

## Expert
Yeah. I think it is of paramount importance. I have used these products in a pilot format where they are not integrated. When they are integrated, it is just night and day. It's cute and it's fun when it's not integrated. The reality is if you want to use it on a mass level, you need to be integrated. Your users who don't understand smart phrases and copying and pasting, they're not even going to think about using this. There's the content, which should be one and then 1A or 1B should be integration. I'm not sure it's as big of a deal or it's as difficult as Abridge will tell you what it is.

## Client
Got you. It would not be too hard for them to build that in, but it is super important for you guys when assessing?

## Expert
Yes.

## Client
What was the engagement like with Ambience throughout the trial? Did they lean in and help train some of the physicians, like training programs or what was that like?

## Expert
Again, I don't know what our contract looks like as far as their training, but they have been awesome. They've led physician training sessions, they've led troubleshooting sessions. They've been incredibly responsive. I continue to be impressed by them.

## Client
Cool. What aspect of medical coding and the billing sort of stuff do you need to do in your day-to-day ?

## Expert
That's a great question. Every ED over in America is a little different as far as how they do billing and coding. Some of them do their own coding, some of them export what our EHR generates out into almost an antiquated PDF and then send it to a billing and coding company. Others use the EHR itself to generate coding. If you want my honest opinion, I think these types of softwares are going to explode that market. That's going to be turned on its head.

I don't think in five years we'll be building encoding the way we are with some of these companies. The reality is these products like Abridge, Ambience, I know Ambience is working in this space, I'm sure. This should enable billing and coding right from their product. I think there's even suggestions that we move to that in some of our ambulatory query spaces.

This generates a, "Here's a little PDF to the code" or "Here's what we should be coding." This could do automatic coding right there. I think the summary to your question is nothing right now, but we know that this will fundamentally change that and could make it a whole heck of a lot cheaper. It could put some folks out of business.

## Client
Yeah, your clinic is quite large. Do you employ your own coding staff or do you outsource that aspect of it at the moment?

## Expert
Yeah. We're all over the place. Some departments, some specialties outsource it. Some of them do their own EHR-generated stuff. We outsource ours right now, but I can tell you this is going to change that. I think this will change. This is going to explode that world. It's like this new frontier that everything is all of a sudden

changing because it's all being generated by AI. It's like everything in AI.

## Client
Definitely. I might jump around a little bit going back to the pilot. If you have to stack rank Abridge and Ambience, give them both a rank out of 10, where would you sit them both and why?

## Expert
Just overall?

## Client
Yeah. Just overall.

## Expert
Ambience I would give a nine. Abridge I would give a seven. How about that?

## Client
Got you. You're using Ambience now in your day-to-day all the time. How has the engagement changed since finishing the pilot? Do you find people using it more, people using it less? Has anything changed?

## Expert
Since starting a pilot am I using it more?

## Client
Yeah.

## Expert
I think the answer is yes. Yes, yes, using it more. New applications, new little. I think once you realize how much you can interact with it, you find yourself using it more. Stupid things like a conversation with a specialist or something like that. You can have it listening, you can dictate in when you've done a chart review. Those are things that we would often find yourself running back to the computer and packing away to record that conversation. You can have it listen into things like that.

## Client
Got you. Do you use the dictation software? It just came to mind. Do you use Dragon or any of those sorts of things?

## Expert
Yeah, Dragon.

## Client
You still keep Dragon?

## Expert
Yeah, like everything in healthcare, remains as legacy. I think the big picture with this could ultimately replace Dragon. I don't know those contracts and things like that. I'm not privy to. We've got people who still prefer Dragon for just the dictation mode. I want this to go exactly as I say. Again, we're still very early in piloting and all that stuff. Right now we still do have Dragon. In my opinion that could go away eventually.

## Client
Got you. Sorry, just jumping back again, you mentioned that the implementation with Ambience has been like operation warp speed, especially when it comes to IT rollouts. How difficult would it be to swap to a different ambient scribe now that you're with Ambience? I imagine going to conferences you might hear that

competitors are doing something new, would it be to swap?

## Expert
I don't. It's probably unfair for me to say that because I'm not doing the nuts and bolts of it, but given how quickly it was implemented, I wouldn't think it to be as groundbreaking as one would think. It's not the same as switching from EHR from Epic to Cerner or something like that. There's right now we're not at the point where we have a ton of customization right on a user level.

I don't think it would be earth shattering. I think it'd be difficult, but I don't think it would be as difficult as changing. I'm sure you're in healthcare IT but some of the stuff changing it would be like moving mountains. At this point you pick, you got to dig in. I don't know just because of the lack of customization at a user level and the way that they build these things, you're taking their off-the-shelf product.

Early on, I don't think it would be. Now as you know with most healthcare IT products, when you have your product and then you customize it over the years to continue to make it work for you guys then I think it would be. I think that switching gears or switching tracks at six months probably wouldn't be, if you ask me the same question a year or two from now, probably more difficult. I don't know what that's going to look like.

## Client
Got you. When you say a customization at a user level, is that for example you would have your own templates of notes or style of speaking ways of working and at the moment there's not much customization at the individual level?

## Expert
Correct. That's by our choice. You give them the links and stuff like that. If you set them up and build them with a note template and say, "Here's a note template to use," then everybody's using the same thing.

## Client
Got you. If they were to turn on the coding and billing solution tomorrow, what would be the process of implementing that for you? What would need to change and all that kind of stuff?

## Expert
Yeah. That would be probably a more administrative. We're just such a large organization that the folks who do our revenue cycle management are not the same leaders that do this sort of implementation. It should be a different department for us, technically speaking. They're like ready to go on this stuff. They could do it. I don't know that they actually have people that manage the billing itself, but I've seen the extracts that they generate. We have certain items you have to discuss in our medical decision making every time to reach certain levels of coding.

I'm sure you guys have something similar, but it can just generate a report based on the inputs you've described and that that can be extracted instantaneously from the chart as it's generated. I've seen it. There's a little PDF that you can have it generate and then you can send that to the billing coding company or you could the billing coding in-house with that PDF. It's pretty straightforward and pretty impressive. In terms of turning that on at a large organization like ours, it's not quite that easy, but for a smaller group that could be relatively quick to implement.

## Client
Great. Thank you.

## Expert
Answers your question at all.

Yeah. It would require someone Ambience to say, "This is ready help please introduce me to your RCM people," and then the RCM people to pilot it, I would guess. Is there anyone you think Ambience isn't good for?

## Expert
I've not seen it yet. Like I said, I think to start off for my specialty, I didn't think it was good. I was like, "Yeah, it's not really fit our needs," but quickly adapted to what we need. I've been impressed. Like I said, I think that there was some concerns over shared notes that they've already fixed. No, I honestly don't. I don't know if you guys use this type of software.

Just one thing I think that they particularly excel in is when you talk with a patient about, "Hey, here's some things I want you to look for when you go home. Here's some signs to come back for," it generates this really fantastic after-visit summary of, "Here's your letter to the patient on an eighth grade learning level with simple terms to hand to the patient so they can know what exactly you said. I think that little piece right there has been transformed. I didn't see that with Abridge. I know that they made it, but it didn't ever come to fruition like I saw it like I wanted it to. With Ambience it did. I think that could be used in every single space.

## Client
Thank you so much. I think that was probably the end of my questions. That has been really helpful. Thank you so much for your time.

## Expert
I think you guys will get so excited to hear other docs talk about it. It's not a panacea by any means, but it's really been nice to be able to sit and look at a patient in the eye and talk to them instead of pecking away at your computer or freaking out about trying to remember when they started taking their Eliquis at 6:30 A.M. and then they stopped it once and then the symptoms came and you have to worry about that stuff. You could just focus on the patients, which I think is transformative.

## Client
That's awesome.

## Expert
Yeah. It's been night and day, like the stupid little even little things that we little workflows where you're like, "Oh, we can put this out in triage, where people are just rattling things off a mile a minute because they just got there and they want to tell you, and it's tough to get all that stuff down." Sometimes they mumble. You don't even hear what medication they say, and it picks it up. It picks it up and you're like, "That's fantastic."

## Client
Thank you for taking the time to speak with me. Have a nice day.
