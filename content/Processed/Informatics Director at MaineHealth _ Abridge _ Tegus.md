# Client-Expert Conversation Transcript

## Client
Thank you so much for taking the time to chat with me today. I'm excited to learn more about your experience and some of your insights. To start, could you give me an overview of your background and experience?

## Expert
Yeah. I was saying my title, informatics director, part of the IT leadership. I manage a team of 25 physician informaticists and some IT team members. As informaticists, because we have clinical background, but we also have experiences implementing clinical solutions and now expanded out to beyond clinical so IT and business applications and solutions, our job is to basically guide and advise the organization when they're evaluating, selecting, designing, implementing, and also monitoring the use of these clinical and IT solutions.

Relating to this topic, it sounds like we're talking about ambient dictation, specifically focused on Abridge. My team in informatics and the clinical specialty leaders got together and built a business case and strategy around bringing ambient AI into our health system to better improve the efficiency in the workflow for our clinicians, specifically mostly providers. Those are physicians and we call them APPs, so advanced practicing practitioners. That's our physician assistants and nurse practitioners as well.

Another thing about me I could add is I also co-chair the artificial intelligence advisory committee. We started this a couple years ago, and the goal is to bring in more AI to our organization in order to automate and improve efficiency for what our care team do. That's just my role.

## Client
Got it. In terms of the size of the health system, can you tell me a little bit more? Thank you.

## Expert
Due to our current administration in the U.S., they're reducing the Medicare reimbursement for patients. It's now going to be reduced even more. Part of relating to a lot of these strategies that we do in IT is trying to automate and make things more efficient for our team because revenue is going down.

Also, part of our healthcare system, we have 12 hospitals, 745 clinics. We have about 2,000 providers. People like to compare beds. We have about 1,400 beds, 22,000 employees. We've been on Epic, which is our EMR since 2008. In our EMR, I think our patient volume is about 2.3 million patients.

## Client
Got it. Can you tell me a little bit more the reasons why you decided to adopt scribing tools? Was it because the providers were pushing for it? Was it because you were trying to increase collections? What were the key reasons?

## Expert
The biggest thing really is that our provider burnout survey constantly has been not that great. We're trying to find better solution. Also burnout, it's really into documentation. Providers, or particularly physicians as well, they go into medicine because they want to care for patients, they want to spend time with patients. As you probably have seen in the healthcare field, since the electronic medical record has came into play, this digital medical record, their role is to document. If you see a patient, you need to document the encounter.

The issue is now they're spending less time with the patient while they're in the office. Patients complain about that, providers have complained about that. Just over time, there's just a lot of requirement for clinical documentation, which then is leading to burnout. A lot of providers also reporting that they're having to basically do clinical charting outside of their clinic hours.

Although you have to keep in mind some providers actually prefer to do that. Like myself, I rather leave at 3:00 P.M. when I'm done with work and then finish up at 6:00 P.M. Some providers like to do that, but generally most providers would like to finish what they have to do in the office and then leave and go back to their family.

## Transcript

**Expert:** Really, a lot of the driver was burnout and shortage of staff. Like what we were alluding to now is like, financially we struggle, but also is that before COVID we struggle with having enough people in the role to do things. If we're talking about specifically in a clinical setting, it's still the same thing. Now there's less people. I don't know where people going, they're starting their business or what. We do struggle to keep enough people.

In neurology, we need like five more additional neurologists, but we're struggling to recruit them. It's not just my healthcare system, all across our colleagues are saying the same thing. We need more cardiologists, but we can't get three additional one that we need. Those are some of the drivers which then led to us really just trying to reduce burnout, reduce the documentation time. To do that, you want to improve their workflow and the patient experience.

**Client:** Got it. Trying to either increase revenue or decrease burden for the RCM process, was that a driver as well or less so?

**Expert:** Yes. We have some data we can share too. Perfect timing, we just ran data in June. Based on reduce your documentation time and how efficient they are, there's estimation that I can share. There's estimation of how many more patients you can now see. If you see the patients, you can bill them.

**Client:** Very helpful. Can you tell me more about the process you ran, which providers of technology you evaluated, and why you decided to pick the one you picked?

**Expert:** Yeah. Ours was quite a journey. Ambient dictation, it felt like it was new in 2021 as vendors were ramping up. When we did our RFP, we did the evaluation by October 2021. We looked at Nuance, Abridge, Ambience Healthcare, Suki, Nabla. I feel like I'm missing another one, but those are the essential ones.

**Client:** All those companies already existed in 2021?

**Expert:** Some of them, yeah. This is why I lead you to my next statement was they weren't as mature. The Suki, the Nabla, they were there. Actually, I will include even Ambience Healthcare. Back then in 2021 we did the evaluation, they weren't as attractive. They had experience with smaller healthcare system, where we feel like we are larger and we need to be able to ramp up and scale up. At that time, we also had embark on, there's a buzzword, digital transformation initiative called application rationalization, meaning we're trying to simplify our application landscape and vendor. We tried to pick a vendor that we already had in the organization.

Microsoft owns Nuance. Nuance at that time had a solution called DAX. DAX actually had someone in the back end transcribing for you. It records and then someone is actually checking, then they move towards having DAX Copilot, which is all AI now. That's the future now, the AI is doing it.

We actually did the evaluation. We piloted Nuance because we had Nuance in our system for also Dragon, which is the dictation system. We knew Abridge at that time actually was pretty good too, almost like apple to apple. We highlighted Nuance just to also feel out ambient dictation. You have to remember it's new to our providers. Having a phone put between them recording their conversation, it's a bit scary for clinicians.

We want to see what the adoption would be like. We pilot Nuance with the vendor that we already knew and we had. Go back to our evaluation, we took out Suki, we took out Nabla, took out Ambience Health. Knowing that Abridge might be an option as well and maybe Ambience Healthcare, but we're like, Nuance, the responses sounds good. We asked them to come in to have a demo, with Nuance, Abridge, and Ambience.

# Healthcare Technology Implementation Overview

## Introduction
In June 2022, we selected Nuance for a pilot program. The feedback was overwhelmingly positive, with many users expressing their appreciation for ambient dictation. While there were some reservations from a few individuals regarding the new technology, the majority embraced it. By 2023, we progressed to phase two with Nuance, incorporating DAX Copilot, solidifying our commitment to ambient dictation and AI scribing.

## Cost Considerations
The primary concern now is the cost associated with Nuance, which is substantial, amounting to millions. With approximately 2,000 providers, we aim to expand our offerings to include ambulatory and inpatient services across all specialties. Our strategy involves evaluating whether Nuance remains the right solution, especially considering the importance of AI in our operations. We are not inclined to opt for a cheaper alternative that compromises functionality.

## Vendor Evaluation
We conducted a thorough evaluation of Abridge, Nuance, and Ambience Healthcare. Abridge stood out due to its ongoing product development and robust integration with Epic, our EMR system. Epic is known for its agnostic approach to vendor recommendations, but Abridge's inclusion on Epic's peer list, which signifies a strong relationship and compliance with certain criteria, was particularly appealing to us.

## Pilot Programs
We decided to pilot Abridge concurrently with Nuance. The feedback from users of Abridge was similarly positive, with many expressing satisfaction comparable to that of Nuance. Transitioning some users from Nuance to Abridge yielded favorable responses, highlighting that both solutions were comparable in quality.

## Decision to Transition
Ultimately, the decision to transition from Nuance to Abridge was driven by cost considerations and the deep integration with Epic. We initiated the pilot in August 2024 and finalized a contract with Abridge in November 2024.

## Implementation Process
### Initial Pilot
- **Pilot Group**: 20 licenses were tested initially, while still maintaining licenses with Nuance.
- **Cost**: The pilot cost was in the low five figures.

### Expansion
- **Contract Signing**: Upon signing the contract, we gradually offered 500 licenses to providers.
- **Additional Users**: We included residents and fellows, totaling 344 additional licenses, bringing the total to approximately 840 licenses.
- **Current Usage**: As of now, 412 licenses are actively in use across 44 specialties.

# Document Content

## Client
Is it all outpatient or also inpatient?

## Expert
It's inpatient as well. That's the other thing to add. We liked about Abridge is that the templates and it looks like the way they have built out the features for inpatient is more robust than Nuance. No, we do offer it to the inpatient as well. Keep in mind we're doing slowly rollout on some templates too. The ED, for example, it was recent where we rolled out some of the templates.

Maybe to answer your question, even back up, it really started with ambulatory, because when we did the pilot with Nuance and Abridge, it was just ambulatory, and we knew that setting so we could do an apple-to-apple comparison. Once we started the contract, we started rolling out because you have to imagine we're not new to Abridge. We pilot August, but we're fully blown now out really in this year.

Things are being developed, templates and stuff, rolling them out slowly. ED has come out, and we tested it, and that looks really good now. We're doing that. I would say ambulatory then moved into inpatient but slowly rolling out more templates for inpatient.

## Client
Got it. Did you roll it out in all locations at the same time or some locations first?

## Expert
We opened it up to entire 12 hospitals, 745 clinics.

## Client
Got it. Do you just use the scribing product? They have, I think, two new product features now. One around coding suggestions and one around nursing. Have you tried any of those products?

### Sean Doolan

## Expert
We are in the process of getting quotes and stuff, and chatting with them about the nurse one. We're not live, but that's on our roadmap. The coding is there. It's not really you have to turn on. It's actually part of their scribing. This is interesting because Ambience Healthcare is actually a great company who's really hit the ground running when they started to realize what people needed.

When we did all of this, Ambience Healthcare wasn't very mature in the coding suggestion. I haven't seen a demo, but hearing from colleagues, for example, this year Ambience Healthcare just recently won a contract, a huge contract with Cleveland Clinic, I think, in Ohio, which is a big healthcare system, bigger than even my healthcare system.

Actually it's interesting, when people are looking for AI scribe, it's usually driven by the clinical side, like us, because we want to improve the workflow for our providers, we want to reduce their cognitive overload, we want to reduce their burnout, it's driven by clinical side. We're seeing a shift now where the coding, the revenue cycle people, are seeing the value in this.

Cleveland Clinic is driven by the coding side, the revenue cycle people. I think there'll be a shift where there's going to be a partnership, where it's driven by both because if you can reduce your own revenue cycle team time and the clinician time because of suggested code, that is also a win-win. I've seen that shift. When we started, it wasn't about the coding, it was more like get the documentation in there so that the providers can move on. Now it's about the coding as well, which I'm really excited about.

## Client
That makes total sense to me. Tell me more about how it's gone for the last six months, both qualitatively and then quantitatively, if you had to rate it from 1-10, one being the lowest and 10 the highest.

# Expert Insights on AI Scribing Solutions

## Expert Commentary
I went to a conference at Epic in the spring, and I have been hearing colleagues talk about Ambience Healthcare. The coding is really exciting. It seems much more mature than Abridge, but I've seen Abridge continue to mature it. I still give them 10/10. I would 10/10 recommend it to colleagues.

If they had Nuance and they can get a great price, go for Nuance or Ambience Healthcare. It really comes down to cost because they are very similar. The way they built out the backend formulas and modules for the AI, it seems like they're doing similar things. It really comes down to cost.

I would recommend Abridge to people. We have providers who say they can't imagine going back to not having AI scribe. It's like if you keep using Microsoft Copilot or ChatGPT, you start to realize, if you're using it right, it can really improve your efficiency. You get used to that.

I have project teams who use Microsoft Copilot, and they're like, "I can't imagine this." I tried to relate that to my providers who are using Abridge. They also can't imagine going back. Also, you get young residents and fellows who come in. They love this kind of stuff. They're baffled if an organization doesn't even offer something like this. That's 10/10 I would recommend and also like. Would it be helpful to share some of the metrics we've been gathering? Would that be helpful?

## Client Response
That would be great.

## Data Presentation
Yeah. June 24 was the last time we ran the data. We went into Epic. We worked with Abridge. It's like a partnership to combine the data together to pull some meaningful presentation which we gave to our senior leadership, such as our chief financial officer and our president of the medical group and the CEO of the organization. Here's some of the data that we got.

I'm trying to see what data would be helpful for you. I'll try to run through them quickly, and then hopefully you're recording and you have some numbers that you can play with. I don't have the baseline number, but we have about **73,000 total notes generated**. That's since we've gone live with them. We signed in **November 2024**. In about **February**, we moved everybody from Nuance onto Abridge. February feels like the true go-live. Everyone's on there now. Everyone's using, and that's a lot actually from February to now, it's five months. This is across the specialties that are live on these, that have templates that they can use. About **73,000** to me is great. When we're looking at projection, actually it went really quickly. It's like a big steep jump. We even look at minutes recorded, like **1.4 million minutes recorded**.

This one's interesting, I tried to look at this. About **200 were generated**, **100+ clinical notes**. Actually one of my providers is so excited about this, he has over **1,000 Abridge notes**. That's how crazy it is. It's not like he's seeing more patients, he's using it all the time. This is great. That's what we want.

We do have criteria. You have to be able to ramp up a certain number of utilization percentage. If you don't, then we're going to take the license away, and we're going to offer it to someone else. We have **37 who generated about 500+ clinical notes**. **97%** is average user retention. Meaning there's a few who drop out, and that's fine. It's not a requirement at this point to say, part of employment at MaineHealth, as a provider you have to use Abridge. It's just a tool for them. Just like Nuance has Dragon dictation, it's a tool for you. We recommend that they use it. We try to increase adoption through colleagues sharing with colleagues.

Ours right now is **97%**. I anticipate those other providers may turn around as they see this is now the norm in the culture and start to see how others are using it. The thing you have to keep in mind is providers don't have time to sit and watch another provider do something. Often, especially the one who is just clinic, my physician informaticists, our team, we have admin time. We have time where we can go and walk the floor and check out other people and see what they're doing.

Most providers are getting in and then getting out, and want to ask the patients. We're hoping that number will go to **100%**, but we shall see. About **85%** is the average percent of effort reduction based on people, the data, and reporting.

## Specialty-wise Insights

Specialty-wise, this might be interesting. By the way, I take a lot of these calls about this. You guys are in the right space right now because everybody wants to be talking about this. Yes, there are a lot of specialties that's on this. The easy one to start out is usually family medicine, family practice. It's just easy. Templates are pretty straightforward. With them, it's ambulatory. We went live with that group first and then went to internal medicine, pediatrics, part of the primary care. That went live.

As you go live, you're going to release certain templates that they have. For example, pediatric well visit. When your kid goes through the office and they see the provider, that's a template that they use. They're not building out something on their own. Epic has it. Abridge is building these out and standardizing them across the system for all of us. We went live with that, the pediatrics one, in May of this year.

The other specialty that started to really roll in, that started using this one, was orthosurgery, psych, cardiology. Like I said, ED just recently went on, neurology just recently went on as well. OB-GYN, gastro, and then definitely inpatient. Inpatient is slow, just because we've been so focused on ambulatory with all the pilot. We're definitely going to be ramping up, I think, same speed just as we did with ambulatory.

Just so you know, get a sense on the specialty. I would add though, probably it will be based on also champions. In my organization, we have physician informaticists, 25 of us, and that's 25 specialties that they cover. I have a gentleman in behavioral health. The psych one, they ramped up really quickly because the physician informaticist on my team, he loves ambient dictation, he loves Abridge. He actually used Nuance and then moved to Abridge. He loves both of it, that he's just talking about it everywhere he went within his specialty. That's why psych ramped up so quickly because of the champion within that service line.

## Client Inquiry

**Client:** Did you collect data on revenue expansion?

**Expert:** Data round of ROI?

**Client:** Sean Doolan
**DO NOT COPY**
sd@virtuevc.com
Yeah, either for expanded coding or increased number of visits, anything.

**Expert:** Definitely. Good point for sure. We have a category that we call it financial outcomes. These are early estimates of ROI. Keep that in mind because we're still fairly new. Making an assumption, assuming we maintain 2% increase in our appointments and 1.6 million office visits, those are assumptions in what I'm going to share with you. In the past one year, if all these ambulatory providers had Abridge, this could translate, we're estimating, to an additional 33,185 visits. That's early, but even if that number was even cut in half, that's a lot.

**Client:** Okay. Do you know percentage-wise or dollar-wise what that would represent?

**Expert:** We haven't done the number because we're a little bit concerned about sharing too much of the dollars number at this point. I would have to talk to our finance to see what number they would assign with visits. I wonder, you can just do a Google or something, like an average, if you just take an average $300 per visit times that.

**Client:** Got it. As we think about all the uses of AI you can have in your system beyond scribing, we talked about RCM. Is that the next logical one? Where are you also exploring using AI?

**Client**
No, in general, to be for clinical copilot or nursing line automation. You tell me.

**Expert**
Okay. Not just ambient dictation, where else would we focus on this?

**Client**
Exactly.

**Expert**
This is interesting. I don't have all of it, but within our AI advising spree, if just categories wide, it would be our RCM, continuing to improve the clinical documentation. If I had to choose the other one which we've been focusing a lot more on is just within IT.

IT specifically too, there's just not enough people to do the work, and we know that they're being recruited by for-profit organizations who can pay more. If they pay double what we pay, but it's healthcare system, we're nonprofit, we can offer so much whatever the market says that we should be paying. We can't go from saying the market says you should pay them $90,000 a year, and we can't go and say now we're going to pay you $150,000 a year. It's not realistic for us with also our finance going down.

Those are the top three. I feel like I'm just saying almost all the departments within the organization, but really it's the RCM, the clinical, and the IT side. IT is a lot of how we do the work, like offering them Microsoft Copilot, which actually we've been piloting and now we're actually going to go live with them. Within IT, it's also even managed detection and response for cybersecurity. How do we use AI, or actually you might have to go to a managed service provider who uses AI to do that, which is what we do.

We recently just went and signed. We are now working with a company called ReliaQuest. Everything they use is AI to try to detect any weird abnormal activities within our organization across all the devices and stuff that are being used within our organization.

Those are our big ones. I'd put the revenue cycles on top. It's just because if we can figure out a more efficient way to do things to capture more back is going to help with the financing. It's just going to balance or maybe even make it better for our financial health because the financial health is going down. How do we increase the RCM activities to increase the financial health there, and then hopefully it balances out?

**Client**
Are you using a specific tool like a SmarterDx or a Nym or another tool for RCM today?

**Expert**
Epic has a lot of AI tools that are being rolled out and turned on within organizations. Actually, recently, two Fridays ago in our AI advisory group, we had Epic come and basically tell us about all these AI that you can use in the ambulatory side, the revenue cycle side, or they call it finance side, so the inpatient, ambulatory, and then you can have the finance side.

They have these AI things that you can turn on that can reduce claim denials or improve the coding accuracy or faster cash flow, those kind of things. There's some AI stuff, and again, this is not my area of expertise. We have a finance guy and RCM who sits on our AI advisory group. There are AI within Epic, and that's where we're going to first. We do use someone to help us reduce our claim denials. I assume they're using some AI stuff in their work to make it efficient for their team. There's actually a team of people who do the work.

We do use a company that helps with claim denials. We used to use Change Healthcare, their product's called EPREMIS, to help us prevent denials and speed up the claim process because we also don't have enough people in our revenue cycle team to do the work. We recently transitioned to Experian ClaimSource. The goal is really to get rid of some of these vendors and move towards Epic. Epic hasn't built everything out.

yet, but once everything is live, we would like to move back to just using Epic for this.

Yes, the answer to your question is a lot of it is focused on using what is in Epic because you have to keep in mind our team, even under revenue cycle people, they're living in Epic because that's where the patient documentation is happening, because you're coding for what was done to the patient, you're billing for what's done for the patient. Everyone's living in Epic. Our goal is to keep things in Epic as much as we can. Overarching wise, we're really looking for improving the coding and charge capture, the claims management, the denial management.

Prior authorization is definitely a workflow thing that we're trying to figure out. Epic is trying to build out some AI stuff to help with that, because there's a lot of staff, particularly in the ambulatory side, who helps to help with getting the paper, making sure all the data's in there to get the prior authorization ready for the provider and then in order to send it to the payer and help for the patient get their medication or their surgery.

Lots of stuff for AI. The other thing I would add is, it's not a priority, but it's existing, is AI in the research space. Actually, in our organization, our research folks are really interested in that. They're continuing to try to do more in that space. I don't know of other healthcare systems are the same as us.
