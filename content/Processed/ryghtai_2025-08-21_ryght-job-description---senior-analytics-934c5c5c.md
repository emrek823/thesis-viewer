# Clinical Data Analytics Leader

## Location: Remote (U.S.), Ideally EST
## Type: Full-time

## About You
You're a strategic partner to leadership who thrives at the intersection of data architecture and product development in the healthcare and/or lifesciences industry. You excel at transforming complex data into reliable, scalable solutions that directly power user-facing features and drive business impact.

You approach problems from first principles, identifying appropriate data sources and potential partnerships to solve real business problems, while designing clean data models and integration patterns that serve both analytical needs and product functionality. You're passionate about using data to solve meaningful problems and believe that clear communication and genuine collaboration are as critical as technical excellence.

## What You'll Do

### Define Data Strategy & Architecture
*   Partner with leadership to co-define our data roadmap, establishing prioritization frameworks for clinical data sources including trial protocols, patient enrollment data, regulatory submissions, and site performance metrics
*   Design scalable data models and transformation pipelines that convert complex clinical data into clean, reliable assets powering both analytics and product features
*   Implement robust semantic layers and data lineage documentation that standardize key clinical metrics and enable reliable data consumption across the organization

### Build Product-Integrated Data Solutions
*   Collaborate closely with Product and Engineering teams to ensure clinical data seamlessly integrates into AI-driven matching algorithms and user-facing applications
*   Design integration strategies that balance real-time data requirements with system reliability, determining when to use live APIs vs. pre-indexed approaches for optimal performance
*   Architect robust API integrations with clinical data providers, MPCs, and private data sources while maintaining data quality, privacy compliance (HIPAA), and regulatory requirements

### Champion Data Excellence & Cross-Functional Collaboration
*   Establish and champion data modeling standards and best practices across the organization
*   Lead cross-functional initiatives to ensure data quality, consistency, and accessibility
*   Mentor team members on analytics best practices and data integration strategies
*   Facilitate discussions between technical and non-technical stakeholders, translating complex data concepts into clear business narratives

### Drive Business Impact
*   Turn stakeholder needs into prioritized data initiatives and technical requirements
*   Define metrics and evaluation criteria for data quality, pipeline performance, and business impact
*   Maintain and communicate progress on data initiatives, balancing strategic infrastructure investments with immediate business value

## What You Have

### Required Qualifications
*   5+ years of experience in Analytics Engineering, Data Engineering, or Data Science roles within a life sciences-related organization
*   Experience with clinical data sources, healthcare metrics, or regulated environments with privacy compliance requirements (HIPAA, GxP)
*   Proven track record architecting data solutions that integrate with product applications and user-facing systems
*   Strong experience in cross-functional collaboration, with ability to translate technical concepts for diverse audiences
*   Exceptional communication skills and ability to build trusted partnerships across Product, Engineering, and business stakeholders
*   Expertise in SQL, Python/Java, and modern data stack tools (dbt, version control, CI/CD)
*   Bias for action—you prefer launching iterative solutions that deliver immediate value over waiting for perfect implementations

### Nice-to-Haves
*   Experience integrating data systems with AI/ML workflows, vector databases, or LLM-powered applications
*   Working knowledge of containerization (Docker/K8s) and cloud deployments (AWS/GCP/Azure)
*   Experience with data warehouse optimization and query performance tuning
*   Familiarity with API development and clinical data provider integrations

## Why You'll Love It
You'll be at the forefront of transforming how clinical trials are conducted worldwide, directly contributing to bringing life-saving therapies to patients faster. Your data architecture and insights will power Ryght's AI platform that creates “AI Site Twins” of every clinical trial site globally, helping pharmaceutical companies identify the best research sites and streamline trial processes that traditionally take months into workflows that happen in days. This isn't just about building great data infrastructure—it's about being part of a mission where friction can disappear, drugs can be approved faster, and lives can be saved. Working with prestigious biotechs, pharma, CROs like QPS and Biorasi and academic medical centers like USC Keck School of Medicine and Emory University, you'll see your work scale across a network that's revolutionizing a $140 billion industry.

As a fast-growing seed stage startup, you'll have unparalleled opportunities for professional growth and impact. You'll help define our data practices from the ground up, working closely with leadership to shape both technical strategy and company direction. With our rapid expansion and ambitious vision, there's significant potential for career advancement as we scale our team and platform.
