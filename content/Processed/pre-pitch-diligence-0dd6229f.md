Pre-Pitch Diligence

Context: Virtue has a pitch deck and is preparing to take a call with a startup for a potential investment. We want to understand what the company does and compare it to previous materials we have in the same space to derive unique insights to be prepared for that call. The best founders pick their investors!

Why are we breaking down the workflow? If we select the entire knowledge base + Villagers Health deck as sources, it only pulls from Villagers.health deck. Let’s break it down in discrete steps below to tease out details and better understand workflow

Questions / Workflow:

3 main pieces https://app.lynq.ai/chat/share/clvcwglv80001f17leetzlues

What does this specific company do? Great answer

Process: Upload pitch deck and select single source

Prompt: Provide a detailed description of what this company does and how it makes money. Write at least 4 paragraphs. Provide information on the specific market they are tackling, how their solution is differentiated, what the product is, and what their business model is. Provide 5 simple keywords that allow Lynq to conduct a broad search to find more sources

What other sources do we have that we can compare this company to? Tough to compile multiple sources, but when you do - great answer

Process: De-select specific pitch deck and search all sources.

Prompt: Find all sources related to these keywords (copy and pasted from above response). DO NOT INCLUDE PREVIOUS SOURCE(S).

Based on the pitch deck (1) and these additional sources (2), what (if anything) is differentiated with this model? What key questions should we be asking during the call?

Process: Ask 1 prompt for information from new sources, then ask to combine in subsequent prompt

Prompt

List 5 specific lessons can a future technology startup learn from these sources. Provide quantitative data to support your reasoning.

Take the "Lessons for Future Technology Startups in Healthcare" and apply that to your response to Villagers.health.
