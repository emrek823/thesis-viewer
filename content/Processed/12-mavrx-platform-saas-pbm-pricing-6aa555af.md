## Slide 6: Why PBMs Win with Our PMPM Guarantee

**MavRx**
by WriteWise

# Why PBMs Win with Our PMPM Guarantee

### The Challenge
Most PMPM guarantees in the market are synthetic - built on old claims data, inflated with exclusions, and lacking actuarial credibility.

### The WriteWise Solution
WriteWise enables PBMs to issue real, risk-backed PMPM guarantees:
*   Built on predictive analytics (trend, churn, manual rates, volatility)
*   Modeled at the NDC level, not channel averages
*   Receives underwriting credit of 15% on average on Medical Stop Loss policies
*   Delivered in minutes, not weeks

**Outcome:** Data-backed, future-looking pricing you can confidently stand behind.

| :------------------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Predictive PMPM-G Modeling**        | Compete on future cost, not just historical reprices                        |
| **Actuarial/Machine Learning Precision** | Replace spreadsheets with validated, underwritten guarantees                |
| **Speed to Market**                   | Generate bids instantly - not in weeks                                      |
| **RFP Advantage**                     | Win consultant-led deals with transparent, future-focused pricing           |
| **Stop-Loss Integration**             | Reduce client premiums by aligning pharmacy pricing with underwriting integrity |
