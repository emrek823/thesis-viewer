The world doesn't change because incumbents decide it should. It changes because someone, somewhere, decides the system is broken and has the conviction to build something better.

From AI to global commerce, from infrastructure to wealth management, from money movement to
identity, from data to energy, the greatest breakthroughs come from those willing to challenge
what's safe, familiar, and comfortable.

At Ribbit, we partner with these rebels. But we don't just back them, their technology or their
business models. We back their ability to build brands that matter. The founders who see the cracks
before anyone else and know that fixing them isn't enough. You have to make people believe in the
fix.

We bring conviction, capital, and a global network. But most importantly, we bring an obsession with
brand. Because the companies that reshape industries don't just solve problems. They change how
people think and feel about entire categories.

We've partnered with entrepreneurs on nearly every continent who understand this truth: when you
combine vision with relentless execution and the ability to build brands people love, industries
don't just transform. They surrender. The status quo may be powerful, but it's rarely prepared for
the right kind of rebels.

The next era won't be led by the largest or the loudest. It will be led by the boldest. Those who
know that changing the world means changing minds first. If you're building to challenge the status
quo and make people believe, you're already speaking our language.
