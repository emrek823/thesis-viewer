# Pharma Transaction Marketplaces & Prudentia's $1B EV Path

## Executive Summary

The biopharma industry is at an inflection point where traditional models of drug development and commercialization are under pressure. The era of ultra-lucrative “blockbuster” drugs is waning – only ~45 products topped $3B in annual sales in 2022, versus 188 products that would have cleared the old $1B "blockbuster" bar 1. R&D costs have soared (averaging ~$2.3B per new drug 2 ) even as big pharma faces a $200+ billion patent cliff in 2025-2030 3. In this environment, companies can no longer bet on a few mega-drugs; instead, they must build portfolios of more targeted $1-3B peak sales assets while ruthlessly pruning or monetizing the rest. This has given rise to the **"zombie asset" problem** – many promising drug programs languish undeveloped on corporate shelves due to strategic misfit or capital constraints, tying up an estimated $30B in investor capital across nearly 300 small biotechs 4. There is a clear need for better liquidity and standardization in how pharma assets are traded, licensed, or sold, so that capital and molecules can be recycled to their best uses.

**Prudentia Sciences is poised to address this need by evolving from an AI-driven diligence platform into a transaction marketplace for pharma assets.** By building the “rails" for buyers and sellers of drug programs to connect and transact, Prudentia can unlock value similarly to how other industries have benefited from new marketplaces. Comparable platforms – from Carta's private equity market and Axial's M&A network to MarketAxess in bond trading and Zillow/Opendoor in real estate – have shown that standardizing data and increasing transparency can massively boost market efficiency and liquidity. In biopharma, a neutral marketplace could transform today's opaque, relationship-driven dealmaking into a more efficient, data-rich exchange. Sellers (pharma/biotech companies) would capture more value through broader bidding and faster deal cycles, while buyers (big pharma, investors) gain streamlined access to vetted opportunities (albeit with reduced "alpha" from under-the-radar steals). Crucially, more assets changing hands means fewer viable drugs get shelved, improving overall R&D productivity and patient outcomes.

This report analyzes the market dynamics and strategic considerations for Prudentia's marketplace vision across eight sections: (1) Why the timing is right given current pharma trends; (2) Lessons from analogous marketplaces in other industries; (3) How a marketplace model differs from Royalty Pharma's principal-investor approach; (4) The trade-off between transparency and investor alpha; (5) A case study of Novartis's portfolio strategy as a harbinger of marketplace demand; (6) New financial products enabled by liquidity; (7) Positive impacts on biopharma R&D efficiency; and (8) a roadmap to achieve ~$120-180M revenue and a **>$1B enterprise value** for Prudentia. We conclude that a Prudentia marketplace can ride powerful tailwinds - patent cliffs, the push for R&D ROI, and capital market innovation - to become a category-defining platform in pharma, with a durable competitive moat built on data standardization, workflow integration, and a liquidity network effect.

## Market Context: Why Now?

Several converging trends make this the right moment to introduce a pharma asset marketplace. First, the **blockbuster drug era is fading**, forcing a strategic shift in pharma business models. The threshold for a "blockbuster" has effectively risen to ~$3B in annual sales, and only a few dozen drugs reach that mark now 1. Meanwhile, payers are less willing to reward incremental therapies with premium prices 5. This means big pharmas can't rely on one or two hits to carry their portfolios; they are increasingly targeting **many mid-sized assets** (each perhaps $1-3B peak sales) rather than searching for the next $10B/year mega-drug. Indeed, companies are beginning to bake commercial potential into early R&D decisions - asking at Phase I/II, "Can this drug realistically hit $2B+ in peak sales?" 6. If not, it may not justify full internal development. This harsher triage creates a larger pool of "orphaned" assets that could be valuable to someone, if there were an efficient way to trade them.

Second, **R&D productivity challenges and the "zombie asset" phenomenon are mounting.** Pharma R&D success rates remain low and development timelines long, which makes capital allocation critical. When a program falls out of favor internally - perhaps due to strategy focus or a pipeline reprioritization – it often becomes a zombie: not officially dead, but not advancing. Industry observers have identified billions in such trapped value. For example, a 2025 analysis found over **$30B in capital stuck in ~300 struggling biotechs** whose stock prices collapsed despite having cash and assets on the books 4. Activist investors and funds (e.g. Alis Biosciences) are now emerging with the goal of liberating this "trapped" cash and IP, either by liquidating companies or selling their drug assets to better owners 7 8. As one fund founder put it, solving this issue is vital "if capital is to be effectively recycled... to finance exciting new science" 9. In short, the industry needs a mechanism to re-deploy capital and projects from where they aren't productive to where they can thrive.

Third, **big pharma is under pressure to optimize at the portfolio level and recycle capital.** The looming patent cliff from 2025-2030 will wipe out an estimated $230B in revenue as blockbuster patents expire 10 11. To fill those holes, large companies must simultaneously accelerate external BD (business development) and trim internal fat. We see signs of this in actions like Novartis's recent pipeline "clean-up" – discontinuing or out-licensing ~20% of their R&D projects after a strategic review of commercial potential 12. Those cut were primarily early-stage programs outside core therapeutic areas or unlikely to meet high revenue thresholds. This kind of **pruning** (Novartis expects $1B+ in cost savings from narrowing its focus 13) frees resources to double down on winners and seek acquisitions to bolster priority areas. The net effect industry-wide is an increase in asset turnover: more assets will be looking for a new home, and more companies will be active buyers to feed their pipelines. However, today's process for matching these buyers and sellers is inefficient - it relies on who knows whom, ad-hoc outreach, investment bankers, and lengthy bespoke due diligence, all of which limit the volume and speed of transactions.

Finally, there is a growing recognition that **liquidity and standardization could significantly improve pharma dealmaking.** Other financial markets have shown that when you introduce a centralized platform with transparent data and standardized processes, transaction costs plummet and volumes explode. By contrast, pharma asset deals today resemble the pre-electronic era of stock or bond trading: highly opaque, negotiated bilaterally, with no “price history" or common documentation, and thus very illiquid. As an example, private stock markets faced similar issues - no centralized exchange meant no price transparency, inefficient price discovery, and slow, manual trades 14. This is directly analogous to how pharma assets trade today (or don't trade). The solution in other markets was to create an **infrastructure layer** that standardizes the product (e.g. a common share or bond contract, or a data-rich listing of an

2

asset's attributes) and provides a marketplace for matching demand and supply. The timing is ripe for pharma to adopt such an infrastructure: data on clinical programs and commercial benchmarks is more available than ever, AI tools (like Prudentia's) can help evaluate assets objectively, and the urgency to unlock value from "stranded" assets is at an all-time high. In summary, the industry needs a more liquid, transparent market for drug assets now, to enable portfolio optimization and capital recycling on a grand scale.

## Other Industry Comparables (Lessons from Carta, Axial, MarketAxess, etc.)

Pharma is not the first industry to confront illiquidity and opacity in an important asset class. A rich set of **comparables exists** across finance, real estate, IP, and supply-chain markets - where new marketplaces unlocked value. We examine a few analogies and what lessons each offers for a biopharma asset exchange:

*   **Carta (Private Equity → Secondary Liquidity):** Private companies have historically been illiquid; employees and early investors had to wait for an IPO or buyout to cash out. Carta stepped in with a platform to manage cap tables and facilitate **secondary stock transactions for private firms.** By introducing tender offers and auction frameworks, Carta created liquidity where none existed, enabling shareholders to sell stakes pre-IPO 15 14. The key lesson is the power of **standardized processes and data in a previously fragmented market.** Carta's system provided structure (e.g. centralized cap table records, vetted buyer pools) and thus instilled trust to transact. It proved that even highly restricted assets (private shares) will trade in volume if you reduce friction. Biopharma can mirror this by standardizing how drug asset information is packaged (trial data, IP, CMC, etc.) and creating a trusted environment for running deal processes (e.g. controlled auctions or tender-like offers for licenses).

*   **Axial (SMB M&A Marketplace):** Axial built an online network connecting small and mid-sized businesses seeking acquirers or growth capital with potential buyers/investors. Essentially, it's a matchmaking service for **sub-$100M M&A deals** that would otherwise be brokered quietly or not at all. Axial's platform shows how **expanding the buyer universe can yield better outcomes.** A seller (say a biotech startup with a Phase II asset) might traditionally only know a handful of potential partners, but a marketplace could expose it to dozens of interested parties globally, including less obvious buyers. Axial also emphasizes confidentiality and curation – important in pharma where assets are sensitive. The takeaway is that a well-run marketplace doesn't just create a free-for-all; it can **curate matches** using algorithms and domain expertise (for Prudentia, perhaps matching assets to companies whose portfolios or strategies make them the right fit).

*   **MarketAxess (Bond Market Transparency):** Corporate bond trading was long dominated by big banks dealing OTC (by phone or Bloomberg chats), with wide bid-ask spreads and limited transparency. MarketAxess introduced an electronic platform for bond trading that greatly **increased price transparency and competition, compressing spreads and improving liquidity.** For example, without a centralized market, corporate bond traders faced information asymmetry and high transaction costs; today MarketAxess handles record volumes (Q2 2025 revenue reached $219M, +11% YoY 16 ) as more trading moved online. The big insight is **standardization of the trade unit** - MarketAxess turned bonds into something that could be quoted and transacted in a common format (with standardized data like TRACE pricing). In pharma, every asset and deal is unique, but a marketplace can impose standards on how deals are structured (common milestone

3

templates, royalty rates ranges, etc.) and how data is disclosed, enabling more of an apples-to-apples comparison. Transparency does not eliminate profits; it shifts them to those who provide liquidity at scale. MarketAxess itself became highly valuable by taking a small cut of vastly more transactions. Prudentia's opportunity is similar: enable many more deals by making the process easier and more transparent, and monetize the flow.

*   **Zillow / Opendoor (Real Estate Data & Liquidity):** Residential real estate was another opaque market - data was fragmented in MLS systems, and selling a house was slow and convoluted. Zillow changed the game by aggregating data on virtually every home and introducing **Zestimates (automated valuations)**, bringing transparency to pricing. Opendoor then went further to offer **instant home buying (iBuyer)**, providing liquidity by acting as a market maker. Together they standardize how properties are presented (home details, inspection reports, etc.) and introduced a **liquidity wedge** - Opendoor would buy a home immediately (at a slight discount) so the seller didn't have to wait months, then resell it. The parallel in pharma would be standardized “asset listings" (a comprehensive profile of a drug candidate) possibly combined with a mechanism for quick options or bridge financing to give sellers some immediate liquidity. One could imagine Prudentia or partners creating an SPV to option an asset (analogous to Opendoor buying a house) and then auction it off to end buyers. The Zillow lesson is that **rich, centralized data and unbiased valuation models drive market activity** – Prudentia's AI-driven valuations (its original product) play the role of the Zestimate, giving buyers and sellers a starting point on price.

*   **The Trade Desk (Ad Inventory Marketplace):** The digital advertising world was transformed by programmatic exchanges epitomized by The Trade Desk. Ad space (impressions) became a standardized, auctioned commodity, with real-time bidding connecting millions of publishers and advertisers. The Trade Desk created a **neutral platform** (demand-side platform) that doesn't own media but enables transparent bidding on ad units with unified data. This highlights the value of being an **"infrastructure-first" marketplace.** Prudentia likewise can focus on being the neutral rails and data layer for drug deals, rather than a principal. The Trade Desk's success also underscores how standardization (e.g. defining ad units, audience data) and auctions at scale can unlock a huge long-tail of transactions. Biopharma assets are fewer in number than ad impressions, but the idea of auctioning standardized “units” of R&D or commercial rights to the highest bidder in a transparent way is analogous.

*   **Royalty Exchange / ANote (IP Royalties):** These platforms created marketplaces for **intellectual property royalties** (music royalties on Royalty Exchange, music and media on ANote). By turning future royalty streams into auctionable assets, they provided liquidity to creators and alternative assets to investors. For instance, Royalty Exchange hosts online auctions connecting over 22,500 investors with music and other IP owners looking to sell royalty rights 17. Notably, they expanded into patent and trademark royalties as well 18 - a close cousin of drug royalty streams. The success here teaches the importance of **broadening the investor base** for assets that were once niche. In pharma, a marketplace could bring in new buyers like family offices, royalty funds, or PE firms to bid on drug royalties or equity in a drug project, beyond the usual pharma companies. Additionally, these platforms show that even fairly esoteric assets can be made comprehensible and tradable if you **standardize the contract and disclose the cash flow histories.** Prudentia can take inspiration in how Royalty Exchange presents a music catalog with its historical earnings, so an investor can bid confidently; similarly, a drug asset could be presented with its trial data, IP status, and forecasted cash flows.

4

*   **C2FO / Taulia (Supply Chain Finance Auctions):** C2FO and Taulia created marketplaces where suppliers can get paid early on their invoices by effectively **bidding a discount rate** that cash investors (or the corporate buyer itself) accept. This turned the previously bilateral, bank-facilitated process of invoice factoring into a dynamic online auction, unlocking billions in liquidity for small businesses. The core idea is **auctioning short-term cash needs to a broad pool of funders**, which maximizes value (lowest discount rate wins) for the one seeking liquidity. In the drug context, one can analogize this to a biotech seeking fast cash for a program - instead of a take-it-or-leave-it offer from one partner, they could list the program on a platform where multiple parties bid (some might want an outright acquisition, others a license or partnership with different terms). The outcome is likely better pricing for the seller and a more efficient cost of capital for the buyer. C2FO's success also underlines how **speed and efficiency** (automated platform, minimal friction) can vastly increase throughput; a pharma marketplace must dramatically cut the time it takes to move an asset (today often 6-12+ months of negotiations) by providing ready data packages and standardized term sheets.

*   **ICE - Carbon & Energy Contracts:** Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) and others took commodities or contracts that were once bespoke (like regional carbon credit programs, various energy contracts) and **standardized them for exchange trading.** By defining uniform carbon credit units and setting up futures markets, ICE brought a whole new level of scale - now companies and investors can trade and hedge emissions exposure globally. The lesson for Prudentia is the power of liquidity through **standard contracts.** Could drug assets have elements that can be commoditized? For example, a "phase 2-ready oncology asset with mechanism X" might, at scale, be grouped or indexed. While each drug is unique, a marketplace might eventually allow things like **basket deals** (e.g. a portfolio of multiple early oncology assets sold as a bundle to spread risk) or at least allow ETFs/indices (discussed later). The carbon market example also shows that **regulatory and ecosystem support** matters – in pharma, adoption of a marketplace may require buy-in from legal, regulatory (antitrust concerns, etc.), and cultural change in BD departments to shift from relationship-only deals to platform deals.

Across all these comparables, common themes emerge: standardization of the asset/contract, increased transparency of information and pricing, and broadening of the participant pool. These lead to reduced transaction costs and higher throughput. However, another lesson is that many successful marketplaces started with a specific **wedge or beachhead use-case:** Carta with cap tables, MarketAxess with investment-grade bond RFQs, Zillow with home price lookup, etc. Prudentia's wedge appears to be its **AI-driven diligence platform (Prudentia Pulse)** that can engage pharma companies on asset evaluation, building trust and data in the process 19. From that initial value proposition, it can expand into facilitating transactions for those assets. If executed well, Prudentia can translate these lessons to biopharma and become the **de facto exchange for drug programs**, something the industry currently lacks.

## Royalty Pharma vs. Marketplace Models

An important industry analog to consider is **Royalty Pharma**, which for two decades has been a dominant player in monetizing drug assets – but via a very different model. Royalty Pharma is essentially a **balance-sheet investor** (a publicly traded company, ~$20B+ market cap) that raises capital and uses it to purchase drug royalties or provide funding for development in exchange for future royalties. It has been enormously successful, leading the biopharma royalty niche with over 50% market share by some estimates, and collected $727M in royalty receipts in Q2 2025 alone 20. Royalty Pharma's model addresses one set of

5

inefficiencies: it provides a ready buyer with deep expertise and cash for institutions or companies looking to sell royalty streams. Sellers gain quick liquidity; Royalty Pharma gains a portfolio of cash-flowing assets with attractive risk-adjusted returns. However, this **principal model differs fundamentally from a neutral marketplace approach** like Prudentia's vision, and understanding the trade-offs is key.

**Royalty Pharma's Principal/Aggregator Model:** RP acts as a specialized financial player, often negotiating bilaterally with the seller of a royalty. It prides itself on **speed and certainty** – a university tech transfer office or a biotech can sell to RP and trust they will execute (they've done $20B+ in deals). Royalty Pharma uses its low cost of capital (investment-grade debt, etc.) and drug valuation expertise to generate alpha: they aim to buy royalties at a price that yields them an attractive IRR. This is possible in part because the market is opaque; RP is sometimes the only bidder or a small club of bidders for a given asset. The result can be pricing that, while fair, leaves some upside on the table for the buyer (RP). Royalty Pharma also can do "bespoke" deal structures – for example, creating **synthetic royalties** (as in a recent $1.25B deal for a Phase 3 asset 21) or providing hybrid funding (loans + royalty rights). In short, it plays an active, principal role, which requires substantial capital and confers it a degree of market power (53% share implies many sellers default to RP first). The inefficiency RP addresses is the lack of financing options for asset owners: without RP, a biotech with a royalty might struggle to find a buyer at all, or face slow, uncertain processes.

**Marketplace Model (Prudentia's Approach):** In contrast, a marketplace is about building infrastructure and connecting third parties. Prudentia doesn't intend to hold large positions in assets itself (aside from maybe facilitating SPVs), but rather to be the transaction platform analogous to an exchange. Instead of one principal buyer setting the price, the marketplace would allow **multiple potential buyers to bid on an asset**, bringing true price discovery. This addresses a different inefficiency: the lack of transparent competition. By exposing an asset to many interested parties, the seller likely achieves a higher price (more value captured for innovators), and capital finds assets more efficiently. The trade-off is that it undermines the easy alpha that a singular player like RP can get – in a competitive auction, buyers pay closer to fair value. But those buyers (which could include pharma companies, investment funds, even Royalty Pharma itself) get the benefit of access: assets they wouldn't have known about or been able to evaluate readily are now visible on the platform.

It's important to note that these models can coexist and even complement each other. Royalty Pharma could be both a competitor and a customer of Prudentia's platform. For instance, RP might use the marketplace to source deal opportunities it wouldn't have found on its own, effectively participating as one of the bidders (especially for assets that fit its mandate of approved or late-stage drugs). Alternatively, for some transactions the marketplace might reveal pricing above what RP is willing to pay, and RP steps back – those deals go to strategic buyers willing to pay a premium due to strategic fit. **Coexistence:** Royalty Pharma tends to focus on sizable, late-stage or marketed assets (where it can deploy $100M+). A neutral marketplace could facilitate many smaller or mid-size deals (e.g. early clinical assets, or $10M-50M royalty streams) that RP might ignore. By growing the overall volume of transactions, the marketplace expands the pie. **Complementarity:** Royalty Pharma could partner with or leverage the marketplace for certain functions – for example, using standardized diligence data from Prudentia to evaluate assets faster, or co-investing via SPVs arranged on the platform when a deal is too large to do solo. Royalty Pharma's CEO has indicated the biopharma royalty space is growing and evolving 22, suggesting room for new models.

From the seller's perspective, the marketplace model may be preferable for maximizing value, while the RP model is preferable for speed/certainty (a guaranteed buyer). Prudentia can strategically position itself not just as an "auction site" but as an **"infrastructure-first" provider of data and workflow** that even

6

Royalty Pharma or investment banks would use. This neutral stance - providing the picks and shovels for all participants – is a hallmark of great marketplaces (akin to how NASDAQ provides the exchange that all traders use). Prudentia's challenge will be to gain trust on high-stakes deals; early on, it might facilitate more **syndicated or co-invest deals** (blending the models) where, say, Royalty Pharma or a VC fund anchors a deal but uses the platform to fill the rest of the capital from other investors. Over time, as comfort with open bidding grows, the platform could handle end-to-end auctions even for big assets.

In summary, Royalty Pharma's success validates the huge opportunity in pharma asset monetization (it built a $20B company in two decades by addressing a sliver of the market). Prudentia's marketplace aims to **democratize and scale that opportunity**, applying a lighter-weight, tech-driven approach in place of a capital-intensive principal approach. Both models aim to unlock value from pharma IP; they attack different inefficiencies and likely will address different segments of the market. If Prudentia succeeds, it **augments rather than fully displaces** players like Royalty Pharma – much as electronic exchanges augmented dealers in bond markets – and in doing so grows the total market for pharma transactions.

## Transparency vs. Alpha: Trade-off in Dealmaking

One of the central strategic trade-offs in moving to a transparent marketplace is the shift in who captures value (and how much) in each deal. Currently, pharma asset deals are often **opaque bilateral negotiations.** Information asymmetry is high: the seller may not know how to price their asset (especially if they are a small biotech with one program), and the buyer may have unique knowledge or leverage. In such an environment, savvy buyers can secure deals at valuations that leave significant upside on the table – this is their **"alpha”**, essentially excess returns gained from an illiquid, non-transparent market. For example, a big pharma might license a promising Phase II drug from a cash-strapped biotech for a modest upfront payment because the biotech had few alternatives. If that drug later becomes a blockbuster, the big pharma realizes a huge return on a relatively cheap deal. The possibility of this kind of alpha has traditionally incentivized buyers to prefer proprietary, quiet deal processes (few competitors). It's analogous to how certain investors profit in opaque markets - e.g., bond dealers earning large bid-ask spreads before electronic trading.

Moving to a transparent marketplace flips this dynamic. With multiple bidders and open (or at least broader) visibility, price discovery becomes more efficient. A seller's asset will tend toward the true market-clearing price that reflects collective assessment of its value. This inevitably means **compressed margins for buyers** - no one buyer can consistently get a steal if many others are evaluating the same data. As one comparison, when private equity shares started trading in secondary markets, the discounts shrank because more buyers could bid 23. Or consider IPOs: under the old opaque bookbuilding, underwriters intentionally underpriced IPOs so that their clients (buyers) could get a day-one pop (alpha), whereas an auction-based IPO tends to reduce underpricing, meaning the issuer (seller) captures more value. In pharma licensing, today's underpricing is seen in things like hefty investor reactions when a company announces a licensing deal - sometimes the stock jumps 100% because the market believes the asset was worth far more than the deal implied (i.e. the buyer got a bargain). In a transparent auction, that bargain would be arbitraged away by competing bids.

**The trade-off:** Deal margins per transaction versus overall volume and value. Buyers lose some alpha per deal (they pay more on average, closer to "fair" value), and sellers gain a higher share of the value. However, because the friction is lower and trust in pricing is higher, many more assets will come to market that otherwise wouldn't. The **aggregate throughput of deals increases**, which can compensate all players.

7

Investors who used to chase 3 or 4 bilateral deals a year might now participate in 10 marketplace auctions a year, each with slightly lower ROI individually but a reliable pipeline of opportunities. Meanwhile sellers who might shelve an asset (zero value) now complete a deal for, say, $50M - a smaller margin for the buyer, but a win-win since the alternative was often no deal at all. Markets with thinner margins but higher velocity can create more total value. We saw this in the bond market with MarketAxess: dealers saw bid-ask spreads tighten (their per-trade profit fell) once clients could easily check competing quotes, but electronic trading volume exploded, and MarketAxess itself took a small cut of a much larger flow 23. A similar pattern happened in programmatic ads – media buying agencies could no longer get hidden kickbacks as easily, but the total digital ad pie grew immensely once trading became efficient.

There is also a **philosophical shift:** from relationship-driven dealmaking (where who you know and negotiating prowess dictate outcomes) to **data-driven dealmaking** (where assets trade closer to an objective value). Some incumbent bankers or investors may resist at first, since their edge in the old system is being eroded. But over time, most markets evolve toward transparency because it unlocks scale. Consider that even investment banks eventually embraced open IPO pricing for mega-deals or that real estate agents now work within Zillow's highly informed market - the volume and client demand forces the change. In biotech, as more success stories emerge of companies selling or licensing assets via marketplace at good valuations, staying off-market will seem foolish (just as selling your house off-market now is rare, since you likely get a better price by listing it broadly).

Notably, **investors may still find alpha in a transparent system, but it shifts to new areas.** Instead of alpha from information asymmetry, they get alpha from speed (being quick to bid), from superior analysis (interpreting the standardized data better than others), or from creative deal structures (perhaps bundling assets or offering partnership terms that others can't). Also, marketplaces can offer **tiered participation:** for instance, perhaps deals run in two phases – a limited preview to select parties (with certain credentials or high reputation scores) and then a wider auction if not taken. This can preserve some advantages for knowledgeable players while still expanding access overall.

A useful analogy drawn in the prompt is the **“IPO bookbuilding vs. auction"** debate. In bookbuilding, bankers quietly gather bids and set an IPO price, often below what true demand would allow (resulting in the typical first-day stock price pop – a transfer of value to the new shareholders). In auctions (like Google's IPO in 2004), a wider pool of investors submit bids and the price is set where supply meets demand, theoretically eliminating most underpricing. Empirically, auctions have seen mixed adoption in IPOs due to concerns like winner's curse and volatile pricing 24 25, but the parallel is illustrative: a Prudentia marketplace might employ modified auction mechanisms to ensure broad participation yet stable outcomes (e.g. reserve prices, or allowing sellers to choose the best partner not just the best price, etc., injecting a bit of bookbuilding flavor). This hybrid approach can ease the transition for an industry used to relationship nuance.

In conclusion, **transparency will shift some value from buyers to sellers on a per-deal basis, but it greatly enlarges the pie by bringing more assets to market and attracting more capital overall.** The role of Prudentia as marketplace operator is to make this trade-off attractive: provide enough transparency and standardization that new buyers and sellers flood in, but also offer tools (data analytics, curation, private bid options) that sophisticated participants still feel they can achieve their goals on the platform. If done right, the result should be compressed individual deal margins but higher aggregate returns – akin to how a high-frequency trading firm makes small spreads on lots of trades rather than huge spreads on a few.

Biopharma will benefit because more drugs will get a chance at development, and Prudentia will benefit by taking a transaction fee or subscription for facilitating a far greater number of deals than occur today.

## Novartis as a Case Study: Portfolio Discipline and the Need for Market Rails

To illustrate how a marketplace might be used in practice, consider **Novartis**, one of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies, which in recent years has exemplified a more disciplined, **portfolio-optimized approach** to R&D. Novartis has publicly embraced the mantra of focusing on high-value assets and shedding those that don't meet its strategic or commercial criteria. In 2023, Novartis announced it would **discontinue or out-license ~10% of its R&D projects** after a rigorous review of each program's strategic fit and sales potential 12. Many of the cut programs were in oncology sub-areas that were no longer priorities, or were using approaches that the company felt others could better pursue 26. This kind of systematic pruning is historically unusual in big pharma (who often kept pipelines fat), but it reflects a new reality: Novartis is effectively saying "if a project can't reasonably become a multi-billion dollar product in our hands, we are better off selling or killing it."

At the same time, Novartis is doubling down on fewer core areas and making **targeted acquisitions and licensing deals** to bolster those areas. CEO Vas Narasimhan narrowed Novartis's focus to five therapeutic areas (Cardio, Immunology, Neuroscience, Solid Tumors, Hematology) 13 and spun off non-core businesses (e.g. the Alcon eye care division in 2019, the Sandoz generics division in 2023). In 2019, Novartis paid $9.7B to acquire The Medicines Co., gaining inclisiran (a cholesterol-lowering drug with multi-billion sales potential) 27 28 – an example of paying top dollar for a single high-value asset to strengthen the cardiovascular franchise. They also did an $8.7B deal for AveXis to get a gene therapy for SMA 29, and numerous smaller licensing deals. More recently, Novartis has signaled it expects each of its key pipeline assets to have "multi-billion dollar peak sales" potential, and it has not shied away from terminating programs that don't measure up (for instance, halting a Huntington's disease program in Phase III due to insufficient benefit). This **high bar ($2B+ sales) approach** 6 ensures internal resources are concentrated on future blockbusters or significant "platform" assets. But it also creates a surplus of decent assets that someone could develop – they're just not blockbusters.

**How would Novartis use a platform like Prudentia?** In two ways: as a seller and as a buyer. As a seller, Novartis could take those pruned programs (the 10% it cut) and list them on the marketplace for out-licensing or sale, rather than quietly discontinuing them. Historically, when big pharmas cut projects, they might shop a few via their business development teams, but many simply fade away because finding the right partner is hard. If a marketplace existed with hundreds of biotech and mid-pharma buyers, Novartis could quickly get multiple offers for a shelved asset – perhaps a smaller company would see a Phase I compound as a great strategic fit even if Novartis doesn't. This is essentially turning what is now an informal, months-long search (often handled by investment bankers via a “book” sent to select companies) into a structured exchange where assets are discoverable. It's easy to imagine Novartis posting a detailed (but anonymized) profile of an asset on Prudentia's platform, allowing interested qualified buyers under NDA to access the data package, and then running a competitive bidding or partner selection process through the platform's tools. The benefits to Novartis: **speed, efficiency, and perhaps better economics.** Instead of its BD team spending a year to maybe find one partner, they could see market interest in weeks. Even if the asset fetches a modest deal, that's non-dilutive capital back and one less program for Novartis to worry about, aligning with the CFO's capital recycling goals 9.

9

As a buyer, Novartis could leverage the marketplace to **augment its pipeline with external innovation in a systematic way.** Narasimhan has been vocal that a significant portion of new products will come from external sources. Indeed, Novartis's internal R&D plus external deals have led it to project ~30 "high-value" pipeline projects driving 6%+ CAGR through 2028 30. On a platform like Prudentia, Novartis's scouts could filter for, say, “Phase II oncology assets in immunotherapy with at least $1B peak sales potential" or for cutting-edge gene therapy platform opportunities. Rather than relying purely on their network or bankers bringing them deals, they would have a dashboard of available opportunities. It's akin to how large companies now use marketplaces (like Axial or others) to see a funnel of M&A opportunities rather than waiting for an investment bank's call. Novartis might particularly appreciate the **data-driven valuations provided by Prudentia.** For instance, if Prudentia's AI models suggest an asset could do $2.5B in peak sales in an optimal scenario, that flags it as meeting Novartis's threshold. We know Novartis even created an internal "challenger" team (led by ex-analyst Ronny Gal) to push commercial thinking earlier 31 – a Prudentia marketplace complements that by providing external market validation of an asset's potential (if multiple bidders are interested, this is a positive signal).

Additionally, Novartis could use the platform for **structured deals like spin-outs.** In 2020, Novartis helped launch Anthos Therapeutics by licensing out a cardiovascular antibody to a newco backed by Blackstone, retaining a stake 32 33. A marketplace could make such transactions more routine by connecting pharma assets with investors who want to form a new company around them (the marketplace acting as the meeting ground for pharma, VCs, and management teams). This creates flexibility: rather than outright selling an asset, Novartis could list it for a spin-out proposal and see if any venture group wants to fund it externally (Novartis keeps an equity piece). That's essentially an **auction of deal structures**, which a sophisticated platform could handle (one bidder might offer $X million upfront for full rights, another offers to create a joint venture with milestones, etc., and the seller picks which model/value they prefer).

In summary, **Novartis's behavior foreshadows the value of Prudentia's marketplace.** They are publishing commercial criteria early, pruning non-core assets, and actively seeking external innovation – but today they do this with significant manual effort and transaction friction. A platform providing liquidity and standardization would be a force multiplier for their strategy. It would help Novartis more smoothly execute the **"prune and acquire" cycle:** prune assets and quickly monetize them via the marketplace (instead of letting them die), and scan the marketplace to acquire or license the best external candidates to fill pipeline gaps. If even a top pharma like Novartis stands to benefit, consider the many other organizations (smaller pharmas, biotechs, academia) that lack Novartis's huge BD team - for them, an open marketplace could be transformative, essentially outsourcing their BD function to a platform. Novartis serves as a case study indicating that the market demand for such "rails" is there, awaiting a facilitator like Prudentia.

## Liquidity Unlocks New Financial Products

One of the underappreciated advantages of creating a liquid market for pharma assets is the potential to develop **entirely new financial products and investment vehicles** linked to drug programs. When an asset class becomes more tradable and standardized, it opens the door to **innovation in how risk is shared and capital is raised.** We've seen this in other markets: once mortgages were standardized, mortgage-backed securities and REITs emerged; once stocks were widely traded, index funds and options proliferated; once carbon credits gained liquidity, futures and structured carbon notes came about. A

10

mature pharma asset marketplace could similarly give rise to new instruments that further accelerate innovation funding. Here are a few possibilities:

*   **Pooled Royalty Funds / Securitization:** Instead of (or in addition to) single-asset royalties being sold, a platform could facilitate pooling multiple royalties or drug revenue streams into one vehicle. In fact, the concept isn't entirely new – the first patent/royalty securitization was done in 2000 (by Royalty Pharma) and drew significant academic attention 34. In that deal, a portfolio of drug royalty cash flows was bundled and financial securities were issued against them, allowing investors to buy slices of the pool. A Prudentia marketplace could make assembling such pools easier, by providing standardized data and contracts for each royalty in the bundle. For example, a "Phase III Oncology Royalty Fund" could be created by taking pieces of royalties from 10 late-stage cancer drugs listed on the platform. Investors could buy shares in this fund to get diversified exposure to oncology successes, and sellers get liquidity without giving up 100% of any single royalty. This concept spreads risk (since any one drug might fail, but not all likely will) and could attract more conservative capital (pension funds, etc.) into providing drug financing. The platform's role would be crucial in **standardizing how royalties are valued and combined**, and in handling the legal structuring (akin to how mortgage pools became easier once data standards like FICO scores and tranching structures were established).

*   **Milestone Futures or Options:** In pharma deals, big payments are often tied to milestones (e.g. $50M when a trial completes, $100M on FDA approval). Currently, those milestones are binary and non-tradable - you either are the company that will receive it or not. But a marketplace could enable **derivative contracts on milestones.** For instance, investors could buy a right to a portion of a milestone payment, effectively betting that the milestone will be achieved. The seller (original asset owner) gets some money upfront (selling the contingent claim at a discount), and the buyer gets a high-risk/high-reward bet. This is analogous to **futures or options:** you could have an option that pays out if Drug X is approved by 2027. Such instruments would allow risk transfer – a biotech could offload some risk of failure and get capital now, while an investor who specializes in, say, clinical development risk could take that bet. Over time, if many such milestone-based instruments exist, you might even see **"event-driven" traders** specializing in pharma outcomes, similar to how weather derivatives or sports betting markets function. It requires liquidity and some standardization (perhaps using probability of technical success as a guide to pricing). A marketplace could list standardized milestone contracts (like "Phase 3 success of compound Y - contract pays $1 if success, $0 if fail"), and traders could buy/sell based on their view. While this sounds exotic, it could dramatically improve capital efficiency - essentially letting companies hedge R&D risk and investors provide insurance. It parallels how structured products in carbon markets or insurance-linked securities developed once underlying markets matured.

*   **Therapeutic Area or Index-Based Securities:** If enough assets trade on the platform, one can envision creating **indexes or ETFs** that track a basket of drug assets. For example, an "Oncology Development Index" that maybe takes an equal-weighted interest in all oncology assets listed in a given period. Investors in such an index wouldn't need to pick individual winners; they'd be betting on oncology as a whole advancing (the index would gain value if a decent fraction of those assets succeed or get acquired at premiums). This is analogous to stock indices or ETFs – easy for investors to access a sector without single-name risk. It could also be similar to **VC fund-of-funds or mutual funds** but in a more liquid, transparent wrapper. Another approach is **royalty indices** - e.g., tracking the average yield of pharma royalties as an asset class (similar to how MarketAxess created indices

11

for corporate bond spreads 35). If Prudentia's marketplace grows, it could publish indices like "Phase II Neuroscience Asset Index" that reflect the composite value changes of that category over time. These indices could be used by institutional investors as benchmarks or even trading vehicles (with futures contracts on them). The benefit is bringing more institutional capital into drug development, as they can invest at the index level rather than selecting individual biotechs or products.

*   **Tokenization and Fractional Ownership:** The prompt mentions tokenization, and indeed, making assets more liquid can extend to fractional ownership by a broad base of investors. By 2034, blockchain-based IP monetization is expected to be the fastest-growing segment in this space 36. This suggests a future where a drug asset's ownership or royalty streams could be broken into digital tokens and traded. While there are regulatory and practical hurdles, a marketplace that standardizes legal agreements makes tokenization easier - essentially each token represents a slice of a revenue stream or IP bundle under a smart contract. This could allow even retail investors to own a tiny piece of a drug's future royalties (much like some platforms let people buy fractional shares of music royalties or real estate). The immediate benefit is vastly expanded capital sources. Imagine a promising rare disease drug that needs $30M to run a trial – instead of one pharma or VC, perhaps 10,000 individuals each chip in a few thousand via buying tokens that give them a pro-rata royalty if the drug succeeds. Tokenization, combined with a robust marketplace, could create a new paradigm of **crowd-powered drug development financing**, all underpinned by transparent data so those individuals are informed.

*   **Structured Financing Products:** As liquidity grows, banks and funds will likely create **bespoke financing** around these assets. For example, a bank might offer a loan secured by a company's portfolio of listed drug assets (knowing they can be sold on the marketplace if needed – increasing collateral value). Or a hedge fund might arbitrage between the private market on Prudentia and public market biotech valuations (if an asset is trading cheaply on the platform relative to comparable public biotech stocks, the fund could buy the asset and short the overvalued comps). These kinds of strategies emerge naturally once an asset class trades more like a commodity. We might also see **pharma-focused SPACs or investment companies** that raise money to specifically acquire assets via the marketplace, essentially acting as program aggregators. The marketplace could facilitate **auction-based financings** too - e.g., a biotech lists that it seeks $X funding for Y% royalty on its product, and investors bid the lowest royalty percent they'd accept (like an interest rate auction). This mirrors what C2FO does for invoices (bidding on discount rates) and could drastically reduce the cost of capital for biotechs by harnessing competition.

The overarching point is that **liquidity begets liquidity.** Once assets can trade, creative minds will develop new ways to slice, combine, insure, and invest in those assets. This tends to be a virtuous cycle: new financial products bring in new types of investors (who might have different risk appetites - e.g., pension funds might like pooled royalty bonds, hedge funds might like milestone derivatives), which increases the liquidity further and lowers cost of capital for drug development. There are certainly risks to guard against – financialization can lead to bubbles or misaligned incentives (one must be careful that trading instruments don't incentivize bad science or short-termism). However, properly managed (with regulatory oversight and ethical frameworks), these innovations could channel vast global capital into biopharma R&D, far beyond the traditional VC and big-pharma budgets. In carbon markets, structured products helped unlock billions for climate projects; in pharma, they could unlock billions for curing diseases.

12

Prudentia's role would be to provide the **platform and rule-set** enabling these products, while perhaps initially focusing on simpler ones (like pooled funds or indexes). By being a first-mover, it could establish itself as the **foundation for pharma finance innovation** – much as ICE did for energy or CME did for derivatives. Importantly, Prudentia can derive additional revenue streams here (for instance, fees for creating and managing an index or SPV fund) beyond the core transaction fees, and these products deepen the moat by embedding the platform in the financial fabric of the industry.

## Impact on R&D Productivity

A core promise of a pharma asset marketplace is that it will actually increase the **productivity of R&D on a macro level.** This goes beyond just making money - it speaks to more drugs making it to patients and less waste in the system. There are several mechanisms by which an active marketplace would improve R&D output:

1.  **Fewer Stranded Assets (Faster Deal Cycles):** In today's model, if a big company shelves a project or a biotech can't raise funds, that asset often sits idle until patents expire - a complete loss of all the prior R&D investment and potential patient benefit. With a marketplace, those assets can be quickly redeployed. Faster deal cycles mean if Company A isn't advancing a drug, it can transfer it to Company B within months rather than the drug languishing for years. This directly reduces the number of stranded (but viable) assets. It's essentially reducing the downtime of assets. Just like a piece of equipment sitting unused is waste, a drug candidate sitting on a shelf is a lost opportunity. By finding new owners faster, the marketplace increases the chance that a drug will eventually succeed under someone's stewardship. An illustrative statistic from an HBS study: large pharma projects that were out-licensed to startups (“big-to-startup” transfers) were significantly more likely to advance to the next phase and to approval than projects that remained in-house and never licensed 37 38. This suggests many shelved projects are not scientific failures - they just needed the right home. If we can systematically re-home such projects via a platform, overall drug output should rise. In essence, one company's discard can be another's golden nugget – a marketplace makes that handoff efficient.

2.  **Better Matching of Assets to Owners (Higher Success Rates):** Different organizations have different strengths. A drug that doesn't fit one company's strategy might be perfectly aligned with another's expertise. For example, a big pharma might shelve a niche indication that a specialty biotech would be thrilled to focus on. By improving the matchmaking between assets and developers, the probability of technical and regulatory success (PTRS) should improve. The right owner will design better trials, avoid mistakes, and apply the needed resources. The HBS study mentioned above attributes improved outcomes partly to human capital moving with projects – when a project is licensed to a startup, often some scientists or experts transfer too, bringing knowledge and passion 39. A marketplace facilitates not just asset transfers, but potentially talent and know-how transfers (since an acquiring entity might also pick up team members or consultants familiar with the project). Moreover, if buyers can be found who truly value the asset (e.g. it complements their platform or fills their pipeline gap), they will prioritize it, whereas in its original home it was a low priority. All this means higher likelihood that the asset succeeds clinically and commercially under the new owner. The industry's overall R&D efficiency (measured as outputs per dollar in) could improve if assets systematically flow to the parties that value them most and can develop them best - which is exactly what an efficient market tends to do.

3.  **Virtuous Cycle of Capital Redeployment:** When a company can sell an asset that doesn't fit, it gains capital that can be put back into research or acquisition of other assets. This **recycling of capital** means

13

R&D funding is used where it's most effective. Alis Biosciences' founder noted that freeing trapped capital is crucial to financing new science 9 – the marketplace is the tool to free that capital by turning dormant assets into cash via transactions. For big pharma, selling a non-core asset might generate a non-dilutive influx of say $100M, which could fund several higher-priority programs or be returned to shareholders who reinvest elsewhere in biotech. For small biotechs, monetizing a program (instead of just discontinuing it) can extend their runway to develop other drugs in their pipeline. In aggregate, this means less money is wasted on dead-ends and more is concentrated on promising leads. Capital efficiency in biotech R&D has historically been low (studies often cite <5% IRRs for pharma R&D portfolios); improving liquidity directly addresses part of this issue. If every project finds its optimal funding source and owner, fewer projects die purely from lack of funds or misalignment, which is a gain for society.

4.  **Shorter Timelines to Development:** A marketplace could shorten the time a drug spends in limbo. Currently, if a biotech runs out of money, its asset might sit for a year or more while they seek partners, or worse, go through bankruptcy proceedings. In a marketplace scenario, that biotech could list the asset preemptively and perhaps transact it within a few months, meaning the new owner continues development with minimal delay. Similarly, if a pharma decides to terminate a program internally, it could immediately list it rather than waiting quarters to see if it can be revived internally. Every month saved is meaningful given patents are ticking and patients are waiting. Cumulatively, if a marketplace knocked even 6-12 months off the typical asset transfer timeline industry-wide, that translates to many life-years saved and revenue gained that otherwise would be lost to delays.

5.  **Increased Overall Innovation and Funding:** The existence of a vibrant marketplace can itself spur more innovation. Inventors know there is a path to monetization even if they can't take a drug all the way - they could advance it to proof-of-concept and then reliably sell or license it via the platform. This "exit route" encourages early-stage innovation (similar to how the promise of acquisition or IPO drives startup creation in tech). It could also attract new kinds of investors to drug R&D if they see that assets are liquid. For example, more angel investors or smaller funds might back drug discovery startups if they know an asset can be sold on a platform at Phase I (rather than requiring an IPO or large Pharma deal which are rarer). Essentially, liquidity lowers the risk of investing in innovation because you're not locked in for a decade – you have optionality to sell. More investment in early R&D should increase the shots on goal, and thus the chances of breakthrough therapies emerging.

6.  **Knowledge Spillovers and Data Transparency:** A subtler point is that a marketplace by necessity involves sharing data in a standardized way. Over time, this creates a **rich dataset of what works, what fails, and how assets are valued.** Prudentia's platform could become a repository of industry benchmarks (like how many Phase II assets in dermatology with certain data are valued). This transparency of outcomes and pricing could improve decision-making. Firms can benchmark their own programs against market comps, potentially avoiding investing in doomed projects if the market sentiment is poor. Also, when assets transfer, often publications or data eventually become public (the new owner might publish results that the old owner would have buried). This contributes to scientific knowledge - fewer negative or inconclusive results stuck in file drawers. Overall, a culture of trading assets might promote more openness, as opposed to the secrecy around many terminated programs today. Openness can prevent duplicated failures and channel efforts to more promising science.

Empirical evidence supports some of these claims: The licensing study we cited demonstrated improved innovation outcomes when assets moved from big pharma to startups 37 38. We also see anecdotal evidence: many successful drugs were once shelved and then saved by another company (e.g.,

14

azidothymidine for HIV was a shelved cancer drug; Keytruda was nearly discontinued at Merck before a new team championed it, etc.). A marketplace could make such salvation stories more common rather than a matter of luck or heroic internal advocacy.

From a macro perspective, if Prudentia's marketplace enables even a few extra drugs per year to reach patients that otherwise would have died on the vine, the public health impact is immense. For R&D organizations, it also changes mindset: programs are assets, not just sunk-cost projects. Knowing there is a market, researchers might design trials not only to satisfy internal stakeholders but also with an eye toward making the asset attractive to others (e.g., collecting data that external partners value, etc.). This could improve the quality of R&D planning.

In conclusion, the platform's effect on R&D productivity is to **increase the yield of useful drugs per dollar spent** by reducing waste (fewer abandoned assets and idle capital) and improving match quality. It smooths out the allocation of resources across the ecosystem: great science in academia or biotech can more easily find its way to a commercializer, and large companies can refocus without simply throwing away what they can't pursue. If the pharmaceutical industry can meaningfully boost its R&D productivity (even from ~2 new drugs per 10 projects to 3 per 10, hypothetically), that's a multi-billion-dollar and multi-life-saving impact. Prudentia's marketplace can be a catalyst for that change by acting as the circulatory system of the biopharma innovation economy, ensuring every viable asset and every dollar finds the right opportunity.

## $1B EV Path for Prudentia

How can Prudentia, as a business, capture this opportunity and translate it into a $1B+ enterprise value? This final section outlines a feasible financial roadmap, including revenue streams, scaling assumptions, and how strategic choices yield a durable high-multiple business.

**Revenue Model Evolution:** Prudentia's current incarnation as an AI-driven diligence platform likely earns revenue in a SaaS or enterprise software model (annual subscriptions, pilots, etc.). As it layers on the marketplace functionality, new revenue streams emerge:
-   **SaaS/Platform ARR:** Continued subscription fees from pharma and biotech clients using Prudentia's software for asset evaluations, portfolio analytics, etc. This could grow to dozens of large pharma/biotech clients paying substantial annual licenses for access to the platform and its data. If Prudentia captures, say, 50 big companies at $1M each and 100 smaller firms at $200k each, that's on the order of **$50-100M in Annual Recurring Revenue** for the software side. This recurring base is important for stability and valuation (investors love recurring revenue).
-   **Transaction Fees ("Take Rate"):** As the marketplace facilitates deals, Prudentia can charge a commission or success fee. Many marketplaces take anywhere from 1-10% of transaction value depending on the industry. Pharma deals can be large (tens of millions upfront, plus milestones). If Prudentia is involved in, say, $1B worth of transactions per year (which might be a few dozen mid-sized deals or a mix of big and small), even a 5% average take yields $50M. The prompt's target of $60-90M from transaction fees suggests an annual deal volume on the platform in the ballpark of $1-2B (not unrealistic if you include a couple of sizable licensing deals plus many smaller ones). Importantly, transaction revenues are somewhat episodic, but with enough volume they become steady in aggregate. They also scale with industry trends - e.g., if more biotechs are selling assets in a downturn, volume could spike. A neutral platform might also generate fees from both sides (e.g., charging the seller a listing fee and the buyer a success fee, or providing premium services for faster diligence).
-   **Optional SPV/Underwriting Revenue:** Prudentia might occasionally step in to facilitate an SPV (special purpose vehicle) to acquire an asset (especially early on to "seed" the marketplace when not all buyers are on it yet). In these cases, Prudentia could earn fees like a fund manager (2% management fee,

15

20% carry on the SPV profits) or an underwriting spread if it buys and flips an asset. This is akin to Cartax which at one point acted as the broker-dealer for some trades. If Prudentia does, say, a couple of these deals a year and earns $5-10M each in fees/carry, that could be **$20-30M annually.** It's not the core model (and does carry some balance sheet risk), but it can boost revenue and demonstrate marketplace viability before pure-play volume picks up. Eventually, as liquidity deepens, Prudentia might do less principal activity, or only in areas where doing so kickstarts a new product (like the first pooled fund, etc., where it acts as GP).

Summing these, one can envisage **$120M-180M total revenue at scale** (say in 5-7 years), composed of ~$70M from recurring software and ~$70M from marketplace-related activities on average (midpoint of given ranges). Achieving this would make Prudentia comparable to certain fintech or SaaS companies that have garnered high valuations. For context, public “pharma tech” companies trade at premium multiples given their sticky business and tailwinds 40. It's not unreasonable to use an **8-12× EV/Revenue multiple** for a high-growth, network-effect platform like this (some pure software trade even higher; marketplaces often around 10x if growing >30% annually). Applying, say, a 10x multiple to $150M revenue yields a $1.5B enterprise value. Even at the low end of 8× on $120M, that's ~$960M (just shy of $1B), and at the high end 12x on $180M is $2.16B. So **>$1B is attainable in that range.**

Investors will award such multiples if they see Prudentia not just as a consulting or one-off services firm, but as a **scalable platform with network effects and a long growth runway.** Key to this perception (and reality) is Prudentia's **moat**:
-   **Standardization & Data Network:** By being the first to standardize how pharma assets are described, valued, and transacted, Prudentia can become the industry standard. If its format for an "asset dossier" or its risk model (PTRS/NPV calculations) becomes widely accepted, every deal - even those off-platform - might reference it. That creates a self-reinforcing loop: sellers prepare assets to Prudentia standards so that they can tap the largest pool of buyers; buyers come to Prudentia because that's where assets are presented in a reliable, comparable way. Much like Veeva became the standard for clinical data management in pharma, embedding itself deeply, Prudentia can become the standard for asset transactions. This confers a **workflow lock-in** – pharma BD teams might use Prudentia's interface daily to scout or benchmark, making it hard to displace (similar to how bankers live on Bloomberg terminals for market info).
-   **Liquidity and Network Effects:** Marketplaces are classic network effect businesses – more buyers attract more sellers and vice versa. Once Prudentia achieves critical mass (even in a niche, like oncology deals or royalty sales), it will have an advantage that new entrants can't easily replicate. Liquidity begets liquidity; if Prudentia can say "list with us, we have 100 active buyer organizations ready,” most sellers won't bother trying elsewhere. Early on, it may have to work hard to build this network (perhaps facilitating some anchor transactions or forging partnerships with a few top pharmas to list surplus assets). But after a tipping point, the network effect is a powerful moat. An upstart competitor would face a catch-22 of no buyers -> no sellers and vice versa. Additionally, data liquidity (the accumulated database of asset benchmarks, outcomes, buyer preferences) compounds over time and stays with Prudentia, improving its matchmaking and valuation algorithms. This could become proprietary IP that others lack.

-   **Workflow Integration & Switching Costs:** Prudentia can entrench itself by integrating into the end-to-end workflow of asset diligence and deal execution. If pharma companies use Prudentia from the early evaluation stage (e.g. generating Integrated Product Profiles, valuing their own pipeline) and then seamlessly transition to using it for outreach and deal-making, it becomes an indispensable tool - much like Salesforce is for sales pipelines. Over years, Prudentia might also handle the post-deal tracking (like managing royalties, milestones via smart contracts). This creates high switching costs; even if an alternate marketplace appears, companies would hesitate to move if all their historical data and processes live in Prudentia. The mention of workflow capture in the prompt is apt

16

-   capturing the business process (from analysis to transaction to post-deal management) means the platform isn't just a listing service, it's part of how a company runs BD and portfolio management.

-   **Trust and Brand:** Especially in pharma, reputation is critical. If Prudentia is known as the neutral, **trusted intermediary** that consistently delivers value, it will hold a position similar to an exchange or a rating agency. Building this trust involves robust confidentiality protections, quality control (avoiding low-quality or dubious assets flooding the platform), and perhaps curating a bit to ensure successful transactions. Over time, a Prudentia "seal of approval" on an asset (meaning it's been diligenced and listed) could carry weight. That brand trust is a moat – if buyers trust Prudentia's data more than a copycat's, they'll stick with it.

Financially, the margin profile of such a business is attractive: SaaS revenue is high gross margin (~80%+), and marketplace commission revenue, after some initial cost of building the platform, is also high margin (the platform scales without proportional cost). This yields the "marketplace/infra" multiple mentioned (8-12x) based on the combination of growth and profitability potential. Many fintech marketplaces (like MarketAxess, Tradeweb in bonds, etc.) trade at healthy multiples because once established they are cash-generative toll booths on large transaction flows. Investors in Prudentia will likely also factor in **strategic value** - it could become an acquisition target itself by a large exchange (like NASDAQ, which has shown interest in alternative assets) or a major data provider. But assuming it stays independent, one can see a path to an IPO or late-stage valuation north of $1B if the metrics above are hit.

Let's sanity-check the volume assumptions behind $120-180M revenue: The biopharma BD/licensing market is huge - on the order of $50B in deals annually (including M&A, licensing, options). If Prudentia intermediates even a fraction, say 2-3%, that's $1-1.5B in deal value. So the pie is large; it's more about execution and adoption. Also, **capturing a percentage of industry spend is explicitly the goal:** if Prudentia influences allocation of “hundreds of millions to $1B+" of R&D capital, it can "capture a percentage of that spend to build a large business" 41. This was noted in Virtue's investment memo – the idea that shaping large budget decisions yields commensurate revenue. It means if big pharma collectively spends $10B on external assets and Prudentia is the platform for a chunk of that, skimming 1% is $100M. That doesn't account for the software value-add on top. So yes, a billion-dollar outcome is plausible if Prudentia becomes embedded in the deal value chain.

To achieve this, **strategic trade-offs must be managed.** Prudentia should likely prioritize the **marketplace development over short-term consulting revenue**, even if it means initially doing more hands-on facilitation to ensure deals close (building credibility). It may need to subsidize some early transactions (low fees or even making investments) to get the flywheel going. But these are classic marketplace launch tactics. Once momentum is there, network effects kick in.

In summary, Prudentia's path to a $1B+ EV involves scaling to roughly $150M revenue with a balanced mix of recurring platform fees and transaction-based income. The market conditions support this - pharma is actively looking for solutions (pharma tech comps trade at a premium 40 and there are known billion-dollar exits in the space 42). By leveraging its early mover advantage, delivering unique value (AI-driven diligence + marketplace), and entrenching itself in workflows, Prudentia can command an attractive multiple. Perhaps most importantly, the **"moat"** – a combination of data standardization, network liquidity, and integration into pharma processes - will make that enterprise value durable. It won't just be a hype cycle valuation; it will be based on Prudentia being the indispensable infrastructure that the industry relies on, much like how certain exchanges or data platforms become utility-like in importance. That durability, in turn, could even

17

expand the multiple (if seen as the next "Veeva of BD" or the "MarketAxess of pharma," valuations could push higher).

## Conclusion

The biopharma industry is undergoing structural changes that demand new solutions. As the blockbuster era recedes and R&D inefficiencies come to a head, the traditional model of internally developing or idly shelving assets is breaking down. Companies need ways to continually remix their portfolios – to **monetize what they can't use and acquire what they need** - in a far more dynamic fashion than ever before. Prudentia Sciences, by transforming from a smart diligence tool into a **full-fledged transaction marketplace**, is seizing this moment.

**Macro trends** like the patent cliff, the surge of "zombie" biotechs, and the rise of data/AI in pharma all converge to make a marketplace not only feasible but necessary. The timing (Why Now) analysis showed that both the supply of assets (from portfolio pruning and struggling biotechs) and the demand for assets (from big pharmas facing growth gaps) are increasing. Yet, without a marketplace, much of that supply and demand fails to connect efficiently. Prudentia's opportunity is to be the **catalyst that brings liquidity and transparency**, turning an ad-hoc art into a repeatable process.

**Industry analogies** reinforce that this playbook can work – other sectors have unlocked enormous value by introducing marketplaces for formerly illiquid assets. Whether it's Carta enabling a wave of secondary liquidity in venture-backed companies, or MarketAxess revolutionizing bond trading, the precedent is clear: **build the infrastructure, and the market will follow.** Biopharma may be complex, but it's not exempt from these fundamental economics. In fact, one could argue the stakes are higher - what gets traded here are not just financial instruments, but potentially life-saving cures. A more efficient market means faster development and distribution of those cures.

**Trade-offs** like transparency vs. alpha are real, but the analysis indicates the net outcome is positive for the ecosystem. Yes, some investors or firms that thrived on opaque deals might see margin compression, but they too benefit from the greater volume and the ability to redeploy capital quickly. It's a classic case of "growing the pie." Moreover, the **cultural shift** towards open-market thinking in pharma could spur more collaboration and innovation, moving away from zero-sum mentalities. As sellers realize they can capture more value on a platform and buyers realize they can't rely on information hiding, both will adapt - likely towards even more sophisticated valuation and risk-sharing methods, many facilitated by Prudentia.

**Prudentia's specific opportunity is immense:** it can become the default platform for pharma business development, akin to a global exchange for drug assets. Achieving a $1B+ enterprise value is not just a vanity metric - it would signify that Prudentia has established a sustainable business model with significant market share in this new arena. By our roadmap, that comes from a balanced revenue mix of software ARR and marketplace commissions, underpinned by a powerful network effect. The notion of a durable **moat** built on standardization, workflow integration, and liquidity was emphasized because in the long run, those are what will protect Prudentia from competitors and ensure it remains the market leader. If Prudentia can capture the workflows of Novartis and its peers, provide the data backbone for asset decisions, and host the transactions themselves, it will be deeply embedded in the industry – much harder to dislodge than a point-solution tech tool.

Zooming out, the vision is compelling: a world where a pharma asset can find its best path to market efficiently, where financing flows to the programs with the best chance of success (not just those with the flashiest story or most connected founders), and where companies large and small can be nimble in structuring their R&D portfolios. It's a world where potentially fewer drugs "die on the vine" due to lack of funding or misaligned ownership. Prudentia's marketplace alone won't solve all R&D productivity issues, but it could eliminate a lot of friction that currently holds the industry back. It essentially creates a **meta-innovation** - an innovation in how we commercialize and fund innovation itself.

Execution will be key. Prudentia must gain trust through early wins (perhaps starting with facilitating a few high-profile licensing deals or royalty sales to show proof of concept). It should leverage its AI diligence strength to ensure that listed assets come with credible, detailed profiles (making the marketplace curated and not a junkyard). Partnering with influential players (like a pilot with Novartis or a consortium of biopharma) could accelerate adoption. And it should continue to enhance its predictive analytics, because if Prudentia can better predict which assets are worth $2B+, it can essentially create alpha for everyone in a transparent way, which is the best of both worlds.

In closing, **the path to a $1B+ EV for Prudentia is aligned with delivering tangible value to the pharma ecosystem.** By solving real problems – illiquidity, inefficiency, and information gaps – Prudentia can become a linchpin of the industry's future infrastructure. The market context, analogies, and strategy we've examined all point to a significant whitespace ready to be filled. If Prudentia successfully fills it, the impact will be measured not only in its valuation, but in an industry that is more financially and scientifically vibrant. As Virtue's investment thesis noted, pharma is a space where "multiple $1B+ outcomes" are possible for those who harness the tailwinds 40. Prudentia has the ingredients to be one of those outcomes – by bringing the power of marketplaces to pharma and in doing so, accelerating the next generation of medical breakthroughs.
