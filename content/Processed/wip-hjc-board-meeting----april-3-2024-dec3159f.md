Highlights and lowlights

**What is going well?**

Retention and satisfaction of activated members remains strong
- Avg LTV 26 sessions across cohorts
- Some of our pilot initiatives driving session 5 retention from 66% to 92% with wayfinding
- Satisfaction of Journeyers remains high
- Clear appetite for more spend depth → 10% signed up for additional services, D&D led to 52% ARPU increase

Strong supply-side market
- Therapist side of market has not had issues scaling up
- Clinical impact and research partnerships going well

Rapid iteration and learning from Q1 experiments
- Spun up 11 new acq channels, incl long-term organic bets
- Improved ad conv to landing page by 54%
- Clear path towards margin improvement when needed
- Community relaunch/engagement went well
- Hundreds of user tests/feedback sessions per month
- Clear path to near-max leveling of session 5 retention

Team is deeply engaged; culture, pace, and quality are strong

**What are our challenges?**

We still have TOFU conversion challenge and revenue has flattened (only +20% growth from Q423 to Q124) as we established new acquisition channels in this “phase change"
- CAC is still too high across channels but improving
- Landing page conversion still being solved; missteps with a few agencies led to slow progress
- Product marketing is a challenge as people don't understand what we are providing, the branding is too niche, etc

We are losing too many members between signup and first session due to slow matching process

Discord is confusing to new members and leads to drop off; need to move off of discord and into our own app experience

Need to focus on the highest growth/learning, aggressive new bets while still keeping the momentum on high-priority inflight initiatives

Cash burn was higher than expected due to agency costs, recruiters

Q1 Initiatives + Learnings // Growth Marketing
Website relaunch coming mid-Apr after extensive
usertesting iterations on product marketing/brand

Conversion rate on the website is currently the biggest blocker to efficient growth. The reskin in November did not increase CVR and was a significant hit on our brand/product marketing as we did the PR push. The new design that is launching later this week has tested very well and is poised to be the conversion unlock we've needed to fuel growth. Lots of learnings for product marketing and our process with 2 brand agencies.

Q1 Initiatives + Learnings // Growth Marketing
We've focused on diversifying new acq channels,
drove 54% conversion improvement from ads to LP

CPMs on Meta have remained as high as we saw during the holidays, but the injection of diversified ad creative has helped us increase conversion rates from 0.68% -> 1.05% (ads to LP)

**What worked:**
- Setup 11 new acq channels
- Diversified ad creative
- Google branded/unbranded
- Youtube ads launch
- LLM chatbot on website
- Wellness influencer content
- UGC content platform
- Podcasts/JG network cred
- Rapid user conversion testing

**What didn't work:**
- Website reskin 1 too niche
- PR push, while positive, led to very little conversion
- Community partnerships via CMs in discord and reddit were combative
- Twitch esports/gamer influencer holiday streams
- Tiktok ads not efficient
- Game partnership with Kinder World good for them, not us
- Branding agencies

**Promising but still in-flight:**
- Blog/SEO improvement
- Performance PR
- Affiliate/referrals program
- Inbound B2B interest from: Steelseries, Amazon Games, Accenture

**Chart: Session Drivers**
*Stacked area chart showing the percentage of sessions driven by various channels over time.*
Channels: Other, Organic, TikTok, Google Branded, Google Non-brand, Meta.
Dates: May 2023 to Feb 2024.
Trend: Meta, Google Non-brand, and Google Branded are significant drivers. Organic shows some presence. TikTok and Other are smaller contributions. The overall trend indicates diversification of session sources.
*(Note: Exact numerical percentages for each channel per month are not provided on the chart itself, only visually represented as stacked areas.)*

**Chart: Subscription Drivers**
*Stacked area chart showing the percentage of subscriptions driven by various channels over time.*
Channels: Other, Organic, TikTok, Google Branded, Google Non-brand, Meta.
Dates: May 2023 to Feb 2024.
Trend: Similar to session drivers, Meta and Google (Non-brand and Branded) are major contributors. Organic also plays a role.

Q1 Initiatives + Learnings // Activation
Pilot improved Session 5 retention by +60%; working
to fix 37% drop-off from signup to first session

**Enhanced Activation Flow:** We have a 37% drop-off after signup due to 1) matching wait times and 2) confusing experience getting setup in discord
- **Launched improvements**
  - Automatically match 30% of users to a group during onboarding
  - Updated UI to streamline the signup process
  - Re-booted Discord community (~50,000 messages/month)
  - Added SMS, calendar, and notifications
- **Up Next**
  - Expand automatching to all users on our landing page signup
  - Move program off of discord and into our own app

**New Journeyer Wayfinding:** “camp-counselor” staff navigator for new journeyers during their first 5 sessions, stellar retention improvement.

**Results:** We've improved Session 5 retention from 66% (all-time avg) to 85.7% (last 100 journeyers) → note this is very tentative sample size; wayfinding groups have retention of 92% at session 5 (60% higher than control groups)

**Up Next:** Scale up wayfinding and game guides, expand to new games

Q1 Initiatives + Learnings // LTV Expansion
We can increase ARPU for our highly-engaged
users by offering more services

10% of all current active Jyrs “pre-ordered” an additional service, so we launched pilots of three additional service offerings:

**Dungeons & Dragons Campaign performed the best:**
narrative-based, 10-week campaign, paid in two installments of $200
- Initial openings sold out in few hours
- 70% of subscribers paid the second installment ($400 total)
- Represents 52% increase in ARPU for this user subset

**HJC for Couples:** similar to our core HJC program, but just with 1 couple; $120/session, paid two sessions at a time
- Limited signups, hard to convince partners to get help
- LTV increase for just couples testers was $480

**Hero Skills Campaigns v2:** larger cohort-based courses in a lecture-style, story-based RPG model with a JG (not launched yet)

**Next up:** Expansion into teens/adolescents market (launch test on hold due to PR risk)

Q2 Goals // MVP Native App
Discord is a confusing, noisy
experience for new journeyers and
leads to significant drop-off

We're going to redesign the session
experience and build our own native
mobile app to host our sessions

Note: there are early work-in-progress wireframes in appendix

**MVP “spike” of native app:** We will need to ramp up production for the app from scratch, which means the next quarter will be focused only on spinning up a workable version to host sessions for new members

**“Casual gamers” struggle to keep up:** The initial niche of users in our program who are Discord super-users are no longer the primary demographic in our program

**Discord communities/Guilds:** Will remain in discord and be linkable from the app but will be separate experiences for the journeyers

**Security risks:** There are too many security holes in discord that outweigh the benefits for us operating in that space, for example we need to control all JG engagement outside of sessions and ensure access safety for minors

## Slide 27: Q2 Goals // Expand into teens and adolescents
Confidential and Privileged

Q2 Goals // Expand into teens and adolescents
Teens represent a large,
strategic opportunity for
expansion at the intersection
of digital wellness, gaming,
and loneliness/mental health.

**Criteria for expansion considerations:**
- Defensible market dominance for a small but highly-invested set of early adopters
- Network effects, WoM loops, and distribution moats
- Path to exponentializable growth and room to scale
- Leverages our core competencies to maximize learning, growth, or distribution moats
- Maximizes LTV/distro advantages native to gaming, digital mental health, or social connection

**Higher incidence of mental illness:** There are significantly higher rates of diagnosed mental illness and loneliness in minors, with parents willing to invest in their treatment. Current crisis is 4x worse than adults (suicidality, SUD, ER)

**Clearer positioning and value:** Much clearer product marketing opportunity and customer-perceived PMF from testing, people naturally assume this is for kids/teens. It's also more clear why gaming is a more effective medium for delivering care for kids.

**Unsafe gaming; high pain-point with unmet need:** As kids spend more of their time in gaming worlds, parents are struggling to curtail what they are exposed to; there is still a stigma around gaming being toxic, unsafe, and risky for kids. There currently aren't great alternatives/solutions.

**Come for the therapist, stay for the connections:** Adults are unwilling to pay for friendships/connections so the current sell is "affordable group support" which gets them in the door. But parents ARE willing to pay for both mental health support and social connection for their kids, so the value is much clearer upfront. This also allows us to create a 2-tier pricing subscription model.

**Need for subclinical options:** There is also high variability and ambiguity in care needs, with dearth of subclinical options; what kids label as mental illness or disease is actually: loneliness, need for connection, call for attention, misuse of terminologies, dopamine addiction, neurodivergence, overwhelm, etc.

**More time spent gaming:** As kids spend more of their time in gaming worlds, we are able to displace more mental healthcare spend for this demographic as they "age up" into our system. We're betting on gaming being the new social.

**Partnership interest:** early convos with Hazel Health and Roblox Edu

Q2 Goals // Expand into teens and adolescents
Original goal was to launch a beta expansion immediately with current
program but that has been put on hold due to PR risk

**Plan A**
The first test we were planning to run, to validate the need for mental health support inside of games for teens/adolescents with our current program:
- Launch current HJC program for teens (13-17) in Discord, with updated branding and product positioning
- Run ads for parents and test landing page conversion (for CAC comparison)

Public Relations Risk Mitigation

**What Happened?**
- We recently learned that one of our Journey Guides was arrested. The charges do not involve any of their work with Hero Journey Club, however as soon as we learned of this matter we took immediate action.
- Unfortunately, this type of situation is not unheard of in the industry. Background check processes do not include arrests prior to conviction; we're implementing annual checks.
- One member of their groups posted about their discontent and the nature of the arrest on TrustPilot

**How Did We Respond?**
- **Immediate actions:**
  - Terminated the JG immediately
  - Audited their company communications 4x (no evidence of wrongdoing on HJC platform)
  - Reassigned all journeyers to alternate Journey Guides
- **Strategic planning:**
  - Consulted with legal (both employment and healthcare counsel) on approach
  - Engaged with a top-tier crisis communications firm (Risa Heller) to manage any escalations
- **Resolution:**
  - Confirmation that we've done as much as we can to ensure the safety of our members and validated that there is no sign of foul-play involving our service or platform
  - Communicated with 8/9 of the parents of minors; parents were initially receptive to our explanation but we will monitor
  - Established active social channel monitoring for further public posts/communications if this expands
  - Have clear action items for improving our process: annual background checks, moving off of discord

Joseph Campbell Foundation Licensing

**Context:**
- We've applied for the trademark “Hero Journey Club" in United States, Canada, United Kingdom, New Zealand, Australia, and European Union in anticipation of future scale up
- The Joseph Campbell Foundation (owners of trademark "Hero's Journey") reached out with a cease-and-desist letter upon seeing our trademark application to the US patent office
- The correspondence with JCF has been very amicable and they clearly want a financial resolution for their nonprofit

**Resolution:**
- We've negotiated and come to an agreement to license the name "Hero Journey” from the JCF in exchange for a $15,000 USD one-time licensing fee for unrestricted use of the trademark for mental health services (and the range of coverage we listed in the US PTO application), with no term date/limits or location restrictions
- In exchange, they will not oppose our trademark for Hero Journey Club and agree to amicably coexist within our respective areas

**Next Steps:**
- Currently in licensing agreement legal review and we expect to finalize this in Q2

Teen/Adolescent
Market Expansion Tests

Confidential and Privileged

Q2 Goals // Expand into teens and adolescents

**Plan A**
The first test we were planning to run, to
validate the need for mental health support
inside of games for teens/adolescents:
- Launch current HJC program for teens
  (13-17) in Discord, with updated branding
  and product positioning
- Run ads for parents and test landing page
  conversion (for CAC comparison)
- 70% of our JGs have the credentials to
  work with teens already
- Hero Skills Campaigns already developed

- For adolescents, we would white-label
  community course platform like Mighty or
  Circle to pilot program with parents/kids

This has been postponed due to the recent PR
risk, so that we didn't risk adding more fuel to
the fire by drawing more attention

**Plan B**
In the meantime, we focused on validating the market expansion
opportunity into digital wellbeing for teens/adolescents

We ran 150+ user test sessions in 2 weeks to understand:
- What do parents (who worry about their child's mental health /
  gaming) value and worry about?
  - Safe gaming
  - Social growth
  - Life skills while gaming
  - Mental health
- What scares parents?
- Where is their thorniest pain point?
- How much will they pay?
- Who is initial target wedge?
- Differences by child age?
- How do they position alternatives?

**Next:** Iterate until we get to a clear testable option for pricing,
features, etc and then spin up landing page to run waitlist signup
conversion tests on non-HJC brand page

## Slide 62: Addressing Parental Concerns about Gaming
Confidential and Privileged

Kids want to game more but parents are worried that it's bad for their mental health,
impacts their relationships, interfere with schoolwork, and puts them at risk of being
exposed to inappropriate content, predators, or video game addiction.

In the “real world,” parents are also worried about their kids' loneliness/isolation, bullying,
low self-esteem, procrastination, etc. We want to enable the kids to continue gaming, in a
safe environment that also fosters growth/empowerment in social connection, support,
and mental health. In exchange, kids get to game more while also earning rewards in the
games they already love.

Gaming time into Growing time. Expand from mental health into digital well-being.
Healing through connection and belonging.
