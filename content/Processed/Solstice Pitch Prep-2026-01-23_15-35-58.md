### Core Business Model & Market Opportunity

- Solstice: AI agency for life sciences content creation
- Pharma companies spend $1B+ getting drugs through clinical trials, then struggle to commercialize effectively
- Content creation bottleneck: simple email takes 2 months, costs $50k due to FDA regulatory requirements
- Traditional workflow requires multiple PharmD/PhD specialists at agencies like Real Chemistry ($1B+ revenue)
- Content increasingly critical as markets shift from single therapeutics to multiple competitors requiring differentiation

### Product & Technology Differentiation

- Platform lets pharma marketers create compliant content in minutes vs months
- User describes content needs in natural language → system generates FDA-compliant emails, banners, social posts
- Key advantage: codifies tribal knowledge of biopharma marketing into technology
- Built specifically for biopharma vs generic AI marketing tools
	- Understands clinical context and FDA regulations
	- Taps into pharma-specific knowledge requirements
- Data moat builds through customer interactions and defining excellence standards for non-verifiable content tasks

### Traction & Customer Base

- $1.6M ARR after 6 months commercialization
- Targeting $3.2M ARR within 30-60 days
- Working with 3 top 10 pharma companies (including Sanofi, AstraZeneca)
- Akebia Therapeutics moving forward with $276k contract
- High NPS scores driving internal virality at pharma companies

### Go-to-Market Strategy

- Bottom-up approach targeting individual brand marketers (direct pain point owners)
- Each pharma brand operates as independent $10M+ business unit
- Quick ROI demonstration on first demo call vs month-long agency wait times
- MSA acquisition enables rapid internal scaling (competing only with other MSA holders)
- Path to enterprise deals: AstraZeneca’s 80+ brands could represent $500M+ ACV opportunity

### Pitch Refinement Feedback

- Structure improvement needed:
- Key messages to emphasize:
	- Why content matters: “Educate the industry” - differentiation requirement in competitive markets
	- Speed advantage: pharma marketers can’t A/B test due to 3-month compliance cycles
	- Better performance through proprietary claims generation and data utilization
- Remove mechanical delivery, add natural conversation flow with prepared talking points

### Action Items

- Aris: Write script with 1-2 sentence bullets for key talking points (not full paragraphs)
- Practice pitch extensively over weekend before 15+ investor meetings Monday/Tuesday
- Refine blurb language: consider “biopharma commercialization platform” vs “AI agency”
- Address Veeva competitive positioning: explain why incumbents haven’t entered this space historically
