Weaving healthcare’s future

Digital health acquisitions are dominating recent headlines and setting the tone for 2025. Commure rang in the new year with an enhanced suite of clinical and operational offerings for providers after acquiring care navigation platform Memora Health in late December. Shortly after, Transcarent announced a $621M purchase of Accolade (a discount from its initial public valuation of $1.2B), merging patient navigation tools and growing its employer plan customer base. Last week, Health Catalyst acquired Upfront Healthcare, integrating its automated patient acquisition and retention solutions into an existing suite of management tools for healthcare organizations. These tapestry weaving moves highlight a growing trend where cash-rich players integrate assets—often valued below their peak—to broaden capabilities in a competitive landscape. As Goliaths in healthcare continue to flex, this new era of tapestry weaving reflects the creativity of the sector.
