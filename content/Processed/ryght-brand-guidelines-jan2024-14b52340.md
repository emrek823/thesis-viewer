Branding Guidelines
JANUARY 2024

## Slide 2: Welcome
Welcome

Brand is more than a logo or a tagline. It is a perception held in the mind
of the audience and is a culmination of their experiences, both good and
bad, across the many touch points of a brand. A consistent and cohesive
expression is one of the most important assets a brand can own and
requires diligence in maintaining.

These guidelines were developed to that end, and are for use across all
materials developed for the Ryght Brand. Whether digital or print, these
provide the necessary elements and direction to address any project.
Where appropriate, you will find specifications and details, as well as helpful
guidance to assist in decision-making. We hope you find these guidelines
helpful in designing your communications.

## Slide 6: Primary Logo
Primary Logo

The Ryght logo is a bold, assertive and confident
mark. The play on "right" is intentional and is
further emphasized through the rebellious
treatment of the "Y". In execution, the Y drops
the one ascender to form an abstracted arrow
forwards. The period at the end is a further design
treatment that punctuates the idea of correctness.
The typography chosen for use in the logo is a
customized use of a Gothic typeface and utilizes
strong letterforms, all in caps.

In cases where the logo is not used as a graphic,
such as written communications, the correct usage
is "Ryght", without the period at the end.

RIGHT.

## Slide 7: Misuse
Misuse

It is important to reflect the brand consistently.
These are just some examples of misuse that
would negatively impact our brand. If there is any
question about a stylistic treatment it is best to
inquire before implementing.

RIGHT.
DO NOT
change color of any part of the logo
mark or use colors not provided in
the digital asset library.

RIGHT.RIGHT.
DO NOT
skew or stretch the logo. Always retain 100%
ratio when scaling up or down.

RIGHT.
DO NOT
angle the logo within a communication.
It should always be fully horizontal
(preferred) or at a full 90 degree angle.

RIGHT.
DO NOT
use outlines on the logo or
letterforms.

RIGHT.
DO NOT
use pattern fills or gradients in the
logo or letterforms.

RIGHT.
DO NOT
contain logo in a shape.

## Slide 8: On Black
On Black

The Ryght logo is also available for use
against dark backgrounds. While an all-
white logo is acceptable in select instances,
such as single color palettes, it is always
preferable to have the "Y" in our brand red.

## Slide 9: Safe Zone
Safe Zone

Maintain the brand logo's integrity by
providing adequate surrounding space,
known as the 'safe' area. This ensures
protection from interference with other
graphical elements like type, imagery, or
additional marks.

RIGHT.

SAFE AREA - Full Logo
Determine the safe area by
considering one-third of the
letterforms' height. Use the above
as reference when designing
communications.

SAFE AREA - Y Letterform
Identify the safe area by using
either one-fourth of the height or
the full width of the bottom leg of
the letterform. Refer to above when
designing communications.

## Slide 11: Typography
Typography

Primary Typeface

Poppins is the primary typeface for Ryght. It
was chosen for its well-balanced attributes,
legibility and complimentary nature to the
Ryght brand mark.

It should be used for all headlines, body
copy and other typography needs. Hierarchy
is achieved through the use of different
weights. Approved weights are "Light",
"Regular", and "Semi-Bold".

Poppins Light

## Slide 12: Typography Hierarchy
Typography

Hierarchy

Visual hierarchy helps readers better
understand messaging by clearly delineating
between headline, sub-heads and body copy.

Semi-bold, regular and light weights help
establish hierarchy.

The body copy should be legible and high
contrast against background. Use black or
dark gray against white or light backgrounds,
and white against dark backgrounds.

Use the example to the right as a guideline. In
the future, templates will exist for commonly
used documents such as press releases,
marketing 1-pagers and presentations.

Ryght
Color Palette

The Ryght color palette was chosen for its
bold, high-contrast hues, providing a rich and
distinctive tool set for use in communications
and materials. Based on a primary palette
of dark and light, use the blue and purple
accents intentionally. The primary, darkest blue
is primarily used as a solid fill or background.
To draw attention to elements such as call-
to-actions (CTA's) and important messaging,
use the other two purples accordingly. Detailed
usage is available via specifications for both
website and product GUI.

## Slide 16: Gradients
Gradients

These are the initial gradients that have been
developed for the Ryght brand and they are
used primarily for shape fills such as in charts,
diagrams and display text.

Gradients are linear with 2 colors. Angles,
opacity and location steps can vary depending
on the artwork or graphic needed.

It is important to note that while specifications
are provided here, gradients can be tricky to
implement and it is best to use existing assets
whenever possible.

| Gradient | Start HEX | End HEX |
| :------- | :-------- | :------ |
| Blue 1   | #90C7F4   | #0060C5 |

## Slide 18: Photography
Photography

Photography should be carefully chosen and in
alignment with our communication goals. As our
strategies progress, our image library should expand
to encompass "captured moments" of individuals
in the life sciences industry. The take-away should
emphasize empowerment, efficiency, and positive
engagement, while ensuring inclusivity in terms of
race and gender.

Stylistically, we are using black and white
photography. Brightness and contrast levels may
need to be retouched for cohesiveness with the
images already in place.

## Slide 23: Post Templates
Post Templates

A series of layouts have been developed for use
on social. In each of these layouts the "Y" plays a
prominent role in branding the communication as
well as providing a clear focus for messaging.

Topics include generic posting, partnership
announcements, industry quotes, and value drivers
of the product. As needs arise, additional templates
will be developed for use by the team. These are
built in both Adobe XD and Adobe Illustrator.
