# Translucent - Series A Reinvest

## Executive Summary

*   Lessons Learned / Requirements for SPVs
*   Market Timing / Why now
*   Seed to Series A Evolution
*   Financing / Exit

### Executive Summary

Since the seed in March 2025, Translucent has accelerated its product vision to become the system of record & action for healthcare finance and expanded upstream to health systems from their original focus on medical groups. These were both ambitious stretch goals we were expecting to reach in late 2026.

Translucent is already embedded in core workflows across multi-billion dollar providers and we are even more bullish on the opportunity for Translucent today for 4 main reasons.

*   **Accelerated sales velocity.** Translucent initially targeted medical groups for shorter sales cycles, but enterprise health systems are not only moving faster than anticipated (3-4 months vs. typical 12–18) but bringing 2-3x larger contract values.
*   **Product utilization and dependence.** Customers like Duly and Springfield are expanding use cases and hitting major milestones faster than projected, including new departments, datasets, and daily usage across operators.
*   **Top-down CFO pull driving pipeline growth.** With 100% founder-led GTM to date, Translucent has built $15M+ in qualified pipeline at $1B Health systems. Translucent has $625K in live ARR and is on track to triple ARR to $1.8M by end of 2025 and is targeting $12M in ARR by the end of 2026.
*   **Strength of team, especially on product/eng.** Translucent has assembled a team with both the deep healthcare and product/eng experience (Pengyu; CTO, Anca; Head of Product, etc), required to scale in vertical AI today. This talent concentration signals where the best engineers are gravitating in healthcare AI, and positions Translucent to scale execution rapidly with the Series A.

As with SmarterDx, the path to $100M ARR selling into health systems is straightforward (although non-trivial): how do we sell to 30-50 health systems with $2-2.5M ACVs? We can see that vision playing out with Translucent today and now is the time to capture that opportunity as Translucent has the potential to become a category leader in a $25B market.

We are excited to invest $XM in $YM round at $ZM post-money valuation...

## Lessons Learned / Requirements for SPVS

We have done 6 SPVs to-date across fund I. We've had some opportunities like SmarterDx's Series A where didn't double down aggressively enough and other instances where we should not have reinvested. We have learned what constitutes an attractive re-investment opportunity, namely:

**Enhanced Market Opportunity.** We want to see specific data points from market and customers for how/why the market opportunity is more attractive at the time of original investment, and be quantitative/critical around whether another "Act" is required to build a large business (10x+ potential from current valuation), and what the 50x potential could be. For Translucent, we are confident in all 3 aspects.

*   **How/why market opportunity more attractive.** We under appreciated the margin pressures and tailwinds that healthcare providers are facing and heard this directly from Translucent's current customers and pipeline. OBBB (announced in July), for example, adds another 1-3% in EBITDA margin pressures for providers.
*   **10x with current Act 1.** We understand what $2m+ ACV deals look like for health systems, see the current pipeline and how that grows to 50+ systems, and there are no major competitors in market today beyond consulting firms (Strata, Chartis, etc).
*   **50x Potential.** Because Translucent is embedded within these core finance systems as an agent that drives work/output (vs. a nice-to-have software tool), we are more bullish on the world where Translucent can drive 2-3% margin improvement (not just 1-2%) on the $2.5T in healthcare spend for providers in the US today.

**Inflection Point for Business.** This is a function of time (how many months/years ahead of schedule relative to original seed plan) x traction (specific traction evidence to support pre-empt financing).

*   **Time.** Translucent is at least 12 months ahead of schedule. At the time of the original seed, us and management identified signing 1 health system as a stretch goal.
*   **Traction.** We were projecting $2m in CARR prior to Series A next year and Translucent will hit that this year with $3M+ cash on hand.

**Inside Information.** Do we have unique insider information that should increase our bullishness compared to the rest of the market? In speaking with customers and potential customers in market, we have heard time and time again that Translucent is identified as the leading startup in the healthcare FP&A space. We've also seen firsthand their ability to attract top-tier product and engineering talent, which provides clear validation of both the company's vision and the technical ambition of its platform. We view early talent movements as leading indicators because those closest to emerging AI and infrastructure shifts have the broadest set of opportunities, yet are choosing to build with Jack and Max and tackle this opportunity at Translucent. The additions of Pengyu Li (CTO), Anca (Head of Product), Michael Ricciuti (Head of Delivery) and others reflects this pull. Similar to how SmarterDx drew early talent from Dr. Nigam Shah's Stanford lab pre-Series A and was able to hire Wayne Grodsky as CCO, we place meaningful weight on where technical builders and commercial leaders are gravitating towards.

**Investor Interest: Quality & Aggressiveness.** We have learned to listen carefully to the Series A/B market investors when they seek to invest in our portfolio companies. And, instances where this is outsized, organic, pre-emptive interest from Tier 1 (NEA pre-empted, GV moving aggressively and making intros, Insight Partners moving quickly, 8VC, Bessemer, etc).

We want to see all of these and list investor interest last purposefully. There have been circumstances, for example, where reinvestment may be led by certain reputable firms but where there actually wasn't strong evidence of PMF or reasoning to double-down at that time (e.g. HJC).

## Market Timing / Why now

Many of the same market trends from 5-6 months ago that we talked about at the seed are still relevant, but what has changed is our recognition of of how these pressures reenforce one another to drive financial strain for providers. Margin compression, reimbursement headwinds, and regulatory change are colliding at once and the impact is worse than the sum of its parts.

### Why Now? Unprecedented Financial Pressure on Healthcare

The chart "Why Now? Unprecedented Financial Pressure on Healthcare" illustrates various pressures:

*   **Labor Costs**
*   **Reimbursement**
*   **Interest Rates**
*   **Tariffs**
*   **Big Beautiful Bill**

**Caption:** Finance teams are being asked to do more than ever — with fewer resources and tighter timelines.

Hospitals are facing increasing profitability pressures and regulatory changes, forcing CFOs to adapt. AI provides an opportunity to empower non-super users – the healthcare operators on the ground – to access financial analysis for all departments and service lines 24/7.

*   **Profitability Pressures.** Healthcare providers have always had low operating margins (2-5%), but efforts to improve margins are becoming increasingly challenging. Provider organizations now have to juggle many issues, including persistent economic and inflation pressures, workforce struggles, evolving utilization trends, increasing competition, and supply chain problems. Health system operating margins largely recovered following sizable volatility in recent years, but expenses continue to rise across the board (11%+ over last 2 years). At the same time, hospitals' expenses have been met with inadequate increases in reimbursement by government payers and increasing administrative burden due to inappropriate commercial health insurer practices.
*   **Regulatory Tailwinds: The OBBB.** Signed on July 4 2025, the One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB) reshapes the economics of U.S. hospitals and amplifies demand for real-time financial intelligence. $793B Medicaid cuts and $268B in ACA marketplace cuts over the next 10 years could lead to 11M more uninsured and 1-3% EBITDA headwinds. Increased price transparency, a push to site-neutral payments, and ongoing scrutiny of the 340B program, amongst other reasons, have potential to compress hospital operating margins even more so.
*   **CFO Mentality Shifting.** CFO mentality is shifting from blanket cost-cuts to more precise profitability. Traditionally, health care finance leaders have relied on cost reduction as the primary strategy to boost profitability. Labor constitutes 50-60% of expenses for healthcare providers, so there is only so much value to squeeze from blunt expense cuts. Deloitte's 2025 U.S. Health-Care CFO Survey shows 73 % of finance leaders rank revenue growth and operating-margin expansion as their top worry, while traditional cost-reduction has fallen out of the top three priorities for the first time since 2020.
*   **Advancements in LLMs for FPA and Structured Data.** Advancements in LLMs over the last 12 months, particularly with structured data (text-to-SQL, coding Python scripts, RAG, and agentic frameworks, etc), have made it possible to build AI FPA solutions with the accuracy and performance required for real-world use. As an example, Text-to-SQL answers correctly 98% of the time on open-source benchmarks today, a massive improvement from ~75% in 2023. In the real-world working with enterprise data, prompting the best LLMs and using agent-based methods hit a ceiling at 85% accuracy. Fine-tuning open-weight LLMs on business-specific query-SQL pairs gave 95% accuracy, reduced response times to under 7 seconds (by eliminating failure recovery), and simplified engineering. These examples and techniques have already been tested in other industries, which give Translucent a playbook and framework in healthcare. At the same time, this data shows how healthcare-specific expertise (e.g., understanding data schemas, the questions people will ask, and ideal outputs) improves performance of these systems.

## Seed to Series A Evolution

We've seen the product in action driving utilization and real productivity gains that enables Translucent to build a semantic layer that drives durable, long-term differentiation. The 2026 ($10M+ ARR) and 2027 ($50M+ ARR) commercial plan is also becoming clearer. The core team is in place to scale over the next 2 years and beyond

### Product

#### We're building the AI Finance Analyst for Healthcare

The diagram "We're building the AI Finance Analyst for Healthcare" illustrates the AI FP&A Analyst's role and connections:

*   **Central Component:** AI FP&A Analyst
*   **Connected Teams (Left):**
    *   Finance Teams
    *   Ops Teams
    *   Physicians
*   **Output Capabilities (Right):**
    *   Ask Questions in Natural Language
    *   Forecasting & Trend Analysis
    *   Real-Time Reports & Tables
    *   Provider Ramp, Benchmarking, Summarization
*   **Specific Analyses (Bottom):**
    *   Physician Productivity
    *   Physician Compensation
    *   In-Month Rev Performance
    *   EoM Budget Variance

Over 70% of engaged users run 5-20 queries per session and sessions with 5+ queries average 20 minutes. Users depend on Translucent for high-value workflows. Users also can onboard quickly, even via self-service. Users can run multi-step analyses on RVUs, encounters, and charges, and export multiple tables to excel on their first day using the platform. Translucent is also demonstrating concrete productivity gains and error reduction to validate strong customer feedback from early users. In one example (more quantifiable ROI in table below), Translucent uncovered 20% error rates in provider schedule utilization data within manually maintained finance team spreadhseets by directly integrating Translucent's AI agents with the customers data warehouse.

| Workflow                                     | Manual Effort | With Translucent | Time Saved Per Cycle |
| :------------------------------------------- | :------------ | :--------------- | :------------------- |
| Audit month-end close expenses               | 5-8 hrs       | ~5 to 10 minutes | 7 HOURS              |
| Review vendor expenses                       | 3-5 hrs       | ~5 to 10 minutes | 4 HOURS              |
| Forecast Revenue and Expenses                | 3-5 hrs       | ~5 to 10 minutes | 4 HOURS              |
| Analyze / review profitability (location, dept., etc.) | 5-8 hrs       | ~5 to 10 minutes | 6 HOURS              |
| Prepare Internal service line performance meetings | 10-15 hrs     | ~20 to 30 minutes | 12 HOURS             |

Translucent's semantic layer and performance dataset is IP that compounds with scale. They are building a healthcare-specific infrastructure that unifies financial data into a domain-specific semantic layer that is embedded directly into workflows like P&Ls, budgeting, and forecasting. We had this original hypotheses at the seed but now we see it in the live platform with data from real customers running through it. Translucent's positioning makes them a system of action for provider finance, something that horizontal FP&A tools cannot replicate. Every deployment builds a unique dataset of financial and operational performance.

**Commercial.** In 11 months since founding (6 months since seed) with a 7 person team and only founder-led sales, Translucent has built a $15M pipeline and compressed sales cycles for health systems from the traditional 18 months down to just 3 months. Current CARR is $1.5M (UTSW, Northwestern in contracting) with clear expansion paths to $2M+ ACVs. The focus for 2026 is building the GTM engine to sign $350K ACVs for 30 providers ($10.5M in net-new ARR) and lay the foundation for land-and-expand and continued growth into 2027.

### Path to $65M ARR: Logos → Expansion → Category Leadership

#### 2026: The Year of Land + Expand

*   Built $15M pipeline in 11 months with founder-led sales (3-month cycles vs. 18-month legacy) → clear PMF
*   Focus: Land logos + expand product (FP&A Analyst, semantic layer, core financial workflows)
*   Target: $12M ARR (30 new logos @ $350K ACV + $1.5m existing customer expansion)
*   Burn: ~$14.4M | Team: ~47 FTEs
*   Strategic IP: Each logo compounds dataset → benchmarking, predictive insights, switching costs

#### 2027: The Year of Growth + Expansion

*   Focus: Expand & upsell → 30 landed logos grow from $350K → $1M+ ACV
*   Land 50 new logos with higher starting ACVs ($500K-$1M+)
*   Target: $65M ARR – $30M expansion from initial 30 customers – $35M from 50 new logos (mix of $500K and $1M ACVs)

### Team

Jack has continued to impress with his commercial leadership and presence with CFOs / VPs of Finance who view him as industry expert and peer. We've seen Jack exhibit the full-spectrum of qualities we'd want to see in an AI-native CEO, from commercial intensity/sophistication, to clarity of vision, to the composure / quick thinking to scale a complex business. Max, initially a strong complement to Jack, has evolved into a true co-founder. His growth over the past five months has been impressive, taking ownership across operations and execution in ways that meaningfully raise our conviction in the founding team.

**TEAM**

*   **Jack O'Hara**
    *   CEO & Co-founder
    *   Former C-Suite at ChenMed, Springfield & Mount Sinai Health System
*   **Max Jones**
    *   Co-founder & COO
    *   Former healthcare investor (Redesign) & Deloitte consultant
*   **Pengyu Li**
    *   CTO
    *   Former Commanding Officer Palantir for Asia Market, Scaled Tiktok Eng Team and former Airtable & Airbnb
*   **Anca Marinescu**
    *   Head of Product
    *   Flatiron Health AI product leader
    *   Scaled $0 -> $60M ARR AI/ML platform

On the technical side, the addition of Pengyu was a major win. His reputation, which is validated by interest from investors like 8VC who knew him from Palantir, is a strong signal. His involvement reduces future technical and hiring risk. Anca has been equally strong, leading product and customer integrations while building the semantic layer that underpins long-term durability, leveraging her healthcare experience from Flatiron to bridge product and domain.

## Financing / Exit

We index on opportunities like Translucent that are not just building a faster horse with AI, but fundamentally creating new categories. In our conversations with customers and other investors in market, it has become apparent that Translucent has cemented its place as the first AI Finance OS for healthcare and now is the time to scale aggressively.

**SmarterDx Comp.** Below is SmarterDx at their $50M Series B at a $350M post-money valuation. After this Series B, they scaled to $100M+ in CARR at the time of their $1.1B acquisition by New Mountain.

Beyond also serving health systems and the revenue ramp (where Translucent is early), there are key comparisons and lessons we have learned that give us confidence in Translucent.

*   **Single Product (SDX Pre-bill) vs. Platform (Translucent).** SDX never scaled beyond its first single threaded product in pre-bill, while Translucent is selling multiple agents (physician productivity, benchmarking) across multiple services lines (cardiology, ortho, labs, etc). As an example, Translucent is in discussions to work with 80 service lines at UTSW.
*   **Rip and replace potential.** SmarterDx purposefully required no EMR integration and sat on top of other competitive solutions in CDI like 3M or Iodine. Translucent with its semantic layer is embedded with core business process and can ultimately become the source of truth. It is easy to swap CDI if there is another tool with better performance, but it's much more difficult to swap out a system of record if that system of record is closing your monthly books like Translucent is.

**2026.** The focus for 2026 is landing logos at scale and expanding core product capabilities

*   **GTM / Delivery.** Scale from founder-led sales and target top-tier logos ($1B+ health systems) while delivering exceptional results for customers with forward deployed model.
*   **Engineering Scale.** Expand team to build additional "financial work capabilities" that set the foundation for upsell and for owning the system of record layer over time.

By the end of 2026, Translucent is planning to have a team of 30-40 (the current model is aggressive on hiring; 50% engineering, 25% delivery, 25% sales). The company is projecting $350K ACVs for top 30 providers to generate $10.5M in net-new ARR and reach ~$12M in ARR by the EOY 2026. We believe Translucent can hit this aggressive goal, but see an equally likely base case where these goals are stretched out over 18 months and the company reaches $8M ARR by EOY 2026 (still top-decile growth). We also see the potential for higher ACVs with the "land" motion given early feedback from Duly, Springfield and health system customers.

**2027.** With logos landed in 2026, 2027 is about expansion, larger ACVs and category leadership in FP&A. Growing from $350K ACV to $1M+ ACV with 30 customers can drive another $19.5M in ARR. While these goals are ambitious, we've seen early signals of this expansion with early discussions with Northwestern (plans to expand to 183 service lines = $1.8M in CARR) and UT Southwestern (plans to expand to 80 service lines = $1.6M in CARR).

| Contracted Rev per Sales Employee (inc. Founders) | $571,875        | $1,381,944       |

These are the type of revenue growth profiles and gross margins that put Translucent into the tier of high-growth, healthcare AI startups (like Assort Health) that have garnered investor interest over the last 18 months. Assort, for example, raised its Series B from LightSpeed at a $750M post-money with $2-$3M in CARR with projections to get to $8-$10M by end of year. Translucent has 90+% gross margins today because inference is cheap today with the structured data they are mostly dealing with. Even with more unstructured data at scale, they will still have very attractive gross margins (85+%), unlike some other rapidly growing AI companies that have been maligned for sacraficing margins for growth (e.g., Cursor).

**Exits / Comps.** We are also starting to see that Translucent is defining its own category and tapping further into $60B in spend a year on consultants, software, and most importantly labor in the FP&A space. We use RCM comps as a baseline to be conservative, but think there is a higher premium and potential given this category defining nature and how Translucent (and the finance teams) sit a layer up and encompass more spend and impact than RCM alone.
