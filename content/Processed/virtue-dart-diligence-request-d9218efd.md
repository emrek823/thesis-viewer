Previous investor updates / other materials. You’ve mentioned investor updates you’ve sent out. This is great info and already made. Can you forward these? Anything else along these lines (customer-facing materials, anything internal on product, etc) that’s easy to share? We’ll take anything and everything you have handy.

Business

Current pipeline/customers. Let’s break down all current customers and any in the pipeline. We were essentially trying to build a google sheet like this. Let us know if easier to input directly here or if you can just pull anything from CRM or excel you have handy (doesn’t need to be pretty).

Fundraising. Previous fundraising terms/amount.

Cash balance / burn. What is the current cash balance and monthly net burn?

Team. Current team members and roles/responsibilities.

Product.

Current Use Cases. We’re trying to take the 100+ clinical use cases from the site and get a better understanding of everything you’ve built to-date, both the internal architecture and specific clinical AI models. Can you help us paint this picture to get really specific about current product capabilities?

Custom Use Cases. When a customer asks for a custom use case, what is the process/timeline to spin that up?

Dart X. What exactly are you offering with Dart X and what is built to-date? Is this something you have already sold or just started selling? Any other nuances that would be helpful to share (e.g., working with pharmacists as annotators/labelers) that show the power of Dart X for customers?

Roadmap. What is the product roadmap over the next 12-24 months?

References. Can you each provide 2-3 references we can speak with?

Origin story. What has been the journey since founding in 2022 (original idea → Puzzl → Dart)?

Milestones. What are 2-3 major milestones you want to accomplish over the next 12-24 months?
