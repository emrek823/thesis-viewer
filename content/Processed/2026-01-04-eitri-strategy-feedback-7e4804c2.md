# Eitri 2026 Strategy Feedback: What Changed, What Matters Now

Research Date: 2026-01-04 | Source Mix: 80% Vault / 20% Web | Confidence: HIGH

The Take: Quinn has made the right strategic pivots in 2025—from broad "intelligence layer" positioning to a specific wedge (batch disposition), from solo founder to a complementary technical team. The question for 2026 isn't whether the market opportunity is real (it is—$3B+ annually wasted on manual tech transfer alone), but whether Eitri can convert batch disposition traction into defensible position before incumbents (Veeva Batch Release, Apprentice.io) bolt AI onto existing install bases. The proof points needed aren't revenue numbers—they're repeat usage patterns and expansion within accounts that signal product-market fit.

## Axis 1: What Changed in 2025 / What We Learned

### Timeline of Evolution

### Key Earned Insights from 2025

1. Buyer persona sharpened: Quality > CMC

October discovery: "ICP evolution: more quality involvement than initially expected. Key user/buyer likely VP or Head of Quality (vs just CMC/technical ops)." Challenge: Quality is cost center.

This matters because it changes the sales motion. Quality teams buy for compliance/risk reduction, not productivity gains. Messaging needs to emphasize audit readiness, deviation tracking, regulatory defensibility—not time savings.

2. Competitive landscape is sparse but not empty

Zach's assessment: "Competitive landscape sparse: Major players Veeva, Benchling, MasterControl; some edge solutions like Apprentice.io."

November concern: "Process optimization space crowded: Catalyze AI, Arc Biotech, Datahow. Contradiction: VCs excited vs process scientists saying 'solved in 90s with existing equations.'"

What this tells us: Process optimization is a VC trap. Batch disposition/tech transfer is the right wedge—less crowded, clearer buyer pain.

3. Product roadmap confidence is appropriately uncertain

Quinn's November assessment: "Product roadmap confidence: 60-70% for 90 days, 30% for 12 months."

This is healthy for the stage. Over-confidence here would be a red flag.

4. Market thesis refined and validated

December articulation: "Central thesis: Decentralized manufacturing becoming increasingly specialized... Virtual biotechs (10-person teams) struggle to navigate constellation of manufacturing partners."

This is now sharper than the original "intelligence layer for biopharma manufacturing."

## Axis 2: Market Opportunity & Product Wedge for 2026

### Market Size Context

Key insight: The AI-integrated CDMO market is growing at 20.6% CAGR—faster than underlying CDMO growth. This validates that software is capturing share of services spend, not just growing with the market.

### What Creates Wedge (Defensibility)

GxP/FDA Validation (18-24 month moat) — Any AI system touching manufacturing data needs validation. Competitors cannot replicate without their own compliance journey.

Data Integration Depth (compounding lock-in) — Once batch genealogy, deviation history, and process parameters live in your system, switching means re-integrating DeltaV historians, IP21 sensors, SAP genealogy, lab readings.

Process-Specific Model Validation — Models validated against specific equipment cannot transfer to different CDMO equipment without re-validation.

Federated Visibility Creates Bilateral Dependency — Shared sponsor-CDMO visibility creates switching friction on both sides.

### Feature-Level Switching Costs

### Competitive Landscape: Batch Records & Quality

What this means for Eitri:

Veeva Batch Release is the most direct competitor—but it's visibility, not intelligence

Apprentice.io has AI credibility but focused on MES/recipe execution, not batch review

The gap Eitri occupies (batch disposition + tech transfer intelligence) is still underserved

### The Wedge Decision: Batch Disposition vs Tech Transfer

Option A: Batch Disposition (current focus)

Pros: Repeatable use case (4-6x/year per product), quantified pain (18-20 hours/run), quality buyer is stable

Cons: Lower ACV ceiling, competing with Veeva Batch Release, requires OCR accuracy excellence

Evidence: Skylark implementation validates the workflow

Option B: Tech Transfer Automation

Pros: 8+ month manual process, $1M+ per transfer, no AI system automates today

Cons: Lumpy revenue (one-time per product), requires cross-company data exchange, longer sales cycle

Evidence: From research—"The 8+ month manual bottleneck is the most underserved."

Recommendation: Batch disposition is the right wedge because it creates recurring touchpoints. Tech transfer is the expansion opportunity once you're in the account.

## Proof Points Needed for Next Funding Round

### Must-Haves (Table Stakes)

2-3 paying customers beyond Skylark ($50K+ ACV each)

One CDMO design partner (validates two-sided marketplace thesis)

Retention signal: Skylark renewed and expanded usage

### Would-Be-Great

Cross-account expansion: One customer using both batch disposition AND another module

Quality buyer testimonial: VP Quality or Chief Quality Officer validating compliance value

Competitive displacement: Won a deal against Veeva Batch Release or manual process

### Red Flags to Avoid

Revenue from one-time services (implementation fees) rather than recurring platform

Customer concentration >50% in single account

Team additions without customer traction (hiring ahead of signal)

## Questions to Pose in Response

### On Thesis Evolution

The "decentralized manufacturing" framing is stronger than "intelligence layer." Has customer discovery validated that buyers use this language, or is it investor-facing positioning?

You've separated process optimization from the core platform. What triggered that decision—customer feedback, competitive analysis, or team capability assessment?

### On 2026 Priorities

If you had to choose between (a) expanding Skylark into tech transfer work or (b) landing a second batch disposition customer, which would you prioritize and why?

The quality buyer (VP Quality) is a cost center. How are you positioning the ROI conversation—compliance risk reduction, audit time savings, or batch release acceleration?

### On Competitive Dynamics

Veeva Batch Release launched "real-time visibility" messaging. Have you encountered them in deals? What's the differentiation when they're already in the account for QMS?

Apprentice.io just announced Veeva integrations in their 7.5 release. Does this validate your thesis (ecosystems converging) or threaten it (incumbents adding features)?

### On Proof Points

What's the minimum viable signal that batch disposition is working? Is it usage frequency (logins, queries), customer expansion requests, or referral conversations?

At what point would you pivot from batch disposition to tech transfer as the primary wedge?

## Summary Assessment

What Quinn got right in 2025:

Chose the right first customer (Skylark: small, accessible, real pain)

Built complementary team (Zach = ML, Sam = data infra, Quinn = domain + product)

Narrowed from broad platform to specific wedge (batch disposition)

Avoided the process optimization trap (crowded, dubious differentiation)

What needs sharpening for 2026:

Buyer persona clarity: Is it VP Quality or Head of Technical Ops? Different value props.

Pricing model: $2,500 MVP doesn't scale. Path to six-figure ACV needs articulation.

Competitive positioning: Veeva Batch Release is the comparison customers will make.

Expansion hypothesis: How does batch disposition → tech transfer → platform?

Bull case: Eitri becomes the "Palantir for biopharma operations"—first in with batch disposition, expands into tech transfer, builds data moat that compounds with every batch run. GxP validation (12-18 months) creates barrier.

Bear case: Veeva adds AI features to Batch Release faster than expected; Apprentice.io expands from MES into batch review; Eitri's SMB biotech customers churn as they get acquired or fail (10% survival rate per expert interviews).

I want to highlight the investor vs. customer facing capabilities

Lets really go back and foth on right wedge and questions we should ask quinn to validate that beyond tegus reports and 1 or 2 convos
