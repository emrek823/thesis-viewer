### Current TPA Focus & Challenges

- Working with 3 TPAs currently (2 more closely than third)
- Main challenge: Long-tail payer serving self-funded insurance plans
- TPAs typically less technologically forward-thinking
- Key pain points identified:
	- Auto-adjudication rates need improvement without quality decrease
	- Human resources scaling (currently 250-400 lives per employee, aim for 1000-1500)
	- Provider calls represent 60% of customer service volume

### Product Strategy & Value Proposition

- Building wedge at claims processing start
- Offering top-of-funnel entry point for:
	- Primary editing from payment integrity standpoint
	- Claims validation and cleaning
	- Improved adjudication process
- Historical data approach:
	- TPAs more comfortable with historical data vs. live pipeline
	- Analyzing claims and provider data tables
	- Providing interpreted data and validation
- Focus shifting from cost reduction to revenue generation potential

### Go-to-Market Considerations

- Three potential approaches under consideration:
	- Build a TPA
	- Buy a TPA
	- Sell software to TPAs
- Industry insights:
	- Hard to get initial foot in the door
	- Strong conference/network connections between TPAs
	- Low risk tolerance in the space
- Potential expansion into self-administration for large employers
	- Broker interest identified
	- Current market lacks suitable solutions

### Timeline & Next Steps

- No formal entity yet
- Aiming for software deployment to customers by end of next week
- 4-6 week critical period to validate thesis
- Identifying trusted advisers/consultants for industry credibility
- Targeting more structured plan by July/early August
- Focusing on building product and customer validation before formal investment discussions

### Market Context

- Competitors like Yuzu and Avant building from ground up but showing slower scaling
- TPAs recognize importance of automation (“more bots than butts” philosophy)
- Strong industry interconnectedness through conferences and networks
- Growing interest in self-administration options from large employers
