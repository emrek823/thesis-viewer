## Slide 6: Administrative Complexity and Inefficiency

US HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY

Excessive administrative complexity has created widespread inefficiency in U.S.
healthcare, straining resources and eroding margins.

### Chart: Growth of Physicians and Administrators since 1970(1)

**Growth of Physicians and Administrators in U.S.**

*Y-axis:* Growth since 1970 (0% to 3500%)
*X-axis:* Year (1970 to 2015)

*Data (approximate from graph):*
*   **Managers (red/brown area):** Shows rapid, almost exponential growth. From 1970 to 2015, managers grew by approximately 3000%.
*   **Physicians (green area):** Shows much slower, more linear growth. From 1970 to 2015, physicians grew by approximately 100%.

*Source:* Bureau of Labor Statistics; NCHS; Himmelstein/Woolhandler analysis of CPS
Managers shown as moving average of current year and two previous years

### Commentary (2)

*   Administrative layers have expanded dramatically across contracting, credentialing, billing, coding, and revenue cycle management, while clinical capacity has remained relatively flat.
*   This imbalance has produced system-wide inefficiency, shifting focus and resources away from patient care and toward paperwork and compliance.
*   The result is higher costs, slower processes, and declining margins, particularly for smaller practices that lack the scale to manage administrative burden.
*   These inefficiencies persist despite rising healthcare spending — highlighting the urgent need for new approaches to streamline operations and refocus on care delivery.

## Slide 7: Administrative Costs and Staffing

US HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY

Administrative complexity costs practices up to 35% of their revenue and requires
more administrators than clinicians to operate.

### Table: Administrative Functions, FTEs, and % of Revenue

| Function | Description | FTEs Required (Per 10 Providers) | % of Revenue |
| :------------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------- | :------------- |
| Revenue Cycle Management (RCM) | Includes billing, coding, and collections             | 2-3                              | 6-10%          |
| Eligibility & Benefits Checks   | Verifying patient insurance + authorizations          | 1-2                              | 3-5%           |
| Scheduling & Rescheduling     | Appointment setting, cancellations, optimization      | 1-1.5                            | 2-4%           |
| Patient Intake & Registration   | Collecting forms, uploading ID/insurance            | 0.5-1                            | 1-2%           |
| Clinical Documentation Support  | Transcription, note cleanup, EMR entry assistance   | 1-1.5                            | 3-5%           |
| Overall Admin Overhead          | Overarching staff ops, training, compliance           | 1-2                              | 5-7%           |
| Contracting & Credentialing   | Negotiating payor contracts, enrolling providers with insurers | 0.5-1                            | 1-2%           |

### Commentary

*   Up to 35% of practice revenue is spent on non-clinical administrative tasks
*   This materializes in full-time staffing of up to 12 people for every 10-providers, greater than the number of clinicians
*   Tasks such as eligibility checks, prior authorizations, and scheduling are predominantly manual, leading to increased labor costs and potential for errors
*   RCM activities, including billing and coding, can consume a significant portion of practice resources, constituting 6%+ of revenue alone
*   Delays in provider credentialing and contracting with payers can postpone revenue generation, affecting cash flow

### AI Intake and Front-End RCM Detail

**AI Intake & Benefits Verification**
1.  24/7 AI agent collects insurance info, verifies eligibility in real-time via payor API or portal scraping
2.  NLP extracts key benefit information: co-pays, deductibles, limits, auth requirements
3.  Syncs structured benefit data directly into EMR and billing systems for clean claims and pricing transparency

**AI Prior Authorization Automation**
1.  AI auto-fills prior auth forms using EMR data + verified benefits information
2.  Agent submits to payer portals and tracks authorization status in real time
3.  Flags denials or missing info and sends smart alerts to staff for resolution

## Slide 14: Investment Economics: AI Impact on Provider Profit

INVESTMENT ECONOMICS

Across demand generation, utilization improvement, and operational efficiency, AI
tooling has the opportunity to more than double the profit of services assets.

*   **AI-powered marketing tools personalize outreach, optimize channels dynamically, and predict patient needs to improve funnel, and automated intake, scheduling improves conversion**
*   **Ambient scribe reduces administrative time spent writing notes, allowing for providers to see more patients. Automated follow-up further reduces need for non-clinical time.**
*   **Intake, benefit verification, scheduling, and reminders fully automated by AI agents, reducing front-office staffing**
*   **AI drastically reduces RCM expenses, automating capture, coding, submission, and collections while improving collections**
*   **Net impact is ~75% improvement in profit margin through the more efficient use of AI, before any other improvements**
