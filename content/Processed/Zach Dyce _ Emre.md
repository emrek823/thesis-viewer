### Background & Journey

- FL State graduate who hustled into Wall Street banking
- Got fired after first year - learned tough lessons about pushing back on directives
- Moved to BCG (better fit), then to Kenya during COVID
- Worked at Jumia (Amazon of Africa) - launched 20-minute grocery delivery across 10 African countries
	- Learned about hype cycles, customer acquisition costs, core business fundamentals
- Mother died during Stanford GSB admission - shifted focus to healthcare/addiction space
- No prior healthcare background but developed passion for Medicaid, addiction, social determinants

### Current Focus & Business Model

- Won year-long Stanford fellowship to explore healthcare automation
- Signed design partnership with Catholic Charities in DC for QA/QI automation
- Target: “Eleos for the long tail” - streamlined version at 1/3 the price
	- Eleos charges $75k/year for 25 users - too expensive for long tail Medicaid providers
	- Focus on basic functionality that gets results vs full-featured expensive solutions
- Mission: shift margin from administrative side to care delivery side
	- CBOs aren’t inefficient within their systems but lack tech innovation
	- Administrative tasks aren’t complex - 75% AI accuracy sufficient vs perfect solutions

### Market Opportunity & Timing

- Confluence of factors creating urgency:
	- AI awareness but unclear implementation beyond basic scribing
	- Funding spigot drying up forcing inward cost-cutting focus
	- Success in primary care Medicaid making behavioral health more receptive
- 70% of contacted organizations actively thinking about QA automation
	- Many getting organizations to QA team meetings immediately
- Validation focus: can this scale to IPAs and achieve meaningful ARR?

### Next Steps & Timeline

- August: Sign MOUs with organizations, scope prototype requirements
- September: Deploy basic MVP proving time/money savings with measurable KPIs
- Q4: Validate scalability and market size, reach couple hundred k ARR range
- June 2026: Current runway through grants and accumulated funds
- Requests: Intros to Medicaid providers, SaaS-to-healthcare sales experience, technical integration expertise
