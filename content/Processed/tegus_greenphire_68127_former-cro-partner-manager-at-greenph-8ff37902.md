# Greenphire - Former CRO Partner Manager at Greenphire
## Interview conducted on August 29, 2023

## Topics
Payment Solutions, Clinical Trials, Competition, Technology, Participant Reimbursement, Site Payments, Market Challenges

## Summary
In a conversation between a Tegus Client and a former CRO Partner Manager at Greenphire, it was discussed that Greenphire initially provided a reimbursement solution for paying participants in clinical studies and later expanded to include travel assistance and site payment solutions. They recently added a budget creation solution for investigator sites. The former manager emphasized the value of CRO partnerships, which accounted for a little less than half of Greenphire's revenue, as they allowed Greenphire's solutions to be included in bids made to pharma and biotech companies. However, there are some complaints about Greenphire's product, including concerns about their technology not keeping up with advancements in the market and slower response times. The expert mentioned smaller competitors like Mural Health and Scout Clinical that offer slicker participant payment solutions, posing a threat to Greenphire. Greenphire has been working on improving their platform and expanding into areas beyond participant payments with the launch of an app. The expert believes there is still room for growth in the participant reimbursement market, especially in Europe and China. The former manager explained that turnover at Greenphire was not necessarily related to the sale of Thoma Bravo, but more due to the demanding nature of the work. They joined Greenphire to actively seek out opportunities and navigate the entire sales process.

## Expert Details
Business Development Director at ArcheMedX, Inc. The expert is responsible for selling software and services into life science organizations for 20+ years, with a focus on R&D and clinical technologies.

Prior to ArcheMedX, Inc., the expert was the CRO Partner Manager at Greenphire, leaving in May 2023.

### Tegus Client
Thank you for taking the time to talk about the clinical payment space, specifically with the NI toward payments, mainly for participants or patients but also for sites as well. So can you start by talking about your background and tell us a bit about Greenphire in terms of their product that they offer customers, the types of customers they serve?

### Former CRO Partner Manager at Greenphire
So Greenphire, when they started, they filled a need that was out there because there was no solution out there to easily pay participants in clinical studies. So the genesis of Greenphire was really hit the market at a great time. So it was to make it easier for people to participate in clinical studies. And they built off that. They have ClinCard, which is the participant reimbursement. Then they built out to that of travel assistance part.

So those are very complementary. And then they added in the site payment solution, which is very closely related, not complementary, but almost two sides of the same coin type of thing. And then recently, they added in another solution in the last couple of years, which is the front end of the site payment process, which is the budget creation for the investigator sites.

### Tegus Client
Is that budget creation for the site investigation?

### Former CRO Partner Manager at Greenphire
Yes. So if you think of a study and if you think of what the payment is doing to the investigator sites, it's paying the site for the activities that they are doing in that clinical study. Well, the budget is at the very front end where the sponsor company and/or CRO agree with the site that, here's what you're going to do and here's what we're going to pay you for those activities. So the budget is almost a framework that's around the payments that go out to the site.

### Tegus Client
So it's helping give more clarity upfront to an agreed-upon payment amount for the activities that a sponsor anticipates a site will conduct on their behalf?

### Former CRO Partner Manager at Greenphire
Yes. Because you said it's helping to put that framework, no. It is a framework. So it's a legal document, it's a contract. The budget is part of the clinical trial agreement or CTA. That's a contract that the investigator site signs with the sponsor company or the CRO that says, "Here are all the things we agreed to, and part of that is the budget." So it's very detailed spelled-out regimented in terms of here's what you're going to do. We're not going to pay you for two initiation visits for the same patient. So there's just certain things that get spilled out, and it's across the entire life of the visits for each patient in that study.

### Tegus Client
So that was a recent product that they released, and is that part of the site payments? It's an add-on to the site payment or it's a separate product entirely?

### Former CRO Partner Manager at Greenphire
It's both, it can be a stand-alone, but part of the value prop for that is so you can build out your budget. And the thing that Greenphire uses as a selling point for that is, we've got great data that's going to help guide you to what these payments should be because we were making these payments for the last almost 15 years.

So there's a sense of what the industry calls fair market value in the creation of those budgets. So it can be a stand-alone or you can create the budget in a Greenphire solution. Now that you've created those budgets, now you can feed those into the site payment solutions. So now it just sort of flows in from one to the other. It's like, here's your planning piece, now move it over into the execution piece.

### Tegus Client
Walk us through what you were responsible for as a CRO partner manager. And to be clear, does that mean you were the Chief Revenue Officer? Or what is that partner manager designation?

### Former CRO Partner Manager at Greenphire
So CRO partner manager in Life Sciences is clinical contract research organization.

### Tegus Client
So you were managing those partnerships?

### Former CRO Partner Manager at Greenphire
Yes. So there were several teams in the commercial organization at Greenphire. One team focused on the partnerships with CROs so that was a team that I had. There was a team that focused on large pharma and those are like enterprise agreements. I know that's public information, organizations like that, so who are going to be very high volume and high touch, high care type customer.

So there's a team that focused on that. There's a team that focused on the SMB pharma and biotech. And then there was a team that focused on research sites or site networks. Think of research institutions that may have several sites, and they may want to make the payment directly out to the people who are participating in their studies. So there was a nice sale that could be made out to those types of organizations

more around the participant reimbursement and then also the travel. So think of any company out there, who is looking to create a solution and it's only going to be for participant reimbursement.

I don't think there's any company out there that's their only sole focus, even if they've been around for a while. The idea now is you do the payments, the travel piece, those go so closely together, but even more so, just a lot of patient information, a lot of patient convenience, a lot of patient interactions.

So there's a number of different technologies and different solutions that now companies like Greenphire, other competitors and even CROs, they're, "Hey, we're going to build out payment solutions, and we're going to build a bunch of patient interaction type of capabilities in there." So that's really where the market is going.

### Tegus Client
So walk through the specifics. So, you had a team focused on partnerships with CROs and that was your team?

### Former CRO Partner Manager at Greenphire
Correct.

### Tegus Client
You had one focus on partnerships with clinical research sites?

### Former CRO Partner Manager at Greenphire
Yes. Think of them as site network.

### Tegus Client
And what's the site network? How do you define that?

### Former CRO Partner Manager at Greenphire
So a site network would be an organization, it could be an academic institution or it could be a for-profit organization, but it could have up to really unlimited, hundreds of different investigator sites. So think a doctor's offices, so a number of offices that they're managing. So some take more of a hands-on like, we own everything about these sites from an operational down to a medical type of purview where other types of organizations take more of a, you guys are going to handle the medical stuff your own.

We're going to do back office and operational type stuff and pull that away so that you don't have to worry about that. So those types of organizations they see a lot of patients come through and what they do? So, all organizations that are site networks are interested in clinical studies because there has been a high volume of patients.

### Tegus Client
So walk me through the specifics of your role as a CRO partner manager. What were you responsible for? You manage those partnerships with CROs. What does that look like?

### Former CRO Partner Manager at Greenphire
So very high level, the CRO, the importance of the CRO partnerships were that they would act as a multiplier. There'd be a multiplier effect in terms of Greenphire would go or any customer, any vendor, any solution provider.

We'll go to a CRO and instead of the solution provider having the call on 10, 20 different pharma biotech companies, you go to a CRO who are already calling on all those companies. So you need to get your solution into a position where, number one, the CRO agrees that there's value to it and then they want to start including into their bids that they then make out to the pharma and biotech companies.

Some CROs take an approach of, "Hey, we love this, and this is how we're going to pay all of our participants,

or this is how we're going to pay all of our investigator sites." And that's just part of every proposal we send out and other CROs take the approach of, we love it.

We don't know if each individual sponsor is going to love it or want to pay for it. So what we're going to do is put it in as an optional line item and then they can select whether they want to include it in the study or not. As a service provider, you want to get to the point where that CRO says we love it. This is our internal tool. We're just going to bake it into the cost of the overall budget we give back to the sponsor company. And that's how the solution provider gets a lot more usage and more ingrained.

### Tegus Client
And do you have a sense for the amount that Greenphire would sell through CROs versus direct to sponsor?

### Former CRO Partner Manager at Greenphire
Yes. It's probably a little bit less than half.

### Tegus Client
Meaning less than half was sold through CROs?

### Former CRO Partner Manager at Greenphire
Yes, but not much less than half. So if you look at revenues, 60% was sponsored biotech, 40% CROs or maybe 65-35. And it's the SMB segment, would be 10% of that 65% and the other 90% of that was the large companies. So the two revenue drivers for Greenphire. And I think this is probably true for all solution providers out there. The CROs were a big part and the large pharma was a big part and then the SMB not as big.

And the key reason being the smaller biotechs and pharma companies, they're not looking to build out this infrastructure and teams that are going to do these capabilities. So they're like, listen, our CRO is running everything for us. So site payments, they're going to do it. Participant payments, they're going to do it. So that's why the CRO channel was valuable.

### Tegus Client
So if you look at the total volume and annual revenue done by Greenphire, you're saying a little less than half of that is being sold through CRO partnerships and then the other half is being sold direct to a sponsor to push down on their CROs or participant sites. Is that right?

### Former CRO Partner Manager at Greenphire
Yes.

### Tegus Client
And you think about the product itself, were you pretty close to the Greenphire product in terms of getting CRO feedback on the Greenphire product?

### Former CRO Partner Manager at Greenphire
Yes, from an internal product perspective.

### Tegus Client
What were some of the product development areas or maybe areas of weaknesses or common completes or pushbacks you get on the product from CROs?

### Former CRO Partner Manager at Greenphire
I don't know that it's specific to just CROs. I think it's broader in terms of what some of the complaint might be. So the biggest complaint would be Greenphire started 15 years ago, the technology was great at the time and hasn't kept up with the technology. I know new players in the market, that's one of the things that they

use. So that they use the technology. They use the product, there's a fair amount of people behind the solution, operational people.

And as Greenphire has gotten bigger, that part of delivering the solution has gotten bigger. So I know some of the newer vendors say, "Hey, look, we can turn quicker." Is it age-old stories, hey, these guys are big, are they going to be slower. Or they're going to be not as reactive to your needs.

### Tegus Client
And then you found that to be true? Or is that just marketing? Have you found that to be true inside the company?

### Former CRO Partner Manager at Greenphire
Yes, think of any organization bureaucracy if you want to call it that. So yes, I would say that's the case. There's a lot of moving parts for the solution. And I think one of the things that some of the newer vendors are looking to do is say, we're just providing you the technology.

But there's a missing piece, because it's not something you can just say, "Here you go." It's a word process or a spreadsheet now you're totally self-sufficient at that point. There's a lot of regulation. There's a lot of things, intelligence that you need to have to build out the solution correctly. So while that operational piece was big, it got that way for reasons that were important.

### Tegus Client
And when you talk about how the technology hasn't kept up, what are some examples of that?

### Former CRO Partner Manager at Greenphire
Are there off-the-shelf APIs that I can now just hook up my systems that I'm using to your solution Greenphire, and now we're off and running? And it's a little bit of a double-edged sword, because, that was an issue that would come up and companies, especially now with newer technologies and new vendors saying, "Hey, we can connect very easily and automatically."

But for the type of solution and the amount of data going back and forth or maybe the frequency, it wasn't as big an issue as maybe what someone might make it out to be or what a competitor might try to make it out to be. So you had to have data flowing back and forth, and you could do it through a monthly data feed of throw a file out into a secure file site type of thing or you could do an API connection. Sometimes those are very difficult to get in place with the company.

But I think optics of, hey, you guys are a technology company, and we can't just connect into you easily. That's going to be a problem. How are you not at a point where we can easily interface and interoperate with your solution? And no matter who it is, no matter what they're selling, technology companies, they're all going to say they have the interoperability. Even Greenphire, It's just a matter of once you start getting it in, how easy is it really to connect? So I know that some of the conversations that I've heard. And it's not necessarily just CROs, it's the pharma companies as well.

### Tegus Client
What about the actual physical debit card dynamic? So one thing that we've heard is around just the fees and the complexity and the clunkiness of that as opposed to using more modern experiences like Zelle, Venmo, things that customers are used to using in their everyday life, at least in the United States and more kind of technology-focused countries like that.

### Former CRO Partner Manager at Greenphire
That has come up, so the life sciences industry is very risk-averse. So the whole compliance piece comes into play. So there are some companies that don't want to go down that road yet until they are more comfortable with FDA and like EMA, other organizations, other regulatory agencies saying this is going to work in a clinical trial framework. So they tend to be more risk-averse.

So while that is a topic of discussion, can you pay people through Zelle, can you pay them Bitcoin? So it's a current topic, but I don't know that it's a decision right now that people are buying or not buying based on just that. I think in a year or two, but that's probably the far end of that spectrum. I think in a couple of years, that will become a much bigger issue.

They've announced that now there's more flexible ways to pay participants. They've changed some of the ways in terms of how they set the rails up for the payments to be made. So they've got more flexibility now around how they can make those payments. But there is the whole debit card piece. So the ease of it, the footprint on the environment. Those are all things that we've heard that, hey, this is not really the best way to move forward.

### Tegus Client
What are some examples of ways that Greenphire has made their payments more flexible? Could you give some specific examples of maybe new additions or tangible ways to think about that?

### Former CRO Partner Manager at Greenphire
So they changed the vendor who was providing the payment rails for them. And that just introduced the whole another level of flexibility. Think of within a country, if one payment provider can't do ACH within a country, now you're talking about wire, which is very expensive compared to an ACH.

So just see the switch of payment providers providing better flexibility around what was available within different countries, but then also that switch also provided a much lower price point even for the same types of transactions within specific countries. So that was probably the biggest, which in terms of providing better flexibility and lower cost around how the payments are done.

But also there was just a shift in understanding of, "Hey, we can't just keep providing debit cards only, right, or direct deposit. We need to look into other types of payment methods." So it's going to be a shift over time to get every customer over to that type of capability where they can have a number of different modalities in terms of how they can pay, but they're on that road for sure.

### Tegus Client
And does Greenphire make a decent amount of money off the fees associated with those physical cards? Is Greenphire benefiting from that or all of those fees being paid directly to the card issuer?

### Former CRO Partner Manager at Greenphire
So all the transaction-related fees that were part of what would get into a contract with the customer, all those were handled purely as pass-through. So there was no markup at all based on a wire transfer fee and direct deposit. Those are all just, hey, what's this payment provider charging us, and we're just passing that right back through to the customers. So there was no markup on that piece.

### Tegus Client
You're saying you would pass that through to the customer, meaning if I were a participant in the study and I incur fee through that credit card provider, you are not paying for that as Greenphire, but you're passing that on to me as a participant so I have to incur that fee. Am I understanding that right?

### Former CRO Partner Manager at Greenphire
No, the customer being the CRO or the pharma, biotech companies, those are the ones who have the contract directly in place with Greenphire. The only fee to the study participant would see, would be they would have a debit card. And there would be money that would get put on that. And then if that's sat idle for six months or more, then there might be some money that would get pulled out of that each month.

But if a participant called in and said, hey, what's going on with this, Greenphire would just re-debit that money back or credit that money back onto that card and say, you've got three months to use it now, type of things. So the participant wouldn't be out any type of money based on any of the transactions. The fees that I was referring to would just be passed through back to the drug company.

If our contract is in place with the CRO, they have their contract in place with the drug company. So they're running a study for the drug company, then that's part of the contract with the drug company like, hey, we're going to have these fees for transactions and the CRO can pass those right back through or they can put some type of uplift on that. Most CROs wouldn't put uplift on. Like if we're not charging anything on the transaction feedback to the CRO, they're not going to uplift that part back to their sponsor company or the pharma company.

### Tegus Client
And as you were building those relationships with CROs, what did you sense was the customer sentiment? Did customers like Greenphire, did they have a lot of complaints? How would you characterize what the sentiment was overall?

### Former CRO Partner Manager at Greenphire
I think overwhelming are you so because you have to think of it as two customer sets. So the end users, which would be the participants, if you're talking about participant reimbursement. And overwhelmingly, 90% or higher satisfied with the solution. That might change all the time as new solutions come out into the market. And if they're more agile and can pay different modalities in a better way, that might change over time.

But from a participant perspective, very happy. For site payments, I'd say 80% satisfaction above. The reason is differences because for the participants, there's very low impact to them. They get a debit card. They can use it, great. For the sites, now all investigator sites are like, listen, you guys are throwing all this technology on us. We have only different solutions for all these different things, all these different parts of the study. So there's always a bit of pushback from that.

So even if you're giving them a payment solution that's going to make their life easier, they can track individual line items and invoices and all that stuff, there's still some level of pushback of another solution that we have to deal with. So I'd say a little bit lower satisfaction from the site. Now if you talk about it from the perspective of the end customers for Greenphire, the CROs, the sponsor companies, drug, biotech, pharma biotech.

That's probably going to be lower in terms of satisfaction rating because now you're not just taking the technology and what might be not as fancy from a user interface perspective as some of the newer solutions out there, but you're also considering the operational piece that's behind the technology. And now you get into that whole bigger team, bureaucracy, maybe slower to respond.

And Greenphire, a lot of activity going on there, a lot of studies that are ongoing, current or new that are coming into the pipeline of work. So there's a lot of moving parts there. So I think that with anything like that, there's a chance that response times start to drop a little bit or things fall off the table. So talk about overall customer satisfaction for the Greenphire customers.

### Tegus Client
So are there deficiencies in the Greenphire product that would allow for a competitor to come in and steal market share? Have you seen or did you see any modern solutions emerging that you think could fit that bill?

### Former CRO Partner Manager at Greenphire
Yes. So I think from the participant payment piece, there are some vendors, so there's Mural Health, the Scout Clinical who've got maybe slicker solutions. These are smaller organizations. From a site payment perspective, the newer companies doing participant reimbursement, they're not all doing site payments because they're two different types of animals. There's a company called Ledger Run, and they've got a very good site payment solution. And what they've done is sort of that whole big operational piece that you wrap around the technology.

They partnered with a consulting company to provide the operational piece. So now Ledger Run can continue as a pure technology play and then as they get bigger, there might be issues with that, in terms of the cohesiveness of the technology with the service delivery part. But just a couple of examples of companies

that have seen, they can provide a threat to Greenphire. They are a threat to Greenphire.

### Tegus Client
And in what way do you think they are a threat, let's take participant payments first?

### Former CRO Partner Manager at Greenphire
So Greenphire's global. These companies are not as big. So maybe they can't operate as much from a global perspective, but from a U.S. or North America perspective, the ability to pay in any modality that the participant wants, the ability to provide to not have to rely on debit cards. That's how these companies have gained their foothold already and then also from a user interface perspective, having a better solution and also having an app for the participants, because Greenphire until maybe six months ago, they didn't have an app for the participants.

So newer solutions, having these things and being able to leverage them name, also playing up the whole, we've got an easier way to interoperate and connect to your existing systems and things like that, that gets people's attention.

### Tegus Client
What does that app do for participants that Greenphire launched? And why did they launch it?

### Former CRO Partner Manager at Greenphire
Well, I think they launched it for a couple of reasons. They launched it as a response to competitors. They launched it because that's where they see the industry going, but then they also launched it because now it's a launch pad for them to do more than just participant payments. So it can become a registry.

So there's a clinical study, but then there's a whole another world of, what about data outside of the clinical study? What if you have Crohn's disease? And we just want to know how you're doing? How is it over time the drug product even think of a COVID test, or the COVID, you got a shot and then you have to answer questions every six months.

That's what they call real-world data and real-world evidence. So that's a big part of, can you collect that information easily. And now we're getting this whole wealth of information and data beyond just a clinical study. Having an app, then allows Greenphire to sort of leverage into that patient registry, real-world data, real-world evidence and then also provide other types of things like more patient interaction, medication adherence types of solutions. So it provides a whole horizon where Greenphire could go.

### Tegus Client
And how does that app compared with some of the moderate solution? Is it on par? Or is it you just cobble this together to have something to compete?

### Former CRO Partner Manager at Greenphire
I think it's competitive. And the underpinnings of the app for Greenphire was through an acquisition that they made, but it wasn't like you got built in a think tank and it had the already existing biases within Greenphire that help to build it. It was a competitive solution that Greenphire went out and bought.

### Tegus Client
So that was from an acquisition. Do you recall the name of the company?

### Former CRO Partner Manager at Greenphire
I don't.

### Tegus Client
Anything else that was on the road map for Greenphire, on the participant payment side or ways that you saw them react and provide improvements to that product to compete with competitors, modern

competitors in particular?

### Former CRO Partner Manager at Greenphire
From a product perspective, those are the key things. There were a lot of initiatives internally around the operations and how to better streamline that.

### Tegus Client
Meaning the headcount that was required on the back end, just to streamline that?

### Former CRO Partner Manager at Greenphire
Yes. And redesign the application so that it would make the operations run smoother too because let's say it was written in a certain way when now someone had to go in and perform some type of manual task to do something to reengineer the solution and the platform and the application to now do those types of things to free up or eliminate those manual tests.

### Tegus Client
What's your sense on modern players like Mural health? Do you think they have a viable chance of competing? How do you envision them performing?

### Former CRO Partner Manager at Greenphire
I don't know Sam Whitaker, the CEO, but he founded Greenphire. I've heard him on a couple of interviews and he moved on because we wanted to be somewhere where they could disrupt the industry. So I don't underestimate anyone like that who can create a company like Greenphire and grow it.

So he's starting out participant reimbursement, but I'm sure he's looking lots of different directions of, where do I need to be, not where do I want to be in the next year or two? So I think there's a lot of room out there as well. It's 15 years old, the participant reimbursement world or solution, better solutions. I think there's still a lot of room to grow.

I think that Europe isn't as booked in. There's still France, Germany privacy issues. So there's still some things to sort of figure out along the way for those types of countries and maybe even regions. China hardly touched. So there's going to be some interesting stuff the next five to 10 years that someone, who is really at the forefront of that, is going to really be able to take advantage of those things.

### Tegus Client
How does the company or employee-based feel about him exiting to start that company? And what was that departure like?

### Former CRO Partner Manager at Greenphire
So that's an interesting question because I only know it from coming in after the fact. But there's still a lot of people there who speak very highly of Sam because Sam was running the company when they joined or they were the first 50 employees in the company. And there are employees who jump Greenphire to go join Sam. And then there's people who really don't have positive things to say about Sam.

But if you look at who's saying it and why they might be seeing it, it's because Sam is perceived as a threat to them. So some of the faults in the commercial organization, some of the faults in the executive suite. And it's not that they're bashing him or bad mouthing him, but like you heard things like the guys got to meet two solution.

You couldn't go out and figure out if he's so smart, why can't he go create something totally different, that type of stuff. So nothing like all this guys certified lunatic or he doesn't know what he is doing. So I think he is perceived as a threat. And I think because he has been successful that people feel like, okay, maybe he's going to do it again.

How much of a threat is Mural health for Greenphire? Did you guys talk about that a lot, we got to make sure we're just mimicking everything that they do? How did they think about the scale of that threat?

### Former CRO Partner Manager at Greenphire
I think there are smaller players out there who've gotten some market share like Mural Health, like Scout Clinical. There are CROs who are building their own participant payment solutions like Syneos Health. I think internally Greenphire look at them and say, what's the threat here? So with Sam, looks like a good technology guy knows the industry. So how do we come back and compete against him.

And price was never really the other factor. So you think of the overall amount of the clinical study and then pay a couple of hundred, extra thousand or whatever for a solution across the $30 million study. You gladly do that if you get the peace of mind that the solution is going to be solid. So it was more so how do we convey the messaging and how do we combat these small guys.

And convey the messaging, do you really want to trust your study to the small organization, may not be able to support your study, especially if you're talking about multiregional, multi-country or global. So Greenphire being the 800-pound gorilla in the room, they can get some attention on those topics by bringing those up. But I think where the newer vendors probably getting more headway are smaller U.S. only or North America-only type studies, and they're having some success there.

### Tegus Client
And do you have a sense for how many clinical trials out there fall into that bucket of small U.S. only or North American only as opposed to global?

### Former CRO Partner Manager at Greenphire
I don't. There's probably 7,000 to 8,000 studies a year globally, and that subset of those would be U.S. only. So the number will most likely be dropping. COVID everything went down, and then everything came back. But now as the funding is starting to dry up into the biotechs, and I think playing into that is the pricing discussions. So the economy is slowing down, everyone worried about that. So I think that's one factor. I think that the buzz and the noise about the drug pricing also has people like, where is it headed?

### Tegus Client
Meaning the fact that these patents are coming up and the knockoffs are taking over. Is that what you mean?

### Former CRO Partner Manager at Greenphire
No. More so that they just announced today that they identified 10 drugs that they're still under patent and they're highly used. And those are going to be the first 10 drugs that Medicare starts to negotiate pricing. So previously, it was like, you guys came up with this silver bullet drug, and you can charge $1 million of treatment or whatever that number is almost sky's the limit. And I think there's a perception that maybe the sky is not the limit anymore.

So the money dries up and then all right, look at the biotech. They're laying people off. It's just several repercussions going on. And I think that will then drive to a lower number of studies. It will make solution providers more valuable because now each study becomes more important.

### Tegus Client
You were there for about a year, what was the impetus for you leaving? I know that with the sale of Thoma Bravo there is a lot of turnover, whether voluntary or involuntary. And how should we think about the impact to Greenphire in that capacity?

### Former CRO Partner Manager at Greenphire
So Thoma Bravo bought in before I joined. I think there was turnover, but I don't think that's related to a

Thoma Bravo. I think that's more related to just the way the company was run, and a lot of the turnover was on the operations side because it's just a lot of work, the people like to churn through the work. So I think maybe there was some carryover from that.

So I came on board to sell specific solutions like the newer solutions and the positions to more of just managing the ongoing churn of business. And I'm not really an order taker in terms of how many those do you want? I'd like to go out and hunt and find the opportunities and find the right people and figure out the messaging and work down the opportunity, all the steps and qualification and all of that.

### Tegus Client
Got it. Thank you for the time. Have a great day.
