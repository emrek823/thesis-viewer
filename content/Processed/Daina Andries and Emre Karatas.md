### Company Overview & Traction

- Co-founders: Mark Stephenson (serial entrepreneur, 15+ years) and Daina Andries (CEO since January 2024)
- Bootstrapped with $650K friends/family funding last year, $300K additional raised recently
- Current customers:
	- 3 PBMs working with them now
	- 1 signed paid contract (PBM contractor, closed August 2024)
	- 2 in free trials converting to paid
- Automating prior authorization for payers and PBMs
	- Addressing labor shortage (pharmacists hard to find)
	- PBMs lose money on PA process, tight margins

### Product Demo & Workflow

- Asklepios: HIPAA-compliant LLM for prior auth processing
	- Format agnostic (PDF, fax, secure email)
	- Strips PII, fully anonymizes data
	- Processes unstructured documents, extracts key data points
	- Provides clinical recommendations based on FDA guidelines
- Apothecary: Clinical policy curation service
	- Upload plan guidelines as documents (no manual rule building)
	- Automatic extraction into structured objects
	- Dynamic application based on medication, diagnosis, account matching
	- Addresses major pain point: updating clinical policies aligned with standard of care
	- Liability risk for outdated criteria (example: Humira criteria from 2005 causing million-dollar lawsuit)
- Current limitation: Not yet integrated with formulary data or plan-specific utilization management policies

### Vision & Fundraising

- Long-term thesis: Personalized medication experience using more patient data
	- Pharmacogenomics expansion planned
	- Patient-centric, outcomes-focused approach
	- Data follows members across plans within ecosystem
- Fundraising details:
	- Raising $1M total ($700K committed/raised)
	- $8M valuation via SAFEs/convertible notes
	- Early investors getting more aggressive discounts

### Next Steps

- Epidaurus to send updated deck and demo videos
- Virtue VC partner sync Tuesday, potential second 60-minute call with pre-sent questions
- 7-10 day diligence process if second call goes well
