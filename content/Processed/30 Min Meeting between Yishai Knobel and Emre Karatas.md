### Yishai’s Background & Company

- Third venture backed company for Yishai
	- First: Help Around (diabetes support network, became Craigslist for Type 1 supplies)
	- Second: Rxware/Arc Square (prescription abandonment, $3M ARR, 40% reduction in abandonment for 20+ pharma brands)
	- Left Arc Square due to cap table issues after not cleaning up between ventures
- Co-founder from BetterHelp B2B team (grew 0 to $45M ARR through employer channel)
- Both founders experienced in B2B2C patient activation

### Gracie Care Business Model

- Home care agencies as primary acquisition channel
	- Agencies lose money when patients hospitalized (52% hospitalized annually)
	- Offering differentiation beyond “people who wipe the butt”
	- Want to position as “tip of the spear” with comprehensive medical coordination
	- Pilot showed 3 of 6 agencies didn’t engage, other 3 sent steady referrals
- PIN codes as wedge into broader care coordination
	- Direct Medicare billing (no clinic-by-clinic sales like RPM)
	- 60% gross margins starting point, targeting 70% with AI efficiency gains
	- $3,744 ARPU assumption
- AI-driven margin improvement
	- Replace non-billable work (scheduling, family updates, chart review)
	- Automated documentation (transcript to SOAP notes via CMS guidelines)
	- Billing optimization module on Athena EMR to reduce denials
- Growth path: PIN wedge → virtual primary care for elderly → broader vendor marketplace

### Fundraising & Next Steps

- $1M from Arkin Capital committed
- $100K from Alon Matas (BetterHelp founder)
- $50K additional committed
- $600K available in current round
- Emre to discuss with Sean over weekend (expecting second baby)
- Will provide decision by Monday
- Yishai offered to send SAFE note if needed over weekend
