## Slide 4: How Data Ecosystems are Broken Today

How Data Ecosystems are Broken
Today

**Diagram Description:**
The diagram illustrates a broken data ecosystem.
1.  **Company A** (with a lock icon and "9+0") encrypts and sends data to **Company B**.
2.  Data is sent over **The Internet**.
3.  **Company B** (with a lock icon and "PPP") decrypts data and replicates it for use.

1.  Company A encrypts and sends data to Company B.
2.  Data is sent over the internet.
3.  Company B decrypts data and replicates it for use.

Step 3 is where the trouble starts. Because the data must be replicated for use, a host of problems are introduced.

*   Can't restrict to only legitimate use once decrypted
*   Stray data is risky to both parties, liability concern
*   Long contracts and complicated negotiations
*   Relies on good faith adherence to Terms of Use

## Slide 6: HIPAA GDPR compliance - redact nothing, protect everything

HIPAA GDPR compliance - redact nothing, protect everything

Until now, HIPAA compliance has involved data removal of 18 identifiers and an expert opinion that the statistical or scientific principles used result in a low chance of identification.

With TripleBlind, data is legally de-identified in real time with practically 0% probability of re-identification,

TripleBlind's mathematical breakthrough in cryptography allows analytics on data containing PII and PHI with zero possibility for data privacy violations.

Gain insights from meaningful data, save time and resources from being spent on data removal and expert opinions, and ensure data privacy with technology.

Compliance can be difficult, time consuming, and expensive.
TripleBlind makes complying with HIPAA, GDPR, and data residency laws easy, instantaneous, and inexpensive.

## Slide 13: Industry: Healthcare - Clinical Trials - Early Indication Reporting

Industry: Healthcare - Clinical Trials
Early Indication Reporting

**SUMMARY OF PAIN POINT**
Clinical trials suffer from the following issues:
*   No Real-Time data analysis
*   Blinded studies, in general, prohibit interim analysis
*   Global trials are subject to different privacy laws
*   Expensive and time consuming to move and combine data in a centralized location for continuous real-time analysis before study completion
*   Could miss critical pieces of information if granular patient-level data is not part of the aggregation process
*   Data needs to be de-identified before publications/analysis

**DATA OWNER**
CROs and Research Co.

**DATA USERS**
Research Co.

**TYPE OF DATA**
Patient health data, clinical trial data

**SUMMARY OF SOLUTION**
The "Lot Control Numbers" can be matched privately ("blindly"), and placebo/real attribute can be joined to efficacy attributes.

"Blinding" is never compromised, aggregated data can be used for early indication reporting.

Attributes returned are controlled, query is "permitted" beforehand, and audit trails are created.

Efficacy reporting is available during study progression.

**Diagram Description:**
Three **CROs** (each with attributes A, B, C, D) provide data to a **Research Company** (with attributes A, X, Y, Z and Attribute A, B, C, D, X, Y, Z) via **TRIPLEBLIND INFRASTRUCTURE**. An **Efficacy Report** is generated.

## Slide 14: Industry: Healthcare, Financial Services, Marketing, Insurance - Patient Overlap (Data Augmentation)

Industry: Healthcare, Financial Services, Marketing, Insurance
Patient Overlap (Data Augmentation)

**SUMMARY OF PAIN POINT**
Access to more and diverse data leads to better modeling and analysis, but combining PHI and PII is a privacy nightmare.

Synthetic data or other means of 'creating' more data points are no substitute for access to real-world, quality datasets.

**DATA OWNER**
Pharma/drug developers, banks, credit bureaus, hospitals

**DATA USERS**
AI/ML model developers

**TYPE OF DATA**
Clinical trial, transaction, social media/web usage

**RESULTS EXPECTED**
PII can be matched privately ("blindly”), and used to create a 'super set' of attributes (i.e. equivalent to an SQL Join)

Aggregated data can be used for analysis, model building, etc.

Attributes returned are controlled, query is "permitted" beforehand, and audit trails are created

Applications – a) Marketing, b) Clinical Trial Reporting, c) Fraud Prevention

Aggregated dataset can be used for any type of analysis, from model training to queries.

**Diagram Description:**
Multiple **Data Sources** (with attributes A, B, C, D; A, E, F, G; and A, H, I, J) provide data to a **Client Company** (with attributes A, X, Y, Z and Attribute A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, X, Y, Z) via **TRIPLEBLIND INFRASTRUCTURE**. A **Combined Report/Analysis** is generated.

## Slide 15: Industry: Healthcare, Financial Services - Multimodal AI

Industry: Healthcare, Financial Services
Multimodal AI

**EXAMPLE CUSTOMER**
Mayo Clinic

**DATA OWNER**
Hospitals, diagnostics centers, pharma / clinical trials

**DATA USERS**
Hospitals, diagnostics

**SUMMARY OF PAIN POINT**
More predictive and generalizable AI models can be trained using multimodal data, or different data types use together in training.

Multimodal AI can be difficult without the right tools, and presents compliance difficulties, as de-identification and regulatory hurdles require a careful, educated, and often expensive approach.

**TYPE OF DATA**
Any image, text, tabular, voice, video, or sound data

**RESULTS EXPECTED**
TripleBlind eliminates the barriers to multimodal AI by offering an easy-to-use set of Blind AI Tools.

All types of data can be combined to train a model, while retaining compliance with all regulations, simultaneously and mathematically.

**Diagram Description:**
The "AI DIAGNOSTICS DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH CENTER" process involves:
*   **Outside Sources** (Hospital, Diagnostic Center, Nursing Home) providing data to **TripleBlind Private AI Infrastructure**.
*   Within the infrastructure, data flows through **Aggregated Data**, **Model Training**, **Model Validation**, and results in a **Trained Model**.
*   The trained model is then used by a **Partner Company**.

## Slide 16: Industry: Healthcare, Finance - Rapid Global AI Development

Industry: Healthcare, Finance
Rapid Global AI Development

**EXAMPLE CUSTOMER**
Mayo Clinic

**DATA OWNER**
Hospitals or other data owners

**DATA USERS**
AI/ML model developers

**SUMMARY OF PAIN POINT**
AI and ML require sourcing diverse data, which is not always available. Once found, it can be impossible to use due to privacy regulations that silo it in place.

Current approaches like federated learning for remotely training AI algorithms on distributed data require the entire model to be shipped to each data owner, exposing IP.

**TYPE OF DATA**
Any health data - X-ray images, EKGs, EHRs, etc.

**RESULTS EXPECTED**
Using Blind Learning, "Objects" can be shared with multiple counterparties in one integration (technical and contractual).

Counterparties never receive PII - no PII is exposed. And no manual de-identification is needed.

Each interaction enforces the appropriate privacy regulation (GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, Data Residency, etc.)

Data owners keep their data in place, while the model owner never ships the full model to anyone and receives a fully trained AI model.

**Diagram Description:**
**WITH TRIPLEBLIND INFRASTRUCTURE:**
**Vendor A**, **Vendor B**, and **Vendor C** provide data via **TRIPLEBLIND INFRASTRUCTURE** to separate **Data** and **Algorithms** components.

## Slide 17: Industry: Healthcare - Diagnostics Remote Delivery

Industry: Healthcare
Diagnostics Remote Delivery

**SUMMARY OF PAIN POINT**
Hospitals and others who have developed highly advanced diagnostics algorithms miss out on additional revenue streams from licensing their AI algorithms - sending models to clients is too risky and susceptible to reverse engineering.

**DATA OWNER**
Healthcare Diagnostics Centers

**DATA USERS**
Hospitals

**TYPE OF DATA**
Healthcare data (X-ray, genomic, EHRs, EKGs)

**RESULTS EXPECTED**
With TripleBlind's algorithm one way encryption for models in use, the world's best diagnostic algorithms can be put to use for remote diagnostics without exposing valuable IP, while preserving HIPAA compliance.

Algorithms operate on encrypted & de-identified data — HIPAA compliance for free.

Faster, more accurate
Companies license their algorithms to perform faster diagnoses on real patient data.

Intellectual Property Protection Built In

**Diagram Description:**
**Healthcare Centers Anywhere in the World**
A **Hospital** (Highly Advanced Diagnostic Algorithm) provides a **Transformed Algorithm**.
A **Diagnostic Center** provides **Transformed X-Ray Data**.
Both flow through a **Diagnosis** process to yield results.
The solution aims to Deliver "Deep Medicine” globally and Utilize highest granularity data.
