### Product Overview

- $1,000 PMPM (Per Member Per Month) pricing model
- Only one plan “Rivendell One” with full transparency
- Components:
	- High-deductible health plan (HDHP) for HSA compliance
	- Cash pay based catastrophic coverage with no deductible for ED visits
	- Quarterly blood panels pre-paid for customers
	- $400/month flexible spending for medical expenses (Oura ring, Eight Sleep, dental, contacts)
	- In-house clinician to validate health experiments and journeys
	- Copy of all health records provided

### Insurance Model

- Cash pay rates for all services
- Costs average 150% of Medicare rates (50% lower than commercial insurance)
- HDHP network only activated for catastrophic cases
- Can choose from multiple HDHP providers (Mutual of Omaha, Excelis, Empire, SelectMed)
- Plan to create bespoke product after reaching 1,000 members
- No provider network needed since members are cash pay
- Care navigation provided to find specialists and negotiate cash rates

### Business Model & Economics

- $1k monthly per member
- Keep 10% as admin fee (vs 20% for standard insurers)
- $100 PMPM revenue per company, scaling linearly
- Initial strategy:
	- White labeling services for quick market entry
	- Blood panels white labeled through LabCorp or Quest
	- Plan to negotiate direct contracts at scale
- Break even projected at 100-800 lives
- Target: 1,000 lives ($10M ARR) before Series A

### Go-to-Market Strategy

- Initial focus: Direct sales to longevity-focused customers
- Target early adopters already spending on preventative care
- Two key customer segments identified:
	- Founders/employees interested in longevity
	- Small business owners seeking better care for high-wage employees
- Partnership with NY payroll provider focusing on <25 employee companies
- Raising $3M to reach 1,000 underwritten lives

### Customer Experience

- Most potential customers unaware of current insurance costs
- Limited healthcare system interaction due to cash pay for preventative care
- More engaged customers typically had negative healthcare experiences
- Focus on transparency and control over health journey
- Rising interest in longevity post-COVID
- Target: People wanting “5% of Brian Johnson” approach to health optimization
