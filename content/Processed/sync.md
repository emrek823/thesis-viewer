### Contract Structure & Revenue Recognition

- Company’s contract representation needs clarification
	- Not true ARR - current run rate with percentage recurring
	- Almost 100% expected to become recurring after initial phase
	- MSA closures are the critical bottleneck
- Revenue number is $1.5M actual vs. $2.3M initially represented
	- Additional $900K-$1M in run rate could sign within 2-3 weeks
	- Tight execution: 2-3 weeks from signature to go-live and revenue recognition
- Strong supporting evidence despite lower numbers
	- Multiple contracts across different organizations
	- Demonstrated expansion from initial deployments
	- Customer testimonial video with 5-6 customers expressing strong validation

### Fundraising Strategy & Timeline

- Tiered approach for investor meetings
	- Start with 5-7 Tier 2/3 investors for pitch practice
	- Then move to 10-15 higher-tier firms including Sequoia
	- Target ~20 total meetings to build relationships for future rounds
- Launch timing: Wednesday latest for initial outreach
	- Schedule first meetings for next week
	- Don’t lead with best/tier-one investors initially
- Market timing advantages
	- Multiple firms actively targeting this healthcare AI space
	- Strong customer testimonials and market validation

### Investor Mapping & Introductions

- Tier 1 targets identified:
	- Sequoia: Constantine (AI focus) + ecosystem partner, emphasize market size
	- Kleiner: Annie (has been asking about company) + Mamoon
	- Andreessen: Jay (healthcare/Flatiron background)
- Sean’s connections: Signal Fire (Amaray), ABC (Sebastian), NEA (Blake), Thrive (Kareem)
- Byron’s connections: Graylock (Christine), Madrona, Index (Martin), First Round
- Practice tier: TCV, Headline, FPV for additional pitch refinement

### Founder Readiness Assessment

- Eris (technical founder) showing improvement in pitch delivery
	- Not naturally suave but has been coaching himself effectively
	- Strong technical knowledge comes through in unscripted conversations
	- Needs practice rounds before engaging top-tier firms
- Limited prior investor interaction experience
	- Risk of getting caught off-guard by unexpected questions
	- One shot with firms like Sequoia - need to be prepared
- Customer validation strength will help carry conversations with interested firms
