### Team Backgrounds & FlashCare Vision

- Fan: 8 years at Google, PhD in NLP/CS
	- First 3 years in Google Ads (LP research → billion-user products)
	- 5 years in Google Health as tech lead
	- Led Care Studio launch (AI-driven EHR system)
	- Developed healthcare-specific LLMs including Magma and TX Jammer
	- Currently working on AI doctor AMIE and patient-facing agent BeMAx
- Jackie: Information systems background, 5 years Deloitte healthcare tech consulting
	- Wharton MBA, joined Google Health AI team with Fan (3 years)
	- Worked on Medicaid accessibility, ACA insurance portals
- Core insight: Healthcare orgs not incentivized to optimize workflows/patient experience
	- Need to own end-to-end workflow vs. point solutions
	- AI scribes being absorbed by Epic’s own tooling
	- Patients can’t access coordinated care tools that impact bottom line

### Technical Approach & Current AI Limitations

- AI models improving but key gaps remain:
	- Papers show fixed vignettes with complete patient info
	- Real-world requires probing information from patients through conversational flow
	- Generative models inherently make mistakes (autoregressive nature)
	- Human-in-the-loop still required for medical decisions
- Goal: Significantly reduce doctor time per case while maintaining quality
	- Efficiency improvements enable $5 visit economics
	- Combination of AI + human oversight + workflow innovations
- Medical superintelligence imminent for primary care use cases
	- Telehealth natural fit (cases already handled without physical exam)
	- Models will handle more case types as remote monitoring improves

### Go-to-Market Strategy & Business Model

- Target underserved populations vs. typical telehealth users (urban/wealthy/educated):
	- Limited English Proficiency (Spanish/Mandarin speakers)
	- Rural areas with primary care access issues
	- Gen Z preferring asynchronous messaging over phone/in-person
- Service offering: $5 visits with video + messaging options
	- Pre-visit symptom checker as entry point
	- Willing to go to $0 pricing as loss leader
- Revenue model: Clinical research partnerships
	- Target 20K-100K patient datasets for pharma/CRO partnerships
	- Research revenue funds low-cost patient care
	- Focus on disenfranchised populations creates valuable, hard-to-access datasets
- Key metrics to prove:
	- Reduce time per visit without quality loss
	- Refine research partnership approach for specific trial pain points

### Next Steps

- Virtue VC process: Second 60-minute call if mutual interest
	- Sean (partner) returns from paternity leave Monday
	- 7-10 day decision timeline with reference calls
- FlashCare has working prototype available for demo
- Emre will provide feedback early next week on moving forward
