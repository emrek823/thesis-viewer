## The Laws of Economics Necessitate Change in the Health Economy

The inputs of the U.S. healthcare system vastly exceed its outputs, as measured by the health of the American public. And yet, over the next 10 years, health expenditures are expected to continue to grow faster than the rest of the economy, projected to reach 20.3% of GDP, or $24,200 per person, by 2033. The current trajectory of the U.S. healthcare system, one which increasingly depletes societal wealth without generating commensurate health gains, is unsustainable for patients, payers, employers, and providers alike. The fact that the health economy continues to defy the laws of economics confirms that it is not a free market.

This fifth installment of the Trends Shaping the Health Economy Report provides insight into six data-driven trends that are either intensifying or emerging. The Transparency in Coverage initiative promulgated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services makes obvious that the U.S. health economy finds itself at a crossroads; the choice for health economy stakeholders is whether to implement radical and transformational change from the inside or whether to be subjected to such change by external forces, namely Federal and state government. Said differently, the question for health economy stakeholders is this: do you want to make it happen or have it happen to you?

In either scenario, every health economy stakeholder will be required to deliver demonstrable value for money, rather than perpetuating inefficiencies that compound systemic waste. To do so, stakeholders must be willing to reassess the very foundation of the U.S. healthcare system. Rather than thinking about what already exists, the fundamental question is this: what is essential?

This report does not claim to provide all the answers, but it offers a framework for asking the right questions. What trends have you not considered, and how will they impact the markets that your organization serves? What changes must your organization make to deliver more value for money relative to your current and future competitors? What changes are necessary for your organization to compete effectively in a system that can no longer sustain the status quo?

## The U.S. Cannot Afford Its Healthcare System

In 2023, U.S. healthcare spending reached $4.9T, or $14,570 per person, representing 17.6% of the nation’s GDP. Employers underwrite the largest share of that spending, accounting for nearly $1.4T, or 30.0% of total NHE. How long can the U.S. allocate more than $1T each to Medicare, Medicaid and interest on the Federal debt?

## The Most Expensive 10% of Patients Account for Two-Thirds of Spending

U.S. healthcare spending follows the Pareto Principle, also known as the 80/20 rule, in which a small proportion of patients are responsible for the majority of spending. Specifically, the most expensive 5% of the population is responsible for 49.7% of spending, while the least expensive 50% only accounts for 2.8% of spending, or $374 per person.

## The U.S. Healthcare System Delivers Poor Comparative Value

In economics, value is a measure of the benefit provided by a good or service to an economic agent. By definition, spending more on healthcare with worse results is emblematic of poor value. Based on the comparative value of healthcare systems in peer countries and the comparative effect of medical and non-medical factors on overall health, the reasonable person must question the level of investment in the U.S. healthcare system.

## The Performance of the U.S. Healthcare System Is a Function of Its “Design”

The U.S. healthcare system is peerless in its financial, administrative and regulatory complexity, characterized by a byzantine web of stakeholders that make the system inscrutable to the average American. Although the performance of the U.S. healthcare system has long been suboptimal, current macroeconomic conditions dictate a redesign.

## Demanding Value and Returning to First Principles

The U.S. healthcare system is at a crossroads. National health expenditures have increased from $2.8T in 2012 to $4.9T in 2023 despite relatively little change in demand or utilization. In 2023, healthcare spending accounted for 17.6% of GDP and is expected to reach 20.3% by 2033. Underwritten by the Federal government, state Medicaid programs, employers and the American public, the U.S. health economy is the most expensive healthcare system in the world. Is the U.S. healthcare system worth what we spend on it? Probably not.

Average American life expectancy is only negligibly higher than it was in 2000, has declined since 2019 and is almost four years lower than many peer OECD countries. Compared to those same peer nations, the U.S. also has higher rates of chronic disease, infant mortality, maternal mortality and avoidable mortality.

The reputation of the U.S. healthcare system often precedes itself – it is expensive, complex and inefficient. Understanding why begins with the recognition that, regardless of tax status, the “system” is a collection of profit-seeking businesses treating illness – “no margin, no mission” – rather than a thoughtful and comprehensive approach to promoting health. As a result, the U.S. healthcare system ends up providing poor care to many Americans. Additionally, the staggering $4.9T that is invested into the healthcare “system” crowds out other social investment that might contribute to improved wellbeing.

In economics, value is a measure of the benefit provided by a good or service to an economic agent. For consumer goods, value is ultimately subjective but is shaped by price, quality and convenience. In plain terms, the U.S. healthcare system does not provide good value to patients or society. With the national debt exceeding $35T (or 120% of GDP), the U.S. cannot afford to spend 20% of its GDP on a healthcare system that does not provide demonstrable value for money. How has the U.S. health economy defied the laws of economics for so long?

What is the core goal of a healthcare system? Does spending more on healthcare mean better health? When is health insurance useful? Do hospitals need to be the central hub of clinical care? Should employers be the main source of healthcare coverage? Should society underwrite the cost of poor health that is attributable to poor lifestyle behaviors or instead promote health and incentivize healthy lifestyles? Rather than thinking about what already exists, what is essential?

## Analysis of Demand, Supply and Yield Reveals Six Key Trends

This report provides a data-driven analysis of six trends that will define the landscape, and subsequent challenges, that will impact every health economy stakeholder. The original research findings featured in this annual series are gleaned from proprietary Trilliant Health datasets and analytic models that measure various dimensions of demand, supply and yield across the health economy. To study healthcare demand, (i.e., utilization), we leveraged our national all-payer medical and pharmacy claims database. The Trilliant Health Provider Directory was used to study the supply of 5.2M providers, allied health professionals and organizations. The intersection of supply and demand informs expected yield. To measure yield, we leveraged our health plan price transparency dataset, which provides negotiated rate data across large national and small regional health plans. These data components allow for the triangulation of what service was provided, where the service was provided, who provided the service and how much the service cost. In addition to the primary data analyses conducted using Trilliant Health assets, the report includes other publicly available information (e.g., financial statements) and secondary sources (e.g., American Hospital Association, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention).

Demand refers to both the exogenous and endogenous factors that influence consumer preferences for, need for and utilization of healthcare services. Supply refers to the various providers of health services ranging from hospitals and physician practices to retail pharmacies, new entrants and virtual care platforms. Yield refers to the intersection of demand and supply (i.e., price) and is also influenced by market factors such as policy regulations and reimbursement incentives.

## ICHRAs Aim to Increase Choice and Lower Employer Costs

ICHRAs are a type of employer-sponsored health benefit plan that allow employers to provide tax-exempt allowances for employees to purchase individual health insurance. As individual and employer health insurance costs continue to grow, ICHRAs provide an alternative approach for employer-sponsored insurance, primarily among small employers. To date, ICHRA adoption remains limited – offered to roughly 200,000 employer-sponsored individuals in 2025 – and their impact on health and spending remains to be seen.

## The Financial Burden of Medical Care Is Detrimental to Health Outcomes

Financial toxicity – the negative impact of medical costs on a patient’s financial wellbeing – disproportionately impacts patients with serious illnesses, such as heart disease or cancer. In 2021, 15% of American households owed medical debt. One study found that a one percentage point increase in the population with medical debt was associated with 18.3 more physically unhealthy days per 1,000 people. Additionally, higher-income adults in poor health are more likely to report medical debt than lower-income adults in good health.

## Limited Grocery Access Aligns With Fast Food Concentration

The U.S. has over 9,200 low-income Census tracts that lack access to grocery stores but contain more than 271,000 limited-service restaurants. Over 80% of all limited-service restaurants nationwide are located in the 66.3% of counties with at least one limited grocery access area.

### Number of Limited-Service Restaurants, by County, 2023

**Note:** Limited access areas reflect 2019 low-income Census tracts (poverty rate ≥ 20% or median family income ≤ 80% of state or metro median) where at least 500 people or 33% of residents live more than one mile (urban) or 10 miles (rural) from the nearest grocery store. Limited-service restaurants are establishments where customers order and pay before eating, including fast food, pizza delivery, takeout, and fast casual.

## L&#x26;D Closures Exemplify Tension Between Demand, Access and Specialization

As health systems continue to compete for a shrinking number of births, an increasing number have shuttered their L&#x26;D units altogether, with many citing the declining rate of patients. Through the first half of 2025, at least 17 health systems had announced unit closures. This trend is acute in rural areas, where fewer than 42% of rural hospitals still offer L&#x26;D services.

## MA Enrollment Accelerates as Employer-Sponsored Insurance Remains Flat

Commercially insured Americans have traditionally accounted for the majority of profitable revenue across the health economy. However, the employer-sponsored share of the population is flat to declining, remaining unchanged from 2023 to 2024. While the number and share of Medicare beneficiaries increases, enrollment is growing disproportionately in Medicare Advantage, which is projected to account for 64% of Medicare beneficiaries by 2034.

## Pay Disparities Reveal the Perceived Value of Primary Care

Despite its central role in prevention and chronic disease management, primary care compensation remains well below specialty physicians. In 2024, primary care physicians earned an average of $303,435, close to half the average of specialist physicians ($593,697). As new physicians graduate with an average of $194,280 in debt and enter residency earning approximately $60,000, it is unsurprising that many are drawn to higher-paying specialties.

## Most Retailers Have Exited Primary Care in Favor of Specialty Pharmacy

As of 2025, major retailers have either exited or reduced their direct primary care operations. In contrast, each organization has maintained or expanded its presence in specialty pharmacy, where capabilities in distribution and integration with existing care delivery assets have warranted continued investment.

| Retailer   | Primary Care Entry | Initial Primary Care Strategy | Evolved Primary Care Strategy | Primary Care Status | Specialty Pharmacy Strategy |
|------------|--------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------|
| CVS        | 2014 (MinuteClinic expansion), 2021 (Acquisition of Oak Street Health) | Acquired Oak Street Health for $10.6B to operate value-based senior primary care clinics combined with existing MinuteClinic and Aetna Medicare Advantage. | Slowed expansion of Oak Street clinics; some closures reported; facing profitability and integration challenges. | Active, but scaling back | Aggressively expanding specialty pharmacy via Caremark and Cordavis. |
| Walgreens  | 2021 (Major investment in VillageMD) | Invested $6B for majority stake in VillageMD to co-locate full-service primary care clinics in stores. | Announced in early 2024 that it would close ~160 VillageMD clinics and sell majority stake amid $5B writedown. | Exit | Focused on specialty growth via Shields Health Solutions (acquired 2022). |
| Amazon     | 2019 (Amazon Care), 2022 (Acquisition of One Medical) | Launched Amazon Care; later acquired One Medical for $3.9B to scale hybrid primary care. | Shut down Amazon Care in 2022. One Medical still operating but experiencing slow growth and unclear integration with Amazon Prime. | Pivoted | Entered specialty pharmacy in 2023 via Amazon Pharmacy, now expanding offerings to include specialty medications. |
| Walmart    | 2019 (Walmart Health centers) | Built de novo primary care clinics offering low-cost care near stores, targeting self-pay and Medicare Advantage patients. | In 2024, announced exit from 51 health centers and halted further expansion, citing unsustainable costs. | Exit | Exploring partnerships and payer collaborations in specialty. No standalone specialty pharmacy brand, but strong retail pharmacy infrastructure could support future entry. |

> “The decision to close all 51 health centers across five states and shut down the virtual care offering was not easy. While we will no longer operate health centers, we will take what we learned as we provide trusted health and wellness services across the country through our nearly 4,600 Pharmacies...Over the past few years, the importance of Pharmacies has continued to grow, and we have expanded the clinical capabilities of the services we provide. We continue to offer immunizations and have grown to provide Testing and Treatment services, access to specialty pharmacy medication and care, as well as other essential services such as medication therapy management and a variety of health screenings.” – Walmart press release

## Behavioral Health Demand Is Rising, but Access Remains a Challenge

Nearly one in five U.S. adults report anxiety or depression, but only 13.4% receive therapy, up from 9.5% in 2019. Reported barriers to behavioral health care include high costs (80%), lack of insurance coverage (74%) and inadequate provider supply (63%). The USPSTF recommends depression screening for adolescents ages 12-18 using the same standardized questions as adults, while anxiety screenings begin as early as age eight with tools simplified for children.

## Emerging Chronic Conditions Signal a General Sense of Unwellness

Between 2021 and 2024, most emerging chronic conditions increased in prevalence, with the largest relative growth observed in long COVID (68.0%), obstructive sleep apnea (46.3%) and NAFLD/NASH (27.0%). In 2023, a formal ICD-10 diagnosis was established for POTS, which resulted in a 34.0% increase from 2023 to 2024. These trends suggest shifting clinical attention and diagnostic activity toward certain metabolic, respiratory and post-viral conditions.

## Nearly Half of All Cancer Diagnoses Occur at a Late Stage

Despite the clear correlation between early diagnosis and survival, nearly half of all cancer cases are diagnosed at a late stage, which remained relatively unchanged from 2017 to 2021. Even among screenable cancers, the share of cancer cases diagnosed at a late stage ranges from 24% for prostate cancer to 69% for lung cancer.

### Share of Cancer Cases Diagnosed at a Late Stage, by Cancer Type, 2017 and 2021

## More Urban Hospitals Are Claiming Rural Status

The share of hospital beds classified as “administratively rural” grew from 13% to 45% between 2013 and 2023, driven by the dual classification of many urban hospitals. This expansion allows large metropolitan facilities to access rural-focused subsidies and programs like 340B under lower thresholds than those applied to urban hospitals.

## Duplicate Insurance Coverage Drives Billions in Excess Spending

In 2024, 2.8M people were enrolled in more than one Medicaid and/or ACA exchange plan, resulting in at least $4.3B in duplicate payments. In the same year, nearly 8M ACA exchange enrollees (37%) did not have a medical claim. Relatedly, dual enrollment between VHA and MA coverage increased by 62.9% from 2011 to 2020. For dual enrollees, MA plans still receive full capitated payments, which corresponds to duplicate Federal payment for the care of the same beneficiaries.

## PBMs Add Complexity to the Drug Distribution and Pricing Process

PBMs negotiate rebates and discounts from manufacturers, design drug formularies and oversee pharmacy networks and claims processing on behalf of payers. The three largest PBMs, which fill nearly 80% of prescriptions, are vertically integrated with insurers and pharmacies. While theoretically positioned to help control drug spending, undisclosed financial incentives have the opposite effect. For consumers, actual savings are unpredictable, variable and situational.

### PBM Overview

## Misaligned Incentives Continue to Hinder Biosimilar and Generic Savings

Between 2014 and 2023, generics and biosimilars generated **$3.1T** in savings. Despite these savings, biosimilars are dispensed just **19.2%** of the time when available. Across leading biologics, ASP fell by **1% to 95%** after the launch of a biosimilar, though market share ranged from **27% to 88%** as of Q3 2024.

## Over 75% of FDA-Approved Drugs Are Not Recommended by NICE

Despite costing 56.1% less in the U.K. than the U.S., NICE has determined that many FDA-approved drugs do not meet the necessary clinical and cost-effectiveness thresholds required for coverage by the NHS.

## Value for Money Remains Elusive for Many Specialty Therapies
Specialty drugs consistently launch above their health benefit price benchmarks, the range ICER deems cost-effective. Cost per QALY is also typically above these thresholds, ranging from $127K (Libmeldy®) to $2.3M (Winrevair®). Few remain affordable beyond 20% uptake – while Rezdiffra® demonstrates value within benchmark, it impacts budgets at just 6.5% uptake, and Tab-cel® and Rytelo® scale to nearly all patients but exceed $150K per QALY.

## The Cycle of Innovation Influences Rate of Care Migration Outside the Hospital

New treatment paradigms are frequently introduced in the hospital setting, then migrate to less intensive and expensive outpatient settings over time. Historically, novel complex therapies (e.g., CAR-T) replace the lost inpatient care and start a new cycle of innovation.

## Inpatient Surgical Volume Is Threatened by the Proposed IPO List Removal

In July 2025, CMS proposed to eliminate the Medicare IPO list over the next three years, beginning with 285 mostly musculoskeletal procedures. After TKAs were removed from the IPO list in 2018, inpatient volume declined by 17.9% from 2017 to 2018, with 2024 inpatient TKA volume 85.4% below 2017. Similarly, inpatient volume for THA declined by 35.8% in the year following its removal, with 2024 inpatient THA volume 66.1% below 2019.

## Outpatient Migration Will Shift Revenue to ASCs and Reduce Spending

In July 2025, CMS proposed to eliminate the Medicare IPO list. Lumbar spinal fusion (CPT 22558) is among the proposed procedures that would also be moved to the ASC CPL. When 100% of Medicare lumbar spinal fusions are inpatient, spending totals $1.1B. However, if 50% of lumbar spinal fusions were performed in HOPDs and 50% in ASCs, expenditures would total $760.2M, a net reduction of $359.8M.

### Potential Scenarios for Medicare Inpatient vs. Outpatient Lumbar Spinal Fusion

**Note:** ASC denotes ambulatory surgery center; CMS denotes Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services; CPL denotes Covered Procedures List; HOPD denotes hospital outpatient department; IPO denotes Inpatient Only list. CPT 22558 denotes arthrodesis, anterior interbody technique, including minimal discectomy to prepare interspace (other than for decompression); lumbar. Because CPT 22558 is currently designated as an inpatient-only procedure, no outpatient Medicare rates exist. To approximate outpatient payment levels, ratios of inpatient-to-HOPD-to-ASC rates from other comparable procedures were applied.

## Patient Travel Depends on Procedure Complexity and Access to Care

For ongoing chronic condition management, 44.4% of dialysis care occurs within five miles of a patient’s home, compared to 28.3% for craniotomy, 29.5% for joint replacement and 35.5% for TAVR/TMVR. From 2018 to 2024, the proportion of surgeries performed more than 50 miles from a patient’s home declined by 6.3 PP, compared to a 2.2 PP increase in dialysis. The increased travel for dialysis care could be explained by facility closures, while reduced travel for surgical care could be an indicator of broader accessibility.

## Rural Care Access Is Shrinking as Hospitals Close and Cut Inpatient Services

Since 2015, 109 rural hospitals have closed, and since 2023, 40 more have shifted to emergency-only care. Currently, 314 rural hospitals remain at immediate risk of closure, while another 760 are financially vulnerable. Despite low demand and limited reimbursement, many remain open as the sole care provider and as a critical anchor to the local economy.

## Telehealth Utilization Continues To Decline

Since 2020, telehealth volume has declined by 32.2%, down 52.0% for non-behavioral virtual care. Telehealth for the treatment and management of behavioral health conditions has emerged as a viable substitute for in-person care but declined from 70.5% of all telehealth volume in 2023 to 66.9% in 2024.

## Most Patients Receive In-Person Care Exclusively

Across age groups, most patients consistently pursue in-person only healthcare. While hybrid care peaked amid the COVID-19 pandemic, it has declined but stabilized at over 25% for patients ages 18-44 and is lowest among children. Across adult age groups, women are more likely to pursue hybrid care than men.

## Surgical Procedures May Be Imperiled by Novel Drugs

As new therapies enter the market, the prevailing procedure-based approach to care will change. Between 2018 and 2023, GLP-1 patients increased by 744.6%, while bariatric surgery volume was flat to declining. During the same period, SGLT2 inhibitor patients grew by 231.7% as cardiac catheterization volume declined by 14.4%. However, in both clinical use cases, a small patient cohort was prescribed medications both before and after surgery, calling into question the extent to which these medications serve as replacements versus supplements to surgery.

### Percent Change in GLP-1 and Bariatric Surgery Patient Volume, Compared to 2018, 2018-2023

Note: The odds ratio compares the odds of one segment of a sociodemographic group having a different level of trust in physicians and hospitals compared to a baseline (i.e., patient segment with an odds ratio equal to 1.0). Segments with lower odds ratios (i.e., below 1.0) were less likely to trust physicians and hospitals. Sociodemographic group segments with higher odds ratios (i.e., above 1.0) were more likely to trust physicians and hospitals.

## Employer Strategies to Contain Healthcare Costs Are Ineffective

Employer strategies to control healthcare costs have focused on increasing patient cost sharing via coinsurance, copays and deductibles. Not only has increased cost-sharing failed to meaningfully reduce overall healthcare spending, but it is associated with reductions in use of both low-value and high-value care. Despite this knowledge, employers remain focused on increasing premium contributions, moving to HDHPs and implementing wellness programs.

## Employers and Patients Pay the Price When Insurance Companies Falter

Until the end of 2024, the stock performance of major health insurance companies had consistently grown since 2010. While most have attributed their declining financial performance to higher-than-anticipated care utilization, a closer examination of revenue sources reveals more nuanced dynamics. As publicly traded insurance companies respond to market pressures, patients and employers will bear the brunt of the consequences through higher premiums and utilization management.

## Price and Quality for Common Services Are Not Correlated

While the median negotiated rate for MS-DRG 193 in Miami is $22,255, the provider receiving the highest rate has the sixth-highest mortality rate out of the 15 hospitals. Additionally, for these four common MS-DRGs, the correlation coefficient ranges from -0.37 (COPD) to 0.55 (pneumonia), reflective of a lack of a consistent correlation between price and quality.

Most Government Interventions Have Not Contained Healthcare Spending

Since the 1980s, policymakers have pursued policies to improve affordability, quality and consumer choice. However, national health expenditures have increased from $2.8T in 2012 to $4.9T in 2023 and are expected to reach $8.6T, or 20.3% of GDP, by 2033.

## APMs Are Expensive and Tend To Generate Net Losses

In contrast to fee-for-service reimbursement, APMs are intended to reward quality and value rather than volume of services. Despite the intended goals, CMMI has generated an estimated $5.4B in losses from APMs launched between 2012 and 2025.

## MSSP Savings Are Totally Eclipsed by Total Medicare Spending

In 2024, ACOs in the Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP) generated $2.4B in Medicare savings, equivalent to $241 per capita. Yet with per-enrollee Medicare spending at $15,808 in 2023 and total Medicare spending exceeding $1T, those savings amount to less than 1% of overall program costs.

## CBO Believes That Healthcare Prices Respond Most to Price Controls

While transparency and competition are already core themes of previous reform efforts, government-mandated caps on commercial prices would fundamentally reshape stakeholder economics, particularly for employer-sponsored health plans, which cover more than 60% of Americans under age 65. If rates in all private plans are capped at 200% of Medicare, the average hospital price paid by private plans would decrease by 7.6%.

In 1983, the Introduction of DRGs Slowed Spending Growth
The introduction of Medicare’s prospective payment system using Diagnosis-Related Groups (DRGs) in 1983 fundamentally changed hospital reimbursement, shifting payments from a cost-based approach to a fixed, episode-based model. Following the policy’s implementation, the rate of Medicare hospital spending growth slowed relative to national per capita spending and hospital margins declined.

In 1997, the BBA Strained Hospital Financial Performance

The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 substantially reduced Medicare payment rates for hospitals and other providers and slowed the growth of future increases, resulting in an uptick in the number of hospitals with a negative operating margin. Even so, since the BBA’s passage, hospital spending has increased 4x from $363B in 1997 to $1,520B in 2023.

## In 2026, the Mandatory TEAM Model Will Expand Upon DRGs

The Transforming Episode Accountability Model (TEAM) is a mandatory, episode-based APM developed by CMMI, which is projected to save Medicare $481M between 2026 and 2030. Unlike CMMI’s experimentation with voluntary VBC models that have failed to generate material savings, TEAM is a mandatory model that applies a bundled payment like a DRG, but over a longer period of time.

### CBSAs Required to Participate in TEAM, 2026

| MS-DRGs Subject to TEAM                          |
|--------------------------------------------------|
| Lower extremity joint replacement (MS-DRGs 469, 470, 521, 522) |
| Hip and femur fracture surgeries (MS-DRGs 480-482) |
| Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) (MS-DRGs 231-236) |
| Major bowel procedures (MS-DRGs 329-331)        |
| Spinal fusion (MS-DRGs 402, 426-430, 447-448, 450-451, 471-473) |

## States Are a Harbinger of Federal Price Control Legislation

In 2025, 13 states considered legislation that would establish reference-based pricing requirements, with Indiana, Washington and Vermont enacting laws as of September 2025. After considering similar legislation in 2023, the Indiana General Assembly enacted HB 1004 in May 2025, which establishes a study of commercial hospital prices to inform future inpatient and outpatient hospital price caps for nonprofit hospitals.

### States Considering Reference-Based Pricing Legislation, 2025

| State      | Summary of Enacted Reference-Based Pricing Provisions                                                                 |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Indiana    | Requires nonprofit health systems to submit financial disclosures and audited statements, requires the state to study commercial hospital prices, which will inform a price cap for nonprofit hospitals. |
| Vermont    | Implements hospital reference-based pricing by setting prices as a percentage of Medicare.                           |
| Washington | Sets a Medicare-based reimbursement limits for in- and out-of-network hospital services, with reporting, premium adjustments and impact studies. |

### Timeline of Price Cap Proposals in Indiana

- **2023:** Early iterations of HB 1004 (2023) included penalties for nonprofit hospitals that priced services above 260% of Medicare, but as the bill moved through the Senate, lawmakers replaced the 260% concept with a benchmarking study to calculate nonprofit hospital system prices as a percentage of Medicare and required a compilation of Medicaid reimbursement data.

- **2024:** Policy advocates urged the General Assembly to lower the 285% benchmark to 260% and add penalties, but that was not enacted.

- **2025:** HB 1004 (2025) requires nonprofit health systems to submit financial disclosures and audited statements and requires the state to study commercial hospital prices. Study results will inform a price cap that nonprofit must comply with following the conclusion of the study. Earlier versions of the bill would have capped commercial hospital prices at 200% of the Medicare reimbursement rate.

## Price Caps Are Imminent Unless the System Starts Delivering Value for Money

In 2025, the Indiana General Assembly passed a law that will implement commercial hospital price caps based on a study of hospital prices in the state, which will take effect no later than July 2029. In a scenario where the threshold is set at 260% of Medicare reimbursement, using coronary bypass with cardiac catheterization procedures as an example, reimbursement would decline by $51,900 per case, equivalent to $25.9M in lost revenue for a health system performing 500 procedures.

## How Might Price Controls Impact Health Economy Stakeholders?

A government may impose a price ceiling when it believes a good is essential for survival and that market prices are prohibitively high. In healthcare – a market that is far from perfect – such a ceiling would lower reimbursements for providers, which in turn would ultimately impact payers and life science companies, as well as stakeholders who are middlemen. All stakeholders need to anticipate and plan for the consequences of reduced revenue.

### Yield Implications of Capped Commercial Prices

| Impact of Reduced Yield, by Stakeholder | | | |
|------------------------------------------|---|---|---|
| **Price**                                | **Demand** | **Supply** | **Least Impacted** |
| Market Price                             | Patient Affordability | Payers (Commercial Insurers &#x26; Federal Government) | |
| Lost Reimbursement                       | Patient Experience | Life Sciences | Other Suppliers |
| **Price Ceiling**                       | **Quantity** | Hospitals, Health Systems &#x26; Physicians | **Most Impacted** |
| Potential Shortage                       |                                          |                                          | |

## The Health Economy Is at a Crossroads: Market Discipline or Structural Reform?


---


# CONCLUSION
## The Ongoing Healthcare “Doom Loop”

The U.S. healthcare system is caught in a doom loop of self-reinforcing dynamics that drives costs upward, health outcomes downward and makes reform increasingly difficult.

Healthcare spending continues to outpace inflation and wage growth even as employers, government and households face growing financial strain. Instead of innovation or transformation, payers respond with ever-increasing premiums and deductibles, while providers seek higher commercial rates to offset reimbursement pressures from government payers and patients delay or avoid care due to affordability concerns.

Having avoided preventive and primary care, patients often need more expensive and specialized care, creating enduring compensation gaps between specialists and primary care, which is perpetually underfunded and underutilized. Meanwhile, closed-loop EHR systems prevent meaningful use, reinforcing inefficiency and waste, and reform efforts stall or result in incremental fixes that add further complexity. Each stakeholder defends its revenue model, also known as maintaining the status quo.

The result: costs continue to rise, access worsens, health outcomes stagnate and resources are allocated inefficiently. Together, this exemplifies a negative-sum game in which all participants expend more and collectively gain less. The trajectory of healthcare reform hinges on whether change is pursued proactively from within the system or imposed externally through government intervention.

----

| Stakeholder | Dynamics |
|-------------|----------|
| Payer       | Increased premiums and deductibles |
| Provider    | Higher commercial rates |
| Patient     | Delayed or avoided care |
| System      | Underfunded primary care, increased specialty care |

# C O N C L U S I O N
## Breaking the U.S. Healthcare Doom Loop Requires First Principles Thinking

Improving the U.S. healthcare system requires someone to break the doom loop, and the key question is who will be the first to break the chain. The risk to every health economy stakeholder is that change will be imposed from the outside, primarily by Federal and state government. History suggests that government has only one effective tool in its healthcare reform toolbox: price controls, whether in the form of rate setting, bundled pricing or price caps.

Proactive reform requires stakeholders – providers, payers and life sciences companies – to embrace market discipline by competing transparently on price, quality and access, either because they recognize the merit of the strategy or because employers finally demand it. Said differently, health economy stakeholders must reorient their business models to deliver value for money. Waste is the most obvious obstacle to value for money in healthcare. Any activity in any enterprise that is not necessary creates waste, and this report demonstrates only a portion of the fraud, waste and abuse in the U.S. healthcare system.

The universal solution to waste is first principles thinking. In healthcare, first principles thinking requires stripping away all "common wisdom" and deconstructing the U.S. healthcare system to its atomic truths. The question about everything in healthcare is this: Is it necessary? At its core, the healthcare system is intended to connect patients with providers for medical care. What does that mean for everyone else - employers, private and public payers, life sciences, health IT vendors, PBMs, group purchasing organizations, lobbyists, consultancies and advisory firms?

Regina Herlizinger wrote 30 years ago, with hospitals focused on two or three service lines and life sciences companies focused on one or two disease states and claims adjudication performed completely electronically using a framework like SWIFT banking. Such dynamics could improve affordability and accountability without the need for heavy-handed regulation. However, as Upton Sinclair noted, “it is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends on his not understanding it.”

Because stakeholders have failed to initiate meaningful change in the past 30 years, unconstrained costs and persistent inequities have catalyzed mounting political pressure for more sweeping, government-directed structural reform, which may be less responsive to local variation and less efficient in its design. The critical question, then, is whether the health economy will undertake reforms that align incentives with value for money, or whether inaction will invite externally imposed solutions that redefine the system on less favorable terms. Do you want to make change happen, or do you want change to happen to you?

## Analytic Approach

A variety of data sources were leveraged as part of this research, with most insights gleaned from Trilliant Health’s proprietary datasets with visibility into patients, providers and negotiated rates across the country. Trilliant Health’s national all-payer claims database combines commercial, Medicare Advantage, Traditional Medicare and Medicaid claims, providing a nationally representative sample on a deidentified basis. Claims-based data analyses use data through Q4 2024. Trilliant Health’s Provider Directory enables a direct view into providers and their practice patterns, accounting for 5.2M providers, allied health professionals and organizations. The Trilliant Health health plan price transparency dataset is comprised of health plan machine-readable files that have been parsed and cleaned. Trilliant Health leverages its Provider Directory and claims data against the health plan price transparency dataset to reveal the negotiated reimbursement rate between any commercial health plan and any provider for any service rendered at any location.

Additional data were obtained from a variety of publicly available sources (and are noted in respective source notes), including individual health system, health plan and company financial statements, U.S. Census Bureau, KFF, the Congressional Budget Office, American Hospital Association, American Medical Association, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Healthcare Cost Report Information System and the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

This research does not include data from self-pay encounters or encounters provided at no cost through commercial insurers that do not generate a claim.

Most data are presented with a national view, while some were exclusively focused on counties or the largest markets – defined as the core-based statistical areas (CBSAs) – to illustrate local variation. Most analyses in the 2025 Trends Shaping the Health Economy Report are limited to the commercially insured population, which generates most of the health economy's revenue.
