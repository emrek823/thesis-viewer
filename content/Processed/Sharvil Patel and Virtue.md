### Current Business Metrics

- 6 true acquisitions completed
- 8 physicians total in network
- 15-16 providers across 5 locations
- RCM costs running at 1.25% of collections (vs Enter at 4%, Candid at 3%, Carbon EHR at 8%, Athena at 12%)

### Clinical Service Expansion

- Launched Virtual Pulmonary Rehab in last 6 months (similar to RPM logistics but different clinical services)
- Weight loss program for sleep apnea patients showing strong results
- Smoking cessation program was not successful (patients resistant until serious diagnosis)

### Operational Optimization

- Optimizing pre-visit data preparation to increase daily patient capacity from 18 to 22-24 patients
- Philippines team trained on physician idiosyncrasies to prep charts, hospital records, medications, and orders
- Rejected AI for pre-visit process due to:
	- Multiple failed attempts across various use cases
	- Integration challenges with Particle, Metriport, Native integration, Health Gorilla
	- Poor data access from local HIEs
	- Complexity of coordinating with imaging centers and hospitals

### AI Implementation Experience

- Tested multiple voice AI vendors for patient communication:
	- Clarion beat human agents by 10% at half the cost
	- Clarion outperformed Parakeet by 20% (50% vs 72-73% completion rate)
	- Ran randomized trial across Clarion, Parakeet, and human agents
- Built internal scribe solution using Novel API/SDK
	- Achieved 95% accuracy on 300 PDF test
	- Moving to Canvas/Hyperscribe due to integration requirements
- Tested Sindarin for non-medical applications with 40% success rate

### Revenue Cycle Management

- Evaluated Enter, Candid, and Apero initially
- Transitioned to in-house team in Nicaragua:
	- 10-11 person team led by pit boss Maria
	- All tooling and reporting built internally
- Prior auth remains challenging
	- Maintaining provider trust critical for value-based approach adoption
	- Prioritizing human processing for reliability

### Strategic Outlook

- Shifting away from traditional venture funding
- Exploring debt financing options (previous SVB offer at 7%)
- Critical of Hinge/Omada approach of trying to replace humans
- Focus on AI implementation only where clear workflow and ROI exists
- Cannot simply eliminate call center staff due to multiple role requirements
- Targeting 50-70% referral improvement through targeted AI implementation
