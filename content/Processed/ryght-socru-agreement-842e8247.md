*   Site personnel shall make themselves reasonably available for occasional reference calls with other parties introduced to Site by Ryght.
*   In the event that Ryght names an industry advisory board, Site shall contemplate reasonable participation.
*   Ryght and Site will agree to a meeting cadence that takes into account both; the need for Ryght to capture enough feedback to generate the initial trial site co-pilots, and Site's schedule and resources.
*   Target project kick-off date: April, 2024
