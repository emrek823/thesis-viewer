### AI as Scaling Engine at Knownwell

- Obesity experts much less likely to use the platform than FNPs without obesity expertise
- Enables scaling expertise to “cheaper clinicians” without specialization
- Value-based care applications:
	- AI predicts most effective treatment based on time-to-outcome
	- Reduces costly trial-and-error methodology
	- Faster outcomes = lower total cost of care
- ROI positive despite upfront monthly AI costs

### Future Healthcare Vision & Opportunities

- Strong thesis: future of primary care is no primary care
	- AI enables centralized patient understanding
	- Direct routing to appropriate specialists without primary care middleman
	- Interested in companies like Doctronic building front-door systems
- Knownwell expansion plans:
	- 66% of obesity patients have additional chronic conditions
	- Multispecialty expansion planned vs. multiple point solution MSOs
- Large health system PSA partnerships can double reimbursement rates

### Next Steps

- Alex seeking VC transition from current data science role at Knownwell
	- Part-time investor at Pioneer Fund (XYZ)
	- Previous successful bets: Bland (Series B), Assort Health
