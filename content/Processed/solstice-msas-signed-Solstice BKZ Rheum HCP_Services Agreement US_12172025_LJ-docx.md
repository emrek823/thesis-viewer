## 11. Insurance Coverage

During the term of this Agreement, Provider shall maintain insurance policies with a reputable insurance company (rated "A" by credit risk agencies), adequate to cover Provider's liabilities arising from the performance of this Agreement, including professional insurance liability with an insurance limit equal to a minimum of one (1) million U.S. dollars.

Any amounts unpaid by Provider may be set-off by Customer against any other amounts that may be due to Customer under the Agreement.

## 13. Relationship of Parties

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided for in this Agreement, the parties acknowledge and agree that Provider is an independent contractor in the performance of the Services, and this Agreement does not constitute or appoint Provider or any Provider personnel as an employee or agent of Customer. Nothing in this Agreement will be construed as creating a joint venture, partnership, or employment relationship between the parties nor will either party have the right, power, or authority to create any obligation or duty, express or implied, on behalf of the other.

## 14. Notices

All notices under this Agreement shall be in writing, and shall be deemed given when personally delivered, or three (3) days after being sent by prepaid certified or registered U.S. mail to the address of the party to be noticed as set forth herein or such other address as such party last provided to the other by written notice.

No delay or failure on the part of either Customer or Provider in exercising any right hereunder and no partial or single exercise thereof will be deemed to constitute a waiver of such right or any other rights hereunder.

This Agreement shall be exclusively construed, governed and enforced under the laws of the State of Georgia (without regard to rules governing conflict of laws). Any and all provisions, promises and warranties contained herein which by their nature or effect are required or intended to be observed, kept or performed after termination of this Agreement will survive the termination of this Agreement and remain binding upon and for the benefit of the parties hereto. No modifications, additions, or amendments to this Agreement will be effective unless made in writing and signed by duly authorized representatives of the parties. In the event of a conflict between the terms of this Agreement and those contained in any addendum, exhibit, schedule of Purchase Order, the terms of this Agreement shall supersede such other terms. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original but all of which together will be deemed for all purposes to constitute one and the same instrument. Signatures transmitted and received via facsimile or other electronic means will be treated as original signatures for all purposes of this Agreement. The parties agree that an electronically stored copy of this Agreement shall be admissible in any court proceeding and waive any objection thereto.
