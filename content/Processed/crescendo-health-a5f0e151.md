# Crescendo's journey

### Phase 1: 2021-2022 Build And Validate Core Solution
*   Hired foundational team
*   Built core solution
*   Validated internally & with top-3 CRO partner

### Phase 2: Current-2024, Build referenceable commercial traction
*   Achieved ~$550K ARR with late-stage pipeline in excess of $9M ARR (proposal or contracting stage)
*   Current CRO partnership primed for rapid expansion
*   Robust early stage pipeline across CRO and life sciences

### Phase 3: 2024 and Beyond
*   Establish "beach heads" in top biopharma
*   Become established as "always-on" component in US studies

## Slide 14: Commercial model

# Commercial model

### Customer Archetype
Typical customer is biopharma, device, diagnostics, or a contract research organization
Champion usually has VP or Senior Director title and responsibility for clinical development, real-world evidence, or post-marketing studies

### Pricing
Initial contracts are study-by-study, with fixed fee of ~$150K per year and $150-400 per participant per year depending on study complexity
Future contracts aim to transition to platform fee with pricing tied to tiers of utilization

### Stickiness
Conservative nature of industry / regulators tends to consolidation around trusted vendor
Crescendo increases in-account stickiness by serving multiple functions involved in research / commercialization from the same core dataset collected for the study

## Slide 15: Harnessing CRO partnerships to achieve rapid scale

# Harnessing CRO partnerships to achieve rapid scale

### Why invest in CRO Partnerships?
*   75% of clinical trials are managed through Contract Research Organizations ("CROs")
*   Trials are highly concentrated among the top 5 CROs
*   Crescendo's study designs preserve high-margin CRO activities while reducing low-margin costs
*   Crescendo can scale to quickly access a high volume of studies under a single MSA
*   As CROs incorporate Crescendo into study bids, Crescendo's brand awareness and credibility grows, accelerating direct sales to biopharma

### Case Study: Top 3 CRO

#### Crescendo Growth:
*   Late 2021: Signed initial partnership
*   Mid-2022: Completion of initial validation studies
*   Late 2022 / Early 2023: Reviews and approvals to support broad integration to CRO bids
*   July 2023: Signed SOW expansion to $550K ARR (with additional revenue opportunity for each Crescendo study sold), incorporation into bids

#### Partnership Today:
*   CRO recently approved broad incorporation of Crescendo into their study bids currently averaging 2/week (to sponsors like Janssen, Pfizer, and Abbvie)
*   Champions range from C-suite to commercial leaders pursuing new studies
