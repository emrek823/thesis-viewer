Solstice is at $2.3M ARR after pivoting from medical record retrieval to biopharma content commercialization in September 2025. The company has scaled rapidly with top-10 pharma customers despite founders having zero prior biopharma experience. They're preparing for a Series A raise in January 2026 targeting $15M to reach $15M ARR.
