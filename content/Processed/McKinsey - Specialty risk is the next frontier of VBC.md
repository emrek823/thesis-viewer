# McKinsey: Specialty Risk Is the Next Frontier of Value-Based Care

McKinsey research shows specialty care is dramatically underpenetrated in VBC despite controlling majority of healthcare spending.

## VBC Penetration Gap

| Specialty | VBC Coverage |
|-----------|-------------|
| Primary Care | 50%+ of Medicare members |
| Nephrology | ~28% |
| Orthopedics | ~20% |
| Cardiology | <5% |
| Oncology | <5% |
| Women's Health | <5% |
| Behavioral Health | <5% |

Medical specialists and surgeons have **50% lower odds** of participating in VBC contracts compared with primary care physicians.

## Spending Impact

- **Specialty care = 38%** of total medical spending
- **Specialty-influenced = 68%** of total cost of care (referrals, procedures, drugs)
- Specialty-led complex disease VBC models remain underused

## Market Projections

- **2022:** 43M lives in VBC
- **2027 (projected):** 90M lives in VBC
- Specialty VBC penetration (orthopedics, nephrology) could **more than double** in 5 years

## Savings Potential

Even conservative estimates indicate potential **$100B/year reduction** in Medicare and commercial specialty spending through better management.

## Policy Direction

2025 CMMI strategy includes:
- Expanding specialty VBC models to Medicare Advantage and Medicaid
- Increasing participation of independent specialists
