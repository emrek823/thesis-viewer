# The top biotech seed investors, and how to raise from them

by Jonathan Algoo and Richard Murphey

  

This post will cover:

* A list of good seed-stage biotech investors
* A list of helpful resources on how to raise seed funding
* A discussion of the different types of investors funding seed-stage biotech companies
* An overview of the fundraising process
* Some alternative ways of funding your company

Until very recently, biotech venture capital was only available to seasoned big pharma executives with extensive networks. If you were a young scientific founder, raising your initial capital was very difficult.

But that has changed. In the last few years, dozens of new funds have emerged specifically to invest in young scientific founders. These new investors are embracing founders that have traditionally been overlooked by the biotech VC community.

If you are a young scientific entrepreneur, there has never been a better time to start a company. But that doesn't mean it is easy. This post will provide some resources to help first-time scientific founders understand the fundraising process.

  

### The top biotech seed investors

  

To create this list, I asked biotech founders in my network which investors they would recommend. I only asked founders who had raised $1M or more in seed capital in the last two years. Thus every investor on this list (as of Q4 2020) is 1) actively investing and 2) is founder-friendly.

The downside of this methodology is that this list is not comprehensive. Because it is limited to founders I know, this list certainly omits great investors. If you are a founder and think an investor should be added, [let me know](https://goo.gl/forms/kHRFwxfXidRVZsDf1).

If you are interested in getting feedback on your pitch or learning more about investors and fundraising, we're experimenting with a few programs to help: 1) office hours and pitch feedback from founders who've recently raised seed capital and 2) "founder support groups" where 4-6 founders get together each month or so to help each other out. If you're interested in participating, let us know [here](https://forms.gle/gVawWFEukbDoQTPW9).
