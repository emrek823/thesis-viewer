### Chris’s Background & Research Focus

- Stanford PhD student working on AI agents and self-evolution
	- AlphaEvolve, ShinkaEvolve from Sakana AI, Darwin Girl Machine
	- Variant effect prediction for DNA sequences
	- Challenge is building good evals; skeptical these work outside frontier labs
- Academic bio research experience at UCSF
	- Observed limitations in understanding of biology causing pharma to funnel into same targets
	- Goal: build computer systems to automate discovery process
- Previous experience at Databank, Nuna, Health Engine
	- Worked on life sciences record retrieval
	- Independently developed same oil industry analogy as Alejandro for internal pitch
- End goal: build venture-backed business, preferably consumer-facing like Council Health
	- Strong belief in giving healthcare agency back to consumers
	- Interest in sophisticated polygenic risk scores when sequencing becomes ubiquitous

### AI & Biology Research Insights

- Virtual cells (Arc Institute definition)
	- Takes chemical/genetic perturbation, predicts output in same modality
	- Current models treat cell like black box (DNA perturbation → RNA transcripts)
- BoltzGen creator’s perspective
	- Docking predictions based on protein folding principles
	- Same physical principles underlie folding and protein interactions
	- True generalization requires understanding underlying physics, not just pattern matching
	- Question: can we generalize without learning biomolecular fundamentals?
- Spatial biology work
	- Lab focuses on interpolating cells across space and time
	- Major research area gaining traction

### Connection Opportunities

- Dorm Room Fund requirements
	- One founding team member must be on campus or graduated within last year
- Requested introduction to Sagan Schultz and David Dang
	- Building deeper sequencing/function offering for $10k/year
	- Aligns with Chris’s vision for sophisticated consumer genomics
- Chris interested in Chinese asset marketplace discussion
	- Notes political sensitivity vs. market reality (9 of 10 Sanofi data rooms are Chinese assets)
