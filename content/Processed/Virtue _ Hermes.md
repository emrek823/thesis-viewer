### Business Updates and Traction

- Carpenter & Zuckerman deal signed and onboarded
	- 60 lawyers integrated with Salesforce
	- 1,200 record requests sent at $50 each
	- Monthly run rate ~$500/month plus Site Sonar usage at $15/patient
- Keller Postman (3rd largest mass tort firm) starting with 100 records
	- Pilot expected to scale to 1,000/month
- Site Sonar solution margins: $15 charge, $5 cost = 66% margin
	- Essentially no operational work required
- Record retrieval margins currently $50 charge, ~$30 cost
	- Margins improve as direct ROI vendor connections increase

### Network Partnership Progress

- Contracted and implemented: Veritas, Waystar
- In contracting/implementation: ShareCare, MRO, Anuvolon, Office Ally, Healthmark, Barisma, SSI, Epic, Truvana, Exam One
- 6-month lag time from first contact to implementation
- Clear 6-7 month growth path established

### Market Timing and Competitive Advantages

- API readiness now enabling identified data access
	- DataVant launched API 2.5 years ago
	- ShareCare launched API this year
	- Healthmark, Athena launching APIs in November
- Government pushing ROI vendors to create APIs to reduce costs
- Two separate worlds merging: identified data world ignorant of monetization opportunities, de-identified world unaware of use cases
- Express Imaging Services CEO example: completely unaware data could be purchased from Walgreens/CVS or claims clearinghouses

### Network Effects and Defensibility

- Klein Guard law firm now waiting for vendors to join Hermes network rather than contracting directly
- First instance of customers choosing network over direct relationships
- 12-18 month window to build defensible network before competition
- DataVant has limited connections (2-3 ROI vendors, 1-2 EHRs) for this use case
- Winner-take-all dynamic due to switching costs once network established

### Strategic Focus and Funding Requirements

- Phase 1: Achieve relevance (current pre-seed funding)
- Phase 2: Build ubiquity across custodian network (seed round target)
- Phase 3: Long tail monetization and reinforcement (Series A)
- Law firms chosen as initial market due to acute pain and technical sophistication
- ROI vendors prioritized for atomic network - provide coverage and raw medical data access
- Eventually will integrate directly with EHRs (400+ exist) which may create tension with ROI partners
