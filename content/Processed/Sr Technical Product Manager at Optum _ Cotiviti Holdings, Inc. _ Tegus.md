# Health Insurance Subrogation Discussion

## Participants
- **Client**: Interested in health insurance subrogation
- **Expert**: Product Director at UnitedHealthcare Group

----

### Client Introduction
Hi. Thanks for taking the time to talk with me. I am interested in learning more about health insurance subrogation. Maybe before getting into anything specific, would love to hear your quick background to the extent there's parts or segments of the market where you spent much more time, definitely curious to hear that as well.

### Expert Background
Thanks for giving me that context, that helps a lot. For me, a little over 18 years of healthcare payer experience. I worked at Humana for about 10 years, and I worked in provider network operations there and worked with pre- and post-payment and subrogation teams, both as an analyst and then a consultant and then a manager.

I worked a couple years at Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield, and then the last nine years have been at UnitedHealthcare Group and a little bit of time at Optum as well, and that's across all lines of business, Medicare Advantage, Medicaid, commercial.

Obviously, for a large payer like UnitedHealthcare Group, we have about 64 million medical members across all those lines of business, we're a national payer, so very large. When you think of how we use third-party vendors, sometimes we do things internally and sometimes we use vendors and sometimes they overlap and sometimes they intentionally overlap.

Currently right now, I'm a product director at UnitedHealthcare Group, and I work with subrogation and RBP solutions. That looks like overseeing some of the strategic development for the optimization of these recovery platforms. Certainly, I've been a part of a lot of managing vendor relationships, build versus buy decision-type things, and then just balancing our members' experience with recovery performance.

### Vendor Relationships
I can speak to a lot of the vendors that Optum uses, certainly like The Phia Group, which is more for customized programs or mass tort expertise, and then Rawlings Group, which is actually located here in Louisville, Kentucky. I almost worked for them for a little while. That's a funny story there. They are a claims industry leader in recoveries. Their headquarters is in Louisville.

We use Conduent for about 30% of our recovery lift. I've worked in the past with Carelon when I was at Anthem for a little bit and I have a lot of familiarity with Claritev and MultiPlan, now that they've merged for more of their data-driven approach with machine learning and added network claims and things like that.

### Client Inquiry on Vendor Selection
Got it. We can just go there first. Would love to understand how you think about selecting vendors. It sounds like for a large payer organization like yourselves you're typically using multiple vendors maybe for different areas of expertise. I have a sense for the big players, Rawlings, Phia, I think Intellivo is another one that's come up.

Optum has, via acquisition, some internal kind of capabilities as well. I think that was the Equian business. Some of the other ones you mentioned as well. Maybe would love to hear about how you think about using multiple vendors, why you go with that approach, who the key players are in each of the segments or capability specialty areas.

### Expert on Vendor Selection Process
Obviously, selection process for us, for a large payer, it's a very multi-stakeholder evaluation team. It includes legal and ops and IT and procurement, and we do a weighted scoring system and some vendor demonstration over time so that we can assess that real-world performance for any kind of final contract negotiations happening. A lot of these demos, I've been a part of them.

We usually pilot an area or a state or a market or a sub-population group where we feel like there is a good fit. When we do these pilots, started out in a stage environment before it gets to a production environment, and make sure we've got APIs that talk back and forth and reporting and there's audit trails behind it. A lot of security issues have to be worked out with our tech teams and legal teams. All of that happens.

If I back that up a little bit, for us at UHG, I'd say about 25%-30% of the technical capabilities happen, things like recovery rate per employee per year, the PEPY, or case identification accuracy, a lot of our technology platform integration with UHG's claim systems, AI, machine learning capabilities, automated detection, and data analytics.

What we would call operational excellence, which is maybe the other 25%-30%, and that's more looking at staffing levels and geographic coverage and case resolution, things like that. What their cost structure looks like, security and compliance, and are they a good strategic fit for us? At a very high level, that's how we would break it out.

We use a lot of the major subrogation vendors, you mentioned Equian, it's also widely used by others, like Blue Cross and Blue Shield for subrogation services. We've used The Rawlings Group, I mentioned, obviously for post-payment for subrogation. They outsource to probably 80% of the private health insurance market. They don't work with just us, they work with the Humanas and the Anthems of the world and CVSes and some of the others.

Each vendor, they compete on those recovery rates and their technology sophistication, what kind of legal expertise they have and their specialized capabilities, like are they good at mass tort representation or complex case handling? They all have little niches in their ability. We probably do pros and cons for those, if that helps a little bit, from our perspective.

**Client**
Got it. You mentioned pre-pay versus post-pay. I'd be curious, is that a decision you oversee? Do you focus more on the post pay side? If you told someone about this in a vacuum, they might be like, "Why don't you just try and solve everything pre-pay?" Obviously, that's not what happens, and there's a lot of stuff post-pay. Curious how you balance those two.

**Expert**
If you asked me 18 years ago, all our spend at Humana was on the post-pay side, that's where our whole focus was. In the last five years, it's the complete opposite shift, now it's all pre-pay, is where the money is getting really spent. I wouldn't say it's all getting spent there, I found both sides. I would say that our growth on pre-pay for ROI is much better than on the post-pay side, in that proactive.

If your system can flag a potential subrogation case before claims payment, and then you can get an immediate investigation, potentially deny that payment until the liability is determined, you're likely to get a higher recovery rate, you're likely to get a stronger negotiating position, you're going to prevent an initial payout that you didn't want and reduce overall administrative costs.

Of course, that comes with some member experience potential friction, and it can lead to some care delays, things like that. Whereas if you are on the post-pay side, that claim's already been paid, now you've got to go to a subrogation vendor who's going to charge you a lot for that. You probably have a lower recovery rate, and you have a time decay that reduces your collection success and a cash flow impact there.

You still may have member abrasion, because a lot of times your members are uncooperative after they've received care. It's harder to go back there and say, "Hey, it was actually wrong." That can make them equally as upset. I think that it's critical that we get it right, whether it's in pre-pay or post-pay, that's critical.

I think it's less expensive overall for us if we can catch things in pre-pay. You see a lot of large payers spending millions and millions of dollars on AI solutions and business logic and edits and their pre-pay systems, and very complex custom algorithms that they're building.

In the simplest form, like things I used to do was, on the pre-pay side is building a claims engine that would look at, if you broke your arm in Kentucky, and you went to a doctor and they fixed it, and it builds certain

## Discussion on Pre-Pay vs. Post-Pay Claims Processing

### Expert Insights

- **Diagnosis Codes Example**:
- A diagnosis code billed for $1,000 in one state (e.g., Texas) versus $3,000 in California raises flags for review.
- The focus is on understanding discrepancies in pricing for the same services provided by the same type of doctor.

- **Claims Review Process**:
- Claims that are flagged will be analyzed to determine if the issue lies with provider rates or systemic errors.
- Anomalous claims will be grouped for pre-pay review.

### Client Inquiry

- **Build vs. Buy Mindset**:
- The client asks if pre-pay is more about building internal capabilities versus buying from vendors.

### Expert Response

- **Build vs. Buy**:
- Pre-pay systems require real-time claims processing integration, sophisticated predictive analytics, and seamless connectivity with EMR and provider portals.
- Deep integration with UnitedHealthcare Group's core claims infrastructure is essential, which is challenging for vendors to replicate.
- UHG's data advantage allows for custom algorithms tailored to specific member populations, enhancing member experience.

- **Post-Pay Side**:
- Post-pay processes can easily partner with vendors since they operate independently after claims processing.
- Vendors can manage recovery processes without interfacing with core systems.

### Client Follow-Up

- **Budget Trends**:
- The client inquires about trends in budget spending on pre-pay versus post-pay.

### Expert Analysis

- **Investment Trends**:
- There has been significant investment in pre-pay solutions, with hundreds of millions of dollars allocated.
- The trend over the last four to five years shows a shift towards AI-driven pre-pay solutions.
- Approximately 70% of major healthcare payers are focusing on upstream pre-payment solutions.
- An estimated $900 billion in annual healthcare waste is being targeted for reduction through AI-powered pre-pay editing and fraud detection.

- **Effectiveness of Pre-Pay Solutions**:
- Pre-payment solutions are favored as post-payment recovery captures only about 30% of errors.
- AI in pre-payment can deliver immediate ROI.

## Transcript

**Client:**
Let's say we're five years down the line in pre-pay, all the solutions work out super well, you're capturing more things up front, the result of that would probably mean that there's less money being spent on the post-pay side, or certainly less for them to recover, is that the thinking?

**Expert:**
You're asking, would post-pay decrease in the next three to five years because of all of this AI investment in the pre-pay? I'm trying to think if I would say that's an absolute yes, or if I want to caveat that with kind of "But wait." I would say it wouldn't disappear, but it will significantly decrease.

If you had 80% implementation successful pre-pay scenario in five years, you could shrink subrogation by 60%, maybe, in volume. I still think you're going to have some complex cases that are going to have human judgment, things like disputed liability scenarios or if you've got a multi-state legal complication or a mass tort situation, cases that the liability takes months or years to determine, things like delayed injury, manifestation, product recalls, those kinds of things.

That's where traditional subrogation vendors would need to probably pivot more towards specialized legal services or complex case management, and supporting pre-pay systems, being more comprehensive in their services, rather than high-volume routine recovery.

All that said, I look at Rawlings, 20 minutes from my house, and the CEO is a billionaire. They're still going strong. I don't think that there's a lack of work right now that would cause them to shut their doors anytime soon. Will they become more comprehensive? They've got to know that as a business, that if they're a post-pay vendor primarily, are they going to merge or work with somebody or be acquired to survive, or are they going to just build their own pre-pay software and start working on that?

I'm sure they already have a lot of really smart experts in that area, and they can bring in people and then build systems. It depends on how much investment they've got and how much they want to make into that and what they see the future of subrogation being in-house with vendors.

**Client:**
Makes total sense. How do vendors like Apixio and Cotiviti, you mentioned, how do they fit into this picture? What are you typically leveraging them for? Would you consider them more on the pre-pay side?

**Expert:**
I probably should just give you a list of the ones I know. Apixio and Cotiviti are probably the two that lead pre-pay transformation. That's why I brought them up. There's others too. I would say they're the pre-payment leaders with AI-powered claims review and predictive analytics emphasis. They can do a lot of automated pre-payment editing capabilities, and they do a lot of machine learning technology for claims processing to reduce fraudulent claims, pre-processing times.

I think both of those vendors have pivoted away from a very traditional post-pay recovery in the past, few years ago, towards more of this real-time claim intervention. I know Cotiviti offers very much integrated pre-pay fraud prevention, Apixio clinical AI to identify payment anomalies before the claims get adjudicated.

That's going to give them a competitive advantage right now amongst all the other vendors we've been talking about, the fact that they can integrate directly with the payers claim systems for all those things. Traditional subrogation vendors like Rawlings and Phia Group and Equian, they're still operating in a lot of these post-payment workflows.

If I'm UHG, and I'm looking at build versus buy middle ground, I would think that UHG would be likely to want to license or integrate rather than build it from scratch and still be able to maintain some control over the member experience and some of the core claims processing.

You got to be able to validate a business case for UHG to develop similar capabilities as well, especially given the fact that we have really strong relationships with Optum Insight and some of their offerings around existing AI and clinical data that they do, as long as they want to focus on this, I think that would be the other point I'd make. Yes, because their hands are in a lot of different things for tech-enabled stuff around AI and machine learning.

## Client
Got it. Is the right way to think about pre-pay workflow, the member visits a provider, some care is provided, the claim file is created, and then essentially in the time between that claim file being created and the claim being adjudicated and paid, you're trying to capture as much there in that window of time as possible, is that the right way to think about the workflow?

## Expert
I think that's a good high-level way of thinking about the workflow. T0 is your day of service, a member visits ER for maybe an accident-related injury. At that moment, real-time eligibility is supposed to happen to check flags for potential third-party liability based on diagnosis codes, whether it's a fracture, a trauma, or an ICD-10 code, related to that.

In your first couple of days, days one through three, that's when the claim submission happens, the provider is going to submit it. Ideally, it's an AI-powered pre-pay system that immediately cross-references police report databases, DMV records, workers' comp, that kind of thing.

From days four to seven, that's where, what you were talking about, the critical capture window happens, where you have automated outreach through text or email to the member while that incident's still fresh, making sure, was this related to an auto accident or a work injury or something?

That triggers a deeper investigation where the system's going to automatically request contracts for liable to the party's insurance or police reports or things like that, and place a payment on hold while it gathers that liability information and the member receives a notification at the same time.

It's going to make a decision point to either process it normally with no third-party liability found, or transfer it to that specialized recovery team, so you have some settlement negotiation. You're trying to hit about a 14-day total window at most. If you can make a liability determination within those 14 days, then it should reduce your post-payment recovery efforts significantly, and improve member satisfaction through a faster resolution. That's the ballpark numbers we try to hit.

## Client
Got it. Maybe we can go to the post-pay subrogation side then. I'd be curious, do you have a sense for what the funnel of claims looks like? I'm trying to determine like, of third-party liability, how much is flagged through pre-pay, how much goes through post-pay?

## Expert
I'll give you an example. I've done those many times. We have a nice little beautiful chart. It's so much easier to visually show it than it is to walk through it on a phone call. I will say that it's like a pyramid. If you're looking at the post-pay subrogation claims funnel, in reality, your first stage or your top stage would be your initial identification.

Let's say you take like 100,000 potential cases that are flagged for paid claims, these trauma codes, ER visits, etc., and you get 70% false positives that have been eliminated through basic screening. It takes out chronic conditions, self-inflicted injuries, things like that, and 30,000 of these 100,000 potential cases get advanced to investigation, because there were 70% false positives.

Those 30,000 cases that advance, they go to stage two, which would be member contact and investigation. Let's say 40% are non-responsive members, those are ones that have moved or they changed their contact info or they're just uncooperative. 25% of them get denied through third-party involvement or providers'

## Text Transcription

incomplete information that we have on them. The other 35% confirm potential liabilities. Of those 30,000, now you're down to 10,500 cases that move forward, because 35% of them have confirmed potential liability.

We would go to stage three, which is a liability investigation. Let's say of those 10,500, 30% have insufficient evidence, there's no police report, inadequate documentation, so disputed fault. 20% of them are a liable party, uninsured judgment proof, there's no recovery potential that we can find. We get 50% viable cases of that 10,500.

Now we're down to 5,250 cases, where we can pursue recovery on stage four, the last stage, recovery execution. That would be like, 25% of them maybe will settle quickly. It's obviously clear liability, that's about 1,300 cases. 35% require some extensive negotiation. Usually, that's ballpark of six to 18 months, somewhere in that timeframe, maybe a little longer. About 1,800 of those cases will require some extensive negotiation.

Finally, your 40% that actually result in minimal or no recovery, those litigation costs exceed the potential recovery or maybe statute of limitation issues. You got about 2,000 cases that have been closed. Of that 100,000, your final outcome is about 3,150 successful recoveries, from that original 100,000 flagged claims, which is about a 3% success rate. It averages about 18-24 months from the time that injury actually happened to recovery completion. That's my little pyramid chart example.

That is a reality of post-pay subrogation claims funnel today. You can subset that out to know that we have hundreds of thousands of claims every year annually at UHG, tens of thousands of claims every month. A 3% success rate isn't great for all that volume that we have to sit through.

### Client
I'm curious, if you think about this funnel, where do you hope that there are the most room for opportunity? I'm just thinking through it. Some of it's an upfront data collection issue. How do you think about those?

### Expert Sean Doolan
You're going right where I was going to go. I think your most room for opportunity, your greatest opportunity, is really early, stage one and stage two of that example. You want to get that false positive reduction, instead of it being 70%, you want it to be 30%, ideally.

That false positive rate represents a massive inefficiency. Your AI-powered pre-pay system is using that clinical context, it's looking at those injury patterns, it's looking at real-time data sources across a lot of different data sources. It should be able to reduce it from 70% to closer to 40% or 30%. By doing that, it immediately improves your stage two throughput from 30,000-70,000 quality cases.

Your stage two gets better, because it's a domino effect, where your member response rate goes from maybe 35% to now it's hitting 60% or 65%. 40% of these non-responsive rate is a really big leakage point. Your opportunity is by having that real-time engagement while that member is still in the treatment phase, and we can do that through a lot of different ways, using things like digital-first communication like text and app notifications and provider portal integration, rather than just your traditional mail and phone call that usually happens weeks later.

You've got to remember that it's just happened, it's fresh in their memory, there's immediate relevance, and it dramatically improves cooperation from our members. It's very time-sensitive evidence capture. When you move away from post-pay, you're now doing these immediate captures, and you've got evidence degradation over time that happens.

I think it's a combined impact. If you can fix stages one and two, it transforms that whole funnel from maybe 3% to maybe like 15% or 20% success rate, because you've gotten better targeting and better quality cases and higher response rates. That's why pre-pay investment is really compelling in our industry right now, because it's attacking your biggest inefficiencies on that funnel.

Yup. At the very top of the funnel, you said 100,000 claims, let's say, get flagged, 30% advance to stage two, but 70% are those very basic false positives. I'm just curious, are there humans spending a lot of time on those 70%, or that is pretty efficient today, where that 70%, through data analysis, data mining, you're able to determine is a false positive pretty quickly?

**Expert**
Unfortunately, I hate to say it, but it's a massive human resource waste on that 70%. Today, a human analyst will spend about two to four hours per case on those initial screenings. They'll do manual reviewing of matching records, check those diagnosis codes against the billing pattern, looking at the member history, and they're going to make that preliminary liability assessment.

If you have 70,000 false positives, I'm just doing the math real quick, and they spend three hours on average, you've got about 210,000 human hours every year spent on cases that aren't going to yield any kind of recovery. If we pay our analysts, let's say, $35 an hour, because that's a close ballpark.

When I was at Humana and also at UHG, that's a ballpark, that's the analyst salary plus benefits. That's seven figures annually wasted on those false positives at somewhere like UnitedHealthcare Group. That's not even the downstream costs, where that case advances to a more expensive stage before it gets eliminated.

**Client**
That makes sense. One related question is, are there cases that just get missed today? I know we spend a lot of time talking about false positives, but curious if the opposite also happens where there's really valuable dollars to be recovered and they're just not picked up in the system today, or is that less of a problem?

**Expert**
Not just false positives, is what you're asking?

**Client**
Yeah.

**Sean Doolan**

**Expert**
The answer is yes. I think you have a false negative problem, which is what we call it. There's certainly some detection gaps. Things like delayed manifestation injuries I mentioned earlier, example of that is if you've got a member that visits an urgent care for a minor back pain, like me right now after working out. After the incident, they're developing more chronic issues, they're going to have a more expensive treatment months later. That original claim had none of those trauma codes.

If there's a multi-visit scenario where initially our visit was coded as a chest pain kind of anxiety, and then they follow up later to reveal something like an auto accident injury, and a subrogation flag is really only going to capture that obvious trauma on the first visit, any kind of provider coding variations, which happens a lot.

We estimate, and I think the industry estimates, around about 30%-40% of legitimate subrogation cases are never getting identified, which is a big number under current post-pay methods. For our scale, when we look at that number at UHG, that could be about 40,000-50,000 missed recovery opportunities annually. They're just missed because of obviously that time decay, but also fragmented data.

When those claims get processed in those silos without any kind of cross-visit analysis, it's really hard to create that whole picture, pre- and post-timeline with a member to know that, and you really have to have really good information on the front side to catch it, or to predict it.

I think providers are often using very cautious diagnosis codes initially, and then they upgrade it later as those conditions develop. Because of that, that causes misses too. It makes more sense to spend our money in pre-pay for that AI advantage in a lot of cases.

You can catch some of these subtle patterns, like claims timing, correlation. It's crazy the kinds of things.

## Transcript of Discussion

**Expert:**
They're doing. They look at police reports, but they also look at social media activity, and they look at the pharmacy fills for the pain medications, and they look at sequential provider visits, and then collect members' GPS data. It's pretty crazy what some of the pre-pay AI stuff can do. It's probably a whole other call to determine if it should be done, but we'll leave that call for another call.

It's pretty wild what a lot of these third-party vendors can collect and grab and how they use their correlations to it, and then how accurate those predictions end up being. There is a lot of financial impact in missed cases, and for large payers, there's a big opportunity more than just that false positive reduction.

**Client:**
That makes sense. One thing that strikes me is that if you had access to the clinical notes between the member and provider, that could unearth some findings. Is that something that happens today? Is that something that you're not even allowed to do? I'm curious about that.

**Expert:**
Great question. Absolutely. I think that, and not just with subrogation, but across so many of our teams I've been a part of, clinical notes are game-changing. Currently, claims only capture those ICD-10 codes and very basic procedure information. The example I gave you earlier with the back pain diagnosis, it's giving you no context.

If you now have clinical notes from the PA or the PT or the doctor stating that "Hey, the patient fell down the stairs at the shopping mall or MVA yesterday, feeling sore today," these kind of clinical notes advantages give you injury details. Things like patient reports being rear-ended while at traffic stopped at light, and they've got generic neck pain, and then you can do some timeline context analysis.

There's a lot of NLP or natural language processing detection opportunities. The AI can scan the clinical notes for those keywords, like accident or fell or workplace or someone else's fault or things like that. Those never appear in the structured claims data, and they're gold mines for subrogation, because now we can marry those two things, the clinical data with the claims data, and really have a whole picture over time now, because it's a whole another touch point that we can tie together.

Really, it's not just the fact that it can tie them together, it's the fact that AI has the time and ability to look at those notes that we don't have the time to look at, beyond just the ICD codes as a pair. We can't have a person looking at every single utilization review.

Granted, I know CVS because my brother's a registered nurse and he works for CVS right now, and he is getting paid a six-figure salary to do utilization review on cases to determine if they're denied or not. I keep telling myself, "I don't know how they can afford to do that for very long." If he looks at five or six cases a day and makes a determination, I don't know if that's very profitable.

I would say that the volume impact is big. Accessing clinical notes to identify two to three times more legitimate cases, and now you have 100,000 flagged claims goes to 200,000 or 300,000 potential recoveries, you're going to have much higher accuracy rates.

We do more than that too. Even today, we look at NLP for notes within the doctor time to the claim, but we also use social determinants of health data as well to try to tie to our clinical data. We do that more on the Medicaid and commercial lines of business. Certainly, social determinants of health or SDOH data that happens outside of the doctor's office also impacts members' health. You can start getting data touch points from that as well. That impacts a lot of our Medicaid and VA populations, and we can tie that data back to our claims data.

You really have three big primary opportunities for data silos, and I'm sure there'll be more in the future too, that can be integrated and become very powerful direct strategic advantages. You've got EMR access through provider relationships, and that gives clinical note visibility that a lot of external vendors can't even match, with UHG and Optum's integration being really powerful in that area for internal subrogation capabilities.

## Client
Got it. As the health plan, you're able to have unfettered access to this data, or is that a challenge at all?

## Expert
You're thinking about that from a health plan perspective, you're asking that?

## Client
Yeah. If I'm United or Humana, and I want to leverage this data for either pre-pay or post-pay analytics, in an ideal world, the data science and analysis is another thing, but the upfront part is getting access to it, I would think. I'm wondering if that's a challenge or that's actually quite easy.

## Expert
For us, I would never say it's easy, but I would say it's easier for us than it is for a third-party vendor, for sure. Just from our position of where we sit and being one of the largest MCOs in the country, I think there's some leverage there that's inherent. I think that healthcare clinical data access has always been challenging, but it's improved.

You have a lot of fragmented systems, because we have to use different EMRs with our different providers, hospital and network doctor groups around the country. We use Epic and Cerner, there's Allscripts, and there's very limited interoperability there. You have some provider resistance where those practices are reluctant to share detailed clinical notes beyond just minimum claims requirements, that happens a lot in our FQHCs or rural area hospitals, like in North Texas or middle California areas.

There's also technical barriers where you have some of these APIs that exist out there in the world, but they have to have some custom integration that's required for them to be set up for each provider system. There's that. I think those are some of the current challenges, but a lot of the payers, including us, are trying to move a lot of our provider groups on these value-based contracts where there's some risk-sharing arrangements, and that gives the payer some legitimate need for clinical data access and contractual obligation, I should say.

**Sean Doolan**
**DO NOT COPY**
**sd@virtuevc.com**
We really emphasize, "Hey, look guys, we need the clinical notes to approve some of these expensive treatments that you want done." This can create some data exchange momentum. We can also tie this into some of our quality programs like HEDIS and Star Ratings that require this clinical data, and that'll normalize deeper access for us. We're heavily spending technology investments in provider portal integration and data exchanges, so I think yes.

UHG's unique position with Optum with direct EMR access and through some of our EHR partnerships with Epic and Cerner for population health, analytics gives us a very big advantage as well as a scale advantage there. If I were to make a prediction on that, I would say maybe in three to five years, 60%-70% of the clinical note access will happen, where you may hit somewhere around there.

From what you told me, you're looking at this from an economics perspective. If you're a large payer through a combination of things like regulatory pressure and economic incentives like this value-based care and some of just the maturation of technology and FHIR standards, then I think we can get to, in three to five years, around 60% of clinical note access.

## Client
Got it. One question I had was just, and maybe defer to you on whether there's ways you've looked at it, but I'm just curious what the market size is for spend on subrogation-related activities, whether it's pre-pay, post-pay. One way to look at it would be how much these vendors are recovering. Obviously, they take a cut of that. Curious if you've heard any stats out there of how much dollars worth of subrogation claims are being recovered.

## Expert
Based on the end of 2024, we do studies annually on this, so we have to know these numbers pretty well, or at least have a pretty good ballpark on them. I would say that the healthcare subrogation market, you've got

# Expert Discussion on AI and Pre-Payment Solutions

## Expert Insights

Yeah. As far as I know today, I don't know that Rawlings does anything other than post-pay. That changed in the last year. I know they did just have a pretty big merger recently, but I haven't done the homework on what that's providing them. I think it was Machinify. Machinify is a really big advanced AI for pre-payment error prevention, that's their core business. Guess what? They realized it.

They're shifting left with that. I would say that if your technology-first vendors like Cotiviti and Apixio, Machinify would have been one of them, and Lyric AI is another one, they used to be ClaimsXten. They're probably your top four technology-first vendors in the market.

You've got more traditional players that are pivoting too. We just acquired Change Healthcare, they're a massive claims processing platform. McKesson's another big one. Conduent has a hybrid pre- and post-pay solutions where they can focus on recovery, lift claims. I would say that they're really big.

From a health plan, the internal leaders, UHG and Optum, and then Humana control about 50% of the Medicare Advantage business, so they're big players there. Anthem, now Elevance, is really big through Carelon subsidiary in this market. You have some emerging smaller ones that I don't know if they'll get consolidated. Intellivo and HealthEdge, they're AI-powered case identification payer platforms that have a lot of integrated payment integrity modules there. I would say they would be ones to watch. There's probably others.

I think a lot of these traditional post-pay vendors like Rawlings and Phia Group and Equian are probably going to acquire or partner with tech companies to build pre-pay capabilities, so that they're not losing out on that shift. We're their customer, Humana is their customer, Anthem's their customer, CVS is their customer, Cigna is their customer. That's their customers' request.

## Client Inquiry

You mentioned Machinify and Lyric, what were the other two that were leading the charge on the AI and pre-payment side?

## Expert Response

Apixio, they just did a merger with New Mountain, I think, for $3 million, a machine learning-focused platform, and then Cotiviti. Those would be my top four. Let me look at our evaluation sheet to see if we got any other smaller start-up ones. We did this at the end of 2024. There may be a little more specialized, but you have, pre-payment, you have like Avanade, which is Accenture Health, they do AI-powered payment solutions through Microsoft partnerships.

CGI Health is another one. DXC Technology is another one that does end-to-end payment integrity. I know there are more specialized, I can't speak to how focused they are on pre-payment. Optum, Inovalon, Verisk Health or Verisk Analytics does predictive modeling for fraud detection and payment accuracy. Once again, how focused are they on pre-pay? I don't know on those.

## Client Follow-Up

Yeah. These are pretty big vendors, and so I'm sure there'll be some kind of upstarts and start-ups that maybe focus on a more narrow initial kind of, even subset of fraud or subrogation. Do big payer organizations ever tend to adopt those types of solutions, or typically leaning on the bigger players in the market?

## Expert Conclusion

It's a good question. I'd love to say that we do. We talk about all the time in meetings that we need to focus on these smaller upstarts because that's really where the value is. I think a lot of times they end up getting gobbled up before they get to like a UHG contract, if that makes sense.

If you're talking more of a regional health payer, mid-level payer, not in those top five MCOs, maybe Humana, I would say not normally. If you looked at Codoxo, Mindshare, Autonomize AI, these would be very smaller emerging pre-pay vendors. There's post-pay ones as well, like ClaimLogiq, RecoveryPro, those ones.

Typically, a large payer with our adoption patterns historically, we run a pilot program with a six- to 12-month pilot that covers a specific region, our product line, and then we'll partner with a more established vendor, like a Cotiviti or an Apixio. Cotiviti or Apixio will integrate that upstart technology rather than a direct adoption. That's typically the way I see it happen.

That's probably due to just things like risk mitigation, compliance, complexity, adoption barriers. A lot of times those startups can't handle the scale that UHG is trying to move at and integrate at. If you're a mid-tier payer, say you have around 500,000-two million members, you're going to be more willing to adopt an upstart solution, or create a proving ground for maybe a more eventual large payer adoption after they've done that for a while.

**Client**
Got it. Some of those start-ups you mentioned were Codoxo, Mindshare.

**Expert**
Codoxo, Autonomize AI. These are more just names that we've seen in this space, we don't have any contractual obligations with them. Mindshare Medical is another one that's specially focused for payment integrity for complex clinical scenarios. Post-pay was ClaimLogiq, and that's an AI-enhanced recovery for complex liability cases. RecoveryPro is a SaaS-based subrogation management for smaller health plans. There are some out there, for certain, that are in that emerging start-up kind of disruptor category.

**Client**
Got it. Thank you for taking the time to speak with me. Have a nice day.
