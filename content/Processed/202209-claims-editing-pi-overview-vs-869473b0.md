## Slide 3: BUSINESS MODELS IN CLAIMS EDITING & PI

**BUSINESS MODELS IN CLAIMS EDITING & PI**

**Business Model Overview**

*   **Primary Claims Editor**
    *   Tends to be a population-based PMPM/SaaS business model
    *   Software automated based on national standardized policies

*   **Secondary Claims Editor**
    *   Tends to be contingency-fee based
    *   Software-enabled, but may require manual review and customization for special edits

*   **Pre-Payment PI**
    *   Tends to be contingency-fee based, moving to SaaS over time
    *   Software-enabled, but contains manual component to review medical records

*   **Post-Payment PI**
    *   Tends to be contingency-fee based
    *   Largely manual verification/collection efforts

**Savings Breakdown & Contingency Fee Model**

| Pass Layer         | Savings by Pass Layer (% of TME) | Revenue Capture (% of Savings) |
| :----------------- | :------------------------------- | :----------------------------- |
| Primary CE Pass    | 4%                               | 2-5% of Savings (0.1-0.2% of TME) |
| First Pass         | 3%                               | 10-15% of Savings (0.3-0.5% of TME) |
| Second Pass        | 2%                               | 20-25% of Savings (0.4-0.5% of TME) |
| Tertiary Pass+     | 1%                               | 30%+ of Savings (0.3% of TME) |

## Slide 4: KEY LEARNINGS FROM PRIMARY RESEARCH (N=10)

**KEY LEARNINGS FROM PRIMARY RESEARCH (N=10)**

*   **PI Shift to Pre-Pay**
    *   Today, the split of savings within PI is ~40% pre-pay / ~60% post-pay vs. it being virtually nonexistent ~5-10 years ago. The recent shift has been entirely driven by demands from end-payor clients
    *   Going forward, as provider abrasion becomes more and more of a focus area due to consolidation, payors will continue to desire limitations of pay & chase. Pre-pay share could grow to ~60% over the next 3-5 years
    *   Post-pay also commands a higher-level of service as they must handle provider communication and relationships with collection agencies

*   **Business Models**
    *   Today, the incumbents generate ~30-40% EBITDA margins across CE/PI, with positive working capital dynamics and limited CapEx / CapSW, leading to FCF margins that are ~80-100% of EBITDA
    *   Payors are starting to consider insourcing components of CE/PI given the significant amount of external payments. Particularly, labor components of PI may be insourced as payors want to own more and more of the communication channel with providers, and would instead prefer SaaS platforms that enable and flag PI
    *   Generally, the underlying growth within the CE/PI space is ~4-6% per year, with minor annual escalators on the licensing side and ~2-3% CPIU + ~1-2% risk on the contingency fee side, coupled with ~flat membership growth in commercial, ~1-3% growth in MMC, and ~3-5% in MA
    *   While gross-churn is limited, there is a reasonable risk of net-churn within the PI space as providers get smarter on areas of savings from the payor lens. Thus, a PI vendor must continue to innovate on rules / clinical policies to refresh savings opportunities on a YoY basis

*   **Automation Opportunity**
    *   The largest drop-off between gross margins of 70-80% is the manual service component required to conduct IBR/chart reviews. If this can be sufficiently automated for a higher % of cases, the steady-state margin could potentially expand into the 50%+ range
    *   Vendors like Machinify who are AI/ML first and healthcare-second have started to struggle in the marketplace. They have the view that the best technology should win, without understand some of the broader KBFs of payors

*   **Tiering Dynamics**
    *   A national health plan will have a plethora of CE/PI vendors. Typically, they vend one primary CE vendor, one secondary CE vendor, and ~3-5 PI vendors on either pre-pay or post-pay. Once you start to go downstream, a regional MCO plan may only have 2-4 vendors total, and a SMID TPA would only have 1-2 vendors
    *   Health plans always tier their savings payments based on the "pass tier;" someone like Optum or ClaimsXten would only receive 1-5% of savings since they do a baseline automated pass. From there, a primary/secondary pass will typically collect 10-25% of savings, with certain tertiary and quaternary players collecting ~30-50%+ of savings

*   **Areas for Innovation**
    *   There exists a significant opportunity to develop FWA solutions targeted towards payments in a VBC setting (vs. FFS). Traditional CE/PI only works in a FFS setting. The only issue with developing VBC-centric FWA solutions is determining who will pay for the service, as FWA in VBC constructs tends to benefit both the provider and payor (e.g., member attribution, risk adjustment)
    *   ClarisHealth acts as a router for the payment integrity stack, providing performance reports. Have succeeded with large health plans who have wide stacks, but have limited penetration within smaller-scale players. Considering an expansion into formal PI through overflow services.
    *   Capabilities that are used in PI such as determining stratifying bills / claims by denial likelihood can also be deployed to providers to provide visibility into likelihood of paid vs. billed amounts. An RCM solution like Anomaly can then help providers to optimize collections upfront (vs. post-pay disputes)
    *   There also exists an opportunity to expand into the Rx side (vs. just medical), but penetration here is limited with Cotiviti having a head start

*   **Competitive Considerations**
    *   Fundamentally, no one is going to disrupt the primary claims editing landscape. ClaimsXten and Optum CES own ~90% of the market, and have never churned a customer historically. Similarly, Cotiviti along with Change owns ~80% of the PI market, particularly in the post-pay setting
    *   Zelis is rapidly expanding and capturing the mid-size TPA and regional MCO space. Historically been an untapped market with low service levels from incumbents as they simply viewed the CAC as too high

*   **Go-To-Market Considerations**
    *   Change has historically suffered with RCM churn due to conflicts of interest where it was the PI vendor and the RCM vendor for the provider in disputes. This could pose a risk to a player like Anomaly as they scale
    *   Selling to providers tends to have longer sales cycle and lower ACVs due to higher fragmentation. In contrast, selling to payors results in customer concentration risk (albeit with low churn)
    *   Going after the long-tail of Blues is also attractive since they are traditionally ignored by the large incumbents, and there is significant word-of-mouth opportunity through the BCBSA

## Slide 5: KEY BUYING FACTORS FOR CE/PI SOLUTIONS

**KEY BUYING FACTORS FOR CE/PI SOLUTIONS**

**Importance to Customers**

1.  **Savings Opportunity:** Ability to deliver medical cost savings, appropriate for the pass-level it is tiered at. Typically, the more back-ended the pass is, the lower the savings opportunity, but the higher the revenue capture for the end CE/PI vendor
2.  **Ability to Prove ROI:** Particularly for pre-pay or secondary claims editing solutions, it is difficult to prove "hard" savings since it is more of an avoided cost than direct recovery. Vendor needs to be able to plug into claims section and directly show difference between claims allowed vs. claims paid
3.  **Provider Abrasion:** Given ongoing consolidation of provider groups and health systems, payors are increasingly less willing to resolve post-pay disputes with providers due to abrasion caused, leading to negotiations where providers threaten OON status
4.  **Innovation in Models:** As RCM vendors start to support providers in assessing claims denial rates, historical CE/PI models start to be deprecated for the payor. Thus, continuously identifying new medical / UM policies to contain cost are a critical focus area for payors
5.  **Time to Adjudication:** Ideally, payors would like to also minimize times to payment back to providers due to the friction caused. Solutions that are enabled by OCR, NLP, and AI can potentially reduce service-level times beyond that of incumbents
6.  **Labor Service Levels:** Payors typically seek outsourcing of manual labor required to support claims/chart/bill reviews (pre-pay and post-pay) in addition to provider recovery in a post-pay setting
7.  **Business Model Flexibility:** As payors are shifting their payment integrity strategy to be more pre-pay, payors are seeking SaaS-based business models with a fixed license or PMPM fee vs. contingency fee models given increasing overlap of claimed savings
8.  **Back-end Integration:** Baseline requirement includes integration into claims, medical records, billing, ERP, and UM policy data feeds

**Potential Thesis**

✓ Large SAM ($3B) in regional MCOs, middle-market TPAs, and stop-loss carriers market, with expansion opportunities into the commercial, MCO, and MA markets. Path to achieve SAM is clear, and model could potentially expand upstream if savings opportunity is compelling
✓ Movement of PI upstream to pre-payment. Payors are increasingly seeking pre-pay solutions to limit provider abrasion from pay & chase methods. Market is now ~40% pre-pay (from <10% 5 years ago), and is projected to grow to 60% over the next 5 years
✓ Sustainable SaaS revenue model. Alaffia is well equipped to succeed due to its focus on structuring SaaS contracts, a model payors are increasingly seeking due to "softness" of pre-pay savings
✓ Attractive margin structure. Incumbents have provided evidence that scaled CE/PI players can achieve ~30-40%+ EBITDA margins (with positive below-the-line cash flow dynamics). OCR, NLP, and automation tech can further expand future margins to ~50%+
✓ Strong team with early traction and strategic vision: Alaffia netted $450k in revenue for Q2 and currently has a >$2mm in run-rate. In the long term, the team has the potential to move further downstream and generate expansion revenue

**Key Risks**

× Competitive intensity from Zelis. Zelis' core focus area is within TPAs and MCOs, achieving ~$1B in revenue. Meaningful risk that Zelis dominates the segment of the market Alaffia is after
× Limited unicorn potential. Due to the strong stickiness of incumbents (~99-100% gross retention on a membership basis), Alaffia's SAM is fundamentally limited to 50-60M lives
× Commercial considerations. While TJ and Adun have personal experience in PI, they are still early in their careers, which may limit commercial opportunity with potential customers
× Buildout of AI/automation. Full automation of IBR / chart review is still pending. Need to assess how truly automated vs. manual the business can be in steady-stage
