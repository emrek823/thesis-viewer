### Background & Team

- Elizabeth Duffield
	- Healthcare technology startups background (seed through Series B)
	- Enterprise sales experience (hospitals and health plans)
	- Ribbon Health: first enterprise sales hire, built SWAT team for up-market pivot
	- Closed 3 health plans, 1 system in 2023 for $8M+ revenue
	- Led sales and marketing teams post-acquisition
- Akash
	- Data scientist background, clinical decision support (oncology)
	- Early Ribbon employee, led product deployment and product teams
	- Medallion: led AI automation, increased gross margins 70% in 1.5 years
	- Super bullish on starting own thing with AI-native approach
- 9.5 years partnership history, timing feels right with technology advances

### Problem & Solution Focus

- Initial exploration: rural hospitals closing at record rates
	- Too big/complex problem for startup impact
	- Policy challenges, limited budget for solutions even if revenue-positive
- Pivot to discharge process inefficiencies
	- Length of stay (LOS) reduction as top 2-3 priority for executives
	- Revenue impact: ~$15K per admission, 200-bed hospital with 0.5 day excess LOS = 7-8 figure losses
	- Clear attribution to revenue/savings makes compelling sales case
- MVP: Better referral platform acute to post-acute care
	- Drive revenue for hospitals through faster discharges
	- Monetization path for post-acute providers (occupancy = revenue)
	- Distribution channel ownership creates data moat and product stickiness

### Market Strategy & Vision

- Payer integration pathway
	- Start with referral platform, collect outcomes data
	- Analytics play for providers and payers (readmission rates, transition performance)
	- Long-term: become payer TCM model (Navi Health 2.0 approach)
- Expansion opportunities
	- Home health growth (30% expected over 10 years)
	- Post-acute to post-acute referrals (SNF to home health)
	- Site neutral payment environment advantages
- Geographic density building important for payer partnerships

### Current Status & Next Steps

- 45+ discovery conversations completed (80-85% consistent themes)
- Moving to design partnership phase
- Seeking 3 design partners from health systems
- Need clinical/quality leadership introductions
- Fundraising timeline: post design partner commitments
- Hiring priority: founding engineer (product-minded, user interview capable)
- Follow-up meeting planned with Sean Doolan when available
