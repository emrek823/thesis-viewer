**Q: Q. What is your title and role within your organization?**

A: Senior Director Product Development at Elevance Health Inc.

**Q: Q.How long have you been in the industry? Describe your organization briefly - how big is it in terms of members or revenue?**

A: I've been in the industry for 20 years or so.

**Client**
Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today about HealthEdge. To start off, could you please give me a quick overview of your background and experience?

**Expert**
Been in this healthcare space industry about 20, 22, 23 years. Started off, cut my teeth at CVS, actually working in the IT department. Primary responsibility was overseeing SharePoint but because of the PBM space also traversed through adjudication platforms, encounters, etc. We use TriZetto. I think was one of the first systems that we were using at that point. RxClaim was another adjudication platform that we're using at that point.

Moved out of that, fast forward, took a different path, moved more into strategy and operations. I was at CVS for about 12, 13 years. Left, went to Aetna for about three years. Left that, went to a regional Ohio company called Medical Mutual. Actually, at Medical Mutual we used AssureCare, we used their MedCompass product and then left that.

Two years ago, I moved to Elevance where my responsibility at Elevance is I oversee national product strategy for all commercial insurance plans, Medicare, Medicare Advantage, Medicaid, and special needs. My breadth of influence goes from vendor partnerships, software to tools that we utilize for provider credentialing, provider accreditation, claims payment, call center, etc.

Now, recently as of the January 1st, I've took over responsibility of Mosaic, which is a new company that we just launched that is more targeted towards special needs care management. With that, we're essentially building a best case. We're using that company as a sandbox essentially for all of the things that we need to do or want to do for a member journey, especially folks with chronic conditions.

That includes solving for platforms that have interaction either with the provider, with a hospital with a member for the full scope. We're looking at claims, payment, we're looking at eligibility, we're looking at summary of benefits, we're looking at accreditation of provider on the provider side, we're looking at paying the providers as well. We're looking at trying to build in quality incentives, quality models into those provider spaces, etc. The digital side as well with the engagement piece. I do a lot, I've done a lot, still doing a lot.

**Client**
Very interesting. You're in a great place to opine on who's who in CAPS and the related modules. In your mind, what's the landscape of vendors that are serving CAPS and the additional modules that HealthEdge talks about, so member management, provider management? What's the landscape for vendors and how would you compare them against each other?

**Expert**
I think as an old-school health person, I grew up on TriZetto. It had its shortfalls. It was a very slow adopter as a system, as a tool, whereas HealthEdge came in, shiny new toy, everything figured out for the most part. The problem with the space in general is you've got all of these solutions that claim to do the same thing, and they do for the most part, but the users, the folks that are actually going to leverage a lot of these

events are going to differ.

A TriZetto and a HealthEdge are typically the tools that you're going to find being used by most of the bigger entities, bigger companies, just because of one) cost, two) scale. You're not finding a regional insurance company using something along those lines. Medical Mutual, I know Paramount, I know a couple of other ones who use AssureCare's product because it was simpler and it was also cheaper.

There is a lot to that space that can just become overwhelming when it's not something that you necessarily need to do. If you don't have a national contract, you don't need to have national access to providers. You don't need to have national access to hospital systems. You don't need to have a broad-scale cube on the EHR for that kind of volume because that is not something that you necessarily care for. Unfortunately, the issue that I did find with the HealthEdge and the TriZettos is scaling down was not a thing that they necessarily could do easily.

However, their end suite, their core admin processing, the claims administration platform is pretty decent. If we were to go line by line, because if we're talking scale, I'll compare HealthEdge and TriZetto. I think those are the two that probably have the biggest reach and the most close similarity. I think, in terms of claims management, HealthEdge has really stepped up to it. Internal payer systems to hospital systems, to individual providers, I think their solution is pretty okay.

I just think where TriZetto has maybe the leg up is just longevity. They've been in the industry. They've cultivated a lot of these relationships historically. We have evolved. When CMS threw sanctions to CVS, TriZetto was in the trenches with us, figuring out how we could open up our throughput for encounter data, how we can open up our throughput for enrollment. Ultimately, those were part of the pieces that they ended up building into their payer connections on their claims management side.

**Client**
Can you expand on that point you just made that HealthEdge is really good at claims management, but on some of the other pieces, they are more commoditized?

**Expert**
I think HealthEdge is nimble. If you need to set up, say a new line of business or a new relationship, new contract with a new clinic or you have, say, Cleveland Clinic, I'm talking Ohio right now, Cleveland Clinic has just offloaded a couple of provider entities. I'm Elevance and I'm using HealthEdge. I need to now create these new contracts with these provider entities that are no longer affiliated with or that no longer fall under the TIN for Cleveland Clinic. They have their own individual TIN. That's a press of a button and an entry of three spaces with HealthEdge.

It creates the platform by which the claims can be paid, providers can submit. It's a very, very seamless process to establish all of those pieces to create those tie-ins. There's no submission of five volumes of paperwork. You put in an entry to create a new provider group. Provider goes in and puts in their TIN. All of that gets approved within five minutes. You have a connection between Dr. J, who is now down the street instead of part of Cleveland Clinic's TIN and myself that is the payer that's paying those claims. It's that simple. They have that piece figured out.

**Client**
What would that look like with TriZetto, for example?

**Expert**
I think TriZetto is a little more complicated. This is where I think the difference is. If it's a provider that was previously accredited even under a global TIN, if that provider is going to their own entity, they still have to go through a new accreditation with TriZetto. It's not letting the previous accreditation carry through for that new provider connection. They may have changed it, but that was one thing that we used to have issues when I was at Medical Mutual with the TriZetto product.

Interesting. Is that a function of HealthEdge being more cloud-based or what would you attribute?

**Expert**
It is. I think it is also a function of HealthEdge be more cloud-based for sure. Now that you say that, the cloud-based piece, that's primarily just all the storage. It still has to essentially check that record, that doctor's NPI number against something. I don't know if it's just a smarter technology on HealthEdge's side that assumes, calculates that because there's no record that's come up in CMS saying, "This person is under suspension or their license has been held. For as long as those values still stand correct, it still is able to recognize that as a valid provider without necessarily having to do anything else.

Either their API is very good, whatever, AI, API that they use to do this continuous verification accreditation, credentialing, it's smart enough to carry on those relationships, whereas for TriZetto, I think by now, TriZetto should also be some way cloud-based. I can't imagine they're still maintaining service systems. I just don't think their workflows are that smart currently or maybe at least currently as of two years ago.

They were not that smart to recognize that Dr. X, that was with Cleveland Clinic, that is now an independent provider, is still Dr. X, still retains the same license, has no issues on record with CMS and is still an accredited doctor. Ergo, we can create a connection with that doctor for him to submit J-codes for payment and all that stuff. It was very cumbersome with TriZetto.

**Client**
Yes. You mentioned that maybe some smaller regional payers would use something called AssureCare. Who are the other relevant vendors?

**Expert**
Arcadia, I think EviCore are the ones that probably I would call reliable, especially for smaller size. Cohere, though I think Cohere over the last two, maybe three years, they've started leaning more towards UM versus full solutions. I think they have decided they're going to leverage just the UM piece and make that a smarter and essentially double down on utilization management instead of having a payer care solution.

I think for sure Cohere is a good one. AssureCare, their MedCompass product is really, really good. I do wish that was a product that could have been or that could gain enough popularity to scale up. I don't know that they have the capacity, I don't know if they wants to even scale up. They feature very comfortably in that middle mid-market segment. I don't know that they necessarily want to go any bigger.

**Client**
Interesting. How much of the market would you say is that mid-market in terms of payer claim share, whatever the right way is to segment the market? How much is mid-market below versus enterprise and above?

**Expert**
Versus enterprise, I think it's actually bigger than people give it credit for. I think the illusion of Elevance, Humana, UnitedHealthcare, what are the big ones, those are the big ones that I can think of right now. Yes, they are the dominant pieces on a national scale. However, if we look at just say Ohio for example, if we look at enrollment in Ohio, the value to the national payers is because they have a Medicaid product, they have a Medicare product. They also have commercial lives, they may have some union lives.

On the whole in Ohio, it will seem like they have a very large enrollment population. However, if you look at Medical Mutual of Ohio, which is purely an Ohio regional company, you look at SummaCare in Ohio, which is another purely regional, if we were to look at Medicare Advantage lives, they actually have a higher enrollment count than a lot of the big players. This is a feature that is now starting to set in in a lot of these entities nationwide.

I know for Ohio, it's the case. I know Florida is insane with small, middle-sized payers because what they have that the big ones do not have is they have the boots on the ground. They have people that are connected to the folks that need help. They have people that live right in some of these areas where they're

covering. When it's a decision for a member on who to enroll with, it is not a broker that is reaching out to these members, it is the friend that works for the company that's saying, "Hey, this is the same company that I work for. They take care of me. Sign up for them." Especially right now, that is starting to take on a new level of significance in the healthcare space.

Those companies are bubbling and they're pulling membership and they're offering things that, as enterprises, we can't compete with. One of my issues right now is with California. Outside of L.A.O.C., I get in L.A., I can offer anything, everything. Once we start looking outside of L.A.O.C., I'm struggling because I don't have enough people. For if we're looking at D-SNP product, I don't have enough people to do the driving to go look at D-SNP members. I don't have enough partnerships with I-SNP, with institutions for me to have nurse practitioners go visit institutions to go see my members.

Ultimately, my members end up suffering and all my members end up jumping to the Alignments of the world because those are smaller, they're more nimble. They have a person everywhere because it is a grassroots, started-from-the-ground kind of entity and they are killing it. They've got partnerships with these other start-ups that are very high touch that make it easier for them to roll out their strategies and execute their strategies pretty easily.

**Client**
Meaning because they're local, they can agglomerate better networks.

**Expert**
Yes. Enterprise, we're in for a rude awakening very soon.

**Client**
Interesting. Some of the other vendors that you mentioned, like AssureCare, EviCore, Cohere, my sense was that these weren't full CAPS systems, they were more utilization management, care coordination, certain aspects of payer systems, but not really full solutions. Can you just expand on that? Are these really HealthEdge competitors or they're modules that sit on top of homegrown systems?

**Expert**
Yes. In simple terms, you can look at HealthEdge as a conglomeration of multiple modules. GuidingCare, which is the care management piece. HealthRules, which is the administration. You've got the Payment Integrity, you've got the Member Experience. A lot of these other entities, really they started off as very simplified solutions, utilization management, care management, member experience.

Based on opportunities and because they're also probably partnered with a lot of these smaller regional, it's easy to expand from just pure utilization management to prior authorization to some element of care management. If your volume is only going to require you to add maybe 10 more employees, it's much easier to make that expansion versus the HealthEdges, the TriZettos that have ingrained multi-solutions that are already scaled.

I think part of the thing is the Coheres, the AssureCares, they were very much homegrown, single-state solutions that have dabbled in other things to some level of success, to some level of failure and ultimately have decided to either scale back down to what they think is what they know and what they do well and/or leave little tethers with MedCompass. I think Medical Mutual used their MedCompass. We use the Med Compass solution for pretty much everything, pop health, care management, UM, QM, pharmacy provider services. We use that MedCompass product for a lot.

At the same time, I don't necessarily think that if we were to try and take that MedCompass product and put it at an Elevance, MedCompass or AssureCare would need to scale up a lot to be able to handle the demand that we have as a two million-, three million-, four million-member entity with over a 500,000 providers in our networks with just those two pieces.

**Client**
Okay. Can you just expand on that? AssureCare, is the reason that they can't serve Elevance because the

platform isn't as scalable or is it that it's not a CAPS provider, it's a care management, utilization management system that you'd need in addition to CAPS?

**Expert**
No. It's a CAP solution. It's just not scaled to the level that Elevance would need. If you think of my portfolio of products at Elevance, I'll put Elevance side by side with Medical Mutual because I have history with both. I've worked at both ends. I own product on both ends. For Elevance, I have about three million, 3.5 million members spread between Medicare Advantage, Medicaid, special needs. I'm not even including my commercial, my union, my employer groups. This is just purely the older population.

Medical Mutual, my total enrollment lives was probably about 50,000, maybe 60,000, all essentially just in Medicare Advantage. Maybe if we go broad, we can give them 100,000 or 200,000 in their commercial space. If we just look at then the scale of numbers, pure numbers, all concentrated in Ohio versus, I'm talking national scale, what then that means for me as a national provider is every major provider entity in the country, I need to either have as part of my network internal or they need to be part of my expanding network.

**Client**
If you had to divide the industry in terms of lives or claims between the HealthEdge, TriZetto segment, more expensive, more comprehensive, better scale versus the mid-market below, what order of magnitude are we talking about? How many lives are in the HealthEdge segment versus the rest?

**Expert**
Currently, I'll probably say HealthEdge, TriZetto may have about 60%-65%.

**Client**
Got it. Within that 60%-65%, how much is vended a HealthEdge and a TriZetto and whoever else is worth mentioning and how much is of internal systems built by the carriers themselves?

**Expert**
I think a lot of companies are getting away from building internal systems, to be honest, especially large-scale full CAP products like this because it's way more work than it's worth. When you can partner with a HealthEdge and it's a turnkey solution, you can partner with a TriZetto and it's a turnkey solution, why bother spending the extra couple million on building, maintaining, and needing to hold the responsibility of refreshing. A lot of companies have moved away.

This is why HealthEdge and TriZetto have essentially taken the big market is because when CVS decided to turn back from the outsourcing for the RxClaim product 10, 15 years ago, these were turnkey solutions that they could essentially press a button, bring in, and connect to within a day, a week and do maybe a six-month runout where you're checking and testing and making sure claims are going the same way, getting paid the same way on both systems. You could do all of those things with very little attrition. To your question, I think the idea of homegrown solutions, that is slowly starting to move away because it is not worth the cost and the expense.

**Client**
How much of that is left?

**Expert**
That's where I was going. I do think there are some legacy systems that are still there. I'll maybe give them a 5% ownership of that market space. I couldn't tell you of any, and I've worked or interacted with and I talked to a lot of people in the industry, I know we're all using roundabout the same things. We all look at, we all leverage, we all talk to the same vendors.

I would say at most, 5% of the market space and probably in the mid-market versus enterprise, it's more of the smaller entities that are probably still using some level of homegrown product versus enterprise. That's

probably fully transitioned into large scale.

**Client**
Interesting. You're saying among large payers, it's at this point fully vended.

**Expert**
Yes. I don't know how much exposure you guys have with the payer space and how much of a pain in the ass it is to manage my board, manage my executive leadership team and then to also be trying to interact with my IT team on solving for either member-facing, provider-facing, member experience solutions on each of those. I don't have enough hours in a day.

There's two of us that do what I do in Elevance. I can't spend that much time trying to make sure every new provider that's coming into network is connected, is accredited, is credentialed and I can pay their claims and they can submit claims if they see my members. My homegrown solution is not going to be able to keep up with it. I need someone else to just take care of that.

Essentially, when that provider is in-network, they're submitting that claims through them. As long as it checks off, it comes to me as, "Hey, it's just hitting my accounts payable." I don't want to deal with it. If there is a change, if CMS or the federal government makes a change, my IT folks, by the time I receive that message, have conversations with my IT team, maybe then leverage a team in India that's doing some low-level programming to then have that program coded, put in a sandbox, a semi-production entity to be tested, to then be rolled live. We're wasting time and money that I just don't have.

For me, it's much easier to just have the health agents of the world that just come in and say, "Hey. We'll take care of it. You just pay us X amount of dollars and we'll take care of everything for you. You can focus purely on the service that you're providing to your members."

**Client**
Other points of differentiation worth mentioning between, say, HealthEdge and TriZetto?

**Expert**
The biggest differentiation point with HealthEdge versus Trizetto, I think, the analytics. I used to get a lot more reports on what, which, where from HealthEdge than I did with TriZetto, rejected claims, pended claims, claims that were submitted incorrectly. This is the thing with the HealthEdge system too that I really do like.

Say a member goes to see a doctor. You have, let's say, diabetes. You had an amputation for diabetes or from diabetes. A doctor only submits a J-code for the amputation. HealthEdge's system is smart enough to also then give me the codes that align with other conditions, your diabetic conditions. You also need to be getting medication for diabetes, your A1c and all that stuff in addition to the procedure that you just went through. HealthEdge does that.

We have to do a redetermination every two years with the government where we essentially look at all the claims that we have submitted to the government for Medicare, Medicaid and essentially rerun them and that test that these are accurate. HealthEdge takes away from me having to spend resources doing that redetermination because they're catching probably 95% of all applicable J-codes on first submission. That is a big deal.

**Client**
Meaning HealthEdge will help you figure out that that person needs to be steered toward medication in order to avoid readmission and other kind of avoidable healthcare costs.

**Expert**
Yes. HealthEdge is essentially telling me that on top of this procedure that member also had, they still have one, two, three things that are also conditions that need to be managed, need to be watched for. My care

management team already then has a leg up. They're looking and reaching out to the member preemptively to say, "Hey, we noticed you just visited, but we're also seeing you have this, this, this. Would you like to schedule a follow-up? Would you like to go into a clinic? Would you like to sign up for our chronic care management program?"

It gives us enough data that we can make those intelligent follow-up conversations with members before these turn into acute care situations where a member then gets readmitted and now we're faced with another $100,000 bill for something that could've been avoided.

**Client**
Right. What's your view on HealthEdge's right to play in these other modules that they acquired, so member management, provider management, benefits administration? How well integrated is that into the core CAPS product and how likely is a payer to adopt those if they're on CAPS?

**Expert**
Your first phrase right to play, I think they have made the right amount of noise to promote their product, to showcase what they do. I think the one thing with HealthEdge is product portfolio. I don't think it's there yet. What's it called? The wall frame, the member experience solution, I don't think it's necessarily caught up to where I think TriZetto's solution is for member experience.

As far as patient, if we're looking at patient engagement and with that, we're not just talking about what a member is seeing or getting when they get to a provider. At least I'm looking at verifying eligibility as a starter, determining coverage, being able to communicate to a member what all is covered by the insurance, what do they get, do they get transportation, do they get a free home assessment for risk fall, those kind of things. I'm looking at simplifying the prior authorization processes. That is an attrition area for us. I think HealthEdge still has some ways to go in that helping members understand their financial commitments, their burden.

We're all trying to solve for out of pocket. There's some solutions that are helping and showing members and I think HealthEdge now actually does show real-time member costs for some services. I just don't think it's necessarily as caught up to where some of the other market players are. I think that is an area where personally I'm not looking at HealthEdge as a solution for me on a member experience perspective.

**Client**
Got it. What about provider management, billing and payments, benefits administration?

**Expert**
I think for the provider, their provider solution is actually really, really good. Now, I think part of the great thing about it is, to your earlier point, I don't know whether it being cloud-based is necessarily the reason for the advantage or if they have just thought enough through all of the touch points on a commercial, on a Medicare, on a Medicaid, in terms of the platform, in terms of the ecosystem, in terms of analytics, in terms of just reimbursement. I think they have done a good job on that end.

I think they could do a better job on denials management, at least on the payment side, claims denied, claims rejected. I think that is really a big piece for us too. Overall, I do think HealthEdge has something. Their solution is dynamic. Here's the baseline, the ability to have contracts in HealthEdge and have those contracts be used to build workflows on payments, payments to providers, etc., I think that is a game changer across industry. Not a lot of people are doing that.

You're still seeing a lot of payers are still taking contracts, breaking them down into accounts payable and then accounts payable is where you're creating these workflows where if you have value-based agreements, there's a trigger that needs to be set off. I think HealthEdge has figured out how to essentially take that contract, break it down to key points, and have those key points be the ones that drive workflows and call outs for payment reimbursement claims hold.

I think they still have a little bit of work to do on the rejection and denials part, especially, what, with two

years off of Change Health being hacked. A lot of us were using a third party for any claims that were coming in. They would essentially see the approvals. The denials would get the approvals, all the denials, send them back if they needed to be reworked. If they were missing things, the Change would essentially hold those and take care of them. We have since had to address that solution because of how vulnerable it is and how much it brought essentially most of healthcare to its knees when it happened. This is where these solutions can come in and really plug in a gap.

**Client**
Can you expand on the workflow that you just described that HealthEdge is really differentiated at, so just integrating payments and accounts payables with the underlying contract structure? Can you just dig into that and then how would that look in HealthEdge versus a TriZetto?

**Expert**
Yes. Let's look at Medicare because there's a fee schedule with Medicare. In HealthEdge, they are able to take, update, maintain the CMS fee schedule top line and any regulatory updates that may happen to that fee schedule for conditions, for criteria, etc.

How they do it or the technology associated with it, I couldn't tell you. However, what I do know is they can take that schedule and stand it side by side with say a value-based contract or a fee-for-service contract or any contract we have with the provider and align payment terms.

If we're saying to University Hospitals, "We're paying you upfront, we're paying you 95% of Medicare and then we have a 3% bonus kicker," HealthEdge, the system is able to align what that means based on that fee schedule that they're pulling from CMS. When the payment needs to happen, there is no additional manual interaction that's done.

It is checking what the number is, what the contract is, kicking off a workflow that is tied into our accounts payable, and that then kicks off a check being produced that gets directly inputted ACH into the hospital's account. It is cool. I've come from a generation in this industry where you get a fax copy of a claim from a doctor. That fax copy gets reviewed by a claims person. When that claims person signs off on it, it then gets routed to the finance office.

The finance office reviews, pulls down whatever contract terms, whatever data with CMS and then essentially puts a note right on what that means, sends that over to accounts payable. Accounts payable then takes it, inputs it into an Excel spreadsheet and then cuts the check. That check then takes two to four days to then be mailed to the provider for them to then go and deposit that check. The process has gone from a two-week lag to probably a 20-minute event.

**Client**
How different does that look in TriZetto for example?

**Expert**
I think TriZetto is not far back. I think with TriZetto, they still pull down CMS schedule data. For the contract terms and the contract languages, I think there is still old members. I would still have to go into TriZetto and set those parameters in TriZetto for it to be able to do the analysis of the comparison. I don't think it's necessarily as seamless as it is on the HealthEdge side.

I think there is still a certain amount of manual interaction, manual intervention by me as the contract owner to make sure I'm inputting the contract terms that I have with university hospitals, Cleveland Clinic for it then to take those and put them side by side with the CMS contract.

As far as the downstream process with those contracts, I think it is now a day-long process. I think there is still a workflow that connects to accounts payable, accounts receivable. I think there is still someone that has to go in and click a button. It is not preemptively doing all of these things and sends you a report saying, "This is what we did." Why? There's still some level of intervention on each track.

**Client**
Yes. How painful is it to change one of these systems? How often do you consider changing out the CAPS or these other modules? How big of a discount or capability difference would it require for you to consider ripping out HealthEdge? How difficult is that to do?

**Expert**
Somebody would have had to have been killed. Cost is a big deal. I think as Elevance, we have the advantage of volume so we can negotiate down a lot of our deals. If TriZetto were to come in and give me most of what I get with HealthEdge and give me a 25%, 30% discount, I would absolutely consider it. Now, would I actually end up pulling the plug or would I try and use that with HealthEdge to just leverage a better deal? Probably looking at trying to use that to leverage a better deal with HealthEdge.

I think the problem with these full-suite services is it's essentially plugged into everything that I do on a member perspective, on a vendor perspective, on the EMR that I'm using, on the providers that I have in my network. The attrition is not just turning off that service, it is turning off that service and also then needing to have an alternative solution for the providers at my network to then connect to immediately for them to continue doing their job. That's not always easy because it's not just a process of inputting your NPI and clicking a button and you're automatically accredited. It's like doing a background check.

I have now done so much with HealthEdge to do the accreditation, to do the credentialing, to do the claims payment, to manage my integrity, to manage my UM cycle, to manage my CM cycle, to manage my prioritization cycle that if I were to pull the plug on that, not only do I need to have a ready-made solution that's already next to it running and doing the same thing, but I need to also then have a whole facility set up for when issues happen. They do because not all hospital systems are the same, not all provider systems are the same, not all claims payment tools are the same. We know very well that not all EMR systems are the same.

You got Athena, you got Epic, you have got two, three different systems being used by a lot of the hospital systems and they are all connecting to these same tools. To answer your question, it would require a significant, significant reason for me to decide to move, out much rather try and negotiate, negotiate, and negotiate with current than move. Unless something drastic has happened.

If there is an ethical thing going on or there is a risk to my members, to my providers or they're selling my data, something like that, it has to be like that kind of a situation of which at that point, I think the need to have a ready-made solution goes out the door. It's how many gaps can I plug in with what I have and how much time do I have to figure out the rest of the things.

**Client**
Yes. That being said, at the same time it seems like everyone has sort of moved off of the homegrown solutions that arguably were sticky for the same reasons.

**Expert**
Yes. I think that's absolutely what it is. The homegrown solutions were great when the industry was still learning and the industry was still growing, adapting, figuring out how to do some of these things in the most efficient way. Now, there is some standardization, some level of knowledge and education that's there and you're seeing and then the security piece also with cloud-based solutions. A lot of entities are realizing just how much better things are and things can be whilst we move or at least enough for us to make the move.

Another thing being a lot of us, especially the enterprise payers, for the longest time, we had three, four, five solutions doing different things. On my end, that means my vendor team has to manage a vendor that's doing care management. My vendor team has to manage a vendor that's doing claims payment, that's doing quality management, that's doing etc., whereas with some of these solutions, I just need one person that oversees that relationship.

Once a year I'm expected to go in and say "Hey, are they meeting your needs? If they're not, what would you like to see different?" I put that into our procurement system. My vendor person takes that and meets with the solution person at HealthEdge. They come up with a decision on whether this is a critical need that needs

to be solved for or if there is a solution that already exists that they can substitute in to get me what I need to do my job or get my keep things moving.

Payers are certainly moving towards these one-stop solutions just because they are easier on us resource-wise and they just make things much, much easier. I don't know what it is for you guys on the PA side. On our side, we're struggling to find people to do work in general.

**Client**
Yes. You say that there used to be three to five solutions. Is that three to five solutions that aggregate into a CAP system, or you're saying you used to have one CAP system and one provider system?

**Expert**
No. HealthEdge essentially took all of those individual solutions, aggregated them into one. You sign a contract with HealthEdge, you get access to all of their solutions. You sign a contract with TriZetto, you get access to the aggregate of solutions that they have. Twenty years ago, I would have had a contract with four or five different vendors. To give you an example, I would've had a contract with probably two entities to manage a care management solution. I would've probably had maybe two or three for claims administration or core administration. I would've maybe had two or three for payment integrity.

**Client**
Yes. Are all those today considered CAPS, or are some of those the other HealthEdge modules, so care management?

**Expert**
They are considered CAPS.

**Client**
Okay. How valuable is it having one vendor do the other stuff too? When HealthEdge comes and tries to cross-sell you their provider management module in addition to the CAPS system, how compelling is that?

**Expert**
It is. Personally, I think that is a leg up at least for me. I think given the size of the company that I work for and the number of things that my hands are already involved in, the last thing that I want to also be doing is, I mentioned this earlier on, I only have so many hours in a day. I have two kids, I have a wife, I have a life. I'm already seeing myself working 10-, 12-hour days. Three of those hours are all administrative.

Now, if I have a single solution that has a compelling enough suite of products that can eliminate a lot of administrative burden on my end, also eliminate a lot of resource churn on my end. A HealthEdge solution also then means I have less people that need to handhold specific vendors. I have less people that need to be auditing multiple vendors. There's a lot of downstream implications then on having a single-stop solution because it also eases the burden, also financial burden on my end. I have people that I can dedicate to other things than essentially audit, vendor management, etc.

In this day and age, I am more likely to engage in conversations with vendors that are coming to me saying, "Hey. We are good at this or we are very, very good at this. We're also pretty good at all of these other things. We know you have a need because you're a payer. You're an insurance company, you have a need for marketing material or this or that. We have a very good process that solves for all of those." For me, it's a very fine line. Some of these companies then get too big that you can't have conversations with them. For me, if there is a problem, I talk to one person about my problem and we solve that problem. This is what you get by these companies.

**Client**
Great. This was helpful. Thank you for your time. Enjoy the rest of your day.
