What You Should Know:

– The model is designed to generate high-quality real-world data (RWD) for conditions like Parkinson’s and autoimmune disorders while imposing zero administrative burden on care providers.

How WellSky and uMed Are Bringing Clinical Trials into the Living Room

The collaboration marries WellSky’s massive provider network—spanning more than 10,000 home-based care providers—with uMed’s ACCESS Cohorts, an automated platform designed to build patient registries at scale.

The “Zero-Friction” Model

This partnership addresses that friction through automation. The initiative begins with a simple Registry Participation Agreement. Once signed, uMed takes the wheel, managing patient identification, outreach, consent, and support.

“Partnering with WellSky allows us to reach patients where they are—at home—while ensuring the process is seamless for clinical teams,” said Matt Wilson, MD, founder and CEO of uMed.

Targeting the “Hard-to-Reach”

The clinical focus of this rollout targets complex therapeutic areas including Parkinson’s disease, cardiometabolic conditions, and autoimmune disorders. These are conditions where longitudinal, real-world data (RWD) regarding medication usability and treatment preferences is incredibly valuable but difficult to capture outside of clinical appointments.

Bill Miller, Chairman and CEO of WellSky, emphasized that this is an infrastructure play designed to close the equity gap.
