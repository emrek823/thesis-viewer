### PathAI and Valo Business Model Discussion

- Traditional pharma partnerships create fundamental misalignment
	- What pharma wants vs what companies offer differs significantly
	- Translation challenges on both sides
	- Difficulty closing deals without degenerating into services business

### Two Spectrum Approaches in Life Sciences AI

- Palantir-style rapid deployment model
	- Ex-Palantir healthcare team formed mini-Palantir for biopharma
	- Structured NIH partnerships providing non-dilutive capital
	- Distribution through 10-15 health systems
	- Rapid product development cycles (weeks vs years)
		- Friday customer feedback → Monday demo with real functionality
		- Examples: pharmacy benefit verification, specialty pharmacy hubs, 340B contract pharmacy engagement
	- Bootstrap approach with government funding
- Deep tech consulting approach (Standard Model Bio)
	- Former BMS head of data science leading outsourced data science for pharma
	- Data science teams now have real budget (vs performative 5-10 years ago)
	- 7-figure contracts with consulting-heavy model
	- Goal: create true digital twin for patient modeling
		- Patient stratification optimization
		- Clinical trial biomarker development
		- BD/M&A decision support
	- Example impact: PD-1/PD-L1 biomarker threshold changes = $20-30B lifetime drug value difference (Opdivo vs Keytruda)

### Current Market Opportunity

- High-margin window still available for next 2-3 years
- Strong demand for AI/data science expertise in healthcare
- Fine-tuning vision language models for biological applications
- Addressing lack of comprehensive biology models

### Next Steps

- Emre meeting Standard Model Bio CEO Kevin on Wednesday for whiteboarding session
- Potential investment discussion ($1-1.5M raise)
- Staying connected for Boston visit in next two weeks
- Mutual introductions and deal flow sharing
