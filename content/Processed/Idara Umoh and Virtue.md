### Background & Experience

- Started in public service at Department of Labor as economist
- Worked in think tanks on tax policy, Medicare, Medicaid, dual eligibles
- Joined Obama administration as career official, then political role leading social impact investing
- Got MBA from Kellogg (executive program)
- Led customer success at Dispatch Health (grew team 0 to 15, managed top accounts including MultiCare and Texas Health Resources)

### Previous Role at OI Infusion

- Served as Chief Growth Officer in turnaround situation
- Built MSO for in-office infusion
- Built and managed Novella infusion for AICs across New England
- Diversified client base beyond practices:
	- Signed Grainger Medical (largest IPA in Utah)
	- Became white label partner for Yale School of Medicine gastro practice
	- Expanded to multi-state PE-backed practices

### Echelon Health Partners (EHP) Genesis

- Left OI Infusion in October due to strategic misalignment
- Identified gap: competitors (including McKesson Interfusion with 50% market share) focused only on tactical delivery
- Vision: Move beyond “here’s the formulary and APP” approach
- Strategy: “Tide that comes in to rise all boats” through:
	- Partnerships with payers and drug manufacturers
	- A la carte/modular approach vs binary full service model
	- Continuum of support for any group size

### Technology & Operations Solution

- Best-in-class partner ecosystem:
	- EHR: WeInfuse
	- RCM and care delivery partners
- Revenue model: Solution partners pay referral fees
- Workflow optimization:
	- Built front-end system for internal orders/external referrals
	- Digitized order sets into EHRs
	- Addressing fax-based backend issues (transcription errors, delays)
- Developing smart platform:
	- QA/QC checkpoints
	- Integration with external databases for medical necessity
	- Automated verification against drug requirements

### Provider Activation Strategy

- Key challenge: Provider resistance to new technology
- Success at OI through:
	- Deep dive into practice EMR instances
	- Close collaboration with dev teams (e.g., ECW for e-fax)
- Case study: Rheumatologist processing 320 treatments/month manually
	- Implemented e-order platform on ECW instance
	- Automated internal processes
- Focus on keeping care at medical home
- Value proposition: Translate efficiency into margin

### AIC/OIC Strategy

- AIC challenges:
	- Patient ownership vulnerability
	- Market competition from activated doctors
	- Reliance on external referrals
- Solution: Configure OICs as AICs
	- Hire nurses capable of full formulary administration (60-100 drugs)
	- Create “easy button” for customer success
	- Focus on operational metrics

### GPO & Formulary Strategy

- Not recreating GPOs - pursuing McKesson partnership
- Recommended provider approach:
	- Join specialty group aggregators (BenCare, Rheumatology Network, NeuroNet)
	- Strategic formulary management (70-80% from primary vendor)
	- Supplement with specialty vendors (e.g., Octapharma for IVIG)
- Leverage disease prevalence data for smart formulary choices
- Success case: New start with primary care and FQHC partnership
