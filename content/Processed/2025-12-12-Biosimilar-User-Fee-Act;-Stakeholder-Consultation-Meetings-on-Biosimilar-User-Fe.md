## Summary
FDA is preparing to renew the Biosimilar User Fee Act (BsUFA), which governs how user fees are collected for biosimilar drug approvals. The agency is seeking stakeholder input to help shape the next iteration of the legislation, which expires in September 2027.

## Startup Angle
A startup could emerge that specializes in biosimilar regulatory consulting, helping biotech companies navigate the complex BsUFA reauthorization process and potential new requirements. Companies like Coherus BioSciences or Amgen's biosimilar division could benefit from early insights into potential regulatory changes, while smaller biosimilar startups might need advisory services to stay compliant and competitive.
