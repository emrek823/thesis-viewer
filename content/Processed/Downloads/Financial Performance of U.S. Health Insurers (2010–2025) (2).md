# Financial Performance of U.S. Health Insurers (2010–2025)

## Introduction

U.S. health insurers – both publicly traded firms (e.g. UnitedHealth Group, Humana, CVS/Aetna, Cigna, Elevance Health/Anthem, Centene, Molina) and major nonprofit carriers (e.g. Kaiser Permanente, GuideWell/Florida Blue) – have experienced profound growth and change from 2010 to 2025. This period spans the Affordable Care Act (ACA) rollout, shifts in membership from commercial to government programs, and unprecedented shocks like the COVID-19 pandemic. In this report, we examine industry and company financial performance over 2010–2025 using regulatory filings (NAIC reports, CMS data) and company financials (10-Ks, segment disclosures). Key metrics analyzed include revenue and membership growth, medical loss ratios (MLRs), administrative expense ratios, underwriting and operating margins, and net profit margins. We disaggregate results by major product segments – commercial (employer and individual), Medicare Advantage (MA), Medicaid managed care, and other businesses (such as pharmacy benefit managers, PBMs) – and highlight the impact of policy changes (ACA market reforms, MLR minimums, Medicare Advantage risk adjustment updates) and external events (COVID-19, cyber risks, utilization surges). We also compare company-specific trends to industry-wide benchmarks and provide a forward-looking outlook for 2025–2026 based on forecasts from CMS, PwC, Mercer, and insurer guidance. Summary tables and time-series charts with annotations of major events are included, followed by an appendix of data sources.

## Industry Overview (2010–2025)

Over the past 15 years, the U.S. health insurance industry’s size and aggregate profitability have grown substantially. Annual premium revenues roughly doubled from around $500–600 billion in 2010 to over $1 trillion by 2023, reflecting expansion of coverage under the ACA and growth in Medicare and Medicaid managed care. Total enrollment in private health plans (including employer-group, individual, Medicare Advantage, Medicaid managed care, etc.) increased from about 200 million in 2010 to 270 million by 2023, dramatically reducing the uninsured rate. Public programs drove much of this membership growth: Medicare Advantage enrollment more than doubled between 2010 and 2024, reaching over half of all Medicare beneficiaries, and Medicaid managed care enrollment surged with ACA expansion and the COVID-19 continuous coverage policy (Medicaid/CHIP enrollment peaked around 95 million in 2022). In contrast, the employer-sponsored commercial segment saw modest growth at best, and actually shrank in relative terms as more people obtained coverage through Medicaid or ACA marketplaces during the 2010s.

### Revenue Growth and Consolidation

The industry’s revenue growth has been accompanied by consolidation among insurers. The largest national carriers grew by acquiring competitors and expanding vertically (e.g. UnitedHealth’s Optum, CVS’s acquisition of Aetna in 2018, Cigna’s acquisition of PBM Express Scripts in 2018, Centene’s acquisitions of Health Net and WellCare). UnitedHealth Group’s revenues, for example, climbed from about $94 billion in 2010 to over $360 billion by 2023 (fueled by both insurance and...

# Health Insurance Industry Overview

## Growth of Major Insurers
- GuideWell (Florida Blue’s parent) grew from an $8 billion regional insurer into a $33 billion enterprise by 2024, joining the Fortune 500 at #136.
- Kaiser Permanente, the largest nonprofit integrated insurer, saw operating revenue exceed $100 billion by 2022 (serving ~12 million members) while traditionally operating at low margins (~1–3%).

## Market Concentration
- Overall, market share has concentrated in a handful of firms:
- In the Medicare Advantage market, the top two insurers (UnitedHealth and Humana) together now enroll over 45% of MA beneficiaries.
- Many local markets are dominated by one or two health plans.
- This consolidation has increased insurers’ bargaining power and economies of scale, contributing to financial performance gains in some areas, but has also drawn regulatory scrutiny.

## Profitability Trends
- Industry profit margins have generally improved over the period but with significant swings in certain years due to policy changes and exogenous events.
- In the early 2010s, net profit margins hovered around 1–3%.
- The implementation of the ACA initially squeezed margins:
- 2014 and 2015 saw industry profit margins dip to ~1.1% and 0.6% respectively, as insurers in the new individual exchanges incurred heavy losses and numerous nonprofit co-op plans failed.
- By the late 2010s, however, the industry had adjusted:
- 2017–2019 profit margins stabilized around 2–3%, with 2018 a standout year at 3.2% margin.
- That spike was driven largely by premium increases in the individual ACA market (insurers overshot premiums in 2018–2019 after the uncertainty of ACA repeal attempts and the end of federal cost-sharing reduction payments).

## Profit Margin Trajectory (2014-2023)
| Year | Profit Margin (%) |
|------|-------------------|
| 2014 | 1.1               |
| 2015 | 0.6               |
| 2016 | -                 |
| 2017 | -                 |
| 2018 | 3.2               |
| 2019 | 2-3               |
| 2020 | 3.8               |
| 2021 | -                 |
| 2022 | -                 |
| 2023 | -                 |

### Key Events Impacting Profit Margins
- **COVID-19**: Low claims in 2020 led to historically low medical loss ratios (~82.7%).
- Insurers’ net earnings soared to $31.5 billion in 2020 with a 3.8% margin – the highest in at least a decade.
- However, 2021 saw the opposite effect: insurers were hit with COVID-related costs (testing, deferred care).

## Figure: U.S. Health Insurance Industry Net Profit Margin (2014–2023)
- Profitability dipped sharply in 2014–2015 with ACA implementation, then rebounded by 2018 as insurers adjusted premiums.
- The COVID-19 shock in 2020 drove record margins, followed by a downturn in 2021 when deferred care returned.

# Segment Variations: Different insurance market segments inherently have different MLR and admin cost structures:

| Segment                       | MLR Range         | Average MLR (2023) | Gross Margin per Enrollee (2023) | Notes                                                                                       |
|-------------------------------|-------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Medicaid Managed Care          | ~85–90% minimum   | ~87%                | N/A                               | High MLRs, low margins, premium taxes, and tight state caps on admin and profit allowances. |
| Medicare Advantage             | Minimum 85%       | ~87%                | ~$1,982                           | High revenue per member, stable MLRs, intensive risk coding, projected changes in risk adjustment model. |
| Commercial – Employer Group    | Mid-80s%          | 86%                 | ~$910                             | Lower MLRs due to self-insured business, historical pricing cushion, volatility in margins.  |
| Commercial – Individual/ACA    | 70–75% (2018)     | 84%                 | ~$1,048                           | Most volatility in MLRs, initial underpricing, steep premium hikes, recent profitable experience. |

## Detailed Insights:

- **Medicaid Managed Care**:
- Average MLR in 2023 was ~87%, similar to Medicare Advantage.
- Medicaid MCOs face premium taxes and tighter admin budgets, with margins often targeted at only 1–3%.
- Historically, MLRs have been elevated, sometimes exceeding 90% during expansion years.
- COVID-19 temporarily improved MLRs due to healthier new enrollees, but this reversed in 2023 as higher-risk members increased MLR.

- **Medicare Advantage**:
- MLRs have clustered in the mid-80s, with an average of ~87% in 2023.
- Gross margins per enrollee are the highest of any segment, nearly $1,982 in 2023.
- Operating margins are typically 4–5% net on a high revenue base (~$12,000+ per member/year).
- Upcoming risk adjustment model changes (CMS-HCC v28) are projected to reduce MA risk scores by ~3%, potentially increasing MLRs unless costs are reduced.

- **Commercial – Employer Group**:
- Average fully-insured group market MLR was 86% in 2023.
- Gross margin per enrollee was about $910.
- MLR spiked down to ~80–82% in 2020 due to reduced claims, then rebounded above 85% in 2021–2022.
- Over 2010–2019, group MLRs steadily met the 85% rule, with rebates paid in some years.

- **Commercial – Individual/ACA**:
- The individual marketplace has experienced significant volatility in MLRs.
- Initial underpricing led to MLRs over 100% in 2014–2016, followed by steep premium hikes.
- By 2018, average MLRs dropped to around 70–75%, producing windfall margins.
- In 2023, the individual market MLR averaged 84%, indicating insurers kept 16¢ of every premium dollar for admin/profit.

# Summary of 2023 MLRs and Gross Margins per Enrollee by Major Segment

| Market Segment               | Avg. MLR (2023) | Gross Margin per Enrollee (2023) |
|------------------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Medicaid Managed Care         | ~87%             | $753                              |
| Medicare Advantage            | ~87%             | $1,982                            |
| Employer Group               | ~86%             | $910                              |
| Individual (ACA)             | ~84%             | $1,048                            |

*Gross margin = premium minus claims per member per year, not accounting for admin costs (thus not equal to profit). Source: KFF analysis of NAIC data.

These figures underscore that Medicare Advantage has the richest revenue and gross margins per member, while Medicaid managed care yields the slimmest margins. Administrative expense needs also vary – individual market plans have high selling costs (brokers, marketing, enrollee churn) which eat into their ~$1,048 gross margin; large group plans benefit from scale and often have lower admin cost %; MA plans spend heavily on care management and sales but also get quality bonus payments to offset some costs. Despite similar MLRs across segments in recent years (mid-80s%), profitability differs because premium levels and admin costs differ. As KFF noted, an 85% MLR in Medicaid is not the same as an 85% MLR in Medicare Advantage or commercial, due to different expense structures and per-capita premium levels.

## Underwriting, Operating, and Net Margins

Financial performance can be viewed at different profit levels: underwriting margin (insurance premiums minus claims and operational expenses), operating margin (including other health service revenues and expenses), and net margin (after investment income, taxes, etc.). We focus here on underwriting and net results, since many large insurers now have diversified operations beyond pure underwriting (for example, Optum and CVS Health’s retail/PBM segments).

### Industry Underwriting Results

The health insurance industry’s aggregate underwriting margin is typically just a few percent of premium. NAIC data show a combined ratio (claims + expenses) generally in the 96–99% range over 2010–2023, which corresponds to 1–4% underwriting profit margins. There were notable troughs and peaks: in 2015, the combined ratio hit ~99% (only a 0–1% margin), reflecting ACA losses. In 2018, the combined ratio improved to ~97.0% (3% margin), and in 2020 it dropped to ~96.0% (4% margin) amid suppressed claims. According to NAIC reports, net underwriting gains for the industry were as high as $33 billion in 2020, then swung down to $15.5 billion in 2021. By 2023, the document continues...

# Underwriting Gains and Net Profit Margins

## Underwriting Gains
- Underwriting gains were about **$19.6 billion** (combined ratio ~**98.2%**)
- This is a solid result, though down **23%** from **2022**, due to medical costs outpacing premium growth that year.

## Net Profit Margins
After including investment income, taxes, and other income, the net profit margin for health insurers across the **2010s** typically landed between **2–4%** in good years. Early in the decade, margins were lower (around **1–2%** in **2010–2013**) but trended upward. By comparing **10-year snapshots**:

### 2010–2013
- Industry margins were modest (~**1–2%** on average).
- For example:
- **2010**: Roughly **$5 billion** in net earnings (around **1% margin**)
- **2011**: Somewhat higher (~**$13 billion net**, perhaps ~**3% margin**) due to favorable prior trends.
- The introduction of **MLR rules** in **2011** kept margins in check, as excess gains were rebated.

### 2014–2016
- The **ACA rollout** brought margin compression and volatility.
- Net margin fell to **1.1%** in **2014**, then an all-time low of **0.6%** in **2015**.
- Industry net income was just **$3.7 billion** in **2015** on over **$590 billion** premium.
- Many insurers lost money on new ACA exchange enrollees and struggled with the end of risk-corridor payments.
- **2016** saw slight improvement (**1.1% margin**) but several big insurers (United, Aetna, Anthem) withdrew from most exchanges after continued losses.
- Major policy change: **2014** also introduced the ACA’s MLR floor and rate review, permanently raising the floor on loss ratios and limiting underwriting margins for fully-insured plans.

### 2017–2019
- The individual market stabilized (helped by fewer competitors and steep premium hikes).
- The industry benefited from a relatively healthy economy and stable employer market.
- Net profit margins rose to:
- **2.4%** in **2017**
- **3.2%** in **2018**
- **3.0%** in **2019**
- In dollar terms, net income hit **$23 billion** in **2018** – at the time a record high.
- Notably, **2018’s margin (3.2%)** was the best in decades, aided by insurers overshooting premiums post-ACA and retaining more profit even after rebates.
- The tax law at the end of **2017** also repealed the individual mandate penalty (effective **2019**), but insurers priced conservatively for that, and dire predictions of market collapse did not materialize.
- Regulatory note: The ACA’s health insurer tax was intermittently in effect during this period (suspended in **2017** and **2019**, in effect **2018**), causing some noise in net results as well.

### 2020–2021
- As detailed, **2020** set new records – about **$31.5 billion** in net earnings (**3.8% margin**), thanks to the sharp drop in claims during pandemic lockdowns.
- Much of those gains were either one-time or returned via premium rebates and credits, as insurers recognized the anomaly.
- **2021** fell to **$18.5 billion** net (**2.0% margin**), reflecting the most challenging underwriting year since **2015**.
- The mix shift was dramatic: traditionally, commercial plans produced the majority of industry earnings, but in **2021**, Medicaid and Medicare Advantage combined “generated much higher earnings than the commercial segment,” marking a reversal.
- Public programs essentially propped up industry profits while the employer segment barely broke even.
- This was partly due to membership migration – millions of Americans moved from employer coverage to Medicaid or ACA plans during COVID job losses – and partly due to COVID costs hitting working-age populations harder (commercial plans bore high testing/treatment costs, whereas many seniors delayed care).

# Financial Performance Overview

## Profitability Trends (2022–2023)

- **2022**: Profit margins of **2.4%** (net **$24B**)
- **2023**: Profit margins of **2.2%** (net **$25B**)

These results indicate a return to a “new normal” baseline. By 2023, the industry was consistently profitable and well-capitalized – aggregate capital &#x26; surplus grew to **$215 billion** in 2023, with an average ROE of approximately **11%**. However, margins remained a bit lower than the late 2010s peak, as cost pressures mounted in 2023 (rising hospital costs, new expensive drugs, etc.) and the Medicaid continuous enrollment unwinding removed some low-cost members. Still, the **3%+** margins of 2018–2019 now appear more the exception than the rule, absent another structural change.

## Company-Specific Performance

From a company-specific standpoint, publicly traded insurers generally achieved higher profit growth than the industry average by expanding into new profit streams and leveraging their scale. For instance:

- **UnitedHealth Group**: Consolidated operating margin (including Optum health services) has been approximately **7–8%** in recent years (net margin **5–6%**), well above the industry’s **2–3%** net margin.
- **Cigna** and **CVS**: Report overall operating margins in the mid-single digits.
- **Nonprofit and Regional Blue Cross Blue Shield Plans**: Often operate at break-even or low margins, prioritizing competitive premiums. For example, **Kaiser Permanente’s** health plan and hospital units averaged only **1–2%** operating margin in the 2010s (with some years of losses due to investment swings and high capital spending).

## Underwriting Margins by Segment

According to NAIC and AM Best analysis for 2021:

| Segment                | Contribution to Total Industry Underwriting Earnings |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Commercial             | 10%                                                  |
| Medicaid and Medicare Advantage | 80+%                                        |

Normally, commercial lines offset the thinner margins in government lines, but that flipped in 2020–2021. By 2022–2023, commercial profits improved again as employers’ premium increases caught up with trend and ACA marketplaces grew their risk pools.

- **Medicare Advantage**: Remains highly profitable on an absolute basis (underwriting margin dollars per member are highest there), although MA margins are facing headwinds from tighter payment policies. For example, CMS’s 2023 Star Ratings changes led to fewer bonuses for plans, and risk-adjustment tweaks will trim growth rates.
- **Medicaid Margins**: Structurally small (often &#x3C;2%), but scale can compensate. **Centene**, the largest Medicaid MCO, earned approximately **$1.8B** net in 2022 on **$144B** revenue (approximately **1.3%** net margin), aligned with its thin-margin/high-volume model.

## Impact of Policy and Environmental Changes

Multiple policy shifts and external shocks since 2010 have materially affected insurer financial performance. Here we highlight the most significant:

- **ACA Implementation (2010–2015)**: The Affordable Care Act brought sweeping changes: guaranteed issue and community rating in individual/small-group markets, new fees and taxes, the creation of exchanges and Medicaid expansion (2014), and the aforementioned MLR minimums. The immediate financial impact was turmoil in individual markets – insurers struggled to price for a newly enrolling population. Many experienced large losses from 2014–2016 (as reflected in the industry’s low margins those years) and required capital infusions; over half of ACA co-op insurers went insolvent by 2016. The ACA’s “3R” risk mitigation programs had mixed results: reinsurance helped cover high-cost claims, but the risk corridor program fell short by approximately **$8 billion** when Congress halted full funding, hurting many plans’ 2015 earnings. On the positive side, Medicaid expansion in 2014 opened a lucrative growth avenue – private Medicaid managed care enrollment jumped (14% growth).

in 2021 alone) 48 and brought economies of scale. By 2016, Medicaid and exchange lines were integral to insurers’ earnings despite their lower margins 16. Overall, the ACA expanded insurers’ customer base (by ~20 million lives) but initially at the cost of higher loss ratios until premiums were adjusted upward.

- **ACA MLR Rule &#x26; Premium Regulation:** Starting 2011, health plans had to adhere to MLR floors (80%/85%) and face rate reviews for unreasonable increases. This had a long-term moderating effect on margins – essentially hard-coding that at least 80¢ of each premium dollar goes to care. Insurers responded by tightening administrative spending and accepting smaller per-member margins, especially in fully-insured employer markets. The $11.8B in rebates since 2012 is evidence of the rule’s impact 24. By the late 2010s, insurers had learned to price so that MLR targets were just met (to minimize rebates) – for instance, individual market MLRs fell into the low 80s% by 2017–2018, triggering rebates but also leaving some profit. The MLR rule also spurred diversification: insurers expanded into self-insured administration, fee-based services, and other health adjacencies (where MLR rules don’t apply) to earn income without the 15% cap on admin/profit.

- **Consolidation &#x26; Scale Economies:** The mid-2010s saw attempted mega-mergers (Anthem-Cigna and Aetna-Humana, both blocked in 2017) that would have reshaped the landscape. While those failed, other deals (CVS-Aetna, Centene-WellCare, numerous provider group acquisitions) went through. Larger insurers generally realize lower expense ratios (spreading fixed costs) and greater bargaining power with providers and pharma, aiding margins. However, consolidation can also lead to one-time integration costs. Overall, scale has been a boon: note that “large, diversified carriers fared best” during tough times like 2021, whereas small regional plans were more likely to incur losses 49.

- **Medicare Advantage Policy Changes:** Medicare Advantage has been a growth goldmine, but policy tweaks threaten to modestly erode margins. The most notable recent change is the CMS-HCC risk adjustment model version 28, finalized in 2023, which updates how diagnoses map to payments. CMS estimated it would reduce average MA risk scores by about 3% in 2024, with phase-in through 2026 30. This means lower revenue for plans (especially those that had aggressively coded certain diagnoses). Insurers lobbied against the magnitude of the change, warning it could reduce benefits or push smaller MA players out. In response, CMS is phasing it in over three years to mitigate immediate profit impact. Another change: MA Star Ratings saw a methodological reset post-pandemic – in 2022, CMS ended certain COVID-era leniencies and many plans’ ratings dropped for 2023, cutting bonus payments industry-wide. This hit some MA plans’ 2023–2024 margins (a large national plan, Elevance, cited a ~$500 million revenue reduction due to lower Stars for 2023). Going forward, MA plans are tightening cost control and coding efforts to offset these policy headwinds.

- **COVID-19 Pandemic (2020–2022):** The pandemic’s effect on insurer finances cannot be overstated. In 2020, stay-at-home orders and fear of infection caused utilization (especially elective procedures) to plummet. Health insurers suddenly paid out far less in claims than collected in premium – leading to windfall underwriting gains in Q2–Q3 2020 14. Many insurers proactively gave premium credits or waived cost-sharing to give back some surplus, and MLR rebates in 2021 were huge as noted. In 2021, the pendulum swung: waves of COVID hospitalizations, testing programs, vaccine costs (all mandated to be covered at no cost) and the return of deferred care drove claims above normal levels 18 50. The federal government also required insurers to cover COVID tests even out-of-network (e.g. people going to pricier urgent care for tests) which increased cost per service 50. The public

# Health Insurance Trends and Challenges

## Overview of Recent Trends

- **Medicaid Disenrollment Freeze**: The public health emergency (PHE) froze Medicaid disenrollment, boosting Medicaid MCO membership by millions of lower-risk enrollees (a financial positive for 2020–2021). However, this also meant pent-up demand later.

- **Cost Trends**: By 2022, with widespread vaccination, COVID costs receded somewhat, but insurers faced an unpredictable rebound in routine care and a backlog of more severe cases (e.g., advanced cancers from missed screenings). The NAIC warned in 2021 of potential longer-term cost increases from delayed care worsening health outcomes. Evidence suggests 2022 costs normalized, but 2023 brought surprisingly high utilization in some areas (notably outpatient surgeries by seniors). Overall, COVID’s net effect was that 2020 handed insurers a one-time profit bump, while 2021–2022 mostly evened out those gains, and 2023+ is seeing the after-effects in the form of higher trend rates (e.g., treating conditions that progressed during the pandemic).

## 2023–2024 Utilization Surge and “Shock” Claims

- In mid-2023, health insurers began warning of higher-than-expected utilization, especially among older adults finally getting surgeries that were delayed by the pandemic. UnitedHealth Group noted a surge in orthopedic procedures in early 2023 that drove its Medicare Advantage medical cost trend above assumptions. This realization hit the sector’s financial outlook: UnitedHealth and Humana both had stock drops in 2023 on news of rising medical loss ratios. By 2024, the term “utilization shock” was used as carriers saw inpatient admissions and care intensity rising.

- **Data on Claims**: PwC data show inpatient claims up ~80% from Jan 2023 to Dec 2024, and outpatient up 40% over the same period – indicating a significant care rebound. Insurers had to adjust pricing and reserves accordingly.

## Cybersecurity and Systemic Risks (2024–2025)

- The healthcare industry has become a major cyberattack target. In 2023–2024, several high-profile cyber incidents disrupted health systems and insurers. For example, in early 2025 an “unprecedented attack” hit a critical healthcare financial infrastructure node, highlighting how interdependent payers and providers are.

- **Operational Costs**: While not directly a financial metric like claims, a severe cyberattack can create operational costs (paying ransoms, credit monitoring for members, system downtime affecting cash flow). Insurers have started identifying cyber risk as a key concern; reinsurance surveys rank cyber incidents just behind climate change in potential impact. So far, the cost of cyber events has not materially hit industry financials (beyond one-off expenses), but the risk of a large-scale data breach or IT outage remains a looming threat that could indirectly affect finances (e.g., if providers can’t bill or members can’t access care, there could be unusual cost patterns). Accordingly, 2024–2025 insurer outlooks now factor in enhanced cyber defenses and incident response costs as part of administrative overhead.

## Other Regulatory Shifts

- There are ongoing policy proposals that could impact profitability: drug price controls (the IRA’s Medicare drug negotiation may indirectly affect MA plan drug costs), proposals to cap Medicaid rate growth or impose tighter audits on MA coding, and potential public option discussions (though on hold as of 2025).

- **Election Cycle Impact**: The 2024 election cycle has elevated healthcare as a topic – speculation about Medicare or Medicaid funding cuts has already caused stock volatility. Insurers must navigate this uncertainty; for example, talk of Medicaid block grants or work requirements could reduce enrollment, while conversely a policy like filling the “Medicaid gap” in non-expansion states could add new members.

- **Legislative Changes**: To date, the biggest legislative change since ACA has been the 2021 ARPA subsidy expansion for ACA plans, which boosted individual market enrollment (~3 million more enrollees and lower churn). That expansion is funded.

# Company-Specific Performance Highlights

While industry aggregates tell the overall story, individual insurers have had varied fortunes. Here we compare a few notable players:

| Company                     | Highlights                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **UnitedHealth Group (UNH)**| The largest U.S. insurer saw its revenues and earnings consistently grow through the 2010s, fueled by both insurance (UnitedHealthcare) and services (Optum) segments. UNH’s diversified model gave it resilience – for example, in 2015 while many lost money on ACA exchanges, UnitedHealth’s overall profit was cushioned by employer plans and Optum. That said, UnitedHealth did suffer a rare stumble in 2023–2024: The company underestimated 2024 medical cost trend, particularly in Medicare. By mid-2025, UNH disclosed it would incur **$6.5 billion** more in medical costs than projected for the year. It slashed its 2025 profit forecast nearly in half (leading to the CEO’s sudden departure), and projected Medicare Advantage cost trends of **~7.5%** in 2025, accelerating to **~10%** in 2026 – far above the **~5%** it had assumed. Despite this setback (shares fell **~40%** in 2025), UnitedHealth remains financially strong with ample reserves. It expects a return to profit growth by 2026 after repricing premiums to catch up with trend. This episode highlights that even the most sophisticated insurers can be caught off-guard by rapid changes in utilization. |
| **Humana**                  | Highly focused on Medicare Advantage, Humana enjoyed robust growth as MA enrollment boomed (it is second to United in MA lives). Humana’s margins have generally been solid (**4–5%** net margin range), but it too flagged rising utilization in 2023 and slightly tempered its 2024 outlook. Unlike peers, Humana has largely exited the employer market to double down on government business, a strategy that paid off in high MA growth but concentrates its risk. The company’s 2025 guidance acknowledged the MA rate headwinds (risk adjustment, etc.) but Humana plans to mitigate through value-based provider arrangements and diversifying into primary care clinics. |
| **Elevance Health (Anthem)**| Elevance (rebranded from Anthem in 2022) is a Blue Cross Blue Shield carrier operating in many states. Historically Anthem had a large employer and Medicaid footprint and was less exposed to Medicare. In the 2010s Anthem’s profits rose steadily with its core commercial membership and expansions in Medicaid (it acquired Amerigroup in 2012). A failed bid to buy Cigna in 2017 set it back strategically, but it pivoted to organic growth and launching its own PBM (IngenioRx) in 2020 after ending a partnership with Express Scripts. Elevance’s operating margins in recent years hover **~4–5%**. It has benefited from Medicaid expansion (being a big player in managed Medicaid) and entered MA more aggressively in late 2010s. In 2022–2023, Elevance faced the same trend pressures; it withdrew from some underperforming MA markets for 2024, and like others, saw a drop in Star ratings affecting 2024 revenue. Nonetheless, it consistently grew earnings through the decade, roughly doubling its revenue from **~$60B** in 2010 to **~$156B** in 2022. |
| **Centene and Molina**      | These two specialize in government programs. Centene became the largest Medicaid managed care organization and a big player in ACA exchanges. It grew explosively from **~$5B** revenue in 2010 to **~$140B** in 2022 through acquisitions and expansion. Centene’s margins are razor-thin (often **~1-2%**), but it relies on scale. The continuous Medicaid enrollment during COVID was a boon – Centene added millions of members and saw revenue jump **15%+** in both 2020 and... |

# Current Page Content

## Overview of Insurer Performance

### Centene and Molina Healthcare
- Centene had some losses in the early ACA years and again in 2022 wrote down assets and exited certain exchange markets to improve margins.
- Molina Healthcare, a smaller Medicaid/ACA insurer, had a dramatic turnaround: after losing money in 2015–2016, it restructured, then capitalized on ACA market exits by others to grow membership.
- Molina’s net margins have been ~2–3% recently, higher than most Medicaid-focused peers, thanks to tight cost control and expansion into Medicare products.

### Nonprofit Blue Plans
- **GuideWell (Florida Blue)**: Quadrupled revenue over 14 years, largely by retaining a strong hold on Florida’s individual and employer markets and expanding into Medicare Advantage. Profitability has been “favorable” but modest; AM Best reports its 5-year average return on revenue is in the low single digits.
- **Kaiser Permanente**: Generally plows earnings into its hospitals and infrastructure. Typically reported 1–3% operating margins in the 2010s, with occasional spikes (e.g., 2020 saw a 5.5% Q1 margin due to deferments) and dips (posted a net loss in 2022 due to investment losses and pandemic expenses). Enrollment grew moderately (~9 million in 2010 to 12.7 million in 2023), with MLR around 85%.
- **HCSC (Blue Cross IL/TX/OK/NM/MT)**: Grew membership and maintained generally break-even underwriting, with investment income contributing to net gains.

### Summary of Nonprofit Performance
- Nonprofits tended to prioritize market share and benefits over margin but still built surplus over time (e.g., GuideWell’s capital more than doubled over the decade).

## Profit Growth in Publicly Traded Insurers
- Publicly traded insurers significantly outperformed the overall industry in profit growth, especially through diversified health services (e.g., Optum, CVS Health’s retail and PBM earnings, Cigna’s Evernorth PBM).
- Non-insurance earnings have become a larger share of their income; nearly half of UnitedHealth’s operating profit now comes from Optum’s services, which carry higher margins than insurance.
- This diversification has been a strategic response to margin pressure on the core insurance business.

## Forward-Looking Outlook (2025–2026)
- U.S. health insurers face a more challenging cost environment as enrollment growth opportunities dwindle.
- Medical cost trend is projected to remain elevated at multi-decade highs through 2025 and 2026.
- PwC’s Health Research Institute reports that medical cost trend for 2025–2026 is around 7.5–8.5%, the fastest pace since the mid-2000s.
- Mercer’s 2025 survey finds employers expect a 6.5% increase in health benefit cost for 2026, the highest jump since 2010.
- This projection is after plan design changes; absent any cost-mitigation, employers would have seen nearly 9% cost inflation.
- This marks the fourth consecutive year of above-normal increases, following a decade (2010s) when growth averaged ~3%.

### Key Drivers of Rising Costs
- **General Inflation and Provider Costs**: Economy-wide inflation and a healthcare labor shortage have driven up wages for nurses, technicians, and other staff.
- Hospitals and providers, facing their own margin pressures (hospital operating margins fell from ~7% in 2019 to ~2% in 2024 on average), are negotiating steeper price increases from insurers.
- Provider consolidation into large systems has strengthened their pricing power. These higher unit costs flow directly into premiums.

# Pharmaceutical Innovation (and Expense)
- New therapies – especially high-cost specialty drugs and the new class of GLP-1 weight-loss drugs – are adding significant expense. PwC notes an extra **$50 billion** in pharmacy spending in **2024**, well above prior growth. The popularity of GLP-1 drugs for obesity and diabetes is a major factor, projected to increase drug spend for years. Pharmacy trend is running **~2.5 percentage points** above medical trend. While some cost offsets (biosimilars for biologic drugs) are emerging, the net effect is still upward. Insurers are responding by tightening formularies and pursuing PBM reforms (e.g., more transparent pass-through models) to manage drug costs.

# Rising Utilization Post-Pandemic
- Utilization of healthcare services has rebounded and in some areas exceeds pre-pandemic levels. Behavioral health utilization, for example, jumped **45%** from **Jan 2023 to Dec 2024**, driven by greater acceptance of tele-mental health and higher need. Virtual care has made accessing services easier (removing geographic barriers), which while positive for access, can add volume. Additionally, the population is aging (every day thousands join Medicare), naturally increasing average health utilization. Insurers are observing higher claim intensity – rising inpatient admissions and severity – which boost costs. Some of this is catch-up care from earlier delays, and some may be permanent shifts in how people use the system.

# End of Temporary Subsidies/Enrollment Shifts
- The expiration of ARPA enhanced ACA subsidies after **2025** could lead to some attrition in individual market enrollment or a sicker risk pool if younger, healthier individuals drop coverage. Meanwhile, Medicaid redeterminations in **2024** are disenrolling some members; many are expected to transition to ACA plans or uninsured. The Congressional Budget Office projected that recent policy proposals (like H.R.1 in **2024**) could increase the uninsured population by millions by **2034** if Medicaid funding is curtailed. A shrinking of federally funded coverage could put more cost burden on employers and individuals, potentially pressuring insurers’ top-line growth but also possibly improving risk mix if the sickest remain covered. Insurers are carefully watching policy developments in Washington as they plan for **2025** and beyond.

# Insurer Responses and 2025 Strategies
- In this environment, insurers in late **2024** and **2025** are raising premiums significantly (e.g., ACA marketplace premiums are increasing **~6%** on average for **2024**, and initial indications suggest high single-digit increases for **2025**). Medicare Advantage bids for **2024** came in higher as well, with several MA insurers trimming supplemental benefits to account for payment rates and trend. Employers are increasingly shifting cost to workers through higher deductibles or coinsurance – nearly **60%** of employers plan to make benefit changes in **2026** to control costs. At the same time, payers are doubling down on cost management initiatives: Mercer reports top employer priorities include “managing high-cost claims” and measuring program ROI. Health plans are investing in advanced analytics and AI-driven care management to identify waste and prevent large claims. They are also scrutinizing provider bills more closely (payment integrity programs) and negotiating tougher contracts – although this could lead to more tense insurer-provider relations.

# Regulatory Outlook
- On the regulatory front, insurers’ **2025** outlooks factor in: no major ACA changes (with a divided government, drastic health reform is unlikely before **2025** elections), but implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act’s drug provisions (which may modestly reduce Medicare drug spend in later years), and continued state-level actions on insurance affordability (e.g., Colorado’s public option or capping hospital prices in some states). Cybersecurity has emerged as a focus area for resilience – as noted, **2024** saw record healthcare cyber attacks. Insurers in **2025** are expected to increase IT security spending and scenario-plan for potential disruptions (some even exploring cyber insurance coverage for themselves).

# Financial Forecasts
- The consensus among industry analysts is that **2024–2025** will be challenging margin years (due to high claims trend and Medicare Advantage payment adjustments), but margins could...

improve in 2026 if current pricing catches up. UnitedHealth, for example, signaled it expects a return to its
normal earnings growth trajectory by 2026 after the 2025 reset 62  59        . CMS’s National Health Expenditure
projections (released by the Office of the Actuary) anticipate private health insurance spending growth of
~6–7% annually over 2025–2027, which implies insurers’ premium revenues will rise accordingly. However,
medical cost growth will be in the same ballpark, so no major change in aggregate margins is expected –
the industry might maintain a ~2% net margin overall. Capital positions are strong entering 2025 (industry
capital &#x26; surplus at record levels 85 ), so insurers have buffers to absorb near-term shocks.

One wildcard is the economy: a recession could hit employer enrollment (fewer people with job-based
insurance) but boost Medicaid enrollment (if unemployment rises). In such a scenario, insurers with
diversified portfolios (including Medicaid and ACA lines) might actually fare better than those reliant on
commercial risk. Historically, health insurance is less cyclical than other industries, but product mix shifts
can impact profits.

Another area to watch is innovation and value-based care. As cost pressures rise, insurers are
accelerating moves into value-based payment models that hold providers accountable for costs. If effective,
these could bend trend down later in the decade. Additionally, the rise of large employers contracting
directly with providers or Medicare contracting with Medicare Advantage directly (ACO Reach, etc.) could
change the role of insurers somewhat. But for 2025–2026, such changes will be gradual.

In summary, insurers are entering 2025 on a cautious note: trend at 15-year highs     86         , margins a bit
compressed, but still fundamentally strong in financial terms. Growth opportunities exist (Medicare
Advantage still increasing, Medicaid managed care expansions in holdout states, and ancillary services), yet
so do risks (policy shifts, high inflation, and system shocks). The expectation is that premium increases will
eventually catch up to cost trends by 2026, stabilizing margins, albeit likely at levels slightly below the peak
profits of the late 2010s. As one PwC analysis put it, health plans must “meet affordability head-on” by
reducing waste and improving care management to navigate this new equilibrium of higher costs
87              . Those that do so successfully – leveraging their data, technology, and capital – should remain
financially sound through 2025 and beyond.

# Summary Tables and Figures

Provided above in the report, this chart illustrates the timeline of health insurer profit margins with annotations of major events (ACA, COVID-19, etc.)   8  14 . It shows the dramatic dip in 2015 (0.6% margin) and peak in 2020 (3.8%), with a general trend of improvement from the early 2010s to late 2010s, and stabilization around 2–3% in recent years.

The table highlights 2015 (ACA losses), 2020 (COVID gains), and 2023 (recent year) for contrast.

From Table 1, we clearly see the nearly 2x growth in premiums and enrollment from 2015 to 2023, as well as the swing in margins. Notably, the loss ratio in 2020 was ~3–4 points lower than surrounding years (a significant deviation), and enrollment jumped markedly from 213 million in 2015 to 270 million in 2023 (due to expansion of government programs and overall population covered).

## Table 2. Segment Performance Snapshot (2023):

| Individual    | ~16 M            | ~$600            | ~29%       | ~84%              | ~$87                | ~2–4%               |
| Medicare      | ~30 M            | ~$1,000          | ~29%       | ~87%              | ~$165               | ~4–5%               |
| Medicaid      | ~75 M            | ~$500            | ~29%       | ~87%              | ~$63                | ~1–3%               |
| PBM          | n/a (270M serviced) | (Revenue ~$100 PMPM) | n/a (not an MLR) | Margin per script small | ~1% (on revenue) | |

**Sources:** Enrollment from KFF, CMS; premium and margin per member from KFF/NAIC data. PBM margins are low (~ $5–$10 per script). This illustrates that Medicare Advantage yields the highest revenue and gross margin per member (but also higher cost), whereas Medicaid yields the lowest. Net margins are a function of both the gross margin and the administrative cost structure; e.g., Medicaid’s net is lowest.

## Figure 2. Gross Margin Per Enrollee by Market (2023):

This bar chart (based on KFF analysis) would show Medicare Advantage far on top (~$1,982), individual ~$1,048, group ~$910, Medicaid ~$753.

It underscores how Medicare Advantage has been a key profit driver, explaining why insurers have invested heavily in that segment.

### Figure 3. Medical Cost Trend Projections
A line or bar chart could illustrate the rising projected cost trend:
- 2022: ~6%
- 2023: ~7%
- 2024: ~7.5%
- 2025: ~8.5% (group)
- 2026: 8.5% group / 7.5% individual

Annotations might note “Highest medical inflation since 2007” and drivers like GLP-1 drugs and hospital labor costs.

In the interest of brevity, additional figures are not exhaustively described, but the overall visual story is: steady growth in premiums and enrollment; volatile but upward-trending profit margins with clear dips/spikes at policy and pandemic inflection points; and a recent uptick in cost trend that is squeezing margins heading into 2025.

## Conclusion

From 2010 to 2025, U.S. health insurers moved from an era of ACA growing pains into a period of expansion and profitability, only to be stress-tested by a global pandemic and emerging cost pressures. Industry revenues and membership reached all-time highs, fueled by public programs and consolidation. Insurers achieved moderate profit margins in the low single digits, more consistent and slightly higher than a decade prior, but still modest relative to other industries due to regulatory constraints and the inherent volatility of healthcare costs. Key financial metrics – MLRs, expense ratios, margins – generally improved through scale and efficiency gains, yet they were periodically reset by shocks (ACA, COVID). Segment analysis revealed a shift in profit pools: government-sponsored businesses (Medicare Advantage, Medicaid) have become as important as commercial in underwriting earnings, even though they run at high MLRs, thanks to sheer volume and revenue per member.

Major policy changes like the ACA transformed the market landscape (expanding coverage to tens of millions but compressing margins via MLR rules), and ongoing tweaks in Medicare and Medicaid will continue to shape where and how insurers make money. The COVID era, meanwhile, demonstrated insurers’ financial resilience – and also their exposure to sudden swings in utilization. By 2025, insurers face a new challenge: multi-year high medical inflation, forcing a renewed focus on cost containment and pricing discipline to protect margins.

Looking forward, the consensus is cautious optimism. While near-term margins are under pressure, insurers are adapting through diversification (into care delivery, wellness, data analytics) and pushing value-based care to tame cost trends. Barring seismic policy changes, the large established insurers are expected to maintain profitability in the coming years – albeit at levels that require constant management of the medical loss ratio and administrative efficiency. In essence, the period from 2010 to 2025 has been one of tremendous growth and strategic evolution for health insurers. Those that navigated the ACA’s overhaul and capitalized on emerging opportunities (Medicare Advantage growth, Medicaid expansion, PBM integration) have prospered. As we enter 2025–2026, health insurers must leverage all lessons learned – from risk pooling to rapid product repricing – to weather the current cost storm and continue fulfilling their dual mandate: financing Americans’ healthcare needs while delivering sustainable financial performance.
