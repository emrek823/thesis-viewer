POINT ZERO PAYMENT INTEGRITY

Moving Further Left Than Ever Before.

Transforming payment integrity by engaging providers before claims are even created—turning adversarial relationships into collaborative partnerships while dramatically reducing costs.

THE HEALTHCARE PAYMENT CRISIS

Approaching a Critical Breaking Point

$400 billion lost annually to sophisticated fraud schemes

Providers drowning under administrative burdens from denials, appeals, & resubmissions

Payers struggling with exploding claims volumes and inaccurate submissions

System where abrasion is high - payers and providers lack transparency & collaboration

POINT ZERO PAYMENT INTEGRITY SOLUTION

A New Approach: Point Zero pioneers pre-claim provider education—the earliest payment integrity intervention on the market, engaging providers before claims are even created.

+ Point Zero Payment Integrity pioneers a new intervention point in the healthcare payment lifecycle by moving further left than ever before— engaging providers before claims are even created.

+ This approach enables first-time accuracy through pre-claim education rather than post-claim correction, reducing costly denials, appeals, and resubmissions while creating a more efficient process for all stakeholders.

+ By transforming traditionally adversarial payer-provider relationships into partnerships, Point Zero allows providers to focus on patient care instead of administrative burdens while significantly reducing provider abrasion.

The Point Zero Advantage

+ Generates significantly higher ROI than traditional later-stage interventions by addressing issues before they become costly problems.

+ Makes reviewing low-dollar claims economically viable and enables savings in sensitive areas like mental health, where payers often avoid interventions to prevent member abrasion.
