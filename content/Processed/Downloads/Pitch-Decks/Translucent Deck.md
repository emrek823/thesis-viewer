Healthcare Finance Work is broken from ground up

**SYSTEMATIC INFRASTRUCTURE PROBLEMS**
Revenue Is Lagged, Negotiated, and Nonlinear | Provider Comp. Models are Extremely Complex | Critical Finance and Ops Data Silos

**DOWNSTREAM IMPACT ON TEAMS**
Talent is Rare and Expensive | Even the Best Teams Overwhelmed with Work | Operators Frustrated with Finance, Lack Answers

**BUSINESS IMPACT**
Provider Organization's are flying blind, unable to effectively run the business daily / weekly / monthly / quarterly

Value / ROI / Usage at a Glance

**STRONG EARLY USAGE**
70%+ of engaged users run 5-20 queries per session

**PRODUCTIVITY GAINS**
For example in one week, we handled 64 FP&A requests / workflows equating to 200 hrs in time savings

**ERROR REDUCTION**
• Lack of real-time data updates - Found 20% data discrepancy with scheduling data in Excel models
• Version control issues - Found APP mapping information not updated for months, driving incorrect benchmarking

**EXPANSION PULL**
Users are engaging with our product to understand productivity, benchmarking, rev performance. But they want more and are aggressively pulling us to add data / use cases
