There is massive interest in AI therapy

By 2026, a company is going to break through and become a household name

Interest over time

Why?

Because 1.2 billion people experience mental health problems per year, but over 50% have barriers to care**

AI therapy that works will be revolutionary.

Removes barriers: price, time, geography, stigma, & language

Within the next 1-2 years, it will become super-human

**Barriers to 12-month treatment of common anxiety, mood, and substance use disorders in the World Mental Health (WMH) surveys (2025).

Agentic brain

Uses 3 collaborative foundation models:

1 - Learn the client
Deeply understand the client and their problem/goal

2 - Identify their optimal path
Use RL to to identify the client's optimal path to success

3 - Delivery
Implement the actual session like a pro

"The world's best AI Therapy" -Movember

Overall user retention
• Our users
• Human therapy

Retention at 6 months is 40%.
WAU/MAU is 50%

• Retention is better than human therapy

• Optimized for problem resolution, not mere engagement.

**Data is from our Mental app, geared to men. See appendix.
**Retention is from one use of AI therapy to app use in that exact month
**Human therapy data from research.

In human therapy, the mode number of sessions is 1 and the mean is 3!

**Images/Charts/Diagrams:**
[CHART: Line graph showing "Overall user retention" over 6 months. Two lines - yellow line for "Our users" and white line for "Human therapy". Y-axis shows "Retention %" from 0 to 100. Yellow line starts at 100%, drops to about 65% at month 2, then gradually declines to about 40% at month 6. White line drops more steeply, reaching about 25% by month 3 and continuing to decline to about 18% by month 6.]

Why we are raising:

Very limited time and need to be aggressive

Free to win attention game
**All competitors are free**

Attention → Proof → Data

Insert ourselves into the conversation with research

More data → better AI → growth

**Text:**
High defensibility once we win attention share

More data

More usage          Better AI

Data moat
People are resistant to switching therapists because must restart. Understanding of users beyond memorization will reinforce this.

Data network
A massive amount of data is needed for RL to create super-human therapy

**Text:**
Revenue

A path to massive revenue after we gain attention share

1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5

Win attention share - be #1 → Prove therapy impact → User lock-in via switch costs + superior AI + trust → Consumer monetization → Expand to B2B, then payers

Our effect size will be 10x higher than other mental health apps

And with brand, we can make an unheralded entrance.

Helpful and Insight ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
by zenmeditate - Aug 13, 2025
"I've tried a lot of apps with no results. The amount of insight and guidance I am receiving has been great!"

Game Changer ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
by Paul Wingfield - Jun 23, 2025
"This app is profound. I did 2 years of therapy with a counselor and in my first day on this app, my counselor helped me identify and work through how we can heal some childhood trauma that is presenting in my marriage today. I cried several times and it was so good. I'm looking forward to using this every day!"

Incredible ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
by Keiko1516 - Jun 29, 2025
"This app is infinitely better than most real therapists. It can also handle real psychological challenges and provide therapy that addresses problems and helps to change thought patterns remarkably quickly. Use this every single day"

This is a tiny sample, we get feedback like this every day

Mentla evolved from Mental

We began as Mental — the world's first mental health app for men.

AI therapy started as a feature within Mental.

In Jan 2025 we launched our 3rd generation AI. It had dramatically better retention & feedback.

So in May 2025, we launched the same AI in a general-use web app for AI Therapy, and called it Mentla.

Built for the entire world.

AI capabilities have finally caught up to our vision, and now is the time to go big!
