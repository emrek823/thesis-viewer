Pharma has the human evidence needed for success sitting in biobanks but can't turn it into actionable answers fast enough. That's the market opportunity.

Today's AI Fails When Applied To Real Human Outcomes

Most AI in drug discovery is trained on cell lines, animal models, protein structures rarely validated on real human outcomes.

We tested 11 leading mutation-effect prediction models on real human population data. Only 2 beat random chance. The rest learned patterns that don't translate to actual patients.

**Images/Charts/Diagrams:**
[CHART: Bar chart showing ΔBIC values for different models. MutationTaster shows 27.4, Alpha-Missense (Mixed-MSA) shows 13.1, DEOGEN2 shows 11.8, FATHMM shows 2.2, ESM-1b shows 1.6, SIFT shows 0.7, PolyPhen-2 HDIV shows 0.5, PrimateAI shows -1.0, BayesDel shows -3.1, MutPred shows -8.3, BayesDel-AddAF shows -10.6. A dashed line at 0 indicates random chance level.]

Millions of Genomes Sitting Idle

The Opportunity
Massive biobanks now exist. Genomes linked to electronic health records and real clinical outcomes:

• UK Biobank
• All of Us (NIH)
• Our Future Health
• Proprietary pharma datasets

The Bottleneck
• Traditional tools break beyond ~40K samples
• Analyses take months & iteration is impossible
• Biobanks should be the ultimate translational engine

Instead, they're frozen assets.

**Images/Charts/Diagrams:**

The Missing Piece, SLMM: Clean Signal Extraction

Clean human signal extraction at scale is the missing piece for validation today, AI training tomorrow, and clinical simulation after that.

SLMM — The Data Refinery for Human Genomics

Biobank data is like crude oil — valuable, but unusable in raw form.

SLMM, our patent pending product, is the refinery. 7 years of work on SLMM that extract clean, causal human signals at biobank scale.

The Fuel We Produce:

1. Validation — Test any target against real human outcomes
2. Training Data — Clean signals become reward functions for AI
3. Foundation Models — The only AI trained on refined human data

IP Protection: Two provisional patents being filed.

**Images/Charts/Diagrams:**
[CHART: Line graph showing Runtime (hours) vs Sample size (in thousands). Two lines plotted - "Old way" (purple dashed line) showing exponential growth reaching about 10 hours at 100K samples, and "G2P Bio" (teal solid line) showing linear growth reaching about 3 hours at 300K samples. Text notes: "Old tools break after ~40K samples. SLMM keeps refining at 300K+. That's a 1000× speed advantage."]

The Only Foundation Model Trained on Real Human Outcomes

1
Step 1
SLMM extracts clean genetic signals from biobanks

2
Step 2
Signals become reward functions for AI training

3
Step 3
Reinforcement learning trains models on genotype to phenotype & outcomes

Other AI Models
• Trained on mice, cells, protein structures
• Hope it translates to humans
• 9/11 failed our human benchmark

G2P Foundation Model
• Trained on millions of real patients
• Grounded in human outcomes
• Improves via RL on clean signals

Why no one else can do this: Their data is contaminated. Their AI learns noise. We have the only clean training signal at scale.

20× Improvement Over State-of-the-Art

556 vs 27

Order of magnitude improvement over state-of-the-art mutation effect predictor, a glimpse of what's now possible with G2P.

ΔBIC benchmark across 13 mutation-effect prediction models tested on human population data. Higher is better. Zero = random chance.

Two Ways to Win in Drug Development

Translational Insights (Today)
• Show which targets have genuine human genetic support
• Kill weak AI models early
• Tune capable models to better explain outcomes

Clinical Execution (Tomorrow)
• Design trials that succeed
• Identify subpopulations most likely to respond
• Trial simulation to optimize design before spending $100M

Even good targets fail because trials are mis-designed — wrong cohort, wrong endpoint, wrong power assumptions. We solve these problems.

What We Sell Today — Human Validation Services

Deliverables
• Does this target show effect in humans?
• What effect sizes and safety signals exist?
• Which model performs better for the outcome of interest?
• Are our efforts in AI translating into improvements in predicting human outcomes?
• Next: Train population based foundation models for the outcomes of interest

Turnaround
Weeks, not months. Faster iteration = better decisions.

Proof of value: Altos Labs paid $100K and changed R&D priorities based on our analysis. We needed 3× fewer samples than existing tools to reach the same statistical power.
