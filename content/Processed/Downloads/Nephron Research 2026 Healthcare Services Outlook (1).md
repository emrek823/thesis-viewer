**Drug Distributors**
• Buy rated on all three drug distributors given potential for continuation of specialty trends to drive upward earnings revisions vs current guidance
• Distis will trade together in 2026; forced to rank we put MCK and COR ahead on specialty exposure though CAH will continue to benefit from current guidance
• Near term regulatory risk (2026) is manageable, but mid-term risk is more troubling (2028 MFN), concerns over 2027 & 2028 could weigh on disti 2026 multiples

**Favorite Themes**
• Distributors have more room to run – we examine comparable distributors with 20%+ EPS growth and see strong case for parity with S&P500
• What will end the distributor golden age? We detail near to mid term regulatory risk and response
• PBMs in Peril – extended focus on market volatility, regulatory risk, operational challenge impacting the PBM segments of CI, CVS and UNH

**2026 Positioning**
• While we have seen some signs of operating stability in the past quarter, mostly centered in Medicare Advantage, we continue to see significant signs of earnings pressure in other segments, and the regulatory outlook may have actually worsened. Because we are seeing different concerns within each segment, investors remain on the sidelines with stocks in 4Q25 still underperforming the market

• The good news is we think we are past the trough in MA, and believe that could be enough to drive some selective upside in 2026

• Valuations don't appear as compelling on the surface, but if the group is entering a margin recovery period, the valuations compared to embedded earnings are as attractive as we have seen in many years

• We are recommending companies with lower valuations based on embedded earnings

• OVERALL: We recommend an equalweight position for managed care, especially in the near term (again)

**Higher Multiples Predicated on:**
• Overall Margin Expansion/Embedded Earnings Opportunity
• MA Turnaround Opportunity
• Diversification (especially non-regulated earnings)
• Faster growth
• Value Based Care Opportunity
• Higher Returns
• Track Record
• Management

• Introducing 2027 EPS estimates which call for average growth of 21% (ex OSCR), almost 2x 2026 growth as the industry begins its margin recoupment phase

• Updated targets point to 21% upside in sector with buys averaging 36%

• Updated targets imply 17.0x 2026 EPS and 13.5x 2027, which we view as very reasonable relative to historical norms

• Highest potential seen at MOH (up 50%) and CNC (up 42%)

• We upgrade MOH to Buy

Managed Care Thesis: Uncertainty As the Only Certainty
We enter 2026, our broken record continues to not spin. Our thesis remains that the market hates uncertainty, and managed care investors are facing significant amounts of uncertainty across all segments. While we see opportunities for clarity starting in 2026 in certain segments

**1. Medicare Advantage:** What we view as the ray of sunshine, as we believe we are past trough and expect the margin improvement cycle to begin in 2026, albeit at a modest pace to start. We see signs of cost stability, expect benefit redesign impacts, and a solid prelim rate notice at the end of January. Longer term, the segment has likely inflected to a lower margin level, but achieving that level is certainly not reflected in stocks

**2. Medicaid.** The mismatch between rates and acuity post redeterminations has been worse and longer to rectify than expected. Most companies expect margin compression again in 2026, and the looming impacts of the OBBB begin in 2027. The market is most pessimistic here which likely creates an opportunity as we do not believe that OBBB impacts will be as draconian as the market anticipates

**3. Exchanges:** Uncertainty may be an understatement with respect to HIX. The immediate fears center on a utilization rush prior to coverage losses, significant membership attrition, the shift in market morbidity, and pricing to recover margins after a terrible 2025. This is all against the backdrop of enhanced subsidy expiration in two weeks (we think)

**4. Commercial:** While cost trends have run modestly ahead of expectations, we continue to see pockets of Specialty Pharmaceuticals and Behavioral Health pressure the segment. We see looming impacts from a further acceleration in overall trends as employers look for solutions to combat that trend

**5. Valuations:** After very weak performance for the past three years, absolute P/Es are at just a 3% discount to historical norms while relative P/E ratios are well below historical averages. This ignores embedded earnings

The Embedded Earnings Story
The embedded earnings thesis is more powerful today

**Images/Charts/Diagrams:**
[TABLE: Embedded earnings analysis showing MA, Medicaid, and HIX segments with percentages and EPS impacts]

**MA Section:**
| Company | MA % of Total | Est MA Margin | MA EPS+ at 4.5% | 2025 EPS | Embedded MA Boost |
|---------|---------------|---------------|------------------|----------|-------------------|
| HUM | 77% | 0.80% | $24.87 | $17.10 | 145% |
| CNC | 10% | -1.50% | $1.97 | $2.00 | 98% |
| UNH | 47% | 2.00% | $4.73 | $16.25 | 29% |
| MOH | 14% | 0.00% | $4.19 | $14.00 | 30% |
| CVS | 41% | -1.50% | $2.07 | $6.63 | 31% |
| ELV | 15% | 0.75% | $4.06 | $30.00 | 14% |
| CI | 0% | - | $0.00 | $29.60 | 0% |
| Average | 29% | - | - | - | 50% |

**Medicaid Section:**
[Similar table structure for Medicaid with embedded boost calculations]

**HIX Section:**
[Similar table structure for HIX with embedded boost calculations]

• Achieving 4.5% MA margins could boost sector wide EPS by 50%
  • We believe MA margins have troughed and see the most potential short term upside in the MA segment
  • The largest potential upside is seen at Humana, with 145% upside
  • Centene is next with 98% upside

• Achieving 4.0% Medicaid margins would boost sector wide EPS by 56%
  • We are skeptical around any material improvements in margins in 2026, and believe that target margins are achievable by 2028 at best
  • Remember, Medicaid will face additional mix shifts through the OBBB starting in 2027, potentially creating additional margin headwinds
  • Centene has the largest potential upside with 290% upside to of EPS

• Achieving 6.5% HIX margins would boost sector wide EPS by 45%
  • There are few areas with more current uncertainty than the exchanges. That said, repricing HIX is fully in the hands of the plans.
  • Beyond OSCR, Centene has the largest potential with 254% upside
  • MOH has the next most potential with 46% upside

The Embedded Earnings Story
The group is certainly cheap if historical highs are attained, even cheaper if embedded EPS is achieved

| CI | $29.60 | $0.50 | 2% | $30.10 | 9.0x | 8.8x | $29.60 | 2025 | 9.0x |
| UNH | $16.25 | $6.46 | 40% | $22.71 | 20.2x | 14.5x | $27.67 | 2024 | 11.9x |
| Average | - | - | 151% | - | 13.8x | 7.4x | - | - | 8.8x |

• If target margins are achieved across MA, Medicaid and HIX, we estimate average upside to 2025 EPS of 151%
  • The largest potential upside is seen at CNC, with HUM and MOH distant 2nd/3rd
  • This analysis ignores all other potential areas of upside ranging from VBC assets to Stop Loss

• Stocks are trading at 13.8x our 2025 EPS estimates, but 7.4x the embedded EPS estimates
  • We estimate CNC is cheapest relative to its potential target margins
  • MOH now has the second most potential upside
  • HUM screens as just third
  • Again, this ignores potential upside in other segments which is more important for UNH and CVS

• Lastly, the group trades at 8.8x peak EPS (i.e. EPS that has already been achieved in the past)

**Text:**
Physician Enablement: Items to Watch For
2026 will focus on underlying Medicare Advantage, Growth vs Contraction and capital

• Physician enablement remains a derivative of Medicare Advantage for many, and trends roll downhill
  ○ Positives:
    • Improved Reimbursement
    • Stabilizing trend
    • Benefit rationalization
  ○ Negatives:
    • Final year of V28
    • STAR challenges

• For the first time ever, major re-contracting efforts are underway to better align incentives

• Capital and Balance Sheets remain in focus: Inability to raise capital, and stubbornly high interest rates

• Diversification: Inroads into both the commercial and Medicaid segments are ramping

• Cohort Maturation: With slower growth comes more impact from older cohorts

• Sentiment: Based on our survey, sentiment remains very low with investors still looking for more downside

Sentiment is Negative
And worse than last year (and the year before)

• Only 3% of investors were overweight the sector, down from 11% last year, 14% in 2023 and 37% back in 2022

• Translation: No one owns these stocks

• Some 62% are underweight/short the segment, which is also a four-year low

• The main issues are likely focused in MA, risk adjustment, performance/execution (duh), and balance sheets

S1: Embedded Earnings Opportunity in MA/Medicaid/HIX
Challenging results in MA, Medicaid, and HIX for 2025 have created an embedded earnings opportunity as underlying operations improve

**Images/Charts/Diagrams:**
[TABLE: MLRs by Business Line (NAIC) showing quarterly data from 1H17 to 1H25 with YoY and 3-Yr trends]

[TABLE: Estimated MA EPS Exposure by Company showing Medicare Advantage EPS data from 2010-2026E for various companies]

• Performance in MA, Medicaid, and HIX has clearly been challenged in 2025
  ○ MA continued to be negatively impacted by reimbursement cuts, V28, and mispricing across certain plans
  ○ Medicaid has also become a pervasive issue, driven primarily by elevated utilization (behavioral, pharmacy, home health, LTC, etc.), as well as dislocations between member acuity/rates
  ○ After several years of strong performance, HIX degraded significantly in 2025 as market morbidity worsened and utilization was pressured

• According to data from NAIC, the MA industry saw a further 120bps y/y increase in MLR during 1H25

• HIX has seen an even sharper increase through 1H25, with the segment MLR up 1,019bps y/y. Medicaid remains pressured at a 91.4% MLR in 1H25, up 876bps over the past 3 years

## Page 19

**Text:**
S1: Embedded Earnings Opportunity in MA/Medicaid/HIX
MA and HIX should see improvements in 2026, though Medicaid remains challenged

• We believe that MA is finally on the road to recovery in 2026, aided by pricing/benefit reductions (including an expected reduction in benefits), a more rational competitive environment, and stronger reimbursement

• Plans have priced for significant margin improvement in the ACA exchanges, even in the absence of an extension of enhanced subsidies

• That said, Medicaid remains challenged for 2026, with UnitedHealth, Elevance, and Molina all speaking to further contraction next year (while Centene appears the most optimistic in projecting a flat MLR y/y)

• For perspective on the potential impact of margin improvement, we estimate that every ~100bps of MLR improvement across MA is worth 11.8% of EPS across our coverage (or ~13.8% excluding Cigna), 17.5% for Medicaid, and 5.9% for the ACA exchanges

**Images/Charts/Diagrams:**
[TABLE: EPS Impact from ~100bps MLR Improvement Across MA/Medicaid/HIX showing percentages and impacts for different companies]

S2: Medicare Advantage Opportunity
We believe the MA industry is currently operating at trough margins

• Given the combination of reimbursement cuts, risk model changes, utilization pressures, and mispricing, we estimate that the MA industry is now operating at a negative pre-tax margin for the first time in at least 25 years

• Industry-wide MLRs for the industry have trended between 83%-87% for the better part of 15 years
  ○ In 2023, we saw the industry MLR surpass 87.5% for the first time in decades due to pressures seen toward the end of the year. This increased a further ~220bps y/y to 89.8% in 2024 (one of the worse increases on record)
  ○ In 2025, we project that the industry-wide MA MLR will be 91.0% (i.e. the highest seen in decades)

There were a variety of pressures on MA margins in 2025, including mispricing, v28, and utilization

**Images/Charts/Diagrams:**
[TABLE: Sources of MLR Pressure (vs Expectations) by Quarter showing detailed breakdown by company (UnitedHealth, Humana, CVS, Elevance, Centene, Cigna, Molina) across quarters 3Q24, 4Q24, 1Q25, 2Q25, 3Q25 with specific issues listed for each period]

• Based on payor commentary, it appears that the incremental pressures in 2025 stemmed from a series of factors, including: 1) mispricing as evidenced by a minimal reduction in rebate PMPM levels; 2) higher cost trends associated with specialty Rx, the two-midnight rule, outpatient utilization, and supplemental benefits that emerged in 2H24 post the filings of 2025 bids; and 3) higher than expected pressure in 2025 related to v28, group MA, and higher complexity members/duals

S2: Medicare Advantage Opportunity
With the industry at trough margins, the opportunity for future upside is more meaningful

• Widespread industry challenges have led to a disaster with respect to MA margins

• Shown below, MA margins fell to 1.0% in 2023 (lowest since 2015), and have fallen further to -0.7% in 2024 and an estimated -2.0% in 2025

• Clearly, these are not a sustainable level of margins for the industry, especially when factoring in the underlying cost of capital and the assumption of underwriting risk:
  ○ CFO Susan Diamond (5/14/24): "5% to 3.5% (MA margins) is more reasonable in terms of what you can expect and minimally necessary just given the sort of the capital required in the business, the risk that we're taking. Minimally, we think that the industry will demand that as a minimum margin."

• The age-in rate is expected to remained elevated through at least 2030, with the daily rate projected to be above 11.0K in each year between 2024-2030

• Medicare spending expected to increase to 26% of NHE (or $2.19 trillion) by 2033 (up from 21% in 2023)

Future Catalyst #2: Rate updates are stronger for 2026, and could remain strong in 2027

• The MA payment rate update for 2026 is one if he strongest in many years. Exclusive of estimated coding trend (which is not set by CMS), CMS finalized an MA rate increase of 5.06% for PY 2026

• Much of the strength was driven by a very strong effective growth rate of 9.04% (inclusive of error corrections for prior periods of underpayment), which is the highest level finalized in the past 20+ years

• Given the beneficial rate update in 2026, plan/geographic exits, and more material benefit rationalization, we expect that margin improvement in 2026 will be modest but positive

[TABLE: Estimated PMPM Costs for the FFS Program by Year (Final 2026 Rate Notice) showing FFS USPCC Cost Estimates and YoY Growth by Year from 2010-2028]

• Looking beyond 2026, there are signs that the effective growth rate for 2027 (i.e. the starting point for 2027 MA rates) will remain strong
  ○ CMS' latest estimates point to total FFS PMPM costs (Parts A and B) of $1,303 in 2027. This equates to an increase of 5.90% y/y relative to the agency's most updated 2026 PMPM estimates, representing an acceleration of 161bps relative to the underlying trend projected in 2026
  ○ In other words, outside of the two pandemic-impacted years, CMS is starting with a 2027 projected growth rate that is the highest in over 20 years

• Beyond the strong starting point for the effective growth rate in 2027, there will also be a benefit from the removal of the v28 risk model headwind of -3.01% recorded in 2026

Future Catalyst #2: Rate updates are stronger for 2026, and could remain strong in 2027 (continued...)

• CMS continuously revises its estimates for cost growth during the rulemaking cycle, though the final landing spot tends not to change much

• As noted previously, the final 2026 rule estimates that PMPM costs for the FFS program will increase 5.90% y/y in 2027
  ○ Historically, the agency has revised these estimates downward by about -17bps from the prior year final rule (e.g. final 2026 rule) to the preliminary rate update (i.e. the 2027 prelim rule)
  ○ From that point, the agency typically upwardly revises the cost growth estimate by 12bps in the final rule (e.g. final 2027 rule), with the final cost growth estimate coming in just -5bps below the estimates contained in the prior year final rule
  ○ If these trends were to hold, the final cost growth assumption used for the effective growth rate in final 2027 MA rates would be 5.85%, still one of the strongest in the past decade. If instead CMS corrected the projected growth rate by -97bps (the largest downward adjustment in the past 10+ years), underlying cost growth would still be 4.93% for 2027 (i.e. the third strongest of the past decade)

Future Catalyst #3: The Trump Administration is seen as a positive for the industry

• Prior to the impact of estimated coding trend (not controlled by CMS), annual rate updates from the first Trump Administration averaged 2.42% from PY2018-PY2022, much stronger than the 1.24% seen under the Biden Administration
  ○ As President Trump was transitioning out of office, the administration accelerated rate development for PY2022 and implemented a 4.08% increase for PY2022 in what we viewed as a final parting gift for the industry

• Trump explicitly criticized the Biden administration's stance towards MA, stating: "Joe Biden has cut your Medicare Advantage for the last two years. Did you know that? He's cut your Medicare Advantage, which is a total betrayal of seniors. And just check, you'll see it. He has cut you down for two years straight."

[TABLE: Projected Net Impact ($mms) of MA CY2027 Rule (STAR Proposals) showing Calendar Year, Net Impact Star Ratings Updates, and Percent of Medicare Payments to Private Health Plans from 2027-2036]

• While we stop short of suggesting that the current Trump Administration will be as conducive to MA as the first term (e.g. risk adjustment), recent actions have tilted positively
  ○ Final CY2026 MA Rule: In April 2025, the Trump Administration refrained from finalizing proposals that would have increased regulatory scrutiny over MA marketing and prior authorizations
  ○ Final 2026 Rates: The MA rate update was finalized at 5.06% (prior to coding) for 2026, up a strong 283bps from the prelim (which was set by the Biden Administration)
  • Key Caveat: Rates were essentially finalized as proposed, with the sole exception being the higher effective growth rate, which is calculated by the independent Office of the Actuary
  ○ Proposed CY2027 MA Rule: The Administration released a proposed rule walking back the EHQ4all reward factor, resulting in a material benefit to MA payments (~80bps) in 2028
  • Key Caveat: CMS now expects to maintain the current reward factor methodology in 2028, which is a benefit relative to the baseline (which assumed a switchover to EHQ4all) but not really an incremental year-over-year boost to payments

• UnitedHealth has also spoken positively about the administration, suggest on the 3Q25 call that "we continue to be very encouraged of the receptivity of this administration to have conversations with industry about ways to modernize and ways to improve this already very popular program. This is in direct contrast to what we experienced over the previous administration."

• After mispricing in 2025, there are signs that the competitive environment is becoming more rational for 2026
  ○ Looking at a recent survey of over 30 MA plan leaders, ~61% noted that profitability was now a top 3 concern for the MA industry
  ○ Given heightened concerns around profitability, ~100% of respondents ranked cost/financial sustainability as a top 3 priority for their MA business
  ○ Growth has clearly been deprioritized, with ~56% of respondents citing growing their existing portfolio as a top 3 priority, while just ~16% said the same with respect to service area expansion

• Importantly, UnitedHealth has provided cover for the industry to reprice more substantially in 2026
  ○ In recent years, plans had to weigh repricing against the omnipresent threat of UnitedHealth
  ○ This dynamic is changing next year, as UnitedHealth very visibly raised a white flag in early 2025 and warned of significant benefit actions in 2026. The message to the rest of the industry was very clear: Do not mess this up again for 2026!

• We are also seeing continued cooling in new entrant activity for 2026, as well as elevated plan exits

• The performance of new entrants has varied; however, new entrant cohorts have taken an average of ~31bps of market share by the end of their first year (increasing to just ~62bps by year 5)

• Based on the 2026 CMS landscape data, 9 new entities have filed to enter the MA market in 2026. However, when excluding new plans offered by public agencies in California, there is just 1 new entrant for 2026 (i.e. Elite Health Systems, Inc.)

• We also continue to hear about complete exits from the MA market in 2026 (more on this in next slide)

• In other words, we appear to be seeing some cooling in the competitive environment

  ○ Below, we provide a breakdown of plan exits dating back to January 2020. It is clear that exit activity in 2025 is much more active than typical, both in terms of the number of plans exiting the market and the amount of impacted lives
  ○ Putting numbers to it, there are a total of 9 companies completely exiting the MA market in 2025, with total enrollment of more than ~200K
  ○ Looking ahead, we see 5 companies completely exit the MA market for 2026, with total enrollment of ~74K. This would be closer to 109K if we were to also include the complete exit of Vermont Blue from that state's MA market (though parent BCBS of MI still offers plans in other states for 2026)

Future catalyst #5: MA plans maintain significant cushion to absorb future cuts

• In 2025, conventional plans are offering ~$188 worth of additional benefits compared to the FFS program (as measured by rebates)
  ○ Said another way, MA members were given $188 monthly in incentives (e.g. lower out of pockets costs and better supplemental benefits) to make the switch to MA. For perspective, this equates to nearly $2,260 of additional annual value from the average MA plan

• Even after two years of cuts, the MA industry still has more benefit cushion today than at nearly any other period in history. We believe this gives a LOT of wiggle room for the plans to navigate reimbursement challenges while still providing an attractive product to Medicare enrollees

[CHART: Average Monthly Rebate Across Medicare Advantage Under Various Reimbursement Scenarios showing historical data and projections under different cut scenarios (1%, 3%, 5% cuts) from 2010-2026E, with rebate amounts and MA Growth Rate percentages]

• In the chart below, we show what potential rebate compression in 2026 could look like under various reimbursement scenarios
  ○ If we assume MA plans take a 3% cut to their benefit package, that would reduce benefits by about $35 PMPM and leave a cushion of $153
  ○ Even if we though that plans had to reduce their benefit packages by 5%, closer to $58 PMPM, that would still leave a cushion of $130 PMPM relative to FFS
  ○ So under even a draconian assumption of 500bps of benefit reductions, the MA plans would be about as attractive as they were in 2020, when MA membership was growing at >9% y/y
  ○ Said another way, benefits are too generous currently but have room to recede while remaining attractive

[TABLE: % of SNPs Offering Supp Benefits, 2025-26 showing similar data for Special Needs Plans]

• MA plans have long been able to offer "primarily health-related" supplemental benefits not covered by FFS, such as vision, dental, gyms, and hearing coverage
  ○ Starting in plan year 2019, CMS expanded its definition of "primarily health-related" benefits, allowing plans to offer a broader swathe of supplemental benefits such as adult day care, caregiver support, more generous meal benefits, and additional transportation services
  ○ As of PY2020, MA plans were also permitted to offer Special Supplemental Benefits for the Chronically Ill (SSBCI). These benefits do not have to be primarily health-related (as long as they serve to reasonably improve or maintain an enrollee's health) and could be offered to certain beneficiaries with chronic conditions (e.g. diabetes)

• Despite the expectation for benefit cuts in 2026, many supplement benefits remain widespread
  ○ This includes telehealth benefits (offered by 99% of individual MA plans in 2026), vision (99%), dental (98%), hearing (98%), fitness (93%), OTC (66%), and meal benefits (58%)
  ○ While we are seeing some curtailment of other expanded supplemental benefits (e.g. nutrition, transportation), these were not as widely available in 2025. With respect to SSBCI, penetration remains low with just ~12% of individual plans offering at least one SSBCI, down from 16% in 2025.

Future catalyst #7: MA lowers beneficiary OOP costs at a time when the high cost of living is in focus

• Seniors are a notoriously price sensitive group, with nearly one in four Medicare beneficiaries living on incomes under $24.6K in 2024 (or about ~165% of the federal poverty line)

• According to data compiled by the Kaiser Family Foundation, about one in four Medicare beneficiaries also had savings below $19.0K per person in 2024

[CHART: Illustrative FFS Monthly Premiums (Medigap + PDP) showing breakdown of Part B ($203), Medigap ($241), PDP ($35), Total FFS ($478)]

• MA offers a compelling economic value to seniors, both in terms of lower monthly premiums and OOP costs. More importantly, this value proposition is accentuated during periods of high inflation and economic uncertainty

• In terms of premiums, CMS data suggests that ~99% of beneficiaries had access to a $0 premium MA-PD plan in 2025, and we would expect that percentage to remain high in 2025

• Beneficiaries enrolled in MA pay no Part D or Medigap premium and can actually receive monthly rebates for Part B costs. For perspective, assuming an $11 PMPM Part B rebate for 2026 (i.e. flat with 2025), the typical MA beneficiary in a $0 premium plan could see monthly premium costs of $192 in 2026

• To compare, the average standalone Part D premium will be $340.50 in 2026, putting total monthly premiums at $237 for an individual enrolled in original Medicare with drug coverage. If that individual was also enrolled in a Medigap plan, total monthly premiums could be closer to $478. Even if the FFS enrollee were to choose the cheapest PDP plan ($0 premium in 2026) and Medigap plan, monthly premiums will still be closer to $259

• Looking further at total out-of-pocket costs, an analysis conducted by Milliman shows that MA beneficiaries tend to have significantly lower out-of-pocket costs than their FFS counterparts.

• In 2024, Milliman estimates that average OOP costs for beneficiaries in MA was $272 per month
  ○ This was about ~29% lower than OOP costs of $382 per month in FFS

• Given the cost advantage of MA, the program has historically been weighted towards lower income and more price sensitive beneficiaries
  ○ Based on data from the 2022 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey, ~35% of MA enrollees lived on annual incomes below $20K (vs ~24% of FFS enrollees)

[TABLE: Utilization & Quality Outcomes Post Enrollment in Medicare (MA vs FFS) showing various metrics including Matched Cohorts, Mean Risk Scores, Chronic Condition Prevalence, and Top 10 Common Chronic Conditions with MA vs FFS comparisons and percentage differences]

• MA has repeatedly been proven to improve underlying cost of care, which provides a fundamental advantage that remains despite potential funding changes

• In June 2025, Inovalon published a study that tracked changes in healthcare utilization and quality metrics among comparable sets of beneficiaries during the two-year period post enrollment in either MA or FFS. This allowed the researchers to isolate the direct impacts of MA and FFS on utilization among similar individuals post enrollment
  ○ Overall, MA was shown to have better outcomes than FFS with respect to both healthcare utilization and quality metrics
  ○ During the two years post enrollment in Medicare, MA enrollees were shown to have 11% lower costs than a matched cohort of FFS enrollees, driven by lower inpatient admissions (-29% lower), total hospital days (-23%), per capita ED visits (-34%), observation stays (-21%), SNF days (-36%), LTACH days (-53%) and improvements across several other metrics
  ○ MA enrollees also appeared to exhibit better quality metrics than comparable FFS beneficiaries, with favorable readmissions rates (-56% lower), hospitalizations for potentially preventable conditions (-41% lower), and colorectal cancer screening (115% higher)

• MA's cost advantage relative to FFS should remain strong as value-based care penetration continues to increase

• Approximately 34.0% of MA provider payments were population-based in 2023, up from just 10.3% in 2017
  ○ We would expect continued growth in VBC penetration moving forward, especially in the areas of comprehensive risk arrangements and integrated finance/delivery system models (which represented a respective 24.2% and 6.9% of MA provider payments in 2023)

• This growth is significant, as value-based care tends to coincide with material improvements in both cost and utilization
  ○ According to a study published in JAMA, MA beneficiaries in two-sided risk models (up/downside risk) displayed significantly lower healthcare utilization than those in FFS
  ○ As shown in the following chart, MA enrollees in two-sided risk arrangements had all-cause hospitalization rates of 152.5 per 1K (-4.3% lower than FFS), observation stay rates of 79.2 per 1K (-7.6% lower than FFS), and ED visits of 375.8 per 1K (-13.4% lower than FFS)

Future catalyst #8: MA improves the underlying cost of care (continued...)

• MA's ability to improve care outcomes has led to a fundamental cost advantage relative to FFS that is clearly reflected in historical bidding data

• In 2025, MedPAC estimates that MA plan bids were 83% of the FFS benchmark (near a record low). Remember, the benchmark represents the max amount that CMS will pay a plan to provide the same services as FFS

• In other words, MA plans can provide the same core medical benefits required under Part A and Part B of Medicare for 17% less cost
  ○ This ratio has improved markedly over the past 10 years, with MA plans bidding at 85% of the FFS benchmark in 2022, 88% in 2020, and 94% in 2015

[CHART: Average Pre-Tax Margins, MA vs. D-SNP showing comparison data for 2018-2022 with MA and D-SNP margins, and Non-Profit D-SNP data]

• D-SNP growth has slowed in 2025, with total enrollment increasing just 0.8% YTD across our coverage and 2.8% YTD across the industry (vs overall MA growth of 3.1% YTD)
  ○ Remember, Humana estimates that redeterminations pressure on duals represented a ~70bps headwind to overall MA growth in 2024, as well as ~80bps in 2025 (due to the six-month grace period that D-SNP enrollees retain coverage after termination)
  ○ Dual eligible enrollment in C-SNPs has increased ~77K (57.8%) y/y in 2025 decelerating significantly from ~20K or 75.5% y/y in 2024

• That said, we note a couple of tailwinds that should benefit 2026:
  ○ Removal of the redeterminations-related headwind to growth
  ○ The wind-down of MMP programs starting in 2026, which currently enroll 24K lives (~3.6% of current D-SNP enrollment)
  ○ Plans appear to be shifting capacity/attention towards D-SNPs (and SNPs more generally), with Milliman estimating that the number of D-SNP plans offering in 2026 will increase 10.4% y/y (vs contraction of -9.1% y/y in non-SNP plans)

• Growth in D-SNP enrollment is important not only because of the larger premium dollars associated with high-risk enrollees, but also because of the product's favorable margin profile
  ○ According to MedPAC, average pre-tax margin for D-SNP plans was 7.5% in 2022 (the latest data available), compared to 3.6% for MA
  ○ Notably, that 7.5% margin includes non-profit D-SNP plans (which tend to run at lower margins), suggesting that the for-profit D-SNP margin is even higher than that level

[CHART: Percent of D-SNP Enrollment in States Where MCO Has No Medicaid Contract showing percentages for different companies: MOH (0%), CNC (7%), ELV (8%), UNH (17%), HUM (44%), CVS (50%)]

• Starting in 2027, CMS will require MCOs that offer D-SNP & Medicaid in the same service area to transition to FIDE/HIDE or face a ban on new enrollment. Interestingly, Coordination Only D-SNPs will still be allowed to enroll new membership in states where the parent does not also have a Medicaid contract

• In 2030, plans without Medicaid contracts would then cede duals members to those with such contracts

• As written, the rule presents the most risk for CVS and HUM, which have a respective 50% and 44% of current D-SNP enrollment in states without a Medicaid contract. We see the upside/downside risk as more favorable for Molina, Centene, and Elevance, which each have less than 10% of D-SNP enrollment in states without a Medicaid contract

• In reality, however, we see significant concerns around continuity of care, especially for vulnerable populations such as duals. As such, D-SNPs without Medicaid contracts could seek waivers from the states to allow continued enrollment of new duals in 2027 (as well as to prevent disenrollments in 2030). We also see other potential workarounds such as JVs or even M&A

• Medicaid enrollment is now ~85% penetrated by managed care organizations, yet HMOs only control ~57% of total Medicaid spend

• The percent of Medicaid spend managed by HMOs actually declined slightly in 2024, potentially driven by faster growth in unmanaged categories such as SNFs and professional services

• According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, adults aged 65+ and people with a disability accounted for 19% of Medicaid enrollment in 2023, but 51% of spending. These complex populations are where the largest opportunity exists
  ○ E.g. Medicaid LTSS comprised 6% of Medicaid enrollment but 34% of federal and state Medicaid spending in 2021
