Customer of Aizon

Interview conducted on January 31, 2022

Summary (Generated by Blue Heron)
The Expert is lead of analytics at Aggity, an international technology consultancy. He worked with Aizon in the context of a manufacturing optimization project with Interpharma, a relatively small pharmaceutical manufacturing company but one of the largest in Spain. The Expert describes Aizon as a valuable all-in-one software solution geared specifically to the pharma space, and he gives a mostly positive review to its technology as well as its advisory and support capabilities. For the project the Expert worked on, Aizon provided real-time data analysis of batch processing by analyzing data from bioreactors with over 200 sensors. At this volume of data ingestion, having a single analytics solution with a fixed cost adds value over having patchwork analysis tools on top of a separate cloud provider. However, the Expert notes some limitations of this model. Aizon only works with Amazon's cloud, and some companies with other cloud providers prefer not to work in multi-cloud environments. Further, it is likely only a value-add for large manufacturers; the Expert gives $100 million in annual revenue as the minimum. Other than minor suggestions about its frontend technology, the Expert has no other criticisms of Aizon and thinks it is uniquely positioned as an analytics provider for pharma.

Aizon evaluation

• The Expert works for a tech consultancy and is an expert in data science and modeling but has limited experience in pharma.
• He worked with Interpharma, a drug manufacturer, to deploy Aizon in a project aimed at improving the yield rate of bioreactors.
• The Expert does not specify how Interpharma selected Aizon as a solution but names its regulatory certifications, fixed-cost pricing model, and overall value proposition as key criteria for using it.
• The Expert is not aware of one-to-one competitors to Aizon. He notes that the regulatory approval of Aizon in the U.S and Europe creates a competitive moat.
• The Expert is aware of analytics tools, cloud data management platforms, and other SaaS products that could be used to construct a patchwork alternative to Aizon, but these would likely not produce the same valuable business case.
• Aizon's primary advantage is the ability to monitor real-time data at scale.
  ◦ "Their value proposition is continuous knowledge and a continuous improving of the manufacturing process."
• In the Interpharma use case, Aizon identified root causes of problems that affected the volume of drug materials being yielded by the manufacturing process.
• The Aizon team is energetic, young, and has impressive expertise in pharma manufacturing. The Expert mentions that he enjoyed working with Aizon because of these qualities.
• At scale, using Aizon analytics to optimize manufacturing potentially translates to millions in savings.
  ◦ "For example, maybe you are working with an expensive product, a molecule that costs $10,000 per gram. And there is a business case that says, if we could improve the yield by 3.5%, then it could bring back millions of dollars in profit."
• The Expert cannot specify Interpharma's precise spend on Aizon but throws out $200,000 per year as an example of an annual spend that would be prohibitive for a smaller manufacturer.
• An advantage of Aizon's pricing model is that it rolls data storage costs into the same fixed-cost license as the analytics product.
• This is likely a better value, the Expert thinks, than paying a per-usage analytics tool while paying for a cloud database tool separately.
• Aizon has APIs that allow for easy integration with other analytics tools.
• Customer support at Aizon is described as very good.
• The proof of concept with Aizon took about three months, with another three months for a full implementation.

Tone: Positive

Blue Heron
Tell me about yourself and what you do in your company.

Aizon Customer
I collaborated with Aizon in deploying projects for Interpharma, a pharma company. Interpharma is one of the biggest pharmaceutical companies in Spain. They were interested in analyzing how they could improve the yield of their bioreactors and of their molecules that they grow in bioreactors.

Before that, I had never seen Aizon's platform. I participated in the full project before talking requirements with the customer. Afterwards, we collaborated with Aizon, and I was deploying models with them, analyzing data for all the processes of the bioreactor.

In the second phase we were integrating the data, analyzing it, and creating and deploying models. We have a very good partner in Aizon. Their software helped simplify the analytical process. We can read all the information about the bioreactors in a fast way. It integrates all the data so we can employ our time in analyzing trends, analyzing all the signals that the machines send to us.

Another thing I like very much is that the software is very oriented to pharma. It's created by people who know very well the challenges that the chemical industry or the pharmaceutical industry faces. They are not surrounding the problem. They attack the problem directly. We can obtain results in three months, and the results were incredible.

Another strength of Aizon is the consulting. They are experts in this context. For example, it was my first time working in the pharma industry. I have lots of experience in data. I've worked for around 20 years in modeling, data mining, and machine learning. But I never worked in this field. The subject experts say to me, "Javier, did you see a good signal?" I can say, "Yes, I did, look at this data," which corresponds to something obvious to the customer.

It's a very good mix. On one hand, they provide a very good tool that simplifies the process of visualizing and putting in production the control of a bioreactor or what I work with the -- bioreaction application. On the other hand, they know the pharma industry and the processes very well.

Blue Heron
We're talking about the batch production and ensuring that everything runs very smoothly, working with data and ensuring there are no problems with the batches. You're saying that Aizon gets right to the problem.

Aizon Customer
Yes, exactly. They get right to the problem, and they don't go around it. They know very well the main indicators that can lead to resolving the problem. I was surprised in the first days when they started. I was surprised by the confidence in the Aizon team in obtaining a good result of the application. We ultimately got it. They were very confident that they had a good way to test and improve the industrial process for pharma. Very surprising to me. When I reported problems they would say, "Don't worry. We'll find the root cause."

Blue Heron
By the root cause, you mean the root cause of a problem that would have caused a batch to fail.

Aizon Customer
Yes.

Blue Heron
They were able to give you intelligence on why that happened and fix it.

Aizon Customer
Yes. Absolutely. I was impressed by their confidence. They have a lot of experience in these kind of projects. They are very focused. They are young, with a lot of energy. I enjoyed working with them because they enjoyed the project with the batches. They were interested in looking at this process and finding why the reactor reacted in error, and they were interested in the causes, and you need to be. I love these kinds of people who like their job.

Blue Heron
They came across as genuine and willing to help you problem solve.

Aizon Customer
Yes.

Blue Heron
What were the most important criteria for deciding to use Aizon?

Aizon Customer
The business case. There are three reasons for including Aizon in your technology stack. The first one is that they have protocols. They are authorized by the Europeans and the United States for working with pharmacological data. On the other hand, they look for a business case that satisfies your expectations. For example, maybe you are working with an expensive product, a molecule that costs $10,000 per gram. And there is a business case that says, if we could improve the yield by 3.5%, then it could bring back millions of dollars in profit. It's incredible. If you improve a single 1%, then you are speaking about millions of dollars of profit.

Maybe it's expensive software, but you get the advantage of simplifying things by having it in one software, for what this product costs you. You pay a certain amount, and it includes storage and software, and you don't have to worry about any other parts going into your budget. I don't know the exact amount. But it is very good. Sometimes companies offer you a product where you pay a little money, a few dollars, but if you use it in the wrong way or if the project goes wrong, maybe you spend a lot of money on something else and don't have a fixed budget.

Blue Heron
How long would you say it takes to implement Aizon? How long would it take for a company to onboard Aizon and start using it?

Aizon Customer
Three months. In three months, you have a proof of concept with one real case, with the readings and obtaining conclusions. It's very fast. They have models -- a schedule and their structures and process -- so that in very little time, you can obtain conclusions.

The productivity state is maybe another three months more. But obtaining the first conclusion only takes three months.

Is there much training that is required for staff to use Aizon? Is it very difficult for people to get to know?

Aizon Customer
No, it's not difficult. It's a plug-and-play software. You don't need to worry about the platform. It's on Amazon Web Services. You can deploy and use it. It's a user-friendly application where you can drag and drop the functionalities. You put your graph in and say, "I want to see the correlation between these variables." Okay. I look for the function that shows you the correlation. I drag and drop into the workspace where I'm working, and I have these conclusions.

The hardest part is the integration of the data. And in this part, I think it's very good or mandatory that Aizon's IT department helps the company to know the process to integrate the data. This is because the real value of Aizon is when the data is in real time. Their platform is ingesting the data real-time. And the models are running and show the customer if their batch will be very good or have problems. For example, if the yield of the batch isn't as good as we expected, what are the measures that you can take? This is maybe one of the most important phases -- it's the integration of the data, the ETL [extract, transform, load] of the data. In this part, at least for the first time, it's good that Aizon's IT team helps with the integration. But the use of the platform when the information is integrated is very, very simple.

You don't need to be a data scientist to use it. But it's very important to be a subject expert, because there is a lot of information where only a subject expert can get the value.

Blue Heron
It sounds like the customer service or support is there to hold your hand and check that everything is going correctly.

Aizon Customer
Yes. They have very good customer support. They are very interested in seeing that customers get value from their software. And they know that only giving value to customers will allow them to sell this product. The license is per year, and they need the customer to get value every year they have the Aizon software. They are very concerned about the business case: Can we help the customer keep a lot of money?

My experience with them has been very, very good. I'm a senior data scientist, and I have participated in more than 50 analytical projects in a lot of companies, and having this software was a very great surprise to me. And the company gives me a lot of confidence in what they are doing, their roadmap.

Blue Heron
Who are the main competitors to Aizon, as far as you are aware?

Aizon Customer
Maybe there are a lot of competitors that I don't know about. I work with a lot of SaaS software. It is important. But I don't have enough information about this. I know that the things I made in the Interpharma project with Aizon software could be replicated with other software, but I don't know other software that is so oriented to pharmaceutical industry problems. Maybe I can do a lot of things in Python software, but it's not the same. Maybe you spend more time and more money deploying the things that Aizon has solved. I don't know that in this industry there is other software that competes with Aizon.

Blue Heron
Aizon sounds like a unique solution.

Aizon Customer
Yes, I think they have a very good solution. There are different platforms for the pharma industry. And this is one thing that you can't get easily with other software. There are a lot of things that you can build with free software, for example, but you don't have this certification, and this is one of the most important things. This

is a very high entry barrier for other companies. I don't know how many software companies in the market have the certification.

Blue Heron
Are there any areas where Aizon could improve?

Aizon Customer
Yes, they are improving their frontend. They have a fairly good frontend, but they are adding new capabilities. For example, a new analytics interface or new visualizing graphs. When I was working with them, I proposed including a kind of graph, because this can help customers. They told me it was on their roadmap. This is a software that is improving. Maybe they need to offer more resources, but this is their direction.

Another thing is that they offer their solution in Amazon Web Services. Sometimes companies work with Azure or Google Cloud Platform. There are companies that don't want to be in a multi-cloud environment. That's another thing that maybe they should improve.

Another thing may be to offer more connectivity to tablets or phones. Offer a more integrated solution for mobiles or tablets. They are very concentrated on the manufacturing process, and maybe it's more important to focus on that. I don't know if I explained that well.

Blue Heron
If they perhaps had an app, would that be helpful for using a tablet or mobile phone to monitor what's on the floor? Because the data is being analyzed in real time, maybe having that capability would be an advantage.

Aizon Customer
Real time is one of the main advantages of the Aizon platform. With their application, you can look at it from a mobile device, but the experience is not as good as if you look at your PC. Design the app for another device. Your wireless screen is smaller than my PC, and the information that's on the Aizon app needs to be shown in a different way. It's the same information, but you need to show it differently to improve the user experience -- the mobile experience compared to the PC experience.

Blue Heron
Visualize the data in a different manner for mobile.

Aizon Customer
Yes.

Blue Heron
How would you describe the ROI of Aizon? It sounds like one way ROI is realized is through money saved by improving the quality of the batches that are produced.

Aizon Customer
I work on batch produced with Aizon. Their value proposition is continuous knowledge and a continuous improving of the manufacturing process. For this, real-time is very important. In each moment, the customer knows if their batch is working well, and they have an expectation of the yield that the batch will produce. Aizon tries to put in a holistic process. They try to understand the whole process downstream of manufacturing. And this is very important, because sometimes you only see effects in the upstream process. But maybe it was influenced by the downstream process. I don't know if I explained that well.

One of the main advantages is that they put a holistic scenario in place and put it in real time. In each moment, they know if the process -- the batch processing -- is working well or not. I think the main benefits of Aizon are located when there is a costly manufacturing process. Like drug manufacturing. Because when

your batches are very expensive, maybe if you obtain higher yield you'll improve your revenue, and you can easily pay the software's cost.

Blue Heron
If you save money because there are fewer problems, then the software pays for itself. Could Aizon be used with other products and platforms?

Aizon Customer
Yes. It has a lot of APIs that can communicate. You can send information to other applications via API. This implies that you can integrate the Aizon platform with other analytical platforms.

Blue Heron
Do you think the price would deter companies from using Aizon?

Aizon Customer
The first moment you see the cost of Aizon, maybe you would think that it's very expensive. People seeing it for the first time might not know that the Aizon license implies not only software; it implies all the cloud infrastructure. You don't pay Amazon Web Services -- the cost of storage, the cost of computation, the cost of deploying. All the costs are included in the Aizon license. And it's a fixed cost. And it seems that when customers know that, their perceptions change. Sometimes you can use a software -- a free software -- that you pay only by your use. But sometimes the usage rate becomes more expensive than a fixed cost. For example, we could work with free software or with a free architecture that only costs money if I use it. But when you choose a transactional amount that is the amount that you need to put real-time data in action, you are exposed to a very high cost. In our case, this would be because of all the sensors of the machine. One bioreactor could have 200 sensors sending information to the Aizon platform. And you need to store it and process it, and that is maybe a high cost.

Another thing is that in my experience with Aizon, they look for the points where the software can be an advantage and give the company good results. They know that if the software doesn't give value to the company, that they are losing time, because then the customer doesn't renew the software license. And that is very important, and this is critical for taking action. Real time is good, but real time is only good when it helps companies to make good decisions with the data.

Blue Heron
Is Aizon applicable to a company of any size, or is it better suited to bigger companies?

Aizon Customer
I don't see Aizon in companies that have revenues of less than $100 million. I think that it needs some quantities. It's very oriented for pharmaceutical industries that are big. Or small laboratories -- but, they need to have a minimum size. Maybe paying them $200,000 per year is not possible for a small company. I think that in the U.S. the companies are bigger than in Spain. But in Spain, there are companies that only have revenues around €90 million. You need volume for it to make business sense.

Blue Heron
