## Data Monetization Value

**Protecting current data assets and capturing new differentiated data types through partnerships can help maximize the value of our data**

---

### Data Value Quadrant Chart

This chart visualizes data types based on two axes:
*   **Horizontal Axis (X-axis): Size of data**
    *   "How much data (often in terms of # of patients) is needed to become valuable and differentiated" (Increases from left to right, meaning more commoditized data is on the right, and more differentiated/smaller value data is on the left.)
*   **Vertical Axis (Y-axis): Curation**
    *   "How much work is needed on top of the raw data to become valuable" (Increases from bottom to top)

**Data Types and Estimated Annual License Cost per Patient (where available):**

#### High Curation, Differentiated (Smaller Size / High Value) Data (Top-Left and Mid-Left Area)
*   **Unstructured EHR data (Rare diseases)**: $200-2000
*   **Genomic Data (General and Rare Disease)**: $200-2000
*   **Imaging**
*   **Wearables + PROS**
*   **Registry Data**: $50-100
*   **Retrospective Clinical Trial Data**
*   **Structured EHR data (rare disease)**: $50-1000

#### High Curation, Commoditized (Large Size) Data (Top-Right Area)
*   **Unstructured EHR data**: $10-50

#### Low Curation, Commoditized (Large Size) Data (Bottom-Right Area)
*   **Structured EHR data**: ~$.05-1.0
*   **Closed claims data**: ~$.01-.5
*   **Provider Data**
*   **Open claims data**: ~$.005-.05
*   **Pharmacy Data**: ~$.01-.5

### New Opportunities:
Small, highly curated and differentiated data sets have high value in the market. CVS can leverage its patient reach and current data sets to move into this area combined with solutions of specialized partners.

### CVS Today:
CVS's current data play is based on the size of its data sets - and these data sets are increasingly commoditized. This value proposition can be protected by adding additional value by **increasing longitudinal linkage with other sources and targeted analytics** (such as for quality improvement) on top of these sources.
