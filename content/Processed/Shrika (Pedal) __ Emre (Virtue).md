### Company Background & Approach

- Shrika’s background: parents were aquaculture farmers, did ag/chem research through high school
	- MIT computer science + autonomous systems, worked on drone navigation for army
	- Apple internship on Vision Pro team (hardware/software)
	- Returned to life sciences with new perspective on automation bottlenecks
- Core thesis: “Cursor vs Cognition” approach to autonomous labs
	- Taking human-in-the-loop approach first (like Cursor) vs pure automation
	- Building interface that changes how scientists interact with data/machines
	- Aggregating tacit knowledge to eventually train RL models for full autonomy
- Current focus: small molecule R&D + manufacturing (Pfizer Smart Labs team)

### Product & Customer Use Cases

- Problem: current Pfizer workflow is highly fragmented
	- Scientists write SOPs in Word docs → weeks of back-and-forth with automation engineers
	- Data scattered across systems, informal handoffs via messy documents
	- Computational teams build siloed models disconnected from wet lab
- Pedal solution: single interface converting intent into robotic execution
	- “Going from ‘I want to normalize this plate to 2 molar concentration’ to actually doing that”
	- Tightly couples active learning with experimental design
	- Verifies/standardizes data to enable efficient design space search
- GTM strategy inspired by Benchling: land grab motion
	- Academic trickle-down effect (MIT/Harvard labs)
	- Combined PLG + top-down C-suite sales approach
	- Long-term vision: every published paper includes Pedal repository link

### Funding Status

- Raising ~$5M round, currently finalizing lead investor
- Box Group: sent uncapped SAFE converting at round price
- Sabrina Hahn verbally committed
- Multiple firms in final discussions for lead position
- Round coming to close this week
