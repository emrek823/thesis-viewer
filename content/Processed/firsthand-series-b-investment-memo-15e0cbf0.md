12/4 Addendum: Note that the team did not end up making this investment.

## Deal Overview
We are recommending GC invests $25M in Firsthand out of a Series B raise of $35M at $160M post for ownership of ~15.6% of the business. This is a highly competitive process, given the quality of the team and the initial traction. To address that, we would like a mandate to explore investing up to $30M in a $50M raise at a valuation of up to $200M post if required to win the deal. Firsthand is building a community-based, peer support-led engagement model for individuals with serious mental illness, a population that has historically been difficult to track down, develop trust with, and engage longitudinally. They are also expensive, with an estimated lifetime burden of $1.85 million per SMI patient.¹ Despite the economic incentives to better serve this population and drive down cost as a result, most providers have actively carved out this risk.

Firsthand's hypothesis is that the major limiting factor to appropriately managing this population is lack of trust, as individuals have historically been failed by the system. Firsthand provides a way for payers to close this trust gap, employing peers with lived experiences who are seen as credible, trustworthy, and signs of hope by this population. The peers, along with a team of social workers and nurse practitioners, then help uncover unaddressed care gaps, guide individuals to the right clinical resources, and even enroll them in additional social services and benefits that accrue value to the individual, their payer, and Firsthand.

Based on our experiences investing in a range of value-based care delivery companies that serve vulnerable populations (e.g. Cityblock, Eleanor), we have high conviction in Firsthand's hypothesis. Even with the best clinical models, if you can't engage an individual you can't succeed in risk. It's truly a first order problem when serving vulnerable populations. Importantly, we like that Firsthand is not aiming to provide clinical services, which positions them to be best-in-class at engagement and act as a complement to downstream providers. This results in less friction with payers and other value-based providers since Firsthand isn't competing with their existing clinical networks.

Firsthand also fits nicely within our behavioral health thesis and existing portfolio of solutions. While Cityblock and Eleanor both manage members with SMI (an estimated 20% of their member bases), SMI is typically a comorbidity, not a primary diagnosis, and leaves room for a dedicated SMI solution. Furthermore, since Firsthand is focused on engagement and 'top-of-funnel', we see synergies where these companies could be really effective partners with one another.

We've been building a relationship with the CEO and Co-Founder, Samir Malik, since the beginning of this year. Over the past few weeks, we have spent considerable time with multiple members of the Firsthand management team for formal diligence. Candace also went to Cleveland, OH for a site visit where she spent time with Firsthand's field team. We have been impressed by their backgrounds and thoughtfulness around how to build a successful and sustainable community-based engagement model for SMI individuals. Though still in early days, the company has already shown impressive traction and results across its initial markets, with clear pathway towards $10M of topline revenue in 2023, the first full year of operations, potentially scaling to $270M of revenue and $40M of EBITDA by 2027. With reasonable assumptions around growth and margin expansion (as well as remaining in a shared savings rather than total cost of care risk construct) and a 7-8 year holding period (typical for value-based services businesses), we think that this can become a 10x MOIC outcome, even at the high end of our valuation range.

## Background on Serious Mental Illness (SMI)
Serious mental illness (SMI) is defined as a mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder resulting in serious functional impairment that substantially interferes with major life activities (e.g., eating, bathing, managing money) and overall functioning within social, family, and vocational / educational contexts. Common diagnoses associated with SMI include bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, and schizoaffective disorder.

In 2020, there were an estimated 14.2 million SMI individuals in the U.S., a figure that represents 5.6% of all U.S. adults.² Even though evidence-based SMI protocols are established in literature, access to and engagement in basic care is low, causing individuals to deteriorate and require intensive medical intervention. As a result, this population is both high cost (annual spend totalling ~$265-280B³) and undermanaged - of the total SMI population, it is estimated that only ~9 million (or ~65%) received mental health treatment (e.g., inpatient or outpatient treatment / counseling, prescription medication usage).⁴

Unsurprisingly, outcomes are far worse for SMI individuals than those without SMI. On average, people with SMI die 20 years younger than their peers⁵ and are twice as likely to suffer from higher rates of preventable disease.⁶ These individuals also often face a multitude of SDOH challenges, including higher rates of homelessness, food insecurity, and unemployment.

## Firsthand Investment Thesis
*   **Highly Effective and Cost Efficient Peer Workforce:** We like Firsthand's focus on providing community-based, best-in-class peer support for several reasons. First, peer support is widely recognized as best practice and backed by research because it effectively builds trust; however, staffing and scaling peer support teams is not easy, and payers like Optum have traditionally struggled to do this in-house. Second, Firsthand can tap into a diverse array of candidates when looking for peers - unlike with other behavioral health providers, a wider labor pool is eligible to be part of this workforce. Third, people often find the community-based peer support role to be more holistic and rewarding than their other options (e.g., case workers, group therapy leaders). This means the likelihood of successfully recruiting and scaling such a model is higher than traditional forms of therapy. To date, Firsthand has brought 120 employees on board with only seven voluntary departures (largely due to other opportunities) and five involuntary departures.
*   **Strong Engagement & Care Navigation in Competitive Whitespace:** The population and model that Firsthand is targeting has historically been whitespace - no one has wanted to manage this population. Even providers willing to take on this risk (Cityblock, Eleanor) have run into engagement issues early on. We view Firsthand's approach as more favorable than building out a full-stack clinical services business, as this also creates less friction with the traditional healthcare delivery system. Additionally, Firsthand's social benefits navigation and enrollment capabilities are unique in this space and further differentiate the value they can provide to their members and health plan customers. While we are not underwriting this investment to a total cost of care model (and believe it is highly attractive remaining in a PEMPM and shared savings construct), there is opportunity for Firsthand to hold that bag of risk since this population is largely unmanaged, if they can prove engagement and outcomes.
*   **Impressive Initial Payor Traction:** In its first year, Firsthand already has three-value based contracts with UnitedHealthcare (covering 55K attributed lives). This is highly unusual traction at this stage with such a large and important payer and points to confidence in the team and their advisors. Firsthand was incubated by Triple Aim Partners, whose founder was a CEO of OptumHealth for a while after selling his previous business, SCA Health, to them; furthermore, co-founder Samir also sold his previous business to Optum. Based on our conversations with other payors, we also see broad appetite for Firsthand's offerings beyond United, and the company is already receiving considerable inbound interest. However, they are being measured and prudent about using their initial markets to build a sophisticated operational playbook before expanding broadly.
*   **Strong Business Model and Early Execution:** Initial signs point to strong execution of Firsthand's playbook - the team has achieved 50% engagement among initial cohorts (vs. 20% originally budgeted based on prior best practices) and have systematically identified three clear levers to drive value (medical expense savings, clinical documentation, and SSI/SSDI enrollment), all of which serve as additional revenue streams for the payors initially (and for Firsthand later if they shift to total cost of care). In particular, the ability to enroll members into SSI/SSDI for rate cell optimization is unique in this space. Lastly, the team has a clear pathway towards positive unit economics on a care pod level in just a PEMPM construct (no additional shared savings or value creation levers on top) and expects pods to breakeven cumulatively ~11 months after start.
*   **Exceptional Team with Relevant Experience / Backgrounds:** Throughout our diligence process, we have engaged with multiple members of the Firsthand team and been highly impressed by them all. Co-founder Samir is a commercially minded, second-time founder who exited his previous company in the tele-psychiatry space and who references incredibly well. The other co-founder Ananth has relevant value-based care experience as GM of MA at Oscar Health and at Centene. For a company at this stage, they have surrounded themselves with a deep bench of team members with value-based care and healthcare services experience.

## Company Overview
Firsthand is building a peer support-based care navigation and engagement model for those struggling with SMI. Its target customers today are health plans (specifically MCOs) who are looking for a wrap layer around their existing clinical services and provider network. The team believes that by finding, establishing trust, and supporting this historically difficult-to-engage population, health outcomes and quality of life for these individuals will dramatically improve.

Furthermore, by providing ongoing engagement and support, Firsthand is able to manage the overutilization of high-cost care by this population, thereby improving health plan economics through medical expense savings (lower ER/inpatient utilization and shift to outpatient care settings). The team also provides other value to health plans (e.g., benefits enrollment, appropriate documentation) that drive additional revenue to the plans, improve member satisfaction and retention, and ensure that SMI individuals are being fully cared for in all parts of life.

Firsthand's target population today is the 3.5M eligible duals, Medicare, and Managed Medicaid members who have $20K+ p.a. in medical expenses and complex SMI diagnoses in the U.S. The company officially launched its first market (Tennessee) in summer 2022.

## Revenue Model
Firsthand is fully fee-based today and receives $575 per engaged member per month (PEMPM) from health plans. Additionally, Firsthand will split shared savings with the health plan 50/50.

The plan is after 18-24 months from market launch, Firsthand will move into full capitation risk of its risk-attributed lives (contingent on continued above market engagement rates); however, the company is not wedded to this plan if data shows that a shared savings model makes more sense. That said, Firsthand is thinking about risk stratification in a very sophisticated way. If they pull it off, they will be able to hone in on specific phenotypes that are highly impactable and engageable, and then carve out total cost of care risk on that population in particular. In theory, this is a much easier route than taking total cost of care risk on a larger, heterogeneous population, which is what most VBC services providers (e.g., Cityblock, Eleanor) are doing.

Firsthand believes that its engagement model can deliver ~$150 PEMPM net value creation through three primary levers - it's important to note that while these predominantly accrue to the health plan initially, they become part of Firsthand's P&L upon transition to risk:
1.  MedEx Savings (assumed 25% total cost of care savings)
2.  Rate Cell Optimization (assumed 50% of TANF-enrolled Medicaid members could be converted to SSI)
3.  Clinical Documentation (assumed 40 bps of HCC lift)

As will be described below, Firsthand is tracking well towards (and sometimes even exceeding) the above assumptions.

## Care Pods
The company leverages community-based care pods comprised of 10 team members to engage members:
*   **Six peers ('Firsthand Guides')**, with lived experiences who focus on engaging / building trust with the members,
*   **Two social workers ('Community Resources Guides')**, who support enrollment into benefit programs related to SDOH (e.g., transit vouchers, housing, etc.) and manage care coordination / navigation,
*   **One nurse practitioner ('Health Guide')**, who performs health assessments, ensures robust clinical documentation, and refers to specialists as needed, and
*   **One manager ('Guide Team Lead')** to oversee the care pod.

### firsthand Care Team
*   **Peer**
    *   Focused on engaging the unengaged and building trusting relationships with target members
*   **Social Worker**
    *   Support enrollment in benefit programs and navigate members to CMHC partners, other OP BH services, and SDOH resources
*   **Nurse Practitioner**
    *   Perform whole-person health assessments and refer to specialists to manage chronic conditions

Each care pod can be fully staffed and trained within 45 days. Training follows best practices developed by the Mental Health America and National Council for Mental Well-Being; is specialized for each role; and includes online modules, in-person classroom training, and job shadowing with colleagues. Once optimized and at full capacity, care pods can serve ~270-300 engaged members, meaning each peer ('Firsthand Guide') oversees ~45-50 members. The Firsthand team constantly assesses viability for new pods in each market and begins to discuss market expansion plans early (once existing pods reach ~20-30% capacity) in order to have enough time to stand up the right management and care pod teams.

The team has been highly intentional about each team role, the type of profile they are seeking, and the scope of roles & responsibilities:
*   **Peers ('Firsthand Guides')** are Certified Peer Recovery Specialist (CPRS)-certified individuals who are in SMI/SUD recovery themselves and thus have the lived experience that members are going through. They are also often part of the same micro-communities specific to Firsthand's members. These peers are responsible for building trust, maintaining ongoing engagement, and quarterbacking the rest of the care team.
    *   It's important to underscore that Firsthand's peers are actively in the community as coaches/guides for their individuals (vs. being static group facilitators, as in other models)
    *   There is also a powerful flywheel effect with Firsthand's peer support model, as Firsthand can provide employment opportunities to members in recovery who would like to work as peers. Particularly given that a large struggle for peer support models is recruitment and retention of peers, this serves as a strong and sticky hiring funnel.
*   **Social workers ('Community Resources Guides')** manage care coordination and continuity of care in partnership with care management services for engaged members. They are responsible for supporting enrollment into programs like Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and referring members to outpatient services, CMHC/FQHC partners, and SDoH resources (e.g., supportive housing, employment agencies, peer clubhouses, etc.).
*   **Nurse practitioners ('Health Guides')** develop comprehensive care plans for members that are shared with relevant medical and behavioral health providers. This is often the result of an initial multi-hour whole person assessment, during which the NP ensures that a member's conditions are comprehensively captured and documented.
    *   Firsthand's in-house clinical infrastructure is light (as the primary goal is to utilize payer networks for medical and behavioral care), but these NPs play a crucial role for the entire ecosystem of care providers that manage SMI individuals. This population is often poorly understood from a medical history and coding perspective, which is compounded by complications resulting from high rates of medical comorbidities (~85%).

Given this care model, reliable and retainable team members are crucial for Firsthand's long-term success. Though the company is still in early days, their recent NPS survey (N=71 of 102) so far has 95% favorable engagement, which we think speaks to the strong culture that management has prioritized building since the beginning.

## Patient Journey
There are six key stages / components of Firsthand's patient journey for individuals with SMI:
1.  **Find and engage:** Firsthand's community-based team of peers and social workers physically finds, engages, and builds relationships with high-cost SMI members that are traditionally 'un-engageable' by health plans.
    a. Firsthand's data science team helps mine claims datasets, ADT feeds, etc. to triangulate where members could be. This may mean sending a peer to a Walmart pharmacy that the member frequents and leaving his/her phone number.
    b. Note that only *after* an individual signs the Firsthand consent form does Firsthand start to collect a PEMPM fee. If Firsthand cannot engage a member at least once in a six-month period, that member would be disenrolled, and Firsthand would no longer collect the PEMPM fee.
2.  **Clinical assessment & triage:** Once enrolled, Firsthand's community-based nurse practitioners perform whole-person clinical reviews to identify their needs and make sure members are properly clinically documented.
3.  **Outpatient navigation & continuity of care:** Additionally, Firsthand helps enrolled members choose follow-on care providers from payors' existing network of physicians and its own network of high-quality community partners. This network of community mental health centers (CMHCs) and federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) is curated and vetted for member fit, evidence-based program design, and history of positive member outcomes.
    a. With each new market, Firsthand selects 2-4 preferred primary care physicians who are more likely to provide better care for individuals with SMI and offer ancillary benefits like expedited intake, support for after-hours care.
    b. Plugging these individuals into basic care and community care options is an important service, as nearly 40% of individuals with SMI who do not receive care cite 'do not know where to go for services' as the top reason for lack of treatment.⁷ As a reminder, consistent undertreatment is often a key driving factor behind overutilization of overly high-cost care for this population.
    c. Firsthand peers often accompany members to their appointments, further increasing the trust between Firsthand and its members as well as the transparency between the provider and patient
4.  **SSA, housing, and nutrition benefits enrollment:** Firsthand's social workers support engaged members in applying for government safety net programs for housing, nutrition, transportation, and job assistance. A key program that Firsthand helps enroll eligible members in is Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI), which can provide up to $800 in additional monthly benefit income. SMI is the single highest volume clinical qualification into SSDI/SSI programs, and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) and Aged, Blind, and Disabled (ABD) recipients are more likely to qualify.
    a. However, the application for SSI/SSDI has historically been difficult, requiring extensive medical records, work history, financial history, and interviews from family and others. This has led the federal government to invest in the SSI/SSDI Outreach, Access, and Recovery (SOAR) program to improve SSI and SSDI enrollments for those in need. The SSI/SSDI approval rate for applications completed by SOAR-certified social workers is 65% (vs. baseline approval rate of 30%), and Firsthand is investing in SOAR certification for all of its social workers
    b. The enrollment process for SSI/SSDI and other benefits will also serve as a key lever to deepen trust between Firsthand and its members
5.  **SDOH activation & support:** Firsthand will also build partnerships with local SDOH resources to plug quality-of-life gaps for members.
6.  **Quality measures:** Through the above, Firsthand aims to improve performance on key quality measures for health plans. This includes a subset of seven SMI-focused and one SUD-focused HEDIS measures, which are used to measure performance on important dimensions of care and service by health plans. These are crucial to health plans, as top-tier rated plans enjoy preferred auto-assignment and increases in capitation rates at the plan level.
    a. These measures are: FUH (Follow-Up After Hospitalization for Mental Illness); FUM (Follow-Up After Emergency Department Visit for Mental Illness); SAA (Adherence to Antipsychotic Medications for Individuals With Schizophrenia); SSD (Diabetes Screening for People With Schizophrenia or Bipolar Disorder Who Are Using Antipsychotic Medications); SMD (Diabetes Monitoring for People With Diabetes and Schizophrenia); SMC (Cardiovascular Monitoring for People With Cardiovascular Disease and Schizophrenia); IAD (Identification of Alcohol and Other Drug Services);

## Tech Stack
The team's approach to technology thus far has been a heavy leaning towards third-party solutions, with the desire to only invest in internal builds where they have IP and can drive meaningful upside to engagement / savings. By solving problems with humans first, the team has been able to 1) understand the real needs of its population (both members and care teams; 2) partner with vendors for already solved and optimized problems; and 3) deploy internal resources only towards innovative, proprietary solutions that increase Firsthand's differentiation, defensibility, and/or scale efficiencies. This reliance on a buy (vs. build) tech philosophy largely stems from the Head of Engineering's learnings at Cityblock as Founding Engineer, at a time when off-the-shelf solutions were less abundant and sophisticated.

A crucial part of the use of funds from this raise will be towards addressing that third bucket and building out internal tools to support a 'modern, empowered peer team.' Several opportunities that the team has identified for internal tech build to scale the business include:
*   Member stratification on engageability algorithms
*   SSI enablement workflow tools to support assessment and cross-functional team collaboration
*   Panel management tools to facilitate pod-huddles and provide individual, pod, and guide-level recommendations
*   Self management tools for guides to conduct, triage, and develop care plans based on self assessment frameworks

In the interim, the company has partnered with:
*   **Data Ingestion:** Fivetran, aws, fdb (First Databank), TUVAHEALTH
*   **Data Cleanup:** Zus, dbt
*   **Member Stratification:** Zus
*   **Operational Reporting:** Ursa Health, Google Workspace, CLAIM MD, HEALTH GORILLA, surescripts, LexisNexis, ADVOCATIA, Canvas
*   **Other:** Empanelment, Pre-Charting, Interoperability, Consent Management, Outreach Enablement, Documentation, SSI/SSDI Enrollment, Orders & Referrals, Suspects Lists, Pop Health Analytics, Payer Reporting

## Traction & Progress to Date
Firsthand is live in seven markets across Tennessee, Ohio, and Florida through three-year contracts with UnitedHealthcare Managed Medicaid and Duals plans. Its contracts total ~55K attributed lives (26K in TN, 15K in OH, and 10K in FL), with the following clinical profiles:
*   Average 5.4 chronic conditions, ~50% of which have been unaddressed in the last 12 months
    *   Conditions include diabetes, fibrosis, vascular disease, morbid obesity, congestive heart failure, etc.
    *   Additionally, 28% have co-occurring substance abuse, which is likely an underreported figure
*   Average ~$2.5K PEMPM medical expenditure, 20% of which is on behavioral health services

It's worth noting that Firsthand has been highly data-driven about its market selection process, taking into consideration population size, 'product' mix (e.g., proportion of TANF, proportion of D-SNP, etc.), and existing medical expense magnitudes. The company is initially focused on markets where it can make a large impact across a sizeable population.

Firsthand has performed exceptionally well thus far in its initial market launches across the following dimensions:
*   **Engagement rate:** Firsthand has achieved 40-50% engagement rates across cohorts after 60 days (compared to benchmarks of 20-25% based on prior best practices in the market).⁸
    *   This success is due to 1) data-informed outreach (e.g., Firsthand will mine claims and other data to determine where members are), which enables them to identify individuals with the highest potential for engageability and establish contact with ~70% of those identified individuals and 2) peer relationships, where peers' lived experiences and trust-based relationship building means ~70% of contacted individuals continue to engage with peers after initial contact and ultimately enroll.
    *   This higher-than-expected engagement structure has led Firsthand to become more interested in moving beyond shared savings contracts into full capitation (though as previously mentioned, the team is thoughtful and prudent about time to operationalize).
*   **Clinical documentation:** Assumed 0.4 points of Hierarchical Condition Category (HCC) or Chronic Illness and Disability Payment System (CDPS) coding lift per member, but experience to date showing 0.7-0.8 points available
    *   Most of the excess is due to never-before-seen diagnoses for unmanaged and undiagnosed conditions (e.g., diabetes) resulting from years of unengagement. Firsthand's trust-based relationships enable the care team to uncover and address previously unaddressed care gaps - on average, three new care gaps are identified per member during multi-session whole person assessments.

We also had the opportunity to speak with Andy Kelly, VP of Provider Enablement for Optum Behavioral Health, who works directly with Firsthand. Optum has historically struggled to find and engage its highest cost SMI members, so they were really looking for a solution that could reach, engage, and facilitate referrals to Optum's provider network. The above metrics are even more impressive from this lens, considering that this subset represents members that Optum has not been able to engage in the past.

Furthermore, MCOs are under pressure from states to better serve the high-cost SMI population. Firsthand provides an innovative, community-based, and equitable solution for this.

## Future Growth
The company currently has an active payor sales pipeline of $7B+ in obtainable ARR (defined as ARR from PEMPY fees and shared savings, assuming 30% engagement at maturity) across 16 payors. Centene, UnitedHealthcare, and Elevance (fka Anthem) represent about 50% of the opportunity. With that said, the team is slow-rolling additional payer conversations, as their initial focus is building high ROI and operational excellence before going multi-payor. Though we think the pipeline conversations are exciting, we agree with management that the main short-term priority should not solely be geographic / payor expansion.

As mentioned above, management envisions contracts moving from fee-based to risk-based models around 18-24 months post-launch. Chief Actuary Kevin Francis has experience doing this from the payor side (as Chief Actuary of UnitedHealthcare's Medicaid businesses) and will build out a team of other leaders with risk-based P&L management experience to help build this out. Additionally, the company's risk roadmap includes developing low-touch programs to facilitate interventions for unengaged; deepening network partnerships; and investing in actuarial and population health modules, among other initiatives.

## Metrics / Financials
### Management P&L
As a reminder, this is Firsthand's first year of operations, and next year will be its first full year live. Even though there is only $0.8M in topline revenue this year, the underlying contracts with UnitedHealthcare for three states represent substantial greenfield. At 30% engagement of the current 55K attributed lives, that represents nearly $115M in annual revenue (PEMPM only, no shared savings). With in-state expansion of attributed lives, these three states alone can reach $275M by the end of our holding period.

A quick note on Management's revenue projections: Starting in FY2024, Firsthand's initial payer contracts transition from fee-based (PEMPM + shared savings) to risk-based. What this means is that Firsthand is paid $2,000 per member per month, which is a capitated payment that covers the members' medical expenses and is accounted for in the "Risk Revenue" line. However, this should be seen as a pass-through revenue stream that is paid out as members accrue medical expenses ('Baseline MedEx' in the P&L). If Firsthand is able to bring down medical expenses of lives that it has taken risk on (e.g., through better, more proactive management), Firsthand enjoys the savings ('Change in MedEx'). Therefore, when looking at Management P&L, the best revenue line to focus on is "Net Revenue / Medical Margin," as this does not include any pass-through elements.

The following key assumptions underpin management's model:
*   **Geographic Expansion:** Firsthand expands from Tennessee, Ohio, and Florida today into New York (March 2023), Louisiana (May 2023), Arizona (July 2023), Washington (September 2023), Texas (November 2023), and Rhode Island (January 2024).
    *   Firsthand assumes that new state and payor engagement curves follow Tennessee's engagement curve, with a premium or discount to adjust for relative market size
*   **Engagement Rate:** 40%. It's important to clarify the denominator for these engagement rates - from its pool of attributed members, Firsthand is using data & analytics to determine members who would be the most receptive to a peer-support model and for whom such engagement would most move the cost & outcomes needle. These leads are then 'batched' and assigned to peers each month.
*   **Care Pod Capacity:** Pods have a capacity of 270 engaged members, with each of the six peers having a carrying capacity of 45 engaged members.
*   **PEMPM Revenue Model:** $575 PEMPM + 50% shared savings
*   **Conversion to Risk:** Contracts convert to capitation risk models 18-24 months after initial launch. Once converted to risk, Firsthand assumes a stratification process that further refines the risk-based member pool from the attributed member pool based on geography, refined criterion, etc. (50% reduction assumed).
*   **Risk-Based Revenue Model:** $2,000 per risk-attributed member per month. Note that Firsthand cites this as 20% lower than the observed weighted average medical expense among its attributed members.
*   **Annual Attrition of Engaged Members:** 20%. Note that the company has not seen any churn of engaged members since June 2022 when it launched.
*   **Change in Member Revenue:** This refers to the value creation levers that Firsthand is able to realize (e.g., SSI/SSDI enrollment, D-SNP enrollment, clinical documentation, and medical expense savings). These accrue to the health plan initially, but once Firsthand starts to move into risk, they sit on Firsthand's P&L. The company has detailed assumptions around the magnitude of value creation based on each geography's 1) product mix (e.g., TANF vs. ABD vs. D-SNP); 2) enrollment success rate; and 3) potential incremental revenue based on historical spend amounts.
*   **MLR Guarantee:** 2% of risk revenue when Firsthand moves into risk-based contracts (pretty standard among these types of arrangements).
*   **Cost of Care:** In addition to the cost of care pod FTEs, Firsthand also includes leadership, vehicle, and field office costs into its cost of care expenses that are above the gross profit line.
*   **OpEx:** OpEx includes executive leadership, market development, payor operations, product & engineering, HR, legal, finance, etc. These teams are highly transferable and scalable across geographies and as Firsthand moves into new markets.

## GC Base Case
In our base case, we wanted to be more conservative on both topline growth and margin expansion. We believe we've been sufficiently conservative without being overly punitive on the model:
*   Launch in 7 states by 2024 instead of 9 (slows topline, as fewer care pods and engaged members)
*   30% engagement rate instead of 40% (slows topline, as takes care pods longer to reach full capacity)
*   Pod capacity of 240 vs. 270 (slows margin expansion, as each care pod has a higher cost structure)

Additionally, we have assumed that the model remains in PEMPM + shared savings contracts and does not shift to total cost of care risk in the future. We believe that this actually puts less friction on their path to scale given risk would bring up concerns around attribution (specifically around hesitation to move risk away from payers' clinical provider network).

## Implied Market Penetration
By 2030, we are assuming Firsthand engages ~2.1-2.9% of SMI lives in the seven states they are in (~3-4M total). This is conservative, as it takes SMI prevalence data from 2020 and also does not factor in underlying population growth. Even if we add in the ~70% of cohorts that Firsthand is not able to successfully enroll, 'outreached' members only make up ~7.1-9.8% of total SAM.

Arguably the growth limiter for Firsthand's expansion is on the provider side, so we looked at it from that angle as well. To hit implied numbers for engaged members and care pods in 2030, they need 2.2K peers and 372 NPs (which is only 0.4% of total licensed NPs in the states they are in). Both seem reasonable.

## Valuation & Returns Analysis
We model our returns based on the above GC assumptions and assume a base case exit based on 2030 gross profit of $217M and gross margins of 38% (representing a 7-year hold period). At the high end of our pre-money valuation of $150M, this implies a 2-3 year forward entry GP multiple of 9.9x (we have used 2024-2025 gross profit figures given the time to scale to positive gross profit in initial years).

At exit, we assume a 13.0x forward gross profit multiple, or $2.8B EV. This all equates to a 10.6x MOIC and 40% IRR. As shown below, this implies a 20.6x EBITDA multiple at exit, which is significantly below Signify's forward EBITDA multiple of ~28x implied from CVS' $8B acquisition earlier this year, albeit we believe that transaction was inflated. Even at a low-end 15x EBITDA multiple (shown below), we would still make a return on investment of 7.7x MOIC or 34% IRR.

Recall that our base case for this investment is a $25M investment from GC out of a $35M raise at $160M post, for ownership of ~15.6% of the business. This implies a 2-3 year forward entry GP multiple of 8.3x and at an exit gross profit multiple of 13.0x, this equates to 13.2x MOIC or 45% IRR.

Note that we are also assuming a 5% ESOP increase in the pre-money on top of their current ESOP pool of 2.5%.

If we assume a five-year hold period and exit on 2028 numbers, a $25M investment from GC out of a $35M raise at $160M post equates to 7.5x MOIC or 50% IRR (based on gross profit multiple of 13.0x).

## Public Comps
For exit, we looked at Agilon and Signify as public comps, as well as Aledade's Series E in June 2022 as a private comp, to arrive at our 13.0x exit GP multiple. As a reminder, Agilon and Aledade are both value based care enablement platforms that assists primary care practices in their shift to risk by providing wraparound services. Signify has a network of clinicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants who utilize home-based visits to conduct health risk assessments and understand clinical and social needs.

## Market Landscape
### GC Behavioral Health Portfolio
Our behavioral health portfolio today is robust, with a range of solutions that target specific behavioral health conditions across the acuity spectrum, an infrastructure layer in Osmind, and an adjacent bucket of primary care referral engines. While we have robust coverage on the moderate-to-severe end of the acuity spectrum (e.g. Elemy, Equip, Eleanor) we still do not have a solution primarily focused on SMI.

### Referral Engines
*   CITYBLOCK
*   homeward
*   transcarent
*   maribel HEALTH

### SMI Landscape (Acuity Spectrum)
*   **Mild:** sondermind®, Cartwheel, rippl
*   **SMI:** elemy, EQUIP, eleanor health, IOP
*   **Infrastructure Layer:** osmind

### SMI Landscape
Though there are many community mental health centers and non-profits that serve the SMI population, it is clear from today's outcomes that they are not able to engage and serve all individuals to the extent needed. Among start-ups tackling SMI, we have historically been hesitant to lean in to those who are condition-specific (e.g., NOCD, Charlie Health, Nema Health) and only tackling a subset of SMI diagnoses, not the broad spectrum.

There are two other companies in the SMI space who, like Firsthand, are tackling the full SMI spectrum - Amae Health and Vanna Health. Amae is building their own brick-and-mortar 'YMCA-like' clinics; this is a capital intensive model that brings clinical and social care in-house. Vanna Health is closer to Firsthand, but still employs its own providers and provides a high-level of clinical care in-house. We are most excited about Firsthand's model, where they do care navigation and coordination with oversight from a NP. As a result, Firsthand's model is more capital efficient than Vanna's and especially Amae's, but no less clinically rigorous. Again, our thesis in this space is that engagement is the bottleneck and that there are sufficient clinical resources in these communities to make a difference - the hard part is getting people opted into and engaged with basic care.

It is also important to note that we do not see this as a winner-takes-all market. As previously mentioned, there are over 14M adults in the U.S. with some form of SMI diagnosis, and that number will likely continue to grow as impactful interventions like Firsthand only scratch the surface.

## Responsible Innovation Considerations

| Magic quadrant      | X         | We believe that Firsthand can be a high impact, high performance company that is strongly aligned to multiple Responsible Innovation pillars. See below for additional detail.         |

*   **Advancing Inclusive Prosperity**
    *   Firsthand is building a solution for a segment of the population that has been traditionally left behind in their healthcare, personal, and social needs. The model and technology that Firsthand is championing directly impacts a population traditionally deemed 'unengageable.' Firsthand's wrap model touches not only these individual's healthcare needs, but also their social, vocational, and familial ones.
    *   **Championing Diversity**
        *   Firsthand's community-based model supports not only workforce development and expansion at the local level, but specifically provides employment and upskilling opportunities to individuals who may otherwise have difficulty finding and holding jobs given their past. Furthermore, the positive flywheel here is incredibly impactful, as vocational purpose has been shown to have both health-related and non health-related benefits to individuals.

## Key Risks
*   **Initial engagement levels will drop-off in the long run:** Firsthand has achieved incredibly impressive engagement levels in its initial cohorts, but the team does not have enough data to confidently assume these levels can be sustained. We have seen other models where initial engagement is strong, but drops off after teams make their way through the first wave of 'easier-to-engage' members.
    *   **Mitigant:** Both management's model and our model assume lower engagement than today's 50%+ (40% in management's, 30% in ours). We also believe that Firsthand's data-driven approach towards choosing and identifying members will help boost its engagement above the 20% that similar programs have typically seen. While not exactly apples to apples, Cityblock's overall engagement today is 43%, which is a clear example that sustained, elevated levels of engagement are possible even after 5 years in market.
*   **Difficult to scale today's high-touch model while maintaining strong team culture:** It's undeniable that Firsthand is a high-touch model; successfully engaged members on average had ~9.5 outreach attempts and touchpoints before enrolling, which underscores the difficulty of finding and engaging this population. Furthermore, the true growth limiter for most behavioral health companies is on the provider side. The company culture today is incredibly strong and mission-aligned, but Firsthand's ability to recruit, train, and retain peers, social workers, and nurse practitioners as it grows will be critical.
    *   **Mitigant:** Management actively understands that these are important focus areas. On scaling engagement, the team has started creating care plans for different 'profiles' of engaged individuals (e.g., 'significantly distrusting', 'ED super-user', etc.) that can then be personalized. On team and scaling culture, Firsthand intentionally brought in a Chief People Officer, Amy Forrester, very early on. In addition to over 10 years in people functions, Amy was interim Head of People at Cityblock so has experience working in similar organizations. Additionally, Firsthand's recent NPS survey (N=71 of 102) so far has 95% favorable engagement, which we think speaks to the strong culture that management has prioritized building since the beginning.
*   **Tech strategy does not drive expected operational efficiencies:** The team themselves admits that they have 'massively underinvested' in tech so far. Their current stack consists primarily of third-party solutions that drive operations and data analytics. So far, their product & engineering teams have not proven out the ability to ship product.
    *   **Mitigant:** Despite no proof points on tech yet, we are aligned with the team on their tech philosophy of 1) leveraging third-party builds where possible and 2) understanding their needs and where they can differentiate on tech before building. We also believe they have hired the right leads in Dhruv and Brennan to lead these efforts given their relevant backgrounds and experiences.
*   **Stage of business and unique model makes underwriting this deal complex:** Though we are impressed by Firsthand's initial successes, the company does not have robust proof points given how recent their market launches were. Furthermore, there is no true scaled or public comp for the playbook that Firsthand is trying to execute,
    *   **Mitigant:** The company has existing contracts that can scale dramatically. For our base case, we have stepped down both growth and margin expansion with assumptions that we believe are conservative but not overly punitive to the company. Further, we are not assuming the company becomes a full risk provider and so are not baking in the upside (and risk) associated with that.

## Double Down Criteria
We would consider doubling down in Firsthand at the Series C if the company:
*   Demonstrates consistent 35%+ engagement among its identified population
*   Proves their ability to optimize care pod capacity and efficiency, while minimizing (<5% yearly) churn among engaged members and care team members
*   Ships out internal tech modules (e.g., member stratification engine, SSI enablement workflow tools, etc.) that receive positive feedback by utilizing team members and demonstrate workflow efficiencies
*   Achieves at least $25M in gross profit

### firsthand: Member Engagement Story - Jonathan (DSNP)
**Jonathan**
*   37 y/o
*   African American
*   Male
*   Memphis
*   **Diagnoses:**
    *   schizophrenia, depression, diabetes, asthma, morbid obesity, HTN, atrial defibrillation, COPD

**Outreach & Discovery**
*   Jonathan was in one of the first batches of individuals we received from United
*   Firsthand guide (FG) met with his father the first time we went to his address, and he said Jonathan's mother makes all his decisions for him
*   The second time we went back to the house, two FGs went and met Jonathan's mother who spoke to us about his condition
*   Signed consent to enroll with firsthand on 7/19

**What We Learned**
*   Lives with his parents, has threatened to harm them when not taking his meds
*   On medication for bipolar but doesn't always remember to take it
*   Always going to hospital, even when not needed; refers to the hospital as the "spa"
*   Needs transportation to and from his mental health appointments, but his mom is more comfortable with FG driving him than other options given his mental state
*   Talks about his deceased brother like he is still alive
*   He can't use dosage of psychotropic meds he needs because it affects afib, so he's on a lower dose
*   He does not have social outlets or activities, which contributes to his spiraling mental health
*   Goals: getting him a phone so we can connect directly to him, find social outlets and a transportation solution, complete WPA

**Action Taken/Next Steps**
*   WPA initiated - we've scheduled an appointment to meet with our health guide several times only to discover he has ended up in crisis every time; finally met with our health guide a few weeks back
*   HG was able to prescribe psych medication to prevent hospital reentry after he had been off meds for two weeks
*   Took Jonathan to his psychiatrist appointment
*   Have provided a food box to Jonathan and his mom
*   **Next Steps**
    *   Want to talk to Jonathan more directly about his interests so he can participate in constructive activities that keep him occupied
    *   Continue with WPA - first conversation was a little all over the place given his condition, will need several subsequent sessions

## Appendix: Pod-Level Unit Economics & Confidence in 2023 Projections
Below shows a fully optimized pod based on management assumptions. The primary assumptions are 1) 40 new engaged members per month and 2) 300 engaged member pod capacity (which is higher than what management is projecting in its P&L).

Management estimates a fully optimized pod to reach capacity over ~ 9 months, which includes time for onboarding and training the care pod. As can be seen below, management also expects pods to breakeven cumulatively ~11 months after start.

| % Gross Margin           | 5.3%         | 39.8%        |

We can use this framework to establish confidence in our 2023 revenue projection of $10.7M. If we bring new adds per month down to 25 and pod capacity down to 240, each care pod does ~$850K revenue in its first year of operations. Management projects that they will have at least 10 pods up and running by the end of this year. Therefore, even assuming that all 10 existing pods starting from $0 at BOY 2023, these 10 pods alone would get ~80% of the way to that $10.7M projection.
