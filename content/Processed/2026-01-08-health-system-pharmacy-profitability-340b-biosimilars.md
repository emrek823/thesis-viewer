# The Startup Paradox: Health System Pharmacy Profits Are Real, But Vertical Integrators Are Winning

**The take:** There's a $66B+ annual arbitrage opportunity in health system pharmacy (340B spread + biosimilar margins + specialty drug economics), but the window for standalone software plays is closing fast. Vertical integrators—PBMs owning specialty pharmacies, wholesalers acquiring physician practices, health systems building in-house specialty pharmacies—are capturing these economics through ownership, not optimization software. The best startup opportunities are either (1) enabling health systems to vertically integrate faster, or (2) solving compliance/navigation problems that exist *because* of the complexity integrators create.

---

## How Health Systems Make Money on Drugs

### Mechanism 1: 340B Program Arbitrage

The 340B Drug Pricing Program is the single largest source of pharmacy profit for eligible hospitals.

**How it works:**
- Covered entities (safety-net hospitals, FQHCs, certain clinics) buy outpatient drugs at 25-50% below market price
- They dispense or have contract pharmacies dispense at full commercial reimbursement rates
- The "spread" between acquisition cost and reimbursement is pure margin

**Scale:**
- **$81.4 billion** in discounted purchases in 2024 (+23% YoY)
- **$66.4 billion** gross-to-net difference (funds available to covered entities)
- Hospitals account for **87%** of all 340B purchases
- 32,000 contract pharmacy locations (~60% of all US pharmacies)

**Per-hospital economics:**
- A 200-bed hospital can generate **$150,000-$200,000/month** in net profit from an in-house retail pharmacy with 340B
- A single specialty prescription can generate **$2,400+ margin** when acquired at 340B pricing and dispensed at commercial rates

### Mechanism 2: Biosimilar and Generic Spread

**Buy-and-bill model (physician-administered drugs):**
- Medicare reimburses at ASP + 6% (Average Sales Price plus a 6% margin)
- Providers acquire drugs below ASP through GPO contracts, wholesaler deals, or 340B
- The "spread" between acquisition and ASP reimbursement is profit
- The Inflation Reduction Act increased biosimilar add-on to **ASP + 8%** for 5 years to incentivize adoption

**The perverse 340B-biosimilar interaction:**
Research shows 340B eligibility is associated with a **22.9 percentage-point reduction** in biosimilar adoption. Why? Because the absolute dollar spread is larger on expensive branded biologics than on cheaper biosimilars. A hospital makes more money on a $10,000 branded drug at 40% discount than a $5,000 biosimilar at the same discount.

**Biosimilar adoption data:**
- Non-340B hospitals: 34.7% biosimilar use
- 340B hospitals: 11.8% biosimilar use
- This represents a **66% reduction** in biosimilar use attributable to 340B incentives

### Mechanism 3: Specialty Pharmacy Vertical Integration

**Health system-owned specialty pharmacy economics:**
- 26%+ of hospitals now own a specialty pharmacy (up from 8% in 2015)
- 9 in 10 large hospitals have in-house specialty pharmacy
- 70% of larger health system specialty pharmacies are the **exclusive pharmacy** for the system's self-insured employee health plan (steering)
- One-quarter of health system specialty pharmacies have **$100M+ annual revenue**

**Why they're building these:**
1. Capture 340B spread on specialty drugs internally (vs. sharing with contract pharmacies)
2. Avoid manufacturer 340B restrictions that limit contract pharmacy arrangements
3. Control prescribing decisions for highest-margin drugs
4. Force employee health plan utilization through network exclusivity

---

## How 340B Is Evolving: The Battleground

### Manufacturer Restrictions (The Existential Threat)

- **39 manufacturers** now impose distribution restrictions on 340B
- Hospitals collectively lose **~$3.2 billion annually** from these restrictions
- Restrictions include: requiring contract pharmacies to submit claims data, limiting to one contract pharmacy per covered entity, excluding specialty drugs entirely

### Regulatory and Legal Landscape

**Federal:**
- HRSA's **Rebate Model Pilot** (requiring upfront WAC payment with rebate later) was paused after industry pushback and AHA lawsuit
- D.C. Circuit and Third Circuit upheld manufacturers' rights to impose restrictions (statute is silent on distribution conditions)
- CMS surveying hospital acquisition costs—likely precursor to reducing 340B reimbursement rates

**State:**
- 22+ states considering or enacted laws prohibiting manufacturer 340B restrictions
- 8th Circuit validated Arkansas's law (Supreme Court declined to hear appeal)
- Patchwork of state laws creates compliance complexity

**Proposed Reform (SUSTAIN Act):**
1. Formalize contract pharmacy arrangements in statute
2. Establish centralized clearinghouse for Medicaid duplicate discount prevention
3. Introduce user fees on covered entities
4. Clarify eligible patient definition

### The Capital Stratification Effect

The shift from upfront discounts to rebate timing creates capital burden:
- Large health systems can float working capital
- Cash-strapped FQHCs struggle (original program switched FROM rebates TO upfront discounts specifically because "cash-strapped clinics lacked resources to float the funds")
- Result: Program benefits increasingly accrue to well-capitalized entities

---

## Is the 340B Cash Cow Coming to an End?

**Short answer: Not dead, but being systematically squeezed from five directions simultaneously.** The $66B gross-to-net pool will shrink, concentrate among fewer players, and become harder to capture. Hospitals depending on 340B for margin are facing a structural, not cyclical, challenge.

### Threat 1: Manufacturer Restrictions Are Already Crushing Savings

This is the clearest and present danger:

- **39 manufacturers** now restrict 340B pricing for contract pharmacy arrangements
- Eli Lilly started this in July 2020; it's now industry standard
- Hospitals lose an estimated **$3.2 billion annually** from restrictions
- **1 in 3 critical access hospitals** have cut services due to lost 340B savings
- **2 in 3 hospitals** with impacted drug assistance programs report patient harm

**Key manufacturers restricting:** AbbVie, Amgen, AstraZeneca, Eli Lilly, Johnson & Johnson, Novartis, Bristol Myers Squibb, Sanofi, and 30+ others.

**What they require:** Claims data submission through 340B ESP or similar platforms, limitation to one contract pharmacy per covered entity, or outright exclusion of specialty drugs.

**Court rulings favor manufacturers:** D.C. Circuit and Third Circuit both upheld manufacturers' rights to impose restrictions—the statute is silent on distribution conditions, so manufacturers have discretion.

### Threat 2: The Rebate Model Assault (Temporarily Paused)

Five major manufacturers (BMS, Eli Lilly, J&J, Novartis, Sanofi) proposed replacing upfront 340B discounts with post-sale rebates:

**How it would work:**
- Hospitals buy drugs at full WAC (Wholesale Acquisition Cost)
- Wait 10+ days for manufacturer to process rebate
- Must comply with manufacturer-specific reporting requirements
- Administrative burden shifts entirely to hospitals

**Why it's devastating:**
- 93% of hospitals surveyed said they couldn't maintain current uncompensated care levels
- 92% would reduce free/discounted drugs at their pharmacies
- 86% expect staffing cuts or layoffs
- Rural hospitals (400+ already at risk of closure) would be hit hardest

**Current status:** Federal judge blocked HRSA's rebate model pilot on December 29, 2025 (AHA lawsuit). Pilot paused for all covered entities. Manufacturers must continue offering upfront discounts—for now.

**The tell:** HRSA originally switched the program FROM rebates TO upfront discounts in the 1990s specifically because "cash-strapped clinics lacked resources to float the funds." Reverting to rebates is designed to squeeze out smaller players.

### Threat 3: CMS Is Coming for 340B

**The big shift:** Trump's FY2026 budget proposes moving 340B oversight from HRSA to CMS.

**Why hospitals are terrified:**
- HRSA has historically sided with hospitals in disputes with pharma
- CMS has a different track record:
  - In 2018, CMS cut Medicare reimbursement for 340B drugs by **nearly 30%** (later overturned by Supreme Court on administrative grounds, not merits)
  - CMS finalized rules limiting Medicaid reimbursement for 340B drugs to actual acquisition costs
  - CMS operates rebate-based programs (Medicaid, IRA)—may convert 340B to same model

**Drug Acquisition Cost Survey (Q1 2026):**
- CMS is surveying hospitals on acquisition costs for all separately payable Part B drugs
- Data will inform 2027 payment regulations
- This is the setup for cutting 340B drug reimbursement rates—if CMS knows your acquisition cost is 40% below ASP, why pay you ASP?

**The 340B "remedy" clawback:**
- CMS is reducing OPPS conversion factor by 0.5%/year to recoup $7.8B from the 2018-2022 period when 340B hospitals received elevated non-drug payments
- Originally scheduled through 2041; CMS proposed accelerating to 2% cuts (not finalized for 2026, but "will consider" for 2027)
- Estimated $275M reduction in 2026 alone

### Threat 4: The Inflation Reduction Act Will Deflate the Arbitrage

**Mechanism:** IRA's Maximum Fair Prices (MFPs) for negotiated drugs will compress the spread that makes 340B profitable.

**First 10 drugs (effective January 1, 2026):** Eliquis, Jardiance, Xarelto, Januvia, Farxiga, Entresto, Enbrel, Imbruvica, Stelara, Fiasp

**The non-duplication problem:**
- IRA prohibits manufacturers from providing BOTH 340B discount AND MFP on same claim
- Must offer whichever is lower (currently 340B is lower for ~85% of affected NDCs)
- But as list prices drop to align with MFP, the 340B ceiling price drops too
- The spread between acquisition and reimbursement compresses

**Drug Channels analysis:** "A pharmacy earning $30 on a drug with a $600 WAC would earn only $10 if WAC dropped to $200."

**Trajectory:**
- 10 drugs in 2026
- 15 additional drugs in 2027 and 2028
- 20 additional drugs in 2029 and beyond
- Each round of negotiations further compresses 340B economics

**Adam Fein's verdict:** "The Inflation Reduction Act will slow 340B growth in 2026."

### Threat 5: ACA/Medicaid Coverage Losses Create a Doom Loop

**The paradox:** 340B was designed to help safety-net hospitals serve uninsured/underinsured patients. But as coverage expands or contracts, 340B economics shift:

- As ACA and Medicaid coverage are reduced (current policy trajectory), hospitals see more uncompensated care
- That increases pressure on 340B to cross-subsidize those patients
- But 340B itself is under attack, reducing the subsidy available
- Result: Hospitals get squeezed from both sides

**Rural hospital data:**
- 48% of rural hospitals operated at a financial loss in 2023
- 196 rural hospitals closed between 2005-2024
- From 2017 to today: 62 closures, only 10 openings

### The Net Assessment: Structural Decline, Not Death

| Factor | Direction | Magnitude | Timing |
|--------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Manufacturer restrictions | Negative | -$3.2B/year already | Now |
| Rebate model proposals | Negative (paused) | Existential if implemented | Litigation ongoing |
| CMS oversight shift | Negative | Unknown but directionally bad | 2026-2027 |
| IRA list price compression | Negative | Growing each year | 2026+ |
| CMS acquisition cost survey | Negative | Potential payment cuts | 2027+ |
| OPPS "remedy" clawback | Negative | -$275M in 2026 | Through 2041 |
| State protection laws | Positive (partial offset) | 22+ states active | Varies |
| AHA litigation wins | Positive (temporary) | Buys time | 2025-2026 |

**Bottom line:** The $66B gross-to-net pool isn't disappearing overnight, but it's being eroded from multiple directions. The hospitals best positioned to survive:
1. Large, well-capitalized systems that can build owned specialty pharmacies
2. Systems that can navigate manufacturer restrictions and maintain compliance
3. Those who diversify revenue beyond 340B dependency

**Worst positioned:**
- Small/rural hospitals dependent on contract pharmacy revenue
- FQHCs without capital to float rebates if model changes
- Any covered entity that can't adapt to manufacturer-specific compliance requirements

### Implications for Startups

**If 340B is shrinking, why build here?**

1. **Complexity creates opportunity:** The regulatory chaos (39 manufacturer policies, 22+ state laws, federal litigation, CMS vs. HRSA) creates demand for navigation tools

2. **Consolidation favors enablers:** As only well-capitalized systems survive, they need infrastructure to build owned specialty pharmacies and capture remaining value

3. **The shift from contract to owned:** Health systems moving from contract pharmacy (under attack) to owned specialty pharmacy (defensible) need enablement

4. **Compliance-as-a-service:** As rules multiply, compliance burden increases—willingness to pay for audit defense and restriction navigation goes up

**What's NOT a good bet:**
- Pure 340B savings maximization (the pool is shrinking)
- Contract pharmacy optimization (that model is under structural attack)
- Assuming the current program structure persists

## Competitive Landscape: Where Are the Gaps?

### 340B Compliance/Management Software

**Dominant players:**
- **Sentry Data Systems (Craneware)**: Market leader, 40+ years audit experience, only vendor with fully integrated longitudinal audit record
- **Verity Solutions**: High customer satisfaction, strong account management
- **Apexus**: HRSA's 340B Prime Vendor, certification program (2,000+ certified experts)
- **MacroHelix, PharmaForce, RxStrategies**: Various segments with mixed satisfaction

**Key gap identified by KLAS:** "Across vendors, customers want more help **navigating drug manufacturer restrictions**"—indicating significant unmet need

### Pharmacy Purchasing Optimization

**Key player:**
- **Bluesight (formerly Kit Check)**: 2,400+ hospitals, CostCheck platform saved customers $100M+ through NDC optimization and GPO compliance
- Adoption of purchasing optimization software grew from 8% to 25% in one year

### Drug Discount Program Coordination

**Key player:**
- **Kalderos** ($35M raised, Bain Capital Ventures): Built Drug Discount Management platform, processed 1M+ claims for 4,200 covered entities, identified $640M in noncompliant discounts. Recently launched 340B Pay for real-time rebate processing.

### Biosimilar Optimization

**Your vault thesis notes:** Solstice Health built a biosimilar/ASP optimization tool; a major health system CRO was "ambivalent" because vertical integrators don't need software—they **own** the prescribing decision point.

---

## The Vertical Integration Reality

### Who's Actually Winning

**PBMs (pharmacy-side biosimilars):**
- Top 3 PBMs control 80% of prescriptions
- Each has private-label biosimilar (Cordavis/CVS, Quallent/Cigna, Nuvaila/UNH)
- "Nearly all marketed Humira biosimilars are excluded from 2025 formularies"—PBMs steering to their own products

**Wholesalers (buy-and-bill biosimilars):**
- Big 3 wholesalers (90% market share) spent **$16B+ on MSO acquisitions**
- McKesson acquired 70% of Core Ventures for $2.49B (December 2025)
- They capture **3-5x margins** by steering biosimilars through owned practices

**Contract pharmacy chains:**
- Top 5 companies (CVS, Walgreens, Walmart, Express Scripts, Optum) control **76%** of contract pharmacy market
- They earn ~$3 billion annually in gross profits from 340B
- PBM mail/specialty/infusion relationships quadrupled from 14K (2020) to 57K (2025)

**Health systems:**
- Building in-house specialty pharmacies to capture 340B spread internally
- Using self-insured employee health plans to steer utilization
- 98% of surveyed health system specialty pharmacies participate in 340B

### Why Software Loses to Ownership

From your vault thesis: "Vertical integrators don't need software—they OWN the prescribing decision point."

The economics: If you own the physician practice, you control which biosimilar gets prescribed. If you own the specialty pharmacy, you capture the 340B spread. Software that "optimizes" choices is fighting for crumbs when integrators have already captured the meal.

---

## Startup Opportunities: Where to Play

### Opportunity 1: Enable Health System Vertical Integration (HIGH CONVICTION)

**The thesis:** Health systems want to own their specialty pharmacy economics but lack capabilities to build/operate. Enable them to compete with CVS/Optum.

**What this looks like:**
- Specialty pharmacy-as-a-service for health systems (VytlOne/ProxsysRx model—they manage 22 in-house pharmacies, generate $750-1000/bed/month)
- Accreditation, compliance, and launch support for health system specialty pharmacies
- Technology platform + managed services hybrid

**Why it works:**
- Health systems are building these regardless (26%+ already have specialty pharmacy)
- Manufacturer restrictions push them to own pharmacies vs. contract
- Capital available (health systems are well-capitalized post-COVID)
- Recurring revenue from ongoing management

**Risks:**
- Service-heavy business model
- Competition from large consultancies (Huron, Vizient)
- Health system buying cycles are long

### Opportunity 2: Manufacturer Restriction Navigation (MEDIUM-HIGH CONVICTION)

**The thesis:** The #1 unmet need identified by KLAS is helping covered entities navigate drug manufacturer restrictions. This is a compliance and optimization problem that's getting more complex, not simpler.

**What this looks like:**
- Real-time tracking of 39+ manufacturer restriction policies
- Claims routing optimization to maximize 340B capture given restrictions
- Automated compliance with varying data submission requirements
- Contract pharmacy selection optimization based on restriction landscape

**Why it works:**
- Clear pain point (KLAS survey data)
- Complexity increasing (more manufacturers, state laws, new models)
- Recurring value prop (restrictions change constantly)
- Defensible if you build data asset on restriction policies

**Risks:**
- Incumbents (Sentry, Kalderos) may already be building this
- Policy could change (SUSTAIN Act might simplify)
- Lower TAM than core 340B compliance

### Opportunity 3: Biosimilar Adoption Infrastructure (LOWER CONVICTION)

**The thesis:** Biosimilar adoption is stalled (22% of market vs. ~80% in Europe for some products) due to financial incentives, PBM rebate walls, and P&T committee inertia. Someone could accelerate adoption.

**What this could look like:**
- P&T committee decision support with financial modeling
- Biosimilar conversion implementation services
- Prior authorization automation for biosimilars specifically
- Payer/PBM negotiation support for biosimilar access

**Why it's harder:**
- Vertical integrators have already captured the economics (they don't want faster adoption—they want THEIR biosimilar adopted)
- 340B hospitals are actively incentivized to NOT adopt biosimilars
- Administrative barriers (prior auth) are symptoms, not root cause
- PBM rebate walls are the real gatekeeper

**One angle that might work:** Helping non-340B physician practices (oncology, rheumatology) capture biosimilar spread. These practices are being acquired by McKesson/others precisely because the economics are attractive.

### Opportunity 4: 340B-Adjacent Compliance (MEDIUM CONVICTION)

**The thesis:** The regulatory complexity around 340B creates compliance opportunities beyond the core program.

**Examples:**
- Medicaid duplicate discount prevention (the SUSTAIN Act envisions a centralized clearinghouse—someone could build it)
- State-by-state compliance with new 340B protection laws
- Audit readiness and defense services (HRSA intensifying audits)
- Contract pharmacy arrangement optimization given restrictions

**Why it might work:**
- Compliance is a cost center—health systems will pay to avoid penalties
- Regulatory complexity is increasing, not decreasing
- Audit defense is high-stakes, high-willingness-to-pay

### Opportunity 5: Pharmacy Purchasing Optimization (MEDIUM CONVICTION)

**The thesis:** 77% of pharmacy teams are focused on reducing drug spending. Only 25% have adopted purchasing optimization software. Room to grow.

**What this looks like:**
- NDC-level alternative recommendations (Bluesight model)
- GPO compliance monitoring and rebate optimization
- Drug shortage prediction and mitigation (Bluesight's ShortageCheck claims 90 days advance notice)
- Multi-wholesaler pricing optimization

**Why it's interesting:**
- Clear ROI ($15,000 average savings per NDC recommendation)
- Adoption growing fast (8% → 25% in one year)
- Works for all hospitals, not just 340B

**Why it's harder:**
- Bluesight is well-funded and has 2,400 hospitals
- Margins are thin (optimizing a few percent of drug spend)
- Wholesaler/GPO relationships are sticky

---

## Contradictions & Open Questions

### Unresolved Tensions

1. **The biosimilar paradox:** Policy wants biosimilar adoption, but 340B incentivizes branded drugs. IRA's 8% add-on helps but doesn't fully offset. MedPAC proposes consolidated billing codes—would change the math entirely.

2. **340B reform uncertainty:** SUSTAIN Act could formalize contract pharmacy rights (good for hospitals) OR impose user fees and restrictions (bad for hospitals). Direction unclear.

3. **State vs. federal preemption:** State laws protecting 340B contract pharmacy access are being litigated. If federal preemption wins, manufacturer restrictions stand; if states win, restrictions unravel.

### Questions for Founder Conversation

1. **Where in the stack?** Is this 340B-specific (existing players, defined market) or broader pharmacy optimization (bigger TAM, more competition)?

2. **340B or non-340B?** 340B hospitals have the biggest arbitrage but are hardest to change behavior (they're making money on current behavior). Non-340B hospitals have less margin but more willingness to optimize.

3. **Software or services?** Your vault thesis suggests pure software loses to ownership. Does founder have operational chops to build services wrapper?

4. **Expansion path?** "Find most profitable biosimilars" is a feature; what's the product? Specialty pharmacy management? Purchasing optimization? Compliance platform?

5. **Buyer persona?** 340B program directors (Mount Sinai interview suggests they're overwhelmed), pharmacy directors, CFOs, or system-level supply chain?

---

## Recommendations

1. **Probe the model:** Pure SaaS for pharmacy optimization is crowded (Bluesight, Sentry, Kalderos). The more interesting plays involve services or infrastructure that enables health system vertical integration.

2. **Ask about manufacturer restrictions:** If founder has unique insight into navigating restrictions, that's the #1 gap in the market per KLAS data.

3. **Validate non-340B angle:** The 340B world is Byzantine and captured by integrators. Non-340B hospitals and physician practices might be more attractive buyers with cleaner economics.

4. **Watch the policy:** SUSTAIN Act, CMS acquisition cost survey, and state laws could dramatically reshape 340B economics in 12-24 months. Thesis needs to be robust to regulatory change.

**Bull case:** Health systems desperately need to capture specialty drug economics to survive; they lack capabilities; founder builds the managed services + tech platform that becomes the infrastructure for health system specialty pharmacy.

**Bear case:** Vertical integrators (CVS, Optum, McKesson) have already won the specialty drug economics game; any remaining value is picked up by incumbents (Sentry, Kalderos); regulatory reform shrinks the 340B arbitrage pool.

## Company Comparison: Tandem vs Latent vs Mandolin

Based on expert interviews, pitch decks, and DD materials.

### Overview Table

| Company | Business Model | Customer | Focus | Traction | Funding | Virtue Fit |
|---------|---------------|----------|-------|----------|---------|------------|
| **Tandem** | Pharma-funded PA automation | Providers (neurologists, dermatologists) | Branded drugs, Part D | 1,035 providers signed, 1,131 pipeline | $7M seed (Thrive, $35M cap), raising $20-30M | TOO LATE |
| **Latent Health** | Health system PA automation | Health systems (specialty pharmacy) | Specialty pharmacy, Part D | 25+ health systems (Yale, Ochsner, Northwestern, Mt. Sinai) | $50M Series B (GC, YC) | TOO LATE |
| **Mandolin** | Infusion PA automation | Infusion centers, pharmacies | Infusion, Part B | 700+ clinics, 250K patients; NO health systems | $57M total ($40M Series A, Greylock) | TOO LATE |

### Tandem: Pharma-Funded, Provider-Side

**What they do:** AI-powered PA automation for branded specialty drugs, distributed through the EHR (providers "prescribe to tandem" like a pharmacy). Pharma manufacturers pay for improved patient access.

**Key economics:**
- $600B+ annual branded Rx spend
- 37% of Rx abandoned due to PA delays/denials
- 14 hours/week per provider spent on PA process
- $250B+ lost revenue for pharma from non-adherence

**Business model:**
- Free for providers (EHR integration, no IT lift)
- Pharma pays $38K-$96K per physician for 10x ROI on brand Rx lift
- Target TAMs: $9B (retail routing), $10B (specialty admin), $30B+ (PBM/Plans)

**Current state (from DD log):**
- 1,035 providers signed representing ~$5M run rate at 1 pharma contract
- 1,131 more providers in pipeline
- Target: 3,500 providers, ~1M scripts, $10M+ run rate by E2025
- Unit costs: $15/script today → $2/script at scale (85% gross margin target)
- Pharma conversations: Sanofi (CCO-level), AbbVie, UCB, BMS, Pfizer, Lilly

**Target specialties:** Neurology (migraines), Dermatology (psoriasis), GI (Crohn's), Rheumatology, Pulmonology—high-cost branded drugs with manufacturer competition.

**Why it's different:** Provider-side, pharma-funded—doesn't compete with Latent/Mandolin. Different customer (providers), different payer (pharma), lower switching costs.

### Latent Health: Health System Specialty Pharmacy

**What they do:** Medical language models for specialty pharmacy PA automation. Searches EHRs, surfaces clinical evidence, generates PA submissions, automates appeals.

**Key economics (from Northwestern interview):**
- Specialty pharmacy at Northwestern "generates second most revenue outside of oncology"
- 50% reduction in PA completion time
- 97% clinical QA accuracy
- One-day implementation capability
- Planning to phase out CoverMyMeds for Latent

**Pricing (from Cone Health CPO):**
- ~$400K/year for mid-size health system
- 4x ROI target (Latent's model)
- Year 1: $1M net impact off $400K spend
- Year 5: $3-3.6M impact

**Customer dynamics:**
- "Would need an act of God" to switch once implemented—extreme lock-in
- IT bandwidth and AI governance boards create 1+ year implementation cycles
- CPOs fought to bring Latent in; won't go through that again for competitor

**Competitive position:**
- Only ~12 health system partners showing (Yale, Ochsner, Northwestern, Mt. Sinai)
- Market is "wide open"—most health systems haven't adopted AI PA solutions yet
- Epic is building competing LLM solutions ("the elephant in the room")

### Mandolin: Infusion-Focused (Part B)

**What they do:** AI agents for infusion centers—prior auth, benefits verification, document processing for physician-administered drugs (Part B, not Part D).

**Why CPO chose Latent over Mandolin (critical insight):**

> "Mandolin's product was really focused in the infusion space. Part B benefit, where specialty is all out Part D. **Where we knew the money was specialty.** When our IT teams like, 'We can only get one of these done in the next year, which one do you want?' It was we're obviously going to go at Latent because **that's where the revenues are.**"

**The specialty vs. infusion math:**
- Specialty pharmacy revenue is **2-3x** infusion revenue (non-oncology)
- Oncology infusion and specialty are roughly 1:1
- Non-oncology infusion (Tysabri, Ocrevus) is "fractional" compared to specialty

**Mandolin's structural problem:**
- Infusion is decentralized—each location has own staff doing PA
- Staff often don't report to pharmacy (nurse managers, clinic ops)
- Harder to show ROI because you're not reducing YOUR FTEs
- Health systems haven't centralized infusion prior auth yet
- Mandolin has 700+ clinics but **no health systems**—still in for-profit infusion space

## What Startup Opportunities Make Sense (And Which Don't)

### Expert CPO's Recommended Entry Point

From Cone Health CPO interview—where to start if building from scratch:

> "If I were a brand-new entrant into it, I would really be focusing on the **optimization, especially pharmacy. That's a little bit more on the front end.** What are your gaps in? Do you have leakage that's coming out? What are your other financial opportunities? **That really sets up the narrative for investment.**"

**Translation:** Don't start with PA automation. Start with analytics that show the opportunity, then layer on PA automation.

> "If you equip a chief pharmacy officer to be able to walk into the C-suite and just say, 'My specialty pharmacy is worth $50 million annually and I'm only capturing $20 million of it because of these issues,' they're going to love you."

**Willingness to pay for analytics alone:** $400K-$500K/year

### OPPORTUNITIES THAT MAKE SENSE

#### 1. Specialty Pharmacy Analytics/Leakage Identification (HIGHEST CONVICTION)

**What it is:** Real-time dashboard showing health systems their specialty pharmacy opportunity—what's leaking to external pharmacies, which physicians aren't capturing scripts, margin opportunity by drug/payer/clinic.

**Why it works:**
- No one does this well today ("very manual," "not something you can easily get from Epic")
- CPO would pay $400-500K just for this
- Creates the business case for all other investments (PA automation, FTE reduction)
- Lower IT lift than PA automation (analytics vs. workflow)
- Sets you up to cross-sell PA automation later

**Why no one's built it:**
- Requires deep Epic/Willow integration
- Different health systems configured differently
- Data normalization is hard
- Not as sexy as "AI PA automation"

**What it would need:**
- Live data feed from EMR/EHR
- Break down by hospital, clinic, specialty, physician, drug, payer
- Show margin opportunity on captured vs. lost scripts
- Track trends over time

#### 2. Provider-Side PA Automation (Tandem Model, but Different Wedge)

**What it is:** Pharma-funded PA automation distributed to prescribers, not health systems.

**Why it could work for a new entrant:**
- Different GTM than Latent (providers, not health systems)
- Different payer (pharma, not health systems)
- Lower switching costs (prescribers don't have 1-year IT implementations)
- Tandem proved the model works

**What would need to be different:**
- Tandem has the lead in neuro/derm—need different specialty wedge
- Could focus on: oncology (highest stakes), cardiology, endocrinology
- Or go after smaller physician groups Tandem isn't targeting

**Risk:** Tandem has $7M raised and is raising $20-30M more. First-mover advantage in pharma relationships.

#### 3. Specialty Pharmacy Build/Operate Services (NOT Software)

**What it is:** Help health systems build and operate owned specialty pharmacies—accreditation, compliance, launch, ongoing management.

**Why it works:**
- Health systems are building these regardless (26%+ already have)
- Manufacturer restrictions push them to owned vs. contract
- Software loses to ownership; services enable ownership
- VytlOne/ProxsysRx model validates ($750-1000/bed/month)

**Risk:** Service-heavy, harder to scale, competes with consulting firms.

### OPPORTUNITIES THAT DO NOT MAKE SENSE

#### 1. Infusion-Only PA Automation (Competing with Mandolin)

**Why not:**
- Specialty pharmacy is 2-3x the money
- Infusion is fragmented across departments (harder to sell)
- Mandolin has $57M raised and still hasn't cracked health systems
- CPO explicitly deprioritized infusion: "we're obviously going to go at Latent because that's where the revenues are"
- Would need to solve organizational consolidation problem first (who owns infusion?)

**The CPO's experience:** "Infusion wasn't centralized for the prior authorization and patient assistance portion of it. It was every single infusion location we had, which was 13 of them. The staff there were not all pharmacy staff. Frankly, they didn't all give a shit either."

#### 2. Pure PA Automation for Health Systems (Competing with Latent)

**Why not:**
- Latent has first-mover advantage with key lighthouse accounts (Yale, Ochsner, Mt. Sinai)
- $50M raised, General Catalyst backing
- 1+ year implementation cycles create extreme lock-in
- "Would need an act of God to switch" once implemented
- Epic is building competing solutions—major platform risk
- Market may be "wide open" but CPOs won't go through the fight twice

**What would need to be true:**
- Dramatically better product (unlikely given Latent's head start)
- Dramatically different approach (e.g., analytics-first, then PA)
- Target health systems Latent can't serve (smaller? different EHR?)

#### 3. Pure 340B Savings Maximization

**Why not:**
- The 340B pool is shrinking (manufacturer restrictions, IRA compression, CMS oversight shift)
- Vertical integrators are capturing remaining value through ownership
- Software loses to ownership (your vault thesis)
- Incumbents (Sentry, Kalderos) own the compliance layer
- Contract pharmacy model under structural attack

**One exception:** Manufacturer restriction navigation is the #1 unmet need per KLAS. If someone built the "restriction intelligence" layer, that could work—but it's a feature, not a company.

#### 4. Biosimilar Adoption Software

**Why not:**
- 340B hospitals are **incentivized NOT to adopt biosimilars** (larger spread on branded)
- PBM rebate walls are the real gatekeeper—software can't fix this
- Vertical integrators have already captured the economics
- ASP+8% biosimilar add-on helps but doesn't change fundamental incentives

## Updated Recommendations for Founder Conversation

### Key Questions to Ask

1. **Which layer are you playing?** Analytics vs. PA automation vs. services?

2. **Who's the customer?** Health systems (Latent's space), providers (Tandem's space), or someone else?

3. **Who pays?** Health system (need ROI), pharma (need brand lift), payers (need utilization management)?

4. **What's the wedge?** The CPO said start with analytics/leakage identification—is founder starting there or jumping to PA automation?

5. **How do you avoid the Latent/Mandolin trap?** Once someone's in, switching costs are extreme. What creates lock-in for you?

6. **What's the Epic strategy?** Epic is building competing LLM solutions. Are you a complement or a competitor?

### Bottom Line Assessment

**Best opportunity for a new entrant:** Front-end specialty pharmacy analytics that shows health systems their opportunity. $400-500K willingness to pay. Creates the business case for everything else. Then layer on PA automation once you have the account relationship.

**Worst opportunity for a new entrant:** Head-to-head competition with Latent (PA automation for health system specialty pharmacy) or Mandolin (infusion PA). Both have capital, customers, and the switching costs make displacement nearly impossible.

**The insight no one's talking about:** The CPO said what matters is "can you equip me to walk into the C-suite and say we have a $50M opportunity and we're only capturing $20M?" That's analytics, not PA automation. And no one's built it well.
