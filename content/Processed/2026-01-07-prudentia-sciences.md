Today is a milestone for Prudentia Sciences. We’ve raised **$20M in Series A funding**, led by McKesson Ventures with participation from SignalFire. Our early backers included Iaso Ventures, Virtue, and GV. I’m grateful for their trust, and for every conversation, customer engagement, and piece of feedback that brought us here.

But this raise is not the point. It’s proof that we’re onto something real, a problem worth solving and a path forward that resonates with people doing the work every day.

### **The Problem We See**

Life sciences is one of the most important industries on the planet, deploying hundreds of billions every year toward discovering and developing breakthrough therapies. Yet the way we evaluate, structure, and transact on innovation hasn’t kept pace with the scale of opportunity or risk.

Biopharma and investors commit more than $250B annually to dealmaking, yet fragmented diligence workflows and siloed decision-making have left over $1T in capital sitting on the sidelines. At the same time, patent cliffs are forcing companies to rethink how they source innovation, while AI-accelerated drug discovery is dramatically increasing the number of early-stage assets competing for attention. The burden of diligence has never been higher.

And the cost of this inefficiency is not abstract. Promising drugs stall or die not because the science fails, but because decisions take too long, signals are missed, or risk cannot be assessed with confidence. When that happens, patients wait longer for therapies that could change or save their lives. Some never get them at all.

### **Our Vision**

At Prudentia, we believe the future of biopharma dealmaking and diligence should be fast, rigorous, and deeply human-centered. Patients deserve better. They deserve an industry where scientific progress translates into therapies reaching the people who need them, faster and more reliably.

Search did not just make information faster, it made knowledge accessible. Cloud infrastructure did not just make computing cheaper, it made scale possible. Payments platforms did not just move money, they enabled entire new markets to exist. Our goal is to do the same for life sciences dealmaking. To put rigorous, expert-driven diligence at people’s fingertips without sacrificing depth, judgment, or accountability.

That means building systems grounded not just in data, but in deep scientific expertise. At the core of our platform is the judgment of people who have successfully brought multiple drugs to market, the patterns, instincts, and decision frameworks that rarely live in software but shape the best outcomes.

To build these systems, we’ve brought together world-class engineers, drug development experts, and dealmakers from some of the most respected organizations in technology, science, medicine, and finance. This combination is deliberate. Technology alone doesn’t solve hard problems, and expertise alone doesn’t scale. Prudentia exists at the intersection of both.

We aren't a tool for high-volume scouting; we are the high-magnification lens for the $2B bets where our industry cannot afford to be wrong.

Our software synthesizes complex clinical and scientific signals, orchestrates expert input through human-in-the-loop workflows, and turns fragmented diligence into coherent, decision-ready insight. The goal is simple, better decisions made faster with greater confidence.

### **Creating Collective Value Across the Ecosystem**

Life sciences dealmaking is not a single-player activity. It is an ecosystem that includes biopharma, emerging biotechs, investors, bankers, and KOLs all working with different incentives but shared dependencies.

Our goal is to enable collective value creation across this ecosystem. Biopharma teams move faster with greater confidence. Biotechs spend less time repeatedly re-explaining their science and more time advancing programs. Bankers gain clearer insight into risk and opportunity. Advisors and experts can contribute more effectively and consistently.

By creating a shared system of record for diligence, Prudentia helps align incentives and reduce friction across stakeholders. Each participant benefits individually, but the real leverage comes from the network effect. As more participants operate within the same system, the quality, speed, and reliability of decision-making improves for everyone.

This is how durable infrastructure gets built. Not by optimizing for a single workflow, but by enabling the ecosystem to work better together.

### **Where We Are And What’s Next**

With this funding, we’re scaling our product capabilities, deepening our intelligence across scientific and commercial diligence, and expanding beyond the U.S. into Asia-Pacific and Europe to support global partners navigating increasingly complex pipelines.

### **The Work Ahead**

We’re still early.

Human health is complex by nature, and no system should pretend otherwise. But we believe that by pairing deep domain expertise with thoughtfully designed technology, we can materially improve how the world invests in and delivers new medicines.

None of this is possible without the team at Prudentia and the customers who trusted us early. I’m grateful to every partner who has helped shape what we’re building and to those who will help us build what comes next.

There’s much more to do.
