who have walked more than a mile in our shoes. 32Health understands, and has lived through, the painstaking
process of credentialing and recredentialing through their shared experiences. They combined that history with
incredibly nimble technical expertise and created just the tool we needed to push the EASY button for us in the
credentialing area. We have been able to free up our people to do what humans do best in provider relations—foster
relationships with our dental offices. We are saving time, money, labor and have improved employee satisfaction with
