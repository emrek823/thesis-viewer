### Company Overview & Business Model

- InSite Health - started company 3 years ago with K-12 go-to-market in pediatric space
- Previous business in K-12 focused on return to school market during COVID
	- Bootstrapped to couple hundred thousand patients in 29 states
- Current metrics: $7.5M run-rate, 55% gross margins, doubling in size each year for 3 years
- Revenue breakdown:
	- $2.5M SaaS revenue for platform
	- $2M insurance-based revenue (seeing kids outside school)
	- Remainder from bundled staffing revenue (on-site therapists, psychiatrists)

### Go-to-Market Strategy & Differentiation

- Problem: School districts contract 10-15 different vendors for behavioral health programs
	- Very small portion is software/telehealth only (peers like Cartwheel)
	- Rest are ABAs, speech therapists, social workers, etc.
- Solution: Bridge all gaps with one ecosystem approach
	- Focus on behaviorally complex students on mental health side
	- Bundle everything schools need: screening, care navigation, on-site therapy, psychiatric evaluations, wellness curriculum
- Sales cycle: Months instead of weeks
	- Peak conversations January-March for next school year
	- District-level contracts rather than school-level
- Market penetration: Only 10% of New Jersey currently, significant room for growth

### Funding & Growth Plans

- Raising $5M late seed round (have term sheet from last week)
	- Challenge: Current offer wants entire round and to fund through lifecycle
	- Exploring other leads and follow-on investors
- Use of funds: Scale to $15M run-rate and expand to third state
- Vision: Become national leader in wellness for schools
	- “PowerSchool built for student information systems, McGraw Hill for curriculum - someone needs to be national leader for wellness”
	- Target 10-15 states with deep regional penetration
- AI perspective: Currently table stakes for efficiency (documentation, scheduling, care navigation)
	- Does not see AI as significant margin enhancer - business will remain 50-60% gross margin
	- Nominal margin enhancer but incredibly important to remain competitive
