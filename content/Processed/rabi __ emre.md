### Company Overview & Problem

- Counter is a pharmacy benefit navigation platform focused on improving member experience and cost savings
- Pharmacy is most common healthcare journey (13 pharmacist visits vs 7 provider visits annually)
- 30% of pharmacy spend due to improper member decisions
- $586B US net pharmacy spend with 25-35% potential savings pool (~$188B opportunity)
- Pharmacy trend growing 5x inflation vs non-pharmacy medical trend at 3x

### Product Evolution & Strategy

- Pivoted in late 2023 from hybrid fintech/navigation platform to focus solely on navigation
- Focus areas:
	- International sourcing
	- Clinical alternatives
	- Driving hard dollar ROI for plan sponsors
- Platform analyzes claims data, rebate guarantees, formularies, and MAC lists
- Ensures “win-win-win” for client, PBM, and plan sponsor
- Works within PBM workflow and formulary structure

### Traction & Growth

- 31 employers live on Counter (up from 25)
- $760k committed revenue
- Recently closed large municipality (Polk County, Florida)
- $4.5M in open pipeline from existing distribution partners
- $2.5M recurring savings across book of business
- Key partnerships:
	- ProAct (PBM partner)
	- Rx Connection (pharmacy benefit consultant)
	- Innovative Rx (serves ~1M lives)

### Distribution Strategy

- Working through PBM partners (ProAct, Rx Connection)
- Success case: American Cast Iron Company through Rx Connection led to broader ProAct partnership
- Enterprise agreement with ProAct live mid-last year
- Building case studies with municipalities (e.g., Wayne Township Metropolitan School District)
- Strategy: Get first group through PBM, build case study, expand relationship
