Mural Health 3.21.23

Sales activity / pipeline updates

Capabilities

Travel / hotels - if we had this, it would be more fruitful

Pay folks in China - interesting feature to add. Working on that

Partnerships

Proofpilot

Clinical Ink

Advarra

Was supposed to give us M&A offer so pivoting more towards partnership agreement

LedgerRun

Most profitable - they need us, we need them

5-10M in revenue

Differences in channel vs. direct to sponsor

Depending on how we structure

SSO to hop b/t platforms, but then once we white label

Pipeline / sales activity

Taking time - bit of a slog. Only question in my mind

Things seem to be going well - if all those things turn into real $ by Q3/Q4

The pipeline doesn’t convert -

Competitors

Lost to Generic pre-paid cards b/c all they cared about was prie

If we talk to a buyer that only cares about cost of payment

GP

Scout comes up some time - Moderna/Paraxel mentioned them

IQVIA conversations

So amped to figure out how to get us on studies. They know that we are early and is atypical but they are so amped by economic oppotyunty.

Things like that is how i counterbalance fear/anxiety of not converting pipeline

Medidata - outbound reached out to Mural

Paraxel - CIO / corp dev team

PPD - reached out through GA
