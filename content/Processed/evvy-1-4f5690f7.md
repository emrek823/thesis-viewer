Vaginal microbiome as a predictor for outcome of in vitro fertilization with or without intracytoplasmic sperm injection: a prospective study | Human Reproduction | Oxford Academic

Koedooder performed a prospective study of reproductive-age women undergoing IVF and found that embryo implantation was less successful in women with reduced Lactobacillus spp. in their vaginal microbiota. The authors proposed an algorithm, utilising the IS-pro sequencing method, to predict the IVF success rate based on the vaginal microbiota composition. They identified women with a low chance of becoming pregnant due to reduced Lactobacillus in the vaginal microbiota (18% of the dataset of 192 women). The model was 94% accurate (with high specificity [97%], but low sensitivity [26%]): 32 out of 34 women with an unfavourable profile did not achieve pregnancy. An external validation cohort study further supported the prediction specificity. According to high versus low Lactobacillus dominance the women were divided into two subgroups with favourable and unfavourable prediction, respectively. None of the women in the unfavourable group became pregnant

Characterization of the Vaginal Microbiome in Women with Infertility and Its Potential Correlation with Hormone Stimulation during In Vitro Fertilization Surgery

Infertile women show characteristic variations in vaginal microbiome, such as increased abundance of Atopobium, Aerococcus, and Bifidobacterium and decreased abundance of Lactobacillus and Leuconosto
