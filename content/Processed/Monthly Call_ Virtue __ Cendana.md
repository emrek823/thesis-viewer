	- Sequoia reached out with interest, talking today
- Zoclo: Series A signed December 27-28
	- $70M post-money, up to $15M round size (likely closer to $12M)
	- EO Ventures (Equal Opportunity Ventures) leading
- Integral: Insider round after external funding delayed
	- $100M post-money, $8-10M round size
	- AI revenue too new for external investors (need 180+ days track record)

- Anna: Term sheet expired with TCAP
	- Originally $15-17M round at $75M post-money
	- Currently at $6.08M ARR as of October 2025
	- 4+ years runway, back to original plan of Series A in 6-9 months

### TCAP Partnership Issues

- Multiple problematic incidents over 12 months:
- Anna-specific problems:
	- Attempted to retrade key terms after signing
	- Tried to insert blanket sell right blocking Virtue influence
	- Disrespectful to founder and Virtue team
- TCAP is $250K LP in Fund 1
	- Considering buying them out
	- Will exclude from future LP updates
	- GPS call scheduled tomorrow to discuss

### Portfolio Construction Strategy Discussion

- Current approach: 80%+ of Fund 2 deals either led or co-led
	- Last two deals were only money in (prompted financings)
	- Considering larger initial checks (2-3M vs 750K-1.5M) for higher ownership (15% vs 10%)
- Cendana feedback: Recommend more diversification
	- Market graduation rates declining
	- Hyper-concentrated strategies haven’t performed well
	- 7.5% ownership in $55M fund can still be impactful for outliers
	- Don’t over-extrapolate from limited quarters of data
- Virtue maintaining 4-year investment period approach
	- High quantity but lower quality deal flow currently
	- Will remain patient for right opportunities

### Next Steps

- Sean: Reach out to Hillary with JPM Healthcare Conference schedule
- Sean: Provide formal Anna revenue update to Cendana
- Sean: TCAP GPS call tomorrow
- Cendana: Coordinate office access for Sean and team during JPM week
