## Executive Summary
32Health is building an AI/NLP-enabled back-end claims infrastructure for the $140B US dental insurance market by providing claims auto-adjudication, smart underwriting, and plan benefit design. Dental insurance today runs on an archaic infrastructure with manual data processing resulting in a high cost of administration and claims that is decades behind health insurance despite sharing many of the same regulatory and administrative requirements. National enrollment in dental plans has increased from 66% to 80% over the last 5 years and regulatory changes to dental-loss-ratios (DLRs) are pushing plans in a historically commoditized industry to cut costs and innovate in an increasingly competitive commercial and government market. Per diligence conversations with target clients, 32Health is expected to reduce expense ratios for plans by up to 80-90%, which allows plans to be more competitive with lower premiums while also drastically increasing operating margin. Plans across the industry are actively looking for solutions to replace their homegrown internal legacy software, often developed 20-30 years ago using antiquated programming languages, but have spent years disappointed with current options in market.

Shaju Puthussery, a dental technology C-suite leader with 20+ years of experience, and Deepak Ramaswamy, the founding CTO that built OverJet's industry leading AI platform, were the driving force behind the success of OverJet, the leading venture-backed AI dental company on track to reach $10M in ARR this year only four years after founding. Shaju and Deepak left to build 32Health to transform the entire dental claims market, rather than the narrow 10% of the dental claims industry that OverJet is tackling. Industry references confirm they are one of the few (if not only) people in dental with the market understanding and technical proficiency to build this specific business. They can leverage their deep industry connections and software platform built on a modern data stack to scale rapidly in a virtually un-penetrated market.

After building for only a few months, the company has an impending SOW (Virtue spoke with this client - pricing and key terms have been agreed to and now pending CEO signature) with an insurance plan for $900K in ARR (~$4.50 per member per month) with a potential expansion opportunity to $2.5M ARR. The founding team's relationships with dental plans and market timing give them unique distribution advantages to reduce long enterprise sales cycles and drive adoption of an extremely sticky, high gross-margin (~70%) software platform. Over the next 12-18 months, 32Health can reach >$1M in ARR with its best-in-class initial product, invest in product development to maintain a durable competitive advantage, and build a customer pipeline and repeatable sales motion to prepare for scale. In conversations with potential customers and our internal analysis, the company's market timing, GTM, and product development strategy gives them the opportunity to reach ~5M members over the next 4-5 years, resulting in $80M - $100M in ARR. We are excited to back a unique team building a capital-efficient, high-gross margin business in a large, growing, and historically ignored market.

Virtue is leading a $3M SAFE at $19M post-money cap, with $900K from Virtue's core fund (4.7% ownership) and $600K in an SPV from Nomi Health (15% Carry, effective ownership of 2.37%). This effectively brings Virtue's total investment to $1.35M, 7.11% weighted ownership after the financing.

In numerous on-sheet and off-sheet references, we consistently heard that Shaju and Deepak were one of the only teams (if not the only team) in market capable of building this company. They are dental tech market historians in the truest sense of the word. Shaju was the CEO at P&R Dental Strategies, one of the leading claims review and data analytics providers for dental insurance plans. He then went on to become the Chief Analytics officer at DentaQuest, a leading dental benefits administration leader. He joined OverJet, a leading AI dental company, in June 2019 as COO and one of the key members of the early team.

Deepak was the founding CTO at Overjet, along with Wardah, Deepak's classmate from MIT. Deepak, like Shaju, not only has a deep understanding of how to build robust and high performance platforms, but experience building from day 0 for scale to touch hundreds of thousands of patients. Deepak was quoted by many as the “driving force behind OverJet's technology” and Shaju was responsible for driving OverJet's payer strategy, which now makes up ~75% of its revenue. Both have had the privilege of working together in a 0 -> 1 capacity at OverJet, and those lessons have already served them well in the early days at 32Health.

Shaju and Deepak left OverJet to solve a key need they saw in market for years to address issues for all dental claims, rather than the ~10% that OverJet focuses on today. This difference in vision led to a friendly and planned departure from OverJet earlier this year. Shaju and Deepak are industry leaders, not simply tech guys looking to bring AI into an antiquated industry they don't understand, and are motivated by their desire to be true co-founders and leaders to build an industry defining business.

This vision gives us confidence they can attract the 3 C's - capital, customers, and community. We've seen from their clear line of sight to $1M+ ARR potential and downstream investor interest that they can attract capital from healthcare and tech investors alike. Customers rave about their relationship and standing in industry as well as their technical prowess. Conversations with references, including previous employees, confirm our initial read that Shaju and Deepak can attract top-notch technical and dental expertise.

## Market
Dental is Decades behind Medical. While healthcare is often criticized for lagging behind other industries, dental insurance today is still decades behind health insurance. The adoption of fully electronic administrative transactions (as measured by the Council for Affordable Quality Healthcare below) pales in comparison to medical adoption. Only 19% of claim status inquiries, 16% of claim payments, and 25% of remittance advice was fully electronic in 2021, a minuscule improvement from the years prior.

### Market Trends:
National dental expenditures are ~$140B annually. 2/3 of Americans have private coverage (typically through their employer) while the other 1/3 get their benefit through public programs including MA or Medicare Supplement plans, Medicaid, and CHIP.

*   **Overall enrollment growth.** 80% of the US population has dental benefits today - up from 66% in 2015. Dental spending decreased by 23% during COVID as members delayed dental care and preventative services, but the industry is seeing increased utilization and plans are seeing continued interest from employer customers to offer competitive dental plans.
*   **Government plans.** Medicare has excluded dental (along with vision and hearing) coverage since its inception in 1965. Congress continues to push for comprehensive benefits for all Medicare members, but in the meantime CMS is exploring and taking comments for benefit expansion in certain indications (diabetes, chemotherapy, cardiac surgery, etc). Industry experts are confident that full Medicare coverage for dental benefits is more of a question of when, rather than if. The Congressional Budget Office's (CBO) analysis shows that full Medicare coverage for dental benefits could inject $238B in spending into the market over a 10 year period. Even limited coverage would be a welcome and long-awaited boon to an already rapidly growing industry. In the Medicare Advantage world, 94% of Medicare Advantage plans provided access to dental services through supplemental benefits. MA is 48% of the total medicare population and penetration is growing rapidly. Dental, vision, and hearing coverage are the most advertised benefits for MA plans to differentiate amongst themselves and traditional Medicare.
*   **Dental-loss-ratios (DLRs).** Proposed policies in states like Massachusetts and California are looking to implement a minimum DLR (e.g., how much of each premium dollar is used to pay for dental services) in commercial markets. Unlike medical insurance (with a required medical loss ratios of 80% under the ACA) dental insurance hasn't had any DLR requirements in the commercial markets. For example, average DLRs for small group/individual plans are 68% in Massachusetts while larger plans have a DLR of ~79%. Some government plans already have DLR requirements in certain states. Industry experts believe these or similar policies will be enacted over the next few years and spread to other states. Plans are limited in how much they can increase premiums because of strong competition in a relatively commoditized market. This shift would force plans to “fight back with real tangible benefits” and reduce admin costs to comply with the new regulations.
*   **Integration with the medical system.** Historically, dental care has been completely disconnected from the medical system, but this is changing rapidly in both the commercial and government markets. Kaiser Permanente in Washington, for example, is exploring Epic installations in certain dental practices to better integrate care across a patients journey. Combined medical and dental plans (e.g., BCBS) waive co-pays on preventative dental visits because they've seen that two $200 cleanings per year can reduce costs for diabetes by $3K. This improved integration places more of an onus on software and technology solutions can improve benefits administration and underwriting risk.

## TAM:
Today, there are 264M Americans with dental insurance. Through our industry interviews and 32Health's SOW with its first partner, American Public Life (APL), 32Health conservatively should be able to charge a $3 PMPM fee across the entire member base given that this back-end claims infrastructure is core to an entire plans operations, leading to a total revenue potential of ~$10B.

### Competition:
Throughout multiple customer calls, plans in market today have been looking for platforms to replace their internal, homegrown systems built on antiquated technologies. Tech-forward and innovative plans, including those who have adopted OverJet's AI dental imaging software, have been evaluating back-end claims systems in market for 2+ years without any success. Typically, most of these insurers have ~8 back-end systems for different claims processes and would prefer to adopt one broad system. Competitors we came across in diligence often include:

*   **Skygen (~400 employees, based in Wisconsin):** ~30 year old technology platform providing SaaS platform for TPAs in dental and vision benefits. Based on industry research, they work with 13M members and recently signed a TPA business partnership with OverJet for $1M+ in 2023. Skygen markets that they provide a lot of the same value as 32Health. Potential customers, however, confirmed that the platform is antiquated, would require adoption of Skygen and multiple other systems, and that they have been in market looking for solutions for years and quickly passed over Skygen.
*   **Other insuretech (Fineos, Majesco):** Customers also actively evaluated general insuretech platforms over the years, mainly Fineos and Majesco, prior to choosing to build their own internal systems. These cloud-based insurance platforms are “better than nothing” but often add more complexity because they are point solutions that add to broad range of systems customers already have.
*   **Overjet expansion:** OverJet is focused on analyzing images for the most complex claims (~10%). Overjet's FDA-cleared platform analyzes images to detect and outline decay and quantify bone loss in images to improve case acceptance rate for dentists and speed up the efficiency of dental review for insurers. OverJet's ARR as of Sept ‘22 was $7.9M - with $1.9M from practices and $6M from insurers. OverJet may eventually look to build solutions for broader back-end claims infrastructure (e.g., the other ~90%) to complement their imaging analysis on complex cases (~10%), but it is not on their near/mid-term product roadmap.
*   **Medical expansion into Dental:** Other claims engines (Cognizant, HealthEdge, etc) in the broader medical space may look to expand into dental but lack the domain expertise or organizational focus to do so.

## Product
32Health is building an AI/NLP-enabled back-end claims infrastructure that can replace all of a dental insurers systems of record, including both the back-end database and customer facing UI/UX. Administrative claims staff at dental insurers can use the platform to auto-adjudicate claims, plan directors can iterate on benefit design, underwriters can leverage data to calculate premiums, and internal dentists can analyze data for a dental review for complex cases.

The two initial core features of the product are **auto-adjudication** and **plan configuration**.

**Auto-adjudication:** Customers estimate 80%-90% of claims can be automated but 0% (small/mid-size plans) to 40% (large plans) are actually automated today.

32Health has built the components of auto-adjudication shown below, from claim inspection to submitting the actual payment.

### Auto-adjudication workflow (Simplified Flowchart Description)
The workflow progresses through several stages:
1.  **Claim Inspection**:
    *   Claim payload normalization
    *   Claim type determination
    *   Claim ID assignment
2.  **Product & Benefit Checks**:
    *   Product Group check
    *   Benefit configuration check
    *   Member eligibility
    *   Benefit rules check
    *   Allowed amount check
3.  **Policy Edits & Adjustments**:
    *   Limitations check
    *   Unbundling check
    *   Upcoding check
    *   Benefit policy edits check (applies to Calculate Approved Amount)
4.  **Prior Authorization & Clinical Review**:
    *   Documentation check
    *   Prior auth check
    *   Clinical review
    *   History check
    *   Clinical policy edits check (applies to Apply adjudication logic for payment)
5.  **Calculate Approved Amount**
6.  **Provider networks & contracts** (input to Calculate Approved Amount)
7.  **Apply adjudication logic for payment**
8.  **Create Payment**
9.  **Generate EOB** (Explanation of Benefits)
10. **Generate ERA** (Electronic Remittance Advice)
11. **EOB & ERA calculation**

**Plan configuration:** Low-code benefit plan configuration screens allow insurance plans to provide coverage for 700+ CDT codes and support rapid iteration and launch of new products. Customers take months or even years to launch novel benefit designs with their current inflexible systems. With the initial product, customers provide their own logic / rules for benefits, and 32Health's data model helps surface and automate those benefits. Over time, 32Health will get more involved with premium calculation and benefit design.

### Product Roadmap:
The product roadmap over the next 9-12 months is focused on 4 main areas.
*(The provided image shows a phased timeline for "Configuration & Auto Adjudication" from Oct 2022 - June 2023, leading to "Go Live".)*

*   **Oct 2022 - Dec 2022**: Auto configuration for groups & individual plans. Intake eligibility, provider files, claim files, Auto Adjudication with all CDT codes.
*   **Jan 2023 - March 2023**:
    *   Convert & validate existing groups into 32Health Systems
    *   Upload current claims history from LION system
    *   OCR for manual mail rooms
    *   OCR interface with 32Health
    *   Implement EDI interfaces
    *   Validate EDI interfaces for 10% of the incoming claims
    *   Benefit design data preparation, requirements
    *   What if Analysis tool
*   **April 2023 - June 2023**:
    *   Validate configuration against FINEOS
    *   Integrate OCR for existing plans
    *   Validate payments
    *   Sales Enablement plan comparison
    *   Integration with LION, OSC, mailroom
    *   Auto Risk & Premium Generator
    *   Integration with call center

*   **Payments:** Only 16% of payments are fully electronic today, but 32Health can enable 100% digital payments which reduces the cost of billing and payments to close to 0.
*   **Optical character recognition (OCR):** OCR for manual claims can convert paper claims to electronic claims for integration into 32Health's core system.
*   **Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) Transactions:** 32Health brings automation for numerous EDI transactions on to one platform. The most common EDI transactions are eligibility inquiries and responses (270/271), claims submission (837), claims status inquiry and response (276, 277), payments, and electronic remittance advice (ERA, 835).
*   **Benefit design:** Adjusting plan design, benefit fee schedule and provider fees based eligibility files (EDI), prior claim history and dental images, AI-assisted risk modeling, and different variables to optimize premium amount.

## Business Breakdown
32Health is selling an enterprise SaaS platform to dental insurance plans with per-member-per-month (PMPM) fees ranging from $2 - $5 based on the number of covered lives.

*   **GTM.** Buying decisions for 32Health are typically made at C-suite level because claims processing is vital to a plan's operations. Shaju's decades of industry leadership and Deepak's technical reputation from OverJet provide access to decision-makers at plans around the country. The company is targeting a wide range of plans with the broad functionality of its platform, from 20K member plans (APL) to 4.5M member plans (Ameritas) to employer-focused platforms with ~20M members (Nomi).
*   **ROI.** During the sales process, 32Health does a historical analysis of key customer metrics (e.g., % auto-adjudication rate, first pass paid correctly, % digital payments, etc) to quantify ROI for customers based on current IT sophistication and scale. The company charges per-patient per-month (PMPM) fees ranging from $5 PMPM (20K lives) to $2 PMPM (1M+ lives) depending on the number of covered lives. Customers (e.g. APL) confirm that 32Health could reduce admin costs from 20% to 5%, an incredible improvement for dental plans with slim margins.
*   **Implementation.** On average, customers have 8 different systems for claims processing and reporting functions. Customers (e.g., Ameritas) would replace all of these systems with 32Health based on its current product roadmap. The implementation process requires working with the IT team for key integrations and working with the insurance plan to translate their rules and policies into 32Health's data model.
*   **Margins.** 32Health is projecting ~70% gross margins at scale. The company is investing early in product prior to the planned Q2 2023 launch to lay a strong technical foundation for a scalable platform vs. one-off, custom implementations. For reference, OverJet's margins were closer to 50%-60%. OverJet's margins are inherently limited, however, because its product addresses a small percentage of claims (10% of complex claims that need medical review) and is transactional vs. SaaS-based.

**Becoming a dental plan.** For the foreseeable future, 32Health is focused on building out its SaaS platform to serve dental insurance plans. Over time, 32Health may have the opportunity to build its own dental plan in the Medicaid and Medicare Advantage dental insurance market. The capital and regulatory requirements for dental insurers pale in comparison to health insurance companies, especially compared to MA plans and PACE organizations we have experience with.

## Moat / Durable Advantages
32Health's initial relationships and customer pipeline give us confidence the company can reach $1M in ARR. What are the moats and durable advantages that allow 32Health to scale to $10M, $30M, or $100M+ ARR?

*   **Product Innovation.** 32Health's initial product (e.g., auto-adjudication and underwriting capabilities) drives immense value for both small, mid-size, and large dental plans. The company can use this initial foothold to layer on additional product features to make the product sticky, including OCR, smart plan design, and provider contracting. 32Health's industry relationships and market timing can drive a rapid initial revenue ramp, but continued product innovation provides a durable moat against competitors and ensures continued value for customers.
*   **Data.** 32Health is initially leveraging 3rd-party dental claims data to build their data models. Over time, the company will gather longitudinal claims data across its customer base and have unparalleled access to dental claims data in real-time. This data can help 32Health auto-adjudicate a higher percentage of claims, improve benefit design, and compete against fast-followers who might enter the space.
*   **Compounding ROI (Snowball effect).** Initial ROI analyses (sheet here) show 32Health can drive an 80% reduction in expense ratios for dental plans. 32Health can demonstrate this ROI in weeks or months, rather than years, because claims processing is the core piece of a plan's operations and there is such a strong need and pull from market. This dynamic creates a snowball effect where 32Health's initial wins compound and can make 32Health the de-facto standard in market.

## Financing, Burn, and Milestones
**Financing:** Virtue is leading a $3M SAFE at $19M post-money cap, with $900K from Virtue's core fund (4.7% ownership) and $600K in an SPV from Nomi Health (15% Carry, effective ownership of 2.37%). This effectively brings Virtue's total investment to $1.35M, 7.11% weighted ownership after the financing.

**Burn:** >90% of burn over the next 12-18 months is on headcount. 32Health is simultaneously investing in engineering, product, and business development to hit their growth goals. The company is bringing on 2 back-end engineers and 1 front-end engineer over the next 3-6 months to support Deepak. In addition, 32Health is in conversations with a dental insurance product specialist from Ameritas and a seasoned BD executive to support customer conversations and building out the pipeline in tandem. With this initial hiring plan, 32Health is targeting an average monthly burn rate <$175K (gross, assuming no revenue) to ensure 18 months of runway.

**Milestones:** With this $3.135M round, 32Health wants to build a fully automated dental benefit configuration and automation product and acquire 1M members.

*   **Product:** 32Health's product goal is to have fully automated dental benefit configuration and adjudication by Nov 2023. The metrics the company is measuring to hit this goal are 1) a reduction in cost of dental administration by 80% and 2) reducing the speed to market for new products from months to weeks
*   **Member / Revenue Target:** 32Health's goal is to have signed contracts from dental/vision insurance companies, health plans, and employer group segments to reach a million members. The metrics the company is measuring for this goal are 1) contracted ARR of $10M in 12 months and 2) a robust sales pipeline to support future growth following a subsequent Series A.

**Success Story:** As a requirement for every investment, we go through the exercise of what we need to believe to be true for this company to return the entire fund ($31.25M). For 32Health, a SaaS company with ~70% gross margin potential, returning the fund means potential to scale to $100M+ ARR as a SaaS platform (vs. a dental insurance plan). In this future scenario, 32Health will have to sign up multiple “APL-like” customers, expand to medical/dental plans, secure large Delta Dental plans for 5M members. They will also have to maintain this top line revenue and growth over time with improved product features for land-and-expand opportunities and to beat out any impending competition.

As we think about building an entire portfolio of uncorrelated assets, we note how 32Health fits into our other 9 investments - looking at attributes like buyer, user, business model, capital efficiency, bandwidth/engagement, and risk profile. A list of these metrics for all portfolio companies can be found here.

## Opportunities / Risks
### Opportunities
*   **Founder-market fit.** 10-15 years ago Shaju was building dental image analysis hardware and software using optical lenses from his ophthalmology engineering work. Leaders in industry see him as the go-to expert on innovative technology in the dental space. Deepak was a CTO/co-founder at OverJet and is consistently recognized by his peers as the driving force behind Overjet's industry-leading technology. Multiple references in the dental industry pegged them as “unicorns” given their backgrounds in dental and technology. The trust Shaju and Deepak have cultivated in the dental world over their careers is just as important in a relationship-driven industry like dental insurance. Great technology, timing, and trust from customers can supercharge GTM for its best-in-class product.
*   **Market timing and pull.** Ameritas (4.5M members) recently allocated $100M for tech transformation initiatives. This is only one example of the massive market pull for 32Health's platform. Customers across the dental insurance market are actively looking for claims processing solutions and want to invest in novel technology, but are constantly disappointed with current options. 32Health fills a vital market need at a time when the industry is rapidly evolving with increased enrollment, DLR changes, increased competition, and frustrated dental providers.
*   **High-gross margins / capital efficiency.** We want to back companies that can have the characteristics of high-growth tech stocks (revenue growth, gross margins, capital intensity, stickiness, etc). 32Health is building a SaaS platform that commands high PMPM fees and can scale to 70% gross-margins capital efficiently. With its focus on building a scalable platform that is flexible and extensible for multiple customers, rules engines, and benefit designs, 32Health can lay the foundation to scale from its first customer to the next 10.

### Risks:
*   **Price compression (ROI overstated over long-term).** Dental plans have such archaic claims systems internally that 32Health's modern platform can reduce expense ratios by ~80%, a huge relative impact. It may prove difficult, however, for 32Health to justify its value over years 2, 3, and beyond as the overall relative year-over-year impact of its solution is less pronounced. To mitigate this risk, 32Health is embedding its platform a key component of operations that can not be replaced (pricing power) and investing in innovative product features to layer on to its core platform (up-sell opportunities).
*   **Enterprise sales cycles.** 32Health is seeing strong pull in market from innovative dental plans and companies that Shaju and Deepak have relationships with from their experience in the dental space. Even with these relationships, sales cycles can take 12-18 months. As the company expands outside of the early adopter group, sales cycles may be extend even longer and slow growth. To mitigate this risk, 32Health is starting with small/mid-size insurance plans that can move quickly and generate strong initial ROI.
