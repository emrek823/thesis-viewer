### Mango Loop Background & Strategy

- Family office fund with $3B wealth from semiconductor business
- Blueprint Equity GP Bobby Ocampo (career investor, 15-year relationship with Evan)
- Extracted $1B from family portfolio for Mango Loop
	- Focus: emerging managers, small funds
	- Check sizes: $10-40M (slightly mismatched with emerging manager focus)
	- Investment types: VC funds, PE funds, independent sponsors, direct co-investments
- Started officially 2 months ago, made 5 commitments totaling $90M
	- Next commitment would bring total to $110-120M for year
- Strategy: tech-oriented, higher bar on everything especially venture
	- “Most LPs suck, most GPs suck, we can be better”
	- Hired Andrew Antonucci from private equity/hedge fund background

### Virtue Fund One Performance Update

- Investment period completed April 2025 (Q3 2021 - Q2 2025)
	- 75%+ positions led by Virtue
	- Co-investors include a16z, Bessemer, GV
- Strong Q4 2025 marks across 4-5 Fund 1 companies plus Fund 2 company (Guide)
	- Translucent: 5x step-up from seed to Series A in 6 months (led seed, syndicated to NEA/FPV, then GV preempted Series A at $27M)
	- Prudent: competitive Q4 Series A, signed term sheet with Lightspeed
	- 32health: signed convertible with dental partner at step-up
	- Anna: 20%+ ownership, $17.5M term sheet with Transformation Capital
	- Integral: expecting double-digit multiple on Series B term sheet this week

### Fund Performance Projections & Portfolio Status

- Already returned over half of Fund 1 via SmartDx exit ($1.1B outcome, 3 years from wire to announcement)
- Current projection: 3x minimum, targeting north of 5x for Fund 1
	- Top quartile certain, likely top decile performance
	- Portfolio mix expected: some home runs/grand slams plus triples/doubles
- 90%+ Series A graduation rate (one company - Tuva - didn’t raise Series A despite $3M revenue)
- Portfolio segmentation on AI adoption:

### Strategy Evolution & Market Positioning

- Fund 2: 4 companies invested, only institutional investor in 2 of 4 deals
- Increased focus on being sole institutional investor in early rounds
	- Higher noise-to-signal ratio in seed market pushing toward edge opportunities
	- Trust own decisioning process, don’t need external validation
- Care delivery investment bar significantly raised vs 4 years ago
	- Still investing but requiring multi-billion dollar venture outcome potential
	- Market appetite decreased for companies needing $30-50M Series A/B rounds
- Zero-to-one healthcare opportunity larger than anticipated 4 years ago
	- Limited viable standalone digital health firms (Virtue, Meridian Street)
	- Tier 1 generalist firms asking “who are these guys?” about healthcare specialists

### GPV Merger Opportunity

- Potential merger with GPV (Andrew Perlman, $1.6B AUM)
- Structure: new management company overseeing 3 vehicles
- Terms: equal partnership, Virtue becomes go-forward brand, full investment decisioning authority
- Value proposition: 20+ healthcare system partnerships (Kaiser, UPMC), payer relationships
	- Could accelerate portfolio company customer acquisition by 15+ months
	- Maintain 60-80% Series A graduation rate through de-risking
- Concerns: one-way door decision, unknown unknowns, autonomy questions
- Receiving formal documentation within 24 hours for legal review

### Mango Loop Investment Consideration

- Alternative to GPV merger: $20-30M parallel fund with Mango Loop
- Would enable same strategy with more firepower per position
	- Additional $0.5-1.5M per investment on average
	- Translates to 5%+ additional ownership per position
- Allows 1-2 year evaluation period before committing to larger structural changes
- Could support more concentrated portfolio (fewer companies, larger positions)
- Reserve strategy improvement: 20% reserves in 10-20% of positions vs current 40-45%

### Process & Timeline

- Mango Loop memo preparation in progress, references being completed by Thursday
- Bobby Ocampo meeting scheduled for Thursday next week
- GPV accelerating timeline, creating parallel decision pressure
- Fund size discussion: $20M minimum, potentially up to $30M
- Standard terms: 2% blended fee (starts 2.5%, steps down), 20% carry (25% if 4x+ return)
- Due diligence: background checks can leverage existing Sandana work, operational due diligence standard process

### Next Steps

- Evan to complete memo and references this week
- Bobby meeting Thursday to discuss sizing and approval
- Sean to determine optimal fund size (20-30M range)
- Legal review of both GPV and Mango Loop opportunities
- Decision needed by end of year for 2026 strategy planning
