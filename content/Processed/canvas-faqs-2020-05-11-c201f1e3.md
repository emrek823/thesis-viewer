# FAQs

## What kind of terms are you expecting from your first payer distribution deal and from subsequent deals at scale?

The common unit of value between payers and providers is the patient/member, so the only pricing structure that works is a pmpm / per member per month fee. And then we just have a monthly minimum. With our first distribution deal, currently in contracting, the $1.2m ACV is made of $2 pmpm with $100k monthly minimum (i.e. the payer takes on practice adoption risk), which maps to 50k members / 100 doctors / 25 practices. That's just the start of this one deal, and it represents way less than one percent of the payer's membership. In the "land and expand" construct, our “land” deal is huge, over $1m, and expansions at a single large payer can easily reach $10m ACV in a couple of years and top out around $50m ACV. From one deal.

For subsequent deals, the main difference in deal structure is whether the payer is a "charter payer" or a follower. We expect only a dozen or so charter payers but hundreds of followers. The charter payer for a practice is the one who subsidizes the Canvas switch. In exchange for carrying that cost for us, they get a blend of first-mover advantages we call charter entitlements. The first entitlement is a discounted pmpm, e.g. $2 pmpm instead of $4 pmpm. The second entitlement is a cut of the follower payers' pmpm streams. This solves so many incentive problems at the same time it feels like magic, but it's just the rules of the game. The charter payer no longer insists on exclusivity. They get a revenue stream that is not 80/20 margin-capped like premiums. They (and we) effectively gain a way to extract rent as a utility.

On balance we expect to net average revenue of $2 pmpm from both charter and follower payers. Primary care providers have about 1,500 empaneled patients on average and we expect to contract with about 50% of the payer mix. So on a per doctor basis that's 750 patients whose insurers are netting us $2 pmpm for them to be cared for via Canvas. For us it becomes $18k/doc/year, which is 3x the initial charter payer value and 3-5x more value than every competing SaaS EMR.

## It seems too soon and too complicated to sell to payers and you have an amazing EMR. Why not sell it directly to practices?

It's fair to say that's been our prior belief through 2019. As recently as February my two industry veteran directors Jeff and Bryan said collectively: You're out of your mind, you're 2 years away from a payer deal.

Historically, when a practice considers switching EMRs, they forecast large costs associated with the switch: one-time data migration costs, setup costs to redo partner integrations, and lost revenue to make time for training. New-entrant EMRs face a fourth type of switching cost, which is the risk that practices perceive in switching their mission-critical infrastructure technology to a small company with a short history.

Altogether, high switching costs have resulted in low conversion rates for outbound EMR replacement sales, especially for start-ups. We're building a low-cost inbound sales funnel to convert practices that come to Canvas regardless of their source. But insurers are our core distribution mechanism because they generate a high outbound conversion rate. They increase conversion in two ways: with a financial subsidy and with their imprimatur, which together reduce practices' cost and perceived risk of switching. And it turns out insurers will pay that subsidy and provide that endorsement today. Here's why:

1. Primary care docs are desperate for a better business model, not just a better EMR experience, and bundling with payers is blowing their minds. With Canvas, providers get money faster from insurers while simplifying their workflows (we replace 5-10 siloed software vendors¹), eliminating their technology costs (insurer pays for Canvas), eliminating excess revenue cycle labor costs (instant settlement means fewer billers and collectors on staff), and increasing clinician productivity by 30% as measured by revenue per hour of available clinician capacity.
2. Payers are desperate to tie payment to value, and have broadly failed to do it because historically it decreases productivity and increases cost. Payer initiatives to tie payments to value have required providers to shoulder additional labor costs amounting to $50k per clinician per year (that's 10% of revenue). For example, payers have demanded that providers use 3rd-party web "portals" to guide care, but providers then have to hire additional staff to use the portals and act on the information. As a result, providers have balked at the prospect of continuing to carry these labor costs in exchange for a chance at additional performance-based revenue a year or more into the future. A Top-5 payer is rushing to move first with Canvas because, in their words, there is no other way.
3. Yes this strategy is more complex than a direct sale but it results in 3-5x more revenue per physician than any other SaaS EMR. We generate $18k per clinician per year while those legacy players make at most $4-6K per clinician per year. How is that possible? We do that by monetizing where value accretes: not the provider but their many payers.

Canvas is priced at $4 pmpm (per member per month) for insurers, where "member" in the payer vernacular means "patient" in the provider universe. A full time primary care provider has about 1.5-2k patients attributed to them. Most of those patients will be represented by one of the top 5 insurers, and that is where we are concentrating our efforts. The long tail of smaller insurers will come later.

The first payer to work with us in a practice is the charter payer and they subsidize the switching cost — both directly in terms of money but also in terms of dramatically reducing the perceived risk in betting the practice on a young technology company. In exchange for being a charter payer, they get a discount off their pmpm (e.g. they pay us $2 instead of $4), and they also get a cut of follower payers' pmpm.

As a simple representative example, take a physician with 1.5k patients attributed to them. United is 25% of patients, Anthem is 15%, and Aetna is 10%. United would be the charter payer for this physician, and we also have a deal with Anthem and Aetna. United pays us $750 = $2 x 375 patients, and Anthem and Aetna together pay us $4 x 375 which we see half of. That's $1,500 per month per clinician, $18k per clinician per year.

## How far away do you think you are from a bona fide payer deal?

We're at the end of due diligence right now with one of the 5 largest insurers in the country, actively redlining, already setting up project teams. In 3-4 weeks they will make a $120k non-refundable deposit in our bank account. That deposit will kick off a 2-month technical POC (procedural) that will become a 3-year $1.2m minimum ACV deal. We expect that to be final in July. As mentioned the speed and scale of this deal has surprised even the most savvy observers. Bottom line is that covid has thrown independent practices on life support and insurers are desperate to keep them independent to avoid monopoly pricing from consolidation. Canvas is the simplest way to keep them independent while gaining the kind of tight coordination that vertically-integrated systems benefit from.

Below is one of the top 5 payer's own internal slides on the components of this initiative, you can see Canvas is the fabric, we enable every single level of the stack, EMR is only one of five! This is not aspirational. This is what we do right now.

## Aren't providers anxious about a single payer subsidizing their EMR? What happens if the provider doesn't want to contract with the payer after a period of time?

We are working with our charter payers to go to market initially with practices where the payer represents a large 20-50 percent share of patients. That neutralizes this concern initially, because the practice is already heavily dependent on the charter payer and they already have their existing contract term, which is likely to be refreshed with the Canvas deployment. If needed we can backstop the deal with a safety net "unsubsidized" price after the contracted payer term, should they separate. But by that time we anticipate the practice will have one or more follower payers activated and full comfort with Canvas as a payer-agnostic platform.

## Providers are struggling from the pandemic, isn't that bad for you?

Doctors are certainly struggling. Payers need independent practices to remain independent in order to avoid a worst-case scenario of (1) stronger vertically-integrated competitors e.g. OptumCare and (2) even more potent hospital bargaining power and associated monopoly pricing e.g. Sutter. So payers will do whatever it takes to keep practices independent. Canvas is the simplest solution for independent practices to stay independent while enabling the kind of tight coordination with payers that vertically integrated systems benefit from. That's why our top-tier insurer conversations are moving so quickly and why they are so willing to subsidize switching costs. In short, payers are engineering the outcome where independent clinics remain independent and healthy via Canvas.

## What metrics do you consider to be indicative of product success?

On the payer side it's (1) % of claims under real-time adjudication, (2) aggregate HEDIS score which is a standard measure of care quality, (3) MLR / medical loss ratio against benchmark and (4) NPS. On the provider side it's (1) productivity as $ per hour of available capacity and (2) NPS. On both sides of our solution the first metric I listed is immediately measurable, and so is NPS. On the payer side, HEDIS increase and MLR reduction take at least a year to measure, but that's ok since we have immediate success signals in the meantime.

## $5 million seems like not enough money for what you're talking about, how does your plan square up?

We are confident that $5 million is enough to hit our milestones: 4 payer deals with $1m+ ACV each, 150 practices live, 600 doctors, and 150,000 monthly active patients by the end of 2022. Payer distribution is capital efficient and our expenses are tied to growth. Additional capital is not necessary; it is unlikely to increase the number of payer deals we get done in the next 2.5 years. But additional capital would increase the number of practices, doctors, and patients we support within those deals. We've developed several operating plan scenarios for how Canvas would deploy additional capital that we are happy to discuss in detail.
