### Steve’s Background

- Georgia Tech CS graduate → Intuit (FDMS team - financial data migration)
	- Transformed data from Amazon, Stripe etc. into Intuit models
	- Left due to slow pace, wanted higher impact role
- Candid Health founding engineer (4 years)
	- Led early development of rules engine (core business function)
	- Worked on financial platform in later years
	- Close collaboration with ex-Palantir team: Nick Perry, Doug Proctor, Steve Yazar

### Virtue’s Investment in Eitri

- Investment thesis: $350B+ biomanufacturing market with policy tailwinds
	- Biosecure Act driving domestic investment
	- $300B+ announced biopharma investments in 2025 alone
- Eitri differentiation vs incumbents
	- Legacy systems (LIMS, ELNs, MES) struggle with AI integration
	- No interoperability incentives for existing players
	- Eitri building comprehensive platform rather than niche biology optimization
- Revenue driver potential: predicting yield improvements worth $20M+ per product
	- Complex therapies (RNA, cell/gene, bispecifics) = 7-8 figure deals even in clinical trials
	- CDMO margins 30%+ with high stickiness once implemented

### Key Milestones Before Series A

- Nail the wedge strategy
	- Choose focus: tech transfer, batch record review, process optimization, digital twins
	- Balance total ACV vs implementation speed vs strategic positioning
- Commercial traction targets
	- Secure biopharma client in higher volume modalities (RNA, antibodies vs cell/gene)
	- Land CDMO partner, ideally top-tier (Lonza, Catalent level)
	- Demonstrate cross-platform value between biopharma + CDMO relationships
- Platform development risks Steve identified
	- Wild west situation with process document formats (vs standardized RCM specs)
	- Need extensive research on document breadth to build generic solution
	- Avoid over-customization for single clients

### Next Steps

- Steve interested in potential collaboration opportunities
- Emre available for follow-ups and NYC meetups (in city every Tuesday/Thursday)
