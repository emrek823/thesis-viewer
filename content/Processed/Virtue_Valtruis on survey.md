### Survey Project Scope & Objectives

- Planning to study AI implementation across healthcare companies at different stages
- Focus on practical applications and financial impact rather than hype
- Looking to gather data on:
	- Revenue drivers
	- Margin improvements
	- SG&A optimization
	- Care team efficiency gains

### Early Case Study Examples

- Handspring (pediatric mental health): Basic AI tooling enables each therapist to see 1 extra patient per day
- City Block: Has 79 person R&D team but struggling with margins
- Various RCM companies: Potential to reduce costs from 5-8% of collections to flat monthly SaaS fee
- Pearl Health: Focused on actuarial/financial engineering rather than clinical outcomes

### Data Collection Approach

- Will conduct direct interviews rather than surveys to capture nuance
- Target collecting 5-7 detailed case studies
- Looking to understand:
	- Build vs buy decisions
	- Team staffing approaches
	- Implementation strategies
	- Financial & operational impacts
	- Cultural readiness/pressure for AI adoption

### Next Steps

- Both parties to schedule 5 interviews each in next week
- Claire and Courtney (Valtruis) to help aggregate existing portfolio data
- Corey to share more details about new enterprise AI enablement company
- Create standardized question template for interviews
- Emre to follow up with scheduling on Sunday
