## Slide 8

Application simplifies payment configuration to meet strategic needs

Configurations are shown in adjustments to visualize member level PMPMs and summarized to describe account and network impact vs historical FFS

Payment adjustment is configurable to match budget targets, align lines of business, and refine incentive programs

Clarify generates a data driven approach to optimize the program
Service inclusions 
Provider eligibility
Best-fit attribution

Inputs generate a base payment model that can be further configured to address root causes of payment variability

Impact on clinic revenue is easily visible to ensure configurations are appropriately set to avoid outsize reimbursement changes
