**Q: Can you speak to the competitive dynamics in the space? What is your positioning vs. competitors?**

**A:** Yes, I can speak at length about the market leaders in this space, which specialties each company excels in, differences between fully automated vs CAC solutions, etc.

**Client**
I appreciate you taking the time to talk. It should be all pretty high-level. I can give you a little more context on the call and the research and the work I'm doing, if that's helpful. We're researching to learn more about the bucket of companies that have cropped up that are doing stuff around revenue cycle management, medical coding, scribes. It seems there are a lot of companies growing, raising, and doing quite well. This is actually our first call just to kick off to understand just where all these companies sit.

Just to hear a little bit more from your perspective, on the sales side at Fathom, who do you actually compete with? Just get your thoughts on where Fathom sits in this whole RCM medical coding flow would be super helpful. Just as we try to orient ourselves, because from the outside in, it's a little tough for me to totally piece it together. Sorry if that's a ramble. That's just a super high level of some context and the work we're doing.

**Expert**
Okay. Do you want me to dive right in?

**Client**
I don't have super set questions. I think maybe just the best place to start, maybe we just focus on Fathom a bit as a starting point. It'd be great just to hear the overview of what does Fathom do and where do you guys sit in this revenue cycle management, coding flow relative to scribes. That would just be helpful just to walk through as we try to orient ourselves around how this stuff actually works.

**Expert**
For sure. Fathom is purely an AI medical coder. I saw on the screening questions you mentioned Fathom, there's Nym, CodaMetrix. Those are really the big three in this space when it comes to autonomous medical coding. You can think of autonomous medical coding as meaning it's completely automated. You don't have to have people touching whatever percentage you're automating. Compare that to something like 3M, Solventum, they've rebranded recently, as well as Optum, where they're the 800-pound gorilla in the legacy technology of computer assisted coding.

Meaning those technologies will service recommendations of medical codes to a coder. It saves them time and theoretically improves accuracy, but it doesn't take out that much cost because you still need to pay for that coder and then you're paying for that computer-assisted coding tech to a Solventum or Optum instead. Nym, Fathom, CodaMetrix are really the big three in the space. There are some other companies that are popping up. Arintra is one that I'm hearing of more and more. I think a good barometer to see who's real and who's legit in the space is, are you familiar with Epic?

**Client**
Yeah, at a high level.

---

Epic is the go-to EHR system for healthcare systems and providers, particularly large health systems like where they own the facility, they own the physician group, those are going to be where the biggest TAM is going to be as opposed to smaller physician groups that are out there and so forth or maybe very specialty providers that just do cardiology or do some other kind of specialty.

I mentioned it because if you go on Epic's website, they have this program called the Showroom. You can search providers that are part of their Showroom or approved vendors for autonomous medical coding. You'll have them in there. You'll see Nym. You'll see CodaMetrix. You'll see a couple.

Solventum, they talk about their capabilities, but they're not really doing it. Just like lipstick on a pig. Arintra is in there as well. There may be one or two others, but it's essentially the next iteration. If you think about to your question before, I can talk through where we are in the revenue cycle end-to-end spectrum. I've been in the space for about 15 years, know a lot about it. I can explain where we are relative to scribes, if that would be helpful. Unless there are questions that you want to dig into based off what I've spoken about.

**Client**
Super helpful. Maybe we get into that piece. It would be helpful just to hear where does the coding come into the whole medical journey and how does that tie into scribes or what we think, what people call RCM companies? Maybe just walking through that would be helpful.

**Expert**
Sounds good. If you think about the medical journey, let's say it's a scheduled encounter that's sitting in patient access. They're doing things like prior authorizations, checking insurance eligibility. That's all upstream, pre-visit, or it could happen at the point of care. The actual visit is taking place. That's where the scribes are. The scribes are listening to the encounters. It's happening. Scribes are more so in the ambulatory space. Ambulatory, meaning outpatient. They're starting to get a little bit into the inpatient hospital setting. That's early stages for the scribes.

The scribes are basically listening to what's happening. They're summarizing a note to make things more efficient for providers. Some of the ambient groups, obviously a company called Ambience, they are touting their coding capabilities, but it's not autonomous. It's recommending some codes. It doesn't really have high accuracy today. They're not really that good at coding yet. They're a threat, but they haven't proven that they're a viable threat quite yet. The scribes are upstream and happening at the point of care.

**Client**
I'm just curious, on the scribes, is that where Abridge and Nuance, those companies fit in the mix?

**Expert**
Abridge is in that space. They've aligned themselves to Epic. I think it's 15% of their revenue goes to Epic. They pretty much only work with Epic Systems, so they're in there. Nuance, they have a product called DAX Copilot. That's squarely sitting in the scribe space. Where coding is happening, it varies. It goes down two different streams. One stream is on the physician coding, and physicians are assigning their own, what are called, E&M codes. Are you familiar with those?

**Client**
Maybe just a refresher.

**Expert**
The reason I mentioned is because the physicians do coding for these outpatient visits. Let's say you go to your primary care doctor, you've got some issue. They'll essentially assign an E&M level to it and say, "Oh, this is a level five, it's the most complex. It's level four, three, two, one is the least complex." Doctors are doing their own coding, but they're not very good at it. When they under code, they leave a lot of money on the table. That's one path where physicians is coding today.

You can use autonomous technologies to come behind the physicians and either eliminate the need for them

---

to code altogether, or it could be that physicians are still picking their code, but you're just going through on the backend and correcting things on their behalf. That's one path. The other path is physician completes the encounter. They still are doing all their documentation, but then it routes to a human coder for them to be the ones that are assigning codes. That's going to be everything that's not an E&M visit. It is going to route coder. It could be an in-house coder.

Meaning hospital, let's say it's Mount Sinai in New York. They have a team of coders that are doing it. It could be that they're outsourcing it offshore or what have you. Where autonomous coding comes into play is it's either eliminating the need for physicians to code or it's a cost reduction and perhaps a quality improvement play to displace the coders that are performing that instead at a cheaper cost and faster as well. Coding is happening, post documentation, but before the bill is generated in the revenue cycle, end-to-end spectrum.

After coding then there's billers that are generating the codes. Most of it's automated at this point. There might be a denial that happens after you generate the bill. If it's coding-related, a coder would get involved in that. The autonomous solutions are not touching things after denial happens. It tends to be more correspondence that you have to do, like calling the insurance company and getting more information, that just doesn't make sense for an autonomous to do today. On the backend, there are things like denials, resolution, cash posting, stuff like that. Coding in short, post-documentation, but pre-bill.

**Client**
Got it. The RCM piece, is that just managing the whole billing process?

**Expert**
That's the end of end. It starts with those eligibility and authorization and scheduling and then gets into coding and CDI is the middle revenue cycle, and then the backend of the revenue cycle is billing, collections, denials.

**Client**
Got it. Doctors are actually doing the coding themselves or a nurse or something will do that in the office.

**Expert**
In the office, they are. It's usually doctors, but they may have some charge entry team that's saying, "Okay, well, doctors assigning the E&M but there is a test that was performed, so let me make sure we're charging for the test that was done or lab work that was performed." Things like that. Could be an EKG.

**Client**
Got it. It sounds like Fathom is doing the coding piece. Maybe it'd be helpful just to hear your take on, what differentiation is Fathom bringing versus how folks are doing it today? Maybe that's just the best place to start. Are you guys going after more precision coding or the outsourced? What differentiation are you able to drive on the coding piece?

**Expert**
I put customers into four different buckets. Bucket one is going to be your large health systems. It would be Mount Sinai or NYU Langone or something like that. That's bucket one. Bucket two is going to be large physician groups. These are large ambulatory providers that are out there. One Medical is a client of Fathom that has primary care offices in New York and across the country. Bucket three is going to be your outsourcing companies. These are folks that the health systems or physician groups are outsourcing some of their coding to these groups. Those folks could subcontract it to Fathom.

The big consideration there if they have data integrations or not. What I mean by that is a lot of these RCM companies, they'll basically just take coders in India, get them a login into Epic or whatever the system is, and then they're remote accessing in. With autonomous, you need data pipes, you need to be able to have the data flowing to you in a highly automated fashion or else the workflow breaks down. That becomes a blocker for many of the RCM. Certainly, there are some large players that are out there like the Ensembles, the R1s of the world where they have those data pipes.

---

Some of them are white labeling, whether it's Fathom or some of our competitors in the background. Bucket four is going to be health plans. Your Blue Crosses, your UnitedHealthcares, your Aetnas, those different kinds of insurance companies, they are called risk adjustment coding for their Medicare Advantage populations that there's a lot of money being spent on that.

Those would be the four different buckets. The differentiation verse today is largely how are we coding it with humans today? What the clients are looking for is it's based on cost savings and second cost savings. It's improving coding accuracy. That way you can capture more revenue.

**Client**
Cool. What does that sales cycle look like? Are you guys replacing 3M or Optum or replacing outsourcing? I'm just curious what that looks like as you guys get scale and sell into. Who are you replacing? Is this more complementary?

**Expert**
It's certainly replacing the human component of it, whether it's an in-house coder or it's replacing the offshore vendor or outsourcing vendor that they're leveraging. One thing that's really important about autonomous coding is it's scoped specialty by specialty. There are large outsourcing companies out there. Omega is really big one, GeBBS is another big one, AGS, CorroHealth are probably the market leaders. They have people and so they're able to service any specialty that a health system has. With autonomous, you're focused on your higher volume, medium to low complexity.

You're not completely displacing those offshore or outsourcing vendors because they can do all specialties. What I mean by that is primary care versus ED versus radiology versus cardiology versus oncology, all those different specialties. With these outsource, they're handling everything, whereas you're coming in and you're saying, "Okay well, I can just do this one component of it." You're not displacing them all together. To your question before, in terms of the sales cycle, with a health system and large physician groups, it's about 10 months on average.

That's regardless of its autonomous coding. You could be selling authorization software. You could be selling denial stuff. Any tech vendor trying to get work with a large hospital, you're going to see about 10 months on average from your first conversation to when you close a contract. I'd say that the range on that is usually going to be six months. It's the very fastest up to some of my deals and taken up to two years.

**Client**
Okay. How is this typically priced?

**Expert**
It's priced very similarly to how offshore coding is done where you basically set up a rate card and then you say, "All right, we're going to charge you this cost per chart for this specialty, another cost per chart for another specialty then you have volume tiers." That way as volume grows, the unit pricing goes down and it's off complexity. The simplest, something like radiology is going to be the cheapest and then the most difficult, maybe it's surgeries, that's going to be the most expensive.

**Client**
Got it. Just directionally, how much cheaper is it? If someone's using one of the outsourced firms and they shift to Fathom, what is the cost difference?

**Expert**
Usually if they're outsourcing offshore, they're looking for anywhere from 25%-30% cost savings relative to what they're paying today in order to have enough on the bones for it to make sense for them. If they're using in-house resources, you could see savings up to 50%, 60%.

**Client**
Got it. Sorry to jump around. Maybe just going back to competitive landscape a little bit, maybe staying on

---

the coding. It seems like Nym, you mentioned CodaMetrix. I've seen their name. Is this market hyper competitive? Are you seeing all these folks in different sales processes or you guys have different parts of the market you're targeting? What does that look like from a competitive perspective?

**Expert**
I'd say it is competitive between these three companies. Whenever someone's going to do an RFP, it's almost always we're going up against Nym and CodaMetrix. I'd say that we differentiate on a few different things. With Fathom, the way that we differentiate is on specialty coverage. We do more specialties than anybody else as well as on automation rates. Where we may automate in the 90% for something like radiology and primary care, our competitors may be in the 60%-70% range. You can also differentiate on the kinds of clients that you have and also the specialties too.

Nym for example, they win a lot of work in ED, in the emergency department space because they got started working with Epic Systems doing ED coding. They have the most clients live and most references from that space. They tend to win a lot of that work, whereas Fathom wins a lot of work in something like primary care. If somebody wants somebody that can cover the most specialties for them and they don't want to distribute work across vendors, Fathom is the no-brainer for them. CodaMetrix, they tend to focus on academic medical centers due to relationships they have. They were founded out of Mass General Brigham in Boston.

They have relationships there and they co-develop some solutions with them and they're a big academic. There's almost within the healthcare space, this academic medical center mafia. Everyone always like, "Oh, I want to talk to somebody exactly like me." AMCs, academic medical centers put themselves in a bucket and then they all talk. That's helped CodaMetrix win some work amongst the AMCs. Certainly, we have some AMCs as well that we work with. I'd say that those differentiating factors are starting to go away a little bit on our competitors.

**Client**
Optum or 3M or however it's rebranded, are they doing anything competitively to try to prevent getting disrupted here?

**Expert**
Optum is not as much, but with Solventum, 3M they're promoting an autonomous coding capability there. They've published some case studies and their automation rates are 20%. They're really low. Clients will typically say, "Oh well, we already are working with 3M, we want to pilot their autonomous capabilities." In all the 300 health systems that I regularly interact with, none of them have said, "Oh yeah, we did a pilot and it's going really well." They're figuring it out.

How I understand it is that Solventum is they're subcontracting to a company called BUDDI, that is largely an offshore operation. They can automate some percentage. It's pretty low, under 50%. They're white labeling another solution that's out there to some of their capabilities.

**Client**
Interesting. On this, guys replacing with in-house or outsourcing, do you have a sense for how much is outsourced today versus in house? That's something people widely track.

**Expert**
If I had to guess and this is across all the large health systems that are out there, the total spend on in-house versus outsourced is probably about 50/50 is what I see. Where it gets complicated is that you have to subsegment them because there's large health systems. CommonSpirit that's out there. One of the biggest in the United States. Baylor Scott & White is another one. They fully outsource the revenue cycle. You'll see announcements with groups that are working with Ensemble, for example, they're an end-to-end outsourcer with Conifer is another end-to-end outsourcer.

The reason why it's complicated when you're saying what percent, you almost have to carve out those that are doing end-to-end outsourcing because typically they're paying for all the revenue cycle like the patient

---

access, the authorizations, eligibility. I was mentioning coding as well as backend collections. They're just saying, "Hey, all of this is going to the outsourcer." We're paying them a percent of our revenue for this. It's usually 1%-2% of revenue. You can't carve out coding from those different end-to-end outsourcer. It just doesn't make sense to the health system based off the way the contracts are structured.

You'd have to first start off and be like, "Okay, let's take the TAM and then let's subsegment out what percent are doing end-to-end outsourcing," because you likely are not going to touch those folks unless you can get in with that end-to-end outsourcer. Next you have these groups that are outsourcing. Typically, inpatient is pretty common and then radiology, the simple stuff.

I mention it because with the folks that are not doing end-to-end outsourcing, they may leverage these outsourcers to plug gaps or they may say, "Hey, for this specialty, we're going to give the outsourcer all of this specialty." It varies, but I'd say again across the board, my best guess is 50% of coding spend is in-house and 50% goes to some outsourcer.

**Client**
That's a super helpful overview on the coding piece. Maybe shifting gears a little bit. I'm not super close to Abridge or any of the scribe companies, but are they positioning themselves as potential threats on coding? I didn't know whether that's where they become competitive in the future or that's their play. Just hear some thoughts there just on the scribe companies and whether there's going to be overlap.

**Expert**
Companies like Abridge and Ambience are out there. Abridge is certainly the market leader and then Nuance as well but they're the dinosaur. Their tech isn't as advanced, theirs has been around a little longer. You got company like Abridge that have raised insane amounts of money. I'm sure you saw this. At the end of June, they raised $300 million and over $5 billion valuation. I think $7 million or something like that on revenue, something absurd. Their investors are demanding them to get into other things outside of just scribes. They're positioning themselves differently.

From what I've seen, Abridge is not getting into coding necessarily. They're wanting to position themselves as the "healthcare AI company". They're getting a lot of pressure to get into more revenue cycle processes and automate things, whether it's authorizations or they're going to look into automating orders and things like that. Companies like Ambience, they're directly going after the coding space and claiming that they're a scribe and coding automation platform. They're going that way.

The interesting thing about Abridge though is that, again, the vast majority of their revenue is coming from Epic Systems, so health systems that are used Epic and they're highly aligned. They're giving a percentage of revenue off to Epic. The interesting thing is that Epic is releasing their own scribing capability that's going to be included. For free, it's going to be included with Epic. Abridge is about to get run over. I couldn't believe what they raised. I'm sure there's some sentiment behind the investors that are doing it.

I feel like they may lose their shirts on this because Abridge, they haven't proven an ability to get into other workflows and theirs is about to get commoditized by Epic by offering this competing functionality even though they're partners. Judith is the CEO over there. It'll be interesting to see how it plays out. They're going to have to prove some use cases. They'll probably do some M&A to be able to expand capabilities into getting into these other product types.

**Client**
That's interesting. I'm familiar with the Abridge at a high level and I think we know some folks who are investors in it. That seems like a big risk for sure. I'm curious, these are just names that come up in the work. I think these are more on the scribe side, but I'm curious if you're familiar with them. Brellium, I saw Charta, I didn't know if that was coding or scribe. All good if you're not familiar with those. I was just curious if you have any color on those companies. Just as we try to map this out a little bit.

**Expert**
The Chartas, the Brelliums, the Camber, I was surprised to see them pop up on the list. I don't know a ton

---

about them. They're not autonomous coding. They don't specialize in this. They're not a real threat within the coding specifically space. Candid Health is getting into it a little bit. They're more eligibility. They're doing some claim stuff. They don't really have any clients or like big health systems. They're trying to break more into that space. It's been more physician groups and a lot of digital health providers that they've been working with that have sophisticated technologies.

The folks that they're adding value to from Candid Health today are using crappy EHR systems that don't have a lot of automation. I haven't seen anything from them yet that makes them really compelling to a health system. I know they have some smart people over there, so we'll see what they can do. Adonis I know quite a bit about. We have some clients that are using Adonis and Fathom, but it's not for coding.

There's a company called Etyon that was recently acquired. It's more insights that you're getting. It's reporting and analytics to tell you information on your workflow. They do a lot of custom build too where it's like, "Tell me your problems and we'll figure out how to fix it," versus "Here's the tech that we have that solves this unique problem."

**Client**
Got it. It's so difficult to figure out what a lot of these companies do, to be honest. They'll get tagged as RCM. That seems pretty broad. I don't know. I'd be curious to hear their pitch on what they do. Candid, revenue cycle management among their website, revenue cycle management automation software. It seems like this is probably further in the billing. That's probably further just in the billing journey after coding is my hunch.

**Expert**
That's what a lot of these companies building cells are doing too. They can use things like robotic process automation, RPA to automate keystrokes but there's nothing really that differentiated about it. Again, I think that they're still figuring out what are their top use cases that they can really commercialize with their clients. What they're doing is really leveraging a lot of more AI analytics to say, "Here's the discrete actions that were required to take something to completion and get it resolved and here's the things you need to fix, so let's build this micro automation for you to fix these."

They're all a lot of onesie, twosie, one off things as opposed to, "Hey, I'm going to automate all of coding for this specialty," versus "Hey, this issue happens 1% of the time so let me just figure out how to prevent this one issue from happening or resolving this one issue." From your perspective, I would be very cautious of any company that's just generic we're AI for healthcare or AI for RCM.

It bugs the hell out of me when I see these companies that are just like, "Oh, we're AI this, AI that," but they don't talk about their actual use cases and what are their top use cases. AI in and of itself doesn't provide a lot of value. It's more about how are you using AI to make a specific workflow within the RCM spectrum more efficient.

**Client**
For sure. It seems like a lot of these are just trying to be more workflow automation type platforms, versus the coding which is interesting in some ways, but again, a little vague in how they're doing stuff.

**Expert**
I'd recommend if you haven't heard about it yet, check out a company called Elion. They've only been around a couple years but they have some really, really smart guys. There's a guy that does a lot of industry research and he's put together a lot of these apps and does a good job highlighting various companies. They have a report on autonomous medical coding where they've broken down like, "Here's all the main people in it, here's their differentiators," and an independent third-party resource that you could check out. Elion is the company name.

**Client**
Cool. I'll check that for sure. It seems like obviously Fathom and a few of these folks are focused on the coding piece. I know we didn't touch on before, pre-care more on the authorization, check-in stuff. Are there other areas of this whole medical journey that also make a lot of sense for AI to replace or other companies

---

that we haven't talked about that are not direct competitors, on different parts that you think super highly of?

A little bit of this work we're doing is a fishing expedition in some ways just to see who's doing interesting stuff and should we try to talk to. I'm just curious if you think there are other parts of this medical journey, healthcare ecosystem that make a lot of sense and companies that you're aware of that you think are doing interesting stuff.

**Expert**
Two companies I like. One is called Regard. They're in the RCM space for clinical documentation improvement, but they're also a clinical documentation support tool. What they do is they make it more efficient for providers to understand all the diagnoses, the conditions that people have, and make it more efficient for writing up the notes. On the backend, there's a revenue cycle benefit of reducing what are called clinical documentation improvement queries. Basically, people are looking to see has a provider under documented and is perhaps missing some of either the patient's complexity or the care that was rendered.

That way they can capture more reimbursement on it. Regard is doing some pretty interesting things there. Another one that I like is Humata. I know the founder over there and they're focused specifically on prior authorizations. I like the approach they're taking. It is getting pretty crowded with respect to prior authorization companies that are out there, but the approach they're taking seems good from my perspective. When you think about autonomous medical coding, first off, there's only a handful of specialties that are really being adopted at scale right now.

Radiology being adopted at scale. ED is being adopted at scale. Primary care is starting to get adopted at scale. Outside of that, that's probably only covering maybe 50%, 60% of the total volume that's out there. The big jewel is getting into inpatient because that's where the majority of the spend is occurring because there's all the reimbursement implications there. The crown jewel is whoever's able to build out autonomous for inpatient DRGs and be able to capture all the revenue there. I mentioned it because within the category of autonomous coding, there's much more opportunity to be had by expanding into all these other specialties.

Once it's been propagated and penetrated in terms of all these different specialties, the next tangential workflow to get into for incremental revenue opportunities would be within clinical documentation improvement. Coding is based off of what's been notated by the physicians. If you're seeing issues as a coder that's preventing you from being able to code, or you're seeing trends like, "Oh, this doctor is documenting these things, this other doctor is not documenting these things." They're both working at the same facility, treating the same patients with the same specialty.

Let's send some nudges upstream to help providers document better so that way it can support coding. There's a lot of requests that clients have around that. Whether it's Fathom or others, that's where the companies are thinking the puck is going in terms of additional capabilities and features to add on.

**Client**
Is that what the scribes are trying to solve for on the documentation side?

**Expert**
Yes, they're trying to solve for that on the documentation side, but they don't think through things through a coding lens. They're more so thinking through things in terms of how do we make doctors more efficient? Let's just make sure we're capturing all these notes and synthesizing it. They're not optimizing on the coding side because there's a lot of complexity there. Could be something they're doing. That's what Ambience is trying to tell people they're doing. They're just not doing it very well.

The other thing would be on the patient side that we get a lot of requests around. There are clients that are out there saying, "Oh well, you're already doing our coding. Today, we have a big issue where you need to get a prior authorization for a surgery. In order to get that prior authorization, you need to let the insurance company know what are the diagnoses that the patient has, as well as what procedure is going to be performed."

You could theoretically plug this autonomous coding capability upstream before the service takes place to help make that process more efficient for determining code sets for prior authorizations and then being able to quickly identify after the service takes place. What I get told is that this common to receive denials and write-offs, write-offs meaning that they can't collect on that revenue whatsoever for that hospital, so it's a big problem. They have issues where let's say that you have some surgery that's expected, but then once the surgeon got in there, it was a different surgery.

A total knee replacement has six or seven different flavors to it. You may have gotten prior authorized for one, but not for the other flavor of it. The other parallel or tangential workflow that you could eat into with this technology is solving for those changes in services based off what was authorized versus what was rendered to make sure that get this corrected authorization. With the payers, they give you 24 hours after the service is rendered to let them know if there's a difference. You have to write it off.

Got it. Maybe final thought, how do you see this playing out in the coding space between Fathom, Nym, CodaMetrix, maybe 3M, Solventum trying to do some stuff? Do you think there's room for three or four multi-billion dollar companies? Do you think Fathom will emerge as the market leader? Any thoughts on how this plays out?

**Expert**
I definitely think that there's going to be several big. I don't think there's going to be more than two or three big players are out there because it's computer assisted coding today. Computer assisted coding really has an Optum for your main players that are out there and people like to have choices. There's an Uber and there's a Lyft. I think that it's probably going to be two, maybe three where there's going to be the market leader, the dominant one that just has the best tech. There's going to be equivalent of a Lyft that's going to be to probably figure out some niche and be really good at some very specific thing is how they differentiate.

I see there's going to be one big player that's out there. I think what remains to be seen is what happens with these three companies today. Do they IPO and stand on their own? Do they get acquired by somebody big like a 3M or an Optum has such deep pockets? I could absolutely see an Optum somebody that goes and acquires somebody. There are companies like Waystar that are out there that they have a lot of point solutions and so it could be that somebody like a Waystar comes along like, "Hey, this needs to fill out our RCM tech stack." That could be an option. I do see a lot of exit opportunities that are happening for these companies.

That being said, we're several years out in my opinion from being at a point where these companies are making hundreds of millions of dollars in ARR. Today, I'd say about 1/3 of large health systems that are out there either have adopted it or are in the process of implementing it. With that, they're usually picking one or two specialties to start. If you think about it, it's like, "Okay, today it's 1/3 of health systems are even doing this, but on that 1/3, you're probably only touching maybe 10% of the total spend opportunity." It's going to be some time until somebody's really, really reached that critical mass that's going to be demanding crazy valuations.

**Client**
Got it. Maybe one last question. Once, say, a health system or physician group chooses Fathom or Nym or one of these guys, is this easy to switch over or is it pretty sticky once someone goes with a coding provider?

**Expert**
It's sticky I'd say because there's an IT list that's required today. People don't like to have to implement a new solution if what they have is working unless they can save a lot of money doing that. The typical implementation process lasts anywhere from four to six months per specialty. In hospitals, it's not uncommon to have between a six-month to a 12-month backlog in IT projects because there's just so many different things and opportunities that they want to work on. You basically have to ticket and wait in line until then. As a result, it makes this pretty sticky and the switching costs are pretty high.

Makes sense. I'm sure these guys move pretty slow too. This is super helpful. I really appreciate it. We're going to keep doing some work in the space, may reach back out to go deeper once we get a little bit of sharp review here. It's been a super helpful overview so I appreciate you taking the time out of your day and we'll reach back out if we need to have any follow-ups. Until then I think we're good on our end. Have a great rest of day and everything.

I was going to miss one other thing if you have a moment.

**Client**
Totally.

**Expert**
Okay. I think the other aspect of the market that is being ignored right now that there's a ton of opportunity is on the health plan side. That was that fourth customer segment I was mentioning. Today, what's happening is you have millions of people, I think it's 50 million people that are on these Medicare Advantage plans. These are older adults that for CMS you have to submit what's called these risk adjustable conditions where the sicker the members you have that are on that health plan, the more reimbursement you're getting from CMS at the end of the year where they do a reconciliation process.

These health plans, they could be doing 10 million charts a year, and each of those, they may be spending anywhere from $5-$10 per chart with one of these outsourcing companies. It's humans that are doing this oftentimes in India. It's not as big as the provider size, but it's still very pretty juicy in terms of working with these health plans and doing risk adjustment coding. It's just diagnosis coding you're having to do versus procedural coding. There's a good size market opportunity there for autonomous companies to be able to get in and disrupt these large BPOs and people in India that are coding it today.

**Client**
Is that something that Fathom and you guys are going after. Are there reasons why that hasn't been as packed yet?

**Expert**
I don't know why it's not as packed. Fathom is certainly going after. You could see on our social media that we go to these events called RISE. That's a big risk adjustment forum that's out there. For whatever reason, Nym and CodaMetrix haven't really gotten into that space as much. It is hard. I think that speaks to the differentiation in the product because it's not commoditized. If it was a commoditized service, CodaMetrix, Nym, and Fathom would have the same automation rates, we would cover the same specialties.

There are high variances in terms of those automation rates and specialties. I'm not sure if they've tried the tech and it's just not performing to the point where it can be a viable solution in that space. Right now, Fathom is definitely leading the market and has the potential to run the table on it.

I appreciate it. Thanks again for the time.
