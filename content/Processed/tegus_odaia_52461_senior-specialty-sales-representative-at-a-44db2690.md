# ODAIA - Senior Specialty Sales Representative at AbbVie
## Interview conducted on February 09, 2023

## Topics
Sales Enablement, Veeva, Salesforce, Data Analytics, CRM, Pharmaceutical Sales, Healthcare Providers, Technology Adoption

## Summary
The Tegus Client speaks with a Senior Specialty Sales Representative at AbbVie about their experience using Veeva, a digital selling tool, and the challenges they face with it. The representative explains that they use Veeva and a performance tracker spreadsheet daily, and that there is an analytics layer in Veeva that provides alerts and recommendations for calling on doctors. However, they note that they often receive data after alerts have already been triggered, causing a lag in response time, and that they keep their own list of doctors and their preferences since they cannot integrate insights from the field into Veeva. The representative finds the idea of a product that links with CRM and other data sources to optimize call plans and dynamically change recommendations for HCPs to target helpful, particularly if it includes a ranking system for doctors with the most potential.

**Tegus Client**
Hi, thank you for taking the time today. We're interested in learning a little bit more about kind of the whole pharma sales enablement market, including things like key trends, who the new and kind of incumbent players are, pain points and kind of barriers to entry and then a little bit about how we're just thinking kind of pricing models.

But obviously, given your role as a sales rep, we're also really interested in learning more about kind of the tools and features that you see as most valuable being on the field. But maybe just to start, could you give us a brief overview of your background, your kind of role now and your kind of engagement with sales enablement?

**Senior Specialty Sales Representative at AbbVie**
Yes, like sales enablement, you're referring to like Salesforce.com, Veeva and those systems?

**Tegus Client**
Exactly, yes.

**Senior Specialty Sales Representative at AbbVie**
Yes. So actually, we didn't even use that, we use like paper slips that the doctor would sign, selling prenatal vitamins. And then I transitioned into the diabetes space with GlaxoSmithKline where I sold an injectable diabetes drug. Then I got laid off from that job and hopped around a bit. I was with a small dermatology company selling topicals for eczema.

And then I was with Eli Lilly for a couple of years selling another injectable diabetes drug before I was with AbbVie. And then I was with Allergan originally but then AbbVie bought Allergan during the pandemic a couple of years ago, but I just transitioned with AbbVie. But I've always been in the women's health franchise with AbbVie selling the Lo Loestrin birth control pill, the LILETTA IV, which is a buy-and-bill product. And I also sold ORIAHNN, which is a product for heavy bleeding due to uterine fibroids for a little while too.

**Tegus Client**
Awesome. And in all of those roles, have you been a sales rep kind of on the field?

**Senior Specialty Sales Representative at AbbVie**
Yes, all field-based.

**Tegus Client**
Great. So maybe we'll start kind of at a high level in terms of what you've seen in terms of trends around sales tools. I guess, what have you seen in the past couple of years come through? What are you using now? What out there is kind of new and innovative or is it a lot of the classic stuff?

**Senior Specialty Sales Representative at AbbVie**
Well, when I started, we called them leave-behinds, paper marketing materials that we'd leave behind. Now I guess, just over the past few years, we've kind of transitioned. We don't get too many of the paper leave-behinds only, like paper leave-behind I have is like patient information brochures on the LILETTA IV.

We have like digital selling in the Salesforce that we use to pull up to show doctors if we need to view detail or show them any clinical data. So that kind of change. I was always like had a booklet or something that I would pull out just to show them. I wouldn't be flipping through my iPad.

**Tegus Client**
Okay. And do you have an iPad with Veeva on it? And is your call plan on that kind of thing? Or is there any tech that you're using now instead of a booklet?

**Senior Specialty Sales Representative at AbbVie**
So as far as my call plan, they do send us a spreadsheet like every quarter, and they say, hey, this is your updated call plan. So that call plan is basically they just export it from salesforce.com, the online version.

So like in the Veeva app, there's a little like function where you can click it and click go online and it brings you to salesforce.com and that's where you can pull up like your call plan. So the e-mails and spreadsheet is basically just from salesforce.com. But I wouldn't say there's any like fancy tech other than that, that we're using.

**Tegus Client**
Right. So you haven't, I guess, in the recent future, you haven't tested any solutions or anything like that beyond just a call plan from Salesforce?

**Senior Specialty Sales Representative at AbbVie**
No.

**Tegus Client**
Okay. How good would you say the tools that you use are now both in terms of like how accurate that call plan is, but then also when you're in the field, like are you seeing the right providers? Do you think you're hitting your KOLs, that kind of thing?

**Senior Specialty Sales Representative at AbbVie**
Yes. I feel like the call plan is accurate. But the way we get like numbers, they call it claims data, to the IVs you want to sell for example, I have a doctor that orders like five IVs every single week from me, but the claims data shows that they're only using way less than that. So the claims data that we get is really accurate. It's kind of to give you an idea of what other IVs they're using, but the volume amount is not correct. I don't know why it's so off.

**Tegus Client**
Okay. And let's say, for example, like you have a standard IUD, you have like a call plan that you've been for a while. You kind of know what doctors you're supposed to go to. If there's like a new entrant or a new IUD comes to market and you start to see like the claims data for your providers shifting, is there any way for you to like act on that quickly?

**Senior Specialty Sales Representative at AbbVie**
Yes. I mean if I just saw them using more of a new product or a competitor's product, I would definitely like go into that provider's office very quickly and kind of see what's going on. Either schedule a lunch or go there in person, bring Starbucks, meet with the nurses and see why they're using the new one or the competitor's one all of a sudden, what they like about it, ask some questions.

**Tegus Client**
Okay. And I guess, is there anything you don't like about the tools that you have right now? Like is there anything you wish was better?

**Senior Specialty Sales Representative at AbbVie**
No. I mean I kind of keep track, like I have my own spreadsheet that I make. So every time I get an order, I enter into my own spreadsheet. So like all the time, like I pull it out and say, okay, yes, like I've sold 200 this week or whatever. So I don't really base it on data that the company sends me, like I know which one of my accounts are ordering and I keep track of it myself.

**Tegus Client**
Okay. And if you don't have claims data, like, for example, like a new product comes to market and it comes up on the radar and it's for women's health, how do you kind of determine the call plan there? Or is it like, you would go to the standard kind of OB providers and start building it over time?

**Senior Specialty Sales Representative at AbbVie**
You're talking about like if a competitor IUD came to market?

**Tegus Client**
More of like if you got a new one, like if you now had like an IUD and another product that you were focused on, but the new product had just launched and there wasn't any claims information on it, like how would you go about determining your call plan and territory and whatnot?

**Senior Specialty Sales Representative at AbbVie**
I sold the product they even added that uterine fibroids product to my bag, which is brand new. Now there's competitors, but at that time, there's no competitors. I mean I target OB-GYNs. So I just sold it to all the OB-GYN that was already calling on. And some would say, oh, yes. Like if I see uterine fibroid, no, I don't treat that. I refer them out or vice versa. So I kind of who's the target for that drug and who wasn't. Like who had the potential to write it. Call them, my existing targets, for that.

**Tegus Client**
Yes. And you mentioned you use Veeva and the Veeva Pulse from Salesforce. Are there any other key players or key tools that you use daily around sales?

**Senior Specialty Sales Representative at AbbVie**
No, definitely not daily. The only things that I use daily in addition to Veeva we call it our performance tracker spreadsheet where I enter like, hey, did the doctor replied today, I enter that on my spreadsheet. That way at the end of each week, I know how many I got that week to see if I'm like tracking towards my quota.

**Tegus Client**
Got you. And I guess the last time you adopted some sort of new technology then would have been Veeva?

**Senior Specialty Sales Representative at AbbVie**
Yes.

**Tegus Client**
When you went form kind of like paper to Veeva?

**Senior Specialty Sales Representative at AbbVie**
Yes.

**Tegus Client**
And what was that process like? How did it work in terms of like adoption and integration?

**Senior Specialty Sales Representative at AbbVie**
So I do remember like the whole office and we had like a Veeva section of the training where we logged into like a sandbox where we could like log fake calls. I remember I took like a bunch of notes. Like if you need to do this, all the steps. So yes, it was like an interactive training where they had like you could see the trainer on the projector and then you were logged into a sandbox on your own iPad, so you could like learn how to navigate through the app.

**Tegus Client**
Got you. On Veeva, do you have any kind of like analytics layer on top that basically surfaces insights in order to improve the odds and likelihood of you becoming successful in a sale? Things like, hey, you should be reaching out to this HCP just because this person has a history of prescribing things like this and has basically the knowledge and expertise, et cetera, et cetera. Is there an analytics layer that points you in the right direction that Veeva natively has?

**Senior Specialty Sales Representative at AbbVie**
There is and I guess the feature where I just started noticing it was in the past year. In the home page, like a box that says alert, and it will come up and, let's say, like recommendations or alerts. And alerts are like in red. It will show you, yes, you need to be calling on this doctor. This doctor has dropped their data. Which I think is linked somehow to where we get the data, which we have another app called, Oneview, which is like where all the claims data comes through.

But I don't use that so much anymore. That's more for the reps that sell prescription products, whereas I'm just the buy-and-bill IUDs. Oneview doesn't really show me anything. It's mainly for the reps like with pharmacy data. And there's other apps like that, that I've used in the past. One was called Tableau and one was called MicroStrategy, but they all do the same thing. It's all for claims data from the pharmacy.

**Tegus Client**
Awesome. And just going back to kind of like how you started using Veeva. Did head office tell you that there was this new product and it was going to be deployed? Do you know if like your team got it first? Or if everyone kind of got it at the same time? Do you know kind of anything about how it was eventually deployed?

**Senior Specialty Sales Representative at AbbVie**
Well, I'm pretty sure like when I was still using the paper, before I started using Veeva, I was with a small pharmaceutical company. I'm pretty sure most other pharmaceutical companies were already using Veeva. So then when I transitioned into like GlaxoSmithKline, they were all already using Veeva. So it's not like I was there and then all of a sudden, this is like this new thing that no one has ever used before. So I was kind of like the new Veeva recruit, yes.

**Tegus Client**
Got you. And do you know anything around like piloting, like is there a process where a couple of sales reps use the product for, I don't know, a given timeframe and then it's kind of rolled out to the rest of the team?

**Senior Specialty Sales Representative at AbbVie**
Yes, they do that with certain situations. I forget what they did a pilot for. They did a pilot for some kind of speaker programs like how you enter the attendees for if you do like dinner programs with a guest speaker. They do pilot programs often to update the systems for that. And not so much pilot programs for data and Veeva and Salesforce and all that.

**Tegus Client**
Okay. And why is that? Do you know?

**Senior Specialty Sales Representative at AbbVie**
I guess because there's like no technology for us to learn or I don't know.

**Tegus Client**
Yes. And would you say there's like, I guess, I'm trying to understand like if you do a lot of pilots, how many of them do you end up like using in the long term? Or how many kind of convert to being part of your regular software?

**Senior Specialty Sales Representative at AbbVie**
I think I was part of a pilot a few years ago for like the speaker program system, which is a different like application. And I'm pretty sure we did convert fully over to that. But we used to like have to get each doctor that would come to a speaker program to sign like an own like waiver paper, like checking that they would be compliant or something like that with their signature. And then after that, we switched to like a fully digital with online signatures on the iPad after that and that stuck. We didn't go back to the paper sign-in again.

**Tegus Client**
Okay. And do you know, for the piloting, like, is it like a new product that would pilot it or an existing product? Or would it be by region? Or I guess, who generally takes on the piloting role?

**Senior Specialty Sales Representative at AbbVie**
I think they kind of do just like maybe a couple reps in each area across the country.

**Tegus Client**
Okay. And I guess, going back a little bit to the tools that you had available. Like let's say you wouldn't have the Salesforce claims data that you would pull. Like I mean, clearly, that would make your call planning a lot less efficient, but I guess kind of what would be the impact of that? And would there be another tool that you would use? Or where would you go from there?

**Senior Specialty Sales Representative at AbbVie**
You said what would be the impact if I didn't have claims data?

**Tegus Client**
Yes. I mean less around the claims data but more about like the pop-up function that you were talking about where it tells you like if it's an alert or if you should go see a doctor because their sales are dropping, that kind of stuff, what would be the impact there?

**Senior Specialty Sales Representative at AbbVie**
Well, so like whenever I sold prescription products, we would get updated data every week, like in the Oneview app when I would look at it. That's why I've never used the alert function because I would look at the data we would get every Friday, the updated data, and I would see like who's dropping, who's growing and I already like knew who those people were. I didn't need the alerts and the Veeva function to tell me that.

**Tegus Client**
And how did you know? Just because you call on them less frequently or you can tell in your interactions?

**Senior Specialty Sales Representative at AbbVie**
Well, no. Like when I used to sell prescription products, we would get updated data every single week, like every Friday. And I would go in and I'd look at it. And you could compare, like this three months to the last three months and see if they're down compared to the last three months. Are they growing?

Or if there was like someone that I was targeting really hard, that I was trying to grow, like keep an eye on and see if they started growing. So I comb through the data myself. I wouldn't necessarily like just rely on the Veeva function the alerts to tell me like, hey, this doctor is dropping. I probably already knew that.

**Tegus Client**
Okay. So when you're talking about running all of these analyses and looking like three months back and whatnot, are you like actually doing that, like you're downloading it onto an Excel and you're playing with it yourself?

**Senior Specialty Sales Representative at AbbVie**
Yes. Like in the Oneview app, it like loads, like click what you want to see, and it will like have the little circle thingy and it will load.

**Tegus Client**
And how many hours do you normally spend on pre-calls and preparing for them, planning and then sifting through the data?

**Senior Specialty Sales Representative at AbbVie**
Well, I usually like plan my next week throughout the week before and that usually takes about 20 minutes. And then combing through the data, it probably takes about like 30 minutes, maybe like an hour a week, total.

**Tegus Client**
An hour a week.

**Senior Specialty Sales Representative at AbbVie**
Yes.

**Tegus Client**
And because we have heard some people spend a lot more time than that. I guess there are two questions here. Do you think that the product that you're selling has particular nuances with it which results in you spending less time than we have heard? Or do you think that what we have heard is potentially accurate?

**Senior Specialty Sales Representative at AbbVie**
Yes. I think what you've heard is probably more accurate because like once you know their products like for example, I know like doctors that I've been calling on for four years, if they haven't got on board by now, I'm not going to keep calling all them. So that I kind of just like know my business. I know like there's probably like five accounts right now that I'm about to turn, so I'm like focusing on those. So it's less me combing through data like when I have the prescription products.

**Tegus Client**
Got it. And what were the challenges when you were sort of doing prescription product? Did I hear that right? You were doing prescription products before?

**Senior Specialty Sales Representative at AbbVie**
Yes. Well, I mean, the biggest challenge in selling was a lot of times, like you were hitting a wall because of coverage, right? Even though the doctor like wants to write the product, like even if you go in there every single week, trying to get them, they might just can't because of payer mix.

But as far as like combing through the data, it takes more analyzing like sorting, like what do you want to see? Do you want to see four weeks versus four weeks? Or you want to see the last six months versus this six months?

And those managers that I had, they required me to send them a lot more reports when I had prescription products. Like they wanted to see, hey, show me your top 20 writers and show me what they're doing now versus the past six months. And I'd have to like pull that report and manipulate it to send to my manager and I might talk to them about it.

**Tegus Client**
Got it. I'm going to describe a product, trying to figure out if a certain product is useful for the pharma market or not. And I'll try to do as good of a job as I can, and you'll let me know if this resonates or you think you find it helpful.

So the product that we're trying to evaluate is one that links up with your CRM, so call it Veeva. It links up with all your other data sources, let's call it IQVIA, and all the X number other data sources. It's been running analytics on top of it in order to help you optimize and create your call plan.

So things that it's able to do is, by HCP, it's able to give you a score that says how likely they are to be to, a, to purchase your product; and b, based on your business objectives, whether it's, let's say, to take market share or increase price, whatever it may be, it dynamically changes the recommendations for the HCPs to target. And then also kind of gives you insights and guidance on what channels to use, whether it's phone call, whether it's e-mails, et cetera, based on historical data.

This company aims to reduce the time that it takes for sales reps to prepare and then also guide decision makers. While at the same time, they're looking into that and a general trend in the industry that we've been spoken of about is the number of salespeople have been cut big pharma. So having a product that optimizes and makes the salesperson's life more efficient and more productive is probably beneficial.

Does any of those resonate? Or do you think that this is not helpful? Or do you think it's extremely helpful or do you feel that it's been done before? I'm just trying to get like high level reactions from you.

**Senior Specialty Sales Representative at AbbVie**
I mean I would think that would be helpful if like, let's say, okay, rank one to 10. The number one doctors like with the most potential or I'll be like, oh, I just wanted to group all the one doctors and I need to see those every week. I think that would be helpful because like it took me a while when I had the prescription product.

There are certain doctors you need to be in there every single week. And it was kind of hard to decipher like which of those doctors you needed to be in every week based on their volume. That's what took the most time. So I think if there was some kind of ranking system where you're like, you want to see all the #1s every week, I think that would be very helpful.

**Tegus Client**
Yes. And this dynamically does it because it's constantly taking that data and then constantly updating it versus getting like call plans from other consulting firms which are static in time. This tries to do it more dynamically and you have up-to-date information you can do it on your computer, on your phone, on your tablet, et cetera.

**Senior Specialty Sales Representative at AbbVie**
Yes. I mean I think that would be very helpful because like the alerts in Veeva, like no one uses those.

**Tegus Client**
Got it. It's just that they're not as strong and easy to use, like what is it? Is it the product quality that's the issue?

**Senior Specialty Sales Representative at AbbVie**
I don't know. I just think it's just like we get our data before the alerts come up. So I think that's it. The lag in receiving them.

**Tegus Client**
Got it. I mean it's not too dissimilar to the non-pharma world, where the CRMs haven't really done a good job with insights and analytics. And I guess, like on top of like this product that we've discussed, is there a specific way, for example, like you're in the field for a while, you start to understand the HCPs a little bit more. You're able to kind of get feedback from them. Can you then integrate the insights that you figure out in the field into like Veeva on the back end.

**Senior Specialty Sales Representative at AbbVie**
No.

**Tegus Client**
So that's why you were saying you keep your own list kind of like what doctors like and if you, like you said, should go to coffee or not and that kind of stuff?

**Senior Specialty Sales Representative at AbbVie**
Yes, right. Like I signed up a new doctor with the LILETTA account, the IUD the other day, and he wasn't even in my call plan, so yes.

**Tegus Client**
Does that happen a lot? Do you find that people are missing the question?

**Senior Specialty Sales Representative at AbbVie**
It only happens like this new doctor just moved here. So I just was calling on another doctor that's next door to her in the labor and delivery building. So I think eventually, maybe like six months from now, she would have shown up, but yes, she was definitely not in there yet. When I searched for her in Salesforce to add her, she was still showing her old address.

**Tegus Client**
Got you. And like in terms of the back-end tool like the one that you're using, from across the field force, like if you think about your key account managers and your medical science people, do you guys have access to the same notes? Or like if you have a call with a doctor, can the other people who may speak to them see what you've written or what you guys have discussed at all?

**Senior Specialty Sales Representative at AbbVie**
They don't allow us to do call notes anymore. There is a space you can because compliantly people are putting like some crazy things and the company were getting sued. So yes, I mean, like if I see another like AbbVie person had called on this doctor to meet with him, I think I'll give him a call and see what they talked and about what progress they made.

But there's nowhere I can like pull up their physical notes and read something. You just have to like call them and ask them. But you can see like this person called the same doctor a week or when they were there.

**Tegus Client**
Got you. And I guess, in terms of like the best way, you said before, it would be nice to kind of see like all the doctors that were ranked #1, that kind of thing, what would be like in your perfect scenario, the best way to have like to visualize that on your end? Like what would your ideal product look like to be able to be like the most informed about the people that you're supposed to call on?

**Senior Specialty Sales Representative at AbbVie**
I mean I'm a spreadsheet person. So if I just got like a spreadsheet like list like, okay, top half of all the doctors you want to see every week, and they're ranked number one, number two doctors, those are you want me to see every other week. I mean just like that, like a list would be helpful for me. I feel like they kind of try to overcomplicate things sometimes. Simpler is better.

**Tegus Client**
So you would actually like something that kind of gives you a little bit more flexibility in terms of manipulating it yourself, for example.

**Senior Specialty Sales Representative at AbbVie**
Yes.

**Tegus Client**
And do you feel like your coworkers, your colleagues feel the same way? Or is there like a different type of a person who might like something different?

**Senior Specialty Sales Representative at AbbVie**
I think they all want it the simple, the better. Because like we used to get like a weekly transaction report, where it was just like, hey, this is your order in your IUD this week. And it was super simple. It would take you five minutes to look at it, see how many you had, and it was awesome. But then now they changed it, and there was like so many different like cells to manipulate and information, and it's just too much. And people were complaining when we first started getting the new report.

**Tegus Client**
Got you. On a bit of different note, do you know if there is any conversation kind of internally at AbbVie or whether it happened where you've been in the past, but do you know if anyone is trying to kind of build a solution that's better than the Veeva alerts that you have right now?

**Senior Specialty Sales Representative at AbbVie**
To my knowledge, no.

**Tegus Client**
Okay. And you spoke to this a little bit earlier, but how would you say pharma companies kind of react to switching vendors or kind of being more experimental with new solutions? Do you feel like there's a strong appetite for that? Or do you think they kind of stick to what they know?

**Senior Specialty Sales Representative at AbbVie**
I think they stick to what they know.

**Tegus Client**
Yes. Who makes the decision on what software tools to use. At AbbVie, is it someone at the very top? Is it by therapeutic or brand?

**Senior Specialty Sales Representative at AbbVie**
I would assume that they'd have some kind of technology innovation officer or something like that at the top, whereas if they would do something, they might push it out to like all the divisions, not just like one franchise. It would be someone like an executive.

**Tegus Client**
Yes. If you could help me think to how these various brands kind of fit into the pharma, I would say, banner, if that's the right word. Let's say, your AbbVie, you have 10 different brands, I'm making that number up, just to illustrate my point.

Are those 10 different brands run in a decentralized way, independently? They manage their own P&Ls and kind of have decision-making latitude? Or is it really top-down, where AbbVie parent makes most of the, I would say, decisions like technology or how to run your business as well, strategy, et cetera?

**Senior Specialty Sales Representative at AbbVie**
As far as like how to run the business, each different division kind of operates like its own little company with its own like national director. So yes, like a lot of the other divisions, like I've never met one person in some of the other divisions. They totally operate like our sales meetings aren't even with them. They have their own division. As far as like the technology side, I know we use all the same technology.

**Tegus Client**
Got it, so by division you mean like by brand? Or like you mean by women's health?

**Senior Specialty Sales Representative at AbbVie**
Like women's health and they have the aesthetics, then they have GI, oncology, yes. So each different sector, therapeutic area is like its own little company.

**Tegus Client**
Awesome. Based on your best guess, who's the decision-maker by division? Is it like a divisional head that makes the most of the decisions?

**Senior Specialty Sales Representative at AbbVie**
Yes. There's a national sales director.

**Tegus Client**
Awesome. I'm just going to ask out of curiosity, but obviously fine if you don't know, do you know how much Veeva costs? Do you know how much you pay for it?

**Senior Specialty Sales Representative at AbbVie**
I have no idea.

**Tegus Client**
No worries. This is great. Thank you so much. We appreciate your time, have a great rest of your day.
