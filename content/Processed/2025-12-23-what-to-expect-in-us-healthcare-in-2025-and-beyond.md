**Since 2019,** the United States healthcare industry has experienced substantial financial pressure, with industry EBITDA as a proportion of the National Health Expenditure declining by an estimated 150 basis points (Exhibit 1). The decline has hit payers and providers particularly hard—payers’ estimated margins in 2024 could be at their lowest in a decade. Inflationary pressures have not yet been fully absorbed within the healthcare system, and providers continue to face labor shortages. Adding to these challenges is constrained reimbursement growth, where providers are dealing with a shifting payer mix, as the share of Medicaid and Medicare enrollment grew from 43 percent in 2019 to 45 percent in 2023.

![Industry financial performance has weakened.](/~/media/mckinsey/industries/healthcare%20systems%20and%20services/our%20insights/what%20to%20expect%20in%20us%20healthcare%20in%202025%20and%20beyond/svgz-what-to-expect-2025_ex1-v8.svgz?cq=50&cpy=Center)

Utilization rates remain below pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels, adding uncertainty for payers related to patient demand in the years ahead. Medicare Advantage (MA) plans face rising costs linked to the Inflation Reduction Act, limited rate increases approved by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), and additional revenue pressure from risk adjustment and policy changes regarding Star ratings.1With the roll-out of the IRA, payers will incur higher costs for Part D of MA plans and prescription drug plan coverage for the catastrophic phase of coverage. Underlying the cost pressure are: access to recommended adult vaccines without cost sharing; the yearly cap of $2,000 for out-of-pocket prescription drugs cost; insulin available at $35/month per covered prescription; and expansion of the low-income subsidy program under Medicare Part D to 150 percent of the federal poverty level starting 2024. For more information, see the Inflation Reduction Act and Medicare page on the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services’ website, cms.gov. Medicaid enrollment has declined due to eligibility redeterminations while the remaining higher-risk population has claims expenses higher than the current rates. As such, Medicaid managed-care economics will continue to be affected as rate revalidation in many states typically lags behind change in claims trends.

Healthcare players should also consider potential policy and regulatory changes that might arise in the coming years from the 2025 change in federal government administration. Amid these challenges, the industry is also undergoing a shift in growth dynamics. Industry segments such as health services and technology (HST) and specialty pharmacy-related services represent an increasing share of industry EBITDA, rising from 16 percent in 2019 to an estimated 19 percent in 2024. HST revenue pools are expected to grow at an 8 percent CAGR from 2023 to 2028, underpinned by double-digit growth in software platforms and advanced data and analytics through sales of innovative technologies (for example, generative AI) to providers and payers. Pharmacy services could see continued growth, particularly those with a focus on specialty pharmacy. Growth could be driven by increased utilization and new therapy launches. Specialty pharmacy revenue is also expected to rise at an 8 percent CAGR from 2023 to 2028, increasing EBITDA for specialty pharmacies and managed service providers.

In this article, we use EBITDA as a measure of economic health of the industry. Only a fraction of EBITDA translates into net income for the industry, with net income margins in the low single digits after accounting for interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. EBITDA returns enable organizations to generate the capital necessary for investments, including those for enhancing capacity and access, building capabilities to deliver new and improved treatments and patient experience, and for technology-driven transformation.

In this year’s report, we provide a perspective on how the recent challenges have affected payers, health systems, HST, and pharmacy services, and what to expect in 2025 and beyond.

## Many segments are expected to recover and some will experience accelerated growth

We estimate that healthcare EBITDA will increase at a 7 percent CAGR to $987 billion in 2028 from a baseline of $676 billion in 2023 (Exhibit 2). In many segments, improvement could come from recovery from post-pandemic lows (for example, in most payer and provider segments); in other areas, growth will accelerate (for example, HST and specialty pharmacy).

More specifically, we expect to see changes in the following four areas:

* **Payer:** A combination of factors is likely to drive the recovery of margins, including administrative and medical cost improvement actions, product and pricing optimization, and payer exits and consolidation.2Brandon Carrus, Sameer Chowdhary, and Addie Fleron, “[Next-generation payer operations: How to prioritize for success](/industries/healthcare/our-insights/next-generation-payer-operations-how-to-prioritize-for-success),” McKinsey, January 20, 2021. In addition, increases in the Medicare and Medicaid duals (members who qualify for both Medicare and Medicaid) population as well as third-party administrator offerings in commercial insurance are expected to deliver material growth.3“w[Reimagining US employer health benefits with innovative plan designs](/industries/healthcare/our-insights/reimagining-us-employer-health-benefits-with-innovative-plan-designs),” McKinsey, October 15, 2024.
* **Provider:** Outpatient care settings, including ambulatory surgery centers, are growing due to site-of-care shifts.4“Potential US Health Care Savings Based on Clinician Views of Feasible Site-of-Care Shifts,” *JAMA Network Open,* August 14, 2024, Volume 7, Number 8. Substantial shifts have occurred in the home health area post-pandemic in response to patient preferences. Home health continues to expand as a result of increased technology-driven nursing efficiency and fiscal intermediary models (where individuals are allowed to work for loved ones as a caregiver and get paid by the state for that service). Physician services are also expanding the scope of care through integrated ancillary procedures in office and payers’ focus on encouraging treatment of patients in lower-cost sites of care.
* **HST:** Software platforms continue to have a growing role within the healthcare ecosystem, enabling providers and payers to become more efficient in an increasingly complex environment. Technological innovation (for example, generative AI and machine learning) is creating opportunities for stakeholders across segments by automating workflows, promoting data connectivity and interoperability, and generating actionable insights.5Nikhil Sahni, George Stein, Rodney Zemmel, and David M. Cutler, “The Potential Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Healthcare Spending,” National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Number 30857, January 2023. As these innovations mature, providers and payers are likely to continue seeking outsourced support to deploy practical use cases, potentially creating large value pools for software platforms and advanced data and analytics businesses that can offer healthcare-tailored services.
* **Pharmacy services:** Specialty pharmacy revenue will continue to experience rapid growth due to increased utilization and pipeline expansion (for example, in oncology). The growing use of specialty drugs is expanding specialty pharmacy profit pools, including provider settings, where hospital-owned specialty pharmacies are projected to show more than a 10 percent EBITDA CAGR. Physician offices and ambulatory infusion sites are projected to show high growth due to payer site-of-care policies encouraging lower-cost settings and patient and caregiver preferences.

Additionally, certain sub-segments will continue to face pressure. Those include general acute care within health systems, because of site-of-care shifts to non-acute settings; the non-dual-enrollee Medicaid line of business as a result of redeterminations and changes in acuity mix within payers; and retail pharmacies because of reimbursement pressure and a plateauing of generic dispensing rates.

Several factors will likely influence shifts in economics, including changes in payer mix and return of utilization.

### Change in payer mix

Enrollment in MA, and particularly the duals population, will likely continue to grow. MA enrollment has risen by 9 percent annually from 2019 to 2023. We estimate the membership growth rate will slow to 5 percent annually from 2023 to 2028, driven by a slower increase in population of people 65 years old and over, product optimization measures taken by payers to support return to sustainable economics, and expected market consolidation, with smaller payers exiting the business.6“An Update to the Budget Outlook: 2023 to 2033: Medicare,” Congressional Budget Office, May 2023. The dually eligible population enrolled in managed care is estimated to increase at more than a 6 percent CAGR from 2023 through 2028.

We estimate that commercial-segment profit pools will rebound, as EBITDA margins are likely to return to historical averages by 2028. The exception may be the group fully insured business, which we estimate could still be below pre-pandemic levels in terms of margin percentage. Growth is likely to be partially offset by enrollment changes in the segment, prompted by a continued shift from fully insured to self-insured businesses that could accelerate as employers seek to cut costs in the face of rising premiums. Individual segment enrollment is expected to rise through 2025, driven by enhanced subsidies, Medicaid redeterminations, and potential employer conversions through the Individual Coverage Health Reimbursement Arrangement (ICHRA) under the Affordable Care Act.

However, EBITDA in the individual segment is expected to decline in 2026 and 2027, largely due to the anticipated expiration in 2025 of the subsidies expansion in the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. That could lead to a membership reduction of about 7 million over two years as healthier members are more likely to leave, resulting in a worsening of the risk pool. By 2028, the segment is expected to stabilize, with long-term EBITDA margins projected at 3 to 4 percent.

Medicaid enrollment declined by about 6.5 million in 2023 and could fall further by 2.5 million to 3 million lives over 2024 and 2025, our estimates show, given federal legislation allowing states to begin eligibility redeterminations (paused during the federal public health emergency declared at the start of the pandemic).7“10 Things to Know About the Unwinding of the Medicaid Continuous Enrollment Requirement,” Public Health Watch, October 25, 2022. Estimating the impact of these changes will challenge Medicaid players as the ability of states to readjust managed care organization rates may be slow due to a lack of real-time data.

### Return of utilization

Our estimates indicate that in 2023, utilization rates for high-cost surgical procedures had not yet rebounded to pre-pandemic levels (Exhibit 3). In the commercial population, utilization remains 7 percent below 2019 levels, while Medicare fee-for-service utilization is down by 2.5 percent. As utilization continues to climb in 2025, short-term challenges may result for already financially strained payers facing increased claims costs. However, this rebound should support revenue growth for providers. Utilization may not return to the pre-pandemic level, as the decline is partly due to mortality during the first years of the COVID-19 pandemic (2020 to 2021). Additionally, much of the returning care is anticipated to shift toward non-acute settings, such as ambulatory surgery centers, mitigating the full cost impact of increased utilization. Utilization in other areas like behavioral health and telehealth that rose substantially during the pandemic will continue to grow, albeit at a constant rate.

## Payers: Government segments are expected to be about 75 percent larger than group commercial segments by 2028

Let’s look more closely at segment performance. In 2024, overall payer EBITDA is estimated at $52 billion. Looking ahead, we estimate EBITDA to rise at a 7 percent CAGR from 2023 to 2028 to $78 billion as the market recovers, and several segments approach pre-pandemic EBITDA. The likely recovery drivers include margin recovery of the commercial segment, inflation-related incremental premium rate rises, and increased participation in managed care by the duals population. Recovery will likely to be partially offset by margin compression in MA due to regulatory changes in risk adjustment, declines in MA stars bonuses, and technical updates.

Our estimates suggest that the overall mix of payer EBITDA is likely to shift further toward the government segment. Overall, the EBITDA for this segment are estimated to be about 75 percent greater than the commercial segment by 2028 ($37 billion compared with $21 billion). This shift would be a result of increasing MA enrollment, with MA penetration estimated to reach 54.6 percent of the total Medicare population in 2028, and likely continued enrollment growth in the duals segment (Exhibit 4).

![By 2028, government segment EBITDA could be about 75 percent larger than that of commercial segments.](/~/media/mckinsey/industries/healthcare%20systems%20and%20services/our%20insights/what%20to%20expect%20in%20us%20healthcare%20in%202025%20and%20beyond/svgz-what-to-expect-2025_ex4-v8.svgz?cq=50&cpy=Center)

MA margins saw pressure in 2024, dropping to 1 to 1.5 percent, with 46 percent of entities below EBITDA breakeven in 2023.
