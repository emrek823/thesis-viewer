## Executive Summary
Xin is building a tech-enabled, culturally-focused PACE program to serve high-needs seniors in Asian communities in California, who have historically been underserved due to language and cultural barriers as well as a lack of geographic coverage.

The Program for All-inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) has an almost 50-year history of keeping the sickest and frailest individuals aging safely in their community. Despite decades of clinical and economic evidence showing the benefits of the PACE model, overall enrollment and growth has been challenging because of high startup costs and long lead times. For-profit PACE models in the market today, including InnovAge and Welbe, have proven that these models can drive substantial revenue growth with attractive margins.

Patients deserve access to high-quality models. State and federal governments are pushing to increase access to PACE and derivative home health programs to support an increasing dual eligible population. Downstream investors have a strong appetite for PACE assets after seeing the success of others in the space. We believe there is currently significant expansion opportunity in PACE to increase the existing $4B PACE market size (~60K current, active members) to a ~$150B total addressable market size (~2.3M current, potential members).

The first 2-3 years of setting up a PACE clinic are daunting and complex that few can navigate, but the light at the end of tunnel is extremely enticing ($70K - $100K PMPY with 15%+ EBITDA margins). Xing and Yang are a unique founding team and we are excited to support them through the initial phase of their journey to build a tech-enabled PACE clinic. PACE represents one of the most compelling opportunities in value-based care today given its clinical and economic evidence to-date, high PMPY payments, and integrated payer and provider model (Medicaid and Medicare payment stream with onsite PCP, NPs, RNs, etc). We are investing as early as possible to increase our ownership given downstream dilution for this capital intensive build, and leaving the door open for creative strategies to protect our ownership going forward.

Virtue is investing $480K in a $2.08M SAFE at a post-money valuation of $16M (3% ownership) to enable the team to identify a site, submit its PACE application, bring on additional team members and consultants, and trigger a subsequent larger financing over the next 6-9 months.

## Founding Team
*   **Xing Su.** Previously Head of Global Expansion at Uber Freight, New Market Launch/Expansion Lead, China at Uber, etc. Ed: BS/BSE, Civil & Environmental Engineering at Duke.
*   **Yang Su.** Previously a Principal Architect at Quip (acquired by Salesforce), led growth & monetization at Coursera, KPCB Engineering Fellow. Ed: BSE, Electrical & Computer Engineering at Duke.
*   **Notes:** Xing & Yang, twin brothers, were introduced to us via Virtue LP, Bob Chappuis, in the summer of 2021. While new to healthcare, it was immediately evident that Xing and Yang were very strong operators with a unique background that we believe is well suited for building Xin. References have been outstanding and rank as the strongest founder references we have ever had. At the time of investment, Xing & Yang, represent one of the strongest founder teams we have engaged in the last 5+ years.

## PACE History
PACE was created in an effort to help the Asian-American community in San Francisco care for its elders in their own homes. In 1973, Chinatown-North Beach Health Care Planning and Development Corporation (later renamed On Lok Senior Health Services) opened one of the nation's first adult day centers in San Francisco and began receiving Medicaid reimbursement the following year. Over time, the OnLok model expanded its scope of care, developed a new financing system that reimbursed a fixed amount PMPM, and became what we now know as the Program for All-inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE). By 1986, federal legislation extended the new financing system and allowed 10 additional organizations to replicate the On Lok service delivery and funding model in other parts of the country. By 2014, the 107 PACE programs were operational in 32 states. In May 2015, with input from Tom Scully (WCAS) and Andy Slavitt (Town Hall), CMS lifted the restriction on for-profit PACE providers.

## PACE Model
PACE is a national program sponsored by the Federal government through Medicare and the State governments through Medicaid. A central goal of PACE programs is to enable individuals who are at risk for moving into a nursing home to continue to live safely in their homes and communities. To qualify for PACE, a person must be age 55 or over, eligible for Medicaid, live in a PACE service area, and be certified by the state to need a nursing home level care. The typical participant is an 80-year-old woman with eight medical conditions and limitations in three activities of daily living. Nearly half (49%) of PACE participants have been diagnosed with dementia. Despite a high level of care needs, more than 90% of PACE participants are able to continue to live in their community.

The PACE center is the central point of service delivery for the PACE program (10K-12K sq. ft. not including administrative centers) and is designed, constructed, equipped and maintained to provide for the physical safety of participants, personnel, and visitors. PACE participants can be picked up from their home each morning and brought to the PACE Center. They participate in social activities, eat a hot lunch, and receive medical assistance as needed from a dedicated care team. At the end of the day, the PACE van takes the participants back home to enjoy family and friends. Based on 450--500 total participants, a center should be able to accommodate a daily attendance of 80-100 participants. On average, participants will visit the day center 2-3 times a week.

### PACE Interdisciplinary Care Team (IDT) Roles
(Diagram illustrates services around "PACE" central point)
*   **Medical:**
    *   Primary Care
    *   Specialists
    *   Physical, Occupational Therapy
    *   Pharmacy
    *   Dentistry
    *   Emergency Services
    *   Skilled Nursing & Hospice
*   **Non-Medical:**
    *   Social Work
    *   Community Engagement
    *   Transport
    *   Nutrition & Activities
    *   Home Care

The interdisciplinary care team (IDT) is critical to the success of the PACE program. Each of the 11 IDT roles must be fulfilled by specific individuals who are employed or contracted by the PACE organization, which includes, but is not limited to, the following members: Primary Care Physician, Registered Nurse, Master's Level Social Worker, PT, OT, Recreational Therapist or Activity Coordinator, Dietitian, PACE Center Manager, Home Care Coordinator, Personal Care Attendant, and Transport. The IDT is responsible for the initial and periodic assessments, plan of care, and coordination of 24-hour care delivery. PACE organizations must have policies and procedures that delineate how the IDT will operate, how they will conduct participant assessments, and how they will incorporate the results of assessments into a continuously updated care plan for each participant. The policies and procedures must address the mechanisms and timeframes for IDT interaction, the organizations process for initial assessment, timing and process for reassessment before even enrolling patients.

PACE is the sole payer and provider for all of a member's care. PACE organizations receive prospective fixed monthly payments from Medicare, Medicaid and small percentage of cash pay. These funds are pooled and care is provided following a comprehensive assessment of all the participant's needs. PACE programs assume full risk for providing these capitated services and must comply in all solvency requirements (restricted reserve funds, protection against catastrophic and unexpected expenses, maintenance of professional liability coverage, etc.) required by state and federal agencies. Most providers will be employed by the PACE organization but PACE organizations may work with contracted providers it does not directly employ (PACE has network adequacy requirements similar to Medicare Advantage Plans; also requires a PBM). For these contracted providers, the PACE organization deals with claim submission (or works with a 3rd-party TPA), develop guidelines for utilization management and prior authorization, and pays claims within 30 days.

Since the PACE program first began, researchers have examined a range of factors to determine whether the community-based, comprehensive, and financially aligned care offered by PACE provides quality care and reduces costs. Multiple studies have shown that PACE improves overall health (PACE participants live longer) and reduces costs (PACE reduces the need for costly, long-term nursing home care). PACE programs have demonstrated a 24% lower hospitalization rate than dually-eligible beneficiaries who receive Medicaid nursing home services and decreased readmissions by 16% compared to national rate for dually-eligible beneficiaries age 65 and over. On average, PACE members have <1 ER visit per year. In addition, PACE members and their families rate the program highly. 27% of PACE new enrollees come into the program depressed, and nine months later 80% of those individuals no longer scored as depressed. The disenrollment rate for PACE is almost 5% less than the average MA plan. In a healthcare world with extremely low NPS scores, 97.5% of family caregivers would recommend PACE to someone in a similar situation.

Currently, there are ~59K PACE enrollees across 144 PACE programs operating 272 centers in 30 states. A majority of these parent organizations are non-profit given the historical precedence in PACE, and large players like InnovAge, WelBe, and Edenbridge have only recently been formed. InnovAge alone accounts for >10% of the total PACE census today with 6,200 members. For the average mature PACE clinic, the typical census is between 300-350 patients.

There are ~10M older adults in the US today age 55+, with 2 or more chronic conditions, and cognitive of physical functional impairment needing LTSS. Of those, ~2.4M are estimated to be medicaid-eligible, which comprises the total PACE eligible population in the US today based on current eligibility requirements. At an average PMPM ranging from $6K - $7K, this represents a total addressable market of $172B in capitated spend, of which <3% is penetrated today in the existing PACE eligible population.

On the spectrum of integrated plans dealing with complex populations looking to take on risk, PACE has the most comprehensive care model, highest level of integration, and the highest PMPM reimbursement.

*   **Medicare-Medicaid Plans (MMPs):** The CMS Financial Alignment Initiative (FAI) is testing models to better integrate primary, acute, behavioral health, and long-term services and supports, providing participating states to share in savings. 15 states were initially awarded demonstration contracts, and implementation began in 2013. The 2 models include (1) a prospective blended rate model for select health plans to provide both Medicare and Medicaid benefits to duals and (2) a model that allows the state to take responsibility for coordinating the beneficiary's care, called a “managed fee-for-service model (MFFS)". The FAI demonstration concludes in December 2022 in California and is still a demonstration project for the remaining states, raising questions about future coverage for the >400,000 MMP members.
*   **FIDE and HIDE-SNP:** CMS designates D-SNPs that meet certain requirements for integration as Fully Integrated or Highly Integrated D-SNPs (FIDEs and HIDEs). These plans are operated by insurers that also provide Medicaid managed care benefits. Such plans are already required to take certain integration steps that are not available in all D-SNPs, like offering beneficiaries with aligned coverage a unified appeals process for Medicare and Medicaid benefits.
*   **D-SNP (with or without MLTSS):** States can require DSNPs to provide or arrange for Medicaid LTSS or behavioral health services. Although states' DSNP contracts can help to promote integrated care for dual eligible beneficiaries, these plans continue to face administrative and operational challenges in overcoming Medicare-Medicaid misalignment.
*   **MA:** 3,834 Medicare Advantage plans are available nationwide for individual enrollment in 2022, with Medicare Advantage penetration at 42% of the entire Medicare population. At its current rate of growth, MA is on pace to penetrate 69% of the Medicare population by 2030.

For a view into center-level economics, InnovAge, the one public PACE organization, provides an illustrative view. External provider costs associated with contracted providers typically make up 2/3 of overall provider costs with average center-level contribution margin hovering around 20%-25%. Some of its more mature centers can reach contribution margins of 35+%. Center-level contribution margins for at-risk primary groups, such as Oak Street, typically hover around ~20% for its most mature clinics. This ~15% difference is no surprise considering the PACE payment model “frees-up” the 15% of the premium dollar that goes to an insurer intermediary. Typical EBITDA margins for InnovAge and other for profit centers tend to hover around 10%-12%, compared to the 5%-10% range for its not-for profit counterparts. While InnovAge reports adjusted-EBITDA, a majority of these adjustments (M&A transactions, financing-related fees associated with lines of credit, special employee bonuses) reflect its acquisitive growth strategy. It must be noted, however, that InnovAge's ambitious growth plans and financial goals led to concerns around quality (discussed below) and there are additional opportunities for margin growth with a tech-forward approach.

### Illustrative InnovAge Economics
(100% premium capture; no reliance on health plans)

**Risk-adjusted PMPM payment to InnovAge:** ~$7,500 PMPM
1.  **Coordination of Medicare and Medicaid benefits:**
    *   Medicare Part C
    *   Medicare Part D
    *   Medicaid
2.  **External provider costs for participant care:** Represents a significant portion of the PMPM.
3.  **Cost of care:**
    *   Center-Level Contribution Margin: 20% - 25%
4.  **InnovAge G&A and S&M:**
    *   InnovAge EBITDA: 10% - 12%

Since 2012, annual PACE census has grown steadily adding an additional 3,000 - 4,000 members per year. Even with the introduction of for-profit operators in 2015, the overall growth rate has remained relatively consistent. In 2019, the National Pace Association (NPA) launched its PACE 2.0 initiative to support the growth of PACE enrollment. This growth is expected to come from increased penetration of current PACE programs, new PACE programs, and new and expanded populations. The average PACE program enrolls ~350 people and has a service area penetration of 9%, but some PACE organizations serve more than 1,000 participants and have a market penetration of over 30%, demonstrating greater scale is possible. NPA and other organizations are also looking to support the growth of new PACE programs (e.g., Xin) in current states that support PACE and bring PACE to the other 19 states that do not offer PACE today. Currently, PACE is limited to persons who are 55 years or older and at a nursing-home level of care. PACE pilots have been authorized by the PACE Innovation Act of 2015, which allows more flexible guidelines for age, level of care and payment models. PACE pilots may then allow PACE to be provided to persons who are under age 55, persons who are not yet nursing home eligible and to Medicare-only populations.

## Why now to start PACE?
PACE was established as a formal government program almost 40 years ago, a compendium of research has proven its clinical and economic outcomes, and for-profit organization were recently allowed to operate PACE programs in 2015. These trends have laid a strong foundation for PACE growth, and recent market dynamics have only created a more favorable environment for PACE.

A rapidly growing portion of the population receive care under risk-bearing models, particularly in Medicare and Medicaid. As mentioned above, 42% of the entire medicare population are in risk-bearing capitation arrangements through MA and managed care organizations with some type of risk-bearing arrangement provide services to approximately 70% of all medicaid members. For annual medicaid LTSS spending, home and community-based services (HCBS) has recently exceeded institutional-based services and only continues to grow. In 2010, 37% of the $139B in LTSS for Medicaid was HCBS while the other 63% was institutional. In 2019, 58% of the total $162B in LTSS was for HCBS as opposed to institutional spending.

Multiple potential regulations and legislative changes are on the docket to improve access to PACE. The specific bills top of mind for the PACE community include the PACE Plus Act, PACE Expanded Act, PACE Part D Choice Act, Elizabeth Dole Home Care Act, and Ensuring Parity in MA and PACE for audio-only Telehealth Act, along with increased dialogue between the NPA and CMMI. These legislative and regulatory changes have the potential to support access to PACE in current service areas, improve PACE affordability and access for medicare-only individuals, pilot PACE for populations with similar care needs, and expand access to PACE for new communities.

*   **Support Access to PACE:** Permit mid-month beneficiary enrollment into PACE, streamline application process, reduce administrative burden on PACE organizations
*   **Improve PACE affordability and access for Medicare-only individuals:** Enact Part D plan choice, health status adjusted premiums, and two-way PACE agreements (e.g., operating PACE in states where PACE is not State Medicaid benefit)
*   **Pilot PACE for populations with similar care needs:** PACE-specific pilots for individuals <55 with physical disabilities, intellectual or developmental disabilities, behavioral health needs, ESRD, and Alzheimer's disease / related dementias
*   **Expand access to PACE for new communities:** Remove quarterly restriction for submission of new PACE applications, expand rural exemption for mandatory access to a PACE center, allow PACE organizations to have multiple service area expansion applications under CMS review simultaneously

## GTM Plan

**Choosing a service area (4-6 weeks, gating factor):** The first step in establishing a PACE program is identifying a geography and specific zip codes to define the service area for your PACE clinic. The size of the service area and scope of specific zip codes to be included depends on census levels in each geography. The average is ~1,750 square miles per program, but more densely populated areas tend to have smaller service areas. The only restriction is 60-minute one way travel time from the participants' homes. The ideal geography is one that is in a state that is supportive of PACE, has a large census of potential members, and has reduced access to PACE or other kinds of senior services in the area.

Based on work over the last year, Xin has identified areas in Southern California, in particular Ventura and San Bernardino County, that match these characteristics. As shown in the image below, there are current no PACE services in Ventura today.
(Image: Map of Southern California counties, with various areas highlighted. InnovAge (light brown) is shown in San Bernardino. Ventura County is not highlighted for PACE services.)

In San Bernardino, InnovAge (light brown) is the only PACE service provider. Until recently, PACE providers had exclusivity to assigned service areas. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) no longer requires exclusivity and leaves that decision up to the individual states. California is one state, in addition to New York, Massachusetts, and others, that allow programs to compete in overlapping services areas. Recent regulatory changes in California have also created favorable conditions for PACE growth. The state is increasing the Medi-cal qualifying asset threshold from $15K to $130K, which will increase the number of eligible members for PACE. Recent CalAIM regulations also mandate enrollment for duals into Medi-Cal managed care plans or PACE, starting with select counties in 2023 and expanding to the whole state over the next 5 years.

**Feasibility study:** Prospective PACE organizations must complete a feasibility study which includes evidence the PACE organization will either be cost neutral or save money for long term care services provided by the State in the service area. The feasibility study includes commentary and research on the other types of senior housing options in the area (adult day health, ALF, residential care homes, etc) to make a case that establishing a PACE program will be beneficial for the elders in the community. It can also include specific case studies on facilities in the area, census data describing the total population, and Medicare/Medicaid data to better describe the potential population. Typically, a financial analysis describing the planned budget is developed to show financial sophistication and understanding of what is required to build a PACE center.

**Network Adequacy:** Similar to Medicare Advantage (MA) plans, a PACE clinic must meet sufficient provider network adequacy requirements. In MA it is not uncommon for CMS network adequacy requirements to evolve regularly requiring upstart plans to demonstrate adequacy up to two (2) years prior to go-live. Our diligence suggests that PACE network adequacy requirements are less intensive than MA however it is imperative that management closely monitor any/all existing and evolving network adequacy requirements. In expansion markets, Medicaid rates must support severity at the county level as there can be wide variance in payment rates (Medicaid has a set formula, RAF).

**Partnerships and Letters of Support:** All PACE applicants must submit letters of support form local entities in the area. These may include the County Board of Supervisors, County Health and Human Services (HHS), local hospitals, IPAs, managed care plans, among others. While the quantitative aspect of identifying and demonstrating unmet need in the service area is vital, a large part of the process of garnering letters of support is telling a compelling story. Xin must communicate with key stakeholders about why this group of individuals can be trusted with the massive undertaking of setting up a PACE clinic and caring for the area's sickest and most frail patients.

To expedite this process, Xin is working closely with key partners in the area to lend them credibility and form local relationships. For example, Apollo Medical is a large IPA based in Southern CA that would like to leverage their existing facilities for PACE but are not capable of operating PACE themselves [this information has been provided to us by advisors uniquely familiar with Apollo business operations and Apollo leadership]. Existing risk bearing providers that provide senior assisted care and/or operate multiple facilities within a common MSA like Apollo may seek to offload these members to a PACE partner like Xin. This Apollo relationship is one example of a mutually beneficial relationship that would expedite Xin's process, but there are other potential partners throughout Southern CA.

**Application process:** All new PACE applications must go through an initial review process by Department of Healthcare Services (DHCS) in order to move forward with submission to CMS via the Health Plan Management System (HPMS). The initial submission components provide DHCS with key organizational background and financial viability documentation. This information is necessary for DHCS to complete/sign the State Assurance pages and authorize the submission of the full application to DHCS and CMS via HPMS. Below is an overview of all the requirements for the application deadlines listed below.

The Xin team must balance speed with accuracy in this application process given the timelines for applications and review. Minor application mistakes or even typos could result in a rejected application. All new and or expansion PACE clinics may only begin operations on either January 1 or July 1 of a given year ("opening window"). The application windows for PACE are quarterly, with the key application windows for Xin in Q3 (September) given they will miss the Q2 (July) application deadline. These binding deadlines must be balanced with the realities of the complexity of setting up a PACE center. Some centers, for example, have failed a state readiness review because a doorway was not of the appropriate width or railings were too low. These mishaps essentially restart the application clock and can cause significant delays in launch.

**Real estate:** These initial PACE applications only require the address for the PACE site, not that the center is built or even under construction. In tandem or immediately following the application, Xin will begin the process of building a center. For a typical PACE organization, the average cost to develop and furnish a PACE center (e.g., clinic, day center, transportation, etc) is $3M - $4M. Xin is engaging with real estate partners, such as Turner Impact Capital, to identify creative financing strategies to reduce upfront costs and more more quickly. As shown in an illustrative model below with $10M (extremely high range for PACE clinics) for ease of calculation, Turner could provide Xin with the ability to pay rent on the facility for 3+ years with a path to ownership. During the construction period, Xin would not be required to pay rent, which is extremely advantageous given their timeline and funding goals throughout the rest of this year.

(1) Estimated "full rent" and purchase price options assume illustrative unlevered IRR of 9.50% on total project cost.

**IDT:** The IDT is a core component of the PACE clinical model and a key part of the evaluation process. The IDT must be hired and appropriately licensed prior to enrolling any patients. Based on the current timeline, we'd expect this process to begin in Q1 2023. The initial outlay for staffing is typically around $3M (e.g., similar to PACE build) and PACE clinics must incur these costs before enrolling any patients. These high upfront costs emphasize the importance of getting the application process right initially in order to reduce the number of additional delays with high fixed costs for real estate and staffing.

**Readiness Review:** An organization that is non-operational will have a Readiness Review performed by the State Administering Agency (SAA). At the time of the State Readiness Review the organization must have secured a site that will serve as the PACE center, so the SAA can inspect this facility for local, state and federal law compliance. In addition, the organization must have written policies and procedures that are pertinent to operationalize the PACE program, contracts executed in order to provide the comprehensive all-inclusive care that is required in the regulation, and employment agreements for staff described in the regulation. CMS has provided an internal review tool to give PACE provider, but state and local laws may be more stringent and supersede certain federal laws. The review focuses on a wide variety of areas, including evidence of the site's policies and procedures, design and construction of the building, emergency preparedness, site's compliance with OSHA, FDA, state/local laws, and adherence to life safety codes (e.g., protecting members from wandering).

## Tech / Product
PACE will always be a high-touch model of care given the complex and frail seniors it seeks to serve, but the technologies and workflow tools used by PACE organizations today make it extremely difficult to ensure compliance, enable collaboration between care teams, and understand how program changes affect clinical and financial outcomes. Many organizations today have succeeded in spite of their technology deficits, but there is an enormous amount of room for improvement to use technology in order to improve operational leverage. The current excel based process these organizations utilize to enable IDT collaboration has become unwieldy given the increasing census as member of the IDT waste countless hours looking for additional information. The consistent 1.2- 1.5 participant to staff ratio at other high-quality PACE programs (below) shows that other high-quality groups lack this level of technical sophistication as well.

### Participant to Staff Ratio (Consistent ratio shown on graph)

| Organization              | Staff (approx) | Census (approx) | Ratio (Staff:Census) |
| :------------------------ | :------------- | :-------------- | :------------------- |
| CENTER FOR ELDERS independence | 1,000          | 1,000           | 1:1                  |

The founders at Xin considered selling software/services to PACE operators, but ultimately decided to build a full-stack PACE program to prove out the care model with best-in-class technology. This technology platform can make an impact across the entire organization, from marketing and onboarding to IDT collaboration to reporting and audits. Today, most PACE clinics rely on phone-based outreach and manual eligibility verification, medical record lookup, and level-of-care certification.

Xin can leverage technology to measure and optimize referral channels and streamline the eligibility verification and certification process to reduce onboarding time and effort significantly. Tech-assisted charting, shared care plan management, and HIPAA compliant messaging can reduce the number of hours per day practitioners spend charting and optimize IDT collaboration. Centralized dispatching with real-time location tracking and optimized routes can improve the efficiency of transporting patients to and from their communities. A “Patient 360” view enables the use of aggregated data from all systems to proactively identify and measure ROI of clinical interventions in real-time. Instead of wasting weeks of man hours manually compiling quarterly reports and audits for CMS, Xin's technology platform will enable automated data compilation and submission to reduce burden and ensure high-quality operations as they scale.

## Competition
Since 2015, four major PACE operators have launched operations: InnovAge, Welbe, ConcertoCare, and Edenbridge. These for-profit operators are described in more detail below. While Xin will continue to track its competition for competitive intelligence, these players serve more as an example of how to scale, rather than a direct competitive concern. The PACE market is severely under-penetrated and most operators will only build 2 clinics a year across different geographies. As described above, Xin has purposefully chosen service areas that are ripe for near-term launch with favorable competitive dynamics.

**InnovAge:** InnovAge is the largest PACE operator in the country with 6,990 enrollees in Q4 2021 and 6,231 in February 2022, which is 10% - 12% of the overall PACE census depending on the effects from recent sanctions. In 2016, a year after the HHS allowed for-profit operators, a non-profit program in CO converted to for-profit status with an investment from Welsh-Carson (and later Apax Partners). In 2016, InnovAge had $234M in top-line revenue across 8 centers with 3,100 participants in CO, CA, and NM. Over the next 5 years, InnovAge would grow to $567M in revenue across 16 centers in 5 states. The company has utilized its first-mover advantage and private equity backers to go on an acquisition spree across the country and acquire PACE programs and convert them to for-profit. In FY 2020, the company spent $19M on S&M and acquired ~800 patients while losing ~300 to disenrollment, which equates to a CAC of ~$24,000. InnovAge has been described by seasoned PACE experts and equity analysts alike as a "growth machine" due to their rapid growth and aggressive marketing tactics. At IPO in March 2021, InnovAge was trading at a $3.2B market cap for just 6,600 patients under management.

Towards the end of 2021, CMS issued 2 enrollment suspension sanctions against 2 centers in Sacramento and Colorado related to a failure to provide adequate care to patients 24/7/365 and fully staff the IDTs at each site. During the enrollment sanctions, InnovAge will lose ~$7M in revenue over the next 6 to 12 months across Sacramento and Colorado centers. InnovAge's Corrective Action Plan for the Sacramento center has already been accepted by the state and CMS, but the sanctions in Colorado, InnovaAge's largest center, will not be lifted for at least another 6 months. Investors has reacted strongly to these audits and and its market cap has decreased to ~$840M today (down ~75% LTM). Our diligence with close stakeholders suggests that InnovAge struggled with compliance due to not possessing sufficiently comprehensive clinical CRM capabilities to adequately manage their member population. Today, by all accounts, InnovAge is utilizing its rich policy connections and strong balance sheet to continue its rapid growth with a new and renewed internal focus.

**ConcertoCare:** ConcertoCare is a tech-enabled healthcare provider focused on in-home care with three programs with differing levels of high-touch care: Concertro Care Partners (care coordination for in-home care), In-home Primary Care Provider, and PACE. Concerto has evolved out of its previous patient-centered medical home business to deliver primary care support services to manage complex patient populations. ConcertoCare has raised >$150M to-date and is expanding its PACE footprint in 2022 in CA and VA. Concerto leverages its experience in global-risk payment models, its experienced clinical and social worker teams, and technology (Patient 3D platform) to succeed in the PACE market.

**WelbeHealth:** WelbeHealth was founded in 2015 and currently has 4 centers across the coast of CA in Stockton (2019 opening), Fresno (2020 opening), Pasadena (2019), and Long Beach (2020). The company has raised ~$175-225M to-date, and most recently we heard that General Atlantic valued Welbe at $1B (Q4-21). In 2019, the company was generating $6.9M of top line revenue. Today, the company is serving 700-750 members with top-line revenues of ~$70M. Each of the 4 centers Welbe has today are ramping towards the average census of 300-350 over a 4-5 year period, with the Stockton location currently with a census of 275.

**Edenbridge:** Edenbridge was founded in 2016 by a Boston geriatrician who was inspired by his experiences working with elders in non-profit PACE organizations. The company has 4 centers enrolling patients today or planned to open in 2023. Edenbridge is the program manager for two PACE programs for ConcertoCare owned centers - Cherry Blossom PACE (opened in 2021) and another PACE program that is schedule to open in mid-2022 in California. It is also planning on opening 2 more clinics with Element Care, a non-profit PACE operator in MA. Edenbridge was selected to open a third center in Washington D.C. that is scheduled to open in Q3 2022 with Element Care, non-profit PACE organization, as its lead partner. In 2023, Edenbridge plans to open a fourth center, in partnership with Element Care and 2Life Communities, in Boston.

## Financing
The current financing round gives Xin firepower to develop a GTM plan, submit its application, and identify a site for its PACE clinic. The sprint over the next 6-9 months is to match application deadlines and timelines from local, state and federal bodies, and not necessarily because of an impending cash cliff. Over the next 6-9 months, the key areas of spend for the company will be on bringing on key leadership members to parent organization, applications and licenses, and consulting fees. The first key hires to support the co-founders will be a PACE network expert and a medical director. The team has already identified PACE experts with experience and connections in the space that will be vital in shepherding through a successful application. For a potential medical director, the team is looking for a hospitalist, internal medicine doctor, or gerontologist with experience caring for a PACE or similar population. The goal of the subsequent $15M - $20M financing will be to build out the PACE center, hire the team, and begin to enroll patients in January 2024. In conversations with downstream investors, progress over the next 6-9 months as laid out in the timeline can trigger a larger capital injection.

Financial projections assume Xin can enroll a census of 400 patients at year 3, and maintain that rate over the subsequent years in 1 clinic. 195 patients in year 1 would generate $11.3M in capitated revenue, an average PMPY of $57,860. A majority of OpEx spend is for contracted providers to provide outside services, including in-home services, pharmacy, medical specialists, inpatient, and dialysis. Similar to InnovAge, the company is expecting about 2/3 of total medical spend to come from contracted providers and 1/3 from internal salaried employees. The contribution margin for this clinic conservatively ranges from 25% - 30% compared to the 35+% contribution margins InnovAge has demonstrated in its most mature centers. Rent for the PACE center will likely range from $300K - $400K, while marketing expenses are relatively low compared to industry averages mentioned above (e.g., InnovAge's high CAC). EBITDA margins are projected to range from 17%-18% compared to the industry average of closer to 10%-12%. Although aggressive, its a recognition of the increased operating leverage with a vertically integrated, tech-forward clinic. In addition to the operating expenses listed below, other major expenditures affecting cash flow and liquidity include building improvements, vans and transportation, and CMS Fiscal Soundness/Risk Reserve Estimate.

*   **Building improvements:** ~$1.3M in year 1 and $250K in subsequent years to convert an existing facility to PACE standards and maintain quality over time
*   **Vans and transportation:** Scaling with patient population from $225K in the initial years to $600-$700K over years 3 and 4
*   **CMS Fiscal Soundness / Risk Reserve Estimate:** Xin must maintain capital reserves of an estimated $5M in years 2 and beyond to demonstrate to CMS they have a fiscally sound operation.

Building a de-novo PACE clinic is capital intensive. We wanted to get in an as early as possible with a strong founding team to establish ownership and recognize an important valuation inflection point in the company's trajectory. Looking at comparable for-profit PACE builds, Xin has to raise a total of $20M-$30M to begin to enroll patients. This initial seed round will serve to develop a GTM plan, bring on key team members, and identify a site. The subsequent Series A will enable the company to begin to enroll patients in 1 center. A larger Series B and Series C would enable expansion throughout CA and potentially to the other 31 states that currently offer PACE. In the conservative scenario below, we assume high dilution to account for the capital intensive nature of a PACE build, account for dilution for employee options grants, and any additional bridge financing that might be required because of delays in the application / licensing period. Assuming a $1M investment in the Series A to protect ownership, Virtue can generate favorable returns even with additional dilution in subsequent rounds.

## Summary: Areas of strength / Key Risks

### Areas of strength:
*   **Founding team:** As mentioned above, Xing and Yang are one of the most outstanding management teams we have engaged over the last 5+ years. These twin brothers are on a mission to transform senior care after their past successes in enterprise tech. Xin and Yang initially explored building an analytics and technology platform to sell to PACE clinics, but decided they would need to build a full-stack PACE model to truly move the needle and enable the next-generation of PACE. It takes a special team to make the decision to commit to the daunting task of building a de-novo PACE clinic.
*   **Market dynamics:** Building a de-novo PACE clinic is a complex regulatory process that takes 2-3 years, but the reward for successful implementation is the highest PMPY ($70K - $100K) in health care, robust EBITDA margins (15%), and concrete defensibility. Xin is entering the PACE market at an important inflection point for growth. For-profit PACE clinics have developed a model for growth, and pushed key regulatory changes and impending legislative changes to expand access to PACE.
*   **PACE derivatives:** If Xin can prove out its care model in the sickest and frailest dual-eligible populations in the country, it can utilize this clinical chassis, internal know-how, and technology to platform to extend into other areas of at-home and community care. The company can more easily “flex down” to Medicare Advantage (including SNPs), risk-based medical groups, and other risk-based arrangements with institutional care facilities.

### Risks:
*   **Inexperienced team:** While the team's previous experience is incredibly impressive, neither of the founders have healthcare experience. PACE represents one of the most complex regulatory and clinical model imaginable, even for those with experience across healthcare delivery services. The complexity of PACE and regulatory requirements create known but sometimes uncontrollable risks. Missing an application window, failing a readiness review, or failing a state audit could slow down launch by years and burn millions of dollars. Xin will be laser-focused over the next 2-3 months to recruit PACE and medical directors to complement the founders operational capacity.
*   **Timeline and capital intensity:** Based on comparable for-profit companies in the space, Xin will have to raise $100M+ to enroll 1,000+ patients. For a fund of our size, this has the potential to severely dilute our ownership without the ability to protect our pro-rata in subsequent rounds.
*   **Economic Recession / Downturn:** Any form of material economic downturn, or outright recession, may adversely affect Xin given the capital intensive requirements to the business. Furthermore, it is unclear what impact a recession or any type of negative economic environment will have on the continued funding and overall support for the PACE program.
