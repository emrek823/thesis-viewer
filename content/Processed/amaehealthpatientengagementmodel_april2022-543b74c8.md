# Amae Health Patient Engagement and Treatment Model

## Phase

### 1. Engage
**Day 0**
We work with health systems to make our staff readily available to connect with patients at the hospital, prior to discharge. An Amae Engager, who is stationed at the hospital, meets the patient with kindness and approachability. They introduce them to the Amae program, receive their consent to their medical records and treatment, and fill out our patient member dashboard, collecting treatment and social determinant's of health (SDOH) information.

### 2. Stabilize
**Day 1 - 7**
Led by an Amae psychiatrist, a Health Coach conducts in person visits to the Amae Member and sets up initial clinical appointments, including transportation. A Case Coordinator supports SDOH services including housing, nutrition and social engagement. A personalized stability plan is created that involves family members and social support, along with a comprehensive care program for continued medical evaluations and check-ins, monitoring and support across SDoH.

### 3. Recover
**Day 8 - 21+**
Amae Member continues to be treated; evaluated for medication side effects; engaged in their care program. They expand upon both their clinical treatment and SDoH treatment, with added education and employment support.

### 4. Prosper
**Day 22 - 30 and throughout maintenance phase**
Amae Member works to implement their prosperity plan through setting goals and key milestones in partnership with their peer mentor and clinical care team. Once met, they remain engaged with Amae on an as-needed basis via our hybrid approach.
