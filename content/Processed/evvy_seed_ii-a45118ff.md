## Summary
Evvy is building a platform to bring personalized medicine at scale to all women, starting with generating insights around the vaginal microbiome. The company is building a consumer-facing brand that women love, developing sophisticated proprietary bioinformatics for the vaginal microbiome, and validating clinical pathways to close the loop on care. This approach has the potential to transform care for women in an area that has been woefully underserved to-date. With this potential comes complexity in tying together multiple parts of the organization - from product to science to clinical - to maintain scientific and clinical validity while reaching the scale necessary to make a transformative impact. Raising an additional $1.5M - $2M in capital today will give Evvy additional runway to ensure the company hits key milestones to raise a strong Series A in the next ~12 months. These key milestones include launching a care delivery arm to improve member retention and gross margins, reaching a $2M= run-rate, securing B2B partnerships with life science corporates, and continuing to validate its internal data and insights engine. This Seed-II investment gives us the potential to secure additional allocation in a high performing portfolio company, double down on our winners, and secure favorable pricing based on projected Series A milestones and future valuation inflection points.

Virtue is investing $925K in a SAFE at $45M cap (10% discount) in a minimum total round of $1M, with the option for the company to raise up to $2M. This investment would bring our total ownership to XX%.

## Scientific Validation
When the genome of a human patient with an undiagnosed clinical disorder is sent for sequencing, the typical procedure is to generate sufficient raw read data to compare the patient's genome to a standard human reference and look for differences that may be pathogenic and clinically relevant. Reference genomes for human genetics have improved rapidly since the human genome project (HGP) in the early 2000's, and the reference genome has been continuously improved over the last few decades by the Genome Reference Consortium (GRC).

For the vaginal microbiome, high-quality reference datasets are almost nonexistent. While multiple 16S rRNA gene catalogs exist, there are relatively few curated resources for referencing metagenomes and metatranscriptomes. Academic efforts, such as VIRGO from the University of Maryland, have analyzed ~1,500 vaginal metagenomes. Evvy already has >3,000 users on its platform. This scale and access to high-quality metagenomic data gives the company the ability to use its proprietary reference dataset as the de-facto standard for the industry.

The process of building and validation this proprietary reference data and bioinformatics workflow will evolve over the next 9-12 months as the company gathers deeper insights. The company can move from identifying species and strains (e.g., going beyond 16s to better understand diversity) to discovering SNPs (e.g., correlating mutations with BV recurrence) of interest, to understanding function (e.g., understanding metabolites produced from biofilm forming genes). The first step that is on track to be completed this summer is to develop proprietary metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs). For comparison, MAGs in the gut microbiome enabled researchers to understand 50% of previously uncharacterized microbes.

## Clinical Validation
Evvy is currently running an IRB-approved pilot study in ~50 patients over 6 months to evaluate the efficacy of a novel platform that improves vaginal microbiome compositions, patient experience, and health outcomes through accurately matching people to the care they need. Although BV has been studied for decades, a gap in knowledge still exists in characterizing BV infections. Current characterizations of vaginitis are insufficient and do not provide a roadmap for a more holistic approach and treatments that addresses BV infections and helps to prevent recurrence. The study will incorporate a comprehensive approach to BV infections using “whole person” characteristics, including microbial composition, symptoms, behaviors, and demographics. The overarching hypothesis is that by offering existing treatments in a specialized timeline with educational resources will reduce the rate of BV recurrence.

Ultimately, Evvy's goal is to provide women with recommendations for treatment based on how other women with similar microbial composition, symptoms, behaviors, and demographics have responded to similar treatment regimens. With in-vitro diagnostics, there the specificity of the recommendation can range from 23andMe (e.g., informational) to Foundation Medicine (e.g., clinical decision support for an oncologist). With this capital, Evvy is looking to find the “goldilocks zone” where they can close the loop of care by empowering women and their providers with information to stage and triage currently available generic drugs without becoming too prescriptive.

As demonstrated below, Evvy's general approach is to run clinical studies (IRB-approved or with their own consumer base) to understand which archetypes of women respond to which drugs. For example, in the first clinical study Evvy may find that women with a BMI <30, who are sexually active, with a specific strain of Gardanella, and have had >2 recurrences of BV over the last year, might respond better to intravaignal metronidazole vs. oral for 1L treatment. This group of “responders” provides a basis to reccomend (without prescribing) this treatment to other similar women. Over time, this portion of responders will increase until they have a large enough percentage of the demographic to scale to 10,000+ patients and cement themselves as a “must-have" for a larger portion of patients beyond the early adopters.

### Bar Chart: Dollars ($M) / Deaths (2012-2022)
*Chart Description: A stacked bar chart showing total "Dollars ($M) / Deaths" on the Y-axis (scale 0-40,000) for years 2012 through 2022 on the X-axis. Each year's bar is composed of multiple colored segments, indicating different categories of spending or deaths. The overall trend shows a gradual increase in total value from 2012 to 2019/2020, with a notable peak around 2020-2021, followed by a slight decrease in 2022. Due to the lack of labels for individual segments within each stacked bar and the low resolution, precise extraction of values for each category per year is not feasible. However, the total approximate values appear to be:*

| Year | Approximate Total Value (Dollars $M / Deaths) |
| :--- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| 2012 | ~4,000                                        |

*   GSK next program
*   Labcorp

### Care delivery
*   margins
*   dataset
*   retention

Individual gene association vs. acute and chronic
Samples themselves beyond the taxonomy data
*   Biobanking with Columbia
Ferring - how many samples do you have that represent this
Mayo - biomarker discovery
LabCorp - how can we co-develop clinical and scalable platform through clincan network?
GSK - co-development
