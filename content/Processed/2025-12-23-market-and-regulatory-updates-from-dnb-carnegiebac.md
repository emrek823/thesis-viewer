### *Political Economy Update – Markets, Policy and Deal Activity*

Vital Signs is an overview of the current macroeconomic environment in the US healthcare markets, including policy and regulatory updates, the current administration's overhaul of US healthcare policies and their impact on the life sciences ecosystem.

Our investment and corporate banking teams examine healthcare market activity and how these factors influence deal-making in both the US and Europe.

Given the current market dynamics, DNB//Back Bay will publish frequent updates to note changes in the regulatory and deal environment.

In November 2025, we look at key regulatory and deal updates since Vital Signs was released in June 2025.
