## Slide 10

Scope: 
We will take on the moderate and severe SMI patients (schizophrenia, bipolar, MDD and BPD) in payor’s membership 
We aim to launch in target markets with a substantial volume of patient population, and expand across the broader market over the term of the contract

 Typical Performance Based Value Sharing:
Year 1: Bundled payment per engaged member / launch as an in-network provider with SLA’s
+ Year 2: Year 1 + gain share with value split 75% payor / 25% Amae 
+ Year 3: Year 2 + with 50% payor / 50% Amae upside and downside risk, with downside risk capped at fees
+ Year 4 onward: Amae will take full risk on engaged patient lives
We will calculate savings by baselining historic cost and performance on the patient population with at least 2 years worth of historical claims, and compare to Amae’s results

Terms: 
One-time launch fee to support implementation of core operations
After Year 1, Amae credits fees against savings generated to ensure that if we do not generate savings for our payor partners greater than the value of our fees, we credit the difference back

Partnership Terms

Amae Health aims to take downside risk over the course of 12-24 months

Appendix

## Slide 13

First, we take a high-touch approach to initial engagement

Engage patient at the ED

Pre-discharge, an onsite Amae Engager (LCSW & Peer Mentor) meets with the patient at the ED and onboards them into our community

Onboard and set up a care plan 

We create an account for the patient, set up their care dashboard, receive consents and intake medical records to pair with claims data

Care coordinator & health coach matching
 
Patient is matched with based on cultural competency, preferences, presenting symptoms, and medical history

Housing facilitation and security
 
If needed, a living arrangement is provided based on their existing status and living conditions (eg. home-attendant for suicidal patient living alone)

Telepsychiatry evaluation

When a psychiatrist is not available during a patient’s hospitalization, we provide a telepsychiatry evaluation to expedite discharge

We intervene at a critical behavior change point and build trust through dedicated support for a patient’s immediate needs

---

## Slide 14

With a psychiatry-led model, we establish personalized treatment plans for patients’ behavioral health, physical health and social health needs to vastly improve outcomes compared to existing solutions

Next, we provide delivery of holistic care

NP / GP

Medication Management

Psychologist

Support System

Housing

Community + Holistic Health

Psychiatrist and the nurse practitioner / general physician work together to evaluate and establish a personalized medication and treatment plan including SUD treatment, comorbidity treatments, and medication side effect monitoring

Health coach and case coordinator (LCSW) acts as our patients’ health “quarterbacks” and help address critical social determinants of health including but not limited to: housing, food security, sleep, exercise, mindfulness, support system engagement, community integration

## Slide 15

Over the long term, our patients advance from acute 
illness to prosperity planning

Amae Patient is assigned an Amae Peer Mentor – an individual with SMI experience whom the patient can relate to and build trust with based on their condition
Peer mentor supports patient in completing their Amae Prosperity Pact – a set of measurable aims to re-establish meaning and purpose in a patient’s life
Amae Patient will also be responsible for engaging in local community service efforts and volunteering in order to feel that they are contributing to their community and helping others

## Slide 16

A technology enabled hybrid model that meets patients where they are

Hybrid Care: Flexibility in engaging the patient how and when it makes the most sense

Amae Care Center

An inclusive combined community center and outpatient clinical facility built / leased by Amae that provides education, mentorship, and social support in tandem with a healthcare center for clinical work

Option for temporary housing and respite care onsite as an emergency stopgap to build trust and prevent unnecessary hospitalizations

Amae Digital Patient Platform

A single platform and EHR that:
Integrates remote monitoring including
assessments and adherence tracking
Syncs data from digital health devices
Presents meaningful data summary to clinicians and providers
Enables personalized treatment planning and task management
Video + asynchronous treatment

---

## Slide 17

Flipping the treatment model to treat SMI as the primary condition

A psychiatrist serves as the lead clinician for our patients

Taking on treatment costs for patients with the highest needs

Delivering innovative care to have transformational outcomes

We improve outcomes by first treating the SMI

We use more invasive yet effective and higher ROI treatments
Long-acting injectables, Clozapine, IV Ketamine, TMS
We address SMI-specific SDOH:
Substance abuse treatment, housing, employment, food security

Health outcomes are primarily driven by patients’ undertreated SMI - physical health comorbidities cannot be managed until the SMI is treated

Through integrating leading treatment modalities within our approach, we can deliver lasting change

---

## Slide 18

Amae’s intensive specialty disease focused model incorporates high clinical intervention and SDoH. For medicaid plans, improving HEDIS scores can lead to winning additional member base and growing revenue

Amae helps with health risk-adjustments as SMI patients often have undiagnosed conditions

Value proposition for our partners

Very poor outcomes for growing SMI population

Pain Points

Amae Health Solution

Extremely high cost population

Inability to engage with population

Improperly coded patients

Lack of health equity solutions

Inability to pass on risk from patients to providers

Amae reduces frequent ER hospitalizations and reduces total cost of care from chronic health problems (diabetes, hypertension, SUD)

Amae engages patients in-person after a hospitalization event and introduces behavior change, trust building, and life management to support high level of initial engagement. Amae’s care centers provide a clinical and social setting to maintain the engagement

Amae helps plans achieve health equity goals by providing high quality care to disproportionately impoverished and disadvantaged patients

Amae assumes risk for SMI patients over time and works with payors to align incentives with our high outcome and cost reducing clinical model

Amae’s solution is all-inclusive for SMI Patients Clinical and SDoH Needs

## Slide 20

Measurement-based methodologies to understand complex human behavior are increasingly more available

There is a huge catalog of well validated assessments to measure relevant aspects of human behavior and characteristics

Genetics is starting to develop a deep catalog of variants correlated with complex human characteristics and will continue to grow to include phenotypes related to treatment response

Digital health technology and wearables acquire a massive amount of data related to sleep, physical activity, and social behavior

Artificial Intelligence aims to use the massive quantity of data to shift prediction from populations to individuals

Initial treatment planning: Population level evidence will be used to classify individuals based on genetics, biomarkers, demographics and baseline assessments to predict and refine an initial treatment plan

Adjunct treatment monitoring: Ongoing ‘real-time’ measurements can be used to inform adjustments to treatment

Wellness-monitoring: Continuous post-treatment measurement-based monitoring (activity, social interactions, sleep, biomarkers) can identify early evidence of symptom worsening and enable early interventions

Increasing role for measurement-based care in mental health treatment

The ways to measure complex human behavior are exploding

Research provided by Dr. Scott Fears, CMO Amae Health

---

## Slide 21

Future of leveraging measurement and data to enable precision medicine

Conventional psychiatric approach assigns a one-size-fits-all plan based predominantly on a diagnostic category

An alternative approach is to use measurement-based methods to: 
Define symptom targets
Predict optimal treatment plan
Monitor and adjust treatment course
Maintain wellness

Enabling focused and tailored treatment

Conventional vs. Alternative Approach

Research provided by Dr. Scott Fears, CMO Amae Health

## Slide 22

We allow our providers to make a real impact on low-income patients lives 
Enables them to have meaningful time and engagement with patients, while incentivizing them to have patients’ outcomes top of mind

Provider hiring strategy: Addressing the supply and demand issue

Recruit passionate clinicians and LCSW’s from FQHC’s, City hospitals, Department of Public Health 
Provide mission-driven clinicians and providers a place where they can take care of the severely ill and impoverished populations, and fulfilling their clinical goals and dreams

Amae Health’s clinical model will be advantageous in the recruitment and retention of clinical staff
