**Client**
Hi. Thanks for taking the time to talk with me. I am interested in learning more about some of these bill or chart review platforms in healthcare, medical chart review platforms. One of which is Charta Health, which we understand you are a customer of at PAM Health. Love to just ask you evaluating a tool like Charta, bringing Charta on board and then initial experience within platform as well. I think a great kicking-off point would be, if you wouldn't mind very briefly just chatting about what your current role is and how that relates to Charta Health.

**Expert**
In terms of the current role, in addition to what I would say our future-forward innovations, I do oversee some ambulatory networks. Within the ambulatory networks, we do have services that are outpatient and hospital-based outpatient departments that benefit from a solution like Charta.

**Client**
Part of it is trying to understand the personas that Charta sells into. Your title, just to confirm, is the senior vice president of innovation at PAM Health?

**Expert**
That's correct. Typically, what they're looking for, they're looking for folks that are going to have influence and decision-making within the scope of the provider side. For us, on the provider side, it's going to be our ambulatory services. We do have inpatient services, but it's the ambulatory services that have the high-encounter count that benefit from the tool and the solution that Charta has.

**Client**
Okay. Can you just explain a little bit your mandate or remit for the innovation group? Is it to look for start-ups to bring into the ecosystem? Is it to look at specifically technology? Just give us a sense of what you are focused on at your group.

**Expert**
What we look at is, how do we develop synergistic core services that tuck into our existing primary services? We have a great post-acute network of inpatient, long-term acute and inpatient rehab capabilities. What are those other capabilities that are synergistic to what we do that are downstream that will get us from when the patient discharges from the inpatient side to get to home? How do we build up those services between inpatient to home that we can not only maintain the continuity of the patient within our capability, but how do we plug that in and further diversify our revenue streams? That's in summary.

**Client**
Okay. Charta Health is obviously an earlier stage start-up. Is part of your remit in your role to be constantly chatting with these start-up companies, test them, eval them, and then figure out a way to plug them into the broader organization?

**Expert**
Yeah. If you think about the different innovation approaches, I like to do the pilot-and-scale approach. We pilot. We assess it. We determine what's the applicability, the utility of it, and we can scale. That's typically what we will do, whether it's an early stage or even a mature organization. When organizations are looking to develop services within our portfolio, we want to assure, one, that we can actually assess in a control setting the value of what this solution will bring, and does it have applicability if we were to try and scale it across the country or even regionally?

We typically tend to pilot these endeavors in a market that will allow us to have enough scale to be able to see whether it's living up to its promises and that we can actually test it in multiple platforms, not only inpatient but also through the outpatient continuum.

**Client**
Okay, that's helpful. You mentioned, just in terms of the lay of the land of your entity, that you guys have ambulatory and inpatient. Could you just give us a quick overview of the scale of the organization and the different service lines? Do you guys have hospitals? How many? How many clinics or post-acute clinics do you have? Just a rough lay of the land would be helpful.

**Expert**
Roughly, we're 100 access sites. What does that mean? That's about 80 hospitals, six to eight de novos a year. We have behavioral health hospitals. We also have 40 outpatient ambulatory centers. In addition, we have infusion. We also have home health in two states. That should give you a sense of the scope and scale. We're in 23 states. We're privately held. We're leveraged only one time. We have superior resources and credit facility to support our prospective and contemplated ventures, and we utilize retained earnings to do our acquisitions.

**Client**
Got it. Of the patient population that you see across all of these 100 or so access points, what is the rough breakdown of the payers between, let's say, commercial Medicare and Medicaid? A rough estimate would be helpful.

**Expert**
Given that we have multiple lines of business, if you're looking at rehab, it's roughly greater than 65% Medicare. The balance would be Medicare Advantage and then some commercial plans. Medicaid is very small. On the long-term acute side, it's roughly 50/50, 50% Medicare, 50% Medicare Advantage plans. On the ambulatory side, it's roughly 60% Medicare and then about 30% commercial and balanced Medicare Advantage.

**Client**
Okay, super helpful. Would you mind just explaining at a high level in your own words, what is Charta Health?

**Expert**
From my perspective, Charta Health is a solution that allows us to assess completely on the front-end, and that's how I look at it, the pre-bill and the billing cycle which does lend to revenue cycle. Quite frankly, I think its best utility is assessing the integrity of the claim that's going out before it goes out. That way you pre-identify the issues prior to the release of the claim to the clearinghouses.

What do you do? You mitigate denials, you mitigate delays in cash flow, which inevitably do improve your revenue cycle. I think in the simplest terms, it helps you ensure that your claim is as clean and as accurate as it can be prior to it being transmitted to the clearinghouse.

**Client**
Okay, that's super clear and super helpful. If you were to break out the most common issues that would lead to an unclean claim, so to speak, what would those main categories be and how well does Charta address each of those main issues historically?

**Expert**
I think really when you think about what delays a claim, it's typically issues related to the rules related to a particular plan. What does that mean? If you think about when you're in a market and say if you're in one market and you have 30 different plant types and ensuring that the rules within those plan types are properly addressed within the algorithm, and then being able to take that type of look in a different market that has different plans and that we'll have to have different rules.

At a high level, the kind of things that I see are really things that you can only identify when you're looking at 100% of your claims. Most organizations audit a percentage of claims, and then when a claim comes back with a denial, they work it. Imagine being able to look at 100% of your claims before you send out and then identifying early on, "Oh, this is something that pops up. It's a modifier. It's a limit modifier on physical therapy encounters," and then understanding really quick how you can make that adjustment and then address it on scale.

I think a lot of the errors that it identifies are really processes that we would not have seen. We just typically submitted the claim and then we would have to work it out on the backend. When you're working it out on the backend, guess what? That's labor, that's delay, that's cash flow. Typically, it's the appropriate rules to a particular plan in a particular market and understanding the appropriate constraints and limitations for that plan for those diagnostic codes.

**Client**
Okay, super helpful. I'm just trying to understand the baseline set of tools and operating processes that organizations had access to. You said one thing that was interesting. You said typically, people would just evaluate a sample. They wouldn't look at 100% of claims. You would audit a percentage of claims. Give us a sense, what percentage would you typically audit?

**Expert**
That's a good question. It really just depends on how you're seeing your claims and your denials coming back. If you're seeing denials on X modifiers on the therapy side, then you're probably increasing your audit levels on those types of claims. You should broadly do reviews on EOBs regularly. Each organization has whatever their litmus test is, but that's pretty standard industry-wise. Our tolerance may be different than others.

**Client**
What was the number again? I missed it.

**Expert**
I didn't give a precise number of what that percentage is. I think from our perspective, we feel that's some of our business integrity. What I will tell you is that all organizations audit claims. They will audit a higher percentage of claims that they see that they have issues with. We have a standard that we look at. When we look at new issues that arise, we'd probably audit more of those to make sure our fixes are resolving it.

**Client**
Okay. That's really helpful. For the folks that are actually working on the coding, preparing the codes and getting ready, I don't even know the right terminology, but before you have to submit to the clearinghouses, I assume those are the billers and coders, probably first the billers and then the coders. What you're describing is really complicated, multiple geographies. Within each geography, there could be, you said, 30 different plans.

How are these people figuring out what is right? What technology do they have? Any detail you could provide on how long it actually takes to prepare something to be submitted would be helpful because it just seems like it's so complex. Not being in the industry, I'm struggling to understand how anyone does it.

**Expert**
One thing that I can tell you there are certain episodes of care that you can only bill, say, once a month. You do one billing once a month. It could be 30 encounters on that one billing. There are other bill types that you drop maybe once a week or as needed per encounter.

I think the bigger issue is if you think about a distributed network that's geographically dispersed, and each of those facilities has individuals that have skill sets and responsibilities for making sure that every superbill, every UB, whatever the case may be, is accurate before it's sent out. There's a lot of human labor in that. There's a lot of what I would argue, your charge masters aligning with your billing cycle.

Things that you do on Friday may not be billed until Monday in those types of environments, but having your routine and making sure that you have very solid targets because if you think about, If you have a delay in billings getting to submitted, that will downstream affect your cash flow. We're very diligent to make sure that we hit our billing metrics and that encounters are billed within 24 hours that can be submitted daily. Again, others, like therapy, those encounters usually get dropped once a month. That might be because that's a CMS expectation as opposed to a health plan's expectations.

**Client**
With the prior paradigm of having a subset of folks reviewing a small subset of your total claims getting sent out, if you could quantify, what were the things that were breaking? What was the denial rate? Did you have a sense you were leaving a ton of revenue on the table? If you're able to quantify any of that prior to Charta.

**Expert**
We wouldn't have looked at Charta if we thought we were getting all our revenue and we weren't having denials. I think the short answer is we felt that there was opportunity there. We felt that in order to validate what we thought the opportunity was, we needed to see some solutions that were very focused on this area.

Let's say if we were seeing a denial rate of 13% for a certain encounter type and we were able to 100% review, make those adjustments, change some of the rules within the EMR system and the billing software to make sure it allocated for what we were missing, you could potentially see for that encounter, instead of it being a 12% or 13% denial, maybe now it's a 3%. 3% based on how many numbers of claims?

I look at the aggregate. If you're submitting 100,000 claims and you have an error rate of 3%, what does that look like in terms of dollars? If you have 100,000 claims and they're 13%, what does that look like? You have to look at it in the aggregate. If you're looking at it just a small amount of claims, it may not make a lot of sense, but when you're looking at an aggregate over multiple states, all of a sudden, it has a different level of scale.

**Client**
Yep. Let's say in this example of going from 12% or 13% to 3%, the 3% that you can't prevent even with a Charta, what is that actually due to?

**Expert**
That could be a lot of things where the patient's plan type is different or they have a third-party broker that's handling the administrative process. Even though it says it's a Cigna plan and the person's carrying a card that says HealthSpring, it might be someone else who's actually adjudicating the claim. You don't know that sometimes because you don't know that Cigna outsourced certain claims adjudication to somebody else until it happens.

**Client**
Got it. The denial rate is a clear metric that you can monitor. You can see obviously at 12%, 13%, that's no good and you need to change something there. In terms of the missed coding opportunities or the revenue opportunity, is that more of a general feeling in the industry even, that everyone knows they're leaving money on the table? Is it something that you were able to quantify or just knew more specifically?

**Expert**
No, I think it's not so much that we thought there was something missed. One of the things you could look at a health plan in a market and it's say, "We cover these codes," great. The other one says, "We cover these codes," but how those codes are entered, one code might have to come first versus the other. I'll give you a great example. If you have a patient who has a 60 cm. wound, there's a couple codes you have to use.

One will be a 11042 for the first 20 cm. You'd have to use two codes of 11045 because that's the additional 40 cm. If you were to code first the 11045 and the 11042, if you reversed it, even though it still covers 60 cm., the problem is they're not in the right order. This is where human error comes in because there's someone transcribing what was done procedurally and then those procedures getting coded correctly onto the superbill.

Sometimes, it's the order ranking of the codes. It's not that anything was done wrong, other than one code was supposed to go first. The payer's not going to fix that for you. Guess what? They're going to kick it back to you that the claim is denied. It's going to give you codes as to why it's denied.

**Client**
I wish you were in the room with us because we were just gaping at each other. Again, the complexity level here is insane. Not only do you have to figure out the right code, given the right plan and other details, but there's also a sequencing that matters when there's multiple codes. I just go back to my earlier question. Either everyone who's doing billing and coding is an expert and has all this stuff memorized. What tools do they currently have in place to help them do this? Is it more of a philosophy of 80% of codes are more standard, so it's not this complex and just a smaller percentage, you might have to kick it to an expert or something like that? Give us a sense of that dynamic.

**Expert**
I think on the inpatient side, it's very straightforward because you're either getting paid on a DRG or CMG or you're getting a per diem. It's pretty straightforward what it can look like. I think on the ambulatory and the provider side, it is very complex. To your point, there is a sequencing issue. There is also, one may pay a percent of billed charge. One may pay per encounter. One may pay a grouping of procedures to equal a net.

Your contracts and your contract management systems have to be very good. One of the reasons providers and small physician groups and stuff have so many challenges goes back to the capabilities of their practices to be able to be this thorough. That's why they'll go to an Athena or a Privia and some of these other places to try and get the help that they need.

If you think about from their side, what is the margin that they're paying someone to do their billing? It could be up to 6% for every bill. I've met with the founder of Charta and really sat with him to understand, "What made you decide to get into a healthcare solution, given that you don't have any healthcare experience?" I think he coined it perfectly to me. He goes, "I was looking for areas that I thought were opportunistic that had lots of problems and they needed someone to help make it better. They needed a solution."

He goes, "I know I can put solutions together, but I needed to understand how could I solve for X?" He saw healthcare had a lot of problems. He heard a lot of folks talk about the problems that they had. He dug in and said, "What can I do? What can I develop to solve a problem?" That's how they came up with it.

**Client**
Could I ask you a question? If you as an entity choose to outsource your coding and billing process, that outsourced service provider, if they submit a claim that has errors on it and gets denied, do they have to handle that? Where does that burden fall?

**Expert**
Now, let's say you outsource your claims to somebody else, to a third party. They will give it probably one or two attempts. After certain attempts, after certain time frames, then it becomes aged AR bad debt. You're taking contractual adjustments or adjustments on your P&L. If we are owed dollars on a claim, we're going to pursue it. I'm not talking patient responsibility type.

What I'm talking about is more so that the health plan is denying for a rationale that is solvable and that we can rebuild it and we meet timely filing deadlines. We're going to pursue it. I think the challenge is, as many health plans, it's so complicated that those delays cause you to start aggregating a lot of aging AR in 30-, 60-, 90-day buckets. A lot of organizations stop pursuing at a certain time frame.

You could be holding hundreds of thousands of dollars at a 90-day-plus aging bucket. Are you going to write down then your past adjustments when you should expect to see some of those dollars back? You have to have a better grind to be able to pursue those dollars. I think that's where we're challenged. There are many times that payers, they have so many products out there that sometimes they can't keep which contract falls into which product because it's complicated on their end.

If they're only owing you $100 and they're saying, "This plan type is this product. It only pays $80," but then everything you have says, "No, it says it's this plan," you could be going back and forth with them for a little bit and then guess what? You ultimately get your $100, but maybe it took six months. How much human resource utilization did it take for you to get the $20 difference?

**Client**
Yep. Going back to something that you were talking about earlier around the two quantifiable metrics that you can take a look at to understand Charta is making an impact, a positive impact hopefully, to the business, one was the denial rate. Obviously, it depends, but what would you say is, if you know, the industry average and what would best in class be?

**Expert**
I think you want to be below double digits. You want to be, I would argue, somewhere between 4% and 6%. There are certain specialty claim types, high utilization, high cost services that you could be in the low teens. That may be acceptable for some. If we're providing a service, we did it according to the contract terms, and we got our prioritization approvals, we expect to get paid.

**Client**
Okay. With Charta, when you guys were first chatting with them, did they give an indication of how much of an improvement they could potentially affect using their technology? Just want to get a sense of the magnitude, like a couple of percentage points. Obviously, it depends on where the starting point is. Would love to hear that.

**Expert**
Really for us, it was about we identified the problem we were seeing. We felt that there were problems in certain areas and that it was probably a higher percentage than we think it is. We wanted to be able to try, if we were running 100% of claims pre-review, what would that look like? Really utilizing that as the proof of concept that if you identify a portion of claims before we even send out that we're having errors, that gave us enough pause to say, "We need to look at some other things then as well."

That's where all of a sudden your proof of concept extends into, "Can we also look at this and this?" I think it's more of a journey. It's also developing a relationship with them because to your point, they may be early stage, but they also have to have enough opportunities to review claims at a certain magnitude, to test their assumptions. Their hypothesis may be, "We can get from here to here.," but you need enough, what I would say participants and enough volume to be able to see how much of an improvement can really be had and is this the best tool for that or maybe it's something else.

I think it helped them from the product development side. It also helped us from understanding on the revenue integrity side and the revenue cycle side the opportunities for improvement that we had. I think it's they're learning, we're learning, and we're both taking those learnings to the table to say, "How can we optimize now from what we both discovered?"

**Client**
Take us back to when you originally heard of Charta Health and/or reached out to them. When was that and how did you hear about them?

**Expert**
They weren't called Charta at the time. They were called Limo. I worked with some folks there that had come from other entities that went there because they knew something good was happening there. In essence, the relationship I had with them prior was such that it lent credence and validation that this is something I should want to consider then. The colleague that I have trust in is telling me that this is something that they see benefit with, and then having my own experience and having my own face-to-face.

**Client**
You heard of Limo Health back then because you knew one of their employees or you knew someone in the industry who was a customer?

**Expert**
I knew someone in the industry that was actually going to move over to them because they were so excited about what they were doing.

**Client**
I see. It's a referral of sorts, or it was through existing connection. When was this again?

**Expert**
Correct. It was probably about at least nine months ago. It was before they became Charta and before they got their next funding stream.

**Client**
Understood. Once you originally got connected to them, give us a little bit of the play by play on how it worked in terms of what was the original messaging. Was there a POC? If so, what did that look like? Even talk about what the implementation looked like in terms of effort needed, time spent, etc.

**Expert**
I think really the messaging was that they had a solution capability, that I think the big piece to me was that they could review 100% of your outbound charts as part of the billing process. To me, that was key. The big thing for them was that "If you let us review the charts, that we can actually utilize our AI capability, rapidly recoup, look at the rules, align it we're meeting the person."

To me, that was attractive. It allowed for a couple of intro calls, then a larger call that bring in additional stakeholders. I met with them face to face because I think when you're looking at something like this, sometimes you got to see the person face to face and really see, "Can they do what they claim they can do?"

**Client**
Got it. What did they propose?

**Expert**
We would do a sample run of chart types. I had an idea what the business line I wanted to look at because I think the sequencing for that business line is such that it made sense for me to examine that. It's enough where we could put our arms around it to see what it would inform us of. We did a sample of charts over a period of time and utilized that sample as the proof of concept. "Review this. Now show us what you discovered."

**Client**
How would you characterize the efficacy of that sample run as measured by accuracy or any other metric that we should be aware of, that's important to you?

**Expert**
I think really the sample statistically made sense to what we were going to look at because it was a ripe enough sample in a particular business line in a particular market that would give me great confidence that if they identified something, I could actually litmus test it myself because it was very controlled. Once we got through the business process of making sure that we could do this sample and that it would preserve the integrity of the data and we identified certain things, then I felt comfortable we could do that.

The sample run process, they asked for about four to six weeks to do it because this was going to be something different that they hadn't done in terms of how they looked at it and that they would do this very specific for us because they wanted to see if they could definitely prove what their software solution states can be done. They met their test.

**Client**
Give us a sense how big was the sample. Are we talking about hundreds of charts, thousands, sub-hundred?

**Expert**
Hundreds of charts that would be a representative statistical sample in a particular market, in a particular line of business to be relevant.

**Client**
Okay. What was the accuracy? Did you find the tool to be fairly accurate? Were there mistakes? What patterns did you see?

**Expert**
I think what we found was that their tool was accurate, that it actually provided some additional insights that we probably were not observing and that we were not observing until it got pushed back. If we looked at their findings and were prospective, utilizing 100% of the review, it could make a material difference. Again, it was a particular line of business in a certain market.

If we extend it to other line of businesses, we'd probably want to do very similar assessments because each line of business has different rules. I think for what we were looking at, it did what we were glad to see. It was very helpful. Now, when you extrapolate that into other services, I think you have to do the same due diligence.

**Client**
Okay, let's see here. By the way, how long did that process take?

**Expert**
Four to six weeks.

**Client**
Okay. After that, what is your current status with Charta Health? Are you now contracted with them? What's the relationship currently?

**Expert**
We're evolving our relationship. That's probably the best I can say, just given the legalities of things.

**Client**
Okay. Hypothetically speaking, if one were to want to go full steam ahead with Charta and if they were an organization similar to yours, how much effort from a process and technology perspective is required to implement the solution?

**Expert**
That's a good question. I think they make it pretty easy in terms of being able to get the data to them. I think how they run on their backend is probably a better question, about how much resource use and how complicated it probably is on their side. I think they make it pretty simple on our side to be able to get the data and format it in such a way that it's usable and can actually deliver results through the various HL7 architecture and interface pieces.

I didn't see that as a barrier or preclusive of being able to scale. I think when you have organizations that are able to develop the architecture that plugs into what you're doing, it's really more of a process of having the appropriate access, the appropriate legal documents in place and ensuring that everyone's protected in that sense.

**Client**
What are the different data sources that you have to integrate Charta Health with to pull from? Is it just your EMR?

**Expert**
The EMR piece and then if there's other components of the EMR. We do have claim software as well. Sometimes, that comes to play, but quite frankly, it's the EMR piece that's probably the most important piece.

**Client**
Got it. Part of what Charta is doing is not only making sure things are coded accurately in terms of the actual services delivered but also making sure that claims will be approved by the payer. They have to have the payer side rule set somehow or they have to have that context. Do they come with that out of the box? Do they have coverage across all the plans and geos that you operate in?

**Expert**
Yeah. What you have to do is obviously you got to be able to provide the plan types, the rules, the things of that nature to help them understand. There is that component, but those managed care contracting experts communicating with the other side of the house of experts, knowing how to ensure that these things are uploaded in a way and that they follow the sequencing and things of that nature. It's no different than our typical revenue cycle piece. In that sense, that piece isn't as difficult as it really sounds. It's more so, the EMR piece is probably the one that's going to identify if even the appropriate keywords are incorporated within the claim.

**Client**
Okay, that's helpful. Other rapid fire questions, if you will, we talked about the metrics. We talked about denials. Those should go down because if you're able to pre-screen 100% of charts before you even hit the clearinghouse and the tool is accurate, that definitely make an impact. Trickier question, if you're willing to answer, based on what you know about Charta, for certain organizations, maybe not yours specifically, just to remove that element out of it, do you see the path for Charta to be able to make a very meaningful impact on certain customer's denial rates? Could it half, like reduced by 50% some of those?

**Expert**
I do think so. I also think that what they've identified is that maybe their biggest impact might be centered on those provider organizations from medical groups, things of that nature that can really benefit from having this type of tool. I think the inpatient side, there's a lot of emphasis on that. There's a lot of folks that do really good in that space. I think on the outpatient side, the ambulatory side, as well as what I would argue the high-volume encounter piece on the provider side, I see that as an opportunity for Charta that they can make a real difference there.

**Client**
Okay. Just to clarify, you said the outpatient. This could be an urgent care. This could be clinic.

**Expert**
If you look at it from the hierarchy of how care is delivered, you have the inpatient side. When you get to the inpatient side and it's all outpatient of whatever the case may be, whether it's a doctor's office, an ambulatory surgery center, a hospital outpatient department, infusion centers, all those non-inside the hospital pieces, I think that is their biggest opportunity. I think that's where the biggest benefit comes from.

**Client**
Okay. Would you say they would also need to have a certain scale, enough volume where Charta could have a big impact? We're trying to define the ideal customer for Charta.

**Expert**
I think if it's a small two-doctor practice, might not have a lot of volume. Many systems have their physician network, that there's enough physician network or ambulatory networks out there. Physical therapy providers, there's a lot of provider-type businesses that will benefit from this.

**Client**
On the inpatient side, I'd love to talk about competition next. This dovetails into that. I've heard of a couple companies. One is called SmarterDx. They were recently acquired by a private equity group called New Mountain Capital. There's also an older company called Indigo. Of course, 3M has some coding, billing modules embedded within their platform. My sense was those were all inpatient-focused. Is that accurate?

**Expert**
SmarterDx is probably more equivalent to a Charta. 3M is an inpatient tool. Many organizations use 3M, but SmarterDx is definitely more equivalent to Charta. I think what's still different about Charta is that their backers are such that they've recognized that there's a lot of utility with where they're focused on. When I think about SmarterDx, to me, I see this more as a flip. I think private equity, they're going to run up the value. They're going to flip it into something different. I don't see them having the strength and capability that I see Charta has.

**Client**
Did you try to use SmarterDx? Were you a customer?

**Expert**
Was not a customer, but did definitely do some due diligence.

**Client**
Okay. Any other competitors in that ilk, Charta, Smarter, that we should be aware of?

**Expert**
I think it's a different audience. Folks will use Novalis, but I think it's better on the health plan side than it is the provider side.

**Client**
Okay, that's super helpful. What questions have we not asked you that you think we should have asked you?

**Expert**
If I were to come up with a particular question, I think the only thing I would say is that this space is going to get a lot of attention, not only because it's using AI to scale and run through a lot of data points. I think what's going to determine whether someone's successful or not is their ability to maintain the integrity and where they warehouse and operate.

Having things that are conducted in the U.S. and not overseas is very critical to many organizations. For us particularly, we will not work with an organization if they're outsourcing these types of core processes that involve the EMR offshore. I think you got to make sure that the folks you're dealing with, do they understand where they're showing their business?

**Client**
That's a good point. Charta is obviously a fairly early stage company. You heard about it through one of your industry contacts. Did that individual end up going to Charta or Limo Health at the time?

**Expert**
They did.

**Client**
Okay, great. How would you characterize their market presence? Are they still a young player, not many people have heard of them.

**Expert**
I think there's still room for folks to get to know them. What I can say in the small time that they've really put their name out there is it's attracted a lot of attention. I know I was speaking at a conference last week in Dallas. Their name came up a number of times in the room. There was folks who was the CIO of Mayo Clinic. They're generating the right attention with the right organizations. I saw a health plan speak about them as well.

**Client**
I have one question. Your current coders, and your coders specifically, are they using a piece of dedicated software for any sort of coding assistance, anything like that upstream?

**Expert**
Yeah, we do. We use dedicated software and things of that nature. Some of that is developed in-house. Some of it is through third parties, but couldn't detail that with you.

**Client**
Got it. My question is, presumably, if either the stuff that you guys have built in-house or the third parties you're working with, as they try to evolve their product, will try to get better at coding and in theory capture more of these potential issues upstream. I'm curious, obviously it's very early with Charta, but what you think happens longer term? Do you still need a solution like a Charta downstream if these coding tools get better and more accurate over time? Just curious to hear how you think that plays out.

**Expert**
I think the whole industry is going to continue to evolve in that sense. I think we all recognize that the service you provide, you want to make sure that the claim is being adjudicated and that you're getting paid. I think as long as there is a transaction involved, you're going to see whatever tools that need to occur. The question is if there was one tool that could do it all, we'd all be all over it.

Epic is not the be-all to EMRS. Oracle isn't the be-all as well. There's always going to require some sort of capability because healthcare is so personal. It is so local too in how it's accessed and how it's utilized. You're always going to have nuances. The question is, "As we develop and identify issues, what is the solution that's going to be developed to solve it?"

I think the ones that are able to rapidly evolve and understand, "Can I eventually someday become a partner to an Epic where Epic is the lion's share of the inpatient EMR business?" maybe that's the next iteration of it. Epic keeps talking about they're getting into AI. They're trying to rapidly do it, but their architecture is very different. In order to maintain what they're very good at, they're going to have to evolve as well with this. I think that's what we're all doing right now.

**Client**
Got it. Makes sense. Maybe last two questions since you are clearly on the forefront of looking at innovative companies, any other start-ups we should be on our radar?

**Expert**
Yeah. Maybe not so much on the tech side, but companies that I like are Curana Health, Sprinter Health, Reimagine Care. Those are ones that I look at and I follow. I think they're doing some things right. Those are ones that I think for anyone who's interested in seeing how healthcare evolves into an ecosystem, follow those.

**Client**
Okay. The very last question is on a scale of 1-10, one being horrible, would not recommend to others to 10 being phenomenal, would highly recommend to others, where would you rate Charta Health and why?

**Expert**
Right now, I'd rate them on a 7/10 because I think they're trying to do something indifferent. So far, they've been able to figure out a mechanism for doing that. I think they're honest, they're transparent, and they're ethical in their approach. I think they're willing to custom-develop these solutions, and I think the background and the integrity of the leadership is such that it gives me comfort knowing where their mindset and what their worldview is in that space.

**Client**
Thank you for taking the time to speak with me. Have a nice day.
