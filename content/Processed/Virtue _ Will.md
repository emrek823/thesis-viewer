### Origin Story & Vision

- Did soul searching and kept coming back to 2020 vision of transforming brokers
- Experience in South FL and TX markets showed carriers and industry didn’t love brokers
- Consumer lines revealed different dynamics:
	- ACA policies transient but members never left their broker
	- Brokers had lifetime LTV vs carrier’s 1-year relationship
	- Brokers became most trusted source of healthcare finance advisory services
	- Always the first call from members
- Previously at Oscar: tried building broker compensation model and UI for appointments/HRAs but deprioritized
- Watched broker channel take over entire ACA distribution
- PE loves these businesses (20-30% margins, high revenue)
- Considered rolling up ACA assets before market surge

### Strategic Approach

- AI rollup strategy combines two parts:
	- Platform development
	- Broker acquisition
- If executing both well: transformational opportunity
- Brokers typically fail by messing up CAC/LTV
- Target: buying local community-driven brokers with aggregated demand
- CAC/LTV profile looks different than eHealth model

### Financing Structure

- Raising $8-10M split between:
	- Platform team development
	- Initial acquisition
- Speed critical for market position
- Most advanced discussions with:
	- GC: Enormous swing potential, creative financing vehicle
	- Andreessen: Julie and Daisy get exceptional founder feedback, strong early-stage business builder
- Target ownership: mid-high teens to low twenties

### AI Strategy & Validation

- Limited window (2-3 years) for AI adoption arbitrage
- Success criteria:
	- Tasks with repetition without variance (80% of enrollments basically identical)
	- Clean, machine-readable data pipes
	- Real human arbitrage opportunity
- Revenue generation alpha:
	- Cross-sell opportunity can 2-2.5x ARPU
	- Focus on adjacent products (dental, vision, life)
- Validation through design partner calls
- Focus on renewal support and capacity enhancement

### Regulatory Landscape

Three tiers of compliance:

- Green: Eligibility information, appointment booking
- Yellow: Plan recommendations, clinical information
- Red: Enrollment submission
- Web broker precedent exists (HealthSherpa, eHealth)

### Market Evolution

- Currently need agency owner signoff
- Industry likely moving toward oligopoly
- Large players (Integrity, AmeriLife) rolling up capacity
- Public brokerages trade at 15-25x multiples
- Many worth $10-15B+, larger than insurance businesses

### Investor Landscape

- Sequoia/TCap: Strong healthcare focus
- A16z/GC comparison:
	- GC requires personality to navigate large organization
	- A16z offers stronger marketing engine
- Lightspeed: Brenton highlighted as favorite investor
- Ownership structure: GC likely to take 6-8M of 8-10M raise
