## Slide 5

Our Platform Can Address Key Questions in Real-time

Is it worth the cost and time to add a biomarker to increase the program pTRS?
Is it worth the cost to add trial sites to reduce cycle-time?
I must hit a budget target, how do I best preserve value in tradeoffs?
What is the variation in value given the variation in cost, time, and pTRS estimates?

Add mean and confidence interval per productivity factor

Understand the distribution of eNPV

View the variation of free cash flow over program life

Understand which factors drive value in the program

Proprietary high-dimensional simulation algorithm
