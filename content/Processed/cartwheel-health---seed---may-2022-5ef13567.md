## Slide 5: Schools are on the frontlines of a youth mental health crisis

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY

* 1 in 5 students has a mental health disorder
* Students struggle with absences, dropouts, challenging behaviors
* Staff are overwhelmed, lacking time and training to meet needs
* Schools can't find more staff locally, even with funding

"My school's mental health team is at half capacity because people have burned out or gone on leave. We put out a job description for more psychologists and social workers—great pay and benefits—but we didn't even get a nibble. We can't find any full-time providers locally. We’re barely hanging on here. We need help."
Alison M.,
Clinical Psychologist

## Slide 12: What makes us different

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY

### Schools as a channel
Compare to most telehealth startups
* Superior clinical outcomes
* Lower patient acquisition costs
* Sticky contracts
* Additional data on students and their context
* Combined revenue from schools and payers
* Horizontal expansion (e.g., staff mental health, psychoeducational testing, speech and occupational therapy)

### Tiered, team-based care model
Compare to school-based mental health startups
* Mental health pure play, focusing on the most burning issue facing schools today
* More than therapy: Tiered care model from prevention - treatment
* Team-based care model is better for students and school staff and helps us recruit and retain providers

## Slide 13: Path to scale

### Seed: Scale in Massachusetts
* Win key districts through our unique advisor and founder networks
* Crush our pilot and start the flywheel of district-to-district referrals
* Build care team with help from advisors at MA training institutions (e.g., MGH, BC)
* Contract with a critical mass of insurers

### Series A: Grow in volume + profitability
* Sign multiple large districts in MA and gain a foothold in 3-5 priority expansion states
* Add elementary grades (+25-50% revenue)
* Treat educators & staff (+10-15% revenue)
* Add higher-margin services (e.g., group therapy, helping schools bill insurers for services they already provide)
* Build a care team pipeline (see appendix)
