Insurance [hashtag Float](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=%23float&origin=HASH_TAG_FROM_FEED) Explained: What is it? Implications for Health Insurance?  
  
Insurance float is the money an insurance company holds between when it receives premium payments and when it pays out claims.  
  
Insurance companies then invest that float money in bonds, stocks or other investments to earn a return. That investment income contributes toward the insurance company's profit.  
  
Insurance companies also make underwriting profit from charging premiums in excess of claims and their own internal expenses such as broker commission payments and payroll.  
  
Float is equal to upwards of 2.5X total premiums for Property and Casualty (P&C) insurance companies, 10X for Life insurance companies... but only 0.3X for health insurance companies.  
  
Correction: I should have said $100M to $300M in my health insurance float example, not $10M to $30M.  
  
Accordingly, investment income from float makes up 70% of P&C insurance profit, 90% of life insurance profit... but only 20% of health insurance profit.  
  
Health insurance companies still work to maximize float by prolonging reimbursement to healthcare providers like doctors and hospitals.  
  
For a healthcare provider, the insurance carrier's float is their Accounts Receivable.  
  
New technology such as AI is unlikely to reduce healthcare provider accounts receivable because delayed payment is not a technology problem, but rather an intentional strategy by health insurance companies to maximize profit.
