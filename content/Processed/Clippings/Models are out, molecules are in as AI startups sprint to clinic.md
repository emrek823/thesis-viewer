## Mod­els are out, mol­e­cules are in as AI star­tups sprint to clin­ic

Chris Bahl saw the writ­ing on the wall for his new AI start­up in the fi­nal weeks of 2022: Mol­e­cules would mat­ter more than mod­els.

A pair of preprints had just come out, both show­ing dif­fu­sion mod­els that could gen­er­ate not just im­ages, but pro­teins. Bahl, then the chief sci­en­tist of his start­up AI Pro­teins, re­al­ized that the still-young AI bio sec­tor was about to change.

He con­clud­ed that the race to build lead­ing AI pro­tein mod­els was too com­modi­tized, es­pe­cial­ly as these cut­ting-edge mod­els called RFd­if­fu­sion and Chro­ma be­came freely avail­able as open-source tech­nol­o­gy. Bahl stopped his team’s ef­forts on build­ing gen­er­al-pur­pose pro­tein mod­els, shift­ing fo­cus to nar­row­er AI ap­pli­ca­tions for oth­er drug de­vel­op­ment tasks.

“I saw no path to ROI for gen­er­at­ing a pro­pri­etary mod­el,” Bahl, now the CEO of AI Pro­teins, said in an in­ter­view.

To­day, much of the AI bio field has come around to Bahl’s po­si­tion, turn­ing its fo­cus to the drug in­dus­try’s bread and but­ter of cre­at­ing and de­vel­op­ing new mol­e­cules. New, ad­vanced AI mod­els for bi­ol­o­gy are still be­ing de­vel­oped and used in that process. But there’s less in­ter­est in star­tups ad­vanc­ing cut­ting-edge AI tech with a hunch that a vi­able busi­ness will fol­low.

These star­tups need to show that the lat­est AI tech­nolo­gies can pro­duce not just preprints, but ac­tu­al drug pro­grams. This next gen­er­a­tion of com­pa­nies, like Bahl’s, is sprint­ing to the clin­ic, with 2026 shap­ing up to be a re­al­i­ty check on whether gen­er­a­tive AI can fi­nal­ly move the nee­dle on R&D pro­duc­tiv­i­ty.

#### Mar­ket’s ‘peren­ni­al swing’ fa­vors as­sets

To an­a­lyze what 2026 holds for AI in biotech, *End­points News* re­viewed the pipelines of 11 lead­ing AI drug star­tups, most­ly found­ed be­tween 2018 and 2021.

Many are fi­nal­ly mov­ing in­to hu­man test­ing, where the sec­tor’s big promis­es will be test­ed: Out of the 11 com­pa­nies, there are cur­rent­ly eight pro­grams in hu­man test­ing. By the end of next year, that num­ber is ex­pect­ed to near­ly triple to 21 pro­grams in the clin­ic.

“There’s a peren­ni­al swing be­tween as­sets and plat­forms,” said El­liot Her­sh­berg, a biotech in­vestor at Men­lo Park-based Am­pli­fy Part­ners, which raised its first ded­i­cat­ed biotech fund this year. “That has clear­ly di­aled more to­wards as­sets in this re­cent mar­ket,” he said in an in­ter­view.

There are many ex­am­ples. This year, San Diego-based Iambic [raised $100 mil­lion](https://endpoints.news/ai-biotech-iambic-raises-100m-from-ark-regeneron/) af­ter its first clin­i­cal read­out, and plans to use the cash to bring two more drugs in­to hu­man test­ing in 2026.

Ear­li­er this month, Gen­er­ate:Bio­med­i­cines [took its lead pro­gram in­to Phase 3](https://endpoints.news/generatebiomedicines-to-start-phase-3-studies-for-tslp-antibody/) — a mile­stone that the first wave of AI-fo­cused biotechs like Re­cur­sion, In­sil­i­co Med­i­cine, and Ab­sci have yet to reach. The Flag­ship-found­ed com­pa­ny ex­pects to soon file two more new drug ap­pli­ca­tions with reg­u­la­tors, for can­cer pro­grams.

And while the field’s rich­est star­tups, in­clud­ing Iso­mor­phic Labs and Xaira Ther­a­peu­tics, have re­mained tight-lipped on lead pro­grams and clin­i­cal time­lines, both have said they’re al­so large­ly fo­cused on build­ing pipelines. Iso­mor­phic, for ex­am­ple, used a chunk of the $600 mil­lion it raised this year [to es­tab­lish a Boston area of­fice](https://endpoints.news/alphabet-backed-isomorphic-labs-to-open-us-office-hires-ex-relay-cmo/) and hire up a clin­i­cal de­vel­op­ment team led by ex-Re­lay Ther­a­peu­tics’ Ben Wolf as chief med­ical of­fi­cer.

Oth­ers, how­ev­er, seem stuck in what Her­sh­berg calls a “weird dan­ger zone,” be­tween build­ing a pipeline and sell­ing tools or ser­vices. That in­cludes cau­tion­ary tales like Evo­lu­tion­aryScale, which raised a $142 mil­lion seed round in 2024 with plans to build mas­sive AI mod­els in bi­ol­o­gy. This year, with lit­tle to show for progress since its de­but, it was [fold­ed in­to Mark Zucker­berg’s non­prof­it sci­ence project](https://endpoints.news/zuckerberg-backed-biohub-hires-evolutionaryscale-team-in-apparent-end-of-ai-startup/), un­der undis­closed deal terms.

#### ‘Show me the mon­ey’

The sec­tor’s evolv­ing fo­cus has some­times led to ma­jor changes at the com­pa­nies. Af­ter five years of “Al­phaFold-for-X” star­tups in­spired by Deep­Mind’s 2020 pro­tein struc­ture-pre­dict­ing mod­el, many of the com­pa­nies are piv­ot­ing to pipelines.

Lon­don-based CHARM Ther­a­peu­tics was found­ed in 2021 by Laksh Aithani, then a 23-year-old wun­derkind who de­vel­oped an AI mod­el called Drag­on­Fold to pre­dict pro­tein-lig­and struc­tures.

A first-time CEO, Aithani raised a $50 mil­lion Se­ries A in 2022 from top-tier in­vestors and dreamed of build­ing the next As­traZeneca off AI’s po­ten­tial.

In­stead, this spring, he [left as CEO](https://endpoints.news/charm-therapeutics-founder-laksh-aithani-is-out-as-ceo/) in a mu­tu­al­ly agreed de­ci­sion with the board. The com­pa­ny is now led by Gary Glick, its 64-year-old ex­ec­u­tive chair and a se­r­i­al biotech en­tre­pre­neur, and the CEO slot is emp­ty. Un­der Glick, CHARM [raised an $80 mil­lion Se­ries B](https://endpoints.news/nvidia-backed-charm-therapeutics-gets-80m-to-take-ai-designed-cancer-drug-to-clinic/), meant to get its lead drug in­to the clin­ic in ear­ly 2026.

While CHARM’s Se­ries A was dri­ven off the po­ten­tial and ex­cite­ment for Drag­on­Fold, the Se­ries B was fu­eled by pre­clin­i­cal da­ta pack­ages and a plan of reach­ing clin­i­cal proof-of-con­cept.

“You don’t get cred­it for aca­d­e­m­ic pa­pers,” said Carl Hansen, the CEO of Ab­Cellera, a com­pu­ta­tion­al-fo­cused biotech he co-found­ed in 2012. “You don’t get cred­it for things on the pipeline that are pre­clin­i­cal. You get cred­it for mol­e­cules.”

Hansen piv­ot­ed Ab­Cellera’s own busi­ness strat­e­gy in 2023 to fo­cus on the pipeline. He ex­pects a read­out in mid-2026 for its lead can­di­date, an an­ti­body tar­get­ing NK3R.

“Our be­lief is: ‘Show me the mon­ey,’” Hansen said in an in­ter­view. “The mon­ey is drugs in the clin­ic that ul­ti­mate­ly get good da­ta and make a dif­fer­ence.”

#### Wait­ing for the clin­i­cal proof

Not that get­ting to the clin­ic solves an AI start­up’s chal­lenges. It’s just the be­gin­ning of a gru­el­ing jour­ney full of hard de­ci­sions on how to move for­ward. Many of the high-fly­ing AI star­tups will ul­ti­mate­ly be mea­sured by how they do at the bor­ing, old work of de­sign­ing and run­ning the right clin­i­cal stud­ies, of­ten in com­pet­i­tive crowd­ed drug class­es like TL1A or HER2.

“Sud­den­ly you’re com­pet­ing not on dis­cov­ery. You’re com­pet­ing against your abil­i­ty to do clin­i­cal de­vel­op­ment and have a low cost of cap­i­tal,” Hansen said. “Be­fore you know it, you’re $400 mil­lion in­to that and it no longer makes any sense to de­vel­op, to in­vest in, the plat­form ca­pa­bil­i­ties.”

Ab­Cellera doesn’t pub­lish or talk much about the in­ter­me­di­ate steps be­hind its own an­ti­body dis­cov­ery process. With the mar­ket’s em­pha­siz­ing as­sets, Hansen said the com­pa­ny wouldn’t — and shouldn’t — get cred­it for that type of work.

“Every­one should be skep­ti­cal of every­thing every­one is say­ing, in­clud­ing me, un­til I show you the ev­i­dence,” Hansen said. “The ev­i­dence has to be smart choic­es on drugs that are high­ly dif­fer­en­ti­at­ed that are at least in the clin­ic.”
