Since 1992, the 340B drug discount program has entitled certain federal grantee clinics and hospitals (called “covered entities”) to purchase outpatient drugs at substantial discounts. The discounted drugs can be used for all of the entity’s patients, even those insured patients who pay amounts substantially above the discounted price. In this case, the revenue from patients and insurers can be retained as profits that are [widely understood](https://www.help.senate.gov/hearings/the-340b-program-examining-its-growth-and-impact-on-patients) to be intended to improve access to care for patients who rely on the safety net.

At the time of its passage, 340B was expected to be a small program. In addition to the federal grantee clinics, [fewer than one percent of hospitals](https://schaeffer.usc.edu/research/the-340b-drug-pricing-program-background-ongoing-challenges-and-recent-developments/) participated in the first decade of the program. Today, lax enforcement of program eligibility rules combined with two [key](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2010-03-05/pdf/2010-4755.pdf) program [expansions](https://www.congress.gov/111/plaws/publ148/PLAW-111publ148.pdf) around 2010, the program has grown to include two-thirds of all non-profit hospitals in the United States and the discounted cost of the purchases has reached $ [66B](https://www.hrsa.gov/opa/updates/2023-340b-covered-entity-purchases).

This growth combined with the Health Resources and Services Administration’s (HRSA) [limited](https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-21-107.pdf) capability for [oversight](https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-18-480.pdf) has created program integrity challenges, most notably "duplicate discounts." Duplicate discounts occur when a 340B discount is claimed on a drug that is also subject to Medicaid–or very soon [Medicare](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/5376/text) –price concessions. Preventing duplicate discounts in the Medicaid program has long proven a difficult challenge. 340B discounts are provided upfront, before being dispensed or administered to patients, whereas Medicaid’s discount is provided as a rebate, after the transaction has occurred. Manufacturer post-transaction rebates to commercial plans also frequently overlap with 340B discounts, creating so-called “stacked discounts.” IQVIA [estimated](https://www.iqvia.com/locations/united-states/blogs/2021/12/uncover-the-invisible-impacts-of-340b-discounts) that roughly one quarter of sales subject to 340B discounted drugs were also subject to another price concession.

This longstanding challenge has now been amplified by the Inflation Reduction Act’s ([IRA](https://www.congress.gov/117/plaws/publ169/PLAW-117publ169.pdf)) Medicare drug price negotiation. Although patients’ cost-sharing will reflect negotiated prices at the point of sale, most pharmacies will need to seek a [post-transaction rebate from the manufacturer](https://schaeffer.usc.edu/research/medicare-drug-prices-mfp-effectuation/) for the first ten drugs negotiated under the IRA. These ten drugs accounted for $56.2 billion in 2023 Part D [spending](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/medicare-drug-price-negotiation-program-negotiated-prices-initial-price-applicability-year-2026), creating a new and urgent duplicate discount challenge. Perhaps spurred by this challenge and other new requirements under the IRA, several [manufacturers](https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/LSB10842) filed [lawsuits](https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/LSB11163) seeking to provide 340B discounts as rebates rather than upfront discounts. This change would better align the timing of 340B with concessions for other purchasers and provide manufacturers with [“real time data” and “transparency” to the manufacturer](https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/egvbjoronvq/JJ%20Health%20Care%20Systems%20v%20Becerra%2020241112.pdf).

Although the lawsuits were unsuccessful, HRSA has [established](https://www.hrsa.gov/about/news/press-releases/rebate-model-pilot-program) a rebate pilot program focused solely on the ten drugs currently subjected to IRA’s drug price negotiation, set to begin in January 2026. While the rebate pilot may help manufacturers with program integrity, converting the program from an upfront discount to a rebate may create significant operational and financial challenges for some covered entities. As such, the rebate starkly presents the key tradeoff between program integrity and financial stability for safety net providers and poses an important question: can the 340B rebate model help improve program integrity without threatening the financial stability of the very providers the program is designed to help?

## The 340B Rebate Pilot

Put simply, the 340B rebate pilot is designed to change the program's timing: instead of providing discounts up front, 340B discounts will be provided after drugs have been dispensed, like Medicaid, commercial, and the new Medicare drug rebates. HRSA’s 340B Rebate Pilot Program begins January 1st, 2026 and will focus on the ten drugs subject to Medicare negotiation. As of this post, the plans of eight of the ten manufacturers have been [approved](https://www.hrsa.gov/opa/340b-model-pilot-program).

According to HRSA, the approved plans require pharmacies (including those owned or contracted with covered entities) to purchase the pilot drugs at their full Wholesale Acquisition Cost (WAC) through their normal 340B wholesaler account. After dispensing the drug to an eligible patient, the 340B covered entity would then request a rebate from the manufacturer. To request the rebate, the covered entity (or third party working on its behalf) prepares and submits a data file to the manufacturer, which works with an IT platform to calculate and issue the 340B rebate directly to the covered entity. This process is expected to take place within ten days of the data submission and would create a single, auditable record for each 340B-eligible drug [claim](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-08-07/pdf/2025-14998.pdf).

The stated goal of the rebate model is enhanced program [integrity](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-08-07/pdf/2025-14998.pdf). By creating a transparent, auditable transaction for every claim, it could help prevent the problem of overlapping 340B discounts for Medicare negotiated prices discounts.

## Varying Financial Impacts On Providers

Although the rebate model provides more transparency for manufacturers, the financial risk for providers cannot be ignored. By moving the discount from upfront to post-purchase, the pilot places the burden of temporarily carrying higher WAC-based drug costs on providers' balance sheets. This creates a new legal and financial risk, particularly for entities with low cash reserves that depend on the immediate 340B savings to "stretch scarce federal resources," as HRSA [states](https://www.hrsa.gov/opa).

The financial risk will not be shared equally across covered entities. Large, non-profit hospitals are better equipped to wait ten days for the 340B rebate as they have greater cash reserves than other 340B covered entities, typically have access to credit, and enjoy economies of scale in purchasing. In contrast, federal grantees (such as community health centers) typically face tight budgets and depend heavily on Medicaid as well as federal grant revenue. As such they have far fewer resources available to cope with waiting for the 340B discount for ten days. Public hospitals will likely face similar problems to federal grantees.

Another critical difference between non-profit hospitals on one hand and the federal grantees and public hospitals on the other contributes to differing abilities to cope. Grantees and public hospitals typically have a requirement to share 340B discounts with patients, either directly through sliding fee scales or indirectly by providing care regardless of ability to pay. Nonprofit hospitals face no such requirement, and there is little evidence that the substantial 340B revenue they generate from billing insurers and patients ends up benefitting patients either [directly](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34668672/) or [indirectly](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32187392/).

It should be noted that many covered entities already purchase drugs that will ultimately be subject to 340B discounts at higher upfront prices. Under so-called [“virtual inventory models”](https://www.pharmacytimes.com/view/minimizing-wac-exposure-to-decrease-drug-expense-in-the-virtual-inventory-setting) initial or ongoing purchases of drugs are initially purchased at WAC.

## Upfront Discounts Or Rebates? A Lesson From History

The concern for federal grantees and public hospitals is not theoretical. The 340B program was originally conceived as a [rebate](https://www.congress.gov/bill/102nd-congress/house-bill/3405), with early legislative [drafts](https://www.congress.gov/bill/102nd-congress/senate-bill/1729/text/is) including a rebate version to align with the Medicaid program. However, as Congressional staffers learned more about the unique challenges of safety net providers, they realized a rebate model could pose significant administrative and financial challenges (information drawn from interviews that are not yet published). These cash-strapped clinics lacked the resources to track volume and monitor prices, and they could not "float" the funds during the time lag required to recover a rebate. Furthermore, some clinics worried that a rebate might be counted against their federal grants, further-reducing scarce funds. The program was subsequently [changed](https://www.congress.gov/bill/102nd-congress/senate-bill/1729/text/rs) to an upfront discount to minimize this financial risk to its safety net providers.

## Monitoring Will Be Essential

A pilot program allows HRSA to test this central trade-off of whether a rebate model can improve program integrity without threatening the financial stability of safety net providers. As the pilot model unfolds, tracking both program and covered entity outcomes will be very important—specifically, cash-flow impact and administrative burden by type of 340B covered entity–grantee, public hospital, and non-profit hospitals. Additionally, non-profit hospital outcomes should be stratified by key factors such as whether the hospital is a teaching hospital, part of a system, and whether the hospital serves a predominantly rural population.

The size and scope of the 340B program maximize the potential for interactions with other programs. As such, other elements of the health care delivery and financing system may be affected. For example, it is unlikely that covered entities, especially grantees and public hospitals, will have free resources to devote to new data submission, compliance, and monitoring costs. The rebate pilot could therefore have an unintended consequence of increasing fees for these providers that chip away at the 340B revenue generated to support access to care for safety net patients. [Transparency data from Minnesota](https://www.health.state.mn.us/data/340b/docs/2024report.pdf) show that even before the rebate model, federal grantees pay significantly more, proportionately in fees to third-party administrators.

Another potential unintended consequence comes from interactions with the Medicaid program. Many states pay 340B covered entities the 340B acquisition cost for drugs in the Medicaid program. However, for these ten drugs, the cost at which covered entities acquire drugs that will eventually be subject to 340B discounts, is the WAC. The language of state policies [may need to be adjusted](https://www.milliman.com/en/insight/340b-rebate-model-pilot-program-medicaid-implications) so that acquisition cost represents the 340B discount, not the WAC.

## Conclusion

The 340B rebate pilot weights program integrity against financial stability for safety net providers. A formal evaluation will be necessary to assess whether and to what extent the program compromises the stability of the safety net and whether it creates other unintended consequences.
