AstraZeneca, Tempus AI and Pathos AI have entered a multi-year, strategic collaboration to build a multimodal foundation model in oncology.

The model will be used to gather biological and clinical insights, discover novel drug targets, and develop therapeutics for the broader oncology community.

Upon completion, the model will be shared among all three parties to advance their individual efforts to improve patient care. The agreements include $200 million in data licensing and model development fees to Tempus.

“Cancer drug discovery and clinical development are being transformed by the ability to analyse vast amounts of rich data using artificial intelligence,” said Jorge Reis-Filho, Chief AI and Data Scientist, Oncology R&D, AstraZeneca. “We are excited to collaborate with Tempus and Pathos to advance our data and AI-driven R&D strategy through the development of a multimodal oncology foundation model that we believe will accelerate and increase the probability of clinical success across our diverse pipeline.”

The agreement with AstraZeneca expands on the strategic partnership between the two companies announced in 2021 and aims to leverage Tempus’ AI-enabled platform and vast repository of multimodal data.

“Generative AI and the emergence of large multimodal models is the final catalyst needed to usher in precision medicine in oncology at scale,” said Eric Lefkofsky, Founder and CEO of Tempus. “Tempus has spent the last decade investing billions of dollars into collecting the necessary data needed for a foundation model of this kind to take shape. We look forward to working with AstraZeneca and Pathos to apply AI-enabled solutions to advance therapies in an effort to help patients live longer and healthier lives.”
