## Weak­ened Biose­cure Act poised to be­come law af­ter Sen­ate pas­sage

The Biose­cure Act is slat­ed to be­come law af­ter the Sen­ate on Wednes­day passed a de­fense bill that in­cludes the mea­sure.

It’s a de­vel­op­ment that once would have sent pan­ic through drug­mak­er board­rooms. But the leg­is­la­tion has since been weak­ened. Biose­cure would re­strict fed­er­al con­tracts with bio­phar­ma sup­pli­ers deemed for­eign ad­ver­saries, though un­like ear­li­er drafts, it stops short of nam­ing the ubiq­ui­tous con­trac­tors [WuXi AppTec and WuXi Bi­o­log­ics](https://endpoints.news/wuxi-became-a-critical-partner-to-biopharma-companies-theyre-not-ready-if-the-us-cracks-down/).

Sens. Bill Hager­ty (R-TN) and Gary Pe­ters (D-MI) re­vived the leg­is­la­tion this sum­mer fol­low­ing in­flu­en­tial op­po­si­tion.

Last year, Rep. Jim Mc­Gov­ern (D-MA) and Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) [killed Biose­cure](https://endpoints.news/houses-prominent-china-critic-jim-mcgovern-leads-opposition-to-biosecure-act-i-would-prefer-to-go-back-to-the-drawing-board/) by ar­gu­ing it lacks due process for the WuXi en­ti­ties. That led to a com­pro­mise ver­sion that no longer names spe­cif­ic com­pa­nies. In­stead, the lat­est it­er­a­tion im­pos­es re­stric­tions on com­pa­nies that are on fed­er­al watch­lists. The Sen­ate [vot­ed in Oc­to­ber](https://endpoints.news/wuxi-companies-left-out-of-latest-version-of-biosecure-act/) to at­tach this new ver­sion to the an­nu­al de­fense pol­i­cy bill.

Oth­er changes will al­so like­ly re­duce the bill’s im­pact.

Ear­li­er ver­sions raised fears that phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pa­nies part­nered with flagged sup­pli­ers could lose Med­ic­aid el­i­gi­bil­i­ty, a ma­jor source of fund­ing. The fi­nal lan­guage in­di­cates that Med­ic­aid par­tic­i­pa­tion can­not be re­voked sole­ly be­cause a con­trac­tor ap­pears on a watch­list, and com­pa­nies would be giv­en time to un­wind ex­ist­ing con­tracts with named sup­pli­ers.

Yet Biose­cure could still be a threat to WuXi AppTec, due to a re­lat­ed de­vel­op­ment.

In Oc­to­ber, the Pen­ta­gon in­di­cat­ed it will add WuXi AppTec to its 1260H list of Chi­nese mil­i­tary com­pa­nies, [*Bloomberg News*](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-26/pentagon-cited-alibaba-on-china-military-aid-in-oct-7-letter) re­port­ed. Biose­cure de­fers to that list to de­ter­mine which Chi­nese biotech sup­pli­ers should face US re­stric­tions.

WuXi AppTec has said it doesn’t have mil­i­tary ties and doesn’t fit the cri­te­ria for des­ig­na­tion. It’s un­clear if the Pen­ta­gon will fol­low through on plans to add the com­pa­ny.

Com­pa­nies al­ready on the 1260H list in­clude the ge­net­ic test­ing firms BGI Group and MGI Tech, their place­ment on which will make them a tar­get un­der Biose­cure. These com­pa­nies, un­like the WuXi en­ti­ties, aren’t a fix­ture in the in­dus­try. An ear­ly ver­sion of Biose­cure was in­tro­duced just as MGI was ramp­ing up US ex­pan­sion plans, [mak­ing labs re­luc­tant](https://endpoints.news/in-clash-over-science-and-national-security-chinese-rival-to-illumina-struggles-with-us-expansion/) to con­sid­er buy­ing the com­pa­ny’s DNA se­quencers.

The House [passed](https://endpoints.news/house-backs-biosecure-act-aimed-at-chinese-companies/) the an­nu­al de­fense bill, in­clud­ing Biose­cure, last week. It now heads to Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s desk for his sig­na­ture.
