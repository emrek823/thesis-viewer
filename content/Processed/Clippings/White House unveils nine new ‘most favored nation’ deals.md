## White House un­veils nine new ‘most fa­vored na­tion’ deals

The White House on Fri­day an­nounced new deals with nine ma­jor drug­mak­ers, fi­nal­iz­ing an end-of-year push by Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump to make good on his “most fa­vored na­tion” pledge for low­er med­i­cine prices.

Am­gen, Boehringer In­gel­heim, Bris­tol My­ers Squibb, Genen­tech, GSK, Gilead, Mer­ck, No­var­tis and Sanofi agreed to sell se­lect med­i­cines at low­ered prices along the lines of some Eu­ro­pean and oth­er com­pa­ra­ble coun­tries.

A se­nior ad­min­is­tra­tion of­fi­cial pre­dict­ed ma­jor re­duc­tions in Med­ic­aid prices as a re­sult of the lat­est deals. They said that many of the cur­rent Med­ic­aid prices for drugs from com­pa­nies in Fri­day’s deals are much high­er than what oth­er, com­pa­ra­ble coun­tries are pay­ing.

All of the com­pa­nies with MFN deals have al­so agreed that any new prod­uct launch­es will come at the low­ered, MFN-based prices. It re­mains un­clear how this vol­un­tary agree­ment might ex­tend be­yond the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion. The White House has yet to say if the de­tails of the deals will be made pub­lic.

The new agree­ments mark con­sid­er­able progress for Trump in his drug pric­ing push, even as the ex­act de­tails of the com­mit­ments re­main scant. In Ju­ly, he [sent let­ters to 17 drug­mak­ers](https://endpoints.news/trump-demands-pharma-ceos-implement-most-favored-nation-pricing-within-60-days/) de­mand­ing that they im­ple­ment MFN pric­ing. Now, on­ly three who re­ceived those let­ters haven’t made a deal yet — Ab­b­Vie, J&J, and Re­gen­eron.

#### Deal de­tails

In ex­change for the price cuts, the com­pa­nies will al­so re­ceive a three-year re­prieve from tar­iffs, in line with pre­vi­ous drug pric­ing deals. A se­nior ad­min­is­tra­tion of­fi­cial said that each of these com­pa­nies has ne­go­ti­at­ed a sep­a­rate agree­ment with the De­part­ment of Com­merce mak­ing them el­i­gi­ble for the re­prieve if they on­shore an equiv­a­lent val­ue of drugs that they im­port.

The White House al­so said that it is rec­om­mend­ing to the FDA which of these com­pa­nies’ drugs should win the Com­mis­sion­er’s Na­tion­al Pri­or­i­ty Vouch­er, which could speed up FDA re­views by as much as 10 months**.** The White House con­firmed that com­pa­nies in­volved in the MFN deals are not re­ceiv­ing a com­mit­ment that they will re­ceive such a vouch­er and the FDA is not re­quired to grant a vouch­er as part of any MFN deal.

The White House ear­ly next year al­so plans to launch a new gov­ern­ment site, known as TrumpRx, to help pa­tients find some mail-or­der drugs at the dis­count­ed rates. A se­nior ad­min­is­tra­tion of­fi­cial said they’re work­ing with man­u­fac­tur­ers to in­clude their prod­ucts on the web­site, which they said will be a good op­tion for those who are unin­sured or un­der-in­sured.
