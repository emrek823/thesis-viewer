❓ What’s the best LLM for biomedical research?  
  
We get this question a lot at [Sage Bionetworks](https://www.linkedin.com/company/sage-bionetworks/).  
While strong benchmarks exist (e.g. BixBench from [FutureHouse](https://www.linkedin.com/company/futurehouse/), BioMLBench  
from [Bo Wang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bo-wang-a6065240/)), we felt something was missing: evaluation grounded in real biomedical questions and expert judgment.  
  
Today, we’re launching [BioArena.io](http://bioarena.io/)  
  
BioArena is a community-driven platform that benchmarks biomedical AI models through anonymous, head-to-head comparisons on real biomedical prompts. Domain experts vote on the most accurate and scientifically sound answers, producing transparent rankings based on real-world biomedical performance, not static test sets.  
  
Inspired by [MedArena.ai](http://medarena.ai/) ([James Zou](https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-zou-2123a4133/)) and following the path pioneered by [llmarena.ai](http://llmarena.ai/), BioArena is built by and for the biomedical research community.  
That’s why access is via [Synapse.org](http://synapse.org/) a large online biomedical community -- and why we’ll continue adding safeguards to ensure questions and ratings remain deeply biomedical in focus.  
  
We’re mindful of the limitations of leaderboards (as [Sara Hooker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sararosehooker/) and others have shown [https://lnkd.in/gYYQiGTa](https://lnkd.in/gYYQiGTa)). Still, imperfect evaluation beats no evaluation, especially when it is open, iterative, and community-governed.  
  
Please try it out, vote, and help us improve it.  
Our long-term vision is to evaluate not just single-turn answers, but multi-turn, analysis-rich, end-to-end biomedical AI agents.
