VIRTUE FUND II – MARKET OPPORTUNITY

### Market Evolution: HCIT in 2000’s to Rise of Care Delivery in 2010’s

Historical HCIT Consolidation: The 2000’s were an era of general technology commoditization in healthcare IT (HCIT), as leading vendors scaled through acquisitions and private equity rollups. Many of the vendors that dominate market share today across different categories (EMR, RCM, payer infra, clinical trials, etc) were founded through multiple PE-rollups, acquisitions, and mergers over decades. Change Healthcare (claims clearinghouse with >50% market share that Optum acquired for $11B) was originally a company called Emdeon operating under the WebMD umbrella. Cotiviti ($11B) and Zelis ($6.7B) have >50% market share in the payment integrity and claims editing space after 5+ acquisitions over decades. While these examples demonstrate the revenue potential for HCIT companies, they also present an opportunity to re-think how companies today can take market share from these incumbents built on decades old technology stacks, massive tech debt (and balance sheet debt), and a reluctance to innovate.

Landscape Re-framed with the ACA: The ACA (passed in 2010) fundamentally reshaped our healthcare systems, mainly by mandating insurance coverage for individuals and requiring adoption of electronic health and medical records. Furthermore, the HITECH Act (2009), part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), catalyzed the adoption of EHRs which jumped from 10-20% adoption in 2008 to >75% adoption in just six years, faster than personal computers (8-75% over 26 years) and the internet (10-75% over 18 years). The ACA also greatly accelerated the adoption of high-deductible health plans, which were planned to increase “consumerization” of healthcare to encourage patients to shop for high quality and lower cost options.

Digital Health 1.0: The ACA created regulatory tailwinds and increased the interest and overall perception of innovation in healthcare. As a result, more investors and founders entered the space as digital health venture funding grew from $600M in 2009 to $4.1B in 2014. Looking back, the top 3 investment categories at this time were healthcare consumer engagement (Zocdoc; $130M raise in 2014), wearables and biosensing (Jawbone $300M raise in 2014), and personal health tracking (23andMe raised $115M in 2014). In the early days, investors focused on “healthcare-light” investments that were more consumer-facing and required less regulation.

Rise of Care Delivery: In 2017-2018, care delivery companies started to scale as the overall distribution of company type (data, dollars, delivery) shifted towards delivery. From 2000 - 2010, 65% of “successful companies” (exit or private valuation >$1B) were data or dollars-focused, while 35% were delivery-focused. From 2010 - 2020, this flipped where 60% of successful companies were care delivery and 40% were data and dollars.
