### Dart Health Long-Term Vision

- Aims to be the “App Store” for hospitals for AI applications
- Targeting 80-90% of “super difficult” AI use cases in healthcare
	- Focused on tasks requiring higher-level clinicians (specialists, physicians, radiologists)
	- Less focused on administrative tasks like coding and prior authorization
	- Example: Malnutrition detection - missed heavily, high ROI, only few physicians catch it properly
- Wants to own both model development and deployment rails
	- Not just building models, but maintaining the platform and implementation
	- This approach enables customers to easily request additional features

### Competitive Advantage

- Differentiates from competitors (Palantir, Microsoft) through fine-tuned models
	- Takes customers from 60% automation to 80-90%+ automation
	- Competitors mostly deploy basic keyword-based solutions
	- Value difference: $1M/year vs. $3M/year contracts
- Winning against direct competitors (Beryllium, Charta)
	- Have won every deal against them despite competitors having $20M+ in funding each
	- Example: A customer signed with competitor then quit because Dart offers more customization
	- Success factors:
		- Focus on edge cases from day one
		- Deep customer communication - spend time understanding deep pain points
		- Faster implementation - 48 hours vs. 2-3 months for competitors
		- On-site work and engaging with all stakeholders

### Team Expansion Plans

- Looking to hire 2-3 key roles if funding secured:
	- Academic from MIT focused on healthcare ML/AI models (85% through hiring process)
		- Specialized in detecting conditions like malnutrition and seizure risk
		- Needs official offer with start date and compensation package
	- Person with sales experience (early discussions)
	- Implementation lead with healthcare consulting background
		- Person they’ve talked to for a year, previously decided to wait
- Planning to build NYC-based team
	- Prefers in-office culture over distributed team
	- NYC advantage: Less competition for engineering talent compared to SF

### Funding Strategy

- Not strictly against fundraising but approaches it strategically
	- “We’re going to do it very efficiently” with small strategic rounds
	- Current fundraise would accelerate hiring timeline
	- Would use funds to make immediate offers rather than waiting 45-60 days
- Has been operating efficiently without much funding ($600K raised)
	- Sees competitors using funding as “band-aids for problems”
	- Team size: 5-6 people vs. competitors with 35+ employees

### Business Ambitions

- Targeting $10B valuation in under a decade
	- Would reject $100M acquisition offer today
	- Likely requires going public rather than acquisition
	- Strategy to reach this target:
		- Serve government sector
		- Dominate care delivery space (inpatient/outpatient)
		- Similar product approach with targeted customization

### Next Steps

- Virtue VC wants to move forward with $1M investment on SAFE
	- Targeting approximately 10% ownership
	- Can issue term sheet and wire funds quickly
- Veeraj to provide within 2 days:
	- Customer references (at least 1-2)
	- Personal references (advisor who helped break into home health/hospice)
	- Legal entity name (not Dart Health Inc)
	- 1/2 page explaining competitive advantage vs Beryllium/Charta
- Veeraj will be less available next week due to two customer onboardings
