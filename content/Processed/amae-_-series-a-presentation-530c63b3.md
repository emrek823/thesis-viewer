Each patient spends >500 hours a year in Amae’s care

This enables Amae to build the largest dataset for SMI patients

Accurate prescribing -> reduced total cost of care -> higher revenue to Amae via shared savings
 
Care efficiency = higher contribution margins

Amae Institute is our academic research & AI technology platform that enhances care delivery

Signed research collaboration with UCLA Semel Institute of Neuroscience to analyze patient data from Amae clinics

Customer Issue

X

SMI patients are amongst the most expensive members for health plans

Ineffective spend directed at acute emergency care only

Methods of Contracting

Attributed Lives:PMPM + Fee-for-service + Shared Savings

Case Rate: 
Monthly bundled payments

Fee-For-Service: Partial Hospitalization (PHP) + Intensive Outpatient (IOP) + Behavioral Health (OP) + Physical Health (OP)

Customer Issue

Hospitals lose significant amounts of money on complex SMI patients

No safe discharge option - SMI is 2nd highest cause of readmission*

Methods of Contracting

Professional Services Agreement (PSA):
Amae serves as the outpatient SMI arm – at no cost to the health system

Preferred Referral Relationships

Benefits both national health systems and academic medical centers

X

*CMS Hospital Star Rating - 22% of Star ratings are re-admissions. Higher Star ratings result in higher reimbursements from CMS.

Testimonials

“I am grateful to Amae Health for the transformation I've witnessed over the past year. With Dr. Scott Fears' guidance, our son has found ways to live with and even to overcome many of the challenges he’s been facing. He values the insights Dr. Fears brings to their conversations. 

Our son has committed to the medication regimen and the recommendations he’s received—from dietary adjustments to engaging in community activities, social interactions, and physical fitness. 

The Amae caregiver meetings, especially the family support sessions led by Dr. Gary Tsai, have amplified our empathy for others in similar situations and has fostered hope.

We thank the clinic for their care and for making such a positive impact on our lives.”

Testimonials

“I’m a sister of a member at Amae. I felt immediate relief from the beginning of our first visit to their facility. The staff is incredibly supportive, caring, and immediately follows up when needed. This is unfortunately rare in the mental health field. 

Though it’s only been less than two months since my brother has joined Amae, I’ve noticed significant improvement in his overall well-being. For the first time, my brother has accepted that he needs help and is willing and eager to continue to do the work at Amae. We’re beyond grateful for the staff at Amae, and I’m excited for him to continue to stay on the right path.”

The Amae Difference

PHP in Person for SMI

Key Takeaways

Amae is an in-person value-based long-term care provider for SMI.

Integrated VBC

Long-Term Provider

Highly profitable
High CAC + inflexible and short term care in PHP structure

Better outcomes and profitability
Not available in SMI to date

c

Low quality; Required to provide care for anyone who requests care for mental health or substance use, regardless of ability to pay

PHPs that are often PE backed are highly fragmented and a small part of the care journey
Odyssey Behavioral Health
NewPort Academy: 1.3B deal by Onyx Partners
Refresh Mental Health: 1.2B Acquisition by Optum

Carebridge: in home care, >$1B val. in 2 years
Oak Street Health: value-based primary care for Medicare, $10B acq.
Somatus: value-based kidney care, $2.5B val.
Main street: Rural primary care, $315M round
Landmark: complex chronic disease provider, $5.4B acq.

Non-profit Community Mental Health Centers/Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics 
FQHCs

Our program has an actual SOLUTION for the problem - we deliver outcomes, and therefore have  0 CAC and high margins. We partner across both health systems and health plans to deliver value throughout the healthcare system. 

Amae’s insight is that by being longterm provider solve problem for health systems and are able to get referrals for no CAC. By integrating VBC contracts we have higher TAM than if operating just as short-term in-person SMI care provider like PHP
