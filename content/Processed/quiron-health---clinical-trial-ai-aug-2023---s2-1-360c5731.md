## Slide 1: AI Clinical Simulation to Eliminate Human Controls in Phase 3 Clinical Trials

AI CLINICAL SIMULATION TO ELIMINATE
HUMAN CONTROLS IN PHASE 3 CLINICAL TRIALS

## Slide 2: Human control groups in Phase 3 clinical trials create challenges for everyone – patients, pharma, and regulators

Human control groups in Phase 3 clinical trials create challenges
for everyone – patients, pharma, and regulators

*   **The #1 reason patients reject or drop out of trials is the fear of being assigned to the control group**
*   **Patient recruitment & retention costs $20M+ per trial and fear of control is the #1 driver of delays and failures**
*   **Every year of delay costs $2.6B+ in missed revenue opportunity and 10% - 20% of patent life**

We finally have the data and tools to eliminate human controls – we can use
AI to build digital patients with clinical accuracy and real-world variability to
save lives, reduce costs, and bring therapies to market faster

## Slide 3: Humans are condemned to suffer in control groups

Humans are condemned to suffer in control groups

**Mariano was diagnosed with ALS at 38 years old.**

In 2021, Mariano entered a Phase III Randomized Clinical Trial (RCT) for an investigative new drug

*   After 1 year in the trial, many participants experienced reduced symptoms...
    *   These patients were randomly assigned to the treatment group and received an efficacious drug
*   Mariano's condition worsened
    *   Mariano was randomly assigned to the control group

**Today, Mariano is fully paralyzed.**
**There are thousands of people like Mariano each year.**
**This is completely avoidable using technology.**

## Slide 4: Trial sponsors want to reduce costs AND get to market faster

Trial sponsors want to reduce costs AND get to market faster
(it is all about time)

**Fear of being assigned to control is the leading cause of recruitment failure and delays for trials**

...amplified when prognosis is poor or the standard of care is not effective

Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.
46% of survey respondents said fear of assignment to placebo was the leading cause of rejecting participation in a clinical trial

**This is a massive financial problem impacting as much as 80% of all trials**

*   Only 9% of Phase III clinical trials reach market
*   $10M+ expenses per year of a study and recruitment is the largest budget item
*   <50% patent life remaining after trials complete
*   $2B+ of revenue at risk per year of delay

Every month counts

## Slide 5: The industry is demanding a solution

The industry is demanding a solution
(we've interviewed them and we've been in their shoes for 20+ years)

**Chief, Division of Internal Medicine**
Top 20 Academic Hospital System

"Clinical trials are too expensive, too slow, and too cumbersome. There are many instances where the quality and standard of care provided to patients in a trial is appalling. A technology like Quiron that could reduce or eliminate human participation in randomized control trials could alleviate many of these issues.”

**SVP, Clinical Development**
Top 20 Publicly Traded Pharma Company

"The presence of AI in clinical trials is gaining momentum. The use of in-silico trials to accelerate drug development is sorely needed. The time is right to explore an opportunity like Quiron."

...and the FDA is beginning to listen and approve new technologies

**Former CDER Director**
Janet Woodcock

"FDA will work with its stakeholders to understand how RWE can best be used to increase ... efficiency of clinical research and answer questions that may not have been answered [in the trial]...”
