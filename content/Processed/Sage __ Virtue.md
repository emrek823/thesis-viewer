### Current Product & Technical Status

- Getting MVP out with unauthorized integrations to crappy 25-year-old systems like WellSky
	- More tech team digs into underlying structure, more they discover how idiosyncratic and broken these platforms are
	- Technical debt prevents legacy systems from innovating but makes interoperability challenging
- Q4 scorecard on track to ship MVP
	- Initial build complete, testing internally
	- App Store submission in progress, awaiting responses to additional information requests
	- Target: design partners using product week of December 8th
- iOS native app chosen over React Native or desktop-first approach
	- Desktop app planned for early next year
	- Android not highly requested by target users
- Initial product focused on client intake workflows rather than scheduling/staffing
	- VoIP telephony system with CRM and Wellsky integrations
	- AI records calls, generates post-call recommendations (add CRM records, send emails, update care plans)
	- Quantitative value prop: save 100 minutes per client intake
	- Target users: agency owner operators, not caregivers

### Customer Acquisition & Growth Strategy

- Nervous about ability to find scalable acquisition channels that will really accelerate growth
- By end of Q1 goal: 50 active organizations on platform (ambitious but achievable)
- Current successful channels leveraging existing network and warm intros
	- 5 organizations signed up for December launch (limiting to 5 for quality experience)
	- 12 agencies on waitlist
	- Not scalable long-term due to limited connections
- Other channels being explored:
	- SEO/inbound content generation (saw real traffic to Clara site 6-12 months after investment)
	- Email-gated resources (playbooks, runbooks, best practices guides)
	- Industry webinars and brand awareness through existing channels
	- Conference presence at state/local/regional agency conventions
- Creative acquisition ideas:
	- HIPAA-compliant care plan generator (agencies currently hacking care plans using ChatGPT, which bosses know isn’t compliant)
	- Free TB tests for caregivers (similar to successful strategy used by benefits company)
- $0 spent on marketing since pivot - waiting for product traction before paid advertising

### Pricing & Revenue Strategy

- Target agencies are cash-constrained (consider anything >$5/month expensive per home care consultant)
- Pricing approach: ~$90/month (~$1,000 annual ARR per agency)
	- 50 agencies = $50K revenue (not moving needle but demonstrates willingness to pay)
	- Strategy: give early cohorts good value pricing, expand pricing for future cohorts
- Path to higher revenue:
	- Replace existing telephony providers (customer paying $85/month to RingCentral could switch entirely)
	- Replace human roles ($50K client intake specialist or $6/hour Philippines assistant)
	- Franchise network distribution (get franchisees using product, then franchisor adoption)
	- Eventually target enterprise (learning from CareSwitch cautionary tale - they got 400 small agencies year 1 but struggled with enterprise pivot and were acquired in distressed sale)
- Long-term vision: take initial wedge and grow it over 5-10 years through multiple expansion paths
