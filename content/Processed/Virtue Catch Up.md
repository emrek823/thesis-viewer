### Pitch Deck Feedback & Structure

- First 10 slides are “total fat” - targeting sophisticated $20-50M investor audience
- Cut to the chase: buried lead until slide 27 with actual pitch content
- Restructure as executive summary with 5 key bullets:
	- Building TAP 2.0 with AI at this moment in time
	- Anna demonstrates multisite playbook + AI wrapper capabilities
	- Owner of residual value delta vs. software vendor pricing
	- Clear 24-month execution plan with hiring strategy
	- “Big dick swinging” - establish credibility as the person to build this

### Business Model & Economics

- Anna trajectory showing outstanding unit economics
	- $200K investment generates $1M+ cash flow (10x return)
	- Cash flow stream worth 10x = 100x total return
	- AI improvements push margins to 150x+ returns
- Hold co/op co structure advantages:
	- Own full value creation vs. just software dollars
	- Build vs. buy strategy: $388K input for $1.2M cash flow worth $18M
	- Competitors pay 15x multiples while building at fraction of cost
- Capital efficiency model like TAP’s original structure using founders’ SCA sale proceeds

### Strategic Positioning & Narrative

- “Why now” evolution: pediatric autism model → AI-native care delivery 2.0
- Differentiated from existing TAP model through AI integration and tech stack
- Provocative positioning: not for everyone, target 50% who get excited quickly
- Price maker vs. price taker dynamic - own underlying asset appreciation
- Continuous hedge: valuations up = portfolio value increases, valuations down = cheaper acquisition opportunities

### Next Steps

- Aimun to draft memo format instead of deck (tonight delivery)
- Sean and Emre feedback session tomorrow for dry run
- Three pre-Health+ meetings scheduled for preemptive conversations
- “Don’t hold back” on feedback quality - prioritize getting narrative right over speed
- Virtue analysis of competitive landscape and positioning
