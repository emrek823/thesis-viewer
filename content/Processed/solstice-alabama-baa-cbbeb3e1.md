# BUSINESS ASSOCIATE AGREEMENT

THIS HIPAA BUSINESS ASSOCIATE AGREEMENT (the "Agreement") is hereby entered into by and between Birmingham Hematology and Oncology Associates, L.L.C. d/b/a Alabama Oncology ("Covered Entity") and **Solstice Health, Inc.** ("Business Associate") and is effective as of the **16th** day of **May** 20**23** ("Effective Date"). Covered Entity and Business Associate may each be referred to herein as a "Party" and collectively as the "Parties."

## WITNESSETH:

WHEREAS, Business Associate may provide certain services to Covered Entity, which may require Covered Entity to disclose certain information to Business Associate constituting Protected Health Information ("PHI");

WHEREAS, if and only to the extent that Covered Entity discloses PHI to Business Associate, the provisions of this Agreement will come into effect and the parties will protect the privacy and provide for the security of PHI disclosed to Business Associate in compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, Public Law 104-191, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (collectively, "HIPAA") and privacy and security regulations promulgated thereunder as amended from time to time (the "HIPAA Regulations") and other applicable laws; and

WHEREAS, the purpose of this Agreement is to set forth the requirements necessary to satisfy certain standards and requirements of HIPAA and the HIPAA Regulations, including, but not limited to, Title 45, Section 164.504(e) of the Code of Federal Regulations.

NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows:

A. **Definitions.** Unless otherwise specified in this Agreement, all capitalized terms used herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the HIPAA Regulations.

B. **Stated Purpose for which Business Associate May Use or Disclose PHI.** The Parties hereby agree that except as otherwise limited in this Agreement, Business Associate shall be permitted to use or disclose PHI provided or made available from Covered Entity to perform any function, activity or service for, or on behalf of, Covered Entity as specified in a separate writing, or otherwise a services agreement, provided that such use or disclosure would not violate the HIPAA Regulations if done by Covered Entity. Business Associate may also permanently de-identify and use PHI provided that such de-identification is performed strictly in compliance with the HIPAA Regulations.

C. **Business Associate Obligations.** Business Associate covenants and agrees that it shall:

(1) Not use or further disclose PHI other than as permitted or required under this Agreement or as required by applicable law or regulation.

(2) Implement the administrative, physical and technical safeguards set forth in 45 C.F.R § 164.302-318 and otherwise reasonably and appropriately protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the electronic PHI that it creates, receives, maintains or transmits on behalf of Covered Entity and to use appropriate safeguards to prevent the use or disclosure of PHI other than as permitted under this Agreement.

(3) Use appropriate safeguards to maintain the security of and prevent unauthorized access to Covered Entity's PHI. Such safeguards will include a written information security program.

(4) Require any of its agents or subcontractors, or other third parties with which Business Associate does business that are provided PHI or electronic PHI on behalf of Covered Entity, to agree, in writing, to adhere to the same restrictions and conditions on the use and disclosure of PHI that apply to Business Associate under this Agreement.

(5) To the extent Business Associate maintains PHI in a Designated Record Set, make available to Covered Entity upon written request from Covered Entity, such information as is necessary to fulfill Covered Entity's obligations to provide PHI: (a) pursuant to an Individual's right to obtain a copy of his or her PHI under 45 C.F.R. § 164.524(a); and (b) that may be related to an Individual's right to amend his or her PHI under 45 C.F.R. § 164.526. Business Associate will track disclosures and make available to Covered Entity information that may be required for Covered Entity to provide an accounting of disclosures pursuant to 45 C.F.R. § 164.528. In the event of a request by an individual directly to Business Associate for an accounting, Business Associate will provide such an accounting in accordance with regulations and standards adopted by the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (the "Secretary"). Business Associate shall also, as directed by Covered Entity, incorporate any amendments to PHI into copies of such PHI maintained by Business Associate.

(6) Make available to the Secretary all internal practices, books and records relating to the use and disclosure of PHI received from, or created by, Business Associate on behalf of Covered Entity, for purposes of determining Covered Entity's or Business Associate's compliance with the HIPAA Regulations. The Parties' respective rights and obligations under this Section C (6) shall survive termination of the provision of services or a separate agreement.

(7) During the term of the provision of services or any separate agreement, notify Covered Entity of any suspected or actual Breach of Unsecured PHI, Security Incident, or unauthorized use or disclosure of PHI and/or any actual or suspected use or disclosure of data in violation of any applicable federal or state laws or regulations. Notice may be supplemented as facts become available and will include, to the extent known, the identification of each individual whose Unsecured PHI has been or is reasonably believed by Business Associate to have been accessed, acquired or disclosed during such Breach and other information necessary for Covered Entity to fulfill any Breach notification obligations. Notice to Covered Entity will be provided to:

Chris Barnes, Executive Director
500 Office Park Drive
Birmingham, AL 35223
chris.barnes@alabamaoncology.com
(205)-296-6444

(8) Disclose to its subcontractors, agents or other third parties, and request from Covered Entity, only the minimum PHI necessary, in Business Associate's judgment, to perform or fulfill a specific function required or permitted by this Agreement.

D. **Permitted Uses and Disclosures.** Business Associate agrees that it shall not use or disclose PHI in any manner, form, or in any means that is contrary to its obligations under this Agreement or any separate agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties agree that pursuant to federal law, Business Associate may:

(1) Use PHI in its possession for its proper management and administration and to fulfill any of its present or future legal responsibilities provided that such uses are permitted under state and federal confidentiality laws.

(2) Disclose PHI in its possession to third parties for the purpose of its proper management and administration or to fulfill any of its present or future legal responsibilities provided that (i) the disclosures are required by law, as provided for in 45 C.F.R. § 164.501, or (ii) Business Associate has received from the third party written assurances that the PHI will be held confidentially, that the PHI will only be used or further disclosed as required by law or for the purpose for which it was disclosed to the third party, and that the third party will notify Business Associate of any instances of which it is aware in which the confidentiality of the information has been breached, as required under 45 C.F.R. § 164.504(e)(4).

(3) Use PHI in its possession to provide data aggregation services relating to the health care operations of the Covered Entity.

(4) Use PHI to create data that is de-identified pursuant to the standards set forth at 45 C.F.R. §164.502(d) for Business Associates' internal and/or commercial purposes.

E. **Termination.** Notwithstanding any other provision under a service agreement or separate writing and pursuant to federal law, Business Associate agrees that the provision of services or separate writing may be terminated by Covered Entity should Covered Entity determine that Business Associate has violated a material term of this Agreement.

F. **Return or Destruction of PHI.** Upon termination, cancellation, or expiration of any services or a separate agreement, if feasible, Business Associate shall return to Covered Entity or destroy in accordance with standards promulgated by the Secretary, any and all PHI received from, or created by, Business Associate on behalf of Covered Entity that is maintained by Business Associate in any form. Should the return or destruction of the PHI be determined by Business Associate, in its sole discretion, to be infeasible, the Parties agree that the terms of this Agreement shall extend to the PHI until otherwise indicated by Covered Entity, and any further use or disclosure of the PHI by Business Associate shall be limited to that purpose which renders the return or destruction of the PHI infeasible.

G. **Amendment to Comply with Law.** The Parties acknowledge that state and federal laws relating to electronic data security and privacy are rapidly evolving and that amendment of this Agreement may be required to ensure compliance with such developments. Specifically, HITECH, as implemented by the HIPAA Omnibus Rule (78 Fed. Reg. 5566 (January 25, 2013)), imposes new requirements on business associates and covered entities with respect to privacy, security and breach notification. Applicable HIPAA and HITECH provisions, together with any guidance issued by the Secretary, and any applicable amendments to federal and state privacy law, are hereby incorporated by reference and will become part of this Agreement as if set forth in their entirety, effective as of the applicable effective date/s.

H. **No Third Party Beneficiaries.** Nothing express or implied in the Agreement is intended to confer, nor shall anything herein confer, upon any person other than Covered Entity, Business Associate, and their respective successors or assigns, any rights, remedies, obligations, or liabilities whatsoever.

I. **Term.** This Agreement shall become effective on the Agreement Effective Date and shall expire when all of the PHI provided by Covered Entity to Business Associate is destroyed or returned to Covered Entity pursuant to Section F. The Parties agree that Sections B, C, and D of the Agreement shall survive the termination or expiration of any separate writing or definitive service agreement.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties have caused this Agreement to be signed and delivered by their duly authorized representatives, as of the Effective Date.
