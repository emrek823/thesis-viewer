## Slide 4: Problem
### Healthcare data teams waste $1M+ annually wrestling with fragmented, low-quality data

**Healthcare data pain points:**
1.  Multiple sources: Claims, EHR, HIE, Labs
2.  Multiple formats: CSV, JSON, XML, DB, PDF
3.  Persistent quality issues: Missing, invalid, duplicate, referential, implausible values
4.  Missing analytics-ready features

**Result:** Teams spend **80% of time** cleaning vs. analyzing while wasting **$1M+ per year** in resources.

## Slide 5: Problem
### How do you go from 1 million+ codes to analytics-ready concepts?

**Codes (Input):**
*   SNOMED-CT
*   ICD-10
*   LOINC
*   NDC
*   RxNorm
*   HCPCS
*   Place of Service
*   Revenue Center
*   Bill Type
*   Etc...

**Analytics-Ready Concepts (Output):**
*   Care Settings
*   Provider Specialties
*   Services
*   Conditions
*   Procedures
*   Encounters
*   Episodes
*   Preventable Events
*   Care Transitions
*   Etc...

## Slide 6: Solution
### Tuva: An open-source platform that transforms raw data into analytics-ready insights

**Normalized**
Common schema unifies claims, EHR, HIE, and lab data

**Quality-tested**
100+ automated atomic and analytic quality tests

**Enriched**
1000+ pre-built clinical concepts enrich raw data for analytics

**Diagram:**
1.  **Raw data sources** (represented by servers and databases) feed into
2.  **Tuva Data Model** (represented by the TuvaHealth logo with a wave icon)
3.  Which then leads to **Advanced analytics** (represented by a dashboard with graphs and charts)

## Slide 7: Why Open-Source
### Open-source disrupts build vs. buy paradigm for healthcare data platform customers

**Build**
*   **Slow:** Can take years (we've spent 30,000+ hours building Tuva so far).
*   **Complex:** Internal teams struggle to hire and retain necessary domain experts to build internally.

**Hybrid**
*   **Fast:** Go from raw claims and clinical data to advanced analytics in an afternoon.
*   **Full Control:** All code runs inside the customer's cloud, giving them full control of their data and the data model.
*   **Transparent:** Customer has access to all code, allowing them to reconcile to external reporting, which is critical for building trust in the data.
*   **Logo:** TUVAHealth

**Buy**
*   **No Control:** Customer sends their data to vendor, limiting their ability to customize the data model for their unique needs.
*   **Black-box:** Customer has no access to underlying code, making it impossible to reconcile to external reporting.

## Slide 10: Case Study
### MultiCare is thrilled to adopt Tuva for its speed, customization, and transparency.

**Why they are adopting Tuva:**
*   **Speed:** Takes months to ingest and transform data into analytics on current platforms
*   **Control:** Current platforms have limited ability to customize data model to meet their needs
*   **Transparency:** Struggled to validate reporting and data quality due to lack of transparency of black box data models

**MultiCare H**
*   **~380 k** Members
*   **~$700 k** Year-1 Contract

**Quote:**
"Tuva is a key investment into MultiCare's ability to succeed in VBC."

AVP Population Health and Value-based Care

## Slide 11: Go To Market
### Open-source enables unique GTM motion by tapping into healthcare data + analytics user base

1.  **Untapped User Base**
    Healthcare data and analytics engineers lack any sort of tools or community to support them – this is precisely who we are building for.
    These individuals can access and use Tuva's open-source tools instantly, without signing a contract or BAA.
    Our competitors build black-box solutions that cut-out the engineer rather than enable them.

2.  **Enterprise Adoption**
    Our users evangelize Tuva within their organization, leading the organization to adopt the open-source as their enterprise data model.
    They start mapping all of their data sources into the Tuva Data Model, and build dashboards, reporting, and analytics on top of it, creating a huge dependency on the open-source.

3.  **Closed-Source Products**
    Eventually the organization runs into common problems the open-source doesn't solve, leading them to adopt our closed-source products to solve these challenges.
    These are existing products in the market, however, customers will prefer Tuva versions of these products because they integrate seamlessly with the open-source and run inside the customer's cloud (no data needs to leave).

## Slide 12: Traction
### Our unique GTM motion is working and disrupting incumbents

*   **patina.**
    The Patina data team loves Tuva. In early 2024 they adopted Tuva as their analytics data model for claims and clinical data, replacing a previous vendor in favor of building in-house. Since then they've made multiple important contributions to the open-source, especially in the areas of CMS-HCC risk scores, and are active members in the community.

*   **MultiCare**
    MultiCare discovered Tuva in Q1 2024 after deciding to sunset their existing data platform vendor. They immediately understood the open-source would accelerate their build by years. This quickly led to a large commercial partnership. We are now helping them implement the open-source as well as develop custom analytics on top of it. They have contracted to be an alpha customer for EMPI and are very interested in adopting other closed-source product like Benchmarking.

*   **Care About HEALTH**
    Care About discovered Tuva in mid-2024 and quickly decided to replace Innovaccer with Tuva as their healthcare data platform. Key to Care About is the ability to customize the data model to meet their needs and the ability to have full control of and transparency into data pipelines. They are interested to add both EMPI and NCQA HEDIS Measures closed-source products when they are released.

*   **waymark**
    The Waymark team discovered Tuva in early 2024 and immediately decided to adopt the data model. They now use Tuva to normalize their disparate claims feeds from MMCOs. At Waymark the Tuva Data Model is used by finance, actuary, and clinical teams for reporting and analytics. They have even published peer reviewed articles using the Tuva Data Model. Waymark is interested to add NCQA HEDIS Measures when they are released in Q2 2025.

## Slide 13: Vision
### Imagine the entire world's healthcare data in the exact same analytics-ready data model

**Come for the tools, stay for the network**
Initially, users and organizations adopt Tuva for the unique value it unlocks for them.
However, as more and more organizations adopt Tuva, additional value is unlocked via reusable and comparative analytics.

**Reusable Analytics**
As organizations publish research studies and analyses on Tuva, the code behind these studies is completely reusable, i.e. it will run on any Tuva dataset.
Imagine a future where the average payer or provider can run thousands of high-quality, clinically-validated analyses on their data out-of-the-box.
This unlocks insights that weren't possible before, simply because the payer or provider didn't have the time to do the analysis from scratch.

**Comparative Analytics**
Beyond reusable code, payers and providers can directly compare the results of any analysis because the underlying methods are identical.
This enables a learning healthcare network, where payers and providers can collaborate around data to identify clinical best practices.
