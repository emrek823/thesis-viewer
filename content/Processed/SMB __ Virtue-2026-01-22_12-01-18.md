### Commercial Updates & Pipeline Progress

- JPM conference outcomes
	- AstraZeneca bullish on Tempest partnership
	- Ryan Fukushima leading Foundation models initiative
	- BMS discussions progressing well for RIA internal perspective
	- Sanofi meeting positive, calling out SMB’s work
- Current pipeline status
	- Sanofi targeting March-April signature (Galen confirmation)
	- BMS deal positioning SMB contra-Tempest but with strong differentiation
	- Potential Novartis opportunity through Galen’s wife
	- Mayo Clinic exploring Concert AI partnership with access to Mayo data
	- UK Minister of Health meeting scheduled next Tuesday

### Academic Medical Center Strategy

- Target: 10 AMCs publishing on SMB model by end of Q2
- Current momentum
	- UCSD: Aaron Busina responding positively, cost-sharing storage for data access
	- Stanford: New faculty member engaged, 2-month follow-up scheduled
	- MSK: Reached out for continued partnership post-IHUB shutdown (end Feb)
		- Lunch and learn with large language models oncology outcomes lab
		- Proposal will include persistent data access and public partnership language
- Approach evolution
	- Focus on overwhelmed new faculty with tight deadlines
	- Leverage data access as value proposition where possible
	- Push toward institutional-level integration beyond individual PIs

### Real World Data Vendor Landscape

- Market trend: Every RWD company positioning as “AI forward”
- Emerging opportunities
	- Biorepository startup from JPM: Train on their data, provide foundation model access
	- Century Health, Protege, new YC companies all AI-native but primarily data aggregators
- Strategic questions around incumbent displacement
	- Protege success vs Flatiron positioning unclear
	- Market timing creating space for data brokers with $10M+ lab budgets

### Go-to-Market Hiring Priority

- Commercial lead hiring critical for next 9 months
	- Profile 1: Weights & Biases complex sales lead (tools to life sciences, buyer ≠ user experience)
	- Profile 2: Ex-pharma BD/CBO from platform drug discovery companies (Chimera example)
- Team structure evolution
	- Kevin leading pharma relationships, transitioning to Eric for polish
	- Danielle taking over AMC outreach as existing contacts exhausted
	- Eric handling other vendor relationships
- Commercial sophistication gap
	- Strong at initial meetings, weaker at deal mechanics/progression
	- Need 9-month deal timeline expertise for Series A readiness

### Technical Architecture & Product Vision

- Core thesis validation
- Distribution strategy
	- LLM wrapper approach successful but becoming commoditized
	- Claude can now code SMB model fine-tuning in one shot
	- Multimodal advantage over OpenAI’s text-native RL pipeline
- Target publications
	- MSK work expanded: Imaging + pathology + whole genome + longitudinal EHR
	- Genomics encoder completion for oncology biomarker design
- Data acquisition focus
	- Gradient relationship providing cheap image access
	- ARPA-H initiative: 10% US patient data availability (VA-heavy)
	- Accelerator partnerships for cost-effective access over major biobank purchases

### Financing & Next Steps

- $2.5M investment from Virtue (increased from $2M range)
- Wire timing: Docs today, funding next week from two vehicles
- Hiring acceleration
	- Ubin and Lavender profiles approved for immediate offers
	- Commercial hire as highest priority for Series A positioning
- Regular touchpoints: Every 2-3 weeks for mission-critical milestone tracking
- Series A preparation: Transform from “scrappy seed startup” to “solid core of all-stars”
