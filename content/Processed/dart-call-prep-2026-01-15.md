# Dart Call Prep — Jan 15, 2026

## What We Now Know (From Veeraj's Written Responses)

### Oncology Pivot — Explained
Dropped because orgs couldn't differentiate from OpenEvidence/Doximity fast enough, ROI felt ambiguous. Also cited OpenAI/Anthropic launches crowding space. Still consider it a future expansion use case.

### AI Data Analyst Differentiation — Clarified
**The pitch:** Innovaccer/Health Catalyst = basic SQL search on dashboards. Dart captures decision traces that exist only in emails/conversations (e.g., "what definition of LOS?" or "what's extreme glucose?"). This context layer lets AI complete end-to-end analysis like a clinical operations leader.

TextQL doesn't support care providers directly (API/SDK only), no custom tool calling, no context layer.

### Financials Updated
- **ARR:** $1.2M (after $400K/8 customers intentionally churned)
- **Churn rationale:** Focus on enterprise ($100M+/yr customers) with internal resources and depth intent

### Pipeline Details — Kelly's Book

| Account | Stage | ACV |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Graham Healthcare ($GHC) | Early→Mid | $600K |
| VITAS (largest US hospice) | Early | $650K |
| CommonSpirit Health at Home | Early | $250K |
| UNC Health System | Early→Mid | $150K |
| Brooks Rehab | Mid (paused Q2) | $150K |
| Addus ($ADUS) | Early | ~$500K |

**Total Kelly pipeline: $2M+**

Lost Advent (build vs buy), pivoted Albany/ECU to new AI Data Analyst wedge.

### Hiring — Realistic Timeline
- **Head of Eng:** Start Q2
- **Head of Success:** Start Q2
- **Head of Commercial:** Start Q3

### Technical Progress
- Inference cost **down 50%** (Gemini $343 vs Sonnet $700)
- **100k reviews/week** (vs 2M total in Aug)
- Processing **6x faster** than 3 months ago
- Deployment: **6mo → 3mo** (2x improvement)

### Context Moat — Quantified
- **6,000+ rules** for home health/hospice
- **40% rule reuse** across enterprises
- **60% use case reuse** per business line
- **6+ months** to replicate (after tech built)

## Open Questions for Today's Call

### 1. Status Check
- Did CHAP close? (Was $375K at board approval in Dec)
- Care Hospice $400K? (Also late stage in Dec)
- Beth Israel, Marin Health, Jackson Memorial? (Mentioned Dec 9)

### 2. Hospital Strategy
Aakruti running solo. Zero logos. 15 @ $300K target.
- What's the first hospital we're trying to close? Timeline?
- Do they need health system intros now, or wait for clearer playbook?

### 3. Virtue Support — What's Useful Now?
- We offered: John Driscoll, Nashville ecosystem, Multicare/TGH/UT Southwestern/Kaiser/Cedars intros, NYC sales talent
- **Ask:** What would move the needle this quarter?

### 4. Kelly's Pipeline Quality
$2M+ in 4 weeks is impressive. What converts in Q1?
- Graham (Tony Ott) seems furthest along
- VITAS would be a massive logo

### 5. CHAP as Channel
The briefing flagged this is underexploited. Are they negotiating:
- Co-marketing rights?
- Referral structure?
- Warm intro targets?

## Key Themes to Reinforce

**What's working:**
- Customer discipline (cutting $400K was hard but right)
- Kelly activation speed
- Infrastructure efficiency gains (50% cost reduction, 6x speed)
- Context moat is real (6,000 rules, quantified reuse)

**What needs watching:**
- Hospital playbook still forming (Aakruti solo, no logos)
- Senior hires delayed (Q2-Q3 starts)
- Pipeline conversion rate unknown

## Virtue Offers on the Table

| Need | We Can Help With |
|------|------------------|
| Hospital intros | Multicare, TGH, UT Southwestern, Kaiser, Cedars |
| Post-acute channel | John Driscoll, Nashville ecosystem |
| Recruiting | NYC sales talent, Jay Desai network, exec search firms |
| Government (if relevant) | Palantir network, HHS contacts |

## Bottom Line for Call

Veeraj's responses resolved the key concerns we had. The oncology pivot makes sense. The AI Data Analyst differentiation is clear. The context moat is quantifiable.

**Main agenda items:**
1. Deal status (CHAP, Care Hospice, hospital pipeline)
2. What Virtue help is most useful now
3. Q1 milestones to track
