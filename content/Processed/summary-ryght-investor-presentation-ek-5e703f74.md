## Slide 4: Problem

RIGHT.
70% of sites fail due to upstream issues in site selection and activation. Failed
studies cost up to $2B

| Category       | PROTOCOL OPTIMIZATION           | STUDY FUNDING                  | CRO SELECTION                               | SITE IDENTIFICATION                          | SITE SELECTION                                        | SITE ACTIVATION                            |
| :------------- | :-------------------------------- | :----------------------------- | :------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------- |
| **Sponsors & CROs** | Hard to predict downstream effects of changes | Funding trials relies on risky guess work | Verifying CRO capabilities for a protocol is difficult | Identifying the best sites is not data driven. | Fax and PDF requests have low response rate and wrong sites are chosen | Activation is manual, time intensive and costly. |
| **Sites**      | Bad protocols fail                | Bad trials impact IIT funding  | The wrong CRO impacts patient enrollment faster   | Sites activate studies with too little data and fail   | Sites hate replying to long redundant forms    | Admin overhead to start the wrong trials is a waste |

## Slide 12: ROI: ID and activate better sites faster

RIGHT.
We can drive $5M+ in savings for one small rare disease trial (n= 6)

**OLD SCHOOL**
*   **Sponsor** hires **CRO**
*   **CRO** performs **Old feasibility process**
*   This leads to **14 Sites activated, 4 sites enroll ALL the patients (29%)**
    *   Diagram shows 14 buildings, only 4 with patient icons inside.
*   **Result:** **6 rare disease patients enrolled** (shown as 6 patient icons)

**RYGHT.**
*   **Sponsor** hires **CRO**
*   **CRO** uses **Ryght Agents**
*   **Ryght Agents** "Identify best sites, project patient counts, connect & activate"
*   This leads to **7 Sites activated faster (57% enroll)**
    *   Diagram shows 7 buildings, 4 with patient icons inside, representing a higher enrollment percentage among activated sites.
*   **Result:** **6 rare disease patients sooner** (shown as 6 patient icons in a shorter time frame)
*   **Outcome:** **Commence Phase III trial sooner** (globe icon)

**Timeline (shared for both Old School and Ryght):**
Old School path is longer. Ryght path is shorter, with earlier activation and patient enrollment.

## Slide 26: ROI: ID and activate better sites faster

RIGHT.
We can drive $5M+ in savings for one small rare disease trial (n= 6)

**OLD SCHOOL**
*   **Sponsor** hires **CRO**
*   **CRO** performs **Old feasibility process**
*   This leads to **14 Sites activated, 4 sites enroll ALL the patients (29%)**
    *   Diagram shows 14 buildings, only 4 with patient icons inside.
*   **Result:** **6 rare disease patients** (shown as 6 patient icons)

**RYGHT.**
*   **Sponsor** hires **CRO**
*   **CRO** uses **Ryght Apps**
*   **Ryght Apps** "Identify best sites, project patient counts, connect & activate"
*   This leads to **7 Sites activated, 4 sites enroll ALL the patients (57%)**
    *   Diagram shows 7 buildings, 4 with patient icons inside, representing a higher enrollment percentage among activated sites.
*   **Result:** **6 rare disease patients** (shown as 6 patient icons in a shorter time frame)

**Timeline (shared for both Old School and Ryght):**
Old School path is longer. Ryght path is shorter, with earlier activation and patient enrollment.

**Outcome from Ryght:**
*   **7 sites NOT activated $6 Million Saved**
*   **Patient yield INCREASING from 0.3 to 0.6 would cut 6 months off Phase I/II trial**
*   **Result: speed to completion at lower cost**

| **Problem** | Predicting enrollment potential from protocol changes. | Slow responses and low conversion to complex RFPs hurt business. | Identifying the best sites for a particular study is hard. Which region? AMC or community? What data do I buy to decide? | Emailing PDFs with questionnaires has a low response rate with no insight. 70% of sites fail to perform, meaning the wrong sites are selected. | Activation is manual, time intensive and costly.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Solution** | "Digital Twin" I/E and other changes to downstream recruitment. | IDs best sites and project patient counts for any protocol from CRO and Ryght network, then AI generates proposal draft. | Ryght AI provides a heat map of sites with real time data to determine the best sites, then provides a list for site feasibility.             | Ryght AI automates feasibility with AI agents identifying best sites, completing forms, then asking site workers to complete, validate, and commence contracting. | Ryght AI smart agents automate workflows for: - Site training - Document collection - SIV - EDC & eCRF setup - Supply chain readiness - Patient pre-screening                                                                      |

| **Problem** | **Community:** Have difficulty attracting studies for patients and revenue            | Sites have trouble deciding which trials to accept. Spreadsheet hell risks conflicts and resource bottlenecks.           | Sites hate printing and filling in repetitive questionnaires where patient counts seem to be the primary driver for fit.       | Sites struggle with understanding protocols, risk critical requirements, and can't quickly find information during patient visits. | Current trials are hard to find for local patients and referring physicians, risking enrollment targets                                                           |
|          | **AMCs:** Need help identifying which trials to take to optimize patient options and revenue |                                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                |                                                                                                                              |                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Solution** | Ryght Research Network increases exposure to new trials, optimizes trial mix (to reduce overlap and competition) and grows revenue. | Ryght AI analyzes protocols to identify fit against overlapping visit schedules, competing patient populations, and limited staff resources. | Ryght AI agents pick the best sites, populate forms, then ask site worker to validate, accept, and commence contracting. | Ryght AI smooths patient visits by visualizing & summarizing protocol info, visit schedules and compliance with and drives up protocol adherence.              | Ryght AI plugs into site's public website, allowing patients and physicians to "chat" with the site, easily find trials, and connect with the site co-ordinator in real-time |

## Slide 32: Problem

RIGHT.
70% of sites fail due to upstream issues in site selection and activation, causing $XB in waste
and delays.

**Diagram - Sponsor/CRO Experience (Top Half)**
*   **2-4 weeks over email to approve requests:** Feasibility form developed with 40+ questions
*   **~10% of sites have data for quality / performance "heatmap"**
*   **Time from contracting to site activation is 3 months**
*   **70% of sites fail**

**Flow for Sponsor/CRO Experience:**
1.  Emails survey to site list
2.  CRO collates replies, files PDFs
3.  Sites selected from basic patient data
4.  CRO contracts site

**Diagram - Site Experience (Bottom Half)**
*   **Time (Up to 6 months)**

**Flow for Site Experience:**
1.  Site prints questionnaire
2.  Answers redundant questions with handwritten replies
3.  (Implicitly leads to CRO contracts site)

**Problems with current process (listed on far right):**
*   Budget negotiation
*   Site training
*   Document collection
*   Document submission
*   Site initiation visit
*   EDC & eCRF setup
*   Supply chain readiness
*   Patient pre-screening
