**Bionic Health**
AI-Powered Preventive Healthcare

(Logo: Bionic Health - an hourglass symbol)

## Slide 2: Proactive, personalized preventive medicine guided by doctors, powered by AI

**Current Healthcare**
Disease Management

**Bionic Health**
Disease Prevention

Up to 40% of deaths in US each year are from preventable chronic diseases (CDC)
*   Vascular Disease
*   Cancer
*   Dementia
*   Metabolic Disease
*   Sarcopenia

## Slide 3: We leverage the AI Revolution to deliver Preventive Medicine at scale

The
**AI REVOLUTION**
in MEDICINE

GPT-4 AND BEYOND

Peter Lee | Carey Goldberg | Isaac Kohane
with Sébastian Bubeck
Foreword by OpenAI CEO, Sam Altman

We are building...
*   Over the next five years: Physician Co-Pilot
*   In five-to-ten years: FDA-Approved Autonomous Doctor

## Slide 4: Roadmap to Automating Preventive Care

Building a physician-in-the-loop AI system from the ground up for medical automation

**Clinic Operations**
*   **Custom EMR**
    Allows automation from start to finish
*   **Two-way Messaging**
    Empowers Asynchronous care with text, audio and video.

**Coach/Coordinator Support**
*   **Automated Intake** (health exchanges, QHIN)
    Patient's records pulled from all health records.
*   **Automated Accountability**
    Using smart virtual agents for customized accountability (LLMs)

**Clinician Automation**
*   **Automated Diagnosis and Treatments**
    Using ML, LLMs and rules-based algorithms.
    Custom EMR allows for rapid validation.
*   **Automated Administration**
    Note writing, order placing, staff coordination

**Clinician Communications**
*   **Clinician Playground**
    LLM with physician validation.
*   **AI-Doctor (human validated)**
    Response customized for the patients' preference (Text, Voice-Cloned, or Custom Clinician Avatar)

## Slide 5: Why Start with Preventive?

1.  Low risk environment to automate against compared to areas where split-second, life-and-death decisions are necessary (e.g. ER)
2.  Emphasis on diverse data collection (biomarkers, scans, wearables, etc.)
3.  A dearth of affordable and accessible preventive and longevity options on the market.

(Footer: Bionic Health logo)

## Slide 6: 3 Keys To Effective Preventive Medicine

1.  **Personalized**
    Unique health profiles: Utilizing your individual health data for tailored insights.
2.  **Predictive**
    Risk assessment: Advanced algorithms predicting potential health risks.
3.  **Proactive**
    Health action plans: Proactive strategies for medication, screening, exercise, and diet.

## Slide 7: 1. Bionic is Personalized

**Average ≠ Normal ≠ Optimal**

Traditional medicine treats diseased states based on population averages.
Bionic personalizes treatments to target optimal for you.

Jared Pelo, MD

BIONIC JOURNEY
Baseline Results

**Good**
OVERALL BIONIC PROGRESS

*   Chronic disease risk is better than average
*   Current health markers are lower than average

(Circular gauges with letter grades)
*   **B** VASCULAR HEALTH
*   **A** CANCER RISK
*   **C** HORMONE BALANCE

## Slide 8: 2. Bionic is Predictive

**Vascular Health**
Your Bionic Score: **B**

**KEY BIOMARKER**
ApoB (Apolipoprotein-B) – mg/dL
**33% Improved**

CURRENT: **91**
PREVIOUS: **100**
TARGET: **50**

**Strengths**
*   Overall lipid values are reasonable with total cholesterol less than 200.
*   Lipoprotein (a) is low which means you do not have a dangerous mutation.

**Areas to improve**
*   Aplipoprotein B is high at 91 optimal is less than 50.
*   LDL-P number puts you in borderline high risk.
*   LP IR score is 73, and optimal is 27.

(Footer: Bionic Health logo)

## Slide 9: 3. Bionic is Proactive

**Strengths**
*   Overall lipid values are reasonable with total cholesterol less than 200.
*   Lipoprotein (a) is low which means you do not have a dangerous mutation.

**Areas to improve**
*   Aplipoprotein B is high at 91 optimal is less than 50.
*   LDL-P number puts you in borderline high risk.
*   LP IR score is 73, and optimal is 27.

**Recommendations**
*   Start rosuvastatin 5 mg once a day to lower your risk for a cardiovascular event.
*   Start on Coenzyme Q10.
*   Start a beet root supplement for nitric oxide production.
*   Get a blood pressure monitor and check your blood pressure twice a day. Connect your cuff or upload your data after two weeks.
*   If you have 23andme or Ancestry, send it to us. Otherwise we'll look at this data when we get your genome.

**PHASE 1: Done**

*   Oversubscribed in just 3 months
*   50 active members (charging $125-250/month)
*   Migrated to 100% virtual after first 15 members
*   No churn

| Metric                    | Value            |
| :------------------------ | :--------------- |
| Corrective Health Changes | 100% of Members  |

## Slide 14: Scale Through B2B2C

**PHASE 3: To do**

Exploring several promising potential partners:
*   Healthcare Organizations
*   Large Employers
*   Gym Owners
*   Active Adult Communities
*   Insurance Carriers
*   Benefits Brokers
*   Value-based Care Organizations

(Footer: Bionic Health logo)

## Slide 15: Why Start with Direct to Consumer?

1.  To start our automation efforts immediately, we needed a workflow to build against, so we created our own based on experience taking care of over 20,000 patients.
2.  If we started B2B, we would still be waiting to get access to our first set of patient data. Currently, we have 50+ paying members using our system and sharing their data.
3.  By building for ourselves, we don't need FDA approval unlike if we were selling CDS software directly to other providers.
4.  Starting with D2C allows us to build a track record we can leverage when we go B2B2C.

## Slide 25: Financial Summary

**Current Model**
Two hours each of health coaching and physician services per patient annually at a cost of $400/patient. Revenue covers these costs, diagnostics, with a 20% margin.

**Automation Impact**
We're reducing both coaching and physician time to 30 minutes annually through automation, decreasing service expenses to $100/patient.

**Enhanced Margin**
This reduction in human resource time leads to cost savings and opportunity for an increased profit margin, even after accounting for technology investments.

**Scalability & Profitability**
Automation enables scalability and increased profitability as patient volumes increase, without proportional rise in operational costs.
