### 2026 Strategy & Focus Areas

- Converging on biotech + CDMO ecosystem as primary target
	- Most validation came from these sectors vs big pharma
	- Industry moving toward decentralized, specialized manufacturing
	- Collaboration between biotechs and CDMOs increasingly high-friction bottleneck
- Core value proposition: manufacturing execution platform solving biotech-CDMO information sharing
	- Biotechs need guaranteed delivery: right quantity, quality, timeline for trials
	- Batch failures (yield/quality issues) cause 6-9 month delays, $5-10M additional spend
	- Current reliance on third-party expertise creates control/visibility gaps

### Product Roadmap & Priorities

- Near-term focus: batch record review acceleration
	- PDF processing for searchability, commenting, exportability
	- AI agent first-pass issue detection (invalid equations, undocumented actions)
	- Currently takes 150+ hours for QA/QC teams to review
	- Several clinical biotechs interested in Q1 pilots
- Second horizon: process issue detection & optimization
	- Compare actual vs expected results from unit operations
	- Recommend platform process modifications based on product characteristics
	- Address real-time problems: “we’re not hitting purity targets - how do we fix this?”
- Longer-term biological innovation considerations
	- Manufacturability/developability predictions as molecule throughput increases 100x
	- Differentiate products based on manufacturing ease when safety/efficacy equal

### Commercial Strategy & Value Model

- Insurance-like model for near-term value creation
	- Reduce catastrophic batch failure probability from 20-40% to ~1%
	- Prevent 3-6 month trial delays and $5-10M manufacturing respends
- FDE consulting model for CDMO market entry
	- CDMOs software-negative but AI readiness consulting-positive
	- Entry point: help implement generative AI on top of existing QMS/MES systems
	- Generate learning, data, access for future platform applications
- Channel partnerships with CMC consulting agencies
	- Two-way flywheel combining Eitri platform + 20 years manufacturing experience
	- Joint process development offerings for biotechs with current problems

### 2026 Success Metrics & Next Steps

- Commercial targets:
	- Land 3-5 biotech batch review pilots, expand to follow-up use cases
	- Sell FDE consulting to 3-5 CDMOs (specialty and non-specialty)
	- Build two-sided platform presence: embedded with both biotechs and CDMOs
- Product milestones:
	- Complete batch record review pilots with biotechs
	- Add 2 additional product features post-pilot
	- Demonstrate land-and-expand within biotech accounts
- Quinn to send Q1 success definition and 2026 goals breakdown by end of week
