The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has a long history of using real-world data (RWD) and real-world evidence (RWE) to monitor and evaluate the postmarket safety of medical products and is committed to realizing the full potential of fit-for-use RWD to generate RWE that can advance the development of medical products and strengthen their oversight. The studies presented in the accompanying tables exemplify instances in which the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) and the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) applied RWE in regulatory decision-making processes since 2011. These include, but are not limited to, product approvals, labeling changes, and assessments that determined no regulatory action was warranted. This compilation forms part of a comprehensive landscape analysis to assess the scope and frequency of RWE use in regulatory determinations across the Agency.
