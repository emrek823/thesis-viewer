## Slide 2: Company Update Memo

# Company Update Memo
RIGHT
SI+E

Following our April 11th Investor Meeting, we focused on three priorities:

1.  Increasing Georgia EMS call volume with a re-invigorated account management program;
2.  Increasing our Blended Case Rate (“BCR”) by closing late-stage payor deals in Georgia; and,
3.  Analyzing and reducing our Cost/Episode.

These three variables define our business model and set our operational priorities:

**[Call Volume] X [BCR - Cost/Episode ] = Gross Profit**

With this formula in mind, here's how we did.

**Call Volume Update**

Call volume declined during Q1 because we strategically reduced EMS account management activity until signing more payer contracts.

We re-invigorated our EMS account management activity in Q2, focused on Georgia and Texas, and added net new volume from Grady Dispatch. The results are encouraging. The average trailing 9-business day call volume has increased from 16 to 24 calls per day from April to May, a 50% rise, with 25% coming from existing accounts and 75% coming from Grady Dispatch.

1.  **ADKAR Account Management Process:** A portion of the increase in call volume is due to re-implementing our "ADKAR" account management process with our partner EMS agencies. Here's an example of how we used the ADKAR process at SAFD: we identified a gap in the second "A" - Ability. The SAFD Dispatch Paramedics had "A"wareness, "D"esire, and the technical "K"nowledge to use RightSite. However, without a Clinical Operating Guideline issued by the EMS Medical Director, many did not feel they had the "A"bility to activate RightSite. We worked with the EMS Medical Director to issue this Clinical Guideline that defined when to call RightSite (similar to an SOP), removing ambiguity and providing clear direction on when and when not to activate RightSite. As a result, calls to RightSite increased.
2.  **Grady Dispatch Launch:** The remaining increase is from a new and important source for call volume - the launch of Grady Dispatch. We went live on May 8, and the launch has been smooth on the surface, with the usual on-the-fly learning lessons under the hood. Grady now uses RightSite upstream in dispatch and downstream with field/ambulance crews to divert non-emergent patients, providing a more holistic solution to EMS's capacity and cost problem. This holistic model is a crucial product positioning for

## Slide 3: Company Update Memo - Revenue Update - BCR

RightSite. We are the only vendor providing both dispatch and field services, wrapped with SDOH navigation.

We are dedicating most of our EMS account management time to increasing call volume in Georgia. We also have an MOU for Sandy Springs Fire (Atlanta Metro) for both field and dispatch, and Douglas County (Atlanta Metro) is seeking approval from the county in June to add dispatch to compliment our existing field service.

We continue to nurture our partnership with San Antonio Fire/EMS, where call volume is also growing. Meanwhile, the Jacksonville Fire/Rescue call volume remains stalled. While we are working on a launch in their dispatch center and re-training in the field, we are proceeding slowly in Jacksonville to avoid diverting resources from Georgia.

**Revenue Update - BCR**

Here's the calculation for RightSite's Blended Case Rate (BCR), which includes a $0 weighted allocation for uninsured patients:

**BCR = ∑ All Gov and Plan LOBs (FFS Rate + Case Rate) X % Payor Mix**

Currently, Georgia's BCR is $163.

We are in the final stages of negotiations with Aetna, CareSource and Humana, which should close in Q2, though some may extend into the next quarter. These deals will increase Georgia's current $163 BCR to $303, as follows:

*   Aetna + $60 (@ $1,000 case rate)
*   CareSource + $24 (@ $600 case rate)
*   Humana + $56 (@ $800 case rate)

These negotiations have taken longer because they moved to the corporate level instead of the local market team. However, once closed, these are enterprise-wide contracts covering all states where they have plan members.

We already have fee-schedule FFS contracts with Aetna, CareSource, and Humana. Adding the case rate component will disproportionately increase the BCR compared to the FFS amount. For example, the proposed Aetna MA FFS rate contributes $210 per episode to the BCR, while the case rate component adds $1,000 per episode, resulting in an Aetna BCR of $1,210. In this case, the FFS contribution is 17%, while the case rate makes up the remaining 83%.

## Slide 4: Company Update Memo - Cost/Episode & Finance - Revenue Cycle

# Company Update Memo

**Cost/Episode Update**

We are continuously working to reduce the Care Team's cost per episode. The Engineering team has released several updates to the RightSite Connect platform, streamlining tasks and improving documentation speed and accuracy. We also improved navigator and physician workflows for care delivery and revenue cycle tasks.

While there are still many areas for improvement, such as a more sophisticated division of tasks, refined SOPs and scripting, and the use of AI to reduce task time (pending increased engineering capacity), we are making steady progress.

Additionally, we measured and analyzed time-on-task for the entire navigator and doctor workflow. With more historical episode data, it was encouraging to see how closely the results aligned with the cost assumptions used in our last model.

Finally, we conducted our first employee NPS. With 100% participation, our eNPS was an amazing 93%. I attribute that squarely to our “F&R Culture”. We'll do a full walk through of our F&R process in a future board meeting as I consider it one of our durable competitive advantages.

**Finance - Revenue Cycle**

Our revenue cycle is getting tighter. So far, we've billed 479 claims with an allowable of $93,382 for dates of service through May 17, 2024. Going forward, we'll see an increasing flow of billed claims from increasing call volume and more signed payor contracts.

**Finance - Cash**

Our monthly spend is at or below forecast and our current cash on hand is $4.7MM. Our forecasted cash lasts to June 2025.

**Finance - Updated Forecast**

We are updating our financial model for the July 11th investor meeting, where we will delve into our Series A financing strategy. I'd like to share a preliminary look at the updated model, including the scenario conditions and the projected end-of-year (Dec-24) results.

*   **Scenario Assumptions**
    *   GA Call Volume: Increases from approximately 20 calls/day in May-24 to around 60 calls/day in Dec-24.
    *   GA BCR Growth: Grows from $163 in May-24 to $459 in Dec-24. This includes adding Aetna, CareSource, and Humana in Q2, United and Amerigroup Case Rates and BCBS-GA FFS in Q3, with no revenue from Blues, Cigna, and Kaiser for the remainder of the year (15% of payor mix).
    *   Texas and Florida Impact: Call volume and BCR in these states are expected to have minimal impact on revenue in Dec-24.
*   **Upside Scenarios Not Modeled**
    *   Higher than forecast EMS call volume from existing GA EMS agencies or new EMS agencies, despite a robust EMS pipeline.
    *   Increased call volume by adding weekend or extended hours.
    *   Case rates that come in sooner and/or higher than forecast.
*   **Notable for 2025**
    *   All Georgia Medicaid will transition to managed Medicaid, increasing our case rate capture by 13%.
*   **Preliminary Scenario Results at Dec-24**
    *   ARR Run Rate: $6.5M
    *   EBITDA Loss: $190K/month (approximately a 50% reduction from current burn rate)
    *   Ending Cash: $1.5M

Note: Case rates are a weighted average across all lines of business for that listed plan. Each LOB may close at different times, and so change the plan's listed case rate in this table.

Note: The blended case rate calculator is a dynamic projection that doesn't yet take into account a handful of things - like copays or how insurance status and payor mix evolves over time.

## Slide 17: Strategic Account Management Plans- EMS

# Strategic Account Management Plans- EMS
RIGHT
SI+E

This is the Account Management Dashboard for our EMS partners.

The dashboard helps us diagnose which agencies to focus on, and where to work within those agencies to increase volume. The ADKAR score (see the last row) indicates overall agency engagement, where 5 is best and 1 worst. Row 2 shows agency baseline call volume expectation. A combination of these two variables sets the account management prioritization (go to the accounts with the biggest opportunities requiring the least amount of work).

**MD&A**

Through Apr-24, cash realized a negative variance of ~ $157K, due to to
1.  Timing-related factors in Operating expenses including 1 time/annual payments, primarily insurance-related + three payroll periods that occurred in Feb-24 (RightSite payroll occurs every other week)
2.  Sales/Marketing/Gov't Relations had a negative variance primarily due to Advancing Health (payor advisors) + City of Jacksonville negotiations
3.  Dividend Income was negatively impacted by the timing of the institutional closing (1/31) and the F&F closing (3/18) relative to the model timing
