### Current Fundraising Status

- Committed capital secured: $3.7M total
	- Family office: $1.8M
	- Shahir: $200K
	- Michael Boxer: $200K
	- TMV: $1.5M (written commitment)
- Reserved ~$200K carve-out for Atria

### Active Investor Pipeline

- Maverick: Current gate is reference call with Jim Lacey (board member)
	- Jim already contacted Shahir for reference
	- Decision expected today/tomorrow
- Flair: Reviewing data room, asking about Guerrilla Health and Epic
	- Memo provided yesterday, awaiting response
- Wavemaker: IC meeting scheduled in 1 hour from call time
- Bessemer (Sophia): Re-engaged after hearing about interest
	- Writes small checks, reviewing data room
- Tau: In discussions with Katie, sharing diligence
- Outsider Fund: Generalist fund, IC meeting held Sunday, no response
- Sequoia: No follow-up, not pursuing

### Strategic Considerations

- TMV comparison: Less healthcare-focused than Maverick/Flair
	- Would prefer Maverick or Flair over TMV if offered
	- TMV showed strong conviction by chasing aggressively
- Round is oversubscribed, providing leverage and optionality
- Preference for engaged partners over forced decisions

### Timeline & Next Steps

- Decision timeline: End of week (Thursday/Friday) to finalize syndicate
- Expect clarity from Maverick, Flair, and Wavemaker by end of day tomorrow
- Strategy: Let process play out naturally without forcing decisions
- Rejected idea of tiered pricing (higher cap for angels vs funds)
