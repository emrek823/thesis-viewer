Can the pricing of your stop loss policy shift after the plan year?  
  
The answer is yes, at least for ACO REACH entities that elected the CMS stop loss option for 2025.  
  
This year, CMS introduced a budget neutrality factor that could materially affect payouts. Even with limited visibility into program-wide reimbursements, we know how CMS priced stop loss at the start of the year.  
  
The TLDR:  
  
1\. The factor will be calculated across all ACOs that elected CMS stop loss, pooling Standard/New Entrant and High Needs participants into one market.  
  
2\. It’s multiplicative, and the factor adjusts final payouts to ACO REACH plans after the year ends.  
  
3\. Plans won’t see the actual factor until the provisional or final settlement is released.  
  
What’s happening in the market (based on conversations at NAACOS last week and with ACO partners):  
  
1\. Participation is split: 100% of High Needs ACOs opted in, but only ~60% of Standard and New Entrant ACOs did. That likely means Standard ACOs are subsidizing higher cost High Needs spend, including categories like wound care.  
  
2\. RTA is in play: The 2025 Retrospective Trend Adjustment (RTA) is trending above 1.0 for Aged/Disabled lives. Stop-loss charges will be restated upwards, and plans will pay more than originally projected.  
  
3\. Calculated risk taking: CMS appears to be pulling back from unlimited reinsurance exposure, similar to how CMS wound down the ACA transitional reinsurance program and scaled back Part D catastrophic coverage.  
  
The takeaway: For ACO REACH organizations still using CMS stop loss, now is the time to model what a commercial alternative could look like for 2026.### [Dhruv Gupta • 2nd](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dg47)
