1.  *We are reporting results against the forecast as shared during the Dec-25 board meeting*
2.  *The YTD results are excluded as the variance for YTD is the same as the variance for the month of Nov*

**MD&A**

Net Revenue fell barely short of forecast due to a combination of delayed payor contracting and scheduling required new physicians to take activations before their payor credentialing was complete.

Patient Care Expenses were below forecast due to Care Team compensation and patient care cost (transportation + alternate site). We have focused the Care Team leadership on reducing physician hours while maintaining Brand Promise service levels with our EMS partners.

As a result, the cost per episode came down for the third month in a row, declining $28 from October. See p. 5 for more detail.

SG&A was well below forecast due to compensation and compensation related expenses (e.g., travel).

**MD&A**

**November Snapshot**
*   The Activations + Diversions forecast presented in the board meeting materials **included November actuals** resulting in no variance between actuals and forecast

**December Snapshot**
*   Enhanced Account Management efforts and new collaborative data sharing with EMS is showing encouraging signs on increasing same store call volume growth, with December trending 14% higher than November daily activation averages (63 to 72). New record number of episodes hit 119 last week.
*   **Georgia Update:** Using Grady as a testing ground, embedding a RightSite-employed medic in dispatch to provide clinical guidance and help dispatchers identify RightSite-eligible patients has been successful. Grady reached record call volumes, with daily averages increasing 39%, from 20 to 29. Once fully refined, we expect to extend this model to all large 911 clients. We've signed one new ATL area agency and Gwinnett, one of the "Big 4", is seeking to contract
*   **Texas:** Activation volume has remained stable, with SAFD. Our new Account Management (AM) process has secured leadership approval to increase call volume in Bell County, Fort Worth, and Montgomery County. We also anticipate higher volume from non-SAFD agencies. New sales–we have successfully established a presence in key remaining large metro areas. Currently, Corpus Christi, El Paso, CyFair (Houston), Dallas, Austin, and Bryan/College Station are all engaged in contract discussions. Notably, four of these potential clients are current Tele911 users.

            *   Most of the 179 unbillable claims were due to four new physicians (85%) that are not yet fully credentialed with GA and TX payors.
            *   We're improving new-physician onboarding with the goal of scheduling doctors who are fully credentialed, to minimize unbillable telehealth visits.
*   **Uninsured/Unknown: 27% (313)**
    *   In line with YTD of 27%
*   Based on receiving payments on 70% of the non-par claims billed in September, the decision was made to bill all non-par claims back to 1/1/25 for MA plans with 365 day timely filing, ~396 claims
*   The messaging was changed with Pointcare, the outsourced solution to assist in Medicaid enrollment, to encourage increased enrollment success. We expect to see if it resulted in improved results in December.
*   We are currently collecting approximately 3% of patient balances. After three billing statements, we will write off balances we do not expect to collect. All such balances are fully reserved.
