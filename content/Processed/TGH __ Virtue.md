### TGH’s Current AI Implementation Progress

- Adopting different point solutions at good pace relative to other health systems
- Palantir partnership (big focus)
	- 8-10 different use cases live and making impact
	- Sepsis detection, inpatient image utilization, other areas
	- Extract data manually - more work than other solutions
	- Struggle to know what’s vaporware vs. deployable in practice
- Epic rollout expanding
	- 3-4 current deployments with roadmap for more
	- Epic tying AI onboarding to honor roll/gold stars creates friction with startups
- Microsoft Copilot deployment
	- All-in as Microsoft shop
	- Clinics already using, now moving to inpatient setting with nurses
	- More limited workflow compared to Abridge alternatives
- Hyro voice agent rollout
	- Recent deployment for scheduling
	- Initial feedback: “loving it” - actually getting more schedules than in-person
	- Goals: reduce wait times, move workload off call center agents
	- No specific metrics available yet
- Other AI medical devices deployed across various areas

### Palantir Assessment & Alternative Solutions

- Cost justification concerns - “I don’t know if it justifies the cost”
- Best use case: really unique and hairy TGH problems
	- Example: Blood bank cyber attack - Palantir spun up algorithm in 8 hours to prioritize blood allocation during traumas/surgeries
	- Good for situations costing tons of money or creating quality challenges
- Looking for prompt-based solutions over EHR
	- Want ChatGPT-like interface instead of boots-on-ground implementation
	- Current limitation: most solutions only access structured data
	- Need unstructured data access for operational/clinical value
- Meta’s current offering limited to structured data only
- Priority use case for prompting capability: inpatient throughput and case management

### Virtue Portfolio Companies & Strategic Opportunities

- Translucent (agentic FP&A for hospitals)
	- Series A just preempted by Google Ventures
	- Expanded from medical groups to health systems quickly
	- Contracts with Cedars, UT Southwestern, Northwestern, Mayo
	- Demonstrating immediate ROI, expanding agents/service lines rapidly
	- Strategic round for companies like TGH planned in ~90 days
	- Jack O’Hara available at upcoming Health conference
- Dart Health discussion
	- Youngest but most technically sophisticated Virtue team
	- Doubled revenue in last 60 days
	- Can read unstructured text/PDFs in EHR
	- Flexible integration: data warehouse, EMR, or minimal security review
	- Built for healthcare from start (vs. Palantir learning curve)
- Acolyte partnership being explored
	- Video agents for healthcare training/education and patient education
	- TGH working on strategic partnership, not investment
