## Abstract

An essential technique for diagnosing brain disorders is electrophysiological source imaging (ESI). While model-based optimization and deep learning methods have achieved promising results in this field, the accurate selection and refinement of features remains a central challenge for precise ESI. This paper proposes FAIR-ESI, a novel framework that adaptively refines feature importance across different views, including FFT-based spectral feature refinement, weighted temporal feature refinement, and self-attention-based patch-wise feature refinement. Extensive experiments on two simulation datasets with diverse configurations and two real-world clinical datasets validate our framework's efficacy, highlighting its potential to advance brain disorder diagnosis and offer new insights into brain function.
