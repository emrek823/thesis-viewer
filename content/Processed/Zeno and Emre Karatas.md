### Company Overview & Technology

- Building body computer interface for real-time health data collection
- Wearable patch using MIT-developed technology with microarrays that peer skin minimally
- FDA regulated device due to skin penetration (though imperceptible to user)
- Creates singular data platform enabling healthcare automation through continuous data streaming

### Core Technical Innovation

- Cross-reactive sensors replacing traditional one-to-one sensing approach
	- Use few sensors to detect dozens of biomarkers vs. 100 sensors for 100 biomarkers
	- Expansion becomes software/signal processing challenge rather than hardware redesign
- General signal transduction mechanism adaptable to any target
	- Moves beyond glucose-only limitations (stuck for 20 years)
	- Works across metabolomic, proteomic biomarkers, electrolytes
- Key differentiator from competitors:
	- Aptamer-based solutions too complex for single biomarker accuracy
	- Enzymatic approaches limited to glucose and few irrelevant markers

### Market Strategy & Philosophy

- Time resolution is the critical gap, not new test development
	- High friction → frictionless data collection
	- Low time resolution → continuous monitoring
- Better to leverage understood biomarkers than prove new ones
- Starting in clinical realm before consumer to streamline FDA approval process
- Positioned as infrastructure player rather than single product company

### Funding & Partnership Interest

- Raising $3-4M with existing committed investors
- Looking for strategic partners rather than lead investors
- Values network access and landscape perspective for expansion strategy
- Clinical focus initially to prove concept before broader market expansion

### Next Steps

- Zeno to send technical materials and research papers
- Potential 4pm meeting today in San Francisco (pending schedule adjustment)
- Continue conversations about partnership structure and value-add beyond capital
