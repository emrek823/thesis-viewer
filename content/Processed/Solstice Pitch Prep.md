### Pitch Feedback & Refinement

- Language cleanup needed
	- Remove filler words (“umms”, “kinda”, “ugh”)
	- Add punctuation and natural pauses in delivery
	- Stop sounding mechanical/robotic
- Product differentiation emphasis
	- Highlight biopharma content compliance requirements vs general marketing
	- Explain why content is valuable compared to general marketing
	- Frame as: “Imagine A/B testing but every iteration requires 3-month compliance review”
- Team introduction timing
	- Include personal story (10 years together, healthcare background)
	- Position origin story: raised 2023, current form only ~1 year old
	- Emphasize momentum and velocity achieved

### Market Positioning & Competitive Moat

- Content creation complexity
	- Something as simple as email: 2 months, $50k cost
	- Requires PharmDs, PhDs, MDs to read clinical literature
	- FDA regulates every communication to patients/physicians
- Competitive advantage discussion
- Veeva positioning response
	- “Why does Real Chemistry exist if Veeva can build AI tools?”
	- Veeva hasn’t entered this space in 10+ years despite opportunity

### Go-to-Market Strategy

- Bottom-up approach starting with individual marketers
	- Direct pain point experience with agencies
	- Easy quality assessment (can see content immediately)
	- High NPS and internal virality within pharma companies
- Enterprise scaling potential
	- Each brand team operates independently with tens of millions budget
	- AstraZeneca example: 80+ brands, $350k ACV per indication = $500M potential
	- MSA advantage over competitors once established

### Traction & Revenue Metrics

- Current performance: $1.6M ARR in 6 months
- Pipeline: Anticipating $3.2M within 30 days (potentially too aggressive for blurb)
- Customer quality: Real MSAs with 3 of top 10 pharma companies
- Additional prospect: Akebia Therapeutics, $276k contract in MSA process

### Upcoming Fundraise Schedule

- Monday calls: TCV, Left Lane, Lux, Felicis, Adam Goldberg, Dimension, CRV
- Tuesday calls: First Round, Craft Ventures, Flair, Great Point
- Wednesday: a16z meeting scheduled
- Tier 1 firms (Kleiner, NEA, Sequoia) outreach planned for early next week

### Next Steps

- Practice pitch delivery over weekend
- Refine blurb language (remove “extremely sticky” hyperbole)
- Consider adding customer name-drops higher in blurb
- Schedule follow-up with Sean/Emre for Wednesday/Thursday next week
