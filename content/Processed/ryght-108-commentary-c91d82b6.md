Thought process

Look and analyze all trials by phase and indication

Dive deeper into phase and indication differences

Based on these analyses, how should i design new trial? Give me a few options

Next step: Narrow down to 10 trials for web research

Key takeaways

Comprehensiveness in response (asking about Ph II trials and only returning subset)

Scratch pad to create a document

Ct.gov comparison

https://clinicaltrials.gov/search?term=tyk2 30

Ryght = 30 (CHECK)

“Tell me about all Tyk2 trials”

Select all option would be great

I asked for industry sponsored trials and it didn’t return all of them (Alumis trial). Tried again and not returning all

What am I doing with this data as it generates? Im using this google doc as scratch pad…

### Phase 1 Trials

### Phase 2 Trials

### Phase 3 Trials

This table should help you get a clear overview of the indu

I downloaded CSV to create his table by phase. I would do same by inidication / disease area

Then I’d dig deeper on each trial by phase

Let's analyze all ph I trials. Create a table that lists out each individual trial and provides comparisons to all other trials with the following columns: enrollment, eligibility criteria, study design, and primary/secondary outcomes

### Analysis of Phase 1 Trials

### Commentary

Enrollment:

Both trials have a similar enrollment size, with 24 and 36 participants respectively, which is typical for Phase 1 studies focusing on initial safety and pharmacokinetics.

Eligibility Criteria:

Both trials have similar inclusion and exclusion criteria, focusing on healthy adult participants and excluding those with significant medical conditions or recent participation in other clinical trials. This is standard practice to minimize variability and focus on the drug's effects.

Study Design:

Both trials are open-label, single-dose pharmacokinetic studies designed to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of the investigational drugs.

The PF-06700841 trial specifically evaluates different formulations (immediate release and modified release tablets), while the CPL409116 trial focuses on determining the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).

Primary/Secondary Outcomes:

Both trials have primary outcomes related to pharmacokinetics, such as Cmax, AUC, and Tmax.

The PF-06700841 trial includes additional secondary outcomes related to safety and tolerability, such as changes in ECG parameters, heart rate, blood pressure, and laboratory abnormalities.

The CPL409116 trial includes additional secondary outcomes related to cytokine induction and downstream cytokine production, reflecting its broader potential application in inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.

This analysis should provide a comprehensive understanding of the similarities and differences between the Phase 1 trials, as well as insights into their implications.

Repeat for Ph II and III…

I then search for all trials in psoarsis - going beyond tyk2. Can these all be in the same collection?
