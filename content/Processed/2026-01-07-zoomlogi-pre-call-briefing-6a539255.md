# ZoomLogi Pre-Call Briefing | January 2026

## Questions to Explore

Product/Technology

What is the current AI resolution rate? July '25 showed 96.9%—has this improved?

The no-code workflow builder is in production with "≥3 customers." Which customers? What are they building?

Transport Provider Alerts ships in next 30 days. What does this enable that isn't possible today?

What data would be required to move from exception detection to exception prediction?

Is the AI calling infrastructure single-action (call carrier) or multi-action capable (call + reroute + notify + log)?

Commercial

Progress Pharmacy signed in 2 months with no pilot. What made that cycle so fast vs. Verily at 7+ months?

Natera chose a competitor. Who? What did they offer that ZoomLogi didn't?

Specialty pharmacies appear repeatedly (Progress, UIC, Cardinal downstream). Intentional focus or pattern emerging?

4 closed-lost in Dec (Natera, Catalent, Immunocore, Bayer). Is there a pattern?

Hitting 26 goals with Q1 cadence of 10 logos?

### Product Evolution

### AI Performance Metrics (July '25)

AI Involvement Rate: 89.2%

AI Resolution Rate: 96.9%

Note: December '25 metrics not provided in MBR.

## Section 3: Cardinal Health Relationship

Current Status:

$200k ARR

Extended 3 months beyond original December end date

March customer event presentation scheduled (1,000+ attendees expected)

Significance:

Largest current customer

Cardinal's top 5 delivery locations are specialty pharmacies (Accredo, CVS Specialty, etc.)

Potential distribution channel via March event

From Prior Research (Tommy Barnes, ex-P44):

"Why do you chase Walmart? Because Walmart's going to commoditize you and it's going to drag you down. Well, you chase Walmart because they have 9,000 suppliers."

Cardinal has similar network potential in pharma distribution.

## Section 4: Competitive Landscape Research

### Project44 and FourKites Positioning

From Tegus Expert (Former P44 Chief Industry Officer):

"Project44, although they do visibility, most of what they're doing is tracking ambient product or not necessarily focused on pharmaceutical... when we really talk about cold chain, that's where you're starting to require more of that hardware where companies like Controlant, Tive, and Roambee provide the hardware that allows you to track not just location but temperature measurement, condition, humidity, shock."

"If you look at it in terms of percentage of what pharmaceutical uses compared to CPG industry or retail, it's obviously a lot smaller percentage of the market."

From Tommy Barnes (ex-P44 CEO):

"The pharma sales cycle was a longer sales cycle that had more requirements, especially from a security standpoint, than most folks were accustomed to."

"If you don't know that space well, it's one of those spaces where you're quickly exposed. If you walk in and start trying to talk about comparing retail to pharma, they can know pretty quickly by the words you use if you know it pretty well or not."

### P44/FourKites AI Capabilities (2025)

Project44:

Predictive ETAs with 90%+ accuracy within 2-hour window on final transit day

"Movement" AI assistant with natural language queries ("What's the status of my shipments to Port of Long Beach?")

Modal stitching for door-to-door visibility

1,100+ telematics vendor integrations

FourKites:

"Dynamic ETA" analyzing 150+ data points including driver hours-of-service

Dynamic yard management with automated gate-in/gate-out

Risk management alerts for potential delays

Key Limitation (Both): Per Maverick QA document: "P44 focuses pretty much exclusively on location tracking, while Pharma has requirements for temperature / shock / light / humidity tracking as well."

### Hardware Providers (Controlant, Tive, Sensitech)

From Tegus Expert:

"Less than 5% of shipments have hardware trackers. Most people, their use case is good enough to say, okay, if we can track the whole load by knowing where the truck is, that's good enough for us."

"The cold chain pharmaceutical is more of a niche market. But it is a very important market, and it's much more related to the quality of the hardware, not just of the data."

Relationship Model: P44/FourKites partner with hardware providers via API integrations rather than competing directly.

## Section 5: AI/ML Innovations in Supply Chain (External Research)

### Predictive Exception Prevention

Quantified Results:

78% reduction in temperature excursions with AI-powered monitoring (World Pharma Today)

40% fewer temperature excursions with AI cold chain monitoring (Fleet Rabbit)

90%+ accuracy in predicting reefer failures 2-4 weeks in advance (Fleet Rabbit)

2-4 hours advance warning before threshold breach (World Pharma Today)

Technical Approaches:

ML algorithms analyzing IoT sensor data, transportation systems, and environmental monitoring

Pattern recognition across temperature, humidity, GPS, weather, and traffic data

Edge computing at sensor locations for reduced latency

Equipment degradation detection by comparing current performance to baselines across thousands of units

From CargoSense:

"AI-driven predictions about shipments before they leave the distribution center."

### Agentic AI in Supply Chains

IBM/Oracle Report (2025):

53% of supply chain executives currently enable autonomous workflows via AI agents

76% project improved efficiency from agents handling repetitive tasks

61% revenue growth premium for organizations with higher AI investment in supply chain

Capabilities Emerging:

Dynamic rerouting based on real-time traffic and weather

Autonomous supplier negotiation

Multi-agent coordination across ecosystem partners

Prescriptive recommendations beyond "if/then" exception management

From HBR Research (Dec 2025): Multi-agent systems in simulated supply chains achieved 67-82% cost reduction compared to human operators by mitigating bullwhip effect.

Key Distinction (Logistics Viewpoints):

"AI agents are part of an intelligent system that perceives, reasons, and acts toward defined business goals... determining not just what's happening, but what should be done next and why."

### GDP/Compliance Automation

Emerging Capabilities:

Auto-generated audit packages with complete chain of custody

Pre-shipment compliance validation (carrier certification, packaging validation, customs zones)

AI-flagged deviations with instant alerts

21 CFR Part 11 compliant documentation

From PMC/NIH:

"Automated documentation tools have emerged to support compliance, generating comprehensive documentation packages directly from model development environments."

### Natural Language Interfaces

P44 "Movement": Users can ask questions like "What's the status of my shipments to the Port of Long Beach?" and receive instant summaries.

Industry Direction: Moving from dashboard-based interfaces to conversational queries, particularly for operational staff during warehouse operations.

## Section 6: Pharma-Specific Needs (Primary Research)

### From Pfizer Transport Qualification Manager (Tegus)

On Real-Time Monitoring:

"We're slowly transitioning to this real-time monitoring system... right now we're still using older technology and having to upload them in other systems. A lot of times, we'll use temperature monitors and data loggers that, once they arrive, have to be downloaded."

On Shock/Vibration Data:

"Shock and vibe would also be great to have. If the container is dropped, that could give us information if the shipper is damaged. And not only is the thermal integrity compromised, but also if the shipper container itself, the product itself is jeopardized in any way."

On System Fragmentation:

"We're hoping [between multiple systems]. That's why I think the push is really to go to this one system... depending on which loggers the site is using, sometimes not all sites are using the newest and greatest."

### From Vertex Cell Therapy (ZoomLogi Interview)

On Manual Processes:

"The biggest pain point in cell and gene therapy, so much of it is manual... there's so much room there for machine learning on these data sets that's not being taken advantage of, again, largely because it's not compliant with what the FDA wants."

### From J&J Head of Trade Compliance (ZoomLogi Interview)

On Predictive AI:

"Where AI could probably come into play... if those coolers were not able to be delivered within 48 hours, we had to automatically send them back and destroy the product... you could have not only temperature control, but even AI understanding, okay, what is the likelihood that this is actually going to arrive on time?"

## Section 7: Technology Opportunity Matrix

Based on research across vault sources and web, organized by current industry maturity:

## Section 8: Market Context

### Cold Chain Market Size

Global cold chain logistics market: $505B projected by 2032 (Allied Market Research)

Cold chain monitoring market: $35B in 2024, projected $120B by 2030

### Loss Estimates

$35B in pharmaceutical products lost annually due to temperature excursions (IQVIA)

25% of vaccines degraded by delivery due to temperature excursions (WHO)

Majority of losses stem from human error or lack of visibility, not equipment failure (ISPE)

### Hardware Penetration

Less than 5% of all shipments have hardware trackers (Tegus P44 Expert)

P44 has partnerships with ~1,100 telematics vendors

FourKites connects with 800+ carriers, 3PLs, and supply chain partners
