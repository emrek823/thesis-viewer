*This slide highlights the "Competitors*" and "Could be either long-term" categories across the matrix, with an emphasis on "Transparency Benchmarking Services" (EY, Deloitte.) and "Care Marketplace" (Accarent HEALTH, coral, SESAME) in the long-term, and "Contracting & Negotiation Services" (CHANGE HEALTHCARE, HEALTHSPARQ, FinThrive, Clarify, AKASA, zelis) in the near-term/could-be-either categories as having the potential to own the new RCM stack.*
*These are point solution competitors and not necessarily true competitors to our entire platform.*

These segments are not mutually exclusive. In particularly, many of the transparency companies play in multiple segments (e.g. across products, services, tools).

These companies have the advantage of larger existing customer bases but disadvantage of not being seen as pricing transparency experts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Deloitte, EY, Guidehouse, Milliman                                                                                                 |

We may bump them more into the future as we focus more on compliance tooling.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Handl Health, TALON, Zea Med                                                                                                       |

Not often seen as competitors. Focus may vary between optimizing RCM / maximizing claims, payments, or network optimization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | RCM: Change Healthcare, Finthrive, PMMC, SmarterDx<br>Networks: Clarify                                                              |

| Rates Look-up / Care Search     | Rate Sense, Reporting, Care Search, APIs                      | Search for care where most often the inputs are patient insurance, desired provider specialty and outputs are providers organized by value and quality. Can either be consumer or employer facing.                                                                                                                                    | May overlap with transparency data-layer but most often claims-based. Further developing our Payer API would cause us to directly compete here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Garner Health, Guroo, Healthcare Price Tool                                                              |
| Care Navigation                 | Rate Sense, APIs, Ribbon Price Transparency Powered by Turquoise | Care coordination companies, each with a distinct laundry list of additional tech-first or services-oriented features such as asynchronous patient communication (e.g. texting patients), on-staff care coordinators/nurses, claims management, medication management, scheduling.                                                            | They are often seen as competitors by the less-informed but they are actually great channel partners for us. However, further development of our Payer API would result in a "light" care navigation solution.                                                                                                                                                                                             | Apree Health (Vera x Castlight), Healthsparq, Virgin Pulse, Rightway, Ribbon Health                          |
| Care Marketplace (Bundles or Shoppable services) | Turquoise Verified Marketplace, SSPs, Patient Estimator Tools | Marketplace for healthcare, often cash-pay with scheduling. May be shoppable services, COE-models (e.g. bundles), or labs/test-focused.                                                                                                                                                                                           | Provider-led COE / bundle models are most interesting.

| Data Marketplace                | Our data would be a component of a data marketplace           | Companies that aggregate and sell raw and/or "cleansed” healthcare data based on customer interest (e.g. breakdown of services in a region, payer mix, insurer coverage, drug spend by class/indication/setting of care). Often build analytics / products on top. Largely claims-based.                                                  | Can be seen as potential channel partners for our data (IQVIA could sell our drug data). May be where we evolve to if Turquoise decides to accumulate additional types of data (claims, utilization).                                                                                                                                                                                                | IQVIA, Komodo, Change Healthcare                                                                         |

## Slide 43: What are key trends in segments?

**Initial hypothesis**

1.  Price Transparency Data - Unclear how successful all these players are
2.  Rates Benchmarking and Analytics- Either on top of claims/transparency
3.  Managed Care Contracts - Tend to be focused
4.  Transparency Compliance - Often players in other segments, dipping toes to transparency. Where large consultants are looking to play
5.  Marketplace - No evidence of success here but lots of activity
6.  Care Navigation/Doctor Search - Most often playing in multiple segments with confusing to understand value propositions
