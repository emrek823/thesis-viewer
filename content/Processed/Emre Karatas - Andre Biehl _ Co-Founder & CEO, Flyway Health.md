### Andre Biehl Background & Company Evolution

- Co-founder with Taiwan (Princeton background, CS major)
- Started with data cleaning thesis for ML bottlenecks
- Pivoted to pharma due to claims data complexity
- Built initial cohorting platform, used pharma conferences as entry point
- $1M pre-seed uncapped safe completed
- Just finished priced round (2 months ago, paperwork ongoing)

### Platform & Product Strategy

- Evolution from chatbots to agentic exploration
	- Problem: chatbots require knowing what to ask
	- Solution: autonomous swarm intelligence running for hours
	- Delivers complex insights (not just simple Komodo/IQVIA queries)
- Pivot from software to managed services
	- Speed to complex insights in ~1 week vs 6+ months internal analytics
	- Work with brand leads and market access teams
	- Send decks instead of requiring platform adoption
- Recent pilot success
	- Found insight client took 6 months to triangulate in 1 week
	- Outperformed internal analytics team with different methodology
	- Moving to RFP process for MSA

### Market Access & Data Strategy

- Focus on contracting and rebates as biggest levers
	- Sales effectiveness declining (no-show policies)
	- Analytics not good enough for rebate money at stake
- Data partnerships
	- Purple Labs for recent cohort data
	- MMIT for formulary data (bullish)
	- HealthVerity and IQVIA licensing
	- Combining datasets for comprehensive rebate strategy
- Advanced analytics approach
	- Pull entire therapeutic areas (not narrow cohorts)
	- Cross-TA prescribing behavior analysis
	- Intent to prescribe modeling beyond market basket approaches

### Next Steps

- Andre traveling to NYC 2-3x weekly starting next month
- Plan to meet up in NYC or Andre can connect when Emre travels through New Jersey
