### Unmatched Accuracy

Our AI is designed to identify every valid diagnosis in a chart by first flagging all possible conditions, then narrowing to the ones that meet risk adjustment criteria. That means you capture what counts - without overcoding or missing key conditions.

### Engineered for RADV

We look both ways - capturing additions and deletions - with each diagnosis backed by exact chart text, clinical reasoning, and dual review by AI and certified coders. The result: audit-ready files built for RADV defense and full compliance.

## How it Works

Step 1

##### Any chart format can be imported including PDF, XML, and EMR exports.

Step 2

##### The HealthMC platform rapidly processes large batches of charts using our custom AI.

Step 3

##### Expert certified coders review the AI identified conditions alongside the chart.
