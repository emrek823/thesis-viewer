            *   Smaller Contracts. Shorter Sales Cycles.
            *   More Potential Customers
    *   Leads to **HP/MSO/IPA**

    *   If **Yes**:
        *   **Valley Steer directly sending data to providers?**
            *   If **Yes**:
                *   **RBE allows Valley Steer to pay providers directly?**
                    *   If **Yes**:
                        *   Customer Is RBE. Billing Service Not Required.
                    *   If **No**:
                        *   Customer Is Provider. Likely Requires Billing Service
