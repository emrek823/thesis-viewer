# Machinify - EVP of Operations at Cotiviti Holdings, Inc

Interview conducted on May 30, 2024

## Topics
Payment Integrity, Acquisition, Prepay Editing, Implementation Cycle, Healthcare, Client Onboarding, R&D, Technology Play

## Summary
The conversation between the Tegus Client and the EVP of Operations at Cotiviti Holdings, Inc highlighted the differentiation of Cotiviti from other players in the healthcare and integrity space, such as Optum, Rialtic, Codoxo, and Machinify. Cotiviti is positioned as a service provider with a focus on content development and secondary editing, offering enriched content at a higher price compared to Optum. The market share of various players, including Optum and Cotiviti in health plans, was also discussed, along with the concentration of the market with Lyric, Optum, and Cotiviti being the main players in the prepay editing space. Pricing models for these services vary, with primary editors typically charging a flat fee and secondary editors charging a percent of savings.

## Expert Details
Expert is the EVP Operations at Cotiviti Holdings, Inc. The Expert is responsible for leading the prospective payment operations in the payment integrity space, which is a $600 MM a year business.

## Client
Hi. Thanks for taking the time to talk with me. I am interested in learning more about the healthcare and integrity space. First question for you. Can you talk a bit about your current rollout activity?

## Expert
Yes. I lead the prospective payment integrity operations for Cotiviti, which includes the content development and setup and includes the client service function product, client onboarding and R&D.

## Client
The first question for you then is, how do you think Cotiviti differentiate itself from I want to do two different sets of players, the older players like on Optum and then also some of them more tech forward players. First of all, how do you see yourself in the market compared to an Optum?

## Expert
In comparison with an Optum. When you look at the advent of the industry, really Optum or really it was McKesson at the time, which now has through various different acquisitions and spin-offs has become Lyric. McKesson became Lyric, Optum is really the old Ingenix product. Both Optum and Lyric, I'll just use the current names, really entered the marketplace largely as a software install and light on the content area or the business rules or intellectual property area.

It was a little bit more of a technology play. Now they might say, yes, we had content, and they're right about that. They did have content. But Cotiviti entered the marketplace as a service provider selling a result selling a financial result and invested very heavily in the content arena, perhaps less so arguably in the technology arena and really gave rise to what the industry now calls the secondary editing position.

Pre Cotiviti, there was only really Ingenix and McKesson, and they had an install and nobody needed a term for primary editor because there wasn't a secondary, and that's what the Cotiviti gave rise to was the secondary editor, which created obviously then the primary position as well, at least in terms of naming.

## Client
Maybe today then, when people are choosing between using an Optum or Cotiviti, what makes them go to an Optum instead of a Cotiviti?

## Expert
Well, in the payment integrity space because there's now a primary and now is secondary, there's not a singular place. Cotiviti really only plays in the secondary position Optum and Lyric largely only play in the primary position. That means for every potential client, there's arguably two sales, but sometimes there's even three because they may have Optum, Lyric and Cotiviti in play.

That definitely exists, but the differentiator between the companies and why somebody would choose Cotiviti and choose an Optum would be getting, let's call it, basic content at a lower Price for Optum, and you're getting more enriched content at a higher Price from Cotiviti. There is the notion in that primary secondary role it's generally referred to as stacking vendors.

There's just an industry notion that the further downstream you are, the higher Price you can command because arguably, the upstream party got the low-hanging fruit and what you can find downstream is higher.

## Client
Have you heard of some of these newer players like Codoxo, Rialtic, Machinify, Aleafia Health?

## Expert
I've heard of all of them have pretty much in the order that you referenced them, maybe Rialtic ahead of Codoxo because I to because I know the CEO at Rialtic, in that order, I would say, most familiar Rialtic to Codoxo to Machinify to the last one, and I've only seen their name. I I don't know really anything about them.

## Client
Can you talk a bit about Rialtic, Codoxo, and Machinify? Well, maybe if we can go one by one. Can you talk a bit about what you think are Rialtic's advantages compared to Cotiviti?

## Expert
Yes. With Rialtic, I see what they're trying to do, this is not necessarily an advantage or a disadvantage in my opinion. What they are trying to do is enable a health plan to basically self-service their payment integrity space. They're trying to go not head-to-head, but they're trying to outflank the Cotiviti by going upstream and enabling a health plan to do for themselves.

They're offering software as a service and I think at some level, a package of edits that the health plan can customize on their own. They're doing that, at least last knowledge on my part, they didn't have a lot of artificial intelligence built in. I'm sure it's somewhere in there they use some machine learning principles.

They're attacking the primary editing space, code editing, not complex claims. They're not as broad from a content standpoint as a Cotiviti for sure. Then you've got Machinify in there, who is offering a service model, not a self-service model like Rialtic is but a service model itself where you give us your data will provide the services and I think, certainly, they are good technology AI company, and they are trying to identify what the denial route or claim editing route should be.

They are trying to, in essence, I think reverse engineer content from prior results. They're primarily a technology company where Rialtic has a lot of technology, but I'll call it a healthy dose of content knowledge, Machinify is exclusively a technology company in my perception.

## Client
What do you mean by content knowledge?

## Expert
Yes. Good question. That's our term, it's general industry term for how do you determine what claims you should deny, which claims are coded improperly, which claims are overpaid by the health plan. You can think of them as business rules and the most simplistic form, you could think of it if these two codes are built together, then they shouldn't be paid. For instance, a simple lab example. You go to the doctor, you get blood drawn. They send it off to the lab.

You went in probably for sore throat. They pulled it, they eventually diagnosed, you with face strep. They sent the blood to the lab, but they don't know what your issue is. They've got to run a number of different tests. It's called a lab panel. It typically is five or six tests. They should build a code that represents all five or six tests. But what they do is they build each test individually all five of them individually and thereby getting paid more.

The content that I'm referring to is or intellectual property or business rule is the logic that says, oh, I see these five individual codes build for five different blood tests on the same patients, same data service, those should be paid as a singular code and it's this one right here, it's code #7, and that saves the insurance company money.

That is what is those business rules, and there are thousands upon thousands of these, those business rules are what I call content. At the end I think this might put a fine point on it. The business rules at the end of the day is what creates the value for the health plan. It's what tells the health plan, you can pay less on this claim.

## Client
The example you just gave, that was a bundling example.

## Expert
Yes.

## Client
What about Codoxo?

## Expert
Yes. We don't run into them very often at Cotiviti. There's more of an up and comer.

## Client
Do you run into [ submission ] often then?

## Expert
We haven't really begun to run into Rialtic. We've seen them once or twice, but not in a competitive situation, we just run into people they've tried to sell into. Cotiviti of the largest health plans. The largest health plans are the ones that are furthest along in trying to accomplish a do-it-yourself kind of world. They have begun talking with companies like Rialtic that's why we have run in them as our clients are kind of talking about them a little bit.

## Client
Does Cotiviti sell services and software to your earlier point?

## Expert
No, no. Cotiviti well, in some areas in the fraud, waste and abuse, we sell a software product.

## Client
But it's mostly anti packaged services. entire programs.

## Expert
Yes. We don't want to sell software, put it that way. We don't really want to sell software.

## Client
How big is Cotiviti's business?

## Expert
We are considered the market leader in payment integrity. This is public knowledge. We were just acquired by KKR. That deal has closed, and the deal was for $10.5 billion. That's public.

## Client
If you have any notes about Codoxo that would be super helpful and I'm also curious, so you said Machinify maybe comes up a little bit more often. I'm curious maybe if people have chosen Machinify over Cotiviti and why or if they're using Machinify and Cotiviti, what is the use case for Machinify versus Cotiviti?

## Expert
Yes. I don't know of anybody that's chosen Machinify over Cotiviti. It doesn't mean it happens, it hasn't happened. I just don't think that it has. The reason somebody is interested in a Machinify is a bit of the point I made earlier is they pay a fair amount to secondary editors, and they want to try to do the work themselves.

I think the people that are talking with Machinify for the most part are the larger plans that are trying to in-source payment integrity at some level, and it's a little bit more of an experimentation mode at this point.

## Client
What's our market share between the various players in the space, just rough estimates?

## Expert
Well that's an interesting question given, say you had only 10 health plans and all 10 health plans have an Optum and a Cotiviti in them. Do both of them have 100% market share. I don't know necessarily how to think of that in your world, but there is a major concern that a lot of the larger players have with Optum, and that is United as the owner and United gaining insight to their provider contracting and reimbursement methods.

The product name that Optum has is called iCES and the product name that Lyric has was being called ClaimsXten. I don't know if they still call it that, to be quite honest. But that product, the Lyric product is fairly very common in the marketplace. I'd be willing to bet Lyric shows up at, I would guess, at least at 20 of the largest 25 health plans in the U.S., maybe not quite that many. They're 80%, maybe 70% of the largest health plans.

## Client
Lyric is larger and more prevalent than Optum or Cotiviti in this space?

## Expert
No, not more prevalent than Cotiviti. Optum has a broad suite of products. Lyric really only has a prepay editing product. That means that in the prepay editing, I see Lyric more often because remember, it's really the old McKesson product. Lyric is new as a company, pardon me, I say McKesson that was really Change Healthcare, which was part of that. Change Healthcare was acquired by United Healthcare.

The government forced United to spin out the prepay editing product. That's the only piece that United was not allowed to acquire and that became Lyric AI. They're really a much older company than their name suggests, and it's really the Change Healthcare old McKesson product. That is definitely more prevalent than the Optum, the direct competitor to what Lyric has. The direct competitor to ClaimsXten that Lyric is the iCES product at Optum.

## Client
The question I have is within the space, is it fragmented or concentrated? If you put Lyric, Optum and Cotiviti together, is that 80% of the market?

## Expert
Yes. I would be willing to bet that if you think of the Venn diagram in the prepay editing space, let's hold the conversation there for the moment. In the prepaid editing space and you had a Venn diagram of the client names for each of the three, there's a whole lot of overlap between Cotiviti and Lyric, less overlap between Optum in ICES product and Cotiviti.

We just don't see them nearly as much. I would rank them in terms of order of number of clients in the large end, the nationals and regionals. I would say, Cotiviti, Lyric and then Optum. Now when you get to the other products that Optum has to offer, they show up everywhere.

## Client
It's the postpay?

## Expert
Yes. Postpay through their Equian acquisition, and they had some other prepay products as well from the past but with the stacking of vendors, they are becoming more active in the prepaid space.

## Client
Yes. Are most of the large carriers, they all stack and the way in which they stack, it sounds like is they have Lyric first, and they have Cotiviti or Optum second and then maybe some other more niche providers.

## Expert
Yes. I think generally, that's the case, Lyric would likely be first. It's almost certainly be first or second, Optum being first or second and then Cotiviti. Cotiviti is generally at the end of the line.

## Client
Is it just because of Price?

## Expert
Price and Cotiviti's choice at the beginning. Cotiviti has sold themselves as a secondary editor for two decades.

## Client
Can you talk a little bit about what is the sales cycle like for these big payers and that maybe also if you guys have more mid-market payers, what is the sales cycle like for those payers?

## Expert
Yes. Sales cycle is an interesting concept when most of the vendors are already at most of the clients. If we're not an install, not part of their solution, we've already talked with them for years ago. When does it start? When do you start measuring the sales cycle. When a purchase is finally made and you look at, well, what was the last point in time we really reengaged seriously with them? I would say it's easily 12 months if not more. Then you've got an implementation cycle after that before you get to revenue.

## Client
What does the typical implementation cycle look like?

## Expert
That runs six months on the shorter end to nine to 12 on the longer end. Usually, it depends on whether the

## Expert
client has a packaged claim system that you might be familiar with from Cognizant or a HealthEdge? Or does it have its own homegrown claim system where resources and knowledge and resources are constrained, and knowledge is limited. Those take longer, the package systems are shorter.

## Client
Then for this easily 12-month sales cycle for the larger payers, what is the blocker there? Is it just essentially you need to speak with a lot of people to get things through? Why does it make it so long?

## Expert
Sure. A few things. It's considered a complex sale. This service crosses pretty much every aspect of a health plan, their claims group, their network management group, their provider and member services group technology with integration. Everybody can say no, or anybody can say no or throw up smoke screens, so to get the sale, everybody pretty much has to say yes.

The nature of the complex sale getting alignment across the organization and getting through a few barriers with technology and their delivery schedule. Oftentimes, the competition is not another player. It's the technology road map for the company.

## Client
Then maybe coming back to Codoxo. Were you able to find any notes on that company?

## Expert
Yes, Codoxo. Their solutions that they're offering, they do have a number of them. Well, two things. One is they are really trying to play up as many companies are, their AI nature. I find that all very questionable with them. Then in the payment integrity space, I feel like just beginning in this space, they focus a bit on the fraud, and they don't seem to take much from which, by the way, the fraud solutions tend to be offered retrospectively today.

That's where they have entered. Then they seem to be more of a, I don't want to say claim editor, but almost like identifying a clean claim. I haven't seen them go in front and then start generating tremendous value. In the claim editing space, I think they're pretty [ ].

## Client
What's the typical pricing model and ACV for something like this?

## Expert
Pricing models tend to fall into two buckets. One is and this is largely, not exclusively, but largely a primary editor is going to be under a license fee, and it's a flat fee, maybe couched as a PM contractually. But it's generally a flat fee. Then in the secondary space, it tends to be a percent of savings. The payer that has the primary editor on a license model, whether it's PM, PM or just a license fee, I would guess is about probably about 20% maybe of the rate of the secondary editor position so there's a pretty substantial difference.

It might not be quite that broad, but it's a pretty significant difference. Then you got to consider the value creation that is involved as well. It's just putting it in personal income terms, would you rather have somebody save you $100 and charge you five? Or would you rather have somebody save you $1,000 and charge you $100, $200, or so.

## Client
All right. Thank you for taking the time to speak with me. Have a nice day.
