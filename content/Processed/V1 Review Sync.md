### V1 Review Preparation

- Focus on last 4 years of healthcare sector developments
	- Exclude historical affordable care context
	- AI discussion only within healthcare lens context
- Competitor positioning slide consideration
	- Simple 2x2 matrix showing Virtue’s distinct sandbox
	- Differentiate from Flare, Defined, Teacap, Oak
	- Contrast with Primary, Box Group, First Round
- V2 content largely consistent, some updates needed

### Market Data and Content Requirements

- Sean to copy/paste slides with market-based information
- Market data collection needed for analysis
- Commentary development required
- Google Doc collaboration for additional content

### Loom Demo Timeline

- Target send date: August 4th week
- Dry run scheduled for next week
- Loose script development needed
- Review format more retrospective than forecasting
- 1-3 recording attempts anticipated (not 10 different runs)

### Portfolio Updates

- Q2 portfolio highlights needed
	- Focus on companies with public announcements only
	- 80% complete draft acceptable for Sean to finalize
- Brightwise and Ami exclusion decision
	- Save excitement for Q3 update
	- Test LP engagement by omitting from V1 review

### Personnel and Investment Updates

- Adam Zhao introduction
	- Met at Monday dinner, described as “smart dude”
	- Emre to schedule chat next week
- Granola fundraising update
	- Raised additional $400-500k
	- New total around $4.25M
- Quinn/Alex situation
	- Direct feedback call needed with Emre
	- “Alex was not it” - confusing performance
	- 20-30 minute three-way call planned for Monday/Tuesday

### Next Steps

- Emre: Call Quinn for direct feedback on Alex situation
- Emre: Work on LP update content over weekend
- Sean: Send slides and Google Doc materials
- Both: Coordinate group communications with Michael, Kevin, and incoming Raj
