## Slide 5: Healthcare data teams waste $1M+ annually wrestling with fragmented, low-quality data

Problem
Healthcare data teams waste
$1M+ annually wrestling with
fragmented, low-quality data

Healthcare data pain points:
1.  Multiple sources: Claims, EHR, HIE, Labs
2.  Multiple formats: CSV, JSON, XML, DB, PDF
3.  Persistent quality issues: Missing, invalid, duplicate, referential, implausible values
4.  Missing analytics-ready features

Result: Teams spend **80%** of time cleaning vs.
analyzing while wasting **$1M+** per year in resources.

## Slide 6: How do you go from 1 million+ codes to analytics-ready concepts?

**Value Based Care Providers**
ACOs, CINs, venture-backed
providers, etc., are using Tuva to
harmonize their claims, EHR, and
real-time clinical data, so they can
generate insights related to gaps in
care, avoidable events, risk
adjustment, and drivers of cost and
utilization, to manage patient
populations more effectively and
succeed in VBC.

and Value-based Care

MultiCare
Case Study

*   **~380k** Members
*   **~$700k** Year-1 Contract

Why they are adopting Tuva:
*   **Speed:** Takes months to ingest and transform data into analytics on current platforms
*   **Control:** Current platforms have limited ability to customize data model to meet their needs
*   **Transparency:** Struggled to validate reporting and data quality due to lack of transparency of black box data models

## Slide 14: Product Evolution - From Services to Software
