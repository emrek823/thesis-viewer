CLINICALLY VALIDATED GAMING EXPERIENCE. HJC has the potential to go beyond simple gamification and use true game design to create a new generation of clinically validated gaming experiences. The anonymity of these virtual communities and the ability to create an outward, digital persona that matches internal perception is a powerful tool. Clinical studies have shown this power (e.g., soldiers discussing PTSD) but HJC is the first to develop a scalable and accessible model.

Disproportionate HJC users in geos (South/Midwest) / communities (LGBTQIA, neurodivergent, etc.) whom both lack ACCESS, have COST constraints (group model cheaper than 1:1), and avoid TABOO/OPTICS receiving mental health care.

CLINICAL GRADE OUTCOMES: Equivalent-or-Better Outcomes Data (PHQ/GAD) – can we demonstrate that initial PHQ/GAD outcomes are at least equivalent to in-person and/or virtual therapy? If so, we make the ‘claim’ of our clinical grade robustness within this unique model. Intent = do not let them discredit clinical outcomes bc of unique delivery model.

$1T / 2.8B global gamers– BIG, GLOBAL TAM: Unique Global Market Opportunity (not available to 99% of healthcare cos). Very few VC-backed US-based healthcare startups – especially care delivery models – have the ability to scale internationally which has been a distinct factor limiting upside potential relative to non-healthcare tech deals. HJC possesses extreme market expansion potential relative to >99% of typical healthcare startups.

From Virtue memo: “Very few venture-backed US care delivery businesses can successfully expand globally. Most companies grow and are optimized for the intricacies of the US healthcare industrial complex, and often look to M&A in order to enter new geographies (e.g., Teladoc). HJC is focused on the US today, but has the potential to reach global scale over the next 5-10 years.”

UNTAPPED DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS: Gaming platforms & economies represent massive, low friction distribution channels; untapped mental health opportunity wrt high overlap between gaming & mental health disorder/illness; and, you won’t keep these people spending hours/day-week from gamin or these virtual communities so incumbent on meeting users where they are – traditional care delivery models have not cracked creative distribution like HJC.

Emphasis on untapped, high potential distru channels directly to the exact end user who needs HJC.

Can also touch on data and personalization that is possible with gaming channels, in addition to distribution. “New generation of tools for a new generation of needs. Enabling hyper-personalized mental health support, for every virtual comm

COMMUNITY CONTENT MODERATION & DIGITAL CIVILITY:

From Virtue memo “Harassment and cyberbullying increases churn, impacting user retention, revenue, and scalability. Companies today, such as Two Hat, provide content moderation services to help to classify and escalate real-time interactions between users. Two Hat, which analyzes >100B interactions every month, was recently acquired by Microsoft. As the industry continues to evolve, content moderation infrastructure is evolving from not only filtering out malicious behavior, but also intelligently catalyzing user engagement to become facilitators of shared digital experiences. This is especially crucial for the world of gaming, which primarily leverages a digital commerce-driven revenue model (e.g., micro-transactions, tipping) that benefits from users interacting with each other and sticking around.”

I’d consider emphasizing work done to date to ensure guardrails & foundation has since been built to ensure a safe & thriving HJC community.

CASH EFFICIENT MODEL: Cash efficient and (relatively) high gross margin care delivery business. Every VC places a premium on ‘capital efficient’ businesses today – from our memo: “A strong community, brand, NPS and high quality clinical care will reduce customer acquisition costs over the near and long-term. Today, HJC is able to acquire patients cost-effectively with gamer keywords that have a lower CAC ($30-$80) than mental health ($200+)... The company pairs this acquisition muscle with strong unit economics of a group based model (50%-70% gross margins) and strong retention (4:1 LTV / CAC ratios)”

HJC (as of April-23) has already exceeded our expectations: LTV/CAC: 9x (6x net) - Last month was 14.27x (6.66x net); Payback period: 3 weeks (previously 3.33 weeks) —> net payback 4.5 weeks; Avg blended LTV: 27 sessions (across all cohorts) - increased from 23.3!! (retention continues to go up across our cohorts).

CURRENT SOLUTIONS IGNORE MASSIVE MARKET. Most of the mental health space has been focused on serving primarily high-socioeconomic, educated, and urban elite demographics because that’s the population that has traditionally been able to pay out of pocket for therapy. It’s also reflected in the therapist population, which is 76% middle-aged white women who primarily serve middle-aged white women.

Brian’s text:

Quick update on on Benchmark and also a weird ask:

We’re going to get introduced to Scott Belskey, who used to be a venture partner at Benchmark to get is feedback on the company and then make an intro to the best partner for this deal.

Considering they don’t really do a bunch of healthcare, I need to put together a quick blurb with compelling bullet points that will convince them to take the call with us.

Since you’re so good at this and seen this so often, could you help me outline what you think would be the most compelling intro blurb, given all of the metrics and outcomes that we have so far. Nothing polished or final, but which stats you think would be the most compelling to a Benchmark that you’d put from and center

Hero Journey Club (HJC) provides evidence-based, community-first support groups that are designed to engage members within digital spaces like Discord, Minecraft, and Roblox. We’ve validated key hypotheses from our seed round with our novel approach to tackling the $100B+ market for mental health in adolescents, GenZ, and millennials.

Gen Z spends a significant portion of their leisure and connection time in virtual spaces, which have become the defacto social networks for many. By taking mental health out of the clinic and into the spaces where people already convene, we have driven deep engagement from our members (recent retention + LTV metrics).
