# GLP-1 Creates Eight Distinct Investment Verticals Beyond Drug Manufacturing

**Lead take:** The $156B GLP-1 market by 2030 is creating derivative opportunities that dwarf the drug economics alone. Eight investment verticals are emerging: (1) manufacturing infrastructure, (2) delivery innovation, (3) employer cost management, (4) digital adherence platforms, (5) muscle preservation/sarcopenia, (6) post-weight-loss consumer, (7) food/CPG reformulation, and (8) bariatric surgery alternatives. The highest-conviction opportunities are in infrastructure (#1-2) and the "GLP-1 companion" stack (#4-5), where market structure is still forming.

**Market context:**
- GLP-1 market: $53B (2024) → $156B (2030) at 23% CAGR
- Anti-obesity segment alone: $60-100B by end of decade
- 35% of US food/beverage sales by 2030 will be from GLP-1 households (up from 23% today)
- Bariatric surgery volumes down 25% since 2022; 15% further decline expected by 2034

## Opportunity 1: Manufacturing & Bio-Infrastructure

**The constraint:** Demand growing ~3x faster than manufacturing capacity. Chronic peptide shortages despite FDA resolution of semaglutide shortage (Feb 2025).

**Investment thesis:** Specialist peptide producers and CDMOs building low-cost, high-output GLP-1 capabilities become strategic partners to Novo/Lilly and biosimilar entrants. Winner-take-most dynamics as pharma consolidates supply chains.

**Specific opportunities:**
- Contract manufacturers with peptide capacity expansion
- Cloud-native biomanufacturing software (e.g., Culture Biosciences)
- Biosimilar enablers as semaglutide patents expire in India/China (2026)

**Market signals:**
- 2024 saw $30B+ in GLP-1 related alliances and acquisitions [[Evaluate obesity dealmaking report]]
- China biosimilar players out-licensing to Western pharma at premium terms
- Peptide CDMO valuations at 15-20x revenue in recent transactions

---

## Opportunity 2: Delivery Innovation

**The problem:** Injectable administration limits patient pool. 82% of users report GI events; up to 50% discontinue due to side effects.

**Investment thesis:** Oral formulations, transdermal patches, and robotic capsules expand addressable market by 2-3x while improving adherence. First oral GLP-1 approved Dec 2025 at $149/month validates format shift.

**Specific technologies:**
- Oral delivery systems (OASIS-1, orforglipron by Lilly expected Q2 2026)
- Transdermal patches maintaining flat plasma levels
- Self-injecting robotic capsules
- Programmable microneedle patches
- Self-orienting gastric injections

**Market signals:**
- Goldman projects pills capture 24% of $22B global weight loss market by 2030 [[2025-12-22-fda-approves-first-glp-1-pill]]
- Hims acquired peptide facility + lab testing to build full-stack oral/injectable capability [[2025-12-23-hims-hers-to-offer-at-home-blood-draws]]
- Side effect mitigation = adherence advantage = defensible moat

---

## Opportunity 3: Employer Cost Management

**The problem:** PMPM costs: $1.43 (2019) → $24.59 (2024) — 77% CAGR. 77% of large employers say managing GLP-1 costs is "extremely important." 64% still don't cover.

**Investment thesis:** Employers are caught between employee demand and unsustainable cost trajectories. Multiple models emerging: cooperative purchasing (Andel), financial guarantees (Cigna EncircleRx, WriteWise), direct-to-employer (Lilly D2E), Rx-only stop-loss.

**Funded players:**
- [Andel](https://techfundingnews.com/andel-raises-4-5m-to-close-glp1-coverage-gap/) — $4.5M, pools employer demand, bypasses PBMs, launching nationwide early 2026
- Cigna EncircleRx — 9M enrollees, 15% annual cost cap guarantee
- WriteWise (Virtue portfolio) — PMPM guarantees + Rx stop-loss, 4% loss ratio

**Market signals:**
- Lilly launching D2E model early 2026 [[FierceHealthcare]]
- HCA dropped coverage, directing to manufacturer D2C programs [[STAT News Dec 2025]]
- Employer GLP-1 carve-out demand accelerating

---

## Opportunity 4: Digital Adherence & Companion Platforms

**The problem:** Only 50% adherent at 12 months; 75% discontinue by year two. Two-thirds of weight regained within one year off medication without behavioral support.

**Investment thesis:** GLP-1s evolve into "therapy-as-service" packages where platform ownership of patient behavior loops drives long-term success. Companion apps become required by payors/employers to manage spend.

**Funded players ($2.8B total VC in category):**
- Noom GLP-1 Companion — FDA PDURS pathway, AI-driven calorie goals, side effect tracking
- Omada Health — PBM integration, lifestyle modification requirement
- Found — 250K+ members, medication + behavioral coaching
- Sidekick Health — digital companions with titration guidance

**Market signals:**
- FDA draft guidance on PDURS (Prescription Drug Use-Related Software) creates regulatory pathway [[Noom Jan 2025]]
- [92% 12-week persistence rate](https://www.evernorth.com/articles/evernorth-announces-industry-first-financial-guarantee-glp-1-spend) with EncircleRx + Omada lifestyle integration
- Insurers increasingly requiring lifestyle program participation for coverage

**Key insight:** The adherence monitoring infrastructure (apps, diagnostics, titration tools) is still fragmented. Consolidation opportunity exists.

---

## Opportunity 5: Muscle Preservation & Sarcopenia Mitigation

**The problem:** Up to 40% of weight lost on GLP-1s is lean mass. Older populations at high risk for sarcopenia.

**Investment thesis:** Protein supplementation, muscle-preserving compounds, and real-time protein monitoring become standard adjuncts to GLP-1 therapy. First-mover advantage in establishing clinical evidence for combination protocols.

**Specific opportunities:**
- Protein supplements targeting GLP-1 users (HMB, leucine, BCAAs)
- Combination therapies (bimagrumab + semaglutide in BELIEVE study)
- Continuous protein sensors for sarcopenia management
- Resistance training programs designed for GLP-1 users

**Market signals:**
- [American Diabetes Association](https://diabetes.org/newsroom/press-releases/new-glp-1-therapies-enhance-quality-weight-loss-improving-muscle-0) featuring bimagrumab combination data at 85th Scientific Sessions
- Evidence supports protein intakes ≥1.2-1.5 g/kg/day to counteract anabolic resistance [[ScienceDirect review]]
- Metagenics and supplement industry positioning for "GLP-1 companion" nutrition products

**Key insight:** This is a greenfield opportunity. No dominant player has emerged in the "muscle preservation for GLP-1 users" category.

---

## Opportunity 6: Post-Weight-Loss Consumer Ecosystem

**The problem:** 60% of GLP-1 users exercise more; behavior changes persist even after medication discontinuation. New identity requires new products/services.

**Investment thesis:** Companies serving "life after weight loss" — fitness, apparel, nutrition — capture sustained behavioral change. Not cyclical wellness spending but permanent lifestyle shift.

**Market sizing:**
- Secondhand apparel: $73B by 2028 (women's small-sized shirt sales up 12% 2022-2024)
- Fitness/wellness: gym membership surge among GLP-1 users
- Wearables: Whoop, Oura, CGM adoption for metabolic tracking

**Specific opportunities:**
- Premium protein-forward meal delivery
- Muscle-building fitness programs designed for post-weight-loss bodies
- Body recomposition tracking (DEXA, bioimpedance at scale)
- Weight maintenance-focused food services

**Portfolio angle:** Oxford Medical Products (Sirona hydrogel for weight maintenance at 50% lower cost) cited as example [[Ada Ventures]]

---

## Opportunity 7: Food/CPG Reformulation

**The problem:** GLP-1 users spend differently: fewer calories, more protein-forward, portion-controlled. 35% of food/beverage sales by 2030.

**Investment thesis:** CPG brands reformulating for "GLP-1 friendly" positioning capture growing cohort. First-movers in labeling, portion sizing, and protein content gain shelf advantage.

**Market signals:**
- [Circana](https://www.circana.com/post/glp-1-medication-users-to-represent-35-percent-of-u-s-food-and-beverage-sales-by-2030): 23% of US households now use GLP-1s; 35% of food/beverage units by 2030
- Smoothie King launched "GLP-1 Support Menu"
- Protein, fiber, low-sugar positioning becoming standard
- CPG spending normalized after initial 3-month decline (only -1% net after 12 months)

**Specific opportunities:**
- High-protein, portion-controlled meal brands
- "GLP-1 Friendly" certification/labeling
- Restaurant menu reformulation consulting
- Protein-forward snack innovation

**Key insight:** CPG impact less severe than feared (spending recovers), but composition shift is real. Protein wins, ultra-processed loses.

---

## Opportunity 8: Bariatric Surgery Alternatives

**The problem:** Bariatric surgery volumes down 25% since 2022. Programs closing nationwide.

**Investment thesis:** Surgical procedures pivot to GLP-1 non-responders and combination therapies. Endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (ESG) emerges as middle option.

**Market signals:**
- [Mass General Brigham](https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/study-finds-bariatric-surgery-declined-with-rise-in-glp-1-drugs): 25.6% decrease in non-diabetic bariatric surgery in 12 months
- Vizient projects 15% further decline by 2034 [[PBMI research]]
- Some surgeons down from 180 to 120 annual procedures
- Counterpoint: "rising tides effect" may increase surgical volume long-term as obesity recognized as disease

**Specific opportunities:**
- Endoscopic alternatives (ESG, balloon)
- GLP-1 + surgery combination protocols
- Surgical rescue for GLP-1 failures/plateaus
- Body contouring post-major weight loss
