The New World of Commercial Analytics
eBook

Specialty drugs have experienced massive growth over the past decade. In 2021, they accounted for half of the $603B total prescription drug spending in the US, up from 24% in 2007.¹ This trend is expected to continue: specialty drugs account for 75 percent of the approximately 7,000 prescription drugs currently in development, and nearly two-thirds of the 600 drugs expected to win FDA approval by 2022 are specialty drugs.²

Aggregating data from individual specialty pharmacies is necessary to understand the distribution and usage of these drugs, as claims data does not adequately track specialty drug usage. However, this process can be challenging due to different specialty pharmacies' diverse systems and formats. To connect siloed data, tokenization and patient matching technologies have become essential. Tokenization involves converting sensitive patient-level data into unique identifiers or tokens, enabling the compliant linkage of multiple datasets while preserving patient privacy.

Moreover, there is immense value in linking specialty pharmacy data with real-world data (RWD) to unlock unique insights and capabilities. By connecting these datasets, life science companies can better understand the effectiveness, safety, and real-world outcomes associated with specialty drugs. The unique insights and capabilities unlocked by linking SP data, first party data, and RWD will be covered in the following sections.

The New World of Commercial Analytics
eBook

There are 6 key players that play pivotal roles in the process of linking SP data with first party data (such as patient hub data) and RWD. Let's take a quick look at who is involved in this workflow:

1.  **Life Sciences Organizations**
    Life science companies maintain various first party data sets including patient hub data, patient registries or clinical study data. The life science company is the center of this workflow, looking to generate novel insights about its patient groups by linking their first party data with SP data and RWD.
2.  **Specialty Pharmacies**
    A Specialty Pharmacy (SP) is a type of pharmacy that provides medications and services for patients with complex, chronic, or rare medical conditions. Specialty pharmacies typically offer specialized services not available at traditional retail pharmacies. SPs provide access to specialty medications, personalized care to patients, coordinate care with health care providers, and manage insurance and financial assistance programs. SPs can also provide hub and patient assistance services.
3.  **Specialty Pharmacy Aggregators (SPA)**
    A specialty pharmacy aggregator (SPA) is a company that works with life science companies to aggregate data from the multiple specialty pharmacies that support a brand. SPAs provide a single platform for managing specialty medication distribution and patient care services. The aggregator typically provides technology and services to manage the supply chain, finances, and clinical programs of the specialty pharmacies that it partners with. The main benefit of a specialty pharmacy aggregator is that it allows life science companies to see how their drug is being used and distributed.
4.  **Data Connectivity Platforms**
    Data connectivity platforms enable organizations to connect disparate datasets at the patient level while preserving patient privacy. Once the datasets are connected, organizations can then do analytics to yield insights across numerous use cases such as patient adherence, targeting and triggers, and informing future drug development.
5.  **Analytics Platforms**
    Analytics platforms are software tools or platforms designed to analyze and interpret data, providing life sciences organizations with the means to process, analyze, visualize, and draw insights from data. Life sciences organizations may build and manage their own analytics platforms, or they may use third parties to provide analytics technology and/or services.
6.  **RWD Partners**
    RWD sources provide the underlying patient data that enriches the SP data and fills in the patient journey. The patient journey is a comprehensive view of the various interactions an individual has with the healthcare system. It encompasses their various touch points including diagnosis, treatment, follow-up, and potential outcomes. These interactions are captured by various RWD sources such as claims, lab, genomics or EHR data sets.

## Page 5: Current Landscape

The New World of Commercial Analytics
eBook

The development of specialty drugs has seen a rapid increase in the past decade with SP drugs making up to 53% of total drug spending in 2021. In addition, more than 50% of new FDA drug approvals since 2010 have been specialty drugs¹. This rapid shift to specialty drugs has been a boon for patients with rare diseases that previously had limited available treatments.

As more patients transition to being supported by specialty pharmacies, there has been a downstream effect to life science companies: an increased fragmentation of data. While standard datasets (claims, EHR) can adequately capture longitudinal patient journeys for broad disease treatment, specialty drug data managed by specialty pharmacies is siloed within various pharmacy networks.

This siloed and fragmented data greatly impedes the creation of a truly complete patient journey, making it difficult to draw data-driven conclusions about drug adherence, switching behaviors, reimbursement efforts, and the efficacy of patient support programs.

In recent years, specialty pharmacy aggregators have stepped in to bring disparate SP data sets together. But there are still gaps, as not all specialty drugs see 100% coverage even with aggregation – requiring pharmaceutical companies to supplement with claims data. Even after taking the necessary steps of working with an aggregator and potentially supplementing with claims data, there are still many unanswered questions left when linking new aggregated datasets with first party data.

Linking specialty pharmacy aggregation data with patient hub data is a good first step, but doesn't unlock the full potential of what is possible.

Using specialty drug and patient hub data alone only lets you see the patient while on treatment. This is an incomplete view of the patient journey.

*   During therapy initiation, you would not have a view into the patient journey prior to the start of therapy.
*   With a lack of adherence tracking, you would be limited in understanding the causes behind drop-offs and switches.
*   It's difficult to establish a safety profile without insights into comorbidities or concomitant therapies impacting reimbursements.
*   Without the right data to monitor the provider prescribing and referral patterns, you would have trouble optimizing sales.

Connecting RWD to fill in these gaps requires sifting through hundreds of different available RWD sources. Without the right tools, determining the best fit-for-purpose data sets can be a lengthy and expensive process.

### The Landscape: You are Buying and Generating Patient-Level Data

## Page 7: The Value of Linking SP Data for Life Science Companies

The New World of Commercial Analytics
eBook

Patients on specialty drugs have complex treatment pathways and require support throughout their time on treatment. Many life science companies are already tokenizing and linking data across their different specialty pharmacies and patient hub data sets when launching a specialty pharmacy distributed drug.

However, this strategy only allows you to see patients within your specialty pharmacy distribution network.

Advanced integration and connectivity of SP and patient hub data to RWD enriches insights and improves patient outcomes by impacting decisions made prior to the start of treatment, during treatment and after treatment.

### Before Treatment

*   **Improve Targeting and Triggers:** Identify physicians treating patients who are likely to benefit from treatment. Make this possible by using your specialty pharmacy data to train a predictive model based on lab, claims, and SDOH data predictive of patients on therapy. Once developed, you can deploy the model on new lab, claims, and SDOH data to identify physicians treating patients likely to benefit from treatment. These triggers enable an LS company to optimize its sales, medical affairs, and medical science liaison teams' deployment in the field and conduct targeted outreach to HCPs.

### While on Treatment

*   **Understanding Attrition:** Linking to relevant RWD sources can yield insights on why patients are stopping or switching therapies, enabling you to optimize your patient adherence plan.
*   **Enhance Adherence:** By grasping the specific challenges patients face when following a treatment regimen, you can craft more effective support programs and optimize interventions throughout treatment, ultimately boosting therapy adherence.

### After Treatment

*   **Maximize Reimbursements:** Generate real-world evidence on the effectiveness of your therapy compared to alternative treatments, and use this RWE to support a higher formulary position, better reimbursement, and optimal drug pricing.
*   **Facilitate Future Drug Development:** Gain insights into the effectiveness, safety, and off-label drug usage to support label expansion while reducing drug development costs.
*   **Optimize Patient Assistance Programs (PAPs):** Leverage comprehensive insights into patient behavior, treatment effectiveness, and adherence patterns to create user clusters. Together with a fuller understanding of the patient journey you can deliver personalized messaging and support to improve patient engagement and optimize outcomes. Ultimately, you can use this level of comprehensive insight to streamline your PAPs, efficiently deploying resources while maximizing impact and cost-effectiveness.

## Page 9: Workflows

The New World of Commercial Analytics
eBook

The following are a selection of workflows from top life science companies who have partnered with Datavant to link their first party data, SP data, and additional 3rd party data such as claims data to enhance their commercial growth.

### Improve Targeting and Triggers
IPM.AI + Top Life Science Company

**Problem**
A pharmaceutical company developed an FDA-approved therapy targeting an ultra-rare hereditary disease (less than 6,500 patients in the US). The company wanted to reduce the time to correctly diagnose patients and identify those who are appropriate candidates for therapy. To aid in diagnosing the ultra-rare disease patients, the pharma company required:
*   A model to profile these ultra-rare disease patients and the specialists likely to see them
*   A diagnostic support tool to help specialists correctly diagnose patients with the disease
*   Both the model and the diagnostic support tool required different data types and sources to provide a complete, longitudinal view of the patient

**Solution**
The pharma company partnered with IPM.AI and Datavant to identify and evaluate data sources in the Datavant Ecosystem that have clinical, claims, or genomics data on patients with the ultra-rare disease. Once the data sources were selected, Datavant enabled the de-identification, tokenization, and linkage of those data sources and distribution to IPM.AI.
IPM.AI then used the aggregated data set to construct the patient profile model and diagnostic support tool.

**Results**
The profile model and diagnostic support tool enabled the pharma company to implement targeted education, outreach, and training to specialists, resulting in a significant increase in diagnostic testing for the ultra-rare disease. 66 additional patients were diagnosed, increasing their likelihood of receiving the necessary therapy before their disease progressed to a more critical stage.

## Page 10: Enhance Adherence

The New World of Commercial Analytics
eBook

**Problem**
Non-adherence to treatment protocols is a major problem in the healthcare industry, affecting 50-60% of patients and resulting in an estimated 125k deaths and $290B in healthcare costs each year.³ A top 20 pharma company with an infusion therapy noticed that a significant percentage of patients were stopping treatment, despite receiving assistance through a variety of patient support programs. The company wanted to better understand the reasons behind patients stopping therapy so that they can develop more effective intervention methods to improve the adherence rate.

**Solution**
The pharma company used Datavant to find and connect claims data and social determinants of health (SDOH) data and connect it to their specialty pharmacy and patient support program data. Datavant tokenized the pharma company's data, matched patients across disparate data sets, and linked the data sets at the patient level. This allowed the pharma company to analyze cohorts of patients to identify factors driving non-adherence, including adverse events, cost barriers, and comorbidities.

**Results**
By linking and analyzing proprietary data with real-world data, the pharma company revealed that non-adherence was due to the emergence of a new oral therapy which was more convenient for patients to administer. Based on this insight, the company allocated resources to patient services to make it easier for patients to travel to an infusion center. The company also refined provider messaging and field strategies to highlight the long-term benefits of the infusion therapy compared to the competing oral drug.

## Page 11: Maximize Reimbursements

The New World of Commercial Analytics
eBook

**Problem**
A top pharmaceutical company was looking to expand reimbursement and coverage for a rare gastroenterology indication by evaluating additional clinical outcomes via a health economics and outcomes research (HEOR) study.
HEOR helps to provide clinical evidence of outcomes or improved outcomes compared to other treatments for the purpose of reimbursement and coverage for patients to get access.

**Solution**
In order to facilitate the HEOR study and provide adequate data for the research, the pharma company used Datavant to tokenize their first party gastroenterology patient hub data and specialty pharmacy data feeds, as well as source and tokenize claims data. By utilizing Datavant to de-identify, tokenize and link all of those data sources, the HEOR team at the pharma company was able to conduct a thorough study. This combined data set also became a valuable resource for the commercial team supporting the growth of this therapy.

**Results**
By linking first party data with specialty pharmacy and claims data, the pharmaceutical company was able to create a robust data set, which was used by the HEOR team to examine and discover an additional set of positive clinical outcomes, which supported negotiations to expand coverage and reimbursement for their gastroenterology treatment.

## Page 12: Facilitate Future Drug Development

The New World of Commercial Analytics
eBook

**Problem**
A pharma company was exploring label expansion for one of their existing rare disease drugs. Due to ethical concerns about using placebos on rare disease patients, the pharmaceutical company wanted to assess the feasibility of building an external (synthetic) control arm. However, the population of patients suffering from this rare disease was very small, and an adequate sample needed to validate the external control arm could not be captured from one single Electronic Health Record (EHR) data set. They were advised by the FDA that data aggregated from multiple sources would only be accepted if they could demonstrate that there were no duplicate patients in the final data set.

**Solution**
The pharma company used Datavant to find and connect three different EHR data sources that each had a partial population of patients suffering from this rare disease. Each EHR data source tokenized their data on the Datavant token and delivered the cohort to the pharma company. Using a shared token schema, the pharma company was able to combine all three datasets and seamlessly de-duplicate patients.
The pharma company then linked the aggregated EHR data set to their specialty pharmacy data to ensure that patients in the EHR data sources were not on the drug of interest.

**Results**
By linking three separate EHR data sources together, the pharmaceutical company was able to successfully generate a sufficiently large data set to serve as an external control arm. The pharma company avoided having to double the size of their clinical trial to include a placebo control group, significantly saving time and money compared with a traditional control arm.
