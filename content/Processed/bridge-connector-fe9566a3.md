Building integrations

We had to build a net new connector. 2/3/4 month exercise for each new connector

Others

Static APIs or proprietary connectors

Implementation enablement

Keep control of their own data

Integration exercise is a couple $M

Deloitee

Redox - reliant on the redox model and expanding that

Graphie

OpenCEM

Not mapped to anything

Underlying Flowgami - model is a brain is constantly learning

Flows

Map builder

Specific mapping to that providers EHR instance

Dynamic documentation

Tweak APIs to make them customized

Redox

When thecompany wants to expand their use case

Everry time they reconfigure it they want to expand their use case

Redox solveed this

I want to spin up this new analytics tool that your APi doesn’t support. Expand that to the health systems specific mapping of the instance. Health system controls what they expose to any source

Health gorilla / Particle

Not bi-directional

HL7

HIN

Labs

Particle came and wanted bi-directoinallity

Health systems, integrators, digital health companies use FLowgami for hub of APIs

When health system buys new tech - not a 6 month exercise to figure out how people work with it

See how rapidly it enhances development and subject matter expertise which is where it breaks down

ACV

Per source per year

Maintenance

Humana has over 2000 sources

Build into Epic App Orchard

How do I map to my common data model

TGH send me patient and that’s in Epic FHIR data model. I have to convert t

People will build on top of FHIR. But it’s a recommendation

Trying to be bi-directional

Because data isn’t that structured they

FHIR - singular vs. full patient record

You can stack different things on top of it. You can buy patient iD - give them idea of where

Redox built connections b/t health systems

BEtter than redox

FHIR doesn’t get adopted quick enough when there’s a world

Bi-directional

Pipes into health systems or PCPs. I want to build those pipes myself

Switchboard is talkign to PCP built on top of Elation

Crossover is not working with Particle

Build on top of Elation APIs. Here’s Elation SDK. Let me pull that into my tech stack and code against it. How does patient name exist in Elation vs. Epic (patient.lastname, plus a whole different

How could business not have supported term of that loan?

Business must have been flawed in some way

Not sustainable growth opportunities and ways of getting things done

Did he know that? What was he reporting to the board? Was the board not fully privy?

What doesn’t make sense is how many sales + what they were claiming?

Why does he build this on CC?

Surrounding yourself with friends

Going faster than you should

Not pushing back to your board

That then results in reputational

Not admitting his mistakes / blaming the board

As soon as they get QHIN designation, we can connect ot everything and they can’t say no
