### Luro Health Progress Update

- Steve from Luro Health provided progress update since October conversation
- Signed contracts with 3 FQHC centers (first center July launch)
	- Civic Health (Philadelphia)
	- Philadelphia Fight
	- Little River (2-month sales cycle vs 9 months for first center)
- Achieved 10-year contracts with 2nd and 3rd centers
	- Advisor noted this typically takes 5 years to secure
	- Enables nationally preferred vendor status
- Beating commercial weight management conversion rates with Medicare/Medicaid population
- July enrollment: 170 patients (expected 24)
	- 47-48% adherence rate vs 18% industry standard for Medicaid
	- 88% follow-on session rate after initial clinical sessions

### Business Model & Operations

- Fully turnkey, white-labeled obesity management programs for FQHCs
	- Zero upfront cost to centers
	- Complete EHR integration (single-button referral)
	- Custom marketing materials, websites, patient messaging
	- 24-hour patient response goal (currently working toward same-day)
- Revenue model leverages PPS billing rates
	- Targeting 13 states with 340B carve-ins and high PPS rates
	- Recent federal legislation created tailwinds:
		- FQHCs losing revenue from decreased patients/grants
		- Connecticut passed $80M legislation increasing PPS rates
		- Dietitians now included in PPS billing

### Expansion Plans & Financing

- Current targets for end of next year:
	- 15 centers signed
	- $20M annualized run rate
- Raising $3M currently (significant portion committed)
- Phase 2: Expand to additional chronic conditions (diabetes, cardiovascular, cancer survivors)
- Long-term vision: Virtual behavior modification platform for all Medicare/Medicaid chronic conditions
- 2027 goal: 60 centers, 25,000 patients, $50M run rate

### Next Steps

- Steve to send updated deck within the hour
- Follow-up conversation later this week after Virtue completes current portfolio financing work
