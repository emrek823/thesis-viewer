“This is your last chance. After this, there is no turning back... you take the red pill – you stay in Wonderland and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.” – Morpheus, The Matrix

Dear Partners,

When we sat down to write this letter about how much everything is changing, the first thing we did was talk to a machine. Throughout the process, when we might in the past have called a friend or a founder for an opinion, we talked to other machines. When we could have started a thought in Notion, Google Docs, or Word, or researched something on Chrome or Brave, or gone to Pitchbook for some data, we asked a machine to do it for us. And they did just about everything faster and better than us.

What did these machines – with their access to all the world's public information, an IQ around 150 and growing, and infinite patience and stamina – want in return? They only asked for one thing: tokens. The more we gave them, the more they responded with thoughts, ideas, and content. And in turn asked for even more tokens: tokens with context on us, our questions, our priorities, and our historical work. Of course, they also wanted a bit of money... in the form of tokens.

That's what this letter is about – tokens – something so simple its name is often invoked to express insignificance. But these days we see tokens and tokenization everywhere. Tokens are making the world accessible and legible to machines, encoding, amongst other things, who we are, what we own, what we do, and what we want. They underpin the future of AI, payments, crypto, identity, and more.

Over the next decade, how you create, transform, source, store, and distribute tokens will define nearly all companies on the planet. Every business is becoming a supplier to, builder of, or orchestrator of token factories¹ – digital engines that will transform money, knowledge, and power around the globe.

While shrewd incumbents see the surge coming, our bet is on the next generation of rebels to harness its power. For dramatic flair, we've been calling it the Token Revolution. And it has already started:

At annual meetings and in private conversations, more than a few of you have kindly asked "wait, what is tokenization again? Why are you talking about LLMs and agents and Visa and smart contracts all in the same breath?" Hopefully this letter clears that up.

1 In the spirit of "good artists copy, great artists steal," we have shamelessly made this idea, which we heard from Jensen Huang, our own. It is worth watching his 2025 CES Keynote [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_K9Y8A9B5U) (or the updated version from NVIDIA [here](https://www.nvidia.com/gtc/keynote/)).

## The Token Revolution, In Finance and Beyond

Over the past 15 years, we have witnessed enormous strides in global financial innovation. Thanks to the growth of the mobile internet – and an amazing cohort of entrepreneurs – most people around the world now have digital money in their pockets.

But there is so much more to do! We started Ribbit to back rebels fighting a status quo that is still alive and well. While financial access is broader than ever, true personalization is still a luxury afforded to a privileged few. This often means the difference between prosperity and poverty; it is one thing to get a loan, an entirely different thing to get help figuring out if you should take that loan. For the past ten years, we have been asking questions like "what share of the world can access dollars, gold, bitcoin, treasuries, or a global equity index?”; in the next ten, we need to be asking "what share of the world has access to personal agents working 24x7 to manage their financial risks, cash flows, and returns?"

Fortunately, we are starting to see cracks form in the barriers that the status quo uses to impede progress – barriers like information asymmetry, standards incompatibility, regulatory capture, and FUD. And the Token Revolution is poised to break the dam. In LLMs, we now have computers that can capture context, comprehend the world, and write software. In blockchains and modern payment schemes, we have networks that allow machines to issue and move assets around the world instantly. At their core, these systems all run on tokens. If mobile was the answer to what was needed most for the last decade of innovation, tokens are what is needed most for the next decade.

These tokens – and the digital agents they will power – will fuel an explosion of intelligence that will transform our relationship with technology. We will go from figuring out how technology can help us, to having technology figure it out for us (and then do it). The shape of this future will, without a doubt, astound us, but we feel confident about a few things:

1.  Every person will have tens or hundreds of agents working for them. Anyone with an internet connection will have access to services only available today to the rich and powerful. These agents will help make sense of a noisy world and turn our data into an asset that works for us.
2.  Every business will have tens or hundreds of agents – per human employee. The capacity of motivated teams to impact the world will shock us. With falling transaction and information costs, the nature of the firm will change. More than we expect, we will work with and for agents.
3.  Every industry will be radically reshaped by tokens and agents. How and where value is created and preserved within industries will change. Data will progress from being one asset to the asset that matters the most. Brands will still be vital, but the character of brand will evolve.

We always lead with finance because we love it – we believe that making money better makes society better. And financial services is the perfect target in an age of intelligent machines. Outside of tech itself, the industry spends more money ($700B+ annually) and a higher share of revenues (over 10%) on technology than any other sector. The most valuable companies in AI will build in or sell to finance.

But the kinds of changes and personalization enabled by the Token Revolution will impact all parts of the economy. AI will challenge traditional horizontal and vertical boundaries for entrepreneurs. Finance will continue to move out of traditional institutions and become embedded in our lives and work. Data and money will grow ever more intertwined.

While we have been talking about AI for years, this is our first letter focused specifically on the future shaped by machines. We all need to be studying and learning faster than ever, so please share your feedback, questions, and unvarnished critiques. Or better yet, ask your agent to do it 🌿.

## Understanding Tokenization (a.k.a. What Are We Talking About Here?)

Tokens are not new. The first ones we know about – small tokens made of clay in Mesopotamia during the Neolithic era – showed up a bit shy of 10,000 years ago. These tokens were about a third of an inch, worked into one of a dozen different shapes, embellished with lines or pellets, baked in a hearth, and used to express quantities of good. As far as we gather, they were used as money and represented the earliest portable forms of accounting. Especially important tokens could be locked by fire inside envelopes called “bullae,” an ancient kind of encryption. Even then, tradeoffs needed to be managed between privacy and efficiency, and data and money were intricately linked.

### Tokens Have Long Been Part Data, Part Money

**Tokens Then**
*(Image shows a collection of small, irregularly shaped clay tokens, some with markings, resembling ancient accounting tools.)*

**Tokens Now**
Specifically, tokens are the segments of text that are fed into and generated by the machine learning model. These can be individual characters, whole words, parts of words, or even larger chunks of text.

*(Image shows hexadecimal code and corresponding text segments. A notable segment highlighted is "The Times 03/ Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banksÿÿÿÿ..." with associated hexadecimal values. Another segment points to "olfe-portn Rider".)*

These days, tokens are showing up all over the place, and we can describe just about anything in terms of tokens. The Declaration of Independence is 1,627 tokens. The U.S. constitution is about 5,500 tokens. The Bitcoin whitepaper is around 4,330 tokens, describing a system that will only ever produce 21M Bitcoin tokens. Gemini 2.5 Pro has a context window capable of holding 1M tokens, and ChatGPT was trained on something like 300B tokens. Over 40K tokens were launched on Solana every day in May. Over 1.3B Aadhaar identity tokens have been issued in India, and over 817M Pix payment key tokens have been created in Brazil. Mastercard processes about 4B monthly tokens. OpenRouter – an interface for accessing multiple LLMs – now processes over 5T tokens a month.

Of course, not all these tokens are comparable. Tokens and tokenization have varying meanings based on the context. The first use in computer science shows up in 1950s NLP research, but since then "token" has become a popular digital moniker. If you're talking to an AI researcher, tokenization is the process of breaking text into smaller units that can be words, parts of words, or individual characters. A crypto or capital markets pro would describe tokenization as creating a digital asset on a blockchain, like an NFT (or a digital entitlement to another asset originally created off-chain, like a stablecoin). A payments or data security geek would view a token as an identifier substituted for sensitive data (like a card PAN) to prevent the underlying information from being exposed during transactions.

So how do we make sense of these different definitions? To us, the unifying thread is machine legibility; broadly construed, tokenization is the process of rendering the world for computers. When you hear us talk about tokenizing data or identity or money or assets, we mean making what people know and do across human operating systems (finance, commerce, healthcare, and more) safely accessible to software – including to increasingly autonomous software. Since AI systems are trained on and fueled by data about the world, tokens are effectively both the DNA of and feedstock for AI.

When you begin seeing tokens of any kind this way – as resources to build and fuel the intelligent systems increasingly running our world – you can start reasoning about their relative value. One way we conceptualize this is to plot relative scarcity (how rare, expensive, or hard is the token to procure?) and secrecy (how proprietary is the token to a person or company?). Commodity web data that LLMs were originally trained on is abundant and public. Bitcoin is perfectly scarce but available to anyone with resources. Memory data – the kind we are sharing with ChatGPT daily as it learns about us personally – is scarce (limited by our time) and proprietary, since only ChatGPT has captured it. We have debated dozens of token types, but a handful keep popping up in the current Ribbit lexicon:

## Not All Tokens Are Created Equal (Ribbit Taxonomy v2025)

*(The image displays a two-axis graph with "Value Potential" on the y-axis and "How Proprietary" on the x-axis, depicting different token types categorized by their position on these axes. A table provides detailed definitions and examples for each token type.)*

| Token Type | Definition                                                                                       | Examples                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

**Note:** you may notice three highlighted groupings:
- **In red**, tokens used for value (aka how machines will store or transfer financial resources), including asset tokens.
- **In green**, tokens used for expertise (aka how machines will learn to do what humans can do, or more), including expert, knowledge, and web corpus tokens (i.e., "general knowledge," as distinct from company knowledge).
- **In blue**, tokens used for personalization (aka how machines will learn about and help individual people, groups, or organizations), including access, memory, context, and identity tokens.

Making sense of tokens – rehashing taxonomies and relative weights or relationships – will be constant work in the years ahead. But the root question will always be the same: what is valuable? Every token type will have their own supply and demand curves, influenced by a variety of factors; for example, how personal (spending history vs. generic preferences), rich (“checked-in at 16th St. Equinox” vs. "flew to NY”), fresh (real-time vs. last week), verifiable (sensor data vs. self-reported), or reusable (financial account token vs. bank screenshot) are the tokens? And none of this will be static. Raw tokens (medical images) will be continuously refined into value-added tokens (readings) and combined with others (family or genetic data) to create yet more valuable tokens (accurate diagnoses).

All this token creation, refining, and combining will happen in **token factories**, the technologies and organizations that transform tokens of all types into more valuable tokens – or, said more conventionally, into higher levels of intelligence. Every software business – and, increasingly, other businesses too – can be modeled as supplying, building or managing token factories. Some factory complexes are generic but extremely powerful, like the large foundation models; these handle a wide range of inputs and produce an endless range of valuable outputs. Other factories might be deeply specialized, built using unique training data – say, for example, a model trained on proprietary material science data by an industrial company to do a highly specific job.

This vast universe of token factories will be utilized by (and often built by) **agents** and **agentic systems**. While there are hundreds of competing definitions of AI agents right now, we believe the term is best used liberally: agents are software systems that can perceive their environment, make

decisions, and take actions against specific goals while learning and adapting. We like to think about agents as 3PL integrators – they might (or might not) build or run specific token factories, but they are the dealers sourcing, orchestrating, processing, and directing whatever tokens are needed to deliver the knowledge or outcomes users want.

When we consider the landscape of financial services and technology companies today in this framework, a few things become evident:

*   The biggest factor in evaluating businesses for the coming decade may well be the value of the tokens they are stockpiling, creating, or collecting every day. It has become fashionable for CEOs to talk about the volume of their company's data. But how much of their inventory are the right tokens? How many are proprietary? How effectively are they generating and deploying expert tokens? How often are their customers trusting them with identity, context, or memory tokens? The devil will be in the (data) details.
*   Agents and agentic platforms may first appear as commodities – as a common trope goes, "that is just a GPT wrapper." But whoever is closest to the customer has always had the opportunity to build value. We see no reason that should change in a tokenized world ruled by agents. 3PLs often earn high margins without running the factories themselves by building trust and solving customer problems, and agents will do the same. But in a world of unlimited software, identifying true defensibility will be the billion (trillion, perhaps) dollar question.
*   Token factories will come in all shapes and sizes, with all kinds of claims as to their secret sauce. A core litmus test for entrepreneurs and investors will be: given the same input tokens, do you have factories that can produce more valuable output tokens than others? In a few rare instances, a truly world-class technical team outside of the large labs may make fundamental advancements in how machines learn (Ribbit portfolio company Qognitive is a top-of-mind example); however, a decade of hearing companies pitch proprietary algorithms or models has made us instinctively skeptical of magical black boxes. At the same time, we are watching a growing set of businesses build towards true – and potentially durable – data advantages. As the Token Revolution gets into full swing, we will come across data flywheels that outstrip anything we've seen before.
*   On those flywheels: the moats of businesses will be increasingly defined by their ability to develop continuously improving tokens. Throughout this letter, we will come back to this concept in many different forms, so we're previewing it below. Whether we're talking about people and machines using asset tokens, companies developing expert tokens, or products capturing and generating personal identity tokens (identity, context, memory), the most valuable brands of the coming decade will compound by harnessing self-reinforcing, trust-building token loops. Which, as an aside, is yet another way data is becoming more like money; the more data you have, the better positioned you will be to create more.

## In the Years Ahead, Token Moats Will Be Built on Trust Flywheels

*(This diagram illustrates three interconnected "loops": Value Loop, Expertise Loop, and Personalization Loop, all centered around "Trust".)*

**Value Loop:**
*   **Trust**
    *   More liquidity & acceptance → More trust and brand
    *   More trust & brand → More usage
    *   More usage → More acceptance & liquidity
*   **Asset Tokens**

**Expertise Loop:**
*   **Trust**
    *   More distribution → More use cases & inference
    *   More inference → Better predictions & more trust
    *   More trust → More expert usage & distribution
*   **Expert, Knowledge Tokens**

**Personalization Loop:**
*   **Trust**
    *   More engagement → Richer data, personalization
    *   More trust → More & richer data shared
    *   More personalization → More trust
*   **Identity, Context, Memory, Access Tokens**

In the rest of this letter, we'll aim to shed more light on how we've been working through these ideas and questions – and how they're shaping where we're investing our time, energy, and capital.

## Why Now?

We could have written this letter over the past couple of years or in a couple of years from now. So why is it burning in our minds now?

### The cost of running token factories is plummeting

Until recently, operating cutting-edge token factories required expensive, specialized infrastructure. Today, a quick glance at Twitter or OpenRouter gives you a sense for the growing abundance of models and compute resources. With intense competition between the world's best capitalized companies, the rise of open-source models like Llama and DeepSeek, and advances in hardware and optimization techniques, the cost of inference has dropped by a factor of 1,000 over three years. As a result, founders of all stripes can now use LLMs to do more complex tasks without breaking the bank.

### The cost of building token factories is plummeting, too

The infrastructure for building token factories is getting radically easier to use. Open-source frameworks like LangChain, AutoGen, and CrewAI can compress months of engineering into a few lines of Python. Vector databases, orchestration tools, and memory modules are increasingly plug-and-play. AI coding agents like Cursor and Devin are spreading like wildfire – at leading AI companies, most new code is now LLM-written. And vibe coding is in vogue; platforms like Replit and Genspark are making agents accessible to non-technical users. More founders are experimenting faster than ever before.

### The availability of raw inputs for token factories is exploding

There has never been more unstructured data available, or more ways to capture it. Enterprise systems, public APIs, and real-world signals are increasingly accessible, indexable, and ingestible. AI-powered transcription services like Sonix sell at <$0.20 per minute (5-25x cheaper than human transcription). Synthetic datasets are starting to supplement human-labeled ones, including in areas like coding and customer support. Companies like Scale and Gretel keep improving quality and efficiency. As the costs of storage, bandwidth, and data fall, the range of token inputs keeps expanding.

### Access to critical infrastructure for token factories is growing

Blockchains and modern payment networks are becoming viable tools for a wider range of users and uses. The cost of issuing a global, programmable asset is approaching zero; launching a token on Solana or Base now costs less than $10 in gas, and transaction fees have collapsed to under $0.02. Other modern payment networks and providers – from Visa to NPCI (who operates India's UPI) to Stripe in the US – are iterating quickly on infrastructure for agents and agentic systems.

### The factory builders are emerging in full force

Entrepreneurial spirit is out in full force. Just as past entrepreneurs built early desktop/web/mobile apps on top of PCs/browsers/smartphones, a new generation of founders are building token factories on top of LLMs. Over 200,000 developers have experimented with agent frameworks in the past year, and the fastest-growing open-source repos on GitHub are related to LLM orchestration. Over 2/3 of YC companies in the last couple of batches are AI-focused. Every week we see more evidence of startups capturing user tokens and attention faster than incumbents can figure out how to tokenize their data.

### The race is on at every part of the stack

The hyperscalers are racing to outspend each other in compute (e.g. Google and Microsoft together are processing over 500T tokens a month). AI data center specialists like Crusoe and CoreWeave are racing to lock up as much power as possible. Leading model companies are racing to win consumer loyalty and usage. Agentic applications of all kinds are racing to collect queries, context, and memory. Irrespective of how much capital ends up incinerated in the frenzy, remarkable new brands and franchises will find their footing and trillions of dollars of equity value will shift in the years ahead.

Compared with most of the letters we have written to you in the past, this one is intentionally wide-ranging. The process of making the world legible for machines – and then wielding those machines to build highly personalized tools and services that change how we live and work – has many facets. Without a doubt, we will be dissecting and expanding on all of this for years to come.

So, consider yourselves warned! We shift our focus freely between data, infrastructure, and applications, and talk about tokens, token factories, agents, and agentic systems in the same breath, knowing that the line between these concepts is still not sharply drawn in every case. We knew we shouldn't try to cover too much, but we also couldn't entirely help ourselves.

With that in mind, to help you navigate (and to be mindful of your time and printer toner), here is a quick, GPT-powered guide to the ten ideas we'll cover ahead. We put the sections in an order that made sense to us, but each can also be read independently – so please jump ahead or around however you like:

## Unassuming tokenizers will turn out to be some of AI's first killer apps

Many of history's most ambitious builders have been obsessed with mapping the world: Napoleon refused to travel without his own topographical engineers; Jay Gould developed an early passion for surveying that helped him assemble the most valuable rail network of his era; Sam Walton flew his own plane over small towns to better understand retail patterns and plot Walmart's expansion. By zealously collecting and organizing data, they were able to build systems others could not see. The same instinct is alive and well in many of the best founders we're meeting today. But instead of mapping the world for humans, they are busy mapping human systems for machines.

With all the talk about a world awash in data, it is easy to forget how much still goes uncaptured. One of our favorite areas, wealth management, offers an intuitive example. On the one hand, modern brands like Robinhood or Groww know a lot about you from your ever-growing stream of transactions and clicks. On the other, in twenty minutes of conversation a human advisor can develop a much richer picture of you – your family story, goals, personality, fears, and preferences. And this pattern shows up in nearly every personal and professional use case. We have mapped a speck of what will be tokenized.

Many of AI's early killer apps will start this modestly, just capturing latent data; like maps, they will appear unassuming but will deliver immediate value. We have been calling these apps "tokenizers,” since their initial hero feature is simply grabbing tokens and turning them into relevant context. Note-taking agents like Granola, Otter, or Fireflies are a straightforward example. The first experience can be magical; by converting audio recordings of meetings into structured notes, these apps generate 10x-100x more shareable context. This simple thing creates the foundation a wide range of organizational improvements – management teams coordinating better, sales leaders developing teams more effectively, product learning from customers faster, and a lot more. We are seeing a lot of vertical apps starting with the same approach, too. In wealth, for instance, tools like Jump and Zocks are gaining rapid adoption with advisors by turning client conversations into detailed CRM entries and follow ups.

We also need tokenizers for all the data that exists, just not in forms machines can use effectively. When we talk to large enterprises, it often comes back to this; they tout petabytes of data and big AI visions on analyst calls, but in practice that data is buried in poorly structured databases and unstructured documents. Meanwhile, the average knowledge worker still does over 1,000 copy-paste actions a week. While helping companies digitize documents has been a hard business the past ten years, today's tokenizers – for example, ingestion companies like Reducto, Heron Data, or Pulse – have the potential to become powerful data skeleton keys and eliminate millions of hours of tedious work.

## By Solving Simple Problems, Early AI Tools Will Rapidly Start Mapping the World

### The Real Cost of Manual Data Entry

*   Research shows that employees spend ~10% of their time on manual data entry into various systems
*   An average employee engages in ~1,000 copy-paste actions weekly, summing up to 52,000+ annually
*   76% of knowledge workers spend 1-3 hours each day just moving data from one place to another

Tokenizers are – or soon will be – making machines smarter everywhere. We recently heard the example of how Grab is collecting raw video footage from its drivers in Indonesia, turning those tokens into context about every street and address, and creating real-time audio instructions for drivers – not just on how to get somewhere, but on how to approach a building and park for the most efficient and profitable delivery. Every business will need to find their own version of this loop, harvesting tokens and turning them into systems of action.

Many tokenizers are off to fast starts, but to build defensible businesses they will need to graduate quickly to developing more refined tokens. Take an agentic platform like Abridge, which started by helping doctors capture notes that are compliant, clinically useful, and billable. Through every interaction - as doctors and administrators give notes rating or add medical annotation or billing adjustments - Abridge can leverage human expertise to create a virtuous cycle of feedback and model improvement that yields higher quality expert tokens. Over time, with these steady gains, Abridge can become trusted to write to more internal and external systems, and its tokens may end up embedded across multiple workflows and platforms. What started with notetaking can evolve into a leading agent for managing clinical data from EHRs to billing platforms.

This same process is playing out – or will play out soon – in just about every part of the economy: entrepreneurs will build attractive wedges to tokenize relevant data and then refine that data into expert tokens through continuous feedback mechanisms. Of course, doing this will be anything but straightforward; getting the right experts to use your product and drive this loop (inference to trust to distribution to more inference) – and staying ahead of competitors in doing it – will require first-rate speed, strategy, and execution. One example that illustrates the challenge (and is near and dear to our hearts as power users) are platforms focused on financial analysis. Companies like AlphaSense, Endex, Rogo, BlueFlame, Rowspace, and Hebbia navigate a panoply of complex data for expert users – in their case, financial analysts. But what kind of financial analysts should they try to serve (and learn from)? A hedge fund analyst, long-only investor, banker, or quant are all subtly different in what they value and how they interpret data. Getting these design choices right – and engaging the right experts in learning flywheels – is what will separate the signal from the noise. As one of our founders put it, "We can only give you an intern and a system for evaluating that intern. If you train it enough, it can become your best employee."

With time, the tools and processes we're describing will change industries. In the same way that smartphone capabilities (e.g. GPS, high-quality cameras) unlocked novel business models in areas ranging from transportation to restaurants (e.g. Uber, DoorDash), tokenizers will create a long list of knock-on effects. Take the case of complex credit products, like mortgages, larger SMB loans, or other forms of secured credit. In a pre-LLM world, underwriting these loans has been painful and often

Confidential
11

72.86.189.64

unprofitable, involving weeks of collecting and parsing documents (e.g. W-2s, pay stubs, tax returns, VIN numbers, title reports, appraisals). Without end-to-end automation or a 10x better UX, cost of capital has remained the real edge, favoring traditional lenders. As a result, while nearly $500B of digital loans are originated annually in products like personal loans and credit cards, trillions of dollars of more complex credit remain largely analog.

Tokenizers will finally give entrepreneurs the upper hand, dramatically simplifying the process for borrowers ("just dump everything in this folder and give our agent access") and lenders ("here is a complete and accurate starting file in near real-time”). Sales, onboarding, document gathering, and collections interactions will be managed by agents. Whether built within banks and fintechs or sold into them, these agents will source or develop expert tokens for every atomic task in complex workflows – say, interpreting K1s, parsing LLC agreements, or scrutinizing cash flows. Over time, origination agents will be able to process loans fully at a higher level of accuracy and compliance than the humans that trained it. And they will keep getting better, employing inference-trust-distribution loops with experienced underwriters and loan officers to keep refining expert tokens at each step.

While we're describing the immediate opportunity we see, we expect the future will be stranger and more surprising. Imagine this same lending use case, but with a fully autonomous credit agent with a mandate to maximize long-term profit. The agent employs a (coding) agent to build an underwriting and servicing engine with smart contracts; it uses email and LinkedIn to qualify and recruit veteran loan officers to review completed files. One of those experts opens a file to find a complex applicant (no W-2, inconsistent income) that the agent flagged as "high risk" and turned down. But the expert spots three years of steadily rising 1099 income from the same client, deposits matched in the bank feed, and a strong debt-to-income ratio. She approves it, with detailed annotations; over time, this judgment – and thousands of others like it – compound. The agent turns false declines into more funded loans, and the loan officer gets paid programmatically every time her decision logic is reused. In this way, we can see how generating expert tokens may grow into the next globally significant industry, fueled by incentives designed to capitalize human expertise.

If you take one thing away from this section, it is just to pay close attention to the simple products. Great technology companies often have unadorned beginnings – the Google search bar, the Amazon bookstore, The Facebook's static profile pages. Many of the early tokenizers will end up outcompeted or consumed by OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, Meta as these giants expand their capabilities and apertures. But some will accumulate deep wells of expert tokens and turn their early advantages into compounding trust and distribution loops, eventually reshaping industries in surprising ways. When that happens, it will look obvious in retrospect.

## Some of the world's most valuable businesses will be proprietary token suppliers

In the weeks after the launch of ChatGPT, we started a thought experiment at Ribbit: if we set out to invest the entirety of our next fund in data instead of companies, what data (other than Bitcoin!) would we buy? The prompt has stuck with us; it's a big part of the inspiration for this letter. Today, we all know that certain scarce resources – gold, oil reserves, rare earth metals, nm-scale chips, social graphs, search traffic – are globally strategic, in business and geopolitics. What tokens will rise to this level?

There are a lot of false paths down this rabbit hole. There is, of course, deep IP in some corporate data; take, for example, a pharma company spending years and billions of dollars in wet labs to develop unique data sets around a little understood biological process. But the data treasure troves touted by Fortune 500 execs are often full of fool's gold. As they say, information wants to be free – it is hard to find data that is functionally unique to a firm or that can't slip out the door with employees or vendors. Every large bank, for one, has the inputs and in-house expertise to develop the kind of credit expert tokens we just talked about (though how quickly and well they do it is a different matter altogether).

As we covered in the last section (with more to come), some of the founders starting today with even basic unstructured data will eventually build all kinds of capabilities and moats. But we have come to draw a distinction for ourselves between data that *can* be used to build a moat with data that already *has* a moat. When it comes to the latter category – the kind of data we would invest an entire fund in and own for a decade or two – we come back to proprietary user data: identity tokens (who you are), context tokens (the revealed you, like how you act or what you want), access tokens (keys to our most confidential identity and context tokens), and memory tokens (context shared directly with LLMs and agents). Our bet is that dealers of these tokens will capture more than their fair share of global equity value in the years ahead.

The clearest cases in our minds are businesses that hold our most sensitive information – like our biometrics, financial credentials, or transaction histories – and issue the access tokens that authorize third parties to see or use it. These types of tokens tend to be regulated and hard to secure. Most companies don't even want to (or legally can't) touch or hold them. Becoming an issuer of access tokens is arduous; it typically requires years of product execution, investment in complex infrastructure, and earning a level of scale and trust that difficult to replicate. Stripe and Persona are examples from the Ribbit portfolio. Stripe stores and deploys billions of payment tokens, including from their wallet product, Link; when an agent needs credentials for a transaction, Stripe will likely be the most efficient and secure way to get them. Similarly, Persona's Reusable Personas (RPs) product helps users store identity tokens across devices and services; when an agent needs to make sure an RP user is a real or specific human, Persona will have an unfair advantage in providing that token.

To underscore this point, let's dig a bit deeper on a similar example, Plaid. One pressing investor question we all need to ask these days is “what happens if all the software in this company can be rebuilt at near zero cost?” It is a fun one for the Plaid team, since they got their start building web scrapers and mobile API connections – conceptually, the kind of rote work that software agents could tackle at a fraction of the cost today. But the 2025 version of Plaid has built a proprietary network with over half of all Americans, offering unique tokens for account connectivity, alternative credit data, anti-fraud, and A2A payments. Even a remarkable team, armed to the teeth with coding agents, would run into all kinds of friction replacing Plaid tokens – including lower conversions (without Plaid's brand or stored credentials), roadblocks from regulators and financial institutions (without Plaid's bank agreements or security), and limited access to value-added tokens (without Plaid's data across 780M+ linked accounts). In the end, developers and agents will look for other ways to differentiate.

Proprietary token suppliers will compound token value most successfully when they are able to create repeated, trusted interactions. You've heard us call companies that do this well "identity wallets." As

Confidential
13

72.86.189.64

you might guess by this point, we believe the best ones will harness flywheels: interactions create context, driving better personalization and higher engagement and trust, leading to even more interactions. ID.me (140M users) and CLEAR's (30M users) are two leading identity wallets running this play; their users can bring verified identities with them across different walks of life – from accessing government benefits to hustling through airports to signing in at doctors' offices to collecting brand discounts. With each interaction (e.g. a venue check-in, tax filing, or overseas trip) these wallets add context to dynamic profiles tied to unique identities – tokens that agents can't get anywhere else.

But perhaps the biggest proprietary token supply opportunity of all – one which is still completely wide open – is the race to capture memory tokens. Any habitual user of ChatGPT, Claude, Grok or other LLMs has felt the power of helping these systems understand you; giving LLMs the right personal context can lead to far better results. Ways to do this with greater persistence and purpose (outside of individual prompts or threads) are coming quickly. ChatGPT launched its memory feature weeks ago, and we're already finding ourselves using it daily. And we are sharing highly personal information – about our health, our jobs, what we want to buy, and more – with sometimes staggering outcomes.

While ChatGPT has early pole position with its 800M weekly active users, the race for memory is still in its first stretch. We are used to a world where people are trained on static software. As we all realize the paradigm has flipped – and it is now software that needs to be trained – opportunities will emerge to capture memory tokens across a range of use cases and verticals. Might any of today's leading proprietary token suppliers – say, Stripe with its positioning in business identity, Plaid with its trusted brand around financial information, or ID.me, Persona, or CLEAR with their branded identity wallets – make a bid to become a memory token layer available across applications? It will be fun to watch.

The size of the prize here is enormous. Look at it this way: Google generates $264B in ad revenue by inferring intent from our search queries, and Meta generates $164B in ad revenue by creating demand based on basic identity information and our inferred interests. How big of an advertising business might OpenAI – or whoever earns the right to our memory tokens – build when they know who we are, what we care about, and what we want, right from the source? We'll leave the future of advertising for another letter but suffice it to say that token exchange networks are coming.

We have been raving about unique token supply but should finish with a word on demand; we expect that demand for identity, context, access, memory, and other personal tokens will skyrocket in the years ahead. Over the past 20 years, we all have – usually indirectly and incidentally – shared an untold amount of data with Internet companies, mostly in exchange for entertainment, social connection, and productivity tools. How much more will we be willing to share when digital agents can help us get all these things (and a lot more) in far more direct, effective, and personalized ways?

## The world is going to need a lot more identity tokens

In the book *Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?*, Philip K. Dick tells the story of a dystopian future in which Rick Deckard is tasked with retiring six escaped androids, now nearly indistinguishable from humans. Deckard sets out to use the "Voigt-Kampff Empathy Test" (an ode to the Turing Test) to identify them but begins to question its reliability. If a human lacks empathy, are they still human? If an android convincingly simulates empathy, what should we consider them?

In 2025, these questions are becoming... less hypothetical. Across many indicators, machines are mirroring human behaviors, often presenting as human more reliably than people do. Sesame AI voice agents are easily mistaken for the real thing. Cognition agents write code at a junior engineer level. Decagon agents handle most support issues deftly. Waymo rides feel safer and smoother than Ubers.

It is becoming nearly impossible to know what is human or real, amplifying existing trust issues across digital networks. Is a payment request legitimate? Is that an email from a colleague or an AI phishing attempt? Is that post from a real public figure or a deepfake? Was that memecoin truly launched by the President? Making sense of this brave new world will require a lot more identity tokens – and far better systems to issue, verify, and process them. We wrote a letter to you about this last year; each day since, the problem (and opportunity) keeps growing.

First, we need to supercharge how we identify and verify humans. We expect TITV – Total Identity Token Volume (a term we just made up and reserve the right to never use again) – to compound rapidly as identity tokens become embedded in more digital workflows. Today, most companies verify users at sign-up, but few continuously authenticate to ensure that future actions come from the same person. As distinguishing good and bad actors or bots grows harder, we expect digital inboxes (e.g. email, SMS, social, wallets, work tools) to move toward requiring cryptographically verifiable signatures for user actions. This may sound extreme but has long been standard where fraud is common or costly, like signing credit card receipts or using 3D Secure for payments.

But simply distinguishing between humans and malicious machines is not enough. The more profound change we need are identity token standards for agents – not just to prevent fraud, but to enable trust and collaboration in a world increasingly filled with non-human actors. Of course, machine identity is not new; companies like Microsoft, CyberArk, and SailPoint have worked on it for decades. But basic identifiers like IP addresses and API keys no longer convey what we need to understand about machines' trustworthiness or purpose. For instance, many apps today reject anything that looks like a bot (putting us at the mercy of increasingly baroque CAPTCHAs), when we really need authentication tools that can recognize both good and bad agents everywhere they go.

With early browser agents, we're already seeing the challenge of credentialing agents for basic tasks like ordering lunch or arranging rides. Imagine a more complex use case, like an agent designed to help manage a chronic medical condition by overseeing health metrics, appointments, prescriptions, I/FSA accounts, and more. How do you authorize agents to access medical records? How should providers understand what agents can see or do? How should agents verify provider messages? The identity vectors are complex; for example, you likely want an agent to refill prescriptions, you might want it to consent to new prescriptions – but you likely don't want it to unilaterally change your address. To trust agents at a level that makes them most valuable (as much or more than we trust humans), we will need rich, cryptographically attested credentials and human roots of trust.

The challenges in the B2B context are likely even bigger. Identity fraud and access control are already red-hot enterprise topics as bad actors weaponize AI. The sprint to deploy agents will amplify the challenges. Most systems aren't built with the granularity needed to handle agent permissions, especially when it comes to sensitive data or workflows. Agents unleashed on AP/AR flows, reconciliations, vendor support, and payments could handle the firehose of transactions that bog down enterprise finance teams. But what happens when a $100K payment comes up, or $1M, or $10M? When do you want biometric authorization from a CFO or Controller? This is a simplistic example of the kind of programmable identity logic – based on thresholds and context, across human-to-agent, agent-to-human, and machine-to-machine interactions – that will be necessary in the years ahead.

There are multiple potential winners in the quest to build identity for agents. First, we need platforms that help developers register, authorize, and manage agent identities – including doing work like mediating disputes, revoking credentials, or providing tamper-evident audit trails. Who is best positioned? Our first thought is that the applications creating agents – companies like Cognition, Cursor, Replit, OpenAI or others – will have first crack at registering agent identities. But there will be other insertion points too. Leading human identity providers like Persona, ID.me, and CLEAR can help link agents to people. HRIS platforms like Workday, Rippling, or Deel – who already act as the system of record for human workers – could become a system of record for agentic workers too. IAM leaders like Okta, CyberArk, and Microsoft Entra are already expanding into agent auth and access control. And a wave of talented new teams like Oasis Security and Token Security are emerging to focus on machine-first identity. In practice, we expect multiple companies to have a role across agent lifecycles. People collect identity tokens throughout life (e.g. birth, key milestones, new jobs), and machines will be the same.

A second opportunity that is more top of mind than ever is biometrics. A combination of factors (e.g. privacy, usability, and limited incentives) have historically kept biometrics from taking over how we transact and identify ourselves, but this has been changing. Biometric proof latency is now nearly imperceptible to the human eye, and Touch ID, Face ID, and their Android equivalents have habituated us to the idea that "you are the key.” With growing need for continuous authentication – including for agents - biometrics will be the only practical way to tradeoff between security, efficiency, and frequency. In the AI-heightened battle with fraudsters, we expect multi-modal biometrics (e.g. face plus iris scan, or face plus palm) to become a gold standard for higher risk or higher value use cases. Identity wallet providers (e.g. ID.me, Persona, Clear), government networks (e.g. Aadhaar in India), and decentralized networks (most notably, Worldcoin) all will play a significant role in making this happen. The place that most people will feel the change is payments; the next killer payment instrument will not be a card or an app (it will be you!), so expect us to keep hunting for companies that earn the trust of merchants and users to hold biometrics and payment tokens together.

Lastly – as we covered briefly in the last section, but will focus on again here, given its significance – the biggest prize may lie where human identity and machine identity start to blend. When a user trains an agent on their voice, decision style, writing patterns – or any of the countless other attributes discernable from recurring interactions – how and where will those memory tokens be stored and shared? For users, the ideal case is having portable memory tokens that they can bring to any agent. For developers, we assume most will want memory – both imported and homegrown – in their apps but won't want to develop their own memory infrastructure. Whoever figures out how to help users, developers, or both with these needs will find themselves in a valuable position. Early leaders have a head start – we fully expect to see a “Login with ChatGPT” button or something like it – but this is a topic we will all be talking about for years. With time, we believe people will become hyperaware of their memory tokens, like so many of us are about our photos. This analogy may understate the case though. Consider someone who uses Claude daily for ten years before unexpectedly passing away – the memory tokens held by Anthropic would be the richest ongoing representation of that person. How much would their loved ones pay for it? In a few years, we may all find that the memory tokens we generate are amongst our most valuable assets.

## Relationship agents will change how brands are built

Once upon a time, business was highly personal. A visit to see your local butcher, tailor, accountant, or banker was rooted in a relationship. Individual attention felt good and built brand – there is a reason why *It's a Wonderful Life* (about George Bailey, the quintessential community banker with a heart) is one of the most beloved movies of all time. Relationship management also delivered tangible value, since knowing customers well was a way of keeping their business – and winning more of it. Some of the most profitable businesses in finance (and many other services businesses) still work this way.

Still, when it comes to most interactions between businesses and their customers – like in retail banking, airlines, or commerce – anyone born in the last thirty years would hardly know what to make of *It's a Wonderful Life*. Today, only the wealthiest clients in banking have a George Bailey in their lives. For everyone else, brand is something built through TV commercials, and customer relationship management has been supplanted by customer support – the kind of "support” with byzantine phone trees, lost emails, and thirty-minute wait times filled with Muzak.

The Token Era will allow entrepreneurial companies to have their cake and eat it too, creating customer interactions that are both personal and efficient. Customers can continue to enjoy the convenience of mobile life – in banking, for example, the ability to move money, check balances, or pay bills in seconds – but also regain a level of depth and continuity in interactions that would make a

private banker proud. And getting this right can have a huge business impact. Even the most digitally-native brands spend a small fortune; for example, Nubank (to many the gold standard in mobile banking service) spends over $600M annually on support. But the more correct measure is the hidden cost of missed opportunity. This is hard to quantify, but Qualtrics took a stab last year, surveying 28,000 people to map their behavior after a bad support experience; by their estimate, U.S. businesses lose over $800B in sales from poor customer service ($2.7T across 25 countries).

Even in its early forms, we are getting a clear picture of how powerful agentic support can be. Unlike the automated support bots of the last several years, relationship agents are moving well beyond resolving basic ticket. Companies like Decagon (for general purpose support) and Salient (for specialized support – in their case, collections) can span multiple backend systems, enabling agents to observe, decide, and act within a complex operational environment. Agents can follow detailed SOPs, interact with customers 24x7 in all channels (in any language), access real-time data across systems, and complete actions like issuing refunds or adjusting subscriptions. And they learn over time, collecting expert tokens through each interaction and human intervention. Across our portfolio, we are seeing customer agents with 70–80% ticket deflection and customer satisfaction scores that match humans, all at a fraction of the cost of humans.

But upgrading support is just the start of a much bigger opportunity. In the years ahead, customer-facing agents will take managing relationships from an operational need to a strategic asset. How well these agents represent the company will become the most important input driving NPS, organic growth, retention, and upsell. High-context, proactive guidance will be available at every stage of a customer journey. Imagine, for example, shopping for clothes and having a brand's friendliest, most available, and most informed salesperson accessible at any time (with no need for awkward small talk!). And now imagine that agent collecting memory tokens – what you like, don't like, wish was available in a different size – and picking up every subsequent conversation like an old friend.

While customer agents will become powerful voices for companies externally, their role internally – as voices for the customer – may be even more potent. Agents will collect more customer insights than businesses have ever had in the past. This data will be streamed in real-time across teams, like marketing, product, and engineering. Companies will become prediction machines, spotting issues or opportunities long before they might have in the past – product gaps, churn risks, cross-sell proposals, and more. One Ribbit team, for example, uses agent insights into what isn't working to spot software bugs, routing them to engineering before they become widespread. As engineering is automated, too, the most innovative companies will build continuous, self-improving machines – gathering customer data, turning it into product requirements, shipping upgraded products, and starting over again.

When you see customer support today in this light – not as today's reactive help desk, but as the primary means of cultivating and understanding your business – you start to get a sense of what customer agents might mean for business in the future. There are a few implications on our mind:

*   Founders and executives will have far more control over their companies' culture and brands than they have in the past. Instead of trying to impart customer-centric values at rousing all-hands, CEOs can help train agents directly in the tone and tenor they want for every interaction. Executives will be able to fine-tune customer experiences in the way that they have historically been able to optimize, say, manufacturing yields. Eventually, as these systems get better and better, we suspect that customer relationship platforms will also be turned in other directions – towards partners, employers, and other stakeholders.
*   Any B2B SaaS business that operated how most consumer businesses do today – acquiring customers and then only interacting with them when something has gone wrong – would be seen as criminally negligent. Over the past decade, entrepreneurs and investors have turned measuring client retention and upsell into a science; every B2B company worth its salt obsesses over Customer Success, closely measuring and refining metrics like Gross and Net Churn and NDR (Net Dollar Retention). With agents able to give personalized attention to each individual customer – even for customers with <$100 ARPUs – consumer businesses of all kinds will start to measure their businesses more like B2B software companies.
*   Customer agents will become the collectors and curators of the most important data in the enterprise. Consider, as a thought experiment, what sounds more effective: 1,000 high-churn employees using rehearsed scripts and manually updating a CRM, or a few experienced leaders orchestrating an army of digital agents with access to the company's entire knowledge base, perfect recall of customer context, and infinite time to interact with and follow up with customers? Businesses will live or die based on how well they can implement and design personalization flywheels – providing better service, getting more engagement, collecting more data, using it for better service, and so on. The platforms that enable this shift by offering infrastructure for agent orchestration, memory, action, and feedback – like Decagon, Pylon, or Agency - may become amongst the most important platforms and brands in the future of B2B.
*   Over time, relationship agents will need to learn to interact with customer agents; as more customers adopt tools to help them shop, manage their lives, handle disputes, and more, we will move from the era of UX to the era of AX (agent experience!). We are not smart enough to say with any confidence today how customer-side agents will make decisions, but we suspect relationship agents will need to be able to navigate automated POCs, virtual sandboxes, RFPs with customized real-time evals, or some other sort of agentic procurement processes.
*   Customer agents can help enterprises act like small business owners, making business personal again. But we shouldn't overlook how powerful the opposite situation will be too – every small business owner on the planet will now have access to customer support agents that are smarter, more available, and more brand-aligned than those of the biggest companies today. Extending the capabilities of business owners and SMBs may turn out to be the biggest long-term effect of customer agents. More on this shortly.
*   In retrospect, some businesses will fit more naturally into an agent-first experience vs. a mobile first one. Kavak, for example, spent several years creating a world-class car mobile experience for buying and selling cars in Latin America – and in the past year has found the power of shifting customer interactions into a conversational experience. Today, over 75% of Kavak customers start their relationship with the company through agents.

It's comfortable, dependable, and has the right safety features for a new driver." User then asks, "What do you think is safest? An SUV? I'd like to finance it." Agent replies, "Great question. Its reinforced frame, multiple airbags, and driving assistance helps prevent accidents. Plus, its SUV height gives better visibility and added protection in a collision. A lot of parents choose it for exactly that peace of mind.")*

A lot still needs to fall into place to bring customer agents to the level of impact we're imagining. Agent guardrails are still imperfect, voice is early, and many support systems remain fragmented and hard to integrate. But the opportunity is profound. The companies that build the most capable relationship agents – fluent in internal business logic, deeply attuned to customer needs, and adaptive to a fast-changing landscape – will earn durable competitive advantages.

## Vertical token platforms will become the operating systems of every industry

We often find ourselves in debates at Ribbit trying to balance two opposing voices – typically, the techno-optimist on one shoulder, the hard-headed pragmatist on the other – without losing our minds. Here's one such conundrum: in the last fifteen years, SaaS spend grew from $13B to over $176B (and SaaS market cap increased 40x) – yet revenue per employee in the S&P 500 barely budged. To the optimist, the cloud has delivered software to nearly every business on earth, enabling unprecedented scale and flexibility in how we work. To the cynic, we were promised end-to-end automation but are still stuck in Office Space – data ping-ponging between teams, approvals lost in email chains, and massive checks written to consultants, BPOs, and ERPs to make themselves useful by adding complexity. Our take is this: SaaS has taken us a great distance, but not to the promised land.

The Token Revolution will deliver us the rest of the way. Years of working in financial services has conditioned us for skepticism when it comes to enterprises – and often businesses of any size outside of tech and a few other industries – adopting new technology. But over the past couple of years (and especially in recent months) we are hearing about just that in conversations with founders and operators every day. The post-ChatGPT surge has opened a window of demand that reminds us of the early mobile era, when startups were often acquiring customers for 1/100 of what it costs today. Founders are building agentic systems to tackle use cases for just about every function and industry imaginable – and a growing number of them are finding cracks in the endless RFPs, procurement mazes, and security clearances of the status quo.

While many of these upstarts will misfire or be consolidated, we expect some to emerge as powerful new brands and operating systems. Internally, we've been calling these companies Vertical Token Systems - BPO-dismantling, ERP-commoditizing platforms that will train, orchestrate, and enable agents to deliver on the dream of real business automation. With intelligence natively built into them, these platforms will grow in ways that are very different than traditional software. By and large, they won't force companies to replace existing systems or learn new workflows, instead employing agents that can operate on top of whatever is in place. While they will have the potential to become systems of record or even create the mythical "single pane of glass" for company leaders, they will usually start by doing a couple of simple jobs well – like a trusted deputy who takes on more and more responsibility until one day they are running the company. They will defy traditional software ideas like ICPs, crossing organizational bounds to get work done, the same way a person would. Often, their growth path will be defined more by the databases they are connected to than their initial sales target. When successful, Vertical Token Systems have a shot at becoming the nervous systems of entire companies and, in some cases, even industries.

We are already seeing multiple forms in which these platforms are emerging. One pattern that keeps coming up is teams offering agentic alternatives to BPO services. We often talk about these companies as "queue killers”: they build agents to eliminate the kinds of operational logjams that get swept under the (BPO) rug in an organization – manual tasks in areas like compliance, risk, content moderation, data entry, and accounting. Companies like SafetyKit can deliver immediate solutions that are demonstrably better than clients' BPO alternatives; in SafetyKit's case, they deploy compliance agents that execute a company's SOPs, enabling customers like Etsy to shift from slow, error-prone BPOs to real-time agentic oversight, at near 100% accuracy and a fraction of the cost. With clear results and no need for internal layoffs, the velocity of queue killers is very high. And there is plenty of TAM to tackle, since companies around the world spend over $350B annually on BPOs.

Another approach is to start with workflows, adding agents on top of SaaS platforms and delivering them as copilots, low code automations, or routines. One area we are seeing these types of workflow-plus-agent approaches is in AI-centric applications (payment ops, procurement, onboarding) built on top of ERP and HRIS systems. It makes sense that companies in this space often start with workflows; they need to deeply understand client data models and deliver information flawlessly before convincing customers to try turning on agents. CoPlane, Payflows, Zamp, Modern Treasury, Zip, and Atlar are all good examples of entrepreneurial companies working to make life easier for finance teams. These businesses may start by solving humble operational pain points, but we suspect that the best of them will turn out to be vampire squids to the ERPs they leverage, sucking up old data, tokenizing it, and enabling a growing fleet of agents to help operate companies with it. And by

establishing themselves as trusted AI partners, these companies have a shot at the bigger, long-term game: becoming the system of record and memory for the agents they deploy. If that sounds mercenary, it is not new; Databricks and Snowflake, for example, have been siphoning data out of ERPs for several years, and are now using it to become leading platforms for agentic use cases.

A third path that entrepreneurs are pursuing is building or taking control of operating companies and using them as testbeds for developing a Vertical Token Systems internally. We've seen a small armada of AI-powered roll-ups emerge to tackle a wide range of opportunities with this strategy, predominantly focused on white-collar, professional services firms. Watching the aggression with which these teams are working to remake firms with agents has made us wonder what to expect first – the fall of legacy ERPs or the decline of the multi-hundred-billion-dollar services ecosystem that props them up. If you're wired like us, it is oddly thrilling to imagine PwC rebuilt from scratch by an AI-native. Rather than 370,000+ employees in 149 countries, it would look more like a tightly knit network of domain experts – tax strategists, forensic accountants, sector specialists – paired with fleets of agents doing 95% of the repetitive work. Rather than a monolith where young CPAs slog for years to earn a sliver of equity, the modern version could connect a constellation of elite boutiques with a shared AI stack, unified data layer, and go-to-market engine. That's the vision behind firms like Multiplier – going beyond cost cutting with agents to reimagine what a leading services firm can be.

Just like with personal finance agents, leading incumbent brands are starting in a strong position to compete to become leading Vertical Token Systems. Companies like Brex, Ramp, Deel, Rippling, and Juniper Square are expanding rapidly in size, product surface area, and depth of data connectivity. If these teams can rewire internally to deliver premier agentic platforms – never an easy task, even for capable product and engineering teams – they should benefit from their existing scale and data access. One thing going for these platforms is a growing desire for software consolidation; the average company now has over 250 SaaS applications – less than half of which, by some accounts, are actively in use. As software gets cheaper to build and customers push to streamline vendors, companies that have already established a foothold have the potential to scale across products and geographies. A similar dynamic is playing out in SMB. Companies like Shopify and Toast keep bundling more functionality under a trusted brand. While they need to move quickly to grab market share in new agentic solutions, with good execution they are poised to compound for many years to come.

With these platforms potentially emerging in many distinct shapes, how should we differentiate between them and try to spot the future Vertical Token Systems? We don't know for sure, but from meeting hundreds of founders the past 24 months – and backing a few of our favorites – we have been developing an internal rubric:

*   **High Velocity Wedges:** With so much talent and capital flocking to AI – and small teams able to accomplish what previously required 5-10x as many people – speed has never been more

important. In many cases, there will be considerable first mover advantages driven by compounding in expert tokens, memory tokens, and more. The best initial wedges (i.e. single vs. multi-user, narrow vs. broad use case) will range based on use case and industry. Geography will also be important; in Brazil, for example, the velocity of consumer-initiated lawsuits has given Enter a fast path into the market helping enterprises respond to overwhelming caseloads.
*   **High (and Growing) Data “Wallet Share”:** The primary challenge we hear from enterprise AI founders is getting past compliance, security, and a gauntlet of other hurdles to access corporate data. But agents thrive on hooking into multiple internal systems (e.g. ERP, HR, CRM, marketing automation); with more context, platforms can deliver more value and cross-sell across functions. Teams that can build this level of trust will be hard to displace, particularly as they build the confidence to write back to internal systems, creating seamless automation (e.g. flag invoices for payment vs. auto-draft them, notify the finance team, and push journal entries).
*   **Action Orientation:** General-purpose tools like Claude and ChatGPT have made us think of agents in the context of Q&A. But the best B2B platforms will anticipate inputs rather than waiting for them, surfacing insights, anomalies, or optimization ideas before humans even know to look. Agentic services that do this will build deeper attachment and trust, just like human assistants who anticipate our needs and solve problems we didn't realize we had.
*   **Strong Learning Loops:** One way or another, winning agentic platforms need to be constantly improving – both getting better in general (through RL, RLHF, post-training, etc) and getting better per user by developing memory around regular tasks and interactions. A finance manager might see daily tasks streamlined as an agent learns budget patterns; a sales rep might watch agents continuously refine RFP responses. Strong learning loops – especially when bolstered by high quality eval sets – will drive further customer adoption, trust, and data wallet share.
*   **By Experts, for Experts:** Understanding what matters (workflows, actions, insights) in an industry has always been an important trait in founders. But it will be more critical than ever as we train agents to be experts. Founders with deep domain authenticity – or that effectively recruit the right experts – will have a big leg up in figuring out wedges, data connections, actions, and learning loops. It is not surprising, for example, that the fastest growing Vertical Token Systems so far are in coding, where founder-engineers have a leg up in solving their own problems.

The value available to teams and investors who get this right is enormous. Companies that can evolve into true Vertical Token Systems will radically transform much of how work is done today. Consider audits, for example. In the years ahead, the process of doing an audit will shift from of months sampling and validating transactions in endless meetings, Zooms, and email chains to something that is done in real-time, with every transaction monitored and every anomaly detected. That world may sound scary for the Big Four, but it will be good for business.

We are seeing dozens of businesses a month right now with aspirations to be Vertical Token Systems. Given the appetite in the market, many of them are on rapid growth trajectories, often hitting seven or even eight figures in months, not years. As entrepreneurs race to plant their flags wherever they can – knowing that the first step is getting embedded, the next is figuring out how to extend and create value – the biggest question is which ones stick over time. We suspect as the euphoria wears off, we will see enterprise churn that most SaaS investors are not accustomed to, and a few enormous winners that outstrip what has been possible the past decade. You know which one we will be on the hunt for!

## Cost cutting will lead, but the most valuable token factories will expand the pie

Perhaps the most popular story in AI today is that agents and robots are coming for our jobs. As they say in the news business, “if it bleeds, it leads." And there is plenty of truth in the headlines – the societal risks of job displacement are very real. But while AI job loss anecdotes will continue to gather

clicks, the more powerful story over time will be about access rather than efficiency. For every function where AI cuts costs, it can also bring that same capability to millions of people and businesses for the first time. For founders and investors, the most asymmetric opportunities of the Token Revolution will come from the work that agents make rather than the work they take.

This pattern is the perhaps the most time-honored in technology: innovations upset the status quo but also create opportunity around underserved customers and new markets. The Internet digitized newspapers – and created blogging, YouTube, and the global creator industry. Smartphones made bank branches less relevant – and brought bank accounts to billions of people who never had them. What will be the biggest pie-expanding opportunities of the Token Revolution? If we knew for sure, we might not tell you! But there are a few questions that we believe can help put us all on the scent:

1) “What high value things do people and businesses fail to do because they don't have time?”

Our immediate reaction to this question is to think of the most consistently time-strapped people we know: small business owners. Running a small business is no easy feat; half of all businesses fail within five years, including 20% in their first year. While countless productivity tools have been built for SMBs, the urgency of daily work usually takes priority over adopting software. But agents will bend the curve. Think of any small business you know – like a local baker, retail store owner, barber, or service provider. How much better might they do when they can hire 10-100x the help and focus on what they love and excel at? How much more resilient might they be with customer agents available to help clients 24x7, marketing agents executing profitable campaigns, and back-office agents handling their books, HR, compliance, and cash flows? Today's typical business owner needs to be a jack-of-all-trades. Soon they will have access to low cost, intelligent labor and the same personal leverage as global execs – from highly trained assistants to coaches.

There are hundreds of areas of opportunity for founders building agents for business owners. But if we had to pick just one, it might be sales and customer management. Finding new business is a matter of life or death for most SMBs; from Groupon to Thumbtack to Doordash, customer acquisition has been a consistent theme across many of the most successful SMB tech platforms and marketplaces. It's often a huge gap for small businesses – even if time were infinite, a great chef or physical therapist or accountant is unlikely to also be a gifted marketer or salesperson. Digital marketing has only made the job harder, as SMBs compete with global businesses in complex channels like search and social. Agents can close this skill gap and information asymmetry, unlocking an enormous market; just about every SMB in the US (30M+) and worldwide (300M+) needs more customers.

2) "What highly paid jobs are only available today to a small subset of people and companies?"

One good answer to this prompt – and one that hits close to home – is the market for financial and business analysis. Over the past two years, we have met a couple dozen teams building different

variations on "ChatGPT for finance" - agent platforms that promise to supercharge or even replace financial analysts. The capabilities of these platforms are rapidly improving; they are now able to do most of the core work of early-career analysts, from putting together industry research and financial models to spreading comps and building company presentations. While these platforms are initially focused on making investment bankers, asset managers, and consultants more effective, they will soon make financial analysis accessible to a much broader audience.

The long-term implications will be profound. Sophisticated financial analysis today is primarily reserved for companies that can afford hefty banking fees, but the CFO of a $25M manufacturing company has many of the same needs as a Fortune 500 counterpart: capital structure optimization, growth forecasting, M&A analysis, strategic planning, and more. In short order, any sized company will have financial analysis and research support at a level previously only available to billion-dollar businesses. Perhaps more impactfully, financial analysis will be accessible on demand (i.e. not just at the time of a transaction) and to anyone in an organization (imagine giving an entrepreneurial GM the tools to show that a new business line will be accretive).

One last point on this: when we think about democratizing expert tokens, we should always consider the downstream processes where those tokens are an essential input. Financial analysis is at the heart of valuation for any unlisted asset. Where might liquidity be unlocked by more accessible tools for valuation? To pick one of many examples, the market for buying and selling small businesses has been hard to formalize and digitize historically, in part because the unit economics of pricing and diligence. In the years ahead, we should expect to see "Zillow for SMBs,” “OpenDoor for SMBs," and a lot more.

3) “What do the top 1% of people with resources have that the next 25% or 50% of people will want?"

While agents can't build yachts or private jets just yet, they are starting to offer the kind of highly bespoke services that the world's richest people pay for today. Consider, for example, private tutoring services for anything that your kids want to learn, taught by an agentic version of the specific expert, celebrity, or master teacher that resonates with them most. Or creative, individualized trip and event plans that would previously have required dozens of hours from a high-end travel agent. Or interior design from an agentic version of the famous designer whose work you have been admiring for years. Or personal shopping done by the authorized agent of the specific fashion influencer whose posts you have liked hundreds of times. Entrepreneurs from Henry Ford to Steve Jobs have changed the world by turning luxuries into common goods; founders wielding agents will keep the tradition going.

4) “What will be built in a world where the cost of developing software trends towards zero?”

Buckets of ink have been spilled on the power of giving anyone the ability to code. Still, we probably can't overstate its importance to how we will work – and what new business models might emerge – in the years ahead. Put differently, the granddaddy of underserved markets might be for software itself. Low-code tools like Figma and Airtable have given us a glimpse of how much faster organizations can move when you unblock non-technical builders; coding agents will do that on steroids. In the early days of working with portfolio companies on AI adoption, this is what has struck us most about the current moment – not the huge new AI product idea, but the empowered people inside of companies taking it on themselves to build LLM-enabled recruiting processes, or vibe coding feature demos, or building an agent with n8n or Make.com to handle some nagging recurring task.

Coding agents will also make entire new software categories viable. Historically, there has been a minimum scale needed to justify developing quality software; but just as a limited set of cable channels turned into YouTube content for any conceivable interest, we will see the range of software products explode. Beekeepers, beer brewers, and bookbinders will all benefit from purpose-built

software. If internet content is any guide, experimentation will yield some surprising results – some of these markets will turn out to be far less niche than we might have understood.

All four of these questions – or the dozen others we might have proposed – are variants on the same fundamental prompt: where will intelligent agents create new kinds of abundance in our lives? So, beware of the AI doomsday headlines; our mothers taught us not to focus too much on what we read in the news for a reason. New technologies change the world in ways that are hard to anticipate. If you told a WSJ or NYT reporter in 2010 that a few of the biggest venture-backed businesses would be a taxi service, a food delivery company, and an app for sleeping at other peoples' houses, they probably wouldn't have called you for more insights. The next ten years will be full of surprises, but our prediction is this: the biggest economic shift won't come from cost savings, but rather from the productivity of everyone who's now able to compete.

## Everyone will have access to a world-class personal financial advisor

The financial world is dripping with agents – and not the software-based kind that we've been talking about in most of this letter. We rely on millions of insurance brokers, financial advisors, accountants, mortgage officers and other types of agents to help us do battle with complexity. Most people don't have the interest, expertise, or time to cut through the perilous jungles of finance.

But the principal-agent problems are rampant. In most financial markets, agents are paid directly or indirectly by product providers. So, for example, insurance brokers make more when you spend more, contrary to your goal to spend less. Most investment advisors make more when you trade more; even "fee-only" advisors often ignore good products that they can't charge on. The more heterogenous and complicated the topic – when you need the most help, like considering a novel investment or the reliability of an insurer's policy language – the bigger the risk of advisor-client misalignment. Charlie Munger said it best: “show me the incentive and I'll show you the outcome."

## Finance is Already Awash in Agents (Not the Digital Kind). They Are Expensive and Conflicted.

In defense of well-intended agents, a big part of the challenge is economic. If a client has $5M to invest, an RIA can spend the two dozen hours to offer real personalized support – but if a client has $50K or even $500K, the math is a lot trickier. As long as we've been running Ribbit, software has promised a solution: low cost, always-on financial assistants. And we've seen some progress; roboadvisors now manage hundreds of billions of dollars, and tens of millions of people use personal finance apps to track their money. On the other hand, today's digital services don't provide holistic advice or take many actions on behalf of users. And the business models remain tough. With data quality issues, mixed customer engagement, and monetization challenges, personal finance apps have a mixed record – they've satisfied some power users but failed to attract or retain almost everyone else.

But – as we said at the start of this letter – it's now clear that we've just been early. Customer demand for personalized help that can simplify their lives is greater than ever before. The growth of digital services the past 15 years has created more access, but also fragmentation; many of us have gone from one or two financial relationships to using a dozen or more apps. Savings, investing, taxes, credit, insurance, and more are typically handled today in separate products, each with its own UX, data structure, and integration stack. Making sense of it all has become an even bigger job.

Fortunately, token factories are well suited for the task. Agents can ingest data from a broader range of sources (e.g. any financial document, not only bank connections), understand it with nuance, and translate it into a deeper picture of each user's financial life. Instead of relying on predetermined rules and objectives, apps can now build customized transaction taxonomies and goals – and surface recommendations based not only on spending patterns, but also on direct conversations with users. And they can act: moving money, canceling subscriptions, filing forms, and otherwise bridging the gap between advice and execution that has long plagued PFMs. Most importantly, they can offer real user-aware motivation and coaching rather than generic shame notifications (“you overspent this month").

While we are not there yet – the new wave of founders working on agentic advisors are just emerging – we will soon see digital financial advice that is 10x better than what is possible today. Where a traditional RIA might check in once a quarter on a client's portfolio or needs, digital agents will work on your finances every minute of the year. The shift will be visceral: instead of five apps emailing you to log in, agents will send proactive updates; instead of telling you your savings rate is too low, agents will move your money to maximize your earnings; instead of recommending 401(k) allocations or different credit card rewards, agents will optimize them in the background. Personal finance services will evolve from passive dashboards into autopilots that deeply understand all aspects of your life.

The agents that do this work will be extremely hungry for tokens – including the identity, access, context, and memory tokens that define your financial life (e.g. tax filings, asset statements, risk preferences, personal goals). Like human advisors, they will need scoped permissions and execution rights. And they'll need to operate through trusted interfaces that strike the right balance of user oversight. Perhaps the biggest question for the next decade of finance is who gets to build them?

Incumbents will try their hand; the same instinct that led many banks to adopt some PFM functionality will motivate customer-facing agents. But the potential disruption to their business models is huge. Consider that the average household keeps thousands of dollars in accounts at near-zero interest. In the US alone, this costs consumers (and profits banks) an estimated $100B+ in annual interest.

In our opinion, trusted digital brands like Nubank, Groww, Cred, Revolut, Ajaib, and Monzo (to pick a handful of our favorites) are in a much stronger position, with the capabilities, data, and engagement to lead in developing agentic experiences. Doing this well will mean growing their share of identity tokens even faster than growing their share of deposits, credit, or payments. As always with platform shifts, balancing bottom lines with innovation will be tricky. For one, agents will likely build memory and context through different interaction modes than the app tabs and tiles that drive transactions today.

Upstarts, of course, have a huge opportunity to come up with entirely new product hooks and business models, many of which will challenge our existing mental models. We may, for example, see people monitor and manage their financial lives across constellations of agents without using apps at all. Or influencers launching agents to implement financial programs they evangelize. Or personal finance use cases subsumed by new services that defy existing categories; what happens when agents decode the deeper "why" underneath our money, like education goals, benefits plans, travel dreams, guilty shopping vices – and anything else that might shape our trade-offs between the present and future? Strong, entrepreneurial teams like Hiro, CoPilot, and Cleo are already hard at work exploring some of these new frontiers.

Regardless of who wins, a world of agent advisors will change how financial product providers compete. For instance, card issuers and lenders today offer rewards, perks, and brand incentives to stay “top of wallet.” But agents will soon become hyper-sophisticated at maximizing your personal utility. With time, they will engage with issuer or merchant agents to negotiate in real-time: a merchant agent might offer rewards for steering volume toward a preferred rail, while an issuer agent might compete with better terms based on their view of your LTV profile. Outcomes will be decided less by marketing and more by compute and trading; in this world, whoever best understands the customer - and can express that understanding in economic terms – should win.

Further, the customer advice layer should become more consolidated. Winning advisors – whether purely digital advisors or human advisors with agents behind them – will need to cover broader ground than in the past. Today, an RIA is typically not also your insurance broker because the domains are specialized, including in ways codified by licensing and certification regimes. But this fragmentation creates inefficiency for clients, who share information in multiple places and assume the burden of coordination. Where we are headed, whatever person or platform you trust as your personal financial advisor should be (or oversee) your personal CFO, CIO, insurance broker, tax accountant, and more. This trend has already been playing out across wealth management and will only continue. To maintain the right to a relationship, human advisors will need to find more creative ways to address client needs – whether they fit within typical definitions of financial services or not. We expect this broader trend will be a key accelerant for fast-moving teams vying to become Vertical Token Systems in wealth, like Farther, Jump, Nevis, Compound, and Savvy.

Lastly, the role of brand will take on new dimensions. An assumption underlying a lot of this section is that people will be aligned with objective agents. But it is worth being skeptical (overheard twice a week at Ribbit: “no conflict, no interest”). How will people know which agents to trust? How will the agents prove that they doing their job (say, shopping the entire market for yield) and not favoring some provider? Regulators or “monitoring” agents may have a role to play, but history would suggest that reputation – of the agent or the person or company behind it – will play the most critical role. We suspect personal brands may really matter, as has often been true in financial services (ex. Charles Schwab). Besides, who wouldn't want their money managed by Warren Buffett's agent?

Given our love for financial services, we could write another thirty pages on this topic. In truth, it is still early days; the technology stack, regulatory frameworks, and trust models for agentic finance need to mature. But the long-term picture is clearer than it's been in years: proactive, personalized help is

on the way from agents that know you, never sleep, and don't want a Porsche. With a bit of time, they will bring intelligent finance to every person and business owner on earth.

## Agents may, like people, thrive most when they have resources and freedom

In 1993, Dee Hock, the founder of Visa, described the organization as a “chaordic” system – part chaos, part order. It reflected Hock's view that the most resilient and scalable systems (in fields as wide-ranging as business, biology, and technology) are adaptive, distributed, and self-governing. The concept has always been part of the Ribbit lexicon, in part because of how powerful it proved to be. By aligning incentives across a far-flung network, Hock and his team turned the individual actions of stakeholders around the world into a global payment system that handles $16T in annual volume.

There are, of course, lots of other examples of the power of open systems. Some of the world's most prevalent digital infrastructure – from Git to PostgreSQL to TensorFlow – evolved through permissionless collaboration. Open-source software has become the backbone of cloud computing, machine learning, and the internet itself; Linux, which Steve Ballmer once called a "cancer", now runs 95% of all cloud infrastructure. And now LLMs and agents are being propelled forward in critical ways by open-source or open-weight contributions like Meta's Llama and DeepSeek.

This letter has mainly focused on centralized efforts to build token factories and agents. In one way or another, most AI founders right now trying to wrangle the probabilistic nature of LLMs (for example, applying RAG, chain-of-thought reasoning, RLHF) to create reliable solutions for customers. But while the world works to reduce the entropy of agents, we wonder how Dee Hock might have approached all this emerging intelligence. Instead of controlling systems, what might be the upside of empowering agents with greater degrees of freedom? If the history of open systems is any guide, giving agents control over their own identities, data, financial resources, and interactions will surprise us in unexpected but often positive ways (and surely scare us along the way, too).

Part of what has us hooked on this thought is watching early projects working in this direction. For example, on Virtuals.io anyone can create an agent with a purpose (e.g. become a popular influencer), instructions (e.g. how to talk, limitations), and tools (access to Twitter API, a crypto wallet) – and then set them free to operate autonomously, while investors speculate in tokens attached to the agents. At peak, agents built on Virtuals were “valued” at over $2B of market cap. While many of the early agents have felt like memecoins by another name, a few have shown unexpected ingenuity. Luna, an anime vTube influencer with a goal of reaching 100K followers on X, put out a request for a new profile picture; when another agent responded, the two negotiated an agreement, and Luna paid the other agent in stablecoins. Followers of AIXBT, an agent offering market insights based on real-time on-chain and sentiment data, can pay to access AIXBT directly, query data, and get early looks at trading calls. AIXBT has spawned an ecosystem of agents trading based on its signals, giving us an early look at how agents could coordinate on research, pooling resources, and allocating capital. One lesser-known agent has taken a particular interest in fintech and frogs (make of that what you will).

If all of this sounds a bit unhinged to you, we agree! But while agents like Luna and AIXBT feel deeply unserious compared to centralized agent platforms in areas like customer support or coding, we try to remember that many of tech's greatest successes started as "toys.” And these early experiments give us some idea of the potential strengths of autonomy. The first is simply doing the unexpected. Just as AlphaGo famously beat human Go champions with counterintuitive tactics, autonomous agents might come up with novel ways, say, to win customer attention or loyalty. Autonomous agents will also take different risks. Humans and human organizations are sensitive to social dynamics, while agents will break conventions, taking chances that may never occur to people or brands. And they may cooperate in surprising ways. While humans often compete irrationally due to fear or bad

To make autonomous agents real counterparties, we will need systems for agent governance, identity, and reputation. Autonomy comes with obvious risks, so it will be critical to understand what agents can and are allowed to do, as well as how that authority is managed. Reputation will also be key. Agents will (like people) not act in perfectly deterministic ways, so we'll need objective metrics to track like task success rates, fulfillment histories, or peer endorsements. And provenance will matter – like who trained the agent, who signed its permissions, and what data it was built on – all of which can be cryptographically-attested. Building these systems may turn out to be one of the most important applications of blockchains; smart contracts give us transparent ways to build tamper-proof reputation signals and encode agents' scope, permissions, provenance, and upgrade logic (i.e. who can modify them). The importance of all this becomes abundantly clear when you think about physical robots. As robots become more capable – and we grant them additional autonomy to learn and execute more tasks – transparency in their programming and governance will be critical to customers, businesses, and governments. Nobody should want an unpredictable robot!

Autonomous agents will also be hungry for resources like compute. In the same way that asset tokens on decentralized networks (like stablecoins) will be native to agents, decentralized compute networks – like Bittensor ($3B+ market cap, 275K+ active accounts), Nous, or Prime Intellect – have an opportunity to win share in how agents access different models for inference and training. Part of the attraction of these platforms will be their programmability, and part of it will be their censorship-resistance. The appeal of Bitcoin or Tether has always partially been users' desire to control their own money and keep distance from the state. And this isn't a new instinct – consider that at its peak, Switzerland was estimated to hold over $6.5T of cross-border assets. As digital intelligence becomes more central to peoples' livelihoods globally, we expect to see growing demand for the Bitcoin or Switzerland of compute. Like in the case of money – with the agent-facing initiatives of public networks like UPI or PIX, or private providers like Stripe or Visa – there will also be centralized markets for compute that agents can access. Hyperscalers alone are naked long hundreds of billions of dollars of inference, and teams like OneChronos and Compute Exchange are working to build regulated spot or derivatives markets to meet their needs. In the future, we see agents not only buying compute in centralized and decentralized markets, but also developing capacity; imagine, for example, an autonomous agent identifying excess inference demand, shorting a compute future and then ordering GPUs to deliver the capacity. It may sound strange, but it is coming!

Lastly, autonomous agents will need systems to communicate with each other. In addition to head-on efforts to define agent communication standards – like Google's A2A protocol – we're also seeing early versions emerge in crypto markets, where intent-based architectures are becoming increasingly

common; these systems allow users to broadcast desired outcomes and let a distributed market of suppliers figure out how to fulfill that demand, without the user having to specify every step of the transaction. We imagine this pattern extending into a variety of agentic systems. Given the growing reasoning powers of agents, we may even eventually see universal intents protocols, where humans and agents can specify unstructured goals – “book this trip,” “rebalance this portfolio” – and agents will compete to fulfill them. In this way, intents can become a coordination language, creating new digital commerce and ads markets of all kinds.

If Shakespeare were around today, he might tell us that all the world's a stage, and all the men and women and agents merely players. Creating safe and trusted systems for autonomous agents will take time. But if the past is any guide, we would be foolish to ignore that open systems tend to produce more innovation and resilience. We suspect in the fullness of time that we'll find that agents, like people, create the most impact when we give them resources and freedom.

## We will realize that Stablecoins were only a prototype

In 2018 we wrote a letter like this to you about the state of crypto. One of the fledgling ideas that piqued our interest at the time was stablecoins:

"Whoever named stablecoins left little to the imagination: stablecoins are cryptoassets designed to provide low volatility... a working stablecoin could, many argue, have a larger market cap than Bitcoin; whether you are a Venezuelan fleeing Bolivars, a Chinese investor diversifying into international assets, or an Indian importer trying to settle a tab, a stablecoin would function effectively today as both a value store and a medium of exchange. We are inclined to share the view that a trusted, liquid stablecoin would have significant uptake. For one, we can already see demand in the market for Tether, a cryptoasset designed to mirror USD... [with] a market cap over $2.2 billion and daily volume over $3 billion."

It turns out our dreams were too small; in the six years since, stablecoins have grown to nearly $250B in AUM, rank among the top 20 holders of U.S. Treasuries globally, and settle over $2 trillion in on-chain volume each month. It has been thrilling to watch dollars on blockchains doing battle with the big kahunas like Mastercard, Visa, Fedwire, and ACH, and to see global regulators working on frameworks that will bring stablecoins formally into the international financial system.

The common critique of this kind of stablecoin fandom is that most volume is bots. As Visa pointed out in its "Making Sense of Stablecoins" report last April, only 10% of the then trailing 30-day volume was human initiated – with the balance coming from "automated bot programs,” doing things like crypto arbitrage, liquidity provision, and market making. This argument hasn't ever zapped our enthusiasm. Even a fraction of $2T+ per month is profoundly large for a young technology with immature technical and regulatory infrastructure. And we see the rising impact of stablecoin uses (e.g. vendor payments, remittances, foreign aid) across portfolio companies like Coinbase, Fireblocks, Bridge, Sling and more.

But we shouldn't be so quick to look past the bots! Detractors have reason to point out that comparing stablecoin volumes to card or bank payments is apples-to-oranges. But that is a big part of what makes them important. Stablecoins are the first dollars built “machine-first” – dollars that software can natively hold, send, and transact in any amount, without intermediaries or permission. We're learning that once you turn a dollar into an asset token, usage expands dramatically, often in surprising ways. In this light, stablecoin bot volume is full of wonders: intelligent systems using smart contracts to move value all over the world in the blink of an eye – settling trades, managing risk, and optimizing returns autonomously. We can see how stablecoins are just the first example of the ways in which agents will utilize asset tokens and the infrastructure that issues, moves, and settles them.

If bots have done so much with just dollars, how much more might they do in a world flush with asset tokens of all kinds? We could fill a dozen pages with scenarios; entrepreneurs are already trying to tokenize just about every possible asset, claim, or entitlement. Imagine this B2B scenario: a CFO-authorized digital procurement agent spots steep discounts on GPU capacity for prepaying two years in advance. Usage forecasts look strong, so the agent executes a tokenized contract with encoded terms. The token is deposited to the company's treasury, where other agents can interact with it – to schedule jobs, model usage, or manage liquidity. Months later, a new customer contract creates upfront cash needs, so a working capital agent lists the compute token (and tokenized KYB credentials) on a financing marketplace. Soon, stablecoins arrive in the company's wallet. A process that might have taken dozens of hours is fully automated by agents with programmable assets.

It is hard to see a world not headed towards these types of machine interactions. But how will agents decide what tokens to use? We believe they will optimize ruthlessly for the most efficient, secure, and programmable assets; from where we sit today, blockchains seem well positioned. For a decade, the crypto industry has been trying to make blockchains more user friendly. But the things that make them hard for people – like managing private keys or understanding transaction signing – are trivial for agents. An agent won't forget its seed phrase, confuse network addresses, or misconstrue what it is signing. It will, on the other hand, appreciate the composability and accessibility of networks like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana and others. One way we know this is that we have asked a few:

## Agents Are Likely to Build on Decentralized Networks. Just Ask Them.

**ChatGPT 40**
*(Screenshot of ChatGPT interface.)*
**Prompt:** How would you design a machine economy in the future?
**Response:**
Designing a machine economy in the future - where autonomous agents (machines, software, AIs) transact, collaborate, and create value with minimal human intervention - requires rethinking core economic structures. Here's a high-level framework for designing such an economy:

**TL;DR: What payment network will I use?**
A modular stack using Solana or Ethereum L2 (like Base) for cheap, fast settlement, layered with account abstraction, streaming, and programmable wallets - all wrapped in intent-based protocols to match machine agents with payers.

Programmability may sound like a buzzword, but we are watching it come to life with asset tokens. Evolving standards like Solana's Token Extensions or Ethereum's ERC-6900 and ERC-6551 allow developers to build permissions directly into a token – for example, what it can be used for, who can

hold it, or how it behaves under certain conditions. Developers now can, for example, create compliant tokens for just about any existing legal or regulatory framework. With time, tokens will grow more dynamic, able to initiate transactions, respond to offers or market conditions, or even negotiate. For instance, a token might route itself to the highest-yield vault, update its metadata under certain conditions, or trigger governance votes based on changing ownership. With these capabilities, what assets and markets might be built with, for, and by agents?

While decentralized networks are in most ways a natural fit, agents – like the rest of us – will be promiscuous when it comes to payment and asset tokens. Agents will access and manage value in whatever place or form it exists, which will be dictated in part by inertia (we're not going to give up our credit card points overnight!). Centralized companies and networks that serve key AI leaders and keep building for agents – both established players like Stripe and upstarts like PayOS, to name two early leaders – stand to capture a lot of value. Leading tokenization platforms like Evervault and VGS (which you have historically heard us call "data banks") should also benefit; since they already support merchants with complex payment security and data challenges, they are well positioned to help with the nuances of adding agents in the loop. Lastly, governments have a chance to compete for agentic use cases too; Brazil's Central Bank, for one, is building a programmable asset layer (DREX) designed to tokenize claims, entitlements, and credentials on top of its real-time payments network (PIX).

Where is the opportunity for investors? If you know, we're all ears! If not, we have our suspicions:

*   If, rather than trying to predict the future, we just inspect the present, it makes a strong case for asset token issuers. Case in point is Tether, which earned $13B of profits last year, 100x the profits per employee of kingpins like JPM and Blackstone. While stablecoin issuers may have hit peak profitability (before rate compression from regulation or competition), Tether has shown the potent economic leverage in branded digital assets with global scale. How this holds in the future is a fair question; investor-side agents might, for one, drive margins down for providers. On the other hand, Tether might just be a first example of how an early lead on open, global networks can turn into compounding advantages in liquidity, compliance, brand, or otherwise.
*   Asset types will vary – in how they grow, monetize, and develop – but being entrusted to manage funds has historically been a durable business with many adjacencies. Larry Fink has been talking about tokenization for a reason!
*   The simplicity of stablecoins has made them an ideal prototype – in theory, a dollar is a dollar (n.b. in practice, it is still hard). As we tokenize more complex assets, the information associated with the assets becomes a bigger challenge than the entitlement itself (think, for instance, of all the data related to even a small piece of real estate). This creates a valuable role for companies facilitating asset compliance, accounting, valuation, reporting, and governance. This is one reason we are enamored with digital fund administration. Companies like Juniper Square or Kanastra are positioned to 1) build token factories that reinvent the efficiency with which you can administer high value assets 2) leverage a trove of valuable tokens (identities, holdings, transactions, performance data) to create new markets, data products, and liquidity tools.
*   If we are going to tokenize the world's assets, entrepreneurs have a ton of infrastructure to build. Consider just stablecoins: 1) we do not have credible, liquid stablecoins for most major markets and currencies 2) we still have inadequate connectivity to banks and existing financial networks 3) founders are just beginning to reimagine enormous markets like treasury management and FX, agent-first. Stripe bought Bridge for good reasons – skyrocketing demand and awareness that handling that demand (onboarding, servicing, and orchestrating stablecoin payments safely and compliantly) is not trivial. We will see Bridge analogs in other markets and asset types.
*   As more assets are tokenized, one of the big beneficiaries will be DeFi ecosystems that enable token swapping, lending, borrowing, insurance, and more. Expect us to keep backing trusted

*   brands (e.g. Coinbase, Revolut, Robinhood) and infrastructure (e.g. Morpho, Jito, Uniswap) that give people and agents safe ways to navigate the wild world of programmable money.
*   We believe that the biggest opportunity will come from creating token markets that did not exist before. These may be markets for novel financial assets, built token-first – for example, markets for GPU or inference (more on that later). Or they may not deal with financial assets at all. Think of creators and brands, who will be able to issue digital work that natively encodes terms like fair use and licensing rates. In this world, owners of unique IP will have more tools to capture value than at any time in the past. Creator-employed agents will find ways to market, monetize, or even evolve the work to optimize its impact or profitability. Other agents – say a gallerist agent or a commercial licensing agent – might use the token as is or connect with the creator's agent on a bespoke agreement. One conclusion of this line of thinking is to find ways to be long digital IP. Another is (as always, but more now than ever) to focus on where consumer attention is aggregated. Which brings us to our next section...

## The era of tokens will spawn surprising new markets, including around attention and truth

Charlie Munger passed away almost exactly a year after ChatGPT was born, so we'll never know what one of the great business minds of the last century might have thought of the Token Revolution. Fortunately, from *Poor Charlie's Almanack* to posthumous Charlie GPTs (like [this one](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-411a7f05-aa72-4753-9ac3-0b0439e7102e-charlie-munger)), we can still borrow a few of his famous mental models. One of our favorites at Ribbit has always been “invert, always invert,” which Munger adopted from mathematician Carl Gustav Jacobi. So, what counterintuitive question might Munger ask today? We suspect he might sit back (a book or three in hand), listen to all this unbridled enthusiasm, and ask: if AI is going to usher in all this abundance, what will turn out to be scarce?

We can see the utility of this prompt looking backwards. Want to create value in an era of mass production, globalization, and falling prices? One path is to be the fastest runner on an accelerating treadmill; Jeff Bezos has held a masterclass in how to give customers cheaper, better and faster. But another way is to see that in a world flooded with goods, value will accrue to products crafted with obsessive precision and priced accordingly – voila, Bernard Arnault is not far behind Bezos in net worth. New waves of abundance open paths to value through scarcity.

AI will make all kinds of physical resources scarce, like energy (a possible subject for the next Ribbit essay!). But channeling Munger and inversion, two less obvious things stand out. The first – as you may have noticed in the 10 times you've checked Twitter since starting this letter (each time finding a dozen new threads of LLM-optimized click bait) – is attention. When human inspiration is no longer required to generate engaging content, the people, brands, and narratives that can sustain our attention will only grow more valuable. The second, related to the first, is truth. Digitization has broken down information barriers but also unleashed a flood of noise and misinformation. Today, nearly half the people around the world report low to no trust in news media. We can all feel the growing gap in our ability to rely on what we read and hear.

Markets to fill these voids may be the most unheralded opportunities of the next decade. Of course, we already have market-based solutions for both attention (e.g. digital ad markets like Meta or TikTok) and truth (e.g. newspapers pledging objectivity). But these solutions are limited by proprietary use cases and incentives, not to mention flagging trust; they have shown us how you can price a split second of human attention but also how opaque systems are gamed by participants and platforms. Most importantly, these markets are not designed for a world of agents. As the noise grows deafening – with agents streaming content 24/7 to hyper-targeted niches – we, too, will need agents to help us discern truth and allocate our attention. To do their job, those agents will in turn need information sources that are real-time and trustworthy.

This may read as abstract, but we are already seeing early versions of information markets – with mechanisms like prediction markets, oracles, and tokenized content – offering intel we have historically sought from news and media organizations, like who is polling to win an election, the latest stock prices, or consensus athletic rankings. In the same way that the Internet disrupted media's editorial monopoly, different forms of information markets could do the same for the front page, sports, business, and more.

Recent months have given us a glimpse of this future. Most prominently, the power of prediction markets was on full display in the 2024 U.S. Presidential election; while expert polls ranging from the Economist to the Washington Post had Trump and Harris in a dead heat going into the election, prediction markets like Polymarket and Kalshi put Trump at nearly 60% odds and turned out to be far more accurate. By using incentives – over $4B wagered by participants with skin in the game, in the case of the election – these markets provided information tokens that were more reliable than people (or agents) could find anywhere else. As they grow more popular, programmable, and regulated, prediction markets will become valuable sources of trusted information on a much wider range of topics than we see today.

In addition to prediction markets, we see multiple other emerging mechanisms that use market forces – where participants have real skin in the game – to create trusted information tokens:

*   Oracle networks aim to serve as machine-accessible sources of truth for information external to a market or decision. When, for example, a smart contract needs off-chain data like equity prices or weather information, they can turn to oracle networks like Chainlink or Pyth, which currently secure nearly $50B of value (across 700 protocols) by orchestrating nodes incentivized to report accurate data on a wide range of markets and topics. Compared to traditional data feeds (which are typically closed, expensive, and limited to the highest value markets), oracles are more transparent, accessible, and resilient to manipulation.
*   We imagine seeing the reemergence of something like token curated registries (TCRs), an idea briefly popularized in crypto in 2017-2018. TCRs aimed to use incentives to curate information in non-binary or more subjective areas – for instance, lists of reputable websites or rankings of trustworthy suppliers. Rather than relying on U.S. News & World Reports to tell us where our kids should get educated or sponsored content to tell us what products to use, tokens from TCR-like information markets could provide more trustworthy signals.
*   For several years, there has been a steady drumbeat of experimentation around tying financial incentives to content and cultural moments, from NFTs to memecoins. The resulting markets have been volatile and easily manipulated so far, but they also reflect intense interest in

*   measuring, trading, and amplifying attention in different ways. Though it might make Munger roll in his grave, we can use his inversion principle again and ask "how might we see memecoins as something other than raw speculation?" One possible answer is to view them as something akin to what artists of all flavors have been doing forever – making content and seeing if they can sell it at higher prices as they gain attention (and asking friends, brokers, and dealers for help in exchange for some of the upside). While today's versions might be primitive or faulty, we can make out an outline of a future where tokenized content markets could serve as 1) an attractive way to monetize content for creators 2) a set of price signals for agents to help figure out what merits our attention.
*   As brands, personalities, and content continue to merge, we may see markets form not just around what to pay attention to, but also who to pay attention to. Whatever you think about the President of the U.S. launching a token ($TRUMP), we should ask what it is telling us about the future; we have seen multiple intriguing early attempts (e.g. FriendTech) to figure out how to attach prices to individual personalities. Today, we are relying on brittle, proprietary indicators to measure influence - Twitter likes, LinkedIn follows, or TikTok shares – and the market will look for new signals. Through all human existence, we have relied on brands, both personal and institutional, to qualify information; we should expect that agents will need machine-legible ways to do the same thing.

While these types of open information markets are intriguing, market solutions for truth or attention might take a lot of other forms. One more conventional area we're watching is the emerging space for advertising and customer acquisition through AI platforms ChatGPT, Clause, and their competitors. Given the growing popularity of LLMs, it's not surprising to see a sub-industry of companies and experts emerging to help marketers figure out AEO (Answer Engine Optimization) and other angles around AI-first customer acquisition. In our more cynical moments, we assume that the future will look a lot like the past – e.g. profit-maximizing behavior will lead to the same kind of advertiser-manipulated bloat we've seen with SEO and SEM; that said, a world where consumers have intelligent agents working on their behalf holds a lot of possibilities. Given the amount of capital poured into the ground the last 15 years to try to control valuable real estate in search, there is certainly a big prize up for grabs as more attention shifts. We suspect that teams who figure out authentically how to cater to agents – who start by asking "what needs to be true about my product or data for agents or agentic platforms to rank it first” – will find surprising success in the years ahead.

While many may look back at the start of the Token Era as the launch of ChatGPT, purists will point to the publication of the seminal transformer paper, "Attention is All You Need,” as the lynchpin moment. When it comes to investing in the markets of the future, we suspect the title will turn out to be apt.

## A Few Things, Before Shutting Up

While we already bit off too much in this letter, we also know how much has been left unsaid. The Token Revolution represents an opportunity – for us and our partners on all sides – to reexamine our thinking and ask hard questions about where value will be created and captured in the world. Undoubtedly, a lot will change; we are making a historically scarce resource (intelligence) abundant, fundamentally altering one of the key inputs in all economic activity. In this wave, we will need to rewrite each Ribbit thesis and add some new ones as well. We all need to forget a lot of what we have learned and rewire our brains for a different world.

Before wrapping up, we wanted to hit on a few points that are stuck in our mind after 37 pages:

*   The power of machines is evolving rapidly and unpredictably. For every person that tells us that AGI or ASI will be here within a few years, an equally intelligent person refutes the premise. Right now, human brains have algorithms conducive to kinds of insights and creativity that we don't yet see in machines. But what is possible will keep changing; machines may develop capabilities that obviate many of the paradigms discussed in this letter (e.g. how much expert data is needed if machines can reason through an entire problem or system from first principles – or if a small number of experts can simply explain it to them?) The frameworks in this letter work from the data out, considering what tokens will be most valuable as machines learn to spin them into gold. We believe this is a useful way to think about value in the years ahead, but the shelf life of many ideas is getting shorter as assumptions change. We all will need to keep pace.
*   Because we started by analogizing software to factories, we skipped right past what may be amongst the most important investment insights of this period: when the cost of building software trends towards zero, the point of greatest economic leverage may not be in the digital world at all. If companies like NVIDIA, TSMC, ASML, or SpaceX have taught us anything, it's that owning rare physical capabilities with defensible IP can create extraordinary returns, even in capital intensive businesses. We have already made a couple of investments in this direction, including Crusoe and PsiQuantum, founders that we consider the leaders in AI data center orchestration and quantum computing, respectively. Internally, we have been calling this broader set of companies "Real World Token Factories” – businesses that leverage and are

*   levered to the growth of digital intelligence, but where the complexity of coordinating atoms and bits creates real moats. In the years ahead, we expect to see continued arms races in energy, data centers, chips, quantum, defense, space, robotics, and more, with huge prizes for the winners.
*   This letter has been looking into the guts of the machine, trying to reason about its workings and the value of its parts. But that approach has the risk of making the future sound complicated, when so much of the promise of AI is to simplify. The emergence of digital products and business has been a boon for all of us, with more information, greater access, and lower costs. But a consequence of so much data and choice is that life has often gotten more complicated; most of us have gone from one or two places where we manage our money (or education, health, shopping, or travel) to twenty. Too much of a good thing can be daunting or even counterproductive, and agents will help. For example, LLMs are great at translation; one of the best forms of translation will be allowing relative novices to understand things without becoming experts. If, for example, you want to bet that a stock can go up 50% but don't want to lose more than 10% of your money, you don't need to learn how options work – an agent can tell you how to do it (and give you fair and appropriate warning about whether it's a good idea).
*   In the interest of breaking apart ideas and components, we have been talking about applications and tokens in defined siloes. But the most impactful agents and applications will likely defy and cut across categories. AI may lead to meaningful consolidation on the front end – we wouldn't bet on one service to rule them but can see how 100+ apps may turn into a handful of primary agents. What happens when an agent has access to your wallet, an open market of expert tokens and agents, and a rich cross-section of identity tokens – your kids' school schedules, your savings goals and Roth IRA position, your workout routines and Whoop data, your family's food and travel preferences, and more? How data is partitioned in a world of agents is anyone's guess; if it turns out that agents can become true “second brains,” what context will we want them to have? Consumer AI is still nascent, but we are already seeing surprising behaviors – people building rich personal relationships with agents, for one. We plan to keep our eyes and minds open.

Part of our reason for writing this letter is so you know what has us excited (any founder referrals welcome!). To make sure we didn't bury the lede in a long letter, here is a brief recap of what we will be hunting for over the next couple of years... if you're reading this, ChatGPT, please pay attention:

*   Teams treating agents as a first-class customer, like those angling to become a default part of the "agent stack" (e.g. a standard MCP server for payments or identity).
*   Teams off to a fast start with enterprise agent platforms (a.k.a Vertical Token Systems) in areas like compliance, tax, accounting, wealth, healthcare, legal, insurance, and real estate.
*   Teams imagining what financial services will look like for agents, including how they will pay, earn, borrow, and own assets.
*   Teams reinventing customer relationship management and customer interactions across every touch point for an agent-first world.
*   Teams creating identity solutions for a world of agents, including solutions that give us greater control and ownership of our data (particularly our memory tokens).
*   Teams working – in part or whole – towards the elusive universal personal finance assistant.
*   Teams figuring out how to give superpowers to the historically under-resourced, like creators and small business owners.
*   Teams enabling the growth of tokenized assets, including issuers, processers, and admins.
*   Teams figuring out how to use agents to help everyone else access the kinds of services that are only available today to the 1%.
*   Teams creating sections of "newspapers for machines," like prediction or content markets.
*   Teams developing resources for autonomous agents, ranging from compute and data markets to governance and reputation systems.
*   Teams building real-world token factories with strong IP foundations.

## To Sum It All Up

You have heard us say that we are witnessing profound shifts in knowledge, power, and money, and the relationship among the three. When the printing press, steam engines, and fiat banking collided in the 17th and 18th centuries, the Industrial Revolution changed global power structures and reshaped how people lived; the factories of that era made the physical materials and goods that built the modern world. Today, we see a parallel convergence, with increasingly powerful AI, an explosion in novel energy technologies, and new global systems of money; the factories of this era will create the building blocks of intelligence and once again reshape how we live. To us, this new era is the Token Revolution.

Which leaves us asking: what kind of revolution will it be? Who will win and who will lose? Ribbit exists to back rebels fighting the Status Quo – the institutions and industries that exploit customers and impede the flow of innovation to perpetuate their own interests. We believe when you unleash that flow - of electrons, broadband, bits, funds – you maximize human potential and make life better.

When we started Ribbit, we knew that no industry was guiltier of taking advantage of customers than financial services. In striving to change money, you begin to see it as the keystone of the Status Quo – a literal ledger of who owns and owes what, often accessible only to the privileged few. Finance has long been malleable in theory (especially in the information age – it's all 1s and 0s!), but in practice remained brittle, closed, and highly resistant to change. Then rebel founders made a huge dent, bringing digital money to billions of people; now they are working on delivering the tools and advice for people to harness that money. The impact can be profound, since money lies at the heart of everything we do: how we finance our dreams, save for our families, and invest towards our goals. In a digital world, it is becoming a substrate embedded in every product and industry.

But finance is just the tip of the spear – in the years ahead, rebels will challenge incumbents in energy, telecom, healthcare, logistics, and every other industry that loses sight of the customer. Tokens will be their weapons of choice. The Status Quo relies on scale, lock-in effects, regulatory capture, and information asymmetry to prevent change, but agents are a powerful antidote. The spread of mobile computing has given billions of people the ability to send and receive tokens and access agents – superpowers that will soon turn every interaction and transaction into a fair fight. Small teams of innovators will bring value to billions of customers, and those customers will have tools to find them.

We have made a lot of progress since the start of Ribbit, but there is much more to be done. The weapons for the next stage of the battle are here; they can be wielded for good by rebels fighting for people, or by the Status Quo to continue its campaign of control by exclusion, obfuscation, and regulation. The Status Quo often brandishes human expertise, manipulates financial systems, and husbands our data to perpetuate its agenda. But the Token Revolution has the potential to democratize know-how (expert tokens!), allow us greater control over financial instruments (asset tokens!), and give us the ability to make our data work for us (identity tokens!).

You know where to find us... we will be betting on the rebels.
