## Process Flow Diagram Analysis

This document outlines a process flow, distinguishing between "internal" (orange boxes) and "external" (dark blue boxes) components. Two steps ("La g" and "Nor ation") are indicated as crossed out.

### Legend

*   **internal**: Orange boxes
*   **external**: Dark blue boxes

### Process Steps

#### Top Row (Left to Right)

1.  **Integration** (internal)
    *   Description: connect to FHIR, HL7, RPA, BYOC, etc
    *   Connection: Arrow to `Document parsing`

2.  **Document parsing** (external)
    *   Description: Extend AI extracts fields from charts -> JSON
    *   Connection: Arrow to `La g`

3.  **La g** (internal, *crossed out*)
    *   Description: Label Studio allows SMEs (Dart brings SMEs) to label charts
    *   Connection: Arrow to `Nor ation`

4.  **Nor ation** (external, *crossed out*)
    *   Description: Tuva dbt packages map data tables to a common schema
    *   Connection: Arrow to `Transformation`

5.  **Transformation** (internal)
    *   Description: Converts normalized tables into business/clinical metrics
    *   Connection: Arrow down to `Analysis Engine` and an implied feedback loop from `Analysis Engine`

#### Bottom Row (Left to Right)

1.  **Dashboard Analytics** (internal)
    *   Description: Analytics dashboard showing all autopilots (page 1 of general deck)
    *   Connection: Arrow right to `Deployment + Security`

2.  **Deployment + Security** (external)
    *   Description: Can install inside the customer firewall + guardrails like audit logs, evidence tracebacks and SOC-2 controls.
    *   Connection: Arrow left to `Dashboard Analytics` (implying this step comes after `Review UI + Feedback` to reach `Dashboard Analytics`)

3.  **Review UI + Feedback** (internal)
    *   Description: SME can accept / reject output
    *   Connection: Arrow left to `Deployment + Security`

4.  **Analysis Engine** (external)
    *   Description: SME-written prompts hit an LLM API or fine-tuned embeddings on Dart GPUs shortlist charts, then an LLM reasons over them
    *   Connection: Arrow left to `Review UI + Feedback`, and an arrow pointing up-right towards `Transformation` (indicating feedback or interaction)

### Additional Notes

*   **DartX gives ability to replace with custom model if higher accuracy needed.**
    *   This note is associated with the `Analysis Engine` step, indicated by a gray arrow pointing from the text to the `Analysis Engine` box.
