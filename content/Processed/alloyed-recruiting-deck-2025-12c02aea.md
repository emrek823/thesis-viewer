## Slide 1: Alloyed

**Alloyed**

Consistent candidate flow at a fraction of the cost.

## Slide 2: The Origin / Founder's Note

As a revenue leader, I've interviewed 1000+ sales/GTM folks in the last decade. Many of those candidates came from agency recruiters, and were very high quality. However, the 20%+ price tag left me using agencies as a 'last resort' & ultimately asking the question:

Is it possible to build a recruiting service that delivers on everything I love about working with an agency, but at a price point that is sustainable for continuous hiring?

## Slide 3: What Does a Recruiter Really Do?

![Diagram showing a vertical flow with three steps and their associated workloads.](image3.png)

*   **Step 1: Understand client requirements**
    *   ~10% of total overall workload
*   **Step 2: Find candidates that match requirements & are interested in the role**
    *   ~80% of total overall workload
*   **Step 3: Filter candidates to client**
    *   ~10% of total overall workload

## Slide 4: Finding Candidates - Our Beliefs

*   Candidates not looking for jobs ('passive') are generally higher performers & this is who we target first.
    *   *There are always exceptions to this.
*   It takes ~10-15 qualified interviews to make an educated hiring decision.
    *   It should not take more than 30 days to deliver 10-15 qualified interviews.
*   Fast feedback loops are critical for successful hiring.
    *   We will know within 2 weeks if a role requires adjustments.

## Slide 5: Our Secret Sauce

![Abstract background image in blue and purple tones.](image4.png)

We've automated 80% of the work that takes 80% of a recruiter's time - finding candidates.

### Price

That means we can deliver 10-15 qualified candidate interviews/month at a price point that is ~80% less than standard agency fees.

### Not Just Tech

It's people (global talent) & process too. Standardized (but customizable) workflows are also essential.

## Slide 6: Focus Areas

**Industry:** Logistics & Tech; where our founders have the most expertise.

**Roles:** Go-to-Market (sales development, sales, customer success) + Technical (software engineers, solutions engineers, product managers)

## Slide 7: Who this Works For

### Multiple of the Same Role

Ex: 'We need to add 10 SDRs this year' or '14 software engineers'; this will work across multiple geographies & markets

We average ~$3,000 cost/hire in this scenario

### 1-off Hires

Ex: I need one more enterprise AE

We lose the benefit of scale in this scenario and typically see average cost/hire increase to ~$6,000

## Slide 8: Who this Doesn't Work For

*   You're happy with the quality of inbound candidate applicants
*   You're looking to pay below market relative to candidate background and job requirements
*   You're looking for incredibly niche experience that limits candidate pool (we probably won't get you 10 interviews if there's 50 possible candidates)
*   VP or above level searches

## Slide 9: Our Guarantee

*   An average of 10+ qualified candidates / month. If we can't meet this, we'll let you know before the beginning of an engagement
*   If we tell you we can do it, and we don't, we'll refund whatever portion of the work wasn't delivered.
*   We're never going to sell you a candidate. Our job is to help you make the best, most educated hiring decision possible.

## Slide 10: Implementation

![Flow diagram showing three steps: At Your Pace, 1 Week Go-Live, Feedback.](image5.png)

### At Your Pace

Your hiring needs & timelines run the show, not us.

### 1 Week Go-Live

*   Align on job(s) & candidate requirements (30 minute live meeting)
*   SOP Review (async or live)

### Feedback

15' live syncs for the first few weeks to ensure alignment.
