What You Should Know:

–  Joy Parenting Club, the platform aiming to revolutionize the parenting experience, has announced its acquisition of Heba Care, a technology platform that supports families navigating complex health and developmental needs.

–  This acquisition marks Joy’s latest step in building the most comprehensive support ecosystem for parents.

Integration Brings Clinically Validated Tools and New Tracker to Deliver 24/7 Guidance

Simultaneously, Joy unveiled a new AI-powered tracker for feeding, sleep, and diapers, which is currently in Beta Testing and will roll out to all Joy users within the next 30 to 60 days.

By combining Joy’s expansive platform with Heba’s technology, Joy will scale access to high-quality support for parents globally. Parents who rely on Joy’s AI experts for guidance on child development, everyday parenting, feeding, and sleep will now gain access to Heba’s clinically validated tools to help them navigate, coordinate, and manage their child’s care. Families who previously used Heba, particularly those supporting children with complex health conditions or developmental differences, will have the option to join Joy for an enhanced level of care. According to Emily Greenberg, President of Joy, integrating Heba’s powerful technology and expertise allows the company to reach even more parents globally and continue building the most comprehensive support ecosystem for families. Sam Milliken-Smith, Founder of Heba, noted that joining Joy allows them to advance their mission of helping families never feel alone “further and faster”.

The need for accessible family support is significant, as 80 percent of parents now turn to social media for guidance, and over a third of children’s centers and family hubs have closed since 2009. Joy aims to deliver trusted, 24/7 digital guidance to meet this demand. Heba’s measurable impact was demonstrated in an independent study funded by Innovate UK, showing a 37 percent improvement in care coordination and a 38 percent reduction in stress. This traction complements Joy’s commitment to delivering meaningful, accessible resources through 24/7 expert-led support, curated content, commerce, and parenting services. This acquisition follows Joy’s $14M Series A fundraise in November 2025, which illustrates the company’s vision and tremendous growth in the digital parenting support sector.

Joy is dedicated to building the most advanced AI specifically for parents, giving members 24/7 access to certified parenting experts, from parent coaches to lactation consultants, to help families thrive. Heba Care, founded in 2022, is a digital platform providing care management, coordination, and navigation support to families of children with developmental differences and health conditions. Heba offers a clinically validated, 4.9-star-rated mobile app that supports over 15,000 families across the United Kingdom, United States, Australia, and Canada. Heba works with organizations including the NHS, Bupa, and several national charities.
