# RillaVoice - Vice President of Sales at a Bath Remodeling Company

Interview conducted on August 22, 2023

## Topics
Rilla, Sales, Bath Remodeling, Platform, Training, Metrics, Sales Reps, Competition

## Summary
The Vice President of Sales at a Bath Remodeling Company has been using Rilla, a platform that offers tracking metrics and analytics for their sales process. They find value in using Rilla to monitor struggling sales reps and train new hires, although some reps are resistant due to privacy concerns and the perception that they don't need the platform. The company hires an average of 10 salespeople per month and closely monitors their performance using Rilla. They pay about $25 per user for Rilla and are not looking to expand their user accounts unless the cost is lowered. They have a custom CRM developed in-house and only use Rilla for individual metrics associated with AI analytics. They would consider switching to a competitor if they offered more features at a lower cost, but most sales managers see the value in using Rilla. The Vice President rates their satisfaction with Rilla as an eight out of ten.

**Q: Can you speak to your decision-making when adopting companies such as Rilla?**

**A:** Yes, I'm a decision-maker.

**Tegus Client**
Hello. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. So we are looking to get a bit smarter on Rilla. I understand that you're a current customer. So we just have some questions to run through on your experience with their product, use cases, et cetera. But to start, could you just tell us a little bit about your background, specifically what you do in your company, what your company does, and then we'll go from there.

**Vice President of Sales at a Bath Remodeling Company**
Sure. So I've been with my current employer for about 18 years in the sales department. I started as a sales rep and currently VP of Sales. And most of my time is focused on designing the presentation, managing the sales staff, leading the management team and constructing the training and accountability SOPs for the company.

**Tegus Client**
Got it. And how large is the sales team that you're managing?

**Vice President of Sales at a Bath Remodeling Company**
Currently, we have 102 sales reps and 10 managers covering 12 states.

**Tegus Client**
Got it. And then could you just go into a little more detail on the actual product/service you're offering and who you're selling to?

**Vice President of Sales at a Bath Remodeling Company**
Sure. It is one- to two-day bath remodeling for the residential market.

**Tegus Client**
And is your end customer typically the actual end consumer or like the homeowner?

**Vice President of Sales at a Bath Remodeling Company**
Correct.

**Tegus Client**
And maybe just to get some better context. What's like the average cost of your average service that you're selling to these homeowners?

**Vice President of Sales at a Bath Remodeling Company**
$10,500

**Tegus Client**
Got it. And can you just walk us through the context in which you were introduced to Rilla? How did you hear about it? How long ago was it? Were you actively searching for a solution? Any detail you can provide would be helpful.

**Vice President of Sales at a Bath Remodeling Company**
Sure. So it's probably worth noting or contrasting, the prepandemic era we had management in every location. And so there was obviously more of a physical presence. There's a smaller ratio of trainers and managers to the salespeople where we could conduct in-person meetings, in-person trainings and traditionally would have no other option than to put a manager in a car with the sales rep and physically observe the presentation with the homeowner and then be able to create training feedback based on that observation.

In the postpandemic world, our management team was cut down significantly. So we had to figure out other ways to leverage the technology, so we could be more sensitive towards what was happening out in the field and be able to respond with training feedback, accountability, coaching on a more wide-scale basis with a smaller management team. So that was what initially spurred us to look at other technologies that are out there that could help us get over this challenge.

And so we looked at a few different services that are out there and received product demonstration from each of them. And that was around the time that I was brought into the conversation for making a decision in evaluating this company. And so that's when we chose to go under contract with Rilla, and it's been now roughly two years that we've been using Rilla and have seen reasonable success to make it worthwhile and renewing the contract when that day comes.

**Tegus Client**
Got it. And then is it an annual contract? Or what's the duration?

**Vice President of Sales at a Bath Remodeling Company**
Annual.

**Tegus Client**
Got it. And then you mentioned you looked at a few different services out there. Could you name what the other services were and what your evaluation process was like? Like what were the evaluation criteria that were most important to you and what ultimately led you to choose Rilla?

**Vice President of Sales at a Bath Remodeling Company**
I don't remember the names of the other services at the moment. I want to say one of them was like Silo or Milo or something along those lines. But I can tell you the reason why we ultimately went with Rilla was because it offered the tracking metrics that we were looking for. So we follow a pretty structured systematic approach with our sales process and our presentation, it's a 10-step approach. Just about every step is scripted, at least to a degree.

And so Rilla seemed like it had the features in place that we could input the trackers into being able to monitor the recordings, also be able to do it in a state friendly way because since we're operating in 12 states, we obviously have different consent laws that we need to conform to. So that was part of it.

The tracking mechanisms to implement our 10-step approach to be able to monitor quickly and efficiently and pick up on what's being said, what's not being said, zero in on that and then also be able to provide the feedback within the platform, which can be automatic depending on how the trackers are implemented into the software platform. And then cost was taken under consideration where it seemed like it is the best value option at the time for what we needed. So those are some of the key reasons why we chose Rilla.

**Tegus Client**
Got it. And then could you just elaborate? Just because we're still trying to get a better understanding of what the actual platform and features are. Could you kind of walk me through in more detail what the tracking metrics you're referring to? Or maybe you can use like a very tangible example of, I don't know, a specific app. Or when you open up the platform on a certain day where a sales rep is, like what does that tracking metric feature look like?

**Vice President of Sales at a Bath Remodeling Company**
Sure. So we have teams set up within different regions in the company in different offices. And as far as the trackers are concerned, let me take a step back for a second. We don't require it on all of our salespeople for a couple of reasons that I can get into if you want me to. But to answer your initial question in terms of the trackers, basically we can take keywords or key phrases and put them into the program and put them into a category, which is defined by the step in the process, so whether that's stepper one.

So for example, I could have any number of trackers for step one, two, three and so on. So it gives us a way that we can keep that organized and in the proper sequence. And then within each of these trackers, it's basically like a phrase within a script. So being cognizant of the fact that you have people speaking different ways.

If we were to put in the script verbatim into the trackers, it would not pick up a person's way of saying it because they might not be verbatim on script, whereas if you use a phrase, it's going to be more accurate in picking up a wide range of people who are speaking that particular part of the script or asking a question or making a statement, and it's going to have a more accurate pickup of that, that tracker is being used.

**Tegus Client**
That makes sense. So it's just certain phrases you want your sales reps to hit at different parts of their scripts in the different steps.

**Vice President of Sales at a Bath Remodeling Company**
Yes.

**Tegus Client**
And then in terms of the analytics that come with that, like could you speak to how advanced the analytics on the platform are? Like do you find it helpful? I'm curious. So they track whether or not people hit those certain phrases, like is there like an additional level or layer of analytics on top of that?

**Vice President of Sales at a Bath Remodeling Company**
Yes. So there's several different analytics that we pay attention to. One of them is going to be the average talk time, so that gives us a gauge for how much the sales rep is speaking versus how much the customer is speaking. It will also give us a talk ratio percentage. It will give us the amount of seconds in response after a customer speaks to when the sales rep responds.

So it will give you a better gauge on how well the sales rep is listening, when they're talking too much and giving the customer their space to be able to elaborate on whatever topic they might be on. It'll also give us a percentage for their appointments that are actually recorded. So even though we might set the expectation to record all of them, they might not necessarily do so for a variety of reasons.

We look at the longest monologue time. So basically, it will track is the sales rep getting more long-winded than we would expect. We can also compare that with the customer monologue. And also the speed at which they speak, it will record the number of words per minute and the interactivity dialogue between the salesperson and customer.

**Tegus Client**
That's helpful. And I'm curious, all these metrics, do you find that you're constantly referring back to them for a particular sales rep? I guess my point is like for one sales rep, do they track all of these metrics over time and like automatically flag to you if something seems off or there are any negative changes? Or is something you kind of have to just manually track?

**Vice President of Sales at a Bath Remodeling Company**
Yes. There are settings within the trackers that you can set to create automatic feedback for the salesperson and automatic notification for the sales manager. So that's helpful. I should also point out that we made a decision when we started this platform that we weren't going to require it across the board for a couple of reasons. One reason we didn't really have full compliance, voluntary compliance of all our salespeople.

So there are some people that naturally have concerns about privacy and their personal content and what they say and how they say it. They don't necessarily feel comfortable sharing that with the rest of the organization. And there were specific examples that we basically had good, seasoned salespeople that produce at a high level, and we didn't want to jeopardize that working relationship.

The other reason was because of the cost involved. So between those two reasons, we only have it, the number of licensed accounts, for probably about 1/4 of our total salespeople. And the people that we chose to put on the platform were either new, so they don't really know any different. And then we could just use it as a basic training tool through their first 90 days.

And then also the people that have been underperforming regardless of how long they have been tenured with the company. We could serve it up as a tool to help their performance and results and get them back on track. And if they decided for whatever reason that they weren't willing to do that, it would just be an easier way to part ways with that particular employee.

**Tegus Client**
Thank you for providing that color. I'm actually very curious about, you mentioned one of the reasons why you don't have everyone use this because you don't want to jeopardize the working relationships between you and like your highest performing sales reps. I guess I have two parts to the question. One is like in your industry broadly, is like recruiting or retaining like sales reps, like would you say is that like a major issue for you?

Yes. So the way we kind of were modeled is that we have a brief paid training program while they're going through the technical training and the basic sales classroom type training for the first couple of weeks. But generally speaking, after that, they go on a full commission basis. So naturally, when you're dealing with full commission salespeople, if they don't start making money quickly, then they lose their confidence or quit or both, and then we're back to the drawing board.

So the retention, the cost for us as a company in bringing in recruiting, new salespeople, hiring them, training them, providing the materials, getting them up to speed and getting them through the learning curve is one of the biggest costs that we have to deal with in our, at least in the sales department. And therefore, the retention of those salespeople becomes the biggest area of value to focus on, the more we can retain, it makes the whole rest of the business run much smoother.

**Tegus Client**
Got it. And as a follow-up to that then, and please correct me if you interpret this differently. Like my interpretation of Rilla was that, so I understand like the privacy part, maybe not wanting to have every single part of the conversation recorded throughout the day, but isn't the whole value prop of Rilla, and maybe it's different for the actual sales rep versus the manager, but in order to help them increase their sales performance.

And so I'm curious like what the primary like pushback from sales reps is? Is it just the privacy part? Or like do you attempt to push back and say, hey, this is like meant to helping you like improve your performance? And because you mentioned one of the reasons for attrition was like for them making money within the first few months. Like how do you position Rilla towards your sales reps?

**Vice President of Sales at a Bath Remodeling Company**
Yes. So I think as a salesperson myself, I obviously see a high level of value in the way things are framed, presented and asked for in all aspects of internally and externally within the company, personally and professionally. And so my point is that the way that it is presented to the staff is very important.

The way it's presented to the management is critical. The way it's presented to the salespeople, the people that you asked to do it, and why you're asking them to do it. And I think as long as it's positioned in the correct way, and people understand that the reasons are to benefit the individual more than anything, then it's much better well received.

Also in how it's explained to the customer, there's a script because we're dealing with disclosure laws state to state, we obviously need to disclose to the people we see that the conversation is being monitored. And the way that is presented to a customer is also equally important.

**Tegus Client**
Yes. And you mentioned two factors kind of push back from employees because of like the privacy part and then to the cost involved of getting licenses for sales reps. Let's say we take cost aside and say that wasn't a consideration or an issue, do you feel like you would be able to get all of your sales reps using Rilla without like significant issues?

**Vice President of Sales at a Bath Remodeling Company**
Well, I can speculate and part of it is through direct experience when we initially sort of announced this to the company we were utilizing a platform like this. There's, I would say, probably the top 10% of our seasoned salespeople throughout the company, they've already proven themselves, proven their value to the company. They know what they're doing. They perform at a high level.

They don't necessarily see the value for those individuals to make their presentation public within the company and because they don't feel like they need it, and it would just be like big brother watching over their shoulder and it would be more of a liability for them than anything else.

So that's one of the driving factors. One of the other factors is that you have some individuals that don't like to share. And if they do something, because we have a competitive stack, they don't necessarily want to

help the people that they're competing with by sharing their secrets within their presentation. So those are two of the reasons. And then you have just the general privacy concern.

**Tegus Client**
That's super helpful. My next question, and I guess you already answered it, but I was going to ask like do you use Rilla or have you thought about using Rilla recordings for the those top-performing reps as training material for the rest of your team or like new hires? But it's interesting you mentioned like the kind of the competitive aspect of this, which I didn't consider.

**Vice President of Sales at a Bath Remodeling Company**
Yes. So now we still do have other salespeople within the company that are high producers and perform well that are still willing to volunteer for this platform. And there definitely is value in that because one of the metrics within the platform allows you to compare what the top reps are saying to the bottom performing reps and also be able to, like we basically have an API set up where we're able to track the recording to the result of the appointment to know whether it was a sale or not a sale.

And so we can sort of get a more clear picture on the people that are following the script in the system to a high percentage and also correlate that to the results. It gives us good feedback for being able to identify, are there opportunities here that as a company, we should revise or modify our system to include things that might not be currently scripted out. So having that top rep feedback is very valuable to have a mix of both.

But if I looked at the majority of the value that we're getting out of the platform, it's mostly coming from being able to identify or being able to monitor struggling sales reps that regardless of where they are in the country, be able to do that remotely. It saves a lot of time, it saves the drive time and it allows us to not have to listen to a whole presentation from Quebec because our average presentation is about 2.5 hours.

So having the ability to fast forward through the recording to go to specific key points, gives us a very quick and efficient framing of where this person needs help, what they're saying or not saying and then be able to zero in on that. But the majority of what we use it for are all of our new people because that's going to be the people we don't get any sort of pushback from it. They understand it's there to help them. And as long as we can get them to embrace the technology and follow through with it, then that's where the biggest value is for us.

**Tegus Client**
Great. You literally just answered my next follow-up question, which is in your own words then, how would you describe Rilla's main value prop to you? And in the context of your main use cases, like helping train and get new reps to speed, how often are you bringing on new sales reps?

Is it like on an ad hoc basis? Do you do them in like batches, like at certain points throughout the year? I'm trying better understand basically like the frequency at which you, as a manager, are like actively using Rilla. Like do you use it on a daily basis? Or just when it's monitoring the new hires for a certain amount of time?

**Vice President of Sales at a Bath Remodeling Company**
I would say, including my team of management that each manager is listening to these recordings, on average, at least two or three times a week, if not more. And in terms of putting that into sort of what it looks like for the first 90 days of employment, once we're ready to put them on leads because that's where our biggest cost is, it's going to be generating the appointment setting, qualifying and confirming that appointment.

So by the time we issue that to a sales rep, there's a high risk-reward for a person who is brand new, whether or not they're going to waste it or be able to convert it to a sale and give us the return on investment. So that's where the largest part of my responsibility is and we track every salesperson with many metrics in terms of what they do with those leads, what the results of those leads are.

So getting back to your question about when is it appropriate, when do we deem it necessary and things of that nature, I would say that we're hiring on average 10 salespeople per month throughout the company and

putting them through the training process. They're all going into Rilla within three weeks of employment, their first week of running leads.

And then we're closely monitoring their first 10 appointments because we know statistically that if we can help that sales rep convert at least three out of those first 10 appointments, then we have a reasonable chance of success going forward from there. And then we just look for incremental progress basically.

But that gives us the baseline that we're looking forward to know that they have the capability, the coachability and the confidence to be able to perform well in this job, assuming that they enjoy it. Now the other scenario where we would require it, regardless of how long they've been here, is when we have somebody who's been struggling for more than two months or actually more than a month, then we serve this tool up as part of their personal improvement plan and require them to use it until we see improvement.

**Tegus Client**
Got it. And then on that note, in terms of like licenses, how does that work? Like do you have like a set of new hires use your existing Rilla licenses and then they cycle out, and then you have the next set of new hires or people who need refreshing, sharing those same licenses? Like how do the licenses work across your team?

**Vice President of Sales at a Bath Remodeling Company**
Yes. So we have two product divisions. I'm responsible for the bath remodeling sales department. We have another division for kitchen refacing. And so between the two different accounts or the different divisions, we have somewhere in the neighborhood of about 35 licensed accounts.

So we had a little bit of a contention with Rilla because their preference in the way that the AI works is they recommend the longest usage, to not really change from one account to the next, one person to the next, but that the more that you develop the analytics within the software of each user, the more accurate the analytics will be and useful.

And so although I believe all that to be true, the reality for us is that we only need it for one individual user until they're performing well. And then beyond that, it becomes practical for us to not require that user anymore and to give it to somebody else who's brand new coming in. So yes, to answer your question, most of the switching from one account to the other is because of turnover and new people coming in or it's because the person is now performing well so we want to give them some breathing room and no longer require them to use it.

**Tegus Client**
Got it. And then on that topic, can we talk a little bit about how much you're spending on Rilla per year. And a ballpark figure is fine. And whether or not you expect that to increase or maybe stay the same or decrease?

**Vice President of Sales at a Bath Remodeling Company**
I believe we're paying about $25 per user. And it's somewhere between $35 and $50, the last I checked, total accounts between the two product divisions. And if Rilla were to be able to negotiate that with us and lower their costs, then I would be in favor of increasing our user accounts. But until if and until that ever occurs, where they're willing to lower it and negotiate on that, then we're not really looking to expand our user accounts at this time, at this rate.

**Tegus Client**
Got it. And then in terms of your broader, you call it tech stack that you use in your day-to-day or your team uses in their day-to-day, I'm trying to better understand like what tool is your ultimate source of truth. Is it like a Salesforce type tool, like what do you connect Rilla to? Or actually based on what you're saying, maybe Rilla is not your source of truth just given.

**Vice President of Sales at a Bath Remodeling Company**

Yes. We have a custom CRM. So it's been developed in-house. And beyond that, I can't really get in more detail on that.

**Tegus Client**
Got it. But is it safe to say that CRM for you is like your ultimate source of truth versus storing things in Rilla.

**Vice President of Sales at a Bath Remodeling Company**
Yes. The only thing that we're going into Rilla for is going to be for the individual metrics that are associated with their AI analytics. Everything else in terms of the sales results, for the most part, we pull out of our internal systems.

**Tegus Client**
That's helpful. And then I'm curious like how you view the broader defensibility of Rilla. I don't know if you're familiar with Gong. It's a similar premise, but obviously not for like sales reps who are physically out in the field. I guess I'm trying to say like how difficult do you think it is for another company to replicate what Rilla has done? What would maybe prompt you to consider another option, and have you since the two years in which you started using Rilla?

**Vice President of Sales at a Bath Remodeling Company**
I think that if a competitor came to us and could show us more features at a lower cost, lower price point, then we would be wide open to that, consider that offer.

**Tegus Client**
Other specific features you had in mind that you'd like to have that Rilla currently doesn't have?

**Vice President of Sales at a Bath Remodeling Company**
Yes. And I don't know how feasible this is, but I can tell you that in our business, there's a lot of what we do, which is very nuanced. And what I mean by that is being able to be accurate to a script is one thing, but being able to also sort of find a way to measure humor and tone and other forms of communication that aren't necessarily verbal, would be interesting.

And think as somebody who designs the sales presentation, designs the training manual and the coaching process, being able to pick up on some of the things that you can only traditionally do in person when you can see visually the people in the room.

You can read their body language, you can hear their tone, their cadence, the eye contact, again, I realize that some of these things are going to be technically impossible for a platform like this. But I think that there's still probably room to pick up on more nuanced of an in-home sales presentation, which is a one-call close process.

**Tegus Client**
Yes. And you mentioned that you would be wide open to consider or switch to an alternative if they were cheaper, had more features. What do you perceive the switching cost of relatively, in other words, like how sticky is the platform or how difficult or disruptive would it be if, let's say, tomorrow, I had you switch from Rilla to a competitor? I guess, I don't know how integrated it is to your CRM or anything else or like how disruptive it would be to your daily workflow, like basically trying to gauge how difficult that switch.

**Vice President of Sales at a Bath Remodeling Company**
Technically, it wouldn't be too cumbersome at all, I don't think. I mean I think originally, when I set up all the trackers to put into the platform, maybe it took me less than 10 hours, I would guess, to put in all the information that we need. So a couple of days to focus on it, and it would be very minor for me.

If I could see a long-term increase in the bottom line than it would be well worth the time spent on my part. The bigger part of the transition would probably be just getting my team of managers familiar and

comfortable with how to use it. So assuming that it was a user-friendly platform, then I wouldn't foresee it as a difficult transition.

**Tegus Client**
Got it. And then anecdotally, do you and the rest of your sales managers like using Rilla? Like do you view it as more of a nice-to-have or a must-have? And then anecdotally, how do your sales reps feel about it overall?

**Vice President of Sales at a Bath Remodeling Company**
So I think out of nine managers, I have seven that use it regularly, see the value in it themselves. I don't have to pressure them to use it or force them to use it. They see the value because the alternative for them is they have to take half a day get out in the car and go see it in person, so which none of them are volunteering for. So for that reason, they all see the value in it. It's not hard to get them on board with it.

**Tegus Client**
Got it. And like qualitatively, what's like the rest of the pushback from your two other managers?

**Vice President of Sales at a Bath Remodeling Company**
I think that they're just old school in how they manage and coach salespeople that they, for whatever reason, they feel more comfortable actually getting in a car and having that face-to-face with the rep taking them out to launch, having the conversation in the car afterwards. That's their style of coaching, it's what they're comfortable with. And as I'm sure you know, getting people to change their ways after they've been doing it for so many years is a whole another challenge in and of itself.

**Tegus Client**
Yes. And what about with your sales reps? I know we mentioned some of like the privacy concerns or just like top-performing sales reps maybe not wanting to share their secrets, what about for like the new hires or people who needs some catching up to do. Like what has been the general sentiment towards Rilla and the experience?

**Vice President of Sales at a Bath Remodeling Company**
There haven't been any cases where a new salesperson has refused and where it's gotten up to my level of attention, none that I can point to. I think that if they were hesitant to use it, I would suspect that the only reason we would have a new person who has anxiety about using the platform is because of the lack of confidence or competency in themselves and to feel or to think that they're going to be exposed, that they don't really know what they're doing or maybe they're not a good fit for the job.

Which is also hugely important to us, like if we have a new salesperson who doesn't believe that they can do this job or they have the right personality for the job, it's very valuable for us to uncover that right away. And sometimes that's what happens. Sometimes we hear the recording, and we know based on what we hear and what we see that they are so far off the program or their personality is going to fit, that it's not even worth any sort of feedback. We just need to get them out.
