THE ECOSYSTEM

## Slide 5: Unstructured healthcare data is worth billions. But it's incredibly difficult to work with

Unstructured healthcare data
is worth billions.
But it's
incredibly difficult
to work with

### ! Regulated

Every dataset requires
HIPAA Expert Determination
at least annually or
whenever data is
modified/refreshed.

### ! Fragmented

Data is combined from
multiple sources, data
providers, and is incredibly
messy.

### ! Multimodal

Data is unstructured, and
composed of multiple
formats and types
(imaging, audio, text,
geospatial, etc)

### ! High volume

Healthcare data collection is
exploding year-over-year by
orders of magnitude\*

\*Up to trillions from hundreds of millions of records produced annually.

THE PROBLEM

## Slide 6: AI has unlocked previously inaccessible insights from unstructured healthcare data

AI has unlocked previously inaccessible
insights from unstructured healthcare data

**SURGING DEMAND FOR DATA**
Enterprises are purchasing
more and more unstructured
data to rapidly unlock
previously inaccessible
insights for commercial,
research, and AI use cases.

**EXPLOSIVE SUPPLY OF DATA**
To feed the booming
enterprise demand, existing
data sellers are scaling their
supply and new data sellers
are entering the market.

**INCREASED REGULATORY SCRUTINY**
With more activity, regulatory
scrutiny is one the rise.
Compliance standards and
exposure are an increasing
concern for enterprises.

WHY NOW

THE SOLUTION

## Slide 8: The process from data purchase to data decision today

The process from data purchase
to data decision today

*   **UNLOCK**
    *   Gather and/or fetch purchased, non-compliant data
*   **CLEAN**
    *   Detect compliance errors in datasets and produce compliant datasets
*   **ENRICH**
    *   Contour and transform data to boost the value of the dataset
*   **CERTIFY & DEPLOY**
    *   Deliver compliance reports and compliant data
*   **INSIGHTS**
    *   Review, analyze trends, research, and produce business insights
*   **DECISIONING**
    *   Make decisions for particular use case leveraging previous data actions

Today's process takes 2-3 months per dataset,
and must be repeated over and over.
