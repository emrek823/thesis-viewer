## Slide 4: Drug Discovery Has a Foundational Data Problem
The bottleneck isn't algorithms — it's access to quality data

*   **Public Datasets**
    *   Hard to Access
    *   No natural language interface

*   **Novel Datasets**
    *   Extremely Expensive
    *   Prohibitive cost to generate

*   **Labeled Datasets**
    *   No Scale Providers
    *   Missing infrastructure for annotation

## Slide 5: SOLUTION: BioStack - Full Stack Scale AI for Drug Discovery
One platform. Natural language. Real experiments.

1.  **Access**
    *   Query massive public datasets with natural language
2.  **Design**
    *   AI-driven custom molecule generation
3.  **Validate**
    *   Trigger real experiments with clicks
