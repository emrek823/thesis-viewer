## Abstract
The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), as amended by the Over-the-Counter Monograph Drug User Fee Amendments (herein referred to as "OMUFA II"), authorizes the Food and Drug Administration (FDA, the Agency, or we) to assess and collect user fees from qualifying manufacturers of over-the-counter (OTC) monograph drugs and submitters of OTC monograph order requests (OMOR)s for fiscal years 2026 through 2030. In this notice, FDA is announcing the OMOR fee rates for fiscal year (FY) 2026. FDA plans to announce the FY 2026 OMUFA facility fee rates, i.e., monograph drug facility (MDF) and contract manufacturing organization (CMO) facility fee rates, in a subsequent Federal Register notice (and anticipates its issuance will generally align with the timing of the OMUFA facility fee rate publication for prior FYs).
