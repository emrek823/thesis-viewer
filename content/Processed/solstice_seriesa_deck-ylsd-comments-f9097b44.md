## Slide 13

How Phathom Pharmaceuticals Replaced Omnicom with Solstice

With Solstice:
Solstice has powered creation of digital assets including HCP emails, banner ads, and social content across multiple channels. 
Solstice enabled Phathom to systematically update affected content across their entire asset library during an FDA label update, saving the organization $500,000

Impact
$2M agency cost savings within first 3 months
Time from inception to MLR approval went from 2 months -> less than 2 weeks

“It’s like freaking amazing that that platform understands everything we do and talks our language, like amazing.” 
- Leona Ling, Senior Director of Marketing

CASE STUDY

Their agency of record, charges them millions a year but the core campaign elements have already been made. 

Most remaining work is executional to rework content and reframe positioning.

Given cost constraints, Phathom only creates content when absolutely needed. As a result, 
they have poor HCP awareness.

Context: 
Phathom launched their only asset, Voquezna, in late 2023.

## Slide 14

How Alexion scaled Solstice from a pilot to across a brand within a quarter.

With Solstice:
Launched an entirely new “Early Vax” campaign with banners, emails and brochures within a month
Replaced Indegene’s entire team with a single engagement lead and Solstice’s platform will increasing content velocity and MLR approval rates

“We are going to be the most efficient brand team in the US, thanks to Solstice”
- Kristine Saffrin, Associate Director, US Patient Marketing

Impact
Volume of new content produced increased 2.5x
Expanded Solstice across the entire gMg indication and to NMOSD as well

CASE STUDY

Alexion received FDA approval to treat generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) for their drug Ultomiris in 2022, quickly becoming the market leader.

Due to their parent company’s (AstraZeneca) mandates and cost constraints, the marketing team was forced to use Indegene, a BPO for all derivative content. 

Quality was abysmal – taking 3 MLR cycles on average for content approval. A single line update to an email could take a month.
