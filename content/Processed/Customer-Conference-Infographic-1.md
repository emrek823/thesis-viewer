AI-BASED PROVIDER EDUCATION EMPOWERS HEALTHCARE PAYERS TO SHIFT LEFT ON THE PAYMENT CYCLE

Codoxo Customers Share Inside Look at Provider Behaviors

A recent survey among Codoxo's healthcare payer customers sheds new light on the dire need for the payment integrity industry to "shift left" through the adoption of AI-based provider education as a means of AI-based provider education to maximize coding accuracy and increase savings.

Here's what we found out:

THE IMPORTANCE OF OFFERING PROVIDER EDUCATION

100%
of customers surveyed are working with providers to educate them on billing and coding performance.

PROVIDERS SHARE PREFERRED COMMUNICATION STYLE WITH PAYERS

When communicating with providers, healthcare payer cost containment teams should consider emails and phone calls, with fax and phone call remaining relevant:

Email
Phone
Letter
Fax
All of the above

ACCESS TO SELF-SERVICE MONITORING

75%
of health plans report that their providers do not have access to self-service monitoring of their billing and coding performance compared to their peers.

PRIORITIZING PRE-PAY SUBMISSIONS

Most healthcare organizations focus their cost containment efforts on pre-pay, with post-pay and pre-claim submission following:

8%        54%        38%
Pre-Claim    Pre-Pay    Post-Pay
Submission

THE NEED FOR A PROVIDER EDUCATION PLATFORM

62%    38%
Only 38% of payment integrity special investigation unit (SIU) teams use an automated provider education platform – that means 62% do not.

A NEW FRONTIER IS POSSIBLE

As the industry shifts to the "left" with pre-claim submission efforts, they need tools to empower collaboration with providers and create transparency into provider coding and education performance.

Introducing AI-Based Provider Education

By adopting proactive AI-based provider education, including a provider self-monitoring portal, transformation is possible:

$4,000-$7,000 PMPY (per member per year) cost avoidance savings can be realized.

$2M-$3.5M in cost avoidance annually for a mid-size health plan with 500k members.

That's transformation.
