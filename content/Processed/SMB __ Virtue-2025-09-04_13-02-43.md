### Team Hiring & Performance

- Erik performing excellently since starting Tuesday
	- Very strong on BD side - target: bring in 2 AMCs
	- Priority: get Nash Bio through the door, signed and moving
	- Already hitting ground running with aggressive outreach to warm leads
	- Heather (advisor facilitating National Biosciences relationship) very positive about his approach
- Irsyad delivering exceptional results after 2 weeks
	- Finishing first publication for September 20th submission
	- Defended PhD thesis after starting (didn’t want to wait)
	- Created detailed Gantt chart showing current status and acceleration plans
	- Profile: https://linkedin.com/in/irsyad-adam-02a1a7196
	- Location decision pending: either move to Philly or establish SF Bay Area office
- 3 preprints releasing September 22nd
	- 2 submissions to ICLR
	- Paired blog posts for market visibility
- Talent density receiving external validation
	- Ex-Stripe engineering leader noted “insanely high” concentration of talent

### Pharma Partnerships Progress

- Sanofi on track with written commitment from Galen
	- Needs acceleration to make partnership public this month or next
	- Meeting early next week to finalize timeline
	- Use cases: immunology, universal patient representations for PTRS optimizing asset pipelines
	- Toronto meeting planned with AI team to ensure their success
- BMS proposal under review at VP level in drug development
	- Matches their strategic priorities
	- Cash constraints noted (recent Bane spinout due to development funding gaps)
	- Still valuable for incredible data assets
- Target pharma prospects identified:
	- J&J: former colleague now director doing AI partnerships
	- Novartis: CDO Maruna (Galen’s wife) potential intro after Sanofi closes
	- Merck: Trisha Kerrigan (advisor, former VP) plus Eric’s Prometheus connection
	- AstraZeneca: complicated by Tempus relationship

### Academic Medical Centers & Data Partnerships

- MD Anderson relationship expanding
	- Now 3 active projects (started with 1)
	- Increased urgency from their team
	- Malia providing excellent feedback: zero-shot SMB performance 5% better than unimodal outcomes
- Nash Bio partnership developing rapidly
	- Exclusive vendor of Vanderbilt’s multimodal data (especially whole genome sequencing)
	- License to 7 pharma partners at $10M annually
	- C-suite shakeup creating partnership opportunity:
		- CCO departed for biotech role
		- CTO retired (spouse high-earning orthopedic surgeon)
	- Spinning out new company based on multi-institutional data assets
	- Seeking SMB as technical partner for foundation model training
	- Potential distribution partnership leveraging existing pharma relationships
	- Kevin flying to Vanderbilt for in-person meetings

### Market Positioning & Fundraising Strategy

- Tempus competitive analysis
	- Building V1 internally with 20-30 person team
	- Leadership structure unclear (3 people from different divisions)
	- Likely to need external partnership for V2 when internal limitations surface
- Vision: backbone of all biomedical AI applications within 10 years
	- Winner-take-all opportunity due to data silos requiring scale beyond any single organization
	- Revenue share model planned (Spotify-style: more data contributed = more benefits received)
	- API-first approach: future biomedical AI will call SMB instead of Anthropic
- Market validation emerging
	- Live AI reversed position from dismissive to urgent partnership request
	- Mid-September delivery deadline for Friends of Cancer project
- JP Morgan preparation timeline confirmed for January fundraising
