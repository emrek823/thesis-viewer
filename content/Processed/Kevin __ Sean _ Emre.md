# Kevin from Standard Model Bio & Sean/Emre Meeting Summary

### Company Overview: Standard Model Bio

- Foundation model approach to patient representation
	- Horizontal layer that other companies build on top of
	- Integrates all patient data types: CT scans, genomic sequencing, longitudinal records
	- Goal: Create fundamental representation of what it means to be a human patient
- Kevin’s background
	- Previously at Bristol Myers Squibb working with their immuno-oncology dataset
	- Realized foundation models would dominate biomedical AI
	- Left to create Standard Model when BMS wouldn’t spin them out

### Business Model & Approach

- Provides models to partners rather than building applications
	- Prefers giving partners the model directly with training on their data
	- Uses agentic interface as needed for big pharma
	- Does not own the final application layer
- Team philosophy
	- Small, highly competent team that moves quickly
	- Low profile and humble approach
	- Give partners the credit, especially academic partners
	- Focus on the 90% rather than the last mile implementation

### Value Proposition for Pharma & Healthcare

- Accelerates biomedical AI by reducing data silos
- Improves clinical development process
	- Can shorten time to approval (worth hundreds of millions)
	- Helps with site selection (30-50% of sites never recruit patients)
	- Trials often delayed 9-18 months due to recruitment issues
- Enables end-to-end optimization across the patient journey
- Bridges commercial and clinical decision-making
	- Budget comparison: commercial > clinical development (4x discovery)
	- Creates unified patient representation that spans silos

### Future of Pharma & Treatment

- Treatment decisions becoming more algorithmic
	- Mirror between clinical decision support and treatment selection algorithms
	- Pharma needs to adapt to this reality beyond “weathering it like IRA”
	- Will need to integrate algorithmic approaches into clinical trials
	- Market impact will depend on how often treatments are selected by CDS systems
- Commercial impacts
	- Changes pharma marketing for serious diseases
	- Academic medical centers will lead, pharma will follow

### Partnership Approach

- Data partnerships critical to model improvement
	- Capital efficient way through partnerships
	- Can supplement with biobank access when needed
- Partner selection strategy
	- Target those who need solutions fast
	- Focus on partners who understand foundation model value
	- Work with those who believe proprietary data isn’t their main value driver
	- “Collaborate on tools, compete on assets” mindset in pharma
- Challenge with big pharma dynamics
	- Data scientists want to do it themselves vs stakeholders just wanting solutions
	- Need to find right internal champions

### Capital & Resource Needs

- Two main investment areas:
	- Hiring high quality talent (especially forward deployed engineers)
	- Data acquisition to improve models
- Values investor advice and introductions
	- Appreciates Eric introduction
	- Open to hearing different perspectives
- Not focused on raising large amounts of capital
	- Aiming to stay nimble with small, efficient team
	- Delaying fundraising by about a month
