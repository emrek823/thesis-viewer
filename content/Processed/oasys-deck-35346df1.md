## Slide 2: Therapist Pain Points

"I know there's more to their [wellbeing], but without the right resources, I have to piece together fragments, which is not always the whole story."

"Every week, I spend as much time on paperwork and admin stuff as I do talking with my patients..."

"It's frustrating to know there's so much vital information out there [...] that is just out of reach."

– Therapists today

## Slide 3: Disconnected Mental Health Care

Mental health care is largely disconnected from the broader context of our lives

### Diagram:
*   **Patients**
    *   (disconnected lines to various data types)
*   Physiological data
*   Genetic data
*   Lab tests & bloodwork
*   Environmental factors
*   Self-reported data
*   **Therapists**
    *   (disconnected line from Therapists to Patients)

## Slide 4: Democratizing Access to Data

But mass adoption of wearables and trackers is democratizing access to rich data streams

### Diagram:
*   **Data Sources (Wearables/Apps)**
    *   Apple Health (connected to Oasys)
    *   Flo (connected to Oasys)
    *   Whoop (connected to Oasys)
    *   Dexcom (connected to Oasys)
    *   Fitbit (connected to Oasys)
    *   Oura (connected to Oasys)
*   **Oasys** (central hub)
*   **Therapists** (connected to Oasys)

### Statistic:
*   44% of Americans own wearables¹

## Slide 5: Supercharged Operational Solutions

Therapists spend 7–10 hours per week outside of sessions consolidating notes into formal reports and treatment plans

### Chart: Session Time Breakdown
*   A pie chart showing two segments. The larger segment is dark teal, representing the majority of time. The smaller segment is light teal, representing less time.
*   **Data Interpretation:** On average, therapists spend 17 minutes per hourly session on basic intake tasks.

Our initial platform increases practice efficiency with the following features:
*   Enriched clinical notes and treatment plans
*   Comprehensive RPM dashboards
*   Pre-charting and session preparation
*   End-to-end documentation management

We've built supercharged operational solutions for therapists with real-time data integration

## Slide 6: Building Towards Predictive Models

Building towards the bigger picture: predictive models for mental health

### Timeline / Roadmap:
*   **Launch wedge product with therapist tools**
    *   Bottom-up testing with early adopters
    *   Demonstrate value in clinical and nonclinical operations
*   **Expand to full practice management**
    *   Replace legacy platforms for private practices
    *   Streamline workflows for coding and billing
*   **Enterprise white-labeling**
    *   Horizontal penetration across 100+ therapy networks
    *   Secure large contracts to drive scalable growth
*   **Develop clinical prediction models** (highlighted box)
    *   Train proprietary ML models on novel datasets
    *   Data-driven intervention pathways→ proactive care

## Slide 7: From Reactive to Proactive Mental Health Care

Our infrastructure can take us from reactive to proactive mental health care

### Diagram:
*   **Proprietary dataset creation**
    *   physical & genetic data
    *   + environmental context
    *   + therapist analysis and user-reported data
*   **Cutting-edge ML models** (connected from Dataset creation)
    *   multi-modal fusion
    *   multi-task learning models
    *   time-series analysis
    *   federated learning
*   **Use cases** (connected from ML models)
    *   early diagnosis
    *   preventive care
    *   personalized coverage

## Slide 8: Servicing the Growing Mental Health Ecosystem

Servicing the growing mental health ecosystem shows a clear path to venture scale

### Global Mental Health Market
*   2022: $375.2bn
*   2030: $532.9bn

### Our Addressable Market
*   **over 100** US teletherapy networks
*   **200-500** therapists per network
*   **~60 million** US adults who do therapy

### Note:
*   There are 200k therapists in the US alone

## Slide 9: Revenue Opportunities

Maximal patient context and operational efficiency gains that pay for themselves

### Revenue Generation:
We increase revenue for therapists by unlocking additional billing opportunities through CPT codes

*   **Remote Therapeutic Monitoring**
    *   98975 - Patient Set Up
    *   989X6 - Device Supply / Data Transmission
    *   98980/1 - Data Monitoring
*   **Collaborative Care Model**
    *   99492 - Initial month of CoCM
    *   99493 - Subsequent months of CoCM
    *   99494 - Add on code for 99492 + 99493

### Revenue Potential:
*   Up to an additional **$3,600 in revenue per year per patient**
*   **25-30% rev share** (referring to Oasys)
