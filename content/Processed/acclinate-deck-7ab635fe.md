## Slide 2: Mission

**Mission**

Acclinate is a trusted
digital health company
helping pharma access
and engage communities
of color so clinical trials
are more inclusive

ACCLINATE™

## Slide 3: Current State

**Current State**

Communities of color make up
42% of the U.S. population but
often represent less than 5% of
clinical trial participants

Without clinical trial diversity, we don't
know if new drugs work the same for
different populations – possible less
efficacy or negative side effects.

### Clinical Trial Participation Data

| Demographic             | % of U.S. Population (Source: U.S. Census) | % of Clinical Trial Participants   |
| :---------------------- | :----------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------- |
| Black or African Americans | 13.4%                                      | 5%                                 |
| Hispanic or Latino Origin | 18.1%                                      | 1%                                 |

## Slide 4: Problem

**Problem**

Pharma is ineffective in diversifying their clinical trials
because communities of color don't trust them

### % of Patients Enrolled in FDA Approved Cancer Drugs

| Year | White (%) | Black (%) | Hispanic (%) |
| :--- | :-------- | :-------- | :----------- |
| 2008 | 74        | 5         | 4            |
| 2009 | 74        | 5         | 5            |
| 2010 | 72        | 6         | 5            |
| 2011 | 74        | 4         | 4            |
| 2012 | 75        | 7         | 5            |
| 2013 | 74        | 5         | 6            |
| 2014 | 72        | 4         | 4            |
| 2015 | 71        | 7         | 5            |
| 2016 | 69        | 5         | 6            |
| 2017 | 69        | 4         | 4            |
| 2018 | 69        | 6         | 6            |

Communities of color are skeptical
of pharma and clinical trials due to
egregious past practices like the
Tuskegee experiment.

## Slide 6: Approach

**Approach**

We're effective in accessing and engaging communities of color
because they trust us with their health-related information

An Engaged Community
*   6,000+ community members
*   30% MoM community growth
*   40% engagement rate

*Image of "NOWINCLUDED" website showing navigation (About, Stories, Explore, Partners, Sign Up, Be Heard) and content sections (FEATURED, LATEST, Fatigue, Healthcare Profe).*

## Slide 7: Solution

**Solution**

e-DICT uses AI/ML to identify candidates from our
community most likely to participate in clinical trials

A Clear ROI for Pharma
*   Reduce recruitment time
*   Decrease recruitment cost
*   Increase retention
*   Adhere to FDA guidance on clinical trial diversity

*Image of "e-DICT" platform dashboard showing sections like My Dashboard (Overview, Trial Request, Reports, Scoring, Insights, Resources, Research, Account, My Account) and main content areas ("Good morning, Mr. Max," "My Campaign"). It shows "Search Community" and "Submit Request" buttons, and an "Mr Max" section with "Total Trials Submit" and "New Trials" indicators.*
