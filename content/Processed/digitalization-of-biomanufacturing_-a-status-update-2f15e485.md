Digitalization of bioprocessing is slowly bringing benefits to the biopharma industry.

Industry 4.0, conceptualized by the digitalization-led convergence of digital, physical, and virtual assets, brings a paradigm shift in the totality of
operations across the value chain. While many industries are already leveraging the value and benefits of digitalization in manufacturing
operations, the biopharmaceutical industries are slowly gearing up in this direction with an industry vision of Biopharma 4.0. Biomanufacturers
are investing heavily in building next-generation capabilities toward intensified, connected, and continuous manufacturing to remain competitive

Automation systems are reducing manual interventions for greater operational safety and less
risk of contamination. There are also opportunities for digitalization solutions related to quality,
data integrity, and regulatory compliance.

Irrespective of biomanufacturers' goals for operational efficiency and building the capability to
support next-generation bioprocessing, digitalization is inevitable. Digitalization is a key enabler
for such transformational capabilities in biomanufacturing; therefore, the adoption of automation
and digital technology is no more a choice but a necessity to remain competitive in the market.

### Many benefits of digitalization

Biopharma manufacturing presents enormous opportunities for benefit from thoughtful application of digitalization solutions, according to Matt
Panning, senior director of manufacturing at Humacyte. "Controlling product quality, reducing costs, and improving time to market are always
important factors in manufacturing. Biopharma manufacturing specträffyeån often involve small production runs for rare or personalized
medicines and/or highly complex processes that require tight controls to ensure product quality and acceptable yield. The costs associated with
more traditional infrastructure investment in capital and systems development, as well as the costs of not leveraging the data available from
manufacturing, are all very good targets for digitalization solutions," he observes.

"The benefits of digitalization in biopharma manufacturing are multidimensional across the value-chain of operations. They start with a holistic
view of plant operations, facilitating more eyes to control and monitor CPPs (critical process parameters) and CQAs (critical quality attributes)
and also include access to centralized contextualized data to gain valuable insights through advanced analytics, such as batch prediction
coupled with automated reporting from and across the batch. Real-time access to process data coupled with AI/ML [artificial
intelligence/machine learning] [to potentially] support batch release in real-time and significant time savings by minimizing error-prone, manual
tasks and enabling easier collaboration across the organization through digital workflows are additional positive impacts. Overall, digitalization
helps the organization to achieve operational excellence to meet the market demand on time, speed, quality, agility, and sustainability," adds Braj
Nandan Thakur, global product manager of process automation and analytics for MilliporeSigma, the Life Science business of Merck KGaA,
Darmstadt, Germany.

The potential benefits of such digitalization, says Cenk Undey, global head of data and digital for pharma technical development with Roche and
Genentech, a member of the Roche Group, include process optimization and continuous improvement to drive cost-of-goods-manufactured
(COGM) down and increase staff productivity and safety, while improving environmental sustainability. One of the first improvements, he notes,
is the removal of 'paper' from the manufacturing process, otherwise required as a system of record. "Digitalization of batch records, equipment-
use logs, and such are good examples that help reduce manual data transfers," he comments.

Operations that heavily utilize process automation are often easy to integrate and mine, but some operations that are often paper-based can be
more difficult, Panning remarks. He notes, however, that even some of the paper-based operations can be worth the investment to digitalize if
they lead to significant yield or quality improvements through better process understanding and analysis.

Improved process and product insights at a much lower cost result in better manufacturing processes with faster development timelines,
contends Jesse McCool, cofounder and CEO of Wheeler Bio, a new biologics contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO)
located in Oklahoma City focused on small-batch, agile drug substance manufacture. For instance, using data acquired in the past combined
with dozens of data parameters obtained in real time, it is possible to elaborate through cloud domains and AI which of those parameters can be
the best lead or process conditions to obtain a predefined response or target, according to Vincenza Pironti, senior pharma services R&D staff
scientist at Thermo Fisher Scientific. "These benefits are applicable for all steps of the process involving all the unit operations present in a
biopharma company," she says.

Digitalization can, overall, impact the very basic philosophy of the biopharma industry and that is access to life-saving therapy in a faster yet
compliant manner with proven quality at an affordable price. As a desired outcome of digitalization, while patient safety is of paramount interest,
operator safety and sustainability cannot be ignored, Thakur summarizes. "Real-time process monitoring can give insight into process
parameters and deviations and reduce the risk of oversight, non-compliance, and batch failures. Predictive analytics can anticipate process
deviations earlier and optimize operations to deliver consistent quality. Digitalization can also increase flexibility in biomanufacturing processes
by becoming more agile to reconfigure processes and respond to new modalities. Finally, implementing digitalization in biomanufacturing can
deliver the goal of faster, improved quality, more cost-effective, safe, and effective therapeutics to patients, irrespective of modalities or steps,"
he concludes.

### Upstream and downstream nuances

There are other factors that can impact the level of benefits realized through
digitalization. There may be process-specific nuances that differ between upstream
and downstream onerations Thakur observes "For avamnla" ha avnlains "if one

during which significant online data [are] generated along with the offline data for
the period of the run."

Digitalization can help here, Thakur comments, because it enables monitoring of
variability due to different sources—the genealogy of the raw materials used and
continuous reviews of the quality profile (such as the glycosylation profile and
charge distribution for antibodies) using advanced sensor technologies, process
data analytics capabilities, and advanced analytical models.

Another big difference between upstream and downstream is referred to as the
process time constant, such as in biologics drug substance manufacturing,
according to Undey. Downstream operations are much faster and end more quickly
—sometimes a phase lasts a minute versus weeks—for a process in a bioreactor. "In

addition, while the types of data collected are very similar, more types tend to be
evaluated for quality control (QC) samples obtained downstream for quality
attribute analysis for lot release compared to those for upstream in-process control
(IPC) samples collected for process performance variables," he says.

Upstream, there can be further differences in digitalization for batch/fed-batch
processes versus intensified processes performed in a smaller footprint. Integrated
continuous manufacturing (CM), meanwhile, requires fully connected data flows
between upstream and downstream operations (such as the harvest,
chromatography, and ultrafiltration/diafiltration steps) with surge tanks as well as
process analytical technology (PAT) sensors for ensuring process and product
quality control across the CM process operation, according to Undey.

scientists in the ML cycle where we design, test,
build, learn, and repeat, in an iterative fashion, to
create powerful, predictive models of our
biomanufacturing processes. The data wrangling is
perhaps the hardest part when implementing ML in
the lab and digitalization solutions are key [to]
reducing the manual steps in data processing," he
explains. The process is iterative in nature, so
according to McCool, digitalization tools are most
useful at this stage to keep costs down and expedite
insight building.

Drug development can also benefit from various
aspects of digitalization, such as lead definition
through the use of AI, according to Vincenza Pironti,
senior pharma services R&D staff scientist at
Thermo Fisher Scientific. She notes that
computational chemistry can be used as well to
broaden the pool of potential candidates and explore
non-standard landscapes, thus expanding pipelines.
"In summary, three values are widely acknowledged
as the major benefits of digitalization at early
development phases: high productivity, possible
timing reduction in drug discovery, and diversified
pipelines," Pironti concludes.

### Overcoming challenges

As with any major change in operational activities, there are hurdles that companies
must overcome when moving to digitalized bioprocessing. One of the first that must
be overcome is linked to natural human resistance to change. Steps that can be
taken to minimize this issue, says Pironti, include creating a new mindset inside the
organization to build necessary skills in the workforce and new roles for monitoring
the progress and the outcomes resulting from the introduction of digital tools.
Performance of gap and risk assessments should help identify specific needs and
enable development of appropriate action plans.

Another human challenge noted by McCool is found in the intellectual interface
between process scientists (subject matter experts) and data scientists (modeling
experts). "I think it is quite difficult for most data scientists to contextualize
bioprocess data without having a deep knowledge and tangible experience of the
real-world physical systems they are modeling. Therefore, it is crucial to have a very
good collaborative approach for model-based operations where process scientists
and data scientists work together on a regular basis. Additionally, this structure
needs executive sponsorship at the highest levels in the company for a disciplined
ML strategy to emerge and be sustained," he explains.

On the technical side, companies can find it challenging to select the right digital
technologies and integrate them into their ecosystems, according to Thakur. "An
existing facility comes with the challenge of integrating digital technologies into its
legacy systems and existing infrastructure, while a new facility can build a new
solution but faces the dilemma of choosing already-known technologies instead of
innovative ones to reduce the risk and complexities of validation," he says.

### New approaches to data analytics
software

Many vendors and tools exist today that make data
analysis of biopharma manufacturing data and
supply-chain metrics easier to understand more
quickly. One trend is the availability of scaled
licenses for software-as-a-service that allow minimal
investment up front and flexibility to adapt while also
giving manufacturers a robust package of tools that
meet the expectations of their patients, regulators,
and investors for delivery, cost, and quality,
according to Matt Panning, senior director of
manufacturing at Humacyte.

"While the heart of novel drug discovery and
development may always rely on human ingenuity at
its core, ensuring that therapeutics are produced
consistently and safely through the use of
digitalization services can be very advantageous,"
Panning contends. Process analytics software, web-
based ERP systems, and even off-the-shelf
production-scheduling software that makes it easier
to coordinate the myriad activities involved in current
good manufacturing practice (CGMP)-compliant

demonstrate value, the challenge remains in scaling up digital technologies to the wider enterprise. Last-but-not-least is the challenge of
articulating the value realized from investments in digital technologies," Thakur observes.

Lack of ubiquitous data standards across the industry, adds Undey, was confirmed by the domain experts from industry, academia, and suppliers
during the Integrated Continuous Biomanufacturing conference that took place in Sitges, Spain in October 2022. "Different manufacturing
technologies often have different data standards, and therefore, data integration requires further investment on the part of the biopharma
company. Additionally, manufacturing digital systems are typically not plug-n-play, so each time we introduce a new piece of equipment or
analyzer/sensor, effort is required to make its data integrated with the rest of the labs and plants," he says.

Lack of standardization raises other questions as well. Assuring data integrity can be challenging while digitalizing large amounts of data from
different sources and integrating them across multiple platforms. "Despite being an advantage overall, the use of multiple service providers who
each deliver and manage their own solutions to a manufacturer can present the manufacturer with a significant problem when it comes to
ensuring that all of the data maintains integrity across all of those platforms," Panning comments.

In addition to controlling primary data sources, there are issues around handling the impact of software updates on data validation.
"Manufacturers, not their service providers, are liable to understand and control their data collection, processing, and retention are maintained
when these routine updates happen. And when two or more of these services are linked, which is often the case when a manufacturer sets up
their own customized solutions, it makes keeping up with all of the changes as much more difficult," Panning explains. The rate of change
across the industry and regulatory agencies further heightens such concerns.

Accessing comprehensive data is another important issue facing biopharma companies looking to digitalize their manufacturing operations.
According to McCool, Michelle K. Lee, founder and CEO of Obsidian Strategies and former AWS and Google executive, remarked in a MLxBio5
conference in San Francisco on Oct. 21, 2022 that companies are really only using approximately 10% of the data that gets generated (1). "The
real work for any company looking for digital transformation is getting access to all the data being generated in their company," McCool
contends. In addition, he notes that more than half of the time spent developing ML models is spent wrangling, processing, and cleaning up data
—activities that are ripe for automation by smart middleware solutions.

Furthermore, the biopharma industry, McCool observes, is not yet data-rich like other industries, even for commercial production, let alone
clinical operations. "Bioprocesses are fraught with complexity, real-world processing interactions, and regulatory constraints that make
predictive modeling fundamentally challenging. When this truth is considered along with the fact that data points are very expensive in
bioprocessing ($6–$10 million for a Phase I manufacturing batch), it is obvious why data strategies currently remain limited," he states. He
reiterates that the solution, at least in part, is to have an accurate scaled-down model of bioprocesses coupled with automated workflows and
smart middleware that lowers the cost of collecting and analyzing data points.

### Current state of digitalization

The level of adoption of advanced digitalization in the biopharma sector is fairly low,
but that is changing. Most mid-to large size biopharma companies, says Undey,
digitalized batch records in the early to mid-2000s to remove, or significantly reduce,
paper records from manufacturing floor operations, although old paper-based
recordkeeping may still exist in various spots due to organic growth and investment
prioritization reasons. Process automation that integrates widely across a site and
use of data analytics to better understand and control processes is expected at this
point, according to Panning. He also notes that the use of service providers for
licensed software has exploded in the past decade or so.

Even so, Panning believes the industry is still grappling with how to apply more
traditional pharmaceutical models to the new models that are evolving today. In
addition, McCool believes that currently manufacturers are making do with 21st-
century digital tools and automation that are not sufficient. "To really penetrate into
the heart of what is going on with their systems and achieve deeper understanding
than is currently possible, process scientists need predictive modeling, digital twins,
and AI augmenting their abilities," he insists.

Full data integration across the plant is rare, Undey agrees. "A cross-industry forum
led by BioPhorum group has created a maturity model for biomanufacturing digital
plants to gauge the need and the level of digitalization and automation. The study
found that for most plants, 'connected plant with data integration' is sufficient, while
some fully autonomous/adaptive plants may make more sense to drive COGM

### Different approaches but some
common best practices

Different companies take various pathways toward
digitalization. Some focus efforts on new facilities,
building "digital plants" or at least digitalizing to the
fullest extent possible certain production suites.
Others seek to implement digital tools and
technologies within existing operations for legacy
products to gain experience and determine the level
of benefits that can be realized in practice before
expanding to wider adoption.

"Digital transformation is a journey that can occur in
various parts of an organization, across a
department, a site, or multiple sites globally, or with
suppliers and collaborators," Braj Nandan Thakur,
global product manager of process automation and
analytics for MilliporeSigma, the Life Science
business of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany
observes. "There is not a one-size-fits-all
implementation strategy, but there are some
common approaches to ensure that the journey to
digital transformation is successful," he says. First, it

companies, industry stakeholders, and regulatory agencies collaborateditment
accelerate the adoption of digital technologies for faster development and
manufacture of vaccines and therapeutics and to facilitate day-to-day operations,"
Thakur says.

As a result, today large biopharma companies look at digitalization as a
transformation lever that helps them keep the core knowledge, architecture, and
designs internally while working with strategic partners to execute the tactical
technology implementation, according to Thakur. Smaller firms, however, often
adopt digital capabilities that help them solve operational and compliance needs in
the short-medium term while giving them a competitive edge in terms of operational
efficiency, business intelligence, and customer collaborations so they can meet
aggressive timelines. Contract service providers leverage digitalization strategies
that afford them greater flexibility and scalability and the ability collaborate with
their customers and regulators.

The pandemic, adds Pironti, prompted an incredible acceleration in digitalization of
biomanufacturing—from lead selection to the generation of prediction modeling for
the manufacturing process, to prevention of possible deviations through monitoring
storage and distribution data. "These digital assets can be the starting point for
further implementation of digital tools," she observes.

Indeed, Undey underscores the fact that several companies have been making
steady progress with digitalization of their bioprocessing operations. Example
solutions he highlights include plantwide real-time process monitoring, predictive
maintenance of equipment, PAT, cobots for warehouse ops, various "Industry 4.0"
applications such as the Industrial Internet-of-things (IIoT), integrated
MES/ERP/laboratory information systems (LIMS), applications of AI and ML, and
advanced process control solutions. "The adoption of these technologies is driven
by their technological maturity and availability in the marketplace (with robust
suppliers), regulatory acceptance and experience, and ability to meet key business
needs," he states.

### Biopharma moving from adopter to pioneer

Digitalization is an exciting journey that continues to evolve within the biopharma
industry as manufacturers continue to improve performance and strive for greater
efficiency and quality, with the goal of meeting current and future patient needs.
"We should remember that digitalization of biomanufacturing is a means to that end
to help drive utmost efficiencies and COGM down, ensuring supply to patients,"
Undey emphasizes.

Areas within digitalization where further developments can be expected, according
to Undey, include further capabilities for remote monitoring and support
technologies and more advanced applications such as miniaturized wireless
sensors, machine-learning programs for predictive plant-performance management,
intelligent decision-support systems, and digital twins. "It is not a matter of if, but a
matter of when. We are excited to help create that future and embrace it to harness
the power of data and digital across the product-advancement value chain to better
serve our patients," he states.

Within change lie both opportunity and challenge, and that is true for digitalization
of biomanufacturing, Panning observes. "Digitalization has enormous potential for
our industry and will only continue to grow in its applications. Picking the right
solutions, at the right time, and following through with proper resourcing during the
change-management process are the keys to successful implementation," he
comments.

The adoption of digitalization in bioprocessing is, Thakur believes, happening at a
Advertisement
technology landscape is complex and may be
confusing; however, laying a robust foundation on
the digital journey considering current business
challenges and anticipated future challenges is key
to long-term success. Hence, it's recommended to
adopt a solution-centric phased approach that
minimizes the risk and maximizes the value,"
contends Thakur.

Deciding what areas to digitalize and for what
purpose and whether to digitalize end-to-end or if it
is necessary for the main objective is a first step,
according to Cenk Undey, global head of data and
digital for pharma technical development with Roche
and Genentech, a member of the Roche Group. Once
this is understood, data standardization and
technology platform selection (whether to invest in
data lakes and meshes, IIoT platforms, advanced
analytics, and visualization) are determined.
"Probably the most crucial aspects of the strategy
are establishing necessary processes and training
the workforce to sustain and enjoy digital plant
operation. This may involve upskilling the existing
workforce at all levels for digital literacy and hiring
new talent with advanced skills (like
data/computational/ML scientists as necessary),"
he notes.

Panning agrees that establishing some
fundamentals is important. That includes developing
a clear set of policies on data integrity, change
management, and supplier management (including
supply and quality agreements). "These tools will
make it easier for their organization to identify and
develop digitalization solutions in a more consistent
manner," he explains. Communication is equally
important, according to Panning, and all relevant
functional groups in a company should be kept in the
loop throughout implementation.

It is also critical, stresses Jesse McCool, cofounder
and CEO of Wheeler Bio, to use data that are
important for the company and to have a
comprehensive data management strategy that is
supported by the highest level of corporate
governance. "The ML model is only as good as the
data it is trained on, so having access to meaningful
data is absolutely essential," he states. That requires
developing a good strategy within which data are
viewed as an organizational asset and not a
departmental asset, thus ensuring that data are
democratized easily and securely so that they can be
leveraged for analytics and ML applications.

"Implementing digitalization strategies requires a
mindset and cultural shift and change across
business and operational models and organizational
structures & culture of innovation collaboration and

demand a lot more precision and accuracy from these digital technologies that other industries may not demand of them," he says.

The reason is simple, according to Thakur—biopharma touches lives like no other industry, and as the space of biologics starts rapidly evolving,
the demand for innovation and technology will also be unprecedented. "This pace cannot be met by biopharma manufacturing organizations
alone. Instead, it will require an ecosystem of technology companies, digital providers, manufacturers, regulators, governments, entrepreneurs,
and life-science leaders alike, who will come together to transform the way biopharma will evolve in the coming decade. A lot more is yet to
come, and this is just the beginning!"

in a deai nearly worth potentially up to $2 billion, Genentecn, a member of the kocne Group, nas
entered into a license agreement with Sangamo Therapeutics, a genomic medicine company, to
develop genomic medicines to treat certain neurodegenerative diseases. These medicines will be
administered intravenously. Genentech will license, on an exclusive basis, Sangamo's proprietary
zinc finger repressors directed to the tau gene and its neurotropic adeno-associated virus (AAV)
capsid, STAC-BBB, for tau and a second neurology target.

Under the agreement, Sangamo will be responsible for completing a technology transfer to
Genentech and will be responsible for certain preclinical activities. For its part, Genentech will be
responsible for all clinical development, regulatory interactions, manufacturing, and global
commercialization. Genentech expects to pay Sangamo $50 million in near-term upfront license fees and milestone payments. In addition,
Sangamo is eligible to receive up to $1.9 billion in development and commercial milestones. These milestone payments would be spread across
multiple potential products developed under the agreement. Sangamnissalen eligible to receive tiered royalties on net sales of any products
resulting from the collaboration, subject to certain specified reductions.

"Sangamo has been pioneering the field of genomic medicine for years to address devastating neurodegenerative diseases with limited current
treatment options," said Sandy Macrae, CEO, Sangamo, in the press release. "We strongly believe in the power of our zinc finger technology to
regulate the expression of key genes involved in disease. The recent discovery of our industry-leading intravenously delivered AAV capsid, STAC-
BBB, has the potential to address longstanding challenges in delivering therapeutics to the central nervous system. We are excited to share this
powerful combination with Genentech to advance potential treatment options for devastating neurodegenerative disorders, and we are hopeful
this could be the first of multiple capsid collaborations to come with other partners."

The tau gene is critically involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other tauopathies (1). Genentech's access to Sangamo's zinc finger repressors
will allow Genentech to develop genomic therapeutics against AD as well as an undisclosed second neurology target. Sangamo's STAC-BBB has
demonstrated potent blood-brain barrier penetration and brain transduction in nonhuman primates, the company said in the release.

"We are uniquely positioned with our collective experience, expertise, and resources in neurological research to explore transformative
approaches, including gene therapy, that treat neurodegenerative diseases," said Boris L. Zaïtra, head of Roche Corporate Business
Development, in the release. "Through groundbreaking research and partnerships with companies such as Sangamo, we are committed to
pursuing important breakthroughs in both early diagnosis and treatment. Our relentless pursuit of scientific innovation is taking us into areas of
enormous unmet medical need and progress in treating diseases of the brain and nervous system."
