## Summary
The FDA is providing clarity on promotional communications for biological reference products and biosimilars, establishing guidelines for how manufacturers can market and communicate about these complex pharmaceutical products. This guidance aims to standardize communication practices, potentially reducing regulatory uncertainty for biosimilar manufacturers and marketers.

## Startup Angle
A regulatory AI platform that uses natural language processing to auto-audit promotional materials for biosimilar manufacturers, instantly flagging potential FDA compliance issues before submission. First customers would be mid-sized biosimilar manufacturers seeking to streamline their regulatory review process and reduce legal/compliance risk, with pricing based on a per-document or annual subscription model. The product could leverage machine learning trained on FDA guidance to create a predictive compliance screening tool that didn't previously exist.
