The patient was seen by his neurologist on July 1, 2025, at which time he was noted to have visual hallucinations and worsening gait freezing. For his gait freezing, his Mirapex was increased by 0.125 mg every week to a goal dose of 0.75 mg t.i.d. He successfully up-titrated the medicine to 0.75/0.625/0.625 but began to have visual hallucinations and confusion, so on July 15, 2025, his neurologist recommended decreasing the dose to 0.625 TID. Despite the changes to his Mirapex, the patient's daughter has noted progressive gait stiffness and increased difficulty standing. This has resulted in difficulty with simply getting to the bathroom, leading to episodes of incontinence.
