The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) affirms its commitment to advancing interoperability and improving prior authorization processes with the publication of the CMS Interoperability and Prior Authorization final rule (CMS-0057-F). Through the provisions in this final rule, Medicare Advantage (MA) organizations, state Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) Fee-for-Service (FFS) programs, Medicaid managed care plans, CHIP managed care entities, and Qualified Health Plan (QHP) issuers on the Federally Facilitated Exchanges (FFEs), (collectively "impacted payers") are required to implement and maintain certain Health Level 7® (HL7®) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources® (FHIR®) application programming interfaces (APIs) to improve the electronic exchange of health care data as well as to streamline prior authorization processes To encourage providers

**For payers**
*   Ensure quick decision making and faster turnaround time
*   Transparency to patients directly impacts star ratings
*   Implement APIs for seamless data exchange

**How does it benefit providers**
*   Leverage electronic prior authorization to reduce admin overhead and cost
*   Redirect staff to more patient focussed activities

**How does it benefit patients**
*   Timely care delivery
*   Access to real time information, impacting their health

**RISA Uses AI for Prior Authorization to Create Billion-Dollar Healthcare Savings**
JANUARY 17, 2024
Image shows Rishabh Sahu, Kumar Shivang, Kshitij Jaggi.
**RISA**, envisioned by serial entrepreneurs who scaled Urban Health, a mental wellness and sleep platform to over a million users, now targets the heart of healthcare's inefficiency. Kshitij Jaggi, Founder and CEO, recounts the thought behind this vision, "The healthcare system is at a breaking point. With a staggering $950 billion funnelled into administrative costs and $265 billion of that lost to inefficiencies as reported by McKinsey, our focus was clear: we needed to rebuild and innovate."

Having successfully scaled Urban Health, a mental wellness and sleep platform, to **1M+ users** in the US and globally, and raising **$3.4M in funding**, we are now channeling our deep health-tech context into RISA. In mid 2023, we shifted to Palo Alto (on O-1 visa) to found RISA with a mission to address **administrative inefficiencies in healthcare**, making it more intelligent, responsive, and patient-centric systems
