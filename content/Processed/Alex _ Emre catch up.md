### Company Background & Pivot

- 2nd time founder, initially naive to healthcare
- Fell into trap of not being ambitious enough
- Previously built SaaS for patient ad campaigns - messaged 1000s of patients, helped get Annual Wellness Visits (AWVs)
- Slammed the brakes in November after realizing limited impact
- Pivoted to focus on actual patient care improvement
- Launched new solution in May with IPA in Southern California

### Core Product & Value Proposition

- Focus on patient journey between outpatient clinics for referrals
- Avoiding “agentic automation” that dominates market attention
- Argues front-desk automation will be featurized in every package
- No long-term value in just replacing front-desk staff
- May make care worse by layering onto fragmented systems
- Achieving 75% patient engagement (10x improvement from mass texts)
- 1 in 3 referrals has interoffice issues needing resolution

### Market Opportunity

- 1 in 10 inpatient dollars spent on preventable hospitalizations
- Targeting conditions like pneumonia or diabetes complications
- Focus on Ambulatory Care Sensitive Conditions (ACSC)
- Creating strategic value through:
	- Trusted relationship with patients
	- High fidelity outreach data
	- Better data on care navigation (e.g., how many rings for specific staff to answer)
- Targeting fragmented markets vs integrated health systems

### Provider Integration

- No EHR integration required
- Primary care clinics send all referrals via fax
- Free tool for providers
- Handles all types of referrals (DME, radiology, dermatology, PT, home services)
- Solving for:
	- Patient experience improvement
	- Inbox fatigue reduction (large % of messages relate to referral navigation)
	- Care coordination in fragmented systems

### Current Status & Fundraising

- Raised $500K from MedMountain Ventures and Opal Ventures
- Launched in May 2025
- Currently at 113 referrals
- 100% focused on driving adoption of free tool
- Building care navigation capabilities to help risk-bearing organizations
- Not actively fundraising - focused on 30-60 day window to build convincing data

### Personal Notes

- Located in San Diego
- Team includes multiple “girl dads” driving family-friendly culture
- 5PM hard stop for team dinner time
- Working with design partner IPA in Southern California
