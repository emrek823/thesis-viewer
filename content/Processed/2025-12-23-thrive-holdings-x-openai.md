We are excited to partner with OpenAI to accelerate our mission by bringing frontier AI into foundational parts of the economy.

Holdings currently operates in the accounting and IT services sectors, vast industries that produce hundreds of billions of revenue each year but still run on workflows that have barely changed in decades. Much of the work remains manual and scattered across disconnected systems, creating inconsistent customer experiences and needless complexity for employees.

These functions are a natural place to begin, but they are only the start. Many traditional industries that support the real economy share similar characteristics: high-volume processes, aging operational infrastructure, and teams relegated to repetitive, low-leverage work. Our goal is to transform these sectors from the inside out and improve how employees work and the quality of service customers receive.

The partnership will bring together a unique, cross-functional team, comprising OpenAI’s leading research and applied AI teams working alongside engineers, operators, and industry experts at Holdings to deeply integrate AI into the businesses that we own and operate. OpenAI will become an owner in Holdings as a result of this partnership, which we believe will align incentives for long-term value creation.  
  
We believe the most powerful applications of AI will emerge from creating tight feedback loops between research, product, and engineering teams, in lock step with domain experts within businesses. By training the most advanced models for specific tasks within our businesses, guided by both company-specific data and expert feedback, we believe we can continuously improve model capabilities and ultimately establish AI as an integral driver of long-term enterprise value.  
  
We view OpenAI as a partner to both our technology strategy and long-term mission. We are excited to continue building together.
