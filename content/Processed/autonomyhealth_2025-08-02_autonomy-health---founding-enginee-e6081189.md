# Who We Are
In a world where physicians are losing autonomy, we're on a mission to bring it back.

Hospital and private equity consolidation has reshaped healthcare. It has resulted in higher costs, less competition and worse patient outcomes. Better care starts with physician ownership and giving doctors the tools to stay independent.

At Autonomy Health, we're transforming how neurology practices operate, combining AI, software, and human expertise to streamline fragmented workflows into a unified, intelligent operating system. Most neurologists want to grow but are limited by staffing and legacy tech stacks. Our platform helps practices scale, add new service lines, and deliver more integrated care to their patients.

We're a small but mighty team building with urgency and a deep respect for the physicians we serve. We've raised capital, our customers love us, and we have a clear product roadmap. Over $100bn is coming into neurology in the next five years. Join us to help independent neurologists unlock it and build the future of neurological care together!

# What You'll Do
As a Founding Engineer, you'll report directly to the founders and likely spend 75% of your time building and 25% of your time with customers. This role is going to be engineering-first with significant exposure to product ownership and sales.

*   Design, build, and maintain scalable workflows for referrals, scheduling, patient intake, prior authorizations, billing, and care management
*   Architect the technical foundation: decide what to build in-house vs. buy, integrating best-in-class tools and proprietary software into a unified platform
*   Develop and maintain data infrastructure to turn clinical and operational data into actionable insights for decision-making
*   Work onsite with customers to iterate on the platform and rapidly implement improvements based on real-world feedback
*   Lay the leadership groundwork by defining the standards, setting the culture and helping hire and mentor future engineering hires
*   Tech Stack: Frontend/Backend (Javascript, Typescript, React), Data (Python, SQL), AWS

# Who's a Good Fit

*   You thrive in early stage environments. We're moving incredibly fast and operate with high intensity. We need builders who can embrace ambiguity, are high agency with a bias to ship and know how to build hard things that scale
*   You are curious and ask thoughtful questions. We question everything. Most constraints are human-made so the first question to ask is, why not? We're non consensus and our ability to succeed hinges on people seeing things that others don't
*   You are an owner. We want folks who are self-directed, obsessive and optimistic, the move the world by force of will types
*   You lead with empathy and humility. You aim to win, but you're invested in helping your team and customers succeed alongside you
*   You care about doing the right thing. Nothing matters more than this. Every decision we make hinges on two questions: does this help the patient and does this help the doctor?

# What to Expect

*   Fully in-person in New York City
*   High ownership, high trust and high standards
*   Intense but rewarding work and rapid pace — expect your impact to be meaningful and immediately felt
*   Flat leadership, transparent, and supportive culture—candor, care, and collaboration are the norm

# How You'll Grow

*   Everyone has a voice, and your ideas matter, regardless of seniority
*   We think of product development as a series of experiments so we'll have internal hackathons and you, your own side projects, to test potential new features
*   Rapid opportunities for growth, more responsibility, and continuous learning
*   Our aspiration: This is a place you proudly call home for the next decade. If you leave, it's one of two reasons:
    *   To start your own company (and we seed you!)
    *   Failed to hit the high bar we've set for ourselves

# The Other Fun Details

*   Fully paid health, dental and vision insurance
*   Generous matching contributions to employee FSA/HSA
*   401(k) with matching contributions
*   Two-week company-wide winter break, plus additional paid time off
