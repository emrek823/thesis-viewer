## Slide 1: Initial Research Summary
*   ~$100B post-acute care market continues to shift away from SNFs, and recent Medicare reimbursement changes ("biggest Medicare overhaul in 20 years") are an attempt to drive industry towards value
*   Value-based care programs often exclude SNFs and/or make it difficult to reap rewards from cost/performance improvements
*   Medicaid, the primary payer for nursing homes and long-term support and services (LTSS), is increasingly moving towards managed care to control costs and increase care coordination
*   Health insurers continue to vertically integrate and acquire/build/partner in the post-acute space. Some large players still lack a strong PAC service offering.
*   Increased tech adoption and recent interoperability rules create opportunities for novel software and data platforms in a PAC environment with highly variable care
    *   Improve discharge planning and expand beyond IMPACT Act
    *   Embed connectivity to control DME spend and improve quality

## Slide 7: Recent changes to SNF and Home Health Reimbursement are the "biggest Medicare overhaul in 20 years"
*   Home Health Care - Patient-driven groupings model (PDGM)
*   SNF - Patient-driven payments model (PDPM)

## Slide 8: PDGM aims to reduce volume-based reimbursement and form tighter integrations with hospitals and SNFs
### Prospective Payment System (PPS) vs. Patient Driven Groupings Model (PDGM)
| Feature | PPS | PDGM |
| :------------------------------ | :-------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Episode Duration | One 60-day episode | One to two 30-day episodes of care |
| Case Mix Weight and Payment Groupings | 153 payment groupings | 432 payment groupings, with referral source having an impact on agency reimbursement |
| Visit Threshold to Avoid a LUPA | 4 visit minimum during 60 day episode | 2-6 visits required within first 30 days of care plan, dependent on case severity. Potential for 2 separate LUPAS |
| Core Documentation | 1 OASIS, 1 claim, 1 RAPS Submissions | 1 OASIS, 1 or 2 claims, 1 or 2 RAPS submissions (depending on number of periods in the 60-day episode) |

Copyright © 2009 TripleTree Holdings, LLC.

*   Removes effect of therapy visits on payment changes
*   Replaces 60-day episode with 30-day episodes
*   Increases payment for medically complex admissions

## Slide 9: PDPM payment is determined by patient characteristics rather than relying on service use
### Two Different Patients: Same RUG, Different PDPM Rate
| Patient Characteristics | Patient A | Patient B |
| :---------------------- | :-------- | :-------- |
| Rehabilitation Received | Yes | Yes |
| Therapy Minutes | 730 | 730 |
| Extensive Services | No | No |
| ADL Score | 9 | 9 |
| Clinical Category | Acute Neurologic | Major Joint Replacement |
| PT & OT Functional Score | 10 | 10 |
| Nursing Function Score | 7 | 7 |
| Cognitive Impairment | Moderate | Intact |
| Swallowing Disorder | No | No |
| Mechanically Altered Diet | Yes | No |
| SLP Comorbidity | No | No |
| Comorbidities | IV Medication & Diabetes | Chronic Pancreatitis |
| Other Conditions | Dialysis | Septicemia |
| Depression | No | Yes |

*   RUGs: Both patients paid at Rehab Ultra = $616
*   PDPM: Patient A = $708; Patient B = $534

*   LOS adjustment rewards shorter stays
*   5-day assessment initially drives patient classification into different categories

## Slide 10: VBC in Post-Acute Care
VBC in Post-Acute Care

## Slide 11: Current SNF-focused VBC models are pay-for-performance. SNFs are often left out of many other value-based care programs looking to reduce PAC utilization
### FIGURE 2 Payment Models with Incentives and Accountability for Skilled Nursing Facilities
**EPISODE BASED PAYMENTS**
*   Involves SNF's through preferred networks or collaboratives to address coordination and quality issues.
*   SNF is not frequently a formal model participant

**Partnerships with Organizations in VBP Models** (Connecting SNF to Accountable Care Organizations)

**ACCOUNTABLE CARE ORGANIZATIONS**
*   Involves SNF's through preferred networks or collaboratives to address coordination and quality issues.
*   SNF is not frequently a formal model participant

**MEDICAID VBP FOR NURSING HOMES**
*   State-based P4P programs with financial rewards (e.g., bonus payments) tied to performance measures benchmarks

**VBP Models Directly Focused on SNFs** (Connecting SNF to Medicaid VBP and Medicare SNF VBP)

**Other Risk-Bearing Arrangements** (Connecting SNF to Institutional Special Needs Plans)

**MEDICARE SNF VBP PROGRAM**
*   SNFs can earn back portion of a 2% quality withhold with adequate performance on a hospital readmissions performance measure

**INSTITUTIONAL SPECIAL NEEDS PLANS (I-SNPs)**
*   Some provider-led plans provide PMPM to facilities; Payments can be used to finance poorly resourced services (e.g., telehealth)

*   ACOs generate savings by reducing SNF LOS or cutting SNFs out entirely
*   SNFs can participate in BPCI advanced, but can not bear risk
*   SNF value-based purchasing program (2019) only affects payment +/- 2%
*   SNF Quality reporting program (QRP) ties payment to data REPORTING only, not quality of that data

## Slide 12: Improving Medicare Post-Acute Care Transformation (IMPACT) Act states hospitals must use quality measures to help patients choose PAC facility
### Timeline of Major Deliverables in IMPACT Act of 2014
*   **2014-2016:** Standardized quality & resource use measure reporting for PAC providers begins
*   **2017:** Use of quality data to inform discharge planning
*   **2018:** Standardized assessment data required for PAC providers begins
*   **2019:** (No specific event indicated, but part of continuum)
*   **2020:** CMS & MedPAC reports on PAC prospective payment
*   **2021:** Study on hospital assessment data
*   **2022:** (No specific event indicated, but part of continuum)

Overall goals include:
*   Standardized patient assessment data that is uniform and comparable across post-acute care settings
*   Improved access and reporting
*   Creating the infrastructure for future payment reforms

## Slide 13: BPCI-A program (2019) raises the bar for providers and requires better clinical/operational performance to generate savings
### BPCI vs. BPCI-Advanced
| Feature | BPCI | BPCI-Advanced |
| :---------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------ |
| Bundle Period | 30, 60, or 90 day | 90 day only |
| Episodes covered | 48 inpatient | 29 inpatient and 3 outpatient |
| Types of entities that can initiate / "own" bundle | Acute Care Hospitals, Physician Groups, Skilled Nursing Facilities, Long Term Care Hospitals, Inpatient Rehab Facilities, Home Health Agencies | Acute Care Hospitals or Physician Group Practices |
| Advanced APM? | X | ✓ |
| Risk adjustment of target price | X | ✓ |
| Timing of risk | Phased in | Payments at risk from day 1 |
| Reconciliation process | Quarterly; optional reconciliation across episode types | Semi-annual; mandatory reconciliation across episode types |
| CMS discounts | 2% (Model 2) | 3% |
| Payment linked to quality measures | X | ✓ |
| Number and type of quality measures | Variable; proposed by individual participants and agreed on with CMS | Two universal measures (readmissions & advanced care planning) plus multiple episode specific quality measures |

### Additional key features of BPCI-Advanced
*   Exclusions only for specific MS-DRGs (no clinician input)
*   Attribution based on hierarchy: Attending physician group > Operating physician group > hospitals
*   Includes 3% CMS discount
*   Continues BPCI Medicare Benefit enhancements / Incentives: 3-Day Stay SNF rule, Telehealth, Post-Discharge Home Visit, and Beneficiary Incentives Waivers
*   Co-participation in ACOs and Oncology Care Model (but not CJR) is allowed for hospitals and clinicians

*   BPCI is a ~$15B program
*   Signify Health controls >50% program spend
*   Only hospitals and physician group practices can initiate or own bundle under BPCI-A

## Slide 14: Many question whether BPCI actually saves money beyond orthopedic bundles - the most popular clinical episode in old model
### Figure 1: Major joint replacements of lower extremity (hips/knees) was the only clinical group that achieved statistically significant Medicare savings per episode in BPCI Model 2

## Slide 25: Wide variation in PAC site utilization across geographies provides opportunity for standardization
### VARIATION IN SNF UTILIZATION (Map)
*Map shows states in shades of orange, indicating varying SNF utilization. States like Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, and parts of Florida show higher utilization (darker orange).*

Note: Utilization based on average Medicare FFS SNF use per beneficiary in each state.

### MARKET COMPARISON OF PAC SITE USE AND MEDICARE SPEND PER BENEFICIARY, 2015
**% of Total PAC Placement**
| Market | IP Rehab | SNF | Home Health | CHF | COPD | Stroke (Hemorrhagic and Ischemic) | Diabetes Mellitus | Dementia and Cognitive Disorders |
| :------- | :------- | :-- | :---------- | :-- | :--- | :------------------------------- | :---------------- | :------------------------------- |
| HOUSTON | 8% | 28% | 84% | $4,813 | $4,125 | $12,417 | $4,207 | $9,816 |
| MINNEAPOLIS | 1% | 55% | 71% | $4,480 | $4,032 | $9,219 | $3,877 | $4,995 |

*   Indicative of payer impact on placement patterns, 19% of Houston stroke patients are referred to IRFs vs only 3% in more managed Minneapolis.
*   Total PAC spend per beneficiary is almost one-third higher in Houston than Minneapolis. In SNFs alone, Minneapolis spends 44% less per beneficiary, likely due to lower LOS and more appropriate placement.

### BPCI Model 2 Program with Dignity Health: Realizing Value-Based Care Improvements
Dignity Health and naviHealth, now entering their fifth year in partnership with hospitals, physicians and PAC facilities under BPCI, have achieved positive results, which include:

*   A 40% reduction in IRF utilization without a noted increase in 30- and 90-day readmission rates
*   A 56% reduction in LTCH utilization
*   An 8% reduction in SNF utilization
*   A 12% increase in Home Health utilization
*   An 8% reduction in 90-day readmissions
*   A decrease in SNF overall average length of stay by 3.4 days, with no compromise in functional outcomes, community discharge or 30-day readmissions. This same trend remains true when severity-adjusted for admission function, medical complexity, and impairment group (based on primary diagnosis). Moreover, orthopedics, one of the largest diagnostic-related groups for Dignity Health, demonstrated an overall average reduction in length of stay by 3.6 days, with no compromise in functional outcomes, community discharge, or 30-day readmissions, which holds constant with severity adjustment
*   Dignity Health and naviHealth have accrued year-over-year savings in the BPCI Model 2 program

## Slide 44: If the overall goal is to reduce readmissions and move patients to lower cost sites of care, how are we defining post-acute care solutions for Basis?
### Defining Long-Term and Post-Acute Care
**Post-Acute Care**
Range of medical services that support an individual's continued recovery from illness or management of a chronic illness
*   **Medical care includes:**
    *   Home health
    *   Skilled nursing
    *   Inpatient/Outpatient Rehab
    *   Long-term acute care
    *   Hospice/palliative care
*   Medicare is the primary payer, but Medicaid and commercial insurers pay too

**Long-Term Care**
Range of services and supports an individual needs to meet personal care and daily routine needs
*   **Mostly non-medical assistance with:**
    *   Activities of daily living (bathing, dressing, etc.)
    *   Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (Housework, personal finances, groceries, etc.)
*   Medicaid is the primary payer, however majority is provided by informal caregivers

**Often provided side-by-side either at home or in institutions**
PAC is provided for discrete time periods with medical treatment as the main goal; Long-Term Care is provided on an ongoing basis focused on helping patients cope with disease in their daily lives

## Slide 45: Elderly and disabled make up <25% of enrollment but account for ~55% of the spending.

## Slide 49: Duals: UHC is utilizing naviHealth for post-acute care management for its D-SNP plans after acquisition by Optum.
Beginning Aug. 1, 2021, naviHealth will start managing post-acute care for UnitedHealthcare® Medicare Advantage members in Alabama, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Tennessee and Vermont. This is in addition to the post-acute care management change that went into effect for certain states on April 1 and June 1, 2021.

This includes prior authorization, concurrent (continued stay) review and discharge planning for members transitioning to and receiving skilled care in:
*   Skilled nursing facilities (SNFs)
*   Acute Inpatient Rehab (AIR)
*   Long-Term Acute Care (LTAC)

Plans included:
*   Medicare Advantage Plans previously managed by UnitedHealthcare
*   Dual Eligible Special Needs Plans (DSNP)
*   Chronic Special Needs Plans (CSNP)
*   The Medicare component of the Tennessee Dual Complete One (FIDE) Plan

Plans not included:
*   UnitedHealthcare Institutional Special Needs Plans (ISNP)
*   UnitedHealthcare Institutional-Equivalent Special Needs Plans (IE-SNP)
*   Any Medicare Advantage members included in a delegated risk agreement to provider medical groups (e.g., Optum Care Network)
*   UnitedHealthcare commercial plans
*   UnitedHealthcare Community Plans (Medicaid Only Plans)
*   Long-Term Support Services (LTSS)
*   The Medicaid component of the Tennessee Dual Complete One (FIDE) Plan
*   The Massachusetts Senior Care Options (MASCO) Plan

## Slide 50: Duals: Medicare-Medicaid integrated programs allow health plans to capture savings on the medical side from investments in LTSS.
### Massachusetts Success
**PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND QUALIFYING AGE GROUP**
*   **PACE:** PACE organizations provide or coordinate access to comprehensive medical and support services for people age 55 and older who meet the criteria for receiving a nursing facility level of care in their home or community. Most PACE enrollees are dually eligible; however, some are members of either MassHealth or Medicare. Individuals without either MassHealth or Medicare can join PACE at their own expense.
*   **SCO:** SCO plans offer members age 65 and older comprehensive Medicare and MassHealth services, as well as additional behavioral health diversionary services, dental and vision care, and community-based supports. Most SCO members are dually eligible; however, some are members of MassHealth but not Medicare.
*   **ONE CARE:** One Care provides dual eligible members ages 21-64 at the time of enrollment with comprehensive Medicare and MassHealth services, as well as additional behavioral health diversionary services, dental and vision care, and community support services.

*   **PACE:** A national PACE study found that on average, states spend 13% less on caring for their PACE populations than they do on comparable Medicaid populations, and PACE members have a 24% lower hospitalization rate than dual eligible Medicaid members receiving nursing home services
*   **SCO:** A recent Massachusetts SCO evaluation showed a positive impact on service utilization and outcomes, with a 12% reduction in the number of nursing facility residency months and a 17% reduction in the risk of death among the SCO study population compared with a control cohort covered by the traditional, separate fee-for-service (FFS) Medicaid and Medicare programs.
*   **One Care:** Reported a reduction in inpatient admissions and emergency department utilization among members continuously enrolled for 12 months compared with those only enrolled for six months, as well as a reduction in inpatient admissions for members with severe disabilities

## Slide 59: Dual-eligibles:
Payers are focusing on Medicare, Medicaid, and dual eligibles as top strategic priorities and are enhancing their capabilities to serve these chronic populations. Comprehensive care coordination and in-home health services companies improve payers' abilities to effectively manage these populations and have become highly desirable assets in the marketplace. Examples of 2013 payer acquisitions of post-acute providers and stration was enabled by the CMS Innovations (CMMI) initiative ding acute, behavioral and LTSS services, through a single programs have historically operated under bifurcated and disparate nstration, including Ohio, and may take either a managed care or services. Ohio opted for the managed care model of coordination wal to participate in the demonstration in 2012 and was the first il the end of 2019. Despite being a voluntary program, the MyCare est enrollment of the 11 dual demonstration projects in the g.

### TABLE 1 Examples of Replicated Models of Integrated Care
| Program Model | Description | Findings |
| :------------ | :---------- | :------- |
| GRACE/HealthCare Partners 11,12 | The Geriatric Resources for Assessment and Care of Elders (GRACE) program provides continuous care management and coordination of care across multiple providers and settings and is targeted to low-income seniors with multiple chronic conditions. It focuses on optimizing health and functional status, decreasing excess health care use, and preventing nursing home placement. GRACE uses a nurse practitioner and a social worker who perform an in-home assessment to create individualized plan of care with the larger GRACE team consisting of a geriatrician, pharmacist, physical therapist, mental health social worker and a community-based services liaison. This model was disseminated and evaluated in homebound Medicare beneficiaries age 70 and older who receive medical care by HealthCare Partners Medical Group in Southern California. Over a 6-month period, the GRACE model was implemented for 174 homebound patients. | **Service Utilization:** In the HealthCare Partners dissemination, emergency department use declined 22 percent and hospital admissions declined 34 percent in the 12 months post-implementation. **Patient Satisfaction:** Over 90 percent of survey respondents agreed that GRACE increased overall patient satisfaction and quality of life, and was very helpful in providing comprehensive person-centered care to older patients. |

## Slide 60: MLTSS: successes
In a report issued by Milliman, which evaluated the cost impact of managed care in Texas as compared to FFS, data showed that Texas' MLTSS program created cumulative savings of $172M from 2010-2015, an average annual savings of 3.7%.iv Furthermore, a report issued by Texas Association of Health plans found that Texas's MLTSS program reduced hospitalization and emergency room use by 28 and 40 percent respectively and resulted in a 70 percent increase in the use of community-based services.v

## Slide 71: Lessons learned / Gaps
### Lessons learned
*   Building SNF/home health network or geographic density with mobile providers is key for growth
*   Technology advantage can drive initial advantage
*   Early wins compound in risk-based models

### Gaps
*   Post 60 or 90 days
*   Behavioral

## Slide 72: Opportunities
Low-hanging fruit for all - push to high quality SNFs and make simplify payment
*   Dual-eligibles - integrated care; underpenetrated
*   Medicaid only disability with chronic conditions - comorbid conditions have a big impact
*   Medically complex children - majority of spend in hospital
*   NICU and maternity care - NICU
*   SMI

### Exhibit 3. Distribution of Beneficiaries and Expenditures for Medicaid-only Beneficiaries with Disabilities, by Number of CDPS Categories, 2002
*Stacked Bar Chart Data (approximate from visual):*
| CDPS Categories | Beneficiaries (%) | Expenditures (%) |
| :-------------- | :---------------- | :--------------- |
| 0-1 | ~22% | ~5% |
| 2 | ~18% | ~8% |
| 3 | ~15% | ~12% |
| 4 | ~12% | ~15% |
| 5 | ~9% | ~15% |
| 6 | ~8% | ~15% |
| 7+ | ~15% | ~30% |

*Simplified overview from chart labels:*
*   Beneficiaries: 35% have 0-3 CDPS categories, 66% have 4+
*   Expenditures: 45% for 0-3 CDPS categories, 75% for 4+ (This seems inconsistent with the visual representation which suggests higher % of expenditure in 7+ categories, the text in the image is probably referring to a different grouping). Re-interpreting from visual: roughly 35% of beneficiaries are in 0-3 categories, accounting for around 45% of expenditures. 66% of beneficiaries are in 4+ categories, accounting for roughly 75% of expenditures.
