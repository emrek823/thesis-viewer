# Latent AI - Director, 340B Program at Mount Sinai Health System

**Interview conducted on August 20, 2025**

## Topics
- Prior Authorization
- 340B Program
- Specialty Pharmacy
- 340B Optimization
- Pharmacy AI
- AI capabilities
- Epic EMR
- 340B Services

## Summary
During the conversation, the senior director for 340B at a health system discussed the evaluation of pharmacy AI tools, focusing on Latent and Plenful. Latent was chosen for prior auth assistance in specialty pharmacy, while external accelerators like Shields were considered for other pharmacy services. The health system decided not to engage with Latent's 340B optimization services as they have a robust self-built system and may be more sophisticated in 340B operations compared to others in the industry.

## Client
Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today about the pharmacy AI space. To start off, could you please give us a quick overview of your scope and especially as it relates to these tools like Latent and Plenful, or Tandem and Mandolin or whichever ones you evaluated.

## Expert
Yes. It's just the first two. I'm not familiar with the others. I am the senior director for 340B for the health system, really everything that 340B touches. We've got a number of hospitals, we have a specialty pharmacy, number of retail pharmacies, everything. Latent, we, I believe, are in contract with and Plenful, which I've been a process of the evaluation process for both of those.

## Client
For Latent in general, what's the catalyst for you guys to start looking at these tools? What's the pain point that you're trying to solve?

## Expert
I think the main thing for them and what we're contracted on with them is for prior auth assistance. That's mainly out of the specialty pharmacy. We have been using external accelerators, but for doing a lot of the specialty pharmacy and pharmacy fulfillment services that are doing the prior auths in addition to our own employees. That really was the main service that they provide.

There's all the other 340B services that we evaluated, and we can get into that, but for Latent their AI capabilities, the way that they're able to leverage within Epic EMR, that's really the main thing I think that we are excited about leveraging and why we are in contract with them to help us on the prior auth side.

## Client
Just to be clear, you were involved in the Latent RFP and evaluation process?

## Expert
Yes. They offer a number of other services too. That really is I think the main one. They showed us their whole suite of everything else and what they do with 340B. We are not engaged. I'm sure they would like for us to do a lot of the other things that they offer in 340B, and I can talk about that.

Essentially, the long story short is they weren't offering anything that I thought was going to be that much of a value-add that we're not already doing or doing better ourselves. We have a pretty robust program, but in terms of optimization and everything else, that's not the main thing that we're engaged with them.

## Client
In terms of the external accelerators, you're talking about for prior auth, that's the first time I'm hearing about that class of companies. What kind of company is that that you were using? Is it a good service?

## Expert
No, it's not just that. Are you familiar with Shields at all? Have you heard of them?

## Client
I have not, no.

## Expert
Shields, they're not just that. Shields, how to describe them, they are a company that specializes in standing up hospital pharmacy, whether it's specialty pharmacy, in particular, where there's the most dollars. What they do is they provide a whole number of services, but it's essentially workforce.

They come with expertise in terms of payer contracting and fulfillment, but also all their liaisons that work in the clinics that help to manage the referrals that come into the pharmacy. One of the many other things that they offer is prior authorization assistance that we can outsource to them.

When someone calls our pharmacy, it's actually Shields employee that's working for us that is doing prior auth assistance, patient services, counseling. I didn't mean to say that's all that they do, but that's certainly a big part of what they do.

## Client
You guys evaluate any other providers for prior auth alongside Latent, or just Latent and Plenful, it sounds like?

**Client**
When was the RFP process? When did you get into contract with Latent?

**Expert**
Relatively recently a couple months ago.

**Client**
Is Latent live yet? Has the integration with Epic complete? Is it live for prior auth?

**Expert**
I don't believe so, no. I think they're still in the initial phases.

**Client**
What were the key criteria you guys were thinking about as you were evaluating Latent?

**Expert**
Speaking just specifically to prior auth, the sheer metrics that they promised in terms of number of prior auths they were able to perform, the turnaround time, and those kinds of things. There were other services that they offered. I can speak specifically to the 340B ones in terms of optimization and everything else, but that wasn't something that I felt was going to be a value-add to us.

**Client**
What is their 340B offering and why did you decide to not go with it?

**Expert**

Health systems like ours, or I assume, there's 340B eligible prescriptions, and there are ineligible prescriptions. A lot of what these companies try to do is optimize. They want to make sure that you're not missing any opportunity for qualifying prescriptions to 340Bs that might be falling through the cracks. They wanted to leverage some of their own AI, Epic integrated tools to go after this leakage.

We have a very robust self-built system that review process for both optimization and compliance. We're not only qualifying additional prescriptions, but we're also disqualifying prescriptions that should not have qualified. It's all geared around that optimization piece.

**Client**
Do you think for a less sophisticated or less built out health system, that 340B offering from Latent would actually be quite helpful or do you think your system is a little bit ahead of what maybe the average is across the industry?

**Expert**
I would probably say so. We have people doing 340B, which is probably not typical for a 340B program.

**Client**
Okay. Thank you again for taking the time to speak with us today. This was very helpful. Enjoy the rest of your day.
