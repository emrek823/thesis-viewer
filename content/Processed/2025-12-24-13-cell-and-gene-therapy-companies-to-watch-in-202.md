#### Overview

A look at 13 startups and public companies advancing genetic medicines, cell-based therapies, and next-generation treatment platforms.

Gene and cell therapies are becoming core tools for treating cancer, rare diseases, autoimmune conditions, and degenerative disorders, with a growing number of products now reaching patients. The main question facing the field is no longer whether these approaches can work, but how to scale them, manufacture them reliably, and deploy them in ways that are both clinically and economically viable.

“What excites me is the breadth of tools now in play, from traditional AAV and lentiviral vectors to *ex vivo* CD34-positive stem cell gene therapies and increasingly sophisticated gene-modified cell therapies like CAR-T,” said [Johnathon Anderson](https://www.peptidesystems.com/about), PhD, a research scientist, CEO of Peptide Systems, and associate professor at the UC Davis School of Medicine. “We’re seeing these products move beyond hematologic malignancies into solid tumors and autoimmune disease.”

Plus, the steady number of [FDA approvals for cell and gene therapies](https://wewillcure.com/insights/cell-and-gene-therapeutics/rare-diseases/fda-faster-cell-gene-therapy-reviews) over the last few years demonstrates that this field of study is no longer a boutique experiment, Anderson notes. Instead, it is an evolving and maturing field of study that is touching real people with cancer, rare diseases, autoimmune diseases, and more.
“Overall, [gene therapies](https://wewillcure.com/insights/cell-and-gene-therapeutics/despite-twice-the-fda-success-rate-gene-therapies-still-miss-patients) let researchers intervene at the level of the causal pathway. And the lessons we are learning will spill over into RNA medicines, protein engineering, and even small molecule drug discovery. So gene therapy…is accelerating our understanding of human biology in ways that benefit the whole therapeutic ecosystem.”

For this list, we are grouping gene therapies and gene-modified cell therapies together, reflecting how closely these fields now intersect across discovery, manufacturing, and clinical development. Advances in vector engineering, cell processing, automation, and regulatory pathways are increasingly shared, even as the underlying modalities differ.

While there are hundreds of companies working in this space, we selected 14 that stand out for their scientific ambition, clinical progress, or platform potential. Together, they offer a snapshot of where gene and cell therapy is headed in 2026, and how the next generation of genetic medicines is taking shape.
