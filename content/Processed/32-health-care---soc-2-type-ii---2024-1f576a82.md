### Scope

We have examined the description of the system for 32Health Inc. (“32Health” or the “Service Organization”) of its 32Health Health Admin Platform throughout the period December 14, 2023 to March 14, 2024 (the “Description”) based on the criteria for a description of a service organization's system in DC section 200, 2018 Description Criteria for a Description of a Service Organization's System in a SOC 2® Report in AICPA, Description Criteria (“description criteria”) and the suitability of the design and operating effectiveness of controls stated in the description throughout the period December 14, 2023 to March 14, 2024, to provide reasonable assurance that 32Health's service commitments and system requirements were achieved based on the trust services criteria relevant to security (“applicable trust services criteria”) set forth in TSP section 100, Trust Services Criteria for Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, and Privacy (AICPA, Trust Services Criteria).

32Health uses a subservice organization for cloud hosting services listed in Section III. The Description indicates that complementary user entity controls that are suitably designed and operating effectively are necessary, along with controls at 32Health, to achieve 32Health's service commitments and system requirements based on the applicable trust services criteria. The description presents 32Health's controls, the applicable trust services criteria, and the complementary user entity controls assumed in the design of 32Health's controls. Our examination did not include such complementary user entity controls and we have not evaluated the suitability of the design or operating effectiveness of such controls.

### Service Organization's Responsibilities

The Service Organization is responsible for its service commitments and system requirements and for designing, implementing, and operating effective controls within the system to provide reasonable assurance that Service Organization's service commitments and system requirements were achieved. The Service Organization has provided the accompanying assertion, “Management's Assertion” in Section II, ("assertion”) about the description and the suitability of design and operating effectiveness of controls stated therein. The Service Organization is also responsible for preparing the description and assertion, including the completeness, accuracy, and method of presentation of the description and assertion; providing the services covered

---

by the description; selecting the applicable trust services criteria and stating the related controls in the description; and identifying the risks that threaten the achievement of the service organization's service commitments and system requirements.

### Service Auditor's Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Description and on the suitability of the design and operating effectiveness of the controls stated in the Description based on our examination. Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). Those standards require that we plan and perform our examination to obtain reasonable assurance about whether, in all material respects, the Description is presented in accordance with the description criteria, and the controls stated therein were suitably designed and operating effectively to provide reasonable assurance that the service organization's service commitments and system requirements were achieved based on the applicable trust services criteria. We believe the evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

An examination of the description of a service organization's system and the suitability of the design and operating effectiveness of those controls involves the following:

*   Obtaining an understanding of the system and the service organization's service commitments and system requirements;
*   Assessing the risks that the description is not presented in accordance with the description criteria and that controls were not suitably designed;
*   Performing procedures to obtain evidence about whether the description is presented in accordance with the description criteria;
*   Performing procedures to obtain evidence about whether controls stated in the description were suitably designed to provide reasonable assurance that the service organization achieved its service commitments and system requirements based on the applicable trust services criteria;
*   Evaluating the overall presentation of the description.

Our examination also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.

### Service Auditor's Independence and Quality Control

We have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the Code of Professional Conduct established by the AICPA. We applied the statements on quality

---

control standards established by the AICPA, and accordingly, maintain a comprehensive system of quality control.

### Inherent Limitations

The Description is prepared to meet the common needs of a broad range of report users and may not, therefore, include every aspect of the system that individual users may consider important to meet their informational needs.

There are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system of internal control, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention of controls.

Because of their nature, controls may not always operate effectively to provide reasonable assurance that the service organization's service commitments and system requirements are achieved based on the applicable trust services criteria. Also, the projection to the future of any conclusions about the suitability of the design and operating effectiveness of controls is subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

### Description of Tests of Controls

The specific controls we tested, and the nature, timing, and results of our tests are listed in Section IV of this report.

### Opinion

In our opinion, in all material respects,

a. The Description fairly presents the 32Health Health Admin Platform systems of 32Health that was designed and implemented throughout the period December 14, 2023 to March 14, 2024 in accordance with the description criteria.

b. The controls stated in the Description were suitably designed throughout the period December 14, 2023 to March 14, 2024, to provide reasonable assurance that 32Health's service commitments and system requirements would be achieved based on the applicable trust services criteria, if the controls operated effectively throughout that period and the subservice organizations and user entities applied the complementary controls assumed in the design of the Service Organization's controls throughout that period.

c. The controls stated in the Description operated effectively throughout the period December 14, 2023 to March 14, 2024, to provide reasonable assurance that 32Health's service commitments and system requirements were achieved based on the applicable trust services criteria, if complementary subservice organization

---

controls and user entity controls assumed in the design of the Service Organization's controls operated effectively throughout that period.

### Restricted Use

This report, including the description of tests of controls and results thereof in Section IV, is intended solely for the information and use of 32Health, user entities of the in-scope services for 32Health's 32Health Health Admin Platform systems during some or all of the period December 14, 2023 to March 14, 2024, business partners of 32Health subject to risks arising from interactions with 32Health system, practitioners providing services to such user entities and business partners, prospective user entities and business partners, and regulators who have sufficient knowledge and understanding of the following:

*   The nature of the service provided by the Service Organization.
*   How the Service Organization's system interacts with user entities, business partners, subservice organizations, and other parties.
*   Internal control and its limitations.
*   Complementary user entity controls and complementary subservice organization controls and how they interact with related controls at the Service Organization to achieve the Service Organization's commitments and system requirements.
*   User entity responsibilities and how they may affect the user entity's ability to effectively use the Service Organization's services.
*   The applicable trust services criteria.
*   The risks that may threaten the achievement of the service organization's service commitments and system requirements and how controls address those risks.

This report is not intended to be, and should not, be used by anyone other than these specified parties.

#### Computer Operations - Availability

32Health maintains an incident response plan to guide employees on reporting and responding to any information security or data privacy events or incidents. Procedures are in place for identifying, reporting and acting upon breaches or other incidents.

32Health internally monitors all applications, including the web UI, databases, and cloud storage to ensure that service delivery matches SLA requirements.

32Health utilizes vulnerability scanning software that checks source code for common security issues as well as for vulnerabilities identified in open source dependencies and maintains an internal SLA for responding to those issues.

#### Change Management

32Health maintains documented Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) policies and procedures to guide personnel in documenting and implementing application and infrastructure changes. Change control procedures include change request and initiation processes, documentation requirements, development practices, quality assurance testing requirements, and required approval procedures.

A ticketing system is utilized to document the change control procedures for changes in the application and implementation of new changes. Quality assurance testing and User

---

Acceptance Testing (UAT) results are documented and maintained with the associated change request. Development and testing are performed in an environment that is logically separated from the production environment. Management approves changes prior to migration to the production environment and documents those approvals within the ticketing system.

Version control software is utilized to maintain source code versions and migrate source code through the development process to the production environment. The version control software maintains a history of code changes to support rollback capabilities and tracks changes to developers.

#### Data Communications

32Health has elected to use a platform-as-a-service (PaaS) to run its production infrastructure in part to avoid the complexity of network monitoring, configuration, and operations. The PaaS simplifies our logical network configuration by providing an effective firewall around all the 32Health application containers, with the only ingress from the network via HTTPS connections to designated web frontend endpoints.

The PaaS provider also automates the provisioning and deprovisioning of containers to match the desired configuration; if an application container fails, it will be automatically replaced, regardless of whether that failure is in the application or on underlying hardware.

32Health uses Google Cloud Command and security center for infrastructure vulnerabilities. We plan to do the annual penetration test in Q1 of 2024 as that's when we will go fully live with our customer.

### Boundaries of the System

The boundaries of the 32Health Health Admin Platform are the specific aspects of the Company's infrastructure, software, people, procedures, and data necessary to provide its services and that directly support the services provided to customers. Any infrastructure, software, people, procedures, and data that indirectly support the services provided to customers are not included within the boundaries of the 32Health Health Admin Platform.

This report does not include the Cloud Hosting Services provided by GCP at multiple facilities.

### Integrity and Ethical Values

The effectiveness of controls cannot rise above the integrity and ethical values of the people who create, administer, and monitor them. Integrity and ethical values are essential elements of 32Health's control environment, affecting the design, administration, and monitoring of other components. Integrity and ethical behavior are

---

the product of 32Health's ethical and behavioral standards, how they are communicated, and how they are reinforced in practices. They include management's actions to remove or reduce incentives and temptations that might prompt personnel to engage in dishonest, illegal, or unethical acts. They also include the communication of entity values and behavioral standards to personnel through policy statements and codes of conduct, as well as by example.

Specific control activities that the service organization has implemented in this area are described below:

*   Formally, documented organizational policy statements and codes of conduct communicate entity values and behavioral standards to personnel.
*   Policies and procedures require employees sign an acknowledgment form indicating they have been given access to the employee manual and understand their responsibility for adhering to the policies and procedures contained within the manual.
*   A confidentiality statement agreeing not to disclose proprietary or confidential information, including client information, to unauthorized parties is a component of the employee handbook.
*   Background checks are performed for employees as a component of the hiring process.

### Commitment to Competence

32Health's management defines competence as the knowledge and skills necessary to accomplish tasks that define employees' roles and responsibilities. Management's commitment to competence includes management's consideration of the competence levels for jobs and how those levels translate into the requisite skills and knowledge.

Specific control activities that the service organization has implemented in this area are described below:

*   Management has considered the competence levels for particular jobs and translated required skills and knowledge levels into written position requirements.
*   Training is provided to maintain the skill level of personnel in certain positions.

### Management's Philosophy and Operating Style

The 32Health management team must balance two competing interests: continuing to grow and develop in a cutting edge, rapidly changing technology space while remaining excellent and conservative stewards of the highly-sensitive data and workflows our customers entrust to us.

The management team meets frequently to be briefed on technology changes that impact the way 32Health can help customers build data workflows, as well as new security technologies that can help protect those workflows, and finally any regulatory

---

changes that may require 32Health to alter its software to maintain legal compliance. Major planned changes to the business are also reviewed by the management team to ensure they can be conducted in a way that is compatible with our core product offerings and duties to new and existing customers.

Specific control activities that the service organization has implemented in this area are described below:

*   Management is periodically briefed on regulatory and industry changes affecting the services provided.
*   Executive management meetings are held to discuss major initiatives and issues that affect the business.

### Organizational Structure and Assignment of Authority and Responsibility

32Health's organizational structure provides the framework within which its activities for achieving entity-wide objectives are planned, executed, controlled, and monitored. Management believes establishing a relevant organizational structure includes considering key areas of authority and responsibility. An organizational structure has been developed to suit its needs. This organizational structure is based, in part, on its size and the nature of its activities.

32Health's assignment of authority and responsibility activities include factors such as how authority and responsibility for operating activities are assigned and how reporting relationships and authorization hierarchies are established. It also includes policies relating to appropriate business practices, knowledge, and experience of key personnel, and resources provided for carrying out duties. In addition, it includes policies and communications directed at ensuring personnel understand the entity's objectives, know how their individual actions interrelate and contribute to those objectives, and recognize how and for what they will be held accountable.

Specific control activities that the service organization has implemented in this area are described below:

*   Organizational charts are in place to communicate key areas of authority and responsibility.
*   Organizational charts are communicated to employees and updated as needed.

### HR Policies and Practices

32Health's success is founded on sound business ethics, reinforced with a high level of efficiency, integrity, and ethical standards. The result of this success is evidenced by its proven track record for hiring and retaining top quality personnel who ensures the service organization is operating at maximum efficiency. 32Health's human resources policies and practices relate to employee hiring, orientation, training, evaluation, counseling, promotion, compensation, and disciplinary activities.

---

Specific control activities that the service organization has implemented in this area are described below:

*   New employees are required to sign acknowledgment forms for the employee handbook and a confidentiality agreement following new hire orientation on their first day of employment.
*   Evaluations for each employee are performed on an annual basis.
*   Employee termination procedures are in place to guide the termination process and are documented in a termination checklist.

### Risk Assessment Process

32Health's risk assessment process identifies and manages risks that could potentially affect 32Health's ability to provide reliable and secure services to our customers. As part of this process, 32Health maintains a risk register to track all systems and procedures that could present risks to meeting the company's objectives. Risks are evaluated by likelihood and impact, and management creates tasks to address risks that score highly on both dimensions. The risk register is reevaluated annually, and tasks are incorporated into the regular 32Health product development process so they can be dealt with predictably and iteratively.

### Integration with Risk Assessment

The environment in which the system operates; the commitments, agreements, and responsibilities of 32Health's system; as well as the nature of the components of the system result in risks that the criteria will not be met. 32Health addresses these risks through the implementation of suitably designed controls to provide reasonable assurance that the criteria are met. Because each system and the environment in which it operates are unique, the combination of risks to meeting the criteria and the controls necessary to address the risks will be unique. As part of the design and operation of the system, 32Health's management identifies the specific risks that the criteria will not be met and the controls necessary to address those risks.

### Information and Communication Systems

Information and communication are an integral component of 32Health's internal control system. It is the process of identifying, capturing, and exchanging information in the form and time frame necessary to conduct, manage, and control the entity's operations.

32Health uses several information and communication channels internally to share information with management, employees, contractors, and customers. 32Health uses chat systems and email as the primary internal and external communications channels.

---

Structured data is communicated internally via SaaS applications and project management tools. Finally, 32Health uses in-person and video “all hands” meetings to communicate company priorities and goals from management to all employees.

### Monitoring Controls

Management monitors controls to ensure that they are operating as intended and that controls are modified as conditions change. 32Health's management performs monitoring activities to continuously assess the quality of internal control over time. Necessary corrective actions are taken as required to correct deviations from company policies and procedures. Employee activity and adherence to company policies and procedures is also monitored. This process is accomplished through ongoing monitoring activities, separate evaluations, or a combination of the two.

### On-going Monitoring

32Health's management conducts quality assurance monitoring on a regular basis and additional training is provided based upon results of monitoring procedures. Monitoring activities are used to initiate corrective action through department meetings, internal conference calls, and informal notifications.

Management's close involvement in 32Health's operations helps to identify significant variances from expectations regarding internal controls. Upper management evaluates the facts and circumstances related to any suspected control breakdown. A decision for addressing any control's weakness is made based on whether the incident was isolated or requires a change in the company's procedures or personnel. The goal of this process is to ensure legal compliance and to maximize the performance of 32Health's personnel.

### Reporting Deficiencies

Our internal risk management tracking tool is utilized to document and track the results of on-going monitoring procedures. Escalation procedures are maintained for responding and notifying management of any identified risks, and instructions for escalation are supplied to employees in company policy documents. Risks receiving a high rating are responded to immediately. Corrective actions, if necessary, are documented and tracked within the internal tracking tool. Annual risk meetings are held for management to review reported deficiencies and corrective actions.

### Subservice Organizations

This report does not include the Cloud Hosting Services provided by GCP at multiple facilities.

### Subservice Description of Services

The Cloud Hosting Services provided by GCP support the physical infrastructure of the entities services.

### Complementary Subservice Organization Controls

32Health's services are designed with the assumption that certain controls will be implemented by subservice organizations. Such controls are called complementary subservice organization controls. It is not feasible for all of the trust services criteria related to 32Health's services to be solely achieved by 32Health control procedures. Accordingly, subservice organizations, in conjunction with the services, should establish their own internal controls or procedures to complement those of 32Health.

The following subservice organization controls have been implemented by Google Cloud Platform and included in this report to provide additional assurance that the trust services criteria are met.

32Health management, along with the subservice provider, define the scope and responsibility of the controls necessary to meet all the relevant trust services criteria through written contracts, such as service level agreements. In addition, 32Health performs monitoring of the subservice organization controls, including the following procedures:

*   Holding periodic discussions with vendors and subservice organization(s)
*   Reviewing attestation reports over services provided by vendors and subservice organization(s)

### Complementary User Entity Controls

32Health's services are designed with the assumption that certain controls will be implemented by user entities. Such controls are called complementary user entity controls. It is not feasible for all the Trust Services Criteria related to 32Health's services to be solely achieved by 32Health control procedures. Accordingly, user entities, in conjunction with the services, should establish their own internal controls or procedures to complement those of 32Health's.

The following complementary user entity controls should be implemented by user entities to provide additional assurance that the Trust Services Criteria described within this report are met. As these items represent only a part of the control considerations that might be pertinent at the user entities' locations, user entities' auditors should exercise judgment in selecting and reviewing these complementary user entity controls.

1.  User entities are responsible for understanding and complying with their contractual obligations to 32Health.
2.  User entities are responsible for notifying 32Health of changes made to technical or administrative contact information.
3.  User entities are responsible for maintaining their own system(s) of record.
4.  User entities are responsible for ensuring the supervision, management, and control of the use of 32Health services by their personnel.

---

5.  User entities are responsible for developing their own disaster recovery and business continuity plans that address the inability to access or utilize 32Health services.
6.  User entities are responsible for providing 32Health with a list of approvers for security and system configuration changes for data transmission.
7.  User entities are responsible for immediately notifying 32Health of any actual or suspected information security breaches, including compromised user accounts, including those used for integrations and secure file transfers.

## SECTION I: INDEPENDENT SERVICE AUDITOR'S REPORT

### Scope

We have examined the description of the system for 32Health Inc. (“32Health” or the “Service Organization”) of its 32Health Health Admin Platform throughout the period December 14, 2023 to March 14, 2024 (the “Description”) based on the criteria for a description of a service organization's system in DC section 200, 2018 Description Criteria for a Description of a Service Organization's System in a SOC 2® Report in AICPA, Description Criteria (“description criteria") and the suitability of the design and operating effectiveness of controls stated in the description throughout the period December 14, 2023 to March 14, 2024, to provide reasonable assurance that 32Health's service commitments and system requirements were achieved based on the trust services criteria relevant to security (“applicable trust services criteria") set forth in TSP section 100, Trust Services Criteria for Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, and Privacy (AICPA, Trust Services Criteria).

32Health uses a subservice organization for cloud hosting services listed in Section III. The Description indicates that complementary user entity controls that are suitably designed and operating effectively are necessary, along with controls at 32Health, to achieve 32Health's service commitments and system requirements based on the applicable trust services criteria. The description presents 32Health's controls, the applicable trust services criteria, and the complementary user entity controls assumed in the design of 32Health's controls. Our examination did not include such complementary user entity controls and we have not evaluated the suitability of the design or operating effectiveness of such controls.

### Service Organization's Responsibilities

The Service Organization is responsible for its service commitments and system requirements and for designing, implementing, and operating effective controls within the system to provide reasonable assurance that Service Organization's service commitments and system requirements were achieved. The Service Organization has provided the accompanying assertion, “Management's Assertion” in Section II, ("assertion”) about the description and the suitability of design and operating effectiveness of controls stated therein. The Service Organization is also responsible for preparing the description and assertion, including the completeness, accuracy, and method of presentation of the description and assertion; providing the services covered

---

by the description; selecting the applicable trust services criteria and stating the related controls in the description; and identifying the risks that threaten the achievement of the service organization's service commitments and system requirements.

### Service Auditor's Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Description and on the suitability of the design and operating effectiveness of the controls stated in the Description based on our examination. Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). Those standards require that we plan and perform our examination to obtain reasonable assurance about whether, in all material respects, the Description is presented in accordance with the description criteria, and the controls stated therein were suitably designed and operating effectively to provide reasonable assurance that the service organization's service commitments and system requirements were achieved based on the applicable trust services criteria. We believe the evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

An examination of the description of a service organization's system and the suitability of the design and operating effectiveness of those controls involves the following:

*   Obtaining an understanding of the system and the service organization's service commitments and system requirements;
*   Assessing the risks that the description is not presented in accordance with the description criteria and that controls were not suitably designed;
*   Performing procedures to obtain evidence about whether the description is presented in accordance with the description criteria;
*   Performing procedures to obtain evidence about whether controls stated in the description were suitably designed to provide reasonable assurance that the service organization achieved its service commitments and system requirements based on the applicable trust services criteria;
*   Evaluating the overall presentation of the description.

Our examination also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.

### Service Auditor's Independence and Quality Control

We have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the Code of Professional Conduct established by the AICPA. We applied the statements on quality

---

control standards established by the AICPA, and accordingly, maintain a comprehensive system of quality control.

### Inherent Limitations

The Description is prepared to meet the common needs of a broad range of report users and may not, therefore, include every aspect of the system that individual users may consider important to meet their informational needs.

There are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system of internal control, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention of controls.

Because of their nature, controls may not always operate effectively to provide reasonable assurance that the service organization's service commitments and system requirements are achieved based on the applicable trust services criteria. Also, the projection to the future of any conclusions about the suitability of the design and operating effectiveness of controls is subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

### Description of Tests of Controls

The specific controls we tested, and the nature, timing, and results of our tests are listed in Section IV of this report.

### Opinion

In our opinion, in all material respects,

a. The Description fairly presents the 32Health Health Admin Platform systems of 32Health that was designed and implemented throughout the period December 14, 2023 to March 14, 2024 in accordance with the description criteria.

b. The controls stated in the Description were suitably designed throughout the period December 14, 2023 to March 14, 2024, to provide reasonable assurance that 32Health's service commitments and system requirements would be achieved based on the applicable trust services criteria, if the controls operated effectively throughout that period and the subservice organizations and user entities applied the complementary controls assumed in the design of the Service Organization's controls throughout that period.

c. The controls stated in the Description operated effectively throughout the period December 14, 2023 to March 14, 2024, to provide reasonable assurance that 32Health's service commitments and system requirements were achieved based on the applicable trust services criteria, if complementary subservice organization

*(**Chart Data Extraction Note**: Pages 14-16 display multiple network diagrams. These diagrams illustrate the network topology for various environments such as "research-392909", "business-391218", "development-366017", "staging-385515", and "prod-396213". They depict network boundaries, firewall rules (e.g., allow-icmp, allow-internal, allow-http, allow-https, allow-ssh), routing configurations, and other cloud components. As these are visual representations of system architecture rather than data charts with numerical values, detailed tabular data extraction in the typical sense (e.g., from bar or pie charts) is not applicable. The text on page 17 provides a summary of the in-scope infrastructure and software components in a tabular format.)*

Customer data is managed, processed, and stored in accordance with the relevant data protection and other regulations, with specific requirements formally established in customer agreements, if any. Customer data is captured which is utilized by the company in delivering its services.

All employees and contractors of the company are obligated to respect and, in all cases, to protect customer data. Additionally, 32Health has policies and procedures in place to proper and secure handling of customer data. These policies and procedures are reviewed on at least an annual basis.

### Processes and Procedures

Management has developed and communicated policies and procedures to manage the information security of the system. Changes to these procedures are performed annually and authorized by management, the executive team, and control owners. These procedures cover the following key security life cycle areas:

*   Physical Security
*   Logical Access
*   Change Control
*   Data Communications
*   Risk Assessment
*   Data Retention
*   Vendor Management

#### Physical Security

32Health's production servers are maintained by Google Cloud Platform. The physical and environmental security protections are the responsibility of Google Cloud Platform. 32Health reviews the attestation reports and performs a risk analysis of Google Cloud Platform on at least an annual basis.

#### Logical Access

32Health provides employees and contracts access to infrastructure via a role-based access control system, to ensure uniform, least privilege access to identified users and to maintain simple and reportable user provisioning and deprovisioning processes.

---

Access to these systems are split into admin roles, user roles, and no access roles. User access and roles are reviewed on an annual basis to ensure least privilege access.

management is responsible for provision access to the system based on the employee's role and performing a background check. The employee is responsible for reviewing 32Health's policies, completing security training. These steps must be completed within 14 days of hire.

When an employee is terminated, management is responsible for deprovisioning access to all in scope systems within 3 days for that employee's termination.

#### Computer Operations - Backups

Customer data is backed up and monitored by the CTO, Head of Engineering for completion and exceptions. If there is an exception, CTO, Head of Engineering will perform troubleshooting to identify the root cause and either rerun the backup or as part of the next scheduled backup job.

Backup infrastructure is maintained in Google Cloud Platform with physical access restricted according to the policies. Backups are encrypted, with access restricted to key personnel.

#### Computer Operations - Availability

32Health maintains an incident response plan to guide employees on reporting and responding to any information security or data privacy events or incidents. Procedures are in place for identifying, reporting and acting upon breaches or other incidents.

32Health internally monitors all applications, including the web UI, databases, and cloud storage to ensure that service delivery matches SLA requirements.

32Health utilizes vulnerability scanning software that checks source code for common security issues as well as for vulnerabilities identified in open source dependencies and maintains an internal SLA for responding to those issues.

#### Change Management

32Health maintains documented Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) policies and procedures to guide personnel in documenting and implementing application and infrastructure changes. Change control procedures include change request and initiation processes, documentation requirements, development practices, quality assurance testing requirements, and required approval procedures.

A ticketing system is utilized to document the change control procedures for changes in the application and implementation of new changes. Quality assurance testing and User

---

Acceptance Testing (UAT) results are documented and maintained with the associated change request. Development and testing are performed in an environment that is logically separated from the production environment. Management approves changes prior to migration to the production environment and documents those approvals within the ticketing system.

Version control software is utilized to maintain source code versions and migrate source code through the development process to the production environment. The version control software maintains a history of code changes to support rollback capabilities and tracks changes to developers.

#### Data Communications

32Health has elected to use a platform-as-a-service (PaaS) to run its production infrastructure in part to avoid the complexity of network monitoring, configuration, and operations. The PaaS simplifies our logical network configuration by providing an effective firewall around all the 32Health application containers, with the only ingress from the network via HTTPS connections to designated web frontend endpoints.

The PaaS provider also automates the provisioning and deprovisioning of containers to match the desired configuration; if an application container fails, it will be automatically replaced, regardless of whether that failure is in the application or on underlying hardware.

32Health uses Google Cloud Command and security center for infrastructure vulnerabilities. We plan to do the annual penetration test in Q1 of 2024 as that's when we will go fully live with our customer.

### Boundaries of the System

The boundaries of the 32Health Health Admin Platform are the specific aspects of the Company's infrastructure, software, people, procedures, and data necessary to provide its services and that directly support the services provided to customers. Any infrastructure, software, people, procedures, and data that indirectly support the services provided to customers are not included within the boundaries of the 32Health Health Admin Platform.

This report does not include the Cloud Hosting Services provided by GCP at multiple facilities.

### Integrity and Ethical Values

The effectiveness of controls cannot rise above the integrity and ethical values of the people who create, administer, and monitor them. Integrity and ethical values are essential elements of 32Health's control environment, affecting the design, administration, and monitoring of other components. Integrity and ethical behavior are

---

the product of 32Health's ethical and behavioral standards, how they are communicated, and how they are reinforced in practices. They include management's actions to remove or reduce incentives and temptations that might prompt personnel to engage in dishonest, illegal, or unethical acts. They also include the communication of entity values and behavioral standards to personnel through policy statements and codes of conduct, as well as by example.

Specific control activities that the service organization has implemented in this area are described below:

*   Formally, documented organizational policy statements and codes of conduct communicate entity values and behavioral standards to personnel.
*   Policies and procedures require employees sign an acknowledgment form indicating they have been given access to the employee manual and understand their responsibility for adhering to the policies and procedures contained within the manual.
*   A confidentiality statement agreeing not to disclose proprietary or confidential information, including client information, to unauthorized parties is a component of the employee handbook.
*   Background checks are performed for employees as a component of the hiring process.

### Commitment to Competence

32Health's management defines competence as the knowledge and skills necessary to accomplish tasks that define employees' roles and responsibilities. Management's commitment to competence includes management's consideration of the competence levels for jobs and how those levels translate into the requisite skills and knowledge.

Specific control activities that the service organization has implemented in this area are described below:

*   Management has considered the competence levels for particular jobs and translated required skills and knowledge levels into written position requirements.
*   Training is provided to maintain the skill level of personnel in certain positions.

### Management's Philosophy and Operating Style

The 32Health management team must balance two competing interests: continuing to grow and develop in a cutting edge, rapidly changing technology space while remaining excellent and conservative stewards of the highly-sensitive data and workflows our customers entrust to us.

The management team meets frequently to be briefed on technology changes that impact the way 32Health can help customers build data workflows, as well as new security technologies that can help protect those workflows, and finally any regulatory

---

changes that may require 32Health to alter its software to maintain legal compliance. Major planned changes to the business are also reviewed by the management team to ensure they can be conducted in a way that is compatible with our core product offerings and duties to new and existing customers.

Specific control activities that the service organization has implemented in this area are described below:

*   Management is periodically briefed on regulatory and industry changes affecting the services provided.
*   Executive management meetings are held to discuss major initiatives and issues that affect the business.

### Organizational Structure and Assignment of Authority and Responsibility

32Health's organizational structure provides the framework within which its activities for achieving entity-wide objectives are planned, executed, controlled, and monitored. Management believes establishing a relevant organizational structure includes considering key areas of authority and responsibility. An organizational structure has been developed to suit its needs. This organizational structure is based, in part, on its size and the nature of its activities.

32Health's assignment of authority and responsibility activities include factors such as how authority and responsibility for operating activities are assigned and how reporting relationships and authorization hierarchies are established. It also includes policies relating to appropriate business practices, knowledge, and experience of key personnel, and resources provided for carrying out duties. In addition, it includes policies and communications directed at ensuring personnel understand the entity's objectives, know how their individual actions interrelate and contribute to those objectives, and recognize how and for what they will be held accountable.

Specific control activities that the service organization has implemented in this area are described below:

*   Organizational charts are in place to communicate key areas of authority and responsibility.
*   Organizational charts are communicated to employees and updated as needed.

### HR Policies and Practices

32Health's success is founded on sound business ethics, reinforced with a high level of efficiency, integrity, and ethical standards. The result of this success is evidenced by its proven track record for hiring and retaining top quality personnel who ensures the service organization is operating at maximum efficiency. 32Health's human resources policies and practices relate to employee hiring, orientation, training, evaluation, counseling, promotion, compensation, and disciplinary activities.

Specific control activities that the service organization has implemented in this area are described below:

*   New employees are required to sign acknowledgment forms for the employee handbook and a confidentiality agreement following new hire orientation on their first day of employment.
*   Evaluations for each employee are performed on an annual basis.
*   Employee termination procedures are in place to guide the termination process and are documented in a termination checklist.

### Risk Assessment Process

32Health's risk assessment process identifies and manages risks that could potentially affect 32Health's ability to provide reliable and secure services to our customers. As part of this process, 32Health maintains a risk register to track all systems and procedures that could present risks to meeting the company's objectives. Risks are evaluated by likelihood and impact, and management creates tasks to address risks that score highly on both dimensions. The risk register is reevaluated annually, and tasks are incorporated into the regular 32Health product development process so they can be dealt with predictably and iteratively.

### Integration with Risk Assessment

The environment in which the system operates; the commitments, agreements, and responsibilities of 32Health's system; as well as the nature of the components of the system result in risks that the criteria will not be met. 32Health addresses these risks through the implementation of suitably designed controls to provide reasonable assurance that the criteria are met. Because each system and the environment in which it operates are unique, the combination of risks to meeting the criteria and the controls necessary to address the risks will be unique. As part of the design and operation of the system, 32Health's management identifies the specific risks that the criteria will not be met and the controls necessary to address those risks.

### Information and Communication Systems

Information and communication are an integral component of 32Health's internal control system. It is the process of identifying, capturing, and exchanging information in the form and time frame necessary to conduct, manage, and control the entity's operations.

32Health uses several information and communication channels internally to share information with management, employees, contractors, and customers. 32Health uses chat systems and email as the primary internal and external communications channels.

---

Structured data is communicated internally via SaaS applications and project management tools. Finally, 32Health uses in-person and video “all hands” meetings to communicate company priorities and goals from management to all employees.

### Monitoring Controls

Management monitors controls to ensure that they are operating as intended and that controls are modified as conditions change. 32Health's management performs monitoring activities to continuously assess the quality of internal control over time. Necessary corrective actions are taken as required to correct deviations from company policies and procedures. Employee activity and adherence to company policies and procedures is also monitored. This process is accomplished through ongoing monitoring activities, separate evaluations, or a combination of the two.

### On-going Monitoring

32Health's management conducts quality assurance monitoring on a regular basis and additional training is provided based upon results of monitoring procedures. Monitoring activities are used to initiate corrective action through department meetings, internal conference calls, and informal notifications.

Management's close involvement in 32Health's operations helps to identify significant variances from expectations regarding internal controls. Upper management evaluates the facts and circumstances related to any suspected control breakdown. A decision for addressing any control's weakness is made based on whether the incident was isolated or requires a change in the company's procedures or personnel. The goal of this process is to ensure legal compliance and to maximize the performance of 32Health's personnel.

### Reporting Deficiencies

Our internal risk management tracking tool is utilized to document and track the results of on-going monitoring procedures. Escalation procedures are maintained for responding and notifying management of any identified risks, and instructions for escalation are supplied to employees in company policy documents. Risks receiving a high rating are responded to immediately. Corrective actions, if necessary, are documented and tracked within the internal tracking tool. Annual risk meetings are held for management to review reported deficiencies and corrective actions.

### Changes to the System

### Incidents

No significant incidents have occurred to the services provided to users during the review period.

### Criteria Not Applicable to the System

All Common Criteria/Security criteria were applicable to the 32Health's 32Health Health Admin Platform system.

### Subservice Organizations

This report does not include the Cloud Hosting Services provided by GCP at multiple facilities.

### Subservice Description of Services

The Cloud Hosting Services provided by GCP support the physical infrastructure of the entities services.

### Complementary Subservice Organization Controls

32Health's services are designed with the assumption that certain controls will be implemented by subservice organizations. Such controls are called complementary subservice organization controls. It is not feasible for all of the trust services criteria related to 32Health's services to be solely achieved by 32Health control procedures. Accordingly, subservice organizations, in conjunction with the services, should establish their own internal controls or procedures to complement those of 32Health.

The following subservice organization controls have been implemented by Google Cloud Platform and included in this report to provide additional assurance that the trust services criteria are met.

32Health management, along with the subservice provider, define the scope and responsibility of the controls necessary to meet all the relevant trust services criteria through written contracts, such as service level agreements. In addition, 32Health performs monitoring of the subservice organization controls, including the following procedures:

*   Holding periodic discussions with vendors and subservice organization(s)
*   Reviewing attestation reports over services provided by vendors and subservice organization(s)

### Complementary User Entity Controls

32Health's services are designed with the assumption that certain controls will be implemented by user entities. Such controls are called complementary user entity controls. It is not feasible for all the Trust Services Criteria related to 32Health's services to be solely achieved by 32Health control procedures. Accordingly, user entities, in conjunction with the services, should establish their own internal controls or procedures to complement those of 32Health's.

The following complementary user entity controls should be implemented by user entities to provide additional assurance that the Trust Services Criteria described within this report are met. As these items represent only a part of the control considerations that might be pertinent at the user entities' locations, user entities' auditors should exercise judgment in selecting and reviewing these complementary user entity controls.

1.  User entities are responsible for understanding and complying with their contractual obligations to 32Health.
2.  User entities are responsible for notifying 32Health of changes made to technical or administrative contact information.
3.  User entities are responsible for maintaining their own system(s) of record.
4.  User entities are responsible for ensuring the supervision, management, and control of the use of 32Health services by their personnel.

---

5.  User entities are responsible for developing their own disaster recovery and business continuity plans that address the inability to access or utilize 32Health services.
6.  User entities are responsible for providing 32Health with a list of approvers for security and system configuration changes for data transmission.
7.  User entities are responsible for immediately notifying 32Health of any actual or suspected information security breaches, including compromised user accounts, including those used for integrations and secure file transfers.
