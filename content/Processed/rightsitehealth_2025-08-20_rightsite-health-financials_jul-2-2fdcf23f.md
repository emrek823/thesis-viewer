## Overview and MD&A

July net revenue came in nearly on par with forecast. We had the highest number of Submitted for Billing claims submissions YTD.

Molina TX case rate amendment was agreed and signed with an effective date of 7/15/2025. United and BCBS TX saw significant progress with Senior leadership support. Other forecasted payor start dates remain our best estimate.

Adjusted Patient Expenses were below forecast. We normalized physician comp to account for the incremental physician spend ($29.1k) from the CMO leadership change at the physician practice. To ensure the continuity of our service during this time with no coverage gaps, we accelerated physician onboarding and overstaffed physician capacity. We expect these costs to recede in Aug/Sep as we return to normal physician staffing levels. Optimization of patient care costs remain a high visibility goal for the Care Team and direct patient care costs came down for the second month in a row.

Note, to support the launch of Ft. Worth, TX (go live 8/19) and fast follow TX agencies in Sep, we began judiciously onboarding new navigators in July. We expect the launch will ultimately deliver > 60 activations per day giving us new scale for payor discussions. We've begun the hiring / onboarding of 2 nurse extenders in a pilot to offload time-consuming Care Team tasks like prescription processing, which we expect to increase physician and navigator capacity and reduce the cost per episode.

Adjusted SG&A was above forecast after adjusting for legal fees ($22.9k) associated with the CMO transition.

### MD&A

**July Snapshot**
* Activations ended the month slightly below forecast (-5%) but the second highest total volume of the year. Georgia was the primary driver of the Activation miss
* Launched a Same Store Growth strategy in GA focused on Grady, identifying an available 20+ calls/day
* Correspondingly, diversions were also below plan (-8%), a result of the the Activation miss in Georgia

**August Snapshot** - We re-organized the EMS team into a hunter/farmer model that should lead to more effective acct mgmt and increased Activations
* **Georgia** - ATL MSA coverage increased with East Point, Forest Park and Smyrna Fire awaiting signatures. Gwinnett and Cherokee Counties continued in contracting, targeting Q4 launches. Dougherty County EMS (Albany), went live 7/29 and Columbus Dispatch has locked October for go-live
* **Texas** - Fort Worth Fire went live 8/19 with an estimated climb to >60 Activations/day. Two additional contracts were executed - Montgomery Fire (Houston) and Bell County (I-35 Corridor). Six additional agencies moved to contracting in Central Texas, DFW and West Texas
* **Florida** - Increased EMS activity. Jacksonville Fire agreed to expand dispatch eligibility opening the door to 5x volume. Consistent engagement in Gainesville, Orlando, Palm Beach and Tallahassee signal Q4 contracting for larger Florida MSA's

### MD&A

In July, 708 (68%) Telehealth Calls included known insurance coverage. Of the the 708, we billed 525 FFS and Case Rate episodes ("Submitted for Billing”), or 74%.

* 108 Unable to Bill (15%) were in the “No Current Contract” category, a decrease from June (18%). Top plans
    * Oscar 38 (35%)
    * Cigna 30 (28%)
    * Humana TX 17 (16%)
* Two physicians still in credentialing accounted for 94% of the "Physician Not Effective” claims (64 total). We're currently onboarding multiple new physicians and remain focused on pushing effective dates with payors and tightening staffing schedules to reduce credentialing-related billing gaps
    * We are likely to receive retro effective dates for FFS and Case Rates when physicians are credentialed
* Uninsured/Unknown/Other made up 32% of Telehealth Calls, a small decline from prior months. We re-submit these claims after month-end and typically identify about 10% additional covered lives for billing. In August, we began a pilot with PointCare to support retroactive enrollment for uninsured patients

### MD&A

A shortfall in activation volume relative to forecast and a lower mix of patients with contracted RightSite coverage drove a negative variance in billable claims, resulting in a total negative variance of 149 (22%)

**FFS Claims**
Claim volume missed forecast: Medicaid 75 claims (-36%), Medicare 14 claims (-6%), Commercial 44 claims (-27%)
* In Georgia, the shortfall was broadly spread across the payors
* In Texas, total volume was in line with forecast; positive variances TX Medicaid and Aetna were offset by negative variances in BCBS and UNH

**Case Rate Claims**
* The negative variance was due to Georgia (15) with Humana and CareSource the primary drivers
