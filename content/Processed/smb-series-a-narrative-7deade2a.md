60 second elevator pitch: Standard Model Bio (SMB) is building multimodal foundational models (FMs) for biopharma and owners of biomedical data (academic medical centers, biobanks, patients, etc).

Goal: 2-3 bullets for each with 2-3 sentences to align on talking points and story to then translate into deck

Opportunity: Multi-modal FMs can improve performance for a variety of clinical development and commercial use cases in biopharma and unlock $50B in value

Multi-modal FMs have better performance and backbone is extensible across many tasks, which enable them can solve for a variety of high-value use cases - clinical trial design, optimizing PTRS, biomarker design, CDS (investors need specifics to anchor around vs. customers who we want to keep broad purposefully)

Y

Z

Problem: Data is siloed across modalities and institutions, and biopharma doesn’t have talent to build multi-modal FMs

Why now: Biopharma is looking to move beyond low-hanging fruit and needs new solutions to do so. Opportunity today to build data moat

Solution: Multi-modal foundational model [explaining image from deck]

How it works: Deliver a few lines of code to end-user

Biopharma Use Case: PTRS, imaging

AMC Use Case: Cardiotoxicity

Business Model: Quiet backbone / partner. Get paid for compute

GTM (Go-to-data strategy)

Ultimate Vision

Question bank (to fill in above if answers fit)

Is this drug discovery?

What are specific use cases?

Why are you serving health systems?

Why can’t OpenAI do this?

Do you compete or partner with [fill in the blank - Evo2, Blank Bio, Quant Health, etc] - why?
