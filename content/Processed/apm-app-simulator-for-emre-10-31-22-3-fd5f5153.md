## Slide 1

The APM simulator app: Automated decision support to help insurers deploy alternative payment models

Andrew Ryan, Ph.D.
Professor of Health Policy
Brown University


October 18, 2022

## Slide 2

Problem

Unsustainable spending growth in commercial insurance is  driving premium increases and low quality plans

Substantial waste in health care suggests spending can decline without compromising quality

Plans could benefit from more actionable guidance on APM deployment

Yet the optimal alternative payment models (APMs) to reduce spending growth and improve value are unclear

---

## Slide 3

We were contracted by Priority Health to identify the most promising APMs in Michigan

Aim 1. Identify the most promising APMs for the commercial population in Michigan

Aim 2. Develop an interactive tool to visualize the impact of APMs in Michigan to guide decisions

---

## Slide 4

This work addresses to two major gaps in knowledge and practice

No research to date has prospectively forecasted the impact of APMs

There are no widely used tools used by health plans to support the design and implementation of APMs

## Slide 5

APM design is important: most APMs implemented by CMS have lost money

## Slide 6

Our project considered the impact of 5 different APMs

## Slide 10

We used 2017-2020 claims data from Priority and BCBSM to profile provider spending

---

## Slide 11

We used 2017-2020 claims data from Priority and BCBSM to profile provider spending

We developed separate profiles developed for physician organizations and hospitals

---

## Slide 12

We used 2017-2020 claims data from Priority and BCBSM to profile provider spending

We developed separate profiles developed for physician organizations and hospitals

Profiles adjusted for patient risk based on age, gender, comorbidities, and other factors

---

## Slide 13

We used 2017-2020 claims data from Priority and BCBSM to profile provider spending

We developed separate profiles developed for physician organizations and hospitals

Claims were standardized to account for variation in prices across contracts and providers

Profiles adjusted for patient risk based on age, gender, comorbidities, and other factors

## Slide 27

We then built an interactive tool for users to query information about APM effectiveness

We coded a web-based application

Performed 3 user tests

Revised the tool based on test results
