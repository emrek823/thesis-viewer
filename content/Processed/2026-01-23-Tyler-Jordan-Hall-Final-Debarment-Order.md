## Abstract
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or the Agency) is issuing an order under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) debarring Tyler Jordan Hall for a period of 5 years from importing or offering for import any drug into the United States. FDA bases this order on a finding that Mr. Hall was convicted of a felony under Federal law for introduction of unapproved drugs into interstate commerce. The factual basis supporting Mr. Hall's conviction, as described below, is conduct relating to the importation into the United States of a drug or controlled substance. Mr. Hall was given notice of the proposed debarment and was given an opportunity to request a hearing to show why he should not be debarred. As of September 2, 2025 (30 days after receipt of the notice), Mr. Hall had not responded. Mr. Hall's failure to respond and request a hearing constitutes a waiver of his right to a hearing concerning this matter.
