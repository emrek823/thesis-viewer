## Purpose

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is seeking information from Venture Capital (VC) firms regarding their interest in and requirements for a novel contract vehicle that would enable portfolio companies to compete directly for FDA contracts and task orders.

## Background

The FDA recognizes that many breakthrough technologies and innovative solutions relevant to our public health mission are being developed by companies within VC portfolios. These companies often possess cutting-edge capabilities in areas such as artificial intelligence, biotechnology, medical devices, and regulatory technology that could significantly benefit FDA operations and the broader public health ecosystem.

Historically, the FDA's engagement with startup and emerging technology companies has been constrained or limited due to:

*   Utilization of pass-through organizations or prime contractors, which can create barriers to direct engagement and limit scalability. Furthermore, disincentives often exist such that prime contractors focus on increasing labor-based work instead of scaling technologies.
*   Navigation of a complex federal bureaucracy that may be prohibitive for innovative firms focused on product development. It takes small and innovative companies a lot of dedicated time, energy, and funding to provide products and services to the government.

## Information Requested

Organizations are invited to submit a response tailored to the information requested, taking into consideration the "Purpose" and "Background" described above. Respondents shall include, but are not limited to, addressing their experience and capabilities in the following areas:

### Company information:

Interested and capable vendors (parties) shall submit electronically in PDF Capability Statement with a maximum of 20 pages, excluding appendices in response to this notice with the following information:

Provide a brief description of your firm's investment focus and portfolio composition, specific responses to the information requested, and any additional recommendations or considerations not addressed.

Information in this profile to the maximum extent practicable shall include:

*   Company Name
*   Mailing Address
*   Name, telephone number, and e-mail address of a point of contact having the authority and knowledge to clarify responses with Government representatives.
*   SAM Status. Companies must be registered in the SAM (www.sam.gov) at the time of contract award to be considered as potential sources. SAM registration is not required to respond to this RFI.
*   Unique Entity Identifier (UEI)
*   Socio Economic Status
*   Your proposed NAICS for this effort
*   Your GSA Schedule

Please respond to the questions below broadly; specificity is not necessary at this time.
The FDA is exploring the development of a contract vehicle that would:

*   Establish direct contractual relationships with qualified VC firms
*   Enable any company within an approved firm's portfolio to compete for and receive task orders under the vehicle. To adhere to federal contracting requirements, portfolio companies will be treated as subcontractors.
*   Streamline the procurement process for innovative technologies and services
*   Provide a scalable mechanism for engaging with the startup ecosystem
*   Maintain appropriate oversight and compliance with federal acquisition regulations

### Interest and Feasibility

*   Would your firm be interested in functioning as a Prime contractors such that any of your portfolio companies can be treated as subcontractors?
*   What barriers or challenges do you foresee with this approach?

### Structural Requirements

*   Current government contracting regulations would require that the VC firm would be the Prime and any portfolio companies who can provide technology or services would be subcontractors. Is this a structure your firm can support? If not, please provide feedback a type of structure that would work.
*   How should intellectual property rights be structured and protected?

### Venture Capital Firm Qualifications

*   How should the FDA evaluate a firm's track record in portfolio company oversight and governance?
*   What financial stability and bonding requirements should apply to participating VC firms?
*   Should there be requirements related to the firm's investment thesis, sector focus, assets under management, years in operation, or geographic presence?
*   What ongoing certification or recertification processes should be established for participating firms?
*   How should the FDA assess a firm's capability to ensure portfolio company compliance with federal contracting requirements?
*   What organizational structure or dedicated resources should firms maintain to support this contract vehicle?

### Financial and Administrative Considerations

*   What payment and invoicing structures would be most efficient?
*   How should performance bonds, guarantees, or other financial assurances be handled?
*   What reporting requirements would be appropriate for both the VC firms and portfolio companies?

### Regulatory and Compliance Framework

*   What compliance requirements should apply to participating VC firms?
*   How should conflicts of interest be identified and managed?
*   What due diligence processes would be necessary for both firms and portfolio companies?

### Implementation Timeline and Process

*   What would be a reasonable timeline for implementing such a vehicle?
*   What pilot or phased approach would be most effective?
*   What industry engagement would be necessary during development?
