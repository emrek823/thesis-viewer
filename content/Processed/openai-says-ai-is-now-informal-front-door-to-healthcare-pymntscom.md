OpenAI Says AI Is Now Informal Front Door to Healthcare

BY PYMNTS  |  JANUARY 6, 2026

Artificial intelligence (AI) has quietly become one of the most widely used entry points into the healthcare system. According to OpenAI’s January 2026 report, “AI as a Healthcare Ally,” more than 40 million people worldwide use ChatGPT every day for health-related questions, a scale that places AI alongside primary care, urgent care and telehealth as a first stop for medical information.

Health prompts now account for over 5% of all messages sent to ChatGPT globally. Among the platform’s roughly 800 million weekly users, about 200 million engage with health topics at least once per week.

Timing data reinforces that shift. OpenAI found that about 70% of health-related conversations occur outside traditional clinic hours, when access to clinicians is limited. In rural and underserved regions, users generate hundreds of thousands of healthcare-related messages each week, signaling that AI fills gaps where physical access to care remains constrained.

Administrative complexity also drives adoption. OpenAI reported that roughly 1.6 million to 1.9 million messages per week focus on health insurance, including plan selection, billing disputes and coverage questions. These inquiries often overwhelm provider offices and payer call centers, pushing consumers toward AI tools that provide immediate explanations and next-step guidance.

The report also highlights growing professional use. Sixty-six percent of U.S. physicians and nearly 50% of nurses said they use AI for at least one healthcare-related task, including documentation, information review and administrative support. That overlap between consumer and clinician usage suggests AI is embedding itself across the healthcare workflow rather than remaining a standalone consumer tool.

Rising Comfort With AI for Health

OpenAI’s findings align with broader consumer behavior tracked by PYMNTS Intelligence, which shows AI becoming a starting point for everyday decisions. PYMNTS found that more than 60% of U.S. consumers used a dedicated AI platform in the past year, reflecting mainstream adoption rather than early experimentation.

Younger users accelerate the shift. PYMNTS data shows more than one-third of Gen Z consumers now begin personal tasks directly with AI. While healthcare represents only one category within that broader pattern, it reflects growing comfort using AI for sensitive and high-stakes topics traditionally handled by professionals.

OpenAI’s report reinforces this behavioral change. Among U.S. respondents, 55% said they use ChatGPT to understand symptoms, 52% to get answers at any time of day, 48% to decode medical terminology, and 44% to learn about treatment options. These are foundational steps in the healthcare journey, shaping how patients prepare for appointments and decide when to seek professional care.

Benefits Scale Faster Than Guardrails

The rapid expansion of AI as a healthcare entry point creates clear benefits alongside unresolved risks. On the benefit side, AI absorbs demand that healthcare systems struggle to manage efficiently. By answering basic questions, clarifying medical language, and helping users navigate insurance and administrative complexity, AI reduces friction for both patients and providers.
