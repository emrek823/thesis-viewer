## Initiating Coverage of a Differentiated Specialty Laboratory Business With an Outperform Rating

We are initiating coverage of Tempus AI with an Outperform rating, based on what we believe is a massive market opportunity, Tempus's differentiated approach and business model, and a reasonable valuation level provided the company is able to execute on targets over the near and intermediate term. Key highlights of our investment thesis are below.

**Tempus has built a differentiated business with meaningful scale.** Founded on the premise that amassing and analyzing data can result in better patient care, the Tempus platform frees healthcare data from silos and makes sense of it. Combining molecular data from its lab with multimodal data from healthcare institutions and associations, Tempus provides contextualized patient reports, and this data becomes fuel to improve offerings and create other product lines for physicians, researchers, and pharma.

**The initial market opportunity in oncology is massive.** We believe the market for NGS-based therapy selection tests is approaching penetration of 30%, with Tempus's market share in the mid-20% range. As guidelines supporting concurrent testing (i.e., both liquid biopsy and solid tumor testing) expand, the utility of RNA testing becomes more apparent, and minimal residual disease and recurrence monitoring become standard of care, Tempus has the test menu to drive significant growth over the coming years.

**But oncology is just the beginning.** Tempus has established its platform first in oncology. Moving forward, though, this can be deployed across different disease states and into AI-based applications to reduce care gaps and provide better diagnostics. Emerging categories include neuropsychiatry, cardiology, and radiology.

**Compelling revenue growth with line of sight to profitability.** We model Tempus to grow revenue at a 34% compound annual rate from 2023 through 2026, above its peer group (19%, on average). Further, a path to adjusted EBITDA positivity and free cash flow generation should emerge.

**Valuation.** Tempus trades at 5.5 times 2025 revenue, in line with its peer group, which is reasonable given its faster top-line growth profile and differentiated data business.

**Risks to consider include:** 1) intense competition with established specialty lab peers, 2) unproven scale beyond oncology, 3) dual share class structure, 4) reimbursement and regulatory risks, and 5) reliability on revenue growth to drive profitability and cash flow.

Tempus AI provides precision medicine solutions for patients and uses its data platform to offer insights for researchers and pharma companies. Through sequencing and data aggregation, Tempus has amassed one of the world's largest libraries of clinical and molecular data.

## Introduction and Executive Summary

Tempus AI, formerly known as Tempus Labs, was founded in Chicago in 2015 by serial entrepreneur Eric Lefkofsky, who also founded other technology-based companies, like Groupon, Echo Global Logistics, and InnerWorkings. At that time, Lefkofsky's wife had been recently diagnosed with breast cancer and Lefkofsky saw the need, opportunity, and unique timing potential to build a platform that could better aid patients in their cancer journey (through better therapy selection). He also saw an opportunity to amass both clinical and molecular data that could help further advance research and personalized medicine.

Over the last nine years, Tempus has grown significantly. In 2023, the company posted revenue of $532 million (+77% core; +66% reported), reported roughly 218,000 clinical oncology test results (+48%), and had amassed one of the world's largest databases that contains clinical and molecular oncology data. From here, we believe Tempus is positioned to grow revenue at 30%-plus over the next three years, driven by strength across its clinical oncology portfolio (namely in therapy selection today, but moving into MRD over time) and data and services line items, with remaining committed contract values totaling over $900 million, including opt-ins. We also believe Tempus should progress on its path to adjusted EBITDA profitability and free cash flow, which we model to occur in late 2025 and 2026, respectively.

Tempus is a differentiated asset in the precision medicine landscape. Its long-term business model is rooted in data collection and technology applications, as opposed to some other specialty lab providers who generate meaningful data in their own right but for whom this data is not internally married with other forms of data. Tempus believes that by pairing data from the company's testing laboratories (e.g., DNA and RNA data) with multimodal data that it collects from healthcare institutions and associations (e.g., longitudinal clinical notes and imaging and pathology reports), it can provide contextualized patient reports and that data, in turn, becomes the fuel to improve offerings and create other product lines like data and services, or AI Applications (or Algos). Said different, each of the three main product lines (genomics, data and services, and Algos) creates a flywheel whereby they rely and improve on each other over time.

We view this as a unique model and part of the longer-term thesis on the name. But for the stock to move higher in the near term, our investor conversations signal that there will be a keen focus on delivering the targeted KPIs for the genomics/therapy selection business (e.g., test volume, ASPs, reimbursement, and regulatory updates). In our view, the company has the right menu in place with key tests including xT (solid tumor and DNA test), xF (liquid biopsy test), and xR (solid tumor and RNA test) driving growth over the next several years. These tests serve the large and still underpenetrated therapy selection market, for which we estimate about 2 million patients are eligible for testing in the U.S. today, but is only roughly 30% penetrated. Beyond this, the recent launch of xM minimal residual disease (MRD) test could drive growth in the future.

Longer term, Tempus believes its platform should be leverageable across other disease states outside of oncology. For instance, the company has already launched tests/products in neuropsychiatry, cardiology, and radiology. While in the early innings, we believe this showcases where the company is heading: capturing vast amounts of data that can be used to help further precision medicine, while utilizing AI tools to generate new insights.

As for the stock, we initiate coverage with an Outperform rating. This is based on the massive market opportunity, Tempus's differentiated approach, and a valuation that is reasonable provided the company is able to execute on these targets over the near and intermediate term. While there are risks associated with this thesis—particularly around top-line growth and the importance of driving the business to cash flow breakeven—we believe the risk/reward setup is favorable over the next 12 months, which is the timeframe for our rating.

## Investment Highlights

### Once a Big Idea, Tempus Has Built a Differentiated Business With Meaningful Scale
Founded on the premise that amassing and analyzing healthcare data can result in better products and care for patients, Tempus set out to build a platform that could not only free healthcare data from silos, but also make sense of such data. At its inception, this was a big idea; no player had singularly and internally invested meaningful capital behind this type of business model or been able to successfully achieve the goal. Other players focused more on delivering solutions based on single modalities like blood-based biomarkers or genomic mutations, which admittedly provide value in their own right. Tempus believed this could be improved upon and built the platform to structure, harmonize, and analyze vast amounts of data.

The result was a platform that can combine data from the company's testing laboratories (e.g., DNA and RNA data) with multimodal data from healthcare institutions and associations (e.g., longitudinal clinical notes and imaging and pathology reports). Since inception, the database has amassed roughly 7.7 million clinical records, over 1 million records with imaging data, over 900,000 clinical records linked with genomic information, and more than 220,000 records with full transcriptomic profiles. For oncology, it represents one of the largest and most comprehensive databases ever created. And as we discuss below, it is scalable into other disease states as well.

From the investor standpoint, many have known Tempus for years and at times struggled to see how the long-term economics of this model might work—early margins were negative and cash burn was significant. However, over the last several years, a differentiated business model has emerged as both the genomics and data businesses have scaled. Indeed, the company has a test menu that on the surface mirrors those of peer lab companies, but the differentiation comes in its ability to connect clinical and other healthcare data to the molecular test result.

In doing this, it not only provides contextualized and potentially more accurate or precise reports, but when de-identified, structured, and stored, that data becomes the fuel to improve offerings and create other product lines like data and services, or Algos. Tempus believes this creates network effects: the more data collected, the smarter the tests become, and the more applications that can be developed; in turn, more physicians join the network, growing the database, making the tests smarter and the database more valuable. This is not just about getting a sample in the door and reporting a test out.

## Exhibit 1
### Tempus AI, Inc.
### Tempus Network Effects and Flywheel

(Image of a flywheel diagram showing interconnected concepts)

**Conceptual Flow:**
1.  **Database:** Central repository for data.
2.  **Patients and Physicians:** Contribute "More clinical and genomic data" to the Database.
3.  **More clinical and genomic data:** Feeds into the Database.
4.  **Database:** Fuels "Smarter algorithms."
5.  **Smarter algorithms:** Lead to "More personalized insights."
6.  **More personalized insights:** Improve care for "Patients and Physicians."

*Sources: Company info; William Blair Equity Research*

Differentiation manifests itself across the company's three business lines. Without the genomics business, the Tempus flywheel breaks, as molecular information and inputs are needed to generate insightful takeaways in the database. This is particularly the case in data and services where the company has shown sustained "cohort lifetime value”. This is defined as the cumulative revenue attributable to a specific cohort of de-identified records, including revenue derived from both the initial sequencing (genomics) and licensing and related services (data and services), less the initial sequencing costs incurred to generate the data ultimately licensed. These values continue to grow (even in the very early cohorts, such as those from 2018), highlighting that as the database grows, the usability scales in tandem. We show this in graphic form in exhibit 9, later in the report.

All of this is hard to replicate, especially given the company's head start. Tempus has roughly 500 direct unique data connections across more than 2,000 healthcare institutions, hundreds of provider networks, and 65% of all academic medical centers in the U.S. It also works with industry groups such as the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), the Quality Cancer Care Alliance (QCCA), and the National Cancer Care Alliance (NCCA), whereby Tempus structures and distributes their data. Simply getting access to all of this data is challenging in its own right. But even more challenging is developing an operating system to process that data, which Tempus has done in-house, as opposed to with a partner like several peers have done.

By our estimate, Tempus has deployed well north of $1 billion into this platform over the last nine years and it would take years and significant capital for another player to catch up—at a time where access to investment capital is difficult even for those companies with proven scale already. As a result, we believe Tempus is at the right place, at the right time, and is in a unique position to expand its competitive advantage and moat.

### Initial Market Opportunity in Oncology Remains Massive
Tempus has built an initial foothold in oncology, particularly in the therapy selection market where its xT, xF, and xR tests provide valuable insights to physicians regarding potential treatments and care pathways. In the U.S., we estimate there are roughly 2 million advanced cancer patients who are eligible for NGS-based therapy selection tests, yet this market is only roughly 30% penetrated. Worldwide, Tempus estimates there are about 19.3 million new cancer patients each year, of which only 2.3 million (or 12%) receive any form of NGS-based therapy selection tests. As such, we see a massive runway ahead for Tempus if it can just maintain its current market share (mid-20% share by our estimate in the U.S.).

Moreover, there are opportunities for this market to increase in size as guidelines supporting concurrent testing (i.e., both liquid biopsy and solid tumor testing) expand as they have already done in lung and breast cancers, the potential utility of RNA as a modality becomes more apparent, and MRD and recurrence monitoring become more standard of care. We discuss these below:

*   **Concurrent:** In a JAMA study published in January 2024, it was found that the use of both xT and xF testing in advanced cancer patients (otherwise known as concurrent testing: using both liquid biopsy and tissue based tests) resulted in more actionable variants being detected. This analysis reaffirmed NCCN guidelines for breast and lung cancer that are supportive of concurrent testing. As more data is gathered to determine the benefits of how this approach may improve therapy selection and patient outcomes, it increases the market potential for these tests.
*   **RNA:** By combining both RNA and DNA sequencing, clinical actionability versus DNA sequencing alone has shown to improve. In a poster presented at ASCO in 2022, researchers showed that the addition of RNA sequencing identified 22% of patients with clinically actionable fusions that would have been missed by DNA alone; this represents a 28% increase in the number of patients matched to therapies as compared to those from DNA alone. We believe that if additional studies such as this show similar benefits, it could drive greater utilization of these tests.
*   **Monitoring:** Following surgery or first-line therapy, patients could benefit from monitoring for recurrence of cancer or for MRD during treatment. Tempus believes the 19.3 million annual new cancer patients globally would benefit from multiple tests in the first year after treatment to monitor for recurrence and MRD. Within this newly diagnosed market, Tempus estimates a 50 million annual test volume opportunity with its xM portfolio.

Beyond these market forces, Tempus also is laying the groundwork to expand into important international markets, which appear ripe for test adoption. In particular, the company entered into a joint venture (JV) agreement with SoftBank in May 2024, whereby the JV will work to bring the Tempus platform to the Japanese market to perform clinical sequencing, organize patient data, and build a real-world database.

As part of this agreement, SoftBank made a $200 million investment into Tempus, and both parties contributed to the establishment of the JV, with Tempus providing a license to its IP and dataset, SoftBank providing $100 million in funding. This investment will help launch a laboratory to build a database that can be licensed out and serve as a tool for further development of applications launched in Japan. We like this structure as it allows the team to invest into the Japanese market without incurring significant operating expenses (income/losses associated with the JV will be accounted for below-the-line and excluded from adjusted EBITDA).

### Oncology Is Just the Beginning—Tempus Enters New Arenas and Nears an Inflection Point
The company established its platform first in oncology, given, in part, the natural product-market fit and how advanced the oncology testing space had become. Now that the platform has shown promise, the team believes its technologies can be deployed across different disease states and into AI-based applications.

In particular, the company has ambitions to expand into areas such as neuropsychiatry, radiology, cardiology, and others. However, the goal overarching the efforts across these different end-markets is the same: to make vast amounts of healthcare information accessible and useful, allowing data to be organized and analyzed for the benefit of patients, physicians, and researchers.

Below we summarize efforts in these emerging arenas, and we discuss them further in the "Tempus 101" section below:

*   **Neuropsychiatry:** Launched in 2019, the Tempus nP assay analyzes targets with known roles in pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and immune response to FDA-approved medications. Results are combined in the company's database with clinical, biometric, and patient-reported outcome data (collected through TempusPRO). Over time, this effort may help patients in their journey to the right drug in the right dose, while Algos helps advance R&D efforts with pharma companies. We see this offering and strategy as similar to what Tempus has done in oncology—albeit much earlier.
*   **Cardiology:** Tempus seeks to ingest multimodal data and deploy algorithms to identify potential care gaps and monitor those patients potentially at higher risk. Tempus has also developed an algorithmic model to improve detection of AFib in those patients with normal ECG readings. This algorithm was granted FDA breakthrough status in 2021.
*   **Radiology:** Tempus currently offers more than 50 algorithms and is continuing to develop additional algorithms derived from radiologic images and digital pathology slides.

While we do not believe current valuation underwrites much success on these endeavors in the near term, and investors will want spending and investments to have compelling near- to intermediate-term ROI on these initiatives, we believe there is a path for Tempus to layer on successes and significant growth in the outer years. These opportunities exist in areas with large and underpenetrated TAMs, and we believe Tempus is developing tools that can provide significant clinical utility and have appropriate product-market fit.

### Compelling Financial Narrative: Above Peer-Group Revenue Growth Profile With Line of Sight to Adjusted EBITDA Profitability and Cash Flow Generation
We estimate Tempus to grow above its most direct, publicly traded peer group over the next three years: Tempus at a 34% three-year CAGR from 2023 through 2026, Guardant at 21%, Natera at 22%, and Exact Sciences at 13%. Given the company's scale already, this is impressive and likely warrants valuation to trade at least in line with the midpoint of this group. Tempus today trades at 5.5 times 2025 revenue, versus the group at 5.7 times (more on this in the "Valuation" section).

In our modeling, key drivers of near- and intermediate-term revenue include clinical oncology volume, biopharma sequencing efforts, and conversion of data and services contracts into revenue (while also refilling its book of contracted business). As shown in exhibit 2, clinical oncology ASPs contribute only slightly to total revenue growth over the intermediate term, which we believe could represent an upside driver as Tempus's combined ASP is materially lower than that of peers like Guardant and Foundation Medicine.

With this top-line growth, we believe a profitability and breakeven narrative should emerge. We model Tempus reaching positive adjusted EBITDA in late 2025, with cash flow positivity quickly following in 2026. Unlike other, smaller laboratories that are attempting to reach breakeven, the Tempus model is not driven by major gross margin expansions (we model 440 basis points of expansion over the next three years), operating expense reductions (we model expense growth at a three-year CAGR of 14%), or below-the-line items. Rather, it is more revenue dependent, and as such, we believe the model is more straightforward than some others.

Achieving progress to AEBITDA breakeven or cash flow positivity should be viewed positively in this market backdrop—especially as investors still question the potential to see significant cash flow generation among companies in the space. With our conversations already pointing to sentiment that achieving this is likely to be more challenging, we see upside in the stock if the team can deliver on these estimates.

## Investment Risks

Below we highlight some of the key risks associated with investing in Tempus. This list is not intended to be complete, but rather represents some of the risks that we believe are essential when thinking about this company and the stock.

### Competitive Oncology Diagnostics Market
Tempus is competing with a host of successful companies across therapy selection and recurrence monitoring. Many of these peers have been on market with tests for equal or longer amounts of time. More specific, Tempus competes with Guardant Health, Foundation Medicine (acquired by Roche Holdings), and Caris (private), which we view as the leading players in therapy selection and have similar offerings to xT, xF, and xR. In MRD, the company's main competition today includes Natera (tumor-informed approach) and Guardant (tumor-naïve). Companies such as NeoGenomics, Labcorp, Quest, and Exact Sciences also have or are launching offerings that compete with the Tempus portfolio. We discuss the competitive positioning in greater detail in the "Tempus 101" section below.

Related to competition, on June 11, 2024, Guardant Health filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Tempus. In brief, Guardant is alleging that Tempus infringed on five of its patents related to liquid biopsy sequencing methods and cites the company's xF, xF+, xM Monitor, and xM MRD tests. Guardant is seeking injunctive relief and damages. Tempus has stated that it expects to defend its positioning vigorously, but we view this as a risk to monitor as litigation has been viewed as an overhang for other companies in the space.

### Unproven Scale Expansion Beyond Oncology
The Tempus platform has seen rapid growth over the last several years, primarily from efforts in oncology. However, successes in this field are not necessarily indicative of future successes in other markets in which the company intends to expand—particularly neuropsychiatry, cardiology, and radiology. In our view, not all efforts will need to be successful for the stock to move higher given the long runway ahead in oncology, but if investment levels are heightened toward these expansion areas or if time to success is delayed, it could create some skepticism around platform value. If that is the case, we suspect investors will demand that resources and management efforts be focused more on those areas that have already shown scale and a proper product-market fit, like in oncology.

### Diagnostics Reimbursement Risk
Management has shown a willingness to run tests and collect data without being immediately reimbursed, which has at times been viewed negatively by some in the investment community. With the company receiving payment for roughly 50% of tests completed between January 1, 2021, and December 31, 2022, as of December 31, 2023, we suspect that investors will want to see efforts be deployed to expand reimbursement for the menu and limit the percentage of "zero-pays" moving forward. To that end, while test pricing is not a material driver of revenue growth over the next several years, we do believe it is part of the bull-case scenario and a lever that management should have some control over (especially as it relates to furthering along regulatory approval submissions that, if successful, could further along reimbursement efforts). Therefore, if pricing does not show signs of moving higher over time, we believe this could represent a risk to the investment thesis as genomics margins remain lower than peers and it could contribute further cash outflows greater than expected.

---

### Dual Share Class
There will be two classes of common stock for Tempus, including Class A common stock (each share equals one vote) and Class B common stock (each share equals 30 votes). All shares of Class B stock will be owned by Eric Lefkofsky, CEO, founder, and chairman, resulting in Lefkofsky holding about 65% of the voting power of outstanding shares after the initial public offering. This structure is uncommon for investments in the space and could be viewed negatively.

### LDT Regulation
In May 2024, the U.S. FDA published its final rule on how it intends to regulate laboratory developed tests (LDTs). In July, a four-year phaseout period will begin that requires compliance with multiple rules and is likely to increase regulatory burden across the space. Given that the xT assay has already gone through the FDA premarket approval (PMA) process and other on-market assays are expected to be grandfathered into the rule, Tempus should have the capabilities to meet the FDA's new requirements. However, these regulations could result in additional costs or a removal of a test from the market if the FDA enforces discretion on such tests. In addition, this regulation may result in enforcement or impacts for the company's software products that are connected to LDTs and may result in a longer launch timeline for those products in the pipeline.

### Unionization
In March of this year, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) held an election in which a group of Chicago-based laboratory employees voted to unionize and for the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) to be the group's collective bargaining representative. Tempus has begun negotiating with the IAM to reach a collective bargaining agreement, which may result in incremental cost and expense for the company. If an agreement is not reached or it takes longer than anticipated to reach an agreement, this could lead to these laboratory employees going on strike and stopping work, which could lead to longer turnaround times and higher labor costs as a result. We believe our estimates account for higher expenses related to this update, though this does represent some risk as costs could be higher with an unfavorable outcome.

### Significant Cash Burn
In 2023, the company posted operational cash burn of about $250 million. Although we expect that to improve to $202 million in 2024, we do not model the company reaching cash flow positivity until 2026. The company's public offering should provide enough cushion to reach breakeven, but we recognize that revenue growth, gross margin expansion, and operating expense discipline have the possibility to miss expectations. Missing expectations would prolong and increase the burn, and in an environment where pathway to profitability has come front and center for investors, negative surprises could exert downward pressure on shares and sour investor sentiment.

## Tempus 101: An Introduction to the Platform and Products

Tempus was founded in 2015 with the primary goal of building a platform to bring the power of technology to healthcare and diagnostics, creating better tests and reports that are more accurate, tailored, and personalized for each patient—what Tempus calls "intelligent diagnostics". To do this, the company built a data platform that connects, structures, and makes sense of clinical data flowing from electronic health records (EHRs), for example, testing molecular data from the company's sequencing efforts, and other forms of data that can help guide a patient to the right therapy at the right time. Tempus first focused its efforts in oncology, but has since expanded into other areas, such as neuropsychology, radiology, and cardiology, where its respective products and services remain in the early innings of uptake and are not yet part of the near-term investment thesis.

---

The result of these efforts, and the platform, is the formation of one of the largest libraries of clinical and molecular oncology data in the world. This database can be used to further improve patient care, by providing smarter diagnostics outputs for physicians, while also providing access to critical real-world data that can help pharmaceutical and biotech companies discover and develop drugs potentially faster and more efficiently. Longer term, the data can be used to train models to improve diagnostic accuracy or minimize care gaps in patient delivery.

To better understand how Tempus is differentiated versus others in its field, we believe it is important to first provide a brief overview on the platform, its three product lines, and how each of these builds off one another. We then discuss emerging areas of the business (neuropsychiatry) that we believe could be part of the longer-term investment thesis.

### The Tempus Platform
The mission of Tempus is to "help make sure patients are on the right drug at the right time, so they can live longer and healthier lives”. But in order to advance this, and even before providing products and services to customers, Tempus first built a technology platform that sought to free and collect healthcare data from the many silos in patient care (EHR data, clinical notes, routine and molecular lab tests, images, demographic data, longitudinal follow-up data, etc.).

At the most basic level, this platform established software capabilities and data pipelines in which raw data is ingested from physicians' EHRs, associations, and Tempus's labs, and into the company's operating system. This is further aided through workflow tools such as Hub, where physicians interact with the platform. To date, more than 500 unique data collections exist across more than 2,000 healthcare institutions that share data directly with Tempus. After receiving the data and de-identifying it, Tempus does have the rights to this data and the ability to commercialize it.

These integrations are established through either commercial efforts (physicians ordering tests or participating in trial matching services) in which data is needed to enable the delivery of test results or matching, or through research/association partnerships. On the latter, Tempus works with groups such as ASCO, QCCA, and NCCA, whereby Tempus structures and distributes their data.

Due to the many data silos that exist across patient care, data comes to Tempus in many different forms, types, and structures (text, images, molecules, etc.). Tempus focuses most on categories such as clinical, molecular, and imaging data. Selected data modalities include DNA, RNA, epigenetics, organoids, imaging, EMR, clinical notes, lab tests, single cell, patient-reported outcomes, pathology, and proteomics. In addition, the company also sometimes collects longitudinal follow-up data when and where it exists. This follow-up data is highly valuable as providers and drug companies can look at real-world cohorts and outcomes, potentially furthering care and/or hypotheses on treatment paths. To date, the company has amassed over 5.7 million de-identified patient records.

Tempus having access to some of this data is a significant hurdle. But being able to process and make sense of this amount of data furthers along its competitive advantage. Here, the company deploys proprietary technologies, AI, and individuals to organize these records into standardized formats, curating and structuring the raw data that has been ingested.

Once complete, the data can be used to fuel product lines, such as further contextualizing patient results (genomics), adding to the de-identified patient database that can be mined/analyzed by life science companies (data and services), or used by Tempus to train AI models for additional products (Algos). Exhibit 3, on the following page, shows how the product lines are interconnected.

In other words, the platform is a key differentiator for Tempus, providing the backbone for its efforts across all product lines. Without the platform, the company would not be able to amass such large quantities of clinical data, make sense and help draw insights from those datasets, or be used to develop further advances longer term. Rather, data would remain siloed and fragmented approaches would continue.

Exhibit 4 helps summarize how the operating system and platform work together.

### First Product Line: Genomics
The genomics product line is most akin to other specialty labs we cover—running tests that are used in different disease areas and reporting out those test results to physicians. These tests are generally reimbursed through insurance companies, providers such as hospitals, patients, or biopharma companies that use these services.

In comparison, Tempus's lab tests are linked to clinical data and outcomes, further contextualizing the lab results for patients in the form of intelligent diagnostics. In addition, the company uses the product line to not only collect data from customers (as a covered entity) but also to marry datasets together to drive growth in data and services, as well as in AI applications.

Said different, genomics acts as somewhat of a "hook" for Tempus to generate and collect the highly valuable molecular data that is necessary to build the database and expand efforts into other product lines. We view this as a critical point in the Tempus investment thesis. Rather than focusing the majority of efforts on the service side of genomics (i.e., receiving sample, running tests, reporting out), Tempus uses genomics as a means to generate molecular data. As a result, we view the business model as somewhat differentiated versus other sequencing players that favor more of the traditional service model as opposed to the data-based model.

---

The company's first efforts began in oncology, for which the majority of genomics revenue is derived today (over 85%). Since its launch, over 800,000 oncology NGS samples have been sequenced, genomics revenue excluding COVID sales has increased at an 80% compound annual rate since 2020 and more than 7,000 physicians have used the offerings in some way. This has allowed the company to connect with more than 50% of the 13,000-plus U.S. oncologists. Sales are supported by about 230 direct sales representatives and the company touts a 92% 12-month retention metric once a physician has placed more than 25 orders.

The oncology test menu is comprehensive: spanning solid tumors and hematologic malignancies, germline and somatic variants, and tissue and liquid biopsies. This fulsome menu provides clinicians with comprehensive genomic profiling to generate insights (similar to sequencing peers), while also contributing to the database.

In terms of core tests, we highlight xT, xR, xF, and xM, and discuss these in more detail below.

*   **xT:** The first test launched in 2017, xT is a 648 gene solid tumor assay that detects actionable targets in oncology through the sequencing of tumor tissue samples. The test was approved by the FDA in April 2023 as a companion diagnostic test (xT CDx) for colorectal cancer patients and has an estimated nine-day turnaround time following specimen retrieval.
*   **xR:** This solid tumor whole transcriptome RNA assay was previously paired with xT and xE, but as of January 2023, it is offered as a standalone test with a roughly 10-day turnaround time. The majority of the company's oncology algorithmic tests are based on xR. The company is seeking FDA approval for this test and has planned regulatory submissions for an upgraded version of the assay.
*   **xF:** Launched in 2018, this 105 gene liquid biopsy assay for solid tumor cancers is used for the detection of oncogenic and resistance mutations from peripheral blood samples. An expanded version of the test named xF+, is a 523 gene liquid biopsy assay. Turnaround time is estimated to be about 7 days from specimen retrieval, while xF+ is about 10 days following specimen retrieval. The company intends to bring xF+ through the FDA approval process over the coming years.
*   **xM:** Launched in 2024, xM represents a portfolio of tumor-naïve and tumor-informed (offered through partnership with Personalis) molecular residual disease tests. Currently, the tumor-naïve assay is intended for stage II-III colorectal cancer patients, while the tumor-informed assay is for stage IA-IIIB NSCLC and stage II-III breast cancer patients.

In addition to these core tests, the company's offerings include whole exome (xE) and hereditary cancer risk (xG). We list and describe the entire oncology test offering in exhibit 5. It should be noted that the performance of these tests is on par with those of competitors, and we do not believe test performance versus others is a major differentiator either positively or negatively.

Differentiation versus competitors is most readily apparent to physicians in how Tempus reports results. Because the company connects molecular results to clinical data, thus contextualizing the report to individual patients, a "smart report" can be made. This has several benefits, including: 1) easy to interpret results based on actionable molecular findings; 2) therapy options, which leverage key guideline bodies like OncoKB or NCCN; 3) insights into potential therapy resistance by combining clinical and molecular datasets; 4) clinical trial options; and 5) a patient's clinical history. We show this in exhibit 6, on the following page.

---

## Exhibit 6

### Sample XT Report

(Image of a sample xT report with sections for Diagnosis, Genomic Variants, Immunotherapy Markers, Clinical Trials, and FDA-Approved Therapies)

**Potential Benefits of Smart Report**

1.  **Easy to interpret results:** actionable molecular findings
2.  **Therapy options:** leverages OncoKB and NCCN guidelines
3.  **Therapy resistance:** clinical and molecular data provides insight
4.  **Clinical trial options:** increased odds of matching
5.  **Clinical history:** captured within the report

*Sources: Company website; William Blair Equity Research*

This combination of data has shown benefits. In 2019, a 500-patient study published in Nature Bio (link) showed that when sequencing results were matched with clinical data, roughly 96% of patients could be matched to at least one clinical trial. This compared to just 77% based on sequencing alone, thus showing a 19% lift in matching based on clinical data alone.

On the competitive front in oncology, there are several large players who also have offerings in the therapy selection field. Key competitors here, in our view, include Guardant Health, Foundation Medicine (acquired by Roche in 2018), and Caris (private). In addition, companies such as NeoGenomics, Exact Sciences, Natera, Myriad Genetics, and Haystack Oncology have offerings that compete with some or all of the Tempus oncology portfolio. In exhibit 7, we show several of these competitor tests and where they compete with the Tempus menu.

Beyond the core clinical oncology franchise in genomics, the product line also records revenue from sequencing services performed in a research capacity for pharmaceutical companies. This service is more similar to the work other specialty labs do in this realm—sequencing samples for research, clinical trial work, or companion diagnostic development. In 2023, this contributed 12% of total genomics revenue.

Lastly, and as we discuss in the "Emerging Opportunities" section of this report, the company is working to drive further adoption of tests in other fields including neuropsychiatry and infectious diseases. We believe advancements in the neuropsychiatry portfolio are likely to advance faster commercially given the 2019 launch of the nP test for pharmacogenomic profiling for patients with psychiatric conditions such as depression. Efforts here are further along than those in infectious disease, where the company used its testing infrastructure to run 2.8 million COVID tests during the pandemic, but for which the company has shifted resources away and is now focusing on broader respiratory pathogen testing.

### Second Product Line: Data and Services
Tempus has not simply just amassed vast quantities of clinical, molecular, and imaging data, but it has also structured it into a usable database for which insights can be made and hypotheses tested. This, when combined with the longitudinal nature of the data, allows for real-world data to help inform both physicians and researchers alike.

The data and services segment makes use of this database, providing tools to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies who find this data extremely valuable in their research and development efforts. Through these efforts, Tempus works with 19 of the top 20 oncology pharma companies and has multiyear strategic partnerships with 6 of the top 10 oncology pharma companies. Key partners include GSK, AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Bristol Myers Squibb, Eli Lilly, and Recursion.

Combined, customers have signed contracts for which the remaining total contract value (TCV)—defined as total potential future value to be recognized from signed contracts, assuming the exercise of all contract options and all discretionary opt-ins, and no early termination—equates to over $920 million at the end of 2023, inclusive of $300 million of potential contractual opt-ins.

---

These contracts give line of sight to future revenue for the product line, and management intends to report the remaining TCV annually, providing color into new contract wins and recognition of revenue from these contracts during the period.

While portions of the remaining TCV can be satisfied through purchase of any of the company's products and services (like genomics), we model cumulative data and services revenue of $996 million from the beginning of 2024 through the end of 2026. This inherently implies that we expect additional contracts to be signed, utilization of services to expand, and for the product line to have durability beyond just the here and now. As more data gets put into the database, the value to customers should also grow. That said, we believe investors will be focused on how/when contracts are renegotiated, as some of these larger earlier contracts come back up for bidding.

Data and services comprise two products: Insights (70% of segment revenue; 22% of total revenue in 2023) and Trials (27% and 9%, respectively). We discuss these in greater depth below.

### Insights
Through this offering, Tempus sells access to its database. This includes uses that can be either focused or broad, such as exploring the database (asking questions of the entire Tempus database), subscribing to the database (rent records for analysis from defined cohorts of interest), or licensing (download focused cohorts for analysis). This results in customers—primarily pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies—paying Tempus a per file fee or signing multiyear data licensing agreements.

This data is useful for oncology drug development as it can help inform decisions on a variety of discovery and development applications. These applications include discovery (uncover new targets, identify biomarkers of relevance), clinical development (prioritize indications using response signatures, develop CDx strategy), and commercialization (trial design, label expansion).

In an effort to further provide glimpses into use-cases and applicability of the products, in exhibit 8, we provide another example of how Tempus's Insights product can be used to improve discovery efforts. We note this is based off of case studies shown on the company's website (link).

## Exhibit 8
### Tempus AI, Inc.
### Example of Insights Use-Case

| | |
| :---------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Description** | A Translational Medicine and Biomarker Discovery team from a large pharma company approached Tempus to determine if an analysis of real-world molecular data, DNA and RNA sequencing, and clinical data of de-identified pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) would help accelerate target discovery. |
| **Results and Analysis** | A real-world dataset with over 2,000 records of patients with diagnosed PDAC was evaluated and 942 samples were selected for analysis. This analysis resulted in a number of gene targets that were lowly expressed in normal tissue but highly expressive in pancreatic cancer samples. |
| **Outcomes** | Several hundred potential targets for drug discovery were identified through this analysis and the pharma company team is working to assess and validate these targets to determine whether or not these targets can become candidate genes for future drug development. |

Once again, Insights is another example of how Tempus can continue to grow as its database does. In other words, Tempus creates value over time from the efforts it makes to ingest, structure, and harmonize data. This is differentiated versus laboratory testing peers and is readily apparent through the Insights platform.

Shown in exhibit 9, the cohort lifetime value is defined as the cumulative revenue attributable to a specific cohort of de-identified records, including revenue derived from both the initial sequencing (genomics) and licensing and related services (data and services), less the initial sequencing costs incurred to generate the data ultimately licensed. Tempus continues to see cohort lifetime value increase years after initial sequencing was done on samples, making this a differentiated aspect of its business model. We continue to expect lifetime values to increase over time, as once again, the database grows and the usability scales in tandem, though likely at a faster rate.

### Trials
Through Tempus's wide network of physicians, as well as its database, it is well positioned to assist in matching and enrolling patients in clinical trials. The Trials platform leverages this infrastructure to more rapidly connect patients with trial sponsors. Genomic and clinical data act as filters for potential enrollment criteria, and through this platform, Tempus can also help physicians "turn on" their office as an enrollment site. In turn, the company generates revenue from both matching the patient to the trial and from the patient actually enrolling in the trial.

Since its launch in 2019, the matching offering has been used across more than 230 clinical trials and has identified more than 30,000 patients as potentially eligible for enrollment in unique trials. In addition, research has shown that it can take 6 to 12 months to initiate a new trial site for an ongoing clinical trial in the U.S., whereas Trials from Tempus has shown activation can completed be within 2 weeks. This time advantage is highly valuable to pharmaceutical customers, especially those seeking to identify hard-to-find or underserved patient populations.

Beyond the matching service, Tempus also has its own CRO service offering named Tempus Compass. This business was acquired in 2022 (formerly named Highline Consulting, LLC) and acts as a full-service CRO with capabilities across trial design through regulatory and post approval services.

---

### Third Product Line: AI Applications (or Algos)
Through its vast data collection and structuring efforts, Tempus has begun to leverage its datasets to develop new tools that can further help patients and providers direct appropriate care. Through its Next platform, the company has created a suite of care gap algorithms that can help physicians identify gaps in care, be alerted, and take action. To date, Next has been deployed across oncology, cardiology, and radiology through algorithmic-based diagnostics, software as a medical device, and clinical decision support tools. We expect the company to further collect routine data across other disease states in the future, which could lead to further expansion over time.

Below, we discuss how Algos is manifesting itself across the three key disease states. We note that efforts here remain in the early innings, and we do not believe these are major points of the near-term investment thesis. Rather, this could act as another shot on goal for longer-term growth.

### Oncology
Tempus has launched four clinically validated algorithmic-based diagnostics in oncology, most of which are offered through the xR assay, and over time these are likely to be connected to the Next suite. We highlight these tests in exhibit 10, noting that over 58,000 oncology Algos have been ordered to date (roughly 7% of the total oncology volume since launch) though these are not billed separately and generate little to no revenue.

## Exhibit 10
### Tempus AI, Inc.
### Select Oncology Algos

| Test | Launch | Description |
| :-------------------------------------- | :----- | :---------- |
| **Tumor Origin (TO)** | 2021 | Used with the xR assay, this algorithm helps predict site of origin when the primary tumor site is unknown. In 2023, this was ordered on roughly 10% of solid tumor profiles. |
| **Homologous Recombination Deficiency (HRD)** | 2020 | DNA-based algorithmic test that can be used in all major cancer subtypes to determine a patient's HRD status. This determines a patient's sensitivity to PARP inhibitors and/or platinum-based chemotherapy. |
| **Dihydropyrimidine Dehydrogenase Deficiency (DPYD)** | 2021 | Utilizes sequencing data generated from a separately run xT test and looks for alterations in the DPYD gene that may be associated with potential toxicity to a certain type of chemotherapy. Used most commonly in colorectal, breast, pancreatic, and GI cancers. |
| **Purist™** | 2023 | Algorithm that determines subtype for patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC). Subtypes include basal-like (worse prognosis and less likely to benefit from a certain therapy) and classical. |

*Source: Company filings*

Beyond these tests, Tempus Next is also assisting in directing the care pathway for cancer patients. Active at 18 health systems across 80 hospitals, Tempus Next in oncology identifies and tracks patients in their care journey and relative to standard of care, while also screening for patients who may be indicated for diagnostics, therapies, clinic visits, or referrals but for whom action has not yet been taken. Notifications can then be sent to patients or physicians, alerting them of these potential care gaps. Further, Next remains up to date with ever-evolving guidelines, assisting providers in managing the complexities of these updates.

### Cardiology
Tempus has developed and continues to refine several tools and algorithmic-based tests across cardiology. Most notable is the company's atrial fibrillation test (AFib), which received FDA breakthrough designation in March 2021 and was launched in a clinical trial setting in 2023. This algorithmic-based test seeks to more accurately predict major cardiac trauma and stroke risk from

---

normal ECG results. About 3.5% of patients who receive 12-lead ECGs (electrocardiogram) appearing to not have AFib in fact do develop the condition or a similar condition within one year. Tempus believes this test can better define risk for these patients with a normal result. This test was trained on roughly 3.5 million ECGs (700,000 patients) with decades of longitudinal data.

Beyond this test, the company is working to develop Algos to predict aortic stenosis, low ejection fraction, and familial hypercholesterolemia.

### Radiology
Tempus is also working to develop algorithms and software to improve insights from radiological images. Tempus Pixel is a product that supports more consistent and rapid assessments from images, assisting in topics such as therapy response evaluation, better analysis across screening and detection, and tracking of images. Much of the workflow in radiology is manually based today, but Tempus believes Pixel can better help in automating some of this workflow and allow for better results. The company acquired Arterys in 2022, which helps derive insights from radiologic images and served as the launch pad for the company's entrance into this segment of the market.

### Emerging Opportunities: Neuropsychiatry
Through its learnings in oncology, in 2019 Tempus began work on leveraging its platform for use-cases in psychiatric conditions such as depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and other mental illnesses. Seeing parallels between oncology and neuropsychiatry—wherein both conditions have unique, heterogenous patient populations that are sometimes prescribed drugs based on trial and error—the team believed that offering a pharmacogenomic profiling test, coupled with collecting EHR and patient-reported outcome data, could build a valuable database to fuel advancements over time.

Launched in 2019, the Tempus nP assay uses MALDI-TOF technology to analyze 80 single nucleotide and indel variants in the 13 validated genes with known roles in pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and immune response to FDA-approved medications. These results are then combined in the company's database with clinical, biometric, and patient-reported outcome data, which are collected through TempusPRO, a patient-facing mobile app that gathers outcome measures on a continual basis.

Management believes that over time, this data should be able to assist in getting patients on the right drug and dosage, and also further advancements in R&D efforts from pharma companies. In addition, it believes this platform could be used to support work in other neurologic conditions such as depression, Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, ALS, and multiple sclerosis.

## Summary Physician Feedback

In this section, we paraphrase what we believe is the most interesting feedback from several physician interviews we conducted.

### Test Menu
(+) Tempus has a complete portfolio of tests and test performance is considered to be comparable with peers.
(+) Sending the samples required for the xF and xT tests together allows for a faster result (9 days for xF, 10-11 days for xT) and enables the patient to begin therapy earlier than if the two tests were run separately (could be anywhere from 25 to 30 days if there are other workflow challenges).

---

(+/-) Generally, physicians prioritize turnaround time, electronic medical record integration, and customer service, all of which Tempus can deliver on but is also offered by some of its larger and more well-known competitors. One physician said Guardant had the best service for his institution.
(-) With multiple tests offered in the portfolio, physicians find it confusing at times as to what tests should be ordered.

### Smart Report
(+) The report is crisp, clean, and simple, and puts all of the information oncologists need to know at the beginning. It was described as easy to read, whereas some peers put information in the back of the report.
(+) Integration with a health system's electronic health record (EHR) allows for a patient's treatment history to be included in the report. This is nice to have and creates stickiness.
(-) Some physicians find that they just need the test result and can make decisions on therapies without the additional information in the report.

### Trials
(+) Creates a stickiness with health systems as it provides great benefits with matching patients to trials by reducing costs and saving time.
(+) Trials platform allows for smaller institutions to be able to activate clinical trials quickly, allowing for patients to get access to therapies faster, creating further stickiness to Tempus.
(-) Eligibility and matching of patients for clinical trials may not be practical in all settings and therefore not useful to all providers.

### Differentiation of Tempus
(+) Being able to utilize one vendor, like Tempus, makes it an easier, faster, better coordinated, and more seamless process for the hospital.
(+) Overlay of additional algorithms on Tempus' tests allow physicians to get a clearer picture of genetic mutations and what therapy response may look like.
(+) The Next platform allows for institutions to close care gaps with patients and helps to ensure patients are receiving guideline-recommended tests.

### Emerging Use-Cases (Concurrent Testing, MRD, RNA)
(+) RNA offering is comprehensive and several years ahead of other competitors, such as Foundation Medicine.
(-) There was a fear that getting payers to reimburse for concurrent testing may be an uphill battle, as payers are used to only having to pay for a solid tumor or a liquid biopsy test.
(+/-) While the MRD offering was missing from the portfolio and is several years behind other competitors, it has recently been added with tumor-informed and tumor-naïve capabilities.

## Financial Overview

### Revenue
Tempus derives revenue from across its three product lines: genomics, data and services, and AI applications. For SEC reporting purposes, however, revenue is disaggregated based on just the first two, with revenue from AI applications being recorded in the data and services line, given that it remains immaterial at this point (1% of total revenue in 2023). The majority of revenue is generated in North America, and the company did not break out international sales in its S-1.

As shown in exhibit 12, revenue has grown rapidly over the last several years, and we expect growth to continue at a fast clip, estimating total company revenue growing at a five-year compound annual rate of 38% from 2021 through 2026. By segment, genomics revenue is expected to post a 34% CAGR over that time, though this includes some revenue associated with COVID-19 testing efforts. Excluding this, the CAGR is 53%. Similarly, data and services has also grown rapidly, and we estimate a 47% CAGR over the same timeframe.

---

Looking forward, we estimate total revenue of $690 million in 2024, $950 million in 2025, and $1.27 billion in 2026. This represents core growth of 30%, 38%, and 34%, respectively, over that timeframe and represents a three-year CAGR of 34% from 2023 through 2026.

| **2026E** | $835 | $435 | $1,270 | |

*Sources: Company filings; William Blair Equity Research*

### Genomics
Revenue from the genomics segment largely includes sales from performing diagnostics testing for physicians, pharma and biotech companies, and other third parties. We estimate this line by combining sales from clinical oncology testing and other genomics, which includes sales of sequencing products and services to pharma and research entities. Clinical oncology is forecast to grow at a 33% compound annual rate and other genomics is forecast to grow at a 25% compound annual rate from 2023 through 2026. We will focus more on the clinical oncology modeling for this report given its larger mix of the entire segment (roughly 90% of the total genomics line over the next three years).

Genomics revenue is recognized when reports are delivered, and the dollar amount recorded per test is based on contracted amounts (for direct bill) or at anticipated reimbursement levels (for insurers) based on standard charges less any variable considerations like contractual allowance or price concessions. It also accounts for historical collections in relation to established rates, as well as current or anticipated reimbursement trends.

The way we model clinical oncology genomics revenue is largely straightforward: price times volume. On the pricing side of things, the company has seen improvements in ASPs over the last several quarters, due to broadening NGS coverage decisions across the landscape, the introduction of an RNA CPT code in January 2023 (previously, xT had been running both a DNA and RNA sequence; now xR is ordered, ran, and billed separately), and recent progress with commercial payer coverage. This led to modeled ASPs increasing 59% in 2023 versus 2022. Still, as of December 2023,

---

between January 2021 and December 2022, the company received payment across all payers on about 50% of its clinical oncology NGS tests. We see room for further upside to reimbursement over time.

Looking forward, initiatives to improve reimbursement remain underway. These include additional MolDx coverage decisions and FDA approvals for xF and xR, which would qualify the test for Medicare reimbursement under existing NCDs and likely spur private payer coverage decisions.

In our model, total clinical ASPs are assumed to decrease 4% in 2024, before growing 3% and 2% in 2025 and 2026, respectively. The decrease in 2024 is driven by the launch of the company's xM MRD assay, which, despite volume being metered to minimize overall ASP impacts, will still likely have a modest drag overall.

With pricing relatively flat over the forecast period, volume is the main driver of clinical oncology growth. Here, we forecast volumes to expand by 32%, 34%, and 32% over the next three years, respectively. This is driven by continued market penetration in therapy selection (a market that we estimate to be roughly 30% penetrated), the potential impact from concurrent testing guidelines, efforts to drive new account wins and increased utilization, and new test launches. While we do not model volumes by test or payer type, historically, about 25% of clinical volumes have been xF and roughly 25% of clinical volumes come from Medicare.

Beyond the clinical oncology business, we expect other genomics-related revenue to grow at a 25% three-year compound annual rate, though off of a smaller base.

---

### Data and Services Revenue
Segment revenue includes sales from licensing de-identified data to pharma and biotech companies (Insights) and AI-enabled clinical trial matching (Trials). In addition, AI applications revenue has historically been reported in the company's data and services revenue line item, though this is immaterial at roughly 1% of total revenue in 2023.

In total, we forecast data and services to grow at a three-year compound annual rate of 37% from 2023 through 2026, while noting visibility into quarterly trends and remaining TCV conversion timing is likely challenging from an intermediate- to long-term modeling perspective. We do note segment revenue is typically second-half-weighted due to budgeting cycles of relevant customers. Second-half revenue has averaged roughly 60% of full-year data and services revenue over the past two years.

By product line, we believe Insights should represent about 70% of total segment revenue moving forward. Sales from Insights includes the licenses of libraries and analytical data tools, with several access options: explore, subscription, and data licensing.

For the Trials business, revenue is generated when patients are matched to trials and when the patients actually enroll in trials. Fees charged in this business are often fixed and based on each match, per enrollment.

### Gross Margin
Cost of revenue as a percentage of sales is expected to be higher for genomics than it is for data and services, due to several factors, including reimbursement trends and input costs.

For gross margins specifically in genomics, we model the introduction of new assays in clinical oncology to drag on genomics gross margin in 2024 before slightly expanding moving forward (similar to ASPs). This does not account for significant reimbursement wins (impacting pricing and margins), nor does it include any major decreases in costs associated with sequencing. While the company does plan to convert sequencing efforts to the NovaSeq X over time for some of its assays, we do not model a major margin uptick from those efforts. We model gross margin for genomics to be 47% in 2024, 49% in 2025, and 50% in 2026.

For data and services, costs of revenue primarily consist of royalty fees, cloud expenses, and some allocated overhead. We expect licensing gross margins to be roughly 75% and trials gross margins to be about 40% given the more manual nature of that service. We model gross margin for data and services to see continued improvement from 2023 levels of 67% to 71% in 2024, 73% in 2025, and 74% in 2026.

In total, we forecast gross margin at the total company level to be 55% in 2024, 57% in 2025, and 58% in 2026.

### Operating Expenses
We forecast total operating expenses of $542 million in 2024, $614 million in 2025, and $710 million in 2026. This compares to $482 million in 2023, and by respective year totals, accounts for 79%, 65%, and 56% of total revenue. Key drivers of spend include those listed below.

### Research and Development
We expect the company to incur R&D operating expenses associated with the development of new genomics assays, for both existing and new disease areas. We forecast R&D expenses of $102 million in 2024, $116 million in 2025, and $145 million in 2026.

---

### Technology Research and Development
This expense is connected to the development of Tempus's platform, applications, and new products (such as algorithms) that the company anticipates bringing to market. We forecast technology R&D expenses of $110 million in 2024, $125 million in 2025, and $150 million in 2026.

### Selling, General, and Administrative
SG&A encompasses primarily personnel costs for the company's sales representatives, executives, accounting, legal, and human resources staff. As of June 2024, the company has roughly 2,300 employees, consisting of roughly 280 sales representatives in the genomics and data and services segments (split 230 and 50, respectively).

We forecast SG&A expenses of $331 million in 2024, $373 million in 2025, and $415 million in 2026, consistently increasing as the company grows in scale and requires more personnel across multiple divisions.

### Adjusted EBITDA
We expect Tempus to disclose adjusted EBITDA in its financials moving forward. Add-backs are consistent with peers and include: 1) stock-based compensation, 2) interest expense associated with the Google note and Ares term loan, 3) depreciation, 4) amortization, and 5) settlement costs. Based on our modeling, we see the company reaching AEBITDA positivity in the fourth quarter of 2025 and achieving full-year positivity in 2026.

### Balance Sheet
As of June 30, 2024, our model estimates $535 million in cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet. This includes $372 million in net proceeds from the IPO and recently completed private fundraising rounds, including: preferred series G-3 (roughly $90 million) in April 2022; Ares term loan (about $260 million) in September 2022, April 2023, and October 2023; preferred series G-4 ($45 million) in October 2023; and preferred series G-5 in May 2024 ($200 million), which was completed as part of the launch of the joint venture in Japan with Softbank.

As for debt, the company had roughly $450 million outstanding on the balance sheet as of the end of 2023, comprised of the company's Google Convertible Promissory Note and Ares Capital Term Loan Facility. Regarding the Google Convertible Promissory Note, this was entered in June 2020 in conjunction with Tempus's agreement to use Google's Cloud Platform. At issuance, the outstanding principal value was $330 million, though this was reduced in November 2020 in connection with an $80 million convertible stock financing with Google and has since been reduced further as the principal is reduced annually based on a formula taking into account the aggregate value of the Google Cloud Platform services used by Tempus (thus, only $193 million is outstanding on the balance sheet in December 2023). This note matures in March 2026, and Google has the option to convert the outstanding principal plus interest accrued into shares of common stock.

Separately, the company also has a credit agreement with Ares. This loan matures in September 2027, and Tempus is required to maintain revenue of $459 million in 2024 and $594 million in 2025 per the agreement.

In our model, we forecast ending cash balances of $486 million in 2024, $444 million in 2025, and $460 million in 2026, which makes us comfortable with cash needs until the company hits profitability, which we assume in 2026.

## Valuation Metrics and Conclusions

After the listing of Tempus's common shares on the Nasdaq on June 14, 2024, at an initial price of $37.00 per share, the stock has traded down 20% and is trading at $30.88 per share. This represents an enterprise value of about 5.5 times our 2025 revenue forecast of $950 million, and an enterprise value of about 4.1 times our 2026 revenue forecast of $1.27 billion.

While we concede that valuation on this business is more of an art than a science, investors we have spoken with have nearly all focused on the specialty lab peer group—in particular Guardant Health, Natera, and Exact Sciences, which are all viewed as pioneers in their respective fields and also have large TAMs (liquid biopsy therapy selection, MRD, and CRC screening, respectively). As shown in exhibit 17, this group trades at an average multiple of 5.7 times 2025 revenue, a slight premium (3%) to Tempus.

In our view, this multiple is fair for several reasons: 1) Tempus has an expected higher revenue growth rate versus the group over the forecast period (34% versus the peer group at 19%, on average); 2) unlike the case with Guardant, Tempus does not have a perceived near-term overhang due to the upcoming launch of a potentially dilutive endeavor (Shield CRC); and 3) we believe the data and services business should hold a slightly higher multiple than the genomics business given its software-like margins over time (75% gross margins for Insights) and the competitive position it enjoys with its first-mover advantage and difficult-to-replicate internal platform.

Stock ratings and valuation methodologies: William Blair & Company, L.L.C. uses a three-point system to rate stocks. Individual ratings reflect the expected performance of the stock relative to the broader market (generally the S&P 500, unless otherwise indicated) over the next 12 months. The assessment of expected performance is a function of near-, intermediate-, and long-term company fundamentals, industry outlook, confidence in earnings estimates, valuation (and our valuation methodology), and other factors. Outperform (O) - stock expected to outperform the broader market over the next 12 months; Market Perform (M) - stock expected to perform approximately in line with the broader market over the next 12 months; Underperform (U) - stock expected to underperform the broader market over the next 12 months; not rated (NR) - the stock is not currently rated. The valuation methodologies include (but are not limited to) price-to-earnings multiple (P/E), relative P/E (compared with the relevant market), P/E-to-growth-rate (PEG) ratio, market capitalization/revenue multiple, enterprise value/EBITDA ratio, discounted cash flow, and others.
