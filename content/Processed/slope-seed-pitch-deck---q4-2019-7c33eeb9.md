## Slide 1: Title Slide
# Slope
Data-driven clinical trial supply chain management.
Rust Felix · Co-Founder & CEO
(251) 300 - 7390 • rust@slope.io

## Slide 2: Problem
Trial Sponsors lose hundreds of millions of dollars because their supply chains are too complex for people to manage.

**Trial Vendors**
Drug, device, kit, and supply distribution is reactive.

**Research Sites**
No systems exist to help sites manage inventory & orders.

**Study Patients**
There's no easy way to forecast patient inventory requirements.

**Analytical Labs**
Ensuring samples end up at the right labs requires lots of PM.

**? Questionable Clinical Data**

94% of clinical trials are delayed more than a month. Delays cost $600K to $8M per day.

## Slide 3: Solution
So we built the first connected clinical supply chain management platform that ensures everyone knows where everything is.

**Before Slope: Inaccurate forecasts cause study delays.**
*   Sponsors, CROs, and Vendors don't have visibility into clinical inventory usage at trial sites.
*   So spreadsheet models and simulations are relied on for both demand forecasting and PM.
*   Site demand isn't balanced with vendor supply. Patients are impacted & studies are delayed.

**With Slope: Data powers supply chain automation.**
*   Sites use Slope to manage their inventory, ensuring they have what they need for trial patients.
*   ClinOps teams are connected to this data in real-time. Site data powers resupply automation.
*   Vendors improve distribution accuracy with better inventory mgmt. and resupply workflows.

## Slide 4: Traction, Feedback, & Analytics
### WHERE WE ARE TODAY:
*   $2.6M TCV of clinical trials launched Q4 2019.
*   $4M+ TCV of trials launching in 2020.
*   ~$9M TCV in deployments scheduled for next 18-24 mo.
*   7 paid clinical trials with channel partners.
*   875 clinical stakeholders using our platform.

### FEEDBACK FROM PLATFORM USERS:
"I am super impressed by Slope – they are focused on all of the right things. Slope is dedicated to sites and making their job easier."
– Gabe Garcia / Clinical Research Coordinator, New England Cancer Specialists

"Slope has significantly reduced our inventory burden and has made our studies much easier to conduct."
– Karen Arrington / VP, Clinical Operations, Cancer Insight

"Slope has been a critical partner in Andwin's pipeline growth and success. Their unique technology advantage helps me close faster.”
– Andrew Billimore / VP, Commercial Ops, Andwin Scientific

### ANALYTICS
| Metric                          | Value      |
| :------------------------------ | :--------- |
| Clinical Inventory & Assets Managed | 135K+      |
| Clinical Trials Managed On our Platform | 2.1K+      |

## Slide 5: Product Overview
Slope is the only solution that accurately load balances the clinical supply chain with real-time patient data.

**Core Platform Features (Center Column):**
*   Inventory Mgmt.
*   Resupply Workflows
*   Dashboards
*   Approvals
*   Systems Integrations

**User Interfaces / Workflows:**

**SITES USE SLOPE TO MANAGE PATIENT INVENTORY**
(Screenshot shows a web interface titled "Register Archival Tissue Sample" with fields for barcode, subject, timepoint, collection date/time. The interface also has sections for "Clinical Supply Groups" and "Storage").

**VENDORS USE SLOPE TO MANAGE SITE RESUPPLY**
(Screenshot shows a web interface titled "Warehouse 1" with a list of "8mL CPT Blood Draw Kit" items, their serial numbers, expiration dates, and creation dates, indicating inventory management for a warehouse).

**LABS USE SLOPE TO MANAGE INBOUND SPECIMENS**
(Screenshot shows a web interface titled "Saliva #1" detailing a sample shipment from Prelude Therapeutics, including protocol, site, barcode, type, timepoint, collected date, posted date, and FedEx tracking number).

**CLINOPS TEAMS GET FULL SUPPLY CHAIN VISIBILITY**
(Screenshot shows a web interface titled "Replenishment #2" with a map indicating locations and status details of a shipment, including "Delivered" status in Whittier, CA and Santa Fe Springs, CA).

## Slide 6: Target Market
### Market Sizes (Concentric Circles):
| Market Segment                  | Size        |
| :------------------------------ | :---------- |
| Total Addressable Market        | $19.1B      |
| Serviceable Addressable Market  | $5.5B       |
| Serviceable Obtainable Market   | $28M        |

**Total Addressable Market**
Global trial supplies and logistics market size from recent Visiongain report.

**Serviceable Addressable Market**
29% of active clinical trials are operationally intensive oncology studies (~25k trial count).

**Serviceable Obtainable Market**
Established competitors leave us with 5% of oncology trials. Good timing and early adopter focus nets us 10% of this segment in near term.

### IDEAL CUSTOMER PERSONAS:
**Oncology Therapeutics / Diagnostics Trial Sponsors**
We directly target small & medium sized, well-funded oncology therapeutics / diagnostics Sponsors who prefer minimal CRO involvement. Their studies will have heavy inventory and biosample management needs.

**Large CROs and BioPharma Trial Sponsors**
Slope’s Vendor channel partners leverage existing procurement contracts with larger organizations for portfolio-driven co-sale opportunities. Tremendous amount of deal flow and high win rates.
