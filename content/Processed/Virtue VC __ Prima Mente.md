### Prima Mente (Devin Gilliam) - Company Update

- Left Datavant in January after 5 years, previously managing acquisitions and international business (London office)
- Neuroscientist by education, previously at SIOPs building clinical genomics datasets
- Founded Prima Mente with focus on biological language models for clinical applications
	- Everything trained on human data vs. AlphaGenome (too far removed from clinical research and impact)
	- Full stack AI company pushing new discoveries to patients
	- Published preprint on epigenomics model “Pleiades” last week
- $10M seed round closed couple months ago
	- Planning to raise again in next 6-12 months
	- Company previously went by “Cfdx” (may have spoken with Ravi Solanki ~1 year ago)

### Data Challenges and Market Insights

- Datavant should figure out how to capitalize on companies scraping biological data to fine-tune or build biological language models
	- Tons of interest in combining biological data with clinical data
	- Travis (from Datavant) founded two companies doing exactly this
- Current data access problems:
	- So much interesting biological data exists but doesn’t exist in format for training at scale
	- Tapping into UK Biobank for genomics/epigenomics, moving into proteomics
	- Beyond HIPAA/GDPR concerns - trusted research environments lack GPUs at scale for multi-billion parameter models
	- Protege doesn’t have tools to work past these barriers
- Solution: Fund wet lab and generate data in-house on smaller patient samples vs. accessing research consortium data
- Two expensive components:
	- Computation costs
	- Instruments and sample acquisition
	- Success in neurodegenerative diseases due to longitudinal biobanks willing to share plasma and brain tissue

### Clinical Applications and Business Strategy

- Preprint demonstrates 50x whole genome sequencing approach
	- Pair down assay in lab, dramatically decrease costs
	- Find right DMR regions where methylation signatures happen
	- Immediately beats P-tau 217 (definitive biomarker for early-onset dementia)
- Strategic focus areas:
	- Diagnostics: Biomarker discovery 20 years behind oncology in neurosciences
	- Drug development: Adding proteomics and other modalities for pharma interest (NVIDIA, Eli Lilly)
	- Clinical partnerships: Setting up partners to take diagnostics to market
- Biological validation challenges:
	- No good animal models in neurosciences
	- Starting cool target discovery work
	- Looking for partners in stem cells, iPSCs for in vitro validation at model speed
