Transcript

Devendra Deshmukh
No, no worries. So how can I help? I think Kunal, you said you wanted to kind of run some thoughts. Thoughts by.

Kunaal Patel
Right, yeah, a hundred percent, I think. Happy to give a little bit of context and then Emery, feel free to jump in if we want to have some pointed questions on this. But basically high level. We've been spending some time in the pharma logistics space, particularly thinking about supply chain logistics. And we just wanted to understand given Thermos. Thermos pretty big presence in both the CRO and CDMO businesses, you know, what the typical process was for supply chain logistics, what the workflow looked like and kind of where the gaps are, particularly like what are some pain points that could potentially be addressed.

Emre Karatas
Yeah, and.

Devendra Deshmukh
Go ahead.

Emre Karatas
No, I was just gonna say I think Kunal phrased it well. Maybe for our sake we're great to understand a little bit more where you play within the thermo organization because to Kunal's point, a lot of things within the organization that could be relevant for us here. But at the end of the day where we just spend a lot of time thinking about the entire pharmaceutical supply chain, specifically how you can for temperature controlled drugs bring technology to bring more visibility to that supply chain and efficiency to that supply chain. So as a part of that work, we've been talking to everyone across that value chain, from the biopharma manufacturers to people like yourself, to CDMOs like WuXi wholesalers and distributors like McKesson. The actual logistics service providers on the ground like UPS and some of the smaller players.

Emre Karatas
And so as we kind of look at all the different points along that value chain, along that supply chain, I should say we're thinking about novel technology solutions, whether that's piecing together a better data layer or AI that we can use to again bring more visibility and efficiency to that supply chain. So we do have specific questions within that. But like I said, it'd be great to just understand kind of your purview where you stand and so we can tailor some of our specific questions based on that background.

Devendra Deshmukh
Yeah, no, I think that's helpful. And I was going to ask about kind of when you think about supply chain, where and what type of supply chains you're talking about because you know there's a few different places that they come into picture, right. One is of course drug distribution, but you know, you're, there's the supply chains even just within, kind of getting a drug to market can be quite complicated. Right. When you're thinking about whether that's an immuno oncology franchise, like a keytruda or whatever, and you know, where things originate and what happens actually along that way can be quite complicated. So, so briefly back to your original question. Where do I play? So Thermo Fisher is big.

Devendra Deshmukh
We're about 120,000 people and probably 80 odd businesses in the company spread across six or seven large groups, some of it now more recently organized into sectors. So all of our kind of two big services businesses, whether that's the CDMO or the CRO side, has been kind of put together into a services sector as an example. So I sit within the life sciences sector, within the Analytical Instruments group, which is about a $7 billion group growing very well and within, more specifically within that, in a business called Digital Science. And while a lot of what we do is pure play software and software for life science, informatics, quality control, etc. The aspirations are much broader.

Devendra Deshmukh
And since we started some of this work over the last two plus years, but this year in particular it's gotten a significant more traction at the group level, the life sciences kind of solutions group level, where we've kind of put together a what I would call a framework for what does the digital laboratory of the future look like. And there are lots of different pieces to that. We don't want to own all of the pieces, we don't want to build all of those pieces. There are specific areas where we want to be very good at and particularly what we want to be good at.

Devendra Deshmukh
Is the connective tissue, the backbone that actually brings things all the way from hypothesis to being able to look at data sets and analyze them and drive decision making and inform your hypothesis to run at a macro level, the lab hyperloop. And within that there'll be smaller loops that you're going to run. But that's really where we want to kind of focus. And there are some pieces along that we are good at but we've not done a good job of connecting the dots along the value chain. Example being we've got the industry's largest and the most scaled E commerce business. So you know, through fisherside.com and thermo fisher.com between the two together probably have 4 million SKUs. Right.

Devendra Deshmukh
And so you're talking about some real scale in terms of E commerce, small dollar transactions, many of them adding up to a very scaled business, sophisticated backend built largely internally, etc. So that's kind of my playing ground. Right. So my day job is I have a functional role supporting kind of product strategy, product management and global marketing for the digital science business. But a lot of that is with a view to how does that actually connect in that broader ecosystem. And the Connect enterprise platform is a platform that we're driving from the digital science business. So it's a little bit of the tail wagging the dog. But how does that actually get to a scaled play for Thermo Fisher? Does that help? So in that sense, while we sit in the analytical instruments group, we're both a supplier vendor of software to our CDMO.

Devendra Deshmukh
All of the CDMO labs globally, all the sites, 30 plus of those sites, use our quality control lib software within the process of deploying that across our CRO network in its central labs, analytical labs. So we are, you know, in some way supplying software but also in working very closely with them to kind of, you know, look at where does the one plus one start to become a multiplier for the broader company?

Emre Karatas
Makes a ton of sense. Makes a ton of sense. And maybe then because I mentioned at the beginning there are many constituents across the supply chain and we're speaking with a ton of them, including yourself. So maybe for your world, for the analytical instruments for the E commerce platform, how do you think about supply chain today? What kind of vendors and partners are you working with? Really? Anything high level that comes to mind for you and then we can probe with some specific questions there. But as you think about the entire process, what bubbles up to the top for you?

Devendra Deshmukh
Yeah, I mean for us within the analytical instrument space. Perhaps the supply chain is more about, you know, both the hardware and software tech players and the components, if you will. Right. So one hand it could be for some of our instruments it's GPUs from Nvidia, and other hand it could be parts that are going to be needed to actually end up with a cryo electron microscope that's going to go into a research facility. So I think it's all of those pieces. But you know, I am interested in some of what you're doing in the sense that it was involved a little bit. This is many years ago now with a company that. I forgot what it's called now, but it suppliescape was its original name. I think it's called Tracelink now.

Devendra Deshmukh
And Tracelink does a lot of work in the kind of drug delivery side of it. You know, that originally they started to pulled together a platform that was primarily all about, you know, trying to prevent counterfeit drugs from getting to market. And you know, but if you think about that, we just had a discussion on this actually earlier in the week around. So relevant to what you're looking at, what is the supply chain for a cell or gene therapy look like? Right. It's super complicated because, you know, in some ways it's very simple in the sense that you've got to obviously have patient sample brought back in, blood brought back in, get it to the facility that is now going to be your integrated both research, development and manufacturing facility. That's how cell and gene therapy works.

Devendra Deshmukh
And then you're going to have to get that back to the patient and do it in record time because most, if not all of the patients that qualify for CGT are practically, you know, looking at sort of measured number of days. And it's absolutely critical that you know, you've got to be able to turn that around. Right. But if you look at that, BMS was giving this example at Brismi just on Tuesday, which is therefore it's sort of fresh in my mind, right. When you look at what BMS has done in that space, they've kind of gone in and actually built an entire platform on Salesforce. Right. So they built everything on SFDC. And it's quite interesting in that there's 9,500, if I remember right, patients around the world that have been benefited from bms, cgt, cell therapy, gene therapy.

Devendra Deshmukh
But when you look at the number of users of this capability for that entire supply chain on the platform, there's over 6,000 plus users. So when you think about it, for one patient, there are almost like hundreds of touch points in terms of what that supply chain actually looks like. Because all the way from who's collecting or doing the blood draw or forget the technical term for it.

Emre Karatas
Yeah, yeah.

Devendra Deshmukh
To how you are actually going to end up, you know, with getting that over who is transporting it, when, how does it get carried, what happens if there is transportation disruption? All of those pieces. Right. So what was intriguing to me in all of that is the fact that they chose to actually do it on a scale cloud platform like SFDC and not actually worry about building something from scratch, because you've got now access to SFDC essentially everywhere. It's got obviously all of the capabilities to be available in a mobile phone or a tablet or what have you. Contrast that with my experience at Merck a few years ago, where memory serves me right. We probably spent north of 20, $25 million building out a clinical supply chain software, logistics piece of software for the. On the clinical side.

Emre Karatas
But on SAP, was that for Keytruda or other.

Devendra Deshmukh
It was for everything. It was not drug program specific. It was for all kind of in support of all clinical trials. It was a clinical supply chain basically. So it didn't matter whether that's Keytruda or Gardasil or what have you, but it was all but the star difference kind of in terms of approaches. You know, five, six years ago, you invested 20, 30 million dollars in two plus years building something out on a very resource intensive platform like SAP. And in Merck's case, it made sense because when you think about the clinical supply chain and connecting pilot plants and Connecting CDMOs and everybody that's playing a role in it. All of Merck's 95% of Merck's business was being run on SAP globally. So in their minds it kind of made sense. But it just feels like a very heavyweight solution, if you will.

Emre Karatas
Right, yeah. And I realized some of these questions will be specific to that time at Merck. But if you think back, what was missing in SAP, right. We've heard from others that also use SAP and what they would be able to see through that platform in terms of visibility throughout the supply chain. But if you think back, did it, I mean, essentially did it go beyond inventory? Because that's what we've heard. It's like SAP is great for the enterprise to get a sense of inventory, but it might not have provided that end to end visibility that people are really looking for to get deeper and connect all these constituents.

Devendra Deshmukh
I think that is very true, I think. SAP. So for a long time, right. I think what the pharma industry struggled with, which the discrete manufacturing industry has gotten, right, is the whole product lifecycle management. Right. Like how do you actually break down a small molecule, large molecule into its constituents to actually end up with all of the pieces needed for product lifecycle management? And, you know, does a plm, traditional PLM system kind of help or not? Right. And I think SAP directionally has been trying to make its way towards being able to have a lot of those PLM capabilities. You know, in the last year and a half, you've heard partners of SAP like Accenture talk a little bit about kind of the use of SAP even in things like digital process representation for areas like tech transfer.

Devendra Deshmukh
You know, where when you're thinking about part of the supply chain problem is you want to take something from, say, a pilot plant into a commercial facility. You're talking about, you know, 15, 16 months and $20 million worth of work and time. Right. And so how do you actually digitalize a lot of that? And I don't know that I'm not that close to SAP, but, you know, I don't know that they've gotten it right from the little that I've seen from some webinars and all that. I think it's too expensive, too cumbersome a solution to kind of put into place for something like that. And it's. And if you go back in time, emre, I think it's like the whole thing with like Documentum. Yeah, sure. Document management, it exists, it's there and then it's quickly gone.

Devendra Deshmukh
And VIVA has taken its place and replaced everything in terms of what happens around all types of different document management and life sciences. So it's a little bit of that, I think, not being able to keep up with the needed simplicity and ease of use, ease of deployment, ease of configuration reconfiguration in that space.

Emre Karatas
Well said. Well said, Khan. Any other questions there before I keep rolling?

Kunaal Patel
No, I think that was a great overview. I think. Let's keep it rolling.

Emre Karatas
Yeah, yeah. And so as you. I mean, you're touching on, I don't know if choke points is the right word, but a little. A lot of different points in this process. Like, we have the entire life cycle of cell and gene therapy. We're ultimately there. The manufacturing is the product. And so I think we see a lot of the value there. You touch on moving from a plant facility to commercial manufacturing. We can also think about just for A CDMO in general, like a thermo, just they're even within their own organization, the value chain from the actual APIs to the formulation to the packaging. And so we could walk through I guess a couple of these processes and steps. But of the ones that we've discussed today, is there anyone that you think has the most friction or.

Emre Karatas
And then therefore maybe the most value if you can unlock that friction? Again, I know purposely kind of a high level question to summarize some of the concepts we've been discussing, but I really appreciate you walking through all this. And is there, of the ones that you've mentioned, are there any that really stick out to you as the biggest pain points?

Devendra Deshmukh
I think, I think there are two areas. Right. And I don't know whether I would put these in supply chain, but maybe if you kind of broaden the definition of supply chain, maybe they fit in there. Right. Which is one is, and we've invested in building some capabilities in this space ourselves, might have been with someone like Accenture, I don't know, or Bain, or partnering with one of these firms. But we as a CDMO are one of the largest recipients of inbound tech transfers from pharma sponsors. And so, you know, we obviously these sponsors, they want to also know exactly what's happening where on the manufacturing shop floor.

Devendra Deshmukh
And this is one of those areas which gets into sort of a little bit of, you know, territorial kind of views where the sponsor says, well, you know, let's take it Biontech or Pfizer or Moderna and we're manufacturing the vaccine for them, for Covid, awesome. Like they know that it's in trusted hands with a good company, but they also want to know exactly what's going on and where in that quote unquote supply chain so that they can have near real time visibility into that. And if that can eliminate the need for sort of inspections later and sending people and you know, looking at all of that, the body of kind of data reports more, less data that came out of the manufacturing world, then maybe it helps them get product to market faster because it allows them to release those batches faster.

Devendra Deshmukh
So there's that sort of supply chain right from the outside looking in. As a sponsor, you want visibility into what it is that we're doing now. You may be. Well, you pay me for the outcome. You don't pay me to know exact. Every single step that I'm taking. That's sort of my ip. In some ways it helps Thermo Fisher if we are able to get you product faster, you should be happy about it and you should want to pay for it versus wanting to know exactly what's going on where. Right. So there's that aspect, but there is an element of kind of transparency. And what we've done is we've built. We built a tool called, I think we call it my supply, which is available to a lot of our sponsors to look at some of that information, not necessarily all of it.

Devendra Deshmukh
Flip to sort of the other piece, which is to go faster, going back to that whole tech transfer and that value chain, less the supply chain. Anything that can be done to accelerate time to value, that is reduce the amount of time that it goes from, you know. Yes. I want you to manufacture this for me to now you have it ready for scale manufacture to, you know, being able to cut cost off of that process are actually quite important problems to solve and not ones that I don't think the industry has fully figured that out. You know, sort of done that a little bit with the cgt. Space just forces things to be different. But how do you do that in traditional kind of manufacturer where, you know, CGT at the end of the day is not manufactured at scale. Right.

Devendra Deshmukh
So you want to do something where you. You did it at, you know, whatever, 200 liters and now you want to do it at 20,000 liters scale. Well, how does that work? Right. There's still a very much an engineering element of going through that. And that's another challenge that, you know, we want to tackle from our lens. It's sort of on our top five areas from a digital science perspective to go after, but I don't know that it's an easy one to tackle.

Emre Karatas
Yeah, yeah, Extremely helpful. Maybe last question. This can be a little more broad because I'm curious to get your read from within thermo here. How are you thinking about or how is the organization thinking about any changes that might come with the biosecure act or frankly, any other geopolitical risks as we do think about this global supply chain that we're discussing here.

Devendra Deshmukh
I think we believe we're well prepared for it. I don't know that I can give you a very broad perspective. I'm probably not in a lot of those conversations. I think that's maybe more of a conversation directly at the company leadership level. But having gone through some of our internal programs, this was actually a case study that was presented to us as part of our internal general management program. And, you know, what we've done is if you think about thermo Fisher just in our pharma business, in the CDMO business, as I said, we've got multiple manufacturing facilities around the globe. Right. If you think about viral vectors, we're doing that in Massachusetts, in Plainfield, if you look at some other aspects of the pharma business, we've got a couple sites in. In Italy, you couple in the uk, Germany, Switzerland, all over. Right.

Devendra Deshmukh
And then you look at the macro Thermo Fisher. And I believe, if I'm not mistaken, that we have well north of 150 manufacturing facilities. So we do run into these challenges. And I'll give you an example from that case study. We take certain reagents and certain things into China and we don't necessarily manufacture all of that in China. It didn't make sense. It kind of goes out to other parts of the world and it was being manufactured in a certain country. China put an embargo on the country and everything got stuck in customs in China. And Thermo Fisher was told, yeah, well, sorry, this is made in X country. And we're currently not allowing anything made in that country to come in. Okay.

Devendra Deshmukh
So were able to within weeks actually look at the supply chain and say, yeah, we can move X, Y and Z here, there and quickly retool the supply chain and then be able to say, okay, this is no longer manufactured in that country. Based on, of course, and it's all about percentages and what's the composition and be able to do that. So in our DNA, I think in what Thermo Fisher calls, It's kind of PPI, practical process improvement, sort of like what Danaher calls DBS, the DANAHub business system. We have PPI and that is sort of in our DNA as a company. And it allows us to kind of be very effective with some of these process changes and some retooling. So I think, you know, in. And we do manufacturing even in China. Right.

Devendra Deshmukh
So it's not like we don't do manufacturing in China. So I think from that sense, we feel. I think the company feels like it's in a reasonable spot. You know, could we get caught off guard? Sure. But I think we have enough checks and balances in the system.

Emre Karatas
I would tend to agree. There might be some other. CDMO is not to names that probably are more concerned than thermo at this point, but that. I love that case study. That's such a great example because I don't think any of us can exact to predict the future. But no matter what that future looks like you need to be nimble, you need to have more visibility and you'd be able to actually react to some of those changes coming down the pipe. And so this has been incredibly helpful. I want to be sensitive of your time on a Friday afternoon. I really appreciate it.

Emre Karatas
Again, we're getting close to the top of the hour here, but just want to say as well, I know you can all spoke before, but whether it's this particular journey we're on learning about the pharma supply chain, I'm sure there'll be a great company or companies to come out of that we can introduce to you to hopefully help you and Thermo and many others across the pharma value chain. That's clinical research. Whether that's on the commercial side of the house with any rural evidence or ho r we have a lot of solutions and startups across the entire pharma value chain. So I really enjoyed this discussion and just wanted to end it with hopefully of many others, whether that's on supply chain or any other companies that we may come across or work with.

Devendra Deshmukh
Sounds good. Happy to help. Excellent. Have a wonderful weekend and happy Thanksgiving.

Emre Karatas
Yeah, you too. Thanks a ton.

Devendra Deshmukh
Take care guys. Bye now.
