## Slide 4: Specialty Pharmacy Market Growth

# Specialty Pharmacy Market Growth

*   Specialty drug spend of ~$150B in 2018; expected to grow at a 9% CAGR from ‘18-’24

**US Specialty Drug Sales from 2013-2024 ($B)1**

| Segment                | 2013 ($B) | 2018 ($B) | 2024 ($B) | Segment CAGR 2018-24 |

| Autoimmune             | -         | 45        | -         | 3%                   |

| (Remaining components) | 63        | 9         | -         |                      |

*   Overall specialty pharmacy drug spend growth is expected to slow down, driven by plateaus / shrinkage in Autoimmune (Enbrel, Humira) HIV (Genvoya, Truvada), Multiple Sclerosis (Copaxone, Tecfideira), and Hepatitis (Harvoni)
*   Pharmacy benefit represented 70% of total spend in 2018; growing at 5% CAGR to 74% by 2024. Growth exceeds that of medical benefit (2% CAGR)

**Pharmacy benefit as % of total spend**

| Year | % of Total Spend |
| :--- | :--------------- |
| 2013 | 63%              |
| 2018 | 70%              |
| 2024 | 74%3             |

1 For 2013 and 2018, based on top 200 sales drugs in 2018; for 2024, top 200 drugs in 2024 including pipeline drugs
2 Estimated specialty drug sales for 2024 also includes in-pipeline drugs that could potentially be specialty drugs (based on whether the same ATC code indications are primarily treated by specialists)
3 When calculating pharmacy benefit, did not include in-pipeline drugs with no TA classification

## Slide 5: Hospital Specialty Pharmacy Market Opportunity

# Hospital Specialty Pharmacy Market Opportunity

*   McKinsey estimates that 70% of specialty drug prescriptions originate within a health system. Of this $105 billion in annual spend, hospital pharmacies today capture only about 20%
*   60% of the $105 billion could be captured by 340B hospital programs, implying an addressable SPx market of $63 billion today, growing to more than $100 billion by 2024

**Hospital Specialty Pharmacy Market Opportunity ($ in billions)**

## Slide 7: Historical Fulfillment Capture Ramps by Driver

# Historical Fulfillment Capture Ramps by Driver

*   Historically, Shields’ health system customers reached capture rates of ~40% in ~5-6 years on average, driven by expanding payor access and getting patients on therapy

**System-Level Capture Ramps [1]**

| % of Full Potential | Yr 1 | Yr 2 | Yr 3 | Yr 4 | Yr 5 | Yr 6 |
| :------------------ | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Payor Access**    | 90%  | 91%  | 91%  | 93%  | 94%  | 95%  |
| **LDD Access**      | 38%  | 49%  | 64%  | 79%  | 85%  | 85%  |
| **Clinic Penetration** | 4%   | 10%  | 16%  | 32%  | 39%  | 43%  |
| **New Patient / Physician Capture** | 2%   | 27%  | 35%  | 53%  | 56%  | 59%  |
| **Overall Fulfillment Capture** | 50%  | 62%  | 69%  | 76%  | 84%  | 90%  |

**Annotations:**
*   Rapidly reach 90% based on 340B "must sell" regulations
*   Based on roll-out strategy with system, as well as 340B eligibility
*   Add specialty pharmacy Rx coverage to commercial payor agreements upon renewal (3+ year cycle)
*   Gap reflects fact that PBM specialty pharmacies will continue to capture patients through their marketing / steerage efforts

# 340B Discounts Increase Over Time

*   340B margins tend to be higher for older drugs with a history of price increases, and some of these drugs have a large concentration in Shields’ current drug portfolio (Humira is ~10% of total fulfillment)

**340B Discount Calculation**

| CPI-U penalty (AMP – CPI-U adjusted launch price) |              |
| **340B discount**                |              |
| Price to 340B entity             |              |

*   There is little differential in commercial reimbursement for 340B vs. non-340B drugs
*   Margins are ~60% for 340B drugs vs. ~5% for non-340B drugs

**Commercial Reimbursement: 340B vs. Non-340B [1]**

**CAGR '16-'18:**
*   340B: 10%
*   Non-340B: 13%

**Shields Health System Pharmacy Gross Margin: 340B vs. Non-340B**

**$ Revenue to Shields**

*   MSA structure is more stable and provides downside protection due to billable expense reimbursement
*   At-Risk agreements and JV allow for the Company to participate in gross profit generated by the Specialty Pharmacy, providing upside potential if the Specialty Pharmacy program at the health system generates significant profitability
*   UMass is defined as a JV (they own 40% of HoldCo) but contract technically is an MSA with favorable revenue-share dynamics

## Slide 35: Fulfillment Capture Ramp Assumptions

# Fulfillment Capture Ramp Assumptions

*   The mature customer ramp based on historical data (excl. Hep C) was used in conjunction with the model developed with McKinsey to project capture ramp for all of the systems within the Ramping, Newly Signed and New Customer cohorts[1]

**Specialty Fulfillment Capture Ramp – WCAS Base Case**

| Specialty Fulfillment Capture | 2019E | 2020E | 2021E | 2022E | 2023E | 2024E |
| :---------------------------- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |

| Ramping                       | 5%    | 12%   | 18%   | 24%   | 30%   | 37%   |
| Newly Signed                  | 2%    | 6%    | 11%   | 16%   | 22%   | 29%   |
| New Customer Adds             | 1%    | 3%    | 7%    | 13%   | 20%   | 27%   |
| Mature Customers Historical Avg. | 38%   | 39%   | 40%   | 41%   | 42%   | 43%   |

*   **Mature:** UMass, Baystate, Berkshire, Hartford (4)
*   **Ramping:** NYU, Rush, Bronson, Lifespan, Dignity, NYP (6)
*   **New:** Houston Methodist, Tampa General, Albany, Southcoast, Inova, Connecticut Children’s, Spartanburg, Binghamton, Riverside, New Hanover (10)
*   **New Customer Adds:** Assume 4 additional customers annually

Note: Fulfillment capture rates by cohort are weighted average by $ specialty opportunity

## Slide 36: Earnings Growth by Cohort

# Earnings Growth by Cohort

*   From 2018A to 2024E, ~18% of contribution profit growth is driven by the Mature cohort, ~51% by the Ramping cohort, ~16% by the Newly Signed cohort and ~15% by the New Customer Adds

## Slide 43: Returns Distribution Assumptions

# Returns Distribution Assumptions

1.  **340B Margin Deterioration for Top 10 Drugs**
    *   Compress 340B margins of top 10 drugs (~40% of total fulfillment) to average non-340B margin of ~5% in 2021E (held flat thereafter)
    *   Assumes MSAs are renegotiated to reflect reduced program economics
    *   Reduced OpEx by 20% to reflect corporate cost cuts
2.  **Customer Losses for Upcoming Renewals in 2022E and 2023E**
    *   Substantive customers with contract expirations in 2022E and 2023E do not renew
    *   Includes Rush (Dec. 2022), Lifespan (Dec. 2022), NYP (June 2023) and Dignity (Dec. 2023)
3.  **Exit Multiple Overhang**
    *   Exit business at ~9.5x (similar to Diplomat) due to 340B overhang and lack of whitespace (assumes Base Case projections)
4.  **Addition of More JV’s that Resemble UMass**
    *   Add one JV in both 2020E and 2021E (contributing $36M of EBITDA in 2024E) that have similar economics to UMass in exchange for 5% equity each in HoldCo
5.  **Steeper Ramp Curves for Ramping & Newly Signed Cohorts and New Customer Adds**
    *   Ramping and Newly Signed cohorts (15 customers[1]) and new customer adds (4/year) reach 40% capture rate in ~3 years (vs. 6 years), like the 2015 cohort
6.  **WBA Payor / LDD Access Upside**
    *   $30M of incremental earnings from expanded payor / LDD access from WBA, phased in at $10M in 2020E, $20M in 2021E and $30M thereafter

[1] NYU ramp is not adjusted.
