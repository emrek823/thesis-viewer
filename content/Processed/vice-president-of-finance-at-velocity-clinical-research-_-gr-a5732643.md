# Document Content

## Q&#x26;A Section

### Q: Please explain any past, current, or future financial planning or accounting challenges that have become more urgent and have increased the need for software like Auxilius, Condor, etc (e.g., accrual accuracy, rising clinical trial costs, or name others)?
**A:** This is an age-old debate. Knowing and having access to the latest and greatest financial information at any point in time, accrual cash flow planning, and audits. As complexity increases, there is a correlation with a rise in the need for these.

### Q: How are changing compliance and audit expectations (e.g., PCAOB, SOX, FASB, audit risks and fines, or name others) shaping the way your finance team operates and increasing or decreasing the need your team has for software like Auxilius or Condor?
**A:** It depends on the scale. If it is a smaller biotech company, it is easy to manage without. If the company is bigger with multiple running trials, having one of these assets is a differentiator and cuts down costs from a compliance standpoint. I still don't think they're must-haves now, but having an understanding of what these platforms do helps;

----

## Client Interaction

**Client:** Thanks so much for taking time for us today. We are looking to learn more about clinical accrual software in the biopharma industry, specifically companies like Auxilius and Condor. However, we are also interested in the broader software landscape and understanding the regulatory environment, the market climate, and ultimately the need for solutions like this. Before we jump in, we'd love to learn a little more about your background and your current place of work at Velocity.

**Expert:** Yeah. VP Finance at Velocity Clinical. I head up the revenue, accounts receivable, and cash management functions globally for the company. We don't work with Auxilius, but I've been involved with Auxilius. We work with almost every payer out there in the market, ranging from Greenphire, ClinCard, Signant, Pharma Clinical. As it comes to the products you mentioned, Auxilius, Condor, I've been hearing a lot about these from our biotech customers, in particular.

Have been associated with Auxilius for a while with Adam Weisman, who's been the co-founder and CEO. Prior to Velocity, Parexel decade plus ran everything there except for tax and treasury. That's where I had my first experience going with the Greenphire payment portal or the Greenphire payment processing. Have worked with almost every other vendor, be it Coupa.

----

**Client:** Could you tell me a little bit about when you first were introduced to Auxilius and Condor?

**Expert:** Auxilius, I think I was introduced way back in maybe 2018, 2019, even before Adam was certain of what he wanted to do with the company. Condor was a few years ago, I think it was either at Velocity or right at the end of my life at Parexel, we were just talking to some of our biotech clients having difficulties in terms of us as a CRO providing information to them. I think Condor brought in to basically say, "Is this something that we can use?"

----

**Client:** Got it. Could you describe to me for Parexel and Velocity, the number of clinical trials that each organization supported, maybe just consecutively at one time? Also, the organizational charts for the finance departments. How many people were in the finance departments, and what were their roles?

**Expert:** Some of these things are not publicly available information. I'm going to give you some broad crossroad.

# Document Content

## Client
What I'm looking to understand is the size of each organization in terms of clinical trial complexity. Our understanding is for Auxilius and Condor. The need increases as complexity increases in terms of managing multiple simultaneous trials, particularly in phases II and phase III. I'm just trying to get a sense for where Parexel and Velocity would fall in terms of SMB, mid-market, and then complexity, so I can better contextualize that thesis of need for this particular product.

## Expert
The USP that you've been told is correct in terms of concurrent trials, phase II, phase III. First, let's start with Parexel. At any given point in time, the company would be running anywhere between 500, 600 to 1,000+ trials concurrently. When it comes to Velocity, Velocity is a site network, and it's a much smaller company as compared to Parexel. From a concurrent trial phase II, phase III, anywhere between 250-500 at any given point in time.

## Client
Got it. How would you classify both those companies? I would assume they would not be SMBs, maybe mid-market or enterprise. I'd be curious to how you would classify it. Also, your definition for how you define an SMB biopharma versus a mid-market. Enterprise, we generally understand that's more of the AstraZenecas of the world, but would love to hear your thoughts on where you would put those two companies and then broadly how you would define those definitions.

## Expert
I think my way of looking at that is a little bit different. Instead of looking at number of trials, I'm a finance guy, I look at dollar value of yearly revenue. Anything doing less than $1 billion year of revenue I put them as middle market. That range for me would be $500 million-$1 billion, would be the mid-sized middle market companies. Anything less than $500 million yearly, still substantial number, but that for me would be the early markets.

Sean Doolan

As it relates to either sites, CROs or biotech. I think your definition of biopharma is what I'm calling biotech. You will find a lot of these companies all the way from pre-clinical, meaning zero revenue, to $500 million in revenue. From what I understand of these products that you're trying to research, this is the key market for those products.

Not to say that these cannot be used or are not being used at $1+ billion companies, but somebody like a Parexel, somebody like a Pfizer, they already have the muscle power. Again, innovation and disruption is part of the game. Greenphire did it seven, eight, 10 years ago when everybody thought they had it under control and nobody did. There's no reason for me to believe that these products cannot penetrate those markets. The proof of concept lies in, my opinion, sub-$500 million companies.

## Client
Between $500 million-$1 billion you would view as the sweet spot, is that right?

## Expert
I would actually view the sweet spot as in the pre-clinical to the $500 million. If you are a biotech and you are trying to clench every cent with your teeth, I would want you to use Auxilius, because the way I see the product, it is definitely better than human beings trying to do all of that on Excel.

## Client
What percent of the market do you believe exists in that sweet spot? Anecdotally, as a percentage, our research shows there are about 4,000 U.S.-based biopharma firms. Anecdotally, maybe 2/3 of those are smaller SMBs. I don't know if we're defined in the same way as you are. Would be curious from a revenue perspective, what percent you think is in that sweet spot?

# Expert Discussion on Clinical Trial Financial Management

## Expert Insights

**Expert:**
I think from account perspective, you will find a lot more, but from a revenue perspective you will find less. From a revenue standpoint, the percentages are then going to be fewer towards the bigger players. Somebody like the Moderna is going to have a much bigger part of the pie when I do the calculation on revenue dollars. In the 4,000-ish count of companies, I think about probably 2/3 count-wise should land up in the zero to the $500-million revenue range.

**Client:**
Maybe just to hear a little more about your knowledge of Auxilius and Condor, and how would you describe the value of those products?

**Expert:**
In a nutshell, we're trying to add a lot more to it, but I think at the core of it, what these products are trying to do is eliminate the data lag, the disjointed systems and the manual human efforts needed. To piece together at any given point in time how much cash have I burnt on my clinical trial? From now until the known end of the clinical trial, what is my need and demand for remaining cash burned? Basically, that's the crux of how I understand these products.

**Client:**
How would you quantify the ROI of a solution like Auxilius or Condor? Do you look at it as time savings for your team that may replace the need for an additional FTE? Is it reduced cost through better accounting and auditing or neither or both or something else?

**Expert:**
It's both of those. Plus, anytime a product like this tells me as a finance leader or tells my counterpart in operations as the chief operating officer or whoever, that I have got a problem or I potentially might have a problem coming up in six, nine months down the line, anytime a product like this helps preempt a situation like that, I would count that as part of the ROI. The key is, how do you define that? How do you measure it, how do you track it, how do you put a number on it?

If you were to go back and simply read public information on how many trials get shut down because the biotech ran out of money, way too many. I'm sure those people were all doing the best they could to save the trial. If the science is not there, forget about Auxilius, Condor, Parexel, nothing's going to work. If the science is there, then it becomes all the more important to make sure that you are financially more proven. These are the products that are helping keep the financial viability in the design.

**Client:**
Thank you. Maybe a little bit on how you would describe the differences between Greenphire, Auxilius, and Condor, to your knowledge?

**Expert:**
Greenphire, in my opinion, continues to be living the payment processor space. They've done a lot, they've added a lot more bolt-on stuff. If you were to talk to their executive, you're going to get a very different feel. To me, Greenphire is still the middleman who makes their money with helping move funds from a sponsor to a CRO to a site, and any combination thereof. The Condors and the Auxiliuses of the world, they're not necessarily so much in the payment processing, even though they aspire to be.

These guys are more in the business partnering, business planning side where, "Hey, we're going to help you set up, run, manage, and report on your trial and do it better, faster, more efficient." Those are Condor and Auxilius. Between Condor and Auxilius, I think there's a lot of nuanced differences and it's been a while since I saw Condor, but Auxilius, very recently. It's more about the usability, the scalability.

Some of the bells and whistles around, I know Auxilius recently added the predictive analytics for investigative forecasting, which basically takes all your historical data and it also can read through your contract and basically say, "Okay, here's what the contract says, here's where you are at based on historical data."

data. Here's where I think you are going to be in three, six next months or until the end of the trial." I think they got a little bit more finesse that model, as opposed to somebody like Condor at this point.

**Client**
It sounded like you all had selected Auxilius. I'm curious if you evaluated Condor at that time.

**Expert**
Condor was, like I said, during my product sale days, I keep hearing about them a lot with some of my other clients who use them. Condor was brought in by a biotech client because they were struggling to do all this. We were struggling to provide them all the data manually as a CRO. They were brought in, which quite frankly is a good thing. If you know you got a CRO has a client who's a prospective client for a Condor or Auxilius, and that client actually brings in one of these guys, that just shows confidence. They brought in Condor and that had some very extensive demos of the product to see what it was doing, how it was doing.

**Client**
Interesting. Who do you think is not a good fit for what Auxilius or Condor provides? Who would have less need?

**Expert**
That's an interesting question. Anybody who thinks we've got this under control, I'd say would have less meaning. The question then becomes, who thinks they have it under control? Many people. If you look at the clinical trial industry, still super fragmented. Money movement is still a pain in this industry. Payment reconciliation is still a pain. I'd say it would be naive of people to simply think I don't need it. If there is that company who already made tons of investments in people or in a certain product or in building in-house capabilities on top of an existing product, they might be less interested in going with somebody like an Auxilius or a Condor.

**Client**
Sean Doolan
It sounds like you believe most biotech firms should use something like Condor or Auxilius.
**DO NOT COPY**
sd@virtuevc.com

**Expert**
I believe every firm should be very prudent with their financial management. They do that by using Condor, Auxilius, or they do that by hiring a thousand people. That is their choice. The value prop which these guys are trying to solve is a value prop that every company inevitably has to solve for, should solve for. The ones who don't solve for, they end up filing Chapter 11.

The value prop is solid. It is indeed a big problem. This whole fragmentation, if you think about the three-legged stool in this industry, you've got a sponsor, you've got a CRO, you've got the site. Between these three people there's a triangle where money needs to keep moving. None of these people's systems talk to each other, none of these people's data talk to each other, even all of it should. That's basically the gap between Condor, Auxilius, and our services are trying to serve.

**Client**
To your knowledge, are most people using humans to solve this today versus some software automation like Auxilius?

**Expert**
For the most part, it is humans plus Microsoft Excel.

**Client**
Why is that? Is it knowledge, that they're not aware of a solution, or is it cultural perspective that this can be solved with humans and doesn't need to be solved with software?

# Expert Discussion on Clinical Trials

## Expert Insights

I think a lot of this has to do with the second point that you made. It's more about, this is how it has always been done. This has been a very highly regulated industry, as it should be. Therefore, historically, the resistance to change has been super high. Whenever you see change coming, you start to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and the patient impact of any of this. The good thing with these products is, you can actually tackle all of that pretty easily right on the outset. I think with some of these companies, the more mature they get, the more firepower they get from a selling perspective, the more sensible they get in how to engage with the biotech sponsors, how to engage with the CROs, or should I even be engaging with CROs? Should I go directly to a sponsor?

There's a lot of, in my opinion, things to be thought of, because in the three stakeholder pyramid that I told you, there's a sponsor, there's a CRO, there's a site. In my opinion, Auxilius, Condors and these guys are still not 100% figured out who is it that they want to please first. You would want to please the sponsor because basically they are the ones playing this, but given the size of CROs have already grown to, there might be times when they actually go. I don't know if that's happening, but this is a very close possible scenario.

They go and try and sell to a sponsor. Sponsor might be willing, but the next trial that the sponsor has, the sponsor already locked in a CRO and the CRO comes in and says, "By the way, what's this affiliate thing? I already have 50 people who want to do this. Don't worry about it, I got it under control." You got a good product, fine, but you got to figure out how to unlock value from that product, which I think is going to come with time and maturity in these companies.

## Client Inquiry

**Client:** Sorry, that last point, would you mind repeating where you think the solution is?

**Expert:** The solution, like I said, and this is something that I am as an outsider, just giving you my perspective, it's about thinking who your primary customer is. Is your primary customer the sponsor or is your primary customer the CRO? Is your primary customer the site or is it all of the above or a combination? Many times when you go and sell directly to a sponsor, a sponsor might be willing to onboard an Auxilius or what have you, but when they go, they, meaning the sponsor, goes and starts their next clinical trial, most likely it's going to end up being with a CRO.

The CRO at that point goes back to the sponsor and says, "By the way, what is this Auxilius thing that you want to do? I already have a team of 50 people who've been doing it. I know how to do it. You don't need to pay for this." Those are the discussions, those are the, let's say, value propositions that these companies like Condor and Auxilius need to figure out on how to position all that.

## Parties Involved in Clinical Trials

**Client:** Can you outline for me the parties involved? There's the sponsor, the CRO, who else is involved, typically in the management of a clinical trial?

**Expert:** From a financial management perspective, there's the sponsor, there's the CRO, and then there's the research site. The sponsor is the one who wants to conduct a trial. They're the ones who are paying all the bills. The CRO, those the Parexels, IQVIAs, PPDs of the world. Those are the ones who are managing, conducting the trial. Ultimately, it's the site, the clinical research sites, the SMOs, the Velocity of the world or what-have-you, who actually find, recruit and administer the drug on the patient. This whole concept of knowing how much have I done versus how much more do I have to do, this whole concept of investigator accruals, all of that comes from the sites, gathering the data, entering it into the EDC. Again, it's all a human being-led process, so take it for what you want.

That data then driving the actual expenses. If I already seen 10 patients then I have to as a CRO, account for 10 patients worth of expenses as part of my investigation, a fee on my P&#x26;L, then I have to provide it to the sponsor so that they will know that, I need to cut a check for these 10 patients, and then I need to know, for the next 10 months, what is my recruitment, what is my burn going to look like? Which is data again.

technically should come from the site. This three-legged stool is all broken, which is what these companies,
Condor and Auxilius, are trying to fix.

## Client
If Auxilius or Condor were selling to the site, how positive or negative would that be, considering the different
actors that you're discussing here, the CRO and the sponsor potentially having their own solutions? How
much political influence does the site have in this scenario if they want to ensure the usage of Auxilius or
Condor?

## Expert
I think that is something to be seen. With the advent of bigger site management organizations like Velocity,
Florence, Alcanza and these guys, they are starting to see somewhat of a seat at the table. They are being
brought in earlier in the sales process between the sponsor and the CRO, so their voices are heard. I don't
think they've got the numbers, from a revenue standpoint, or they've got the political clout to use your
terms yet to be able to say, "On the next trial we will use Auxilius for financial management." We're not
there yet.

Think about in the early 2000s, how did Greenphire make its way into the industry. It was not until
Greenphire got a partnership with Pfizer. It was not Greenphire who had any say. Everybody had discounted
that company. They couldn't even go to the CROs and say, "You're going to use it." They used Pfizer to then
help get Greenphire into the CROs. Meaning Pfizer was telling the CROs back in the day, "By the way, for
Excel, PPD, etc., if you want my business, my meaning Pfizer's business, I have decided to use Greenphire as
the payment processor.

Me as Pfizer, I am not going to cut checks to you anymore. You will need to upload all of your requests in
Greenphire. I will prepay Greenphire and Greenphire is going to handle all day-to-day with you." I think these
Auxilius and these guys, even though they have good products that are more site-facing or CRO-facing, until
and unless they get the sponsors to push top down, they will have an uphill battle.

## Client                                    Sean Doolan

Got it. How optimistic or pessimistic     sd@virtuevc.com
are you on the future growth of Auxilius or Condor in this space? Given
your knowledge of what they do and the market environment, do you think demand will increase, decrease
or roughly stay the same for these types of solutions?

## Expert
My view is that demand should increase. I'm also of the opinion that in times like today where liquidity is a
big concern, interest rates are high, managing on-time and on-budget has always been important. It's all the
more important now. As the market starts to open up, when people want to go after the liquidity that will
open up with the market opening up, people who have more conviction behind their numbers, people who
have proven result that I said I will deliver X in two quarters and I did X, or I said X, I did Y, but here's the
delta between my X and Y and here's what I'm doing to fix it.

Those people will have an edge over others who don't. In my opinion, there should be more demand because
that's the value prop of these tools. What I don't know is, what is the cost model that Auxilius and Condor,
these guys, are using today. I knew it from a while ago, but what are they using today? For an executive like
me to sit down and say, "If I hire a 20-people team in India, it's going to cost me $200,000 a year," for
example, versus "If I go with you, you're going to be $500,000 of software cost and maybe three months of
implementation," then I'm probably not going to do it. If it same then, "Okay, let's think about it," or "If you
are going to undercut it by 50% then absolutely, let's do it." That is an area where I think these guys, and I'm
sure they're doing it already, that they need to further outline very simply, succinctly. Their numbers match,
which is the ROI.

## Client
On that point, what price do you think makes sense to evaluate a software like this? You mentioned
$200,000 for an abroad team. Is that about the price that this gets more or less appetizing for you based

**Expert**
Let's say somebody like an Auxilius was to come in and say, "I am going to manage end-to-end financials for your top 200 trials that you are running and it's going to cost you, let's say, $100,000," and again "I'm making all of this up because it's not that simple. I got to have them go through my own procurement process, figure out all the soft compliance, which I think they are now soft compliant." That is something that I'd be willing to entertain. Take it back to a sponsor, a smaller biotech. It would really depend on what is the pipeline for their clinical candidate.

If they are running five trials and if that's basically everything that they got and if they're already scrapped for cash, they could potentially go with this, but they would need a much bigger ROI versus what I'm going to need, because I am not necessarily dependent on that one drug getting approval and then starting my revenue function, which is the point I was trying to make earlier.

One of the key things that these companies need to decide, which maybe they have, is who do they want to be in bed with. Is it sites, is it sponsors? Is it CROs? My recommendation? Sponsors. At the end of the day that's the company who's paying everyone's bills. If you want to be with the sponsors, then some of your unit economics have to look different because with sub-$500 million sponsors, the economy of scale is lower. They have only X number of candidates in the pipeline at any given point in time which need this type of service. If they already have some candidates who are generating revenue, those don't need an Auxilius.

----

**Client**
Maybe on that point. They're generally working with the sponsors themselves. How does that make you feel in terms of their go-to-market approach?

----

**Expert**
I think that's the right first step, until the first gateway into this whole pyramid is via the sponsor.

----

**Client**
For the technologies that you mentioned in your survey response, Ariba, Coupa, Summit, Greenphire, do you view Auxilius as its own platform, or do you view it as a potential extension of the ERP or maybe an EDC like Medidata where it's more of a feature of one of these larger products, or this is a whole platform offering on its own?

----

**Expert**
Interesting question. I think the way it's being positioned today, I would think of those as they are their own platform but they've got decent integration with ERP, EDCs, CTMSs of the world. If I was somebody like a Veeva or a Medidata, probably I'd keep an eye on them and maybe at one point just go and buy them.

To your knowledge, based on the complexity that exists in Auxilius, how difficult do you think it could be for Veeva or Medidata to break this on their own? I know you don't have the technical intimacy with the products to know for sure, but just based upon your knowledge of what they provide, Veeva and Medidata and what Auxilius provides, does it feel like it'd be difficult or does it feel like it would not be that difficult?

----

**Expert**
Yeah, I think it'd be doable.

----

**Client**
Be doable? What makes you say that? Is it the depth or lack of depth within the Auxilius product, or something else?

In my personal view, Medidata and Veeva or others have just never had any motivation to solve this problem. They have the data. The key element in solving this problem that Auxilius and Condor are trying to solve is the clinical trial agreement and EDC. Any client, any CRO or a sponsor who is using Medidata or Veeva as the EDC, which a lot of them are, probably most of them are, they already have the first two pieces of information that are needed to solve this problem. I just don't think that given the more flashier, the more talked about, the more jazzier parts have been, "I need my next EDC to look like this," or "I need my EDC and CTMS and ERP to talk to each other," or "I need to add risk-based management into my EDC so that I can beat Medidata."

I think they've just had their hands full with all that. When it comes to financial management, especially these two companies, based on what I know of them, they've been very clinically-focused, rightly so. They're just not being financially focused. Are they going to be? I don't know. If they are, what then would make versus buy be a better decision? Probably I just go and buy.

## Client
I know these are very theoretical questions. You were expressing a perspective that they've had low motivation in the past. Do you feel if these companies, Auxilius and Condor, started to gain market share and customers began to talk about this, that given their position in the market, these EDC products, they would pay attention to this more, and then to your point, potentially make a decision on whether to build this themselves or to buy it?

## Expert
There absolutely could be. They are still growing decently. If you tell them that by adding this one more module onto your already existing suite of products, this is going to give you another 2%, 3% of incremental top-line growth, 5% of with IBM years, why not? I don't know about Auxilius and Condor financials, but I couldn't imagine that these guys are making $50 million EBITDA today and be like $1 billion exit. Again, all theoretical numbers, but absolutely these guys are an unlock revenue from an area of clinical trials which has already existed but most nobody has paid attention. The moment you shine a light on something, it's there for the world to see.

Maybe a little bit on the market climate and the regulatory environment. We entered into the survey some specifics around PCAOB, Sarbanes-Oxley, FASB. It seems to be your perspective that these products were not must-haves now, but maybe they would become more important as regulation increased. I'd love to get more information from you. First, is that true or false? If it is true, what types of regulations are increasing the need for a product like this?

## Expert
Based on recent articles that I have been reading in the Journal, it looks like the current administration is all for reducing the regulations around the gas standards. Whether that happens or not, I don't know, but less regulation means in theory, less need for these products. I don't see these products as just compliance oriented products. Like I said, in order for anyone to run a reliable, responsible, well-thought out clinical trial, you need to handle your funds with maturity.

That's what these guys are doing now. As part of it you become audit ready, you become complex compliant to the next gap regulation. Great, perfect. In terms of the current rules, I am not 100% sure that especially the financial statement regulation is set to dramatically increase or be very different from what it has been in the past. If decent administration views are to go by, they might actually decrease some of it which is counterintuitive to my profession, but that's what I've been thinking.

## Client
Could you help me understand the conversation around loosening regulations in this industry?

## Expert
I think in the last year or so there have been multiple turnover in the SEC. Something in the Wall Street

**Journal that's accessible.** At one point I think there were some articles and these are just maybe more opinion-based articles as opposed to anything. From some of the analysts that we see here, we oversee the private company side of things might actually not be one of the favorites with the new administration. Questions being raised on, do we even need somebody like a PCAOB oversight? Those are the things which are making me say some of these items that I need.

**Client**
To summarize, there is an evolving conversation around the need for a body like the PCAOB in this industry?

**Expert**
Not just this industry. PCAOB in general, it is going to impact all of us, like all private companies.

**Client**
Is that something that you've been tracking more of? Is there significant conversation happening around that where it looks likely, or does it just seem like it's a conversation but may not in fact be likely?

**Expert**
With the new administration, my friend, your guess is going to be just as, so I really don't know. Like I said, just few initial articles. Overall, the sentiment was not just PCAOB or SEC or GAAP-specific. Overall, just the general sentiment in the newspapers that we all have access to is, we need less regulation. What does that mean? Nobody knows. Is that actually going to happen? I don't think anybody knows. if it really does happen, when will it happen? At least I couldn't tell you. If I had answers to at least few of those questions, I most likely would be sitting in a much different chair than I am today.

**Client**
Right. If you were to put on your software investor hat and look at Condor and Auxilius and the category they serve, what would have you interested and excited to make an investment in this category? What would give you concern or pause to reconsider investing in this category?

**Expert**
One of the things that I'd be excited about, which I've already called out, is this financial management of clinical trials has been an underserved area as it comes to any technological innovation. the whole clinical trial industry in general has technical debt on it. That's, again, because of the historical nature of regulations, the resistance to change and whatnot. Specifically financial management for clinical trials has always been left to, "I'm going to hire a bunch of analysts." In the end, they're going to just put their head down and reconcile a bunch of invoices and off you go.

That use case, lightning, liquidity, high interest rates, still a lot of interest in a lot of good science, meaning lots of investments still to be made. Generally, the world needs to be healthier. These would all be things that would get me excited. Things that would give me a little bit of a pause is, Auxilius has a product, Condor has a product, or XYZ has a product. Will there be or can there be a more, better, faster, cheaper AI-generated solution that then maybe can replace some of these products, or can come on top and undercut some of these products? These are things to be answered.

I think Auxilius, for example, has been integrating AI into their offering. To what extent? I don't know. Who's to say that there might be another start-up tomorrow who basically comes in and say, "I want to totally rewrite this and there's going to be AI who's going to be calling EDC, who's going to be calling clinical trial agreements." Which by the way has got its own regulatory hurdles, but once you do that, then basically the whole game becomes really easy. Those would be things that I contemplate in terms of thinking about investing in something like this.

**Client**
On the AI topic, my understanding is these solutions are building out their offerings as young start-ups and the idea is to automate some of the work and workflows for those in the accounting and auditing fields in

## Conversation on AI in Biotech

**Client:**
biotech. On the incumbent side, Veeva and Medidata, do you think that AI would make a build conversation more feasible for them versus a buy, or where would your AI concern mostly rest around a new young company building this quickly and increased competition from other young companies versus the risk of a big company like a Medidata building this out instead of deciding to buy it, because AI can assist them in doing that?

**Expert:**
Actually a combination of both, to be honest with you. There is still a lot of room in this industry for some of these things to coexist. To the extent that the Medidatas and the Veevas of the world, they continue to find ways to incorporate AI in their clinical products that they already have the lion's share of the market in. If they can do that, that to me becomes like a step one of solving the problem that Auxilius and these guys are solving. That would be a concern. On the same side, if there is another start-up who comes in and basically has nothing, no revenues, but super great technology.

If I'm a Veeva and I'm trying to basically incorporate AI in my own workflow, I might as well go with that technology to say, "Here I've got an AI enabled solution that I can tweak, play with, deploy it on my clinical, and probably it's going to solve some of my aspirations on financial management." A lot TBD at this stage when it comes to AI, because quite frankly there's not a lot of proven use cases hypothesis on the usage of AI in the clinical side and on the financial management side of clinical trials. We ourselves are contemplating some which we recently announced on LinkedIn. To answer your pointed question, it's a combination of both.

**Client:**
If you were to describe, based on your knowledge of Auxilius, how would you describe the perfect client for someone like Auxilius or Condor?

**Expert:**
A biotech company that has cash runway for at least the next three to four years, has good science, has proven their drug in the early phase, phase I and probably phase II clinical trials, and now is doing phase III and then on to phase IV clinical trial. That would be an ideal client, in my opinion, for an Auxilius or Condor.

**Client:**
To your knowledge, what percent of the total amount of sponsors out there would fit into that bucket? They have cash runway, the trial is going well and it's proceeding.

**Expert:**
Number one, your starting population for that bucket should be the zero to $500 million company. In that bucket, I'd say about 35%-40% companies could/should fit in that time frame in that filter. It is broad, but generally, that's where that how it might play out.

**Client:**
Do you think if the trial does not go from phase I to phase II, that would be difficult to continue a relationship with a company like Auxilius or Condor? Would you agree with that?

**Expert:**
The whole point of the relationship is a trial. If I don't have a trial, I don't have a relationship. If my compound A is not going from phase I to phase II, I don't have a relationship with Auxilius on that compound. When compound B is going from phase II to phase III, or phase I to phase II, I might. That's why I said an ideal candidate would be somebody who got multiple trials going through trials.

**Client:**
How common is it for these biopharma firms to have financing issues or fundraising issues?

**Client**
It is common, okay. Just to zoom out a bit on the industry, our understanding is as you mentioned earlier, higher interest rates, higher liquidity needs, and also coming from the COVID period, there seems to be an increase in demand for clinical trials. I'm curious to your experience, do you feel like the industry is set for a growth phase or do you feel that there are challenges ahead which may create turbulent times for the industry?

**Expert**
I get asked this question almost every day by internal, external, and colleagues like yourself. I give everybody the time. We are all human beings. Inherently, we are trained that after night there's going to be a morning, after dark there's going to be sunrise. The first half that we've had in calendar 2025, it has been very dark. It has been, because the new administration's view on clinical trial funding has been very different from the previous administration.

**Client**
Less government stimulus?

**Expert**
I'd say almost non-existent government stimulus to the extent that government action was impeding even a lot of private funding that people were thinking of making. Government stimulus was a very big component. NIH, BARDA funds basically dried up. Almost started to come back up, but then, with all this instability with all the tariff conversations going on, many sponsors basically took a pause and everybody was like, "Let's wait, let's see how this plays out. Let me figure out what does this tariff mean for me? What does this mean for my supply chain? What does this mean for my manufacturing?"

You put all of those into your plate and basically you've got a dish that doesn't sound very good, that doesn't look very good, it's all dark. Everybody said, "Alright, let's wait and hold," basically in the first half of the year, which led to a lot of delayed trials, cancelled trials, reprioritized trials and what have you, on top of government funding really drying up. With all of us human beings, having gone through all that in the first six months, we've all been hoping and saying, "All right, there's nowhere else for this to go, it's going to go up. It should look better." Again, these are crystal ball questions that I don't have a clear answer.

**Client**
How significant is the government's role in this industry? For example, I'm trying to understand the material impact to an administration that is both loosening the regulatory requirements but also stepping back from its financing role and then also creating hesitancy from the private market to invest further in the market. How much of a hit would that be to the biotech industry if the current administration continued to execute on what it has signaled so far?

**Expert**
Any biotech that is reliant on government funding to fund their research basically has to go and seek alternative sources of funds.

**Client**
Is that anecdotally? Is that 10% of market, 20% of market, or greater or less?

**Expert**
The government pulling their hands out of the funding has about 30%-35% of its financial hit. More than the financial hit, it creates havoc and panic and anxiety across the market.

## Client
That 30%-35% of financing from the government is decreasing, and that is now also discouraging other private investment in the market. That previous estimate of the zero to $500 million market, 1/3 of those are in a good position, they're advancing in discovery phases, they're financially healthy. That may decrease further in the current environment we're creating here?

## Expert
If we continue down the same path that we have been in the first half of the year, then yes. Recently in the last 30-45 days, we have seen some of those programs which were put on hold by the government. In the first two quarters of the year, they have been reinitiated. That's a sign that things might be moving in a better direction.

## Client
Got it. Now to take this back to earlier when I asked you, how would you look at the positives of an investment in this category and the concerns, how would you weigh those two against each other? I'll outline a few from what I've heard from you today. On the positive side, automating manual work, reduced errors, reduced cost for FTEs and mostly humans doing this today is providing opportunity for software to automate it.

On the negative side, an uncertain regulatory environment, an uncertain financing environment, how would you weigh those two? Are the negatives outweighing the positives, where you may pause and wait, or do you believe the positives outweigh the negatives and you would still move forward at the current juncture?

## Expert
I would still move forward because of two reasons. One, I believe in the real gap that these solutions are trying to address. Two, yes, the government stands and the macro environment are creating more of an anxiety than anybody would want, but then at the same time, if you've got the means to do it, that might get you a better multiple. I'm saying that very anecdotally it might not. Some of the recent multiples have been super high. It would really depend on how these individual companies are performing. That's what it's going to be.

**Sean Doolan**
sd@virtuevc.com

## Client
You would want to price in the risk. You would say I remain excited about the long-term opportunity, but given the current market uncertainty, if I could price in that risk and get a "good deal", then I would be in favor of that. Is that correct?

## Expert
Yeah.

## Client
Okay. What if you were not getting a discount for that risk and you were paying a high price to get into the market? Would you view that as excess risk at the time, given the uncertainty, or do you think that the opportunity still would warrant paying a high price, no discount for the market uncertainty?

## Expert
It really depends on what type of capital do I have. What are my levers? I'm sure an investor size is managing things out of a port, four year out of an LP. I think there's way more triggers that need to be accounted for to answer that question, as opposed to some just individually saying, "If I don't get a good deal because the market, I'm going to walk away." I don't think that that's the right way to look at it.

## Client
Last question, is there anything that we did not ask you today that you think we should have asked you? Just given the conversation we've had and what you've gathered from what we're trying to assess, or maybe any other final thoughts on things that we did not cover?

# Expert
Just a few things that maybe I expected because the screeners and stuff that you might have wanted to ask a little bit more about the individual strength and capabilities of somebody who's seen the products. Usually whenever I get on a call like these people do ask me a little bit more about Greenphire, if that's one of the things that they compete against, what are the relative strength and weaknesses of the Auxilius and Condor products as opposed to Greenphire.

Some people have also positioned the conversation as Greenphire being the North Pole and then everybody else coming around it. I don't know if that's how you guys are approaching it, but some more specifics on those tools. Other than that, from a strategic standpoint, based on what I gather you're trying to assess this for, I think we touched on everything else.

# Client
That makes sense. I very much appreciate your insight. Thank you and have a great day.
