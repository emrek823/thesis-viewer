### Investment Strategy - Multi-Product Healthcare AI Approach

- Comparing multi-product platforms vs. single-threaded solutions
	- Integration capabilities becoming key differentiator
	- Platform approach allows customization without deep domain expertise
	- Risk mitigation: if not investing in point solutions, rationale supports broader platforms
- How to compare multi-product companies:
	- Integration focus and capabilities
	- Beginning of foreseeable future positioning
	- More fine-tuned reasoning for multi-product advantages
- Competitive timing considerations
	- Wave of AI commoditization happening simultaneously with complex technical challenges
	- Hospital consolidation creating demand for unified solutions
	- Customer perception of “white glove service” achievable through rapid customization
- Market arbitrage opportunity
	- Healthcare buyers don’t appreciate speed of AI advancement
	- Competitive advantage in deployment speed vs. customer expectations
	- Enterprise AI deployment for healthcare as positioning strategy

### Current Deal Evaluations

- Dart Investment Analysis
	- Team: Viraj leading with strong technical foundation
	- Revenue: Million+ contracted ARR, showing scalable revenue potential
	- Technical differentiation: Fine-tuning, LLMs as judge, clinical annotations
	- Customer success: 5,000-10,000 discharges vs. competitors’ 2,000-10,000
	- Funding needs: $30M requirement questioned - comparison to Will Yin’s path
	- Go-to-market: Half-assing approach, need structure and Nashville scene engagement
	- Timeline: Purposely slowed Q4 to serve existing customers, now re-accelerating
	- Proposed terms: 2 on 20 (starting lower, realistic middle ground)
- Standard Model (SMB) Evaluation
	- Leader: Kevin (30s, deep domain expertise in biology and model fine-tuning)
	- Business model: Outsourced engineering for pharma fine-tuning
	- Immediate needs: $4M contract requiring compute front-loading ($50-200K cushion)
	- Differentiation: Not surface-level apps, genuine technical depth
	- Founder assessment: Higher confidence in Kevin’s sales ability vs. Dart team
	- Proposed terms: 1.5 on 15 (potentially up to 2 on 15)
- Fleet Opportunity
	- Current position: $3.2M from NIH, potential $5-10M additional government funding
	- Multi-entity structure: Spinning off 2-3 separate businesses from NIH work
	- Leadership: Samir (strong technical) and Nabil (CEO, mixed feedback on availability)
	- Previous offers: Term sheets from Abstract Ventures at $50M valuation - declined
	- Government funding reducing VC dependency
	- Strategy discussion needed on turning $2M into $30-50M outcome

### Next Steps

- Immediate Actions
	- Text Dart team post-meeting to maintain momentum
	- Get Standard Model materials for Wednesday discussion
	- Sonic reference call for Kevin’s evaluation
	- David at J&J outreach for additional references
- Process Items
	- Kevin sends materials for doc review (similar to Dart process)
	- Don’t engage Anke until Kevin approval secured
	- Fleet Friday call to discuss full business rundown
	- Q2 LP update completion (waiting on Peter’s input only)
- Strategic Positioning
	- Both deals represent “new way to build healthcare business” thesis
	- Large position strategy: 8-10% ownership targets for significant partnership
	- Move fast on closings to avoid extended process risk
	- External press coordination with Light Spun and other portfolio companies
