# FDA Deregulation Creates Infrastructure Moats, Not Enforcement Arbitrage—Invest in Embedded Platforms

**The take:** Trump 2.0 FDA deregulation is real and accelerating (RWD barriers removed, wearables exempted, AI CDS loosened). But the investment opportunity isn't in companies that benefit from lax enforcement—it's in infrastructure platforms that become embedded in regulatory workflows and persist regardless of administration. Datavant, Flatiron, Veeva, and Sentinel-ecosystem companies win. Companies dependent on enforcement discretion face whiplash risk.

**Confidence:** HIGH on deregulation scope; MEDIUM on durability of specific guidance.

## What's Actually Happening

### Deregulation Actions (January 2026)

**Real-World Data:**
- FDA removed requirement for individually identifiable patient-level data in RWD submissions ([FDA Press Release](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-eliminates-major-barrier-using-real-world-evidence-drug-and-device-application-reviews))
- Commissioner Makary: "You can submit whatever real-world data you want now in your FDA application"
- Only 12 drugs over 14 years previously included RWE due to "onerous" requirements
- Drugs moving from default two trials to "one really well-controlled, statistically powerful trial"

**Wearables & AI:**
- FDA issued updated General Wellness guidance at CES, exempting low-risk wearables from premarket requirements ([STAT News](https://www.statnews.com/2026/01/06/fda-pulls-back-oversight-ai-enabled-devices-wearables/))
- Blood pressure, glucose, SpO2 estimates now exempt when "intended solely for wellness uses"
- Clinical decision support software providing "sole medical recommendation" can now be exempt
- WHOOP blood pressure warning letter effectively reversed by new guidance ([MedTech Dive](https://www.medtechdive.com/news/fda-exempts-wearable-ai-features-guidance/809099/))

**Drug Approval Acceleration:**
- "Plausible mechanism pathway" enabling 1-2 month approvals with AI under National Priority Voucher Program
- Biosimilar and generic complex drug approvals accelerated ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/29/fda-to-speed-up-generic-drug-approvals-as-trump-targets-drug-costs.html))
- 10-for-1 rule requires FDA to cut 10 regulations for every new one ([RAPS](https://www.raps.org/news-and-articles/news-articles/2025/2/trumps-10-for-1-order-puts-pressure-on-fda-to-find))

## The Investment Framework: Permanent vs. Reversible

**The critical insight:** Not all deregulation is created equal. Some changes become embedded; others reverse with the next administration.

### Permanent (Invest Here)

| Change Type | Why It Persists | Examples |
|-------------|-----------------|----------|
| **Infrastructure investments** | Once built, becomes institutional dependency | Sentinel System (138.7M members), Common Data Models (OMOP) |
| **Scientific standards** | Bipartisan commitment to "gold standard" evidence | Computable phenotypes, data validation requirements |
| **Industry adoption** | Once pharma reorganizes around new workflow, costly to reverse | RWD infrastructure integration |
| **Platform network effects** | Data moats compound | Datavant (500+ institutions), Flatiron oncology network |

### Reversible (Avoid Dependency)

| Change Type | Why It Reverses | Risk |
|-------------|-----------------|------|
| **Enforcement discretion** | Can be withdrawn instantly | WHOOP-style warning letters return |
| **Guidance documents** | Published without notice-and-comment; revoked same way | Wellness wearable exemptions |
| **Executive orders** | Next president reverses Day 1 | 10-for-1 deregulation mandate |
| **Personnel changes** | Makary replaced; career staff preferences reassert | Accelerated approval philosophy |

**Source:** [Clinical Leader analysis](https://www.clinicalleader.com/doc/navigating-fda-regulatory-changes-policy-shifts-deregulation-restructuring-and-future-oversight-0001) explicitly warns: "Enforcement discretion should be viewed as a temporary opportunity, not a license to delay compliance readiness."

## Who Wins

### 1. RWD Infrastructure Platforms (HIGH CONFIDENCE)

**Thesis:** [[Real-World Data Infrastructure Becomes Pharma Critical Path—Data Quality Beats Volume by 2028]]

**Why deregulation accelerates this:**
- FDA removing RWD submission barriers creates DEMAND for quality infrastructure
- Requirements remain for computable phenotypes, data validation, audit trails
- Raw data is now submittable—but useless without quality layer

**Companies:**
- **Datavant:** 500+ institutions, 60M records, PPRL infrastructure ([Datavant](https://www.datavant.com/hipaa-privacy/datavant-supports-fda-guidance-with-a-privacy-first-approach-to-using-real-world-evidence-for-regulatory-decision-making))
- **Flatiron Health:** Oncology RWD network, Roche-owned
- **Veeva:** Regulatory submission infrastructure + RWD tools
- **HealthVerity:** Privacy-preserving linkage competitor

**Why this survives political cycles:** Once pharma rebuilds R&D workflows around RWD infrastructure, the infrastructure becomes sticky regardless of whether FDA tightens or loosens. The investment is in the plumbing, not the policy.

### 2. Sentinel Ecosystem (MEDIUM CONFIDENCE)

**What Sentinel is:** FDA's own distributed data network—138.7M members, 260 scientific papers, 120+ regulatory actions influenced ([FDA Sentinel](https://www.fda.gov/safety/fdas-sentinel-initiative)).

**The opportunity is NOT Sentinel itself** (government-run). The opportunity is companies that:
- Feed data into Sentinel-compatible networks
- Build on Sentinel Common Data Model
- Provide computable phenotype tooling

**Why this is "permanent":** Sentinel was created by Congress (FDAAA 2007). It's statutory infrastructure, not executive policy.

### 3. AI Diagnostic Companies (With Caveats)

**What changed:** Clinical decision support software with "sole recommendation" now exempt from FDA review.

**Companies affected:**
- Ambient AI documentation (Nuance, Abridge, Suki)
- Diagnostic AI (Viz.ai, Aidoc, HeartFlow)
- Risk stratification tools

**The caveat:** Guidance-level change. A future administration can re-assert oversight. Invest in companies with:
- Clinical validation data (survives re-regulation)
- EHR integration depth (switching costs)
- Outcome data moats (defensible IP)

**Avoid:** Companies whose only moat is "FDA hasn't reviewed us yet."

### 4. Consumer Wearables (LOW CONFIDENCE FOR INVESTMENT)

**What changed:** Wellness use exemption expanded to physiological parameters (BP, glucose, HRV).

**Why low confidence:**
- Guidance-level change, easily reversed
- WHOOP warning letter shows FDA can/will enforce
- Consumer companies don't build regulatory infrastructure
- Apple, Google can eat this market

**If investing:** Prefer companies building toward clinical-grade (Dexcom, Abbott CGM) over wellness-grade (WHOOP, Oura).

## How to Invest Through Political Cycles

### Strategy 1: Infrastructure Over Enforcement Arbitrage

**DO:** Invest in platforms that become embedded in regulatory workflows
**DON'T:** Invest in companies whose advantage is "FDA isn't looking"

**Test:** Would this company's moat survive if FDA re-tightened in 2029? If no, it's enforcement arbitrage.

### Strategy 2: Statutory > Executive > Guidance

| Durability | Source | Examples |
|------------|--------|----------|
| Most durable | Congressional statute | Sentinel (FDAAA 2007), user fee programs |
| Moderate | Final rules (APA process) | Medical device classifications |
| Least durable | Guidance documents, EOs | Wellness exemptions, 10-for-1 |

**Invest in companies benefiting from statutory changes.** Avoid companies dependent on guidance.

### Strategy 3: FDA Hedges (Academic Concept)

Research proposes "FDA hedges"—binary options that pay on approval failure ([NBER Working Paper](https://www.nber.org/papers/w23344)). Key finding: FDA approval risk has low correlation with market returns ("zero-beta property").

**Practical application:** Diversified healthcare ETFs + specific infrastructure bets provides cycle-agnostic exposure.

### Strategy 4: Watch Career Staff, Not Political Appointees

**The tell:** Makary sets direction, but career staff implement. CDER has seen mass departures. If career staff rebuild around new workflows, changes stick. If they wait out the administration, changes reverse.

**Signal to watch:** FDA hiring patterns, career staff public statements, implementation timelines.

## Does This Create a New Thesis?

**Current state:** 2 sources identified (FDA wearables guidance, Medicare AI cardiac imaging).

**Assessment:** This is NOT a distinct new thesis. It's an **accelerant** for existing theses:

1. **[[Real-World Data Infrastructure Becomes Pharma Critical Path—Data Quality Beats Volume by 2028]]** — FDA RWD deregulation is the mechanism
2. **[[Medicare Reimbursement Unlocks AI Cardiac Imaging—Preventive Cardiology Becomes Standard Care by 2028]]** — CMS payment + FDA loosening creates dual unlock
3. **[[Healthcare AI Stack Wins Through Infrastructure, Not Models—Input Structuring, Integration Depth, and Output Validation by 2028]]** — AI CDS exemptions accelerate but don't change moat dynamics

**Recommendation:** Add FDA deregulation evidence to existing RWD thesis rather than creating new "deregulation thesis."

---

## Bull Case

- FDA infrastructure investments (Sentinel, RWD guidance) become embedded before administration change
- Pharma reorganizes R&D around RWD, creating sticky demand for infrastructure
- Quality requirements persist even as submission barriers drop—infrastructure moat intact
- CMS aligns with FDA on RWE acceptance (dual regulatory unlock)

## Bear Case

- 2028 election brings re-regulation; guidance reversed Day 1
- Career staff exodus means no institutional memory of reforms
- High-profile safety event (AI misdiagnosis, RWD-approved drug failure) triggers backlash
- Pharma doesn't actually adopt RWD at scale; traditional trials remain default

---

## Recommendations

1. **Update RWD thesis** with FDA deregulation evidence—this accelerates the timeline
2. **Monitor Sentinel ecosystem** for investable companies building on FDA infrastructure
3. **Avoid enforcement arbitrage plays**—consumer wearables benefiting from guidance only
4. **Watch for first NDA with RWD as primary evidence**—the regulatory precedent signal
