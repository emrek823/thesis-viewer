## Slide 8: Background
Background

## Slide 9: Health plans spend $100MM's on manual medical coding with poor results
## Health plans spend $100MM's on manual medical coding with poor results
* Retrospective Medical coding is core to health plan revenue, driving $2.5B of ARR
* But is highly manual, expensive, slow and of poor quality.
* Coding has historically been difficult to automate
    * It requires interpreting unstructured text, context, and detailed requirements
    * Traditional ML handles context poorly, resulting in too many false positives
    * Traditional ML does not generalize, requiring constant updates as rules change

## Slide 10: We leverage AI for better, faster, cheaper and more compliant results.
## We leverage AI for better, faster, cheaper and more compliant results.
* Our solutions are built by payor experts, and inject seamlessly into existing workflows
* Our tech is built on language models, making it input format agnostic
* Our platform is designed to rapidly adapt to new use cases; we can begin with new processes with a human in the loop, and transition to automation as the platform learns
* Our platform natively generates specific documentation, providing significant audit resilience

## Slide 11: Product Sequence
## Product Sequence
We plan to stage out product development and launch:
* Opening wedge is retrospective risk adjustment
* HEDIS abstraction is a quick adjacency
* Moving to support other risk adjustment activities (eg. suspecting, concurrent review, etc.)
* Ultimately expanding into all payor use cases built on clinical data (prior auth, UM, claims, clinical engagement, payments, cohorting, etc...)

## Slide 12: Market Size Breakdown

## Slide 19: Examples
## Examples
Website
Video Demos

**Right Knee Replacement (1)**
Z96.651
Presence of right artificial knee joint
Maybe
AI Review Rationale: The code Z96.651 refers to the presence of a right knee joint prosthesis. The chart mentions that the patient has a history of a right knee replacement, which could justify the use of this code. However, the primary focus of the encounter is a psychiatric evaluation, and the knee replacement is not directly relevant to the current visit's primary concerns or diagnoses. Therefore, while the code could be appropriate to include in the patient's overall medical history, it may not be necessary for this specific encounter unless the knee replacement is impacting the patient's mental health or treatment plan.

**Chronic Back Pain (2)**
M54.5
Low back pain
Unlikely
AI Review Rationale: The code M54.5 corresponds to 'Low back pain.' The chart primarily focuses on a psychiatric evaluation for depression and anxiety, with no specific mention of low back pain as a current issue. Although the patient has a history of chronic back pain, it is not highlighted as a primary concern in this encounter. Therefore, coding for low back pain in this context seems unlikely to be appropriate.

**Hypertension (3)**
I10
Essential (primary) hypertension
Definitely
AI Review Rationale: The code I10 corresponds to essential (primary) hypertension. The chart mentions 'BP+ - Hypertension Confirmed' under the Problem List section, which directly indicates the presence of hypertension as a diagnosed condition. Therefore, the use of the code I10 is definitely appropriate for this chart.

**Generalized Anxiety Disorder (1)**
F41.1
Generalized anxiety disorder
Definitely
AI Review Rationale: The code F41.1 corresponds to Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). The chart indicates that the patient has a history of generalized anxiety disorder and is currently experiencing symptoms such as excessive worry, anxiety, and irritability. These symptoms align with the diagnostic criteria for GAD, making the code F41.1 definitely appropriate for this chart.

*Channel partnerships with no direct revenue

## Slide 27: Key Product Learnings from Active Pilots
## Key Product Learnings from Active Pilots
* Modeling creates unique advantages on data ingestion
    * Customers have poorly organized clinical charts -> developed metadata extraction processes to allow for more focused coding efforts
    * Customer charts are often combined into enormous documents -> developed algorithmic document splitting to allow for model ingestion
* AI Co-Piloted Humans outperform Expert Coders
    * When we introduced the second pass AI review with generated rationale, our expert coder changed ~5% of her prior conclusions
    * Therefore, our product as it stands today is creating a new standard of excellence; and it will only improve from here
* Although not yet tuned for 5 digit ICD10 codes, our AI first pass already operates at 90% recall. Human alone was only 86%.
