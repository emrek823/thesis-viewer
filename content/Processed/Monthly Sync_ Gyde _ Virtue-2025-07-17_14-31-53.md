### Team Building & Talent Acquisition

- Tech org up and running with 2 engineers (one from Stripe, one from Oscar)
- M&A leadership close to hire: Dan from AccraSure (was there for $100M to $5B growth)
	- Case interview Monday with Will and Sam
	- Well-referenced by multiple parties
	- Handles both BD sales and traditional M&A work
- CTO search shifting focus post-M&A hire
	- Target for Series A, not immediate need
	- Preference for Ramp or Palantir backgrounds
	- Need exceptional talent using AI day-to-day
- Executive search firm engagement recommended
	- True Search (Ryan Lupo connection through Will)
	- Diversa as alternative
	- Advantage: balance sheet allows premium search partnerships

### Deal Pipeline & Strategy

- Design partners providing product feedback without acquisition conflicts
	- Enrollment stores, Davidson camps, RF Masters representative of target level
	- Some larger targets like IKEA would be expensive
- New market segment identified: younger, tech-savvy brokers from life insurance
	- More aggressive sales approach with door-to-door and direct mail
	- Hybrid model: field + telephony + lead purchasing
	- Higher sophistication than traditional Medicare brokers
- Deal size preference: 2 smaller targets over 1 large
	- More option value and momentum demonstration
	- Trade-offs: operational complexity, higher deal fees
	- Key criteria: owner as spokesperson, recruiter, future deal closer

### Product Development & Market Validation

- V1 product targeting Q4 launch
- Strong early signals from design partner conversations
	- Universal pain points identified across prospects
	- Current tech stacks described as “horrible”
	- Automation of renewals alone would provide material lift
- Revenue impact expected by end of Q4
- Integration risks remain but confidence increasing

### Series A Preparation

- Lightspeed feedback: CTO with AI background critical for narrative
- Pipeline more important than closed deals for Series A story
- Target: demonstrate ability to execute 10 deals with $100M funding
- Key risks over next 6 months:
	- Q4 timing challenges (brokers focus on core work)
	- Product integration complexities
	- Design partner engagement levels
