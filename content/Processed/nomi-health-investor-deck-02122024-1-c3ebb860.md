## Slide 4: PROBLEM - 65% of Americans are covered under employer self-funded plans. Employers are shifting rising costs onto employees.

**% of Americans Under Self-Funded Plans**

**Chart: % of Americans Under Self-Funded Plans**

| Year | Percentage |
| :--- | :--------- |

| 2006 | 55.0%      |

| 2014 | 61.0%      |
| 2018 | 61.0%      |
| 2022 | 65.0%      |

**Unsure what else to-do, employers are increasingly looking to shift costs to employees.**
Likelihood employers will consider each type of strategy to minimize costs

**What is a self-funded employer?** In the United States, employers can elect to forgo the traditional insurance industry and directly cover healthcare costs themselves, backstopped by a re-insurance carrier.

**STATUS QUO**
**Where does the $40 go?**
**Invented complexity.**
RCM² costs, write offs, denials, collection fees, co-pays, network rental fees, call centers, payment rails, claims adjudication, and merchant fees.

| | Buyers pay | Providers collect | Time to get paid |
| :--- | :--------- | :---------------- | :--------------- |

*   **No Patient Responsibility**
    *   Hospitals attribute more than 50% of their commercial bad debt to unpaid patient bills due to the rise of HDHPs³
    *   Providers trade lower upfront rates with Nomi for increased profitability and better operating leverage
*   **No Prior-Auth Burden**
    *   100% of experts prioritized the prior-auth burden as a financial and admin challenge
    *   We eliminate this step, saving providers $ and improving overall satisfaction
*   **Immediate Payment**
    *   Hospitals are traditionally paid within 60 days of service (at best), though sometimes wait as long as 9 months
    *   By fulling settling in near real-time, we give the providers greater predictability into their cash flow

**Nomi Health Self-Funded Model**
Up to 30% (or more) in savings with reduced volatility YoY.

**Bar Chart: Nomi Health Self-Funded Model (PMPY)**

| Category           | PMPY Value | Change from previous |
| :----------------- | :--------- | :------------------- |
| Trad PMPY          | $5,500     | -                    |
| Network Savings    | $4,400     | $(1,100)             |
| Rx Savings         | $3,940     | $(460)               |
| Admin Savings      | $3,880     | $(60)                |
| Nomi PMPY (Final)  | $3,880     | -                    |

*Calculations based on $5,500 initial Trad PMPY:*
*   Network Savings: $5,500 - $1,100 = $4,400
*   Rx Savings: $4,400 - $460 = $3,940
*   Admin Savings: $3,940 - $60 = $3,880
*   Nomi PMPY: $3,880

## Slide 18: Our sales motions involve working directly with employers and with like-minded distribution partners.

**NOMI OWNED SOLUTIONS**

**BUYERS OF HEALTHCARE**
*   Self-Funded Entity
*   Employer

**CHANNEL PARTNERS¹**
*   Stop-Loss
*   Captive
*   TPA
*   Broker

**KEY**
Channel Partners who double as Solution Partners

Some Channel Partners have complementary solutions to ours.
Nomi therefore is a distribution partner to our **Solution Partners.**
As our Partners grow, we grow.

**Going Direct**
Jumbo employers (50K+ employees) often work directly solution providers, as they have the in-house expertise to evaluate.
Our direct relationships with Boeing and Amazon highlight the strong relationships that can be built directly.

**Strategic Partnerships**
Most employers have relationships of trust with brokers, TPAs, and other healthcare players.
By working with these players, we benefit from their organic member growth YoY, adding new members at little to no S&M cost.
**Example:** We are Mercer's preferred analytics provider; as Mercer adds lives to their book, we add lives to our analytics platform.

¹See appendix for how our model differs from the traditional while still leveraging key channel partners

| Year | Revenue ($M) |
| :--- | :----------- |
| 2022 | $276         |

| 2024 | $677         |
| 2025 | $1,410       |

*CAGR 72% (from 2022 to 2025 approx.)*

**Table below chart:**

¹Not inclusive of revenue from pandemic operations; ²EBITDA % on NRR, not inclusive of historical COVID EBITDA

**2024 Key Growth Drivers**
*   **Network:** Launching our Full Network Replacement product on 04/01/24 which captures 100% of medical spend.
*   **Pharmacy Management:** Caesars, Orchestra, and Wynn among the 100k lives that went live on 01/01/24.
*   **Analytics:** Mercer implementations and market expansion to Stop Loss, States, and TPAs through Global Solutions team.
*   **Financial Services:** Implementation, onboarding, and execution of signed TPA deals.
*   **Integrated Programs:** CareSource implementation with high patient engagement.

**What is NRR and how do we calculate it?**
We supplement the traditional financial metrics with **Net Reoccurring Revenue (NRR)**, which strips out pass-through costs common in healthcare and reflects the highly predictable revenue that is common in technology businesses.

Revenue of Each Business Unit
– Drug Spend from Pharmacy Management.
– Medical Spend from Network
= **Net Reoccurring Revenue**

## Slide 28: Appendix

**Nomi Health**

## Slide 29: By consolidating the number of partners needed, we align incentives and allow information to flow freely.

**Traditional Plan Build**

**Employer**
-> **Broker / Consultant**
-> **Plan Admin. (TPA)** (1, 3, 2, 4)
-> **PBM** (1, 3, 2, 4)
-> **Analytics** (1, 3, 2, 4)
-> **Medical Network** (1, 2) (from Plan Admin.)
-> **Payment Services** (1) (from Plan Admin.)
-> **Stop-Loss** (1, 3, 2, 4)
-> **Point Solutions** (1, 3, 2, 4)

**Plan Build with Nomi**

**Employer**
-> **Broker / Consultant**
-> **Nomi Health**
    *   **Nomi Health Analytics** (1, 3, 2, 4)
    *   **Nomi Health PBM** (1, 3, 2, 4)
    *   **Nomi Health Plan Admin. (TPA)** (1, 3, 2, 4)
        *   **Nomi Health Medical Network**
        *   **Nomi Health Payment Services**
    *   **Nomi Health Stop-Loss** (1, 3, 2, 4)
    *   **Nomi Health Point Solutions** (1, 3, 2, 4)

In the traditional plan build, employers and their partners are faced with an array of options in each category. Brokers often request bids and vet multiple PBMs, networks, and analytics and payment services platforms. The Nomi plan build offers a streamlined solution and integrations with partners options, reducing the optionality and complexity.

## Slide 30: Our cost savings in action: Saving employer plans 30% on their health spend.

**Status Quo**

| | Employers Pay Payers | For a Network Rate of | Providers Get Paid |
| :-------- | :------------------- | :-------------------- | :----------------- |
| **Status Quo** | $115                 | $100                  | $75                |
*Time to get paid: 2-9 Months*

**With Nomi**

| | Employers Pay | For Nomi's Network Rate of | Providers Get Paid |
| :------- | :------------ | :------------------------- | :----------------- |
| **With Nomi** | $88           | $80                        | $80                |
*Time to get paid: Same Day*

By removing co-pays, deductibles, and utilizing a simpler prior-authorization structure we negotiate industry best network rates with providers

**SUBSEQUENT VISITS AND PHYSICAN REFERRALS**
*   > 150M+ physician referrals annually
*   This leads to **multiplicative effect on costs**, which are exacerbated under status quo model.
*   By **controlling the access layer**, we can ensure physicians refer to only high-quality, low-cost providers.
