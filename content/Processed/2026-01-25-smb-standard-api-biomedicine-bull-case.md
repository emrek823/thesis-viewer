# SMB at Scale: The Standard API for Biomedicine

## The Bull Case in Two Sentences

**If SMB becomes the standard API for biomedicine—the infrastructure layer that pharma, biobanks, and health systems call for patient-level predictions—it looks less like a biotech ($500M-$2B outcomes) and more like Databricks for biology ($10B+ outcome).** The right mental model isn't a neocloud (GPU arbitrage) or vertical SaaS (workflow software), but a new category: **domain-specific foundation model infrastructure** with Physical Intelligence ($5.6B for robotics) and Databricks ($134B for data/AI) as the closest comps.

---

## Three Supporting Arguments

### 1. Platform Infrastructure Commands 20-30x Multiples—SMB's Architecture Enables This

Databricks trades at **28x ARR** ($134B on $4.8B revenue) because it's not selling software—it's selling the infrastructure layer that makes AI workloads possible. Together AI reached **$3.3B at 25x revenue** ($300M ARR) by becoming the inference layer startups call instead of building their own. Physical Intelligence hit **$5.6B** with $300/robot/month SaaS pricing because they're "Android for robots"—hardware-agnostic software that every robotics company needs.

SMB's architecture positions it for the same dynamic. Their JEPA foundation models create a unified embedding space across EHR, imaging, genomics, and pathology—the patient-level equivalent of Databricks' lakehouse architecture. Just as Databricks became infrastructure pharma, healthcare, and financial services all call for data workloads, SMB could become the infrastructure every organization calls for patient-level predictions. The 6 AMC partnerships (MSK, MD Anderson, Yale, UCSD, Mayo, Mount Sinai) and federated learning infrastructure are the early data flywheel that Databricks built with Spark. At scale, this isn't a $5M/year Sanofi contract—it's hundreds of organizations paying for API access to patient-level predictions.

**Comp math:** If SMB reaches $100M ARR with platform economics (recurring, multi-customer, network effects), Databricks-like multiples suggest $2-3B valuation. At $300M ARR (Together AI territory), $7-10B becomes plausible.

### 2. Model Licensing Creates SaaS Economics in Biotech—SMB Is Positioned for This Arbitrage

The GSK-Noetik deal ($50M for 5-year model license) and Chai-Lilly partnership prove pharma will pay recurring fees for foundation model access—not milestone-gated biobucks. This shifts AI biotech from **3-5x biotech multiples** to **10-15x SaaS multiples** on identical revenue. Chai Discovery raised at $1.3B with zero approved drugs; that's software economics.

SMB's model licensing approach (Sanofi $4.8M pending, IQVIA $10M+ proposal) captures this arbitrage at the patient level. The key insight from Scale Venture Partners: "The real money is in advancing your own drugs"—but the real *multiple* is in avoiding drug development risk entirely. SMB licenses prediction capabilities, not molecules. Each new pharma customer adds recurring revenue without clinical trial exposure.

**The math:** Traditional AI drug discovery deals (Recursion-Roche: $150M + $12B biobucks) require Phase II success for full value. SMB's model licensing collects upfront + subscription regardless of clinical outcomes. Same $50M ARR achieves $150-250M at biotech multiples vs. $500-750M at software multiples—**2-3x valuation arbitrage**.

### 3. "API for Biology" Is the Missing Infrastructure Layer—SMB Fills This at the Patient Level

BioLM's thesis captures a real gap: "Biology in the 2020s has the data, the compute, and the engineering talent to be revolutionized much like software was in the 2000s. What's missing is the glue—simple RESTful APIs and interoperability." Ginkgo offers protein FM APIs. NVIDIA BioNeMo provides molecule/omics APIs. Benchling provides workflow APIs.

**No one provides patient-level prediction APIs.** This is SMB's strategic position. Tempus has the data ($350+ PB connected clinical data) but needs SMB for foundation model capabilities—that's why they're in discussions for a $4-6M partnership despite genomics being their core strength. The "API for patient-level biomedicine" is genuinely unoccupied.

At scale, this looks like: pharmaceutical companies POST a patient's multimodal data (EHR + imaging + genomics) and GET back treatment response predictions, adverse event risks, and trial eligibility assessments. Health systems call the same API for clinical decision support. Biobanks call it for cohort selection. The infrastructure becomes invisible—everyone just calls the SMB API.

**Historical parallel:** Plaid aggregated 12,000+ financial institutions via a single API, enabling fintech innovation by lowering barriers. The first company to offer reliable, standardized patient-level prediction APIs becomes "Plaid for clinical AI"—and Plaid sold for $5.3B to Visa (deal collapsed) / now valued at $13B.

## The Right Mental Model: Not Neocloud, Not Vertical SaaS

| Category | Example | Business Model | Why SMB Is Different |
|----------|---------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Neocloud** | Together AI, CoreWeave | GPU arbitrage, inference infrastructure | SMB isn't selling compute—they're selling domain-specific model weights trained on proprietary healthcare data |
| **Vertical SaaS** | Veeva, Benchling | Workflow software, seat licenses | SMB isn't selling workflow tools—they're selling prediction capabilities via API/model licensing |
| **Biotech** | Recursion, Insitro | Drug pipelines, milestone-gated revenue | SMB doesn't develop drugs—they license models with recurring revenue |
| **Domain FM Infrastructure** | Physical Intelligence, (SMB) | Foundation models for specific domains, hardware/data-agnostic | ✓ SMB provides patient-level FM infrastructure pharma/health systems call for predictions |

**Physical Intelligence is the closest comp.** PI is "Android for robots"—a hardware-agnostic foundation model layer that works across robot embodiments. SMB is "Android for patient predictions"—a data-agnostic foundation model layer that works across healthcare systems, therapeutic areas, and data modalities. PI charges $300/robot/month; SMB could charge per-prediction or annual platform fees.

**PI's trajectory:** $70M seed → $400M Series A ($2B) → $600M Series B ($5.6B) in 18 months. If SMB follows similar milestones (first major pharma deal, multiple customer deployments, expanded use cases), $2B+ valuations are achievable.

## Valuation Implications

| Scenario | Revenue | Multiple | Valuation | Rationale |
|----------|---------|----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Conservative** | $50M ARR (5 pharma × $10M) | 10x (healthcare SaaS) | $500M | Healthcare platform average |
| **Base** | $100M ARR (10 pharma + health systems) | 15x (platform premium) | $1.5B | Benchling-level trajectory |
| **Bull** | $300M ARR (standard API adoption) | 20x (infrastructure) | $6B | Together AI comparison |
| **Outlier** | $500M+ ARR (ubiquitous infrastructure) | 25x+ (Databricks territory) | $12B+ | "Databricks for biology" outcome |

**Key unlock:** The jump from "base" to "bull" requires SMB becoming default infrastructure—not just a vendor pharma licenses, but the API everyone calls. This requires:
1. Multiple pharma customers (3+) validating the platform
2. Health system deployments for clinical decision support
3. Biobank partnerships for cohort selection
4. API standardization that makes SMB the easiest option

## What Would Make This Real

**Near-term (2026):**
- Sanofi closes at $4-5M
- 2+ additional pharma customers (IQVIA, AstraZeneca, GSK)
- Health system pilot for clinical decision support

**Medium-term (2027-2028):**
- $50M+ ARR from model licensing
- API standardization (documented endpoints, predictable pricing)
- Federated learning infrastructure enables multi-institutional access

**Long-term (2029+):**
- SMB becomes default for patient-level predictions
- Pharma R&D budgets include "SMB platform fees" as line item
- Health systems integrate SMB API into EHR workflows
- IPO or strategic acquisition at infrastructure multiples

## Risks to the Bull Case

1. **Pharma builds internally.** Lilly TuneLab shows pharma can build AI capabilities. If build beats buy at patient level, SMB becomes a vendor not infrastructure.

2. **Data moat doesn't compound.** If AMC partnerships don't produce differentiated training data, SMB's models become commoditized.

3. **Competition from Tempus/Epic.** Tempus has 350+ PB of clinical data; Epic has EHR install base. If either builds patient-level FMs, SMB faces well-capitalized competition.

4. **Clinical validation required.** If SMB's predictions don't improve trial outcomes, pharma won't pay infrastructure pricing.

5. **Single-customer concentration.** If Sanofi represents >50% of revenue for 2+ years, SMB is a services company, not a platform.
