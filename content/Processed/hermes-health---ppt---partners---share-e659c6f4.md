## Slide 7: Problem: Limited Demand, High Overhead

# Problem: Limited Demand, High Overhead

## Serving the Long-Tail of Requestor is Hard
*   **Limited Demand**
    *   Managing the longtail of Requestors adds admin burden and compliance risk—with little return.
*   **High Tech Burden**
    *   Most Requestors can't implement your APIs, let alone work across multiple vendors.
*   **Lack of Standardization**
    *   Every request is different—making intake automation tough and scaling expensive.

**Chart: Record Requests vs. Customers (Long-Tail Distribution)**
*   The chart shows a distribution where a small number of customers generate a high volume of record requests, while a large number of customers generate a low volume of requests (the "long tail"). The y-axis is "Record Requests" and the x-axis is "Customers".

## Slide 8: Solution: Hermes Unity Platform

# Solution: Hermes Unity Platform

## Hermes Unity Platform
*   **Unified UI:** Platform and API that enables Requestors to compliantly submit and receive requests for identified data requests.
*   **Unified Partner Integrations:** A robust backend that delivers identified back to Requestors by integrating with Partners.
    *   50 ROI Vendors
    *   500 EHR Vendors
    *   100 RWD Sources

**Diagram: Hermes - Middleware Architecture**

*   **Bottom Layer (Partner Integrations):**
    *   ROI Vendors
    *   RWD Sources
    *   EHR Vendors
    *   Clinics

## Slide 9: More Revenue, Less Cost, and Scalable Intake

# More Revenue, Less Cost, and Scalable Intake

## Value to Partners
*   **More Demand: More Revenue**
    *   Hermes simplifies for Requestors the process of requesting and receiving medical records inducing demand for your data.
*   **No Tech Burden: Less Cost**
    *   Hermes handles integrations with Requestors so you don't have to manage one-off tech support or maintain multiple custom interfaces.
*   **Scalable Intake: Less Cost**
    *   Every record request arrives in a single, standardized format via Hermes—regardless of who sent it. That means lower operational cost, faster routing, and simplified scaling.

# Network Flywheel Effect

## Two-Sided Marketplace
Hermes Health connects Requestors with Partners creating value for both sides:

*   **Partners Benefit Via:**
    *   Increased Requests from Requestors increasing Partner revenue.
    *   Reduced fulfillment costs by switching Requestors to API submission vs Fax.

*   **Requestors Benefit Via:**
    *   Simplified record submission and delivery increasing, enabling increased demand for more requests.
    *   Improved turnaround times.

## Slide 17: Hermes Reduces Your Legal Exposure

# Hermes Reduces Your Legal Exposure

## Contracting & Liability
Hermes signs agreements with both the Requestor and the Partner.

*   **Requestors attest that HIPAA Authorization submissions are valid and accurate.**
*   **Partners attest:**
    *   That they have the right to release identified medical data assuming a valid HIPAA Authorization.
    *   That they are releasing the correct data for the patient requested
*   **Hermes Health attests that patient data is securely handled and transmitted to the appropriate party.**

**Diagram: Liability Flow**

| Party         | Attestation                                                     | Liability                                  |
| :------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------- |
| Requestor     | Attest that HIPAA Authorizations are Valid and Accurate         | Holds the Liability for Inappropriate Record Submissions |
| Hermes Health | Attest that Patient Data is Secured and transmitted to the appropriate party | Holds the Liability for Inappropriate Record Disclosures |
| Partner       | Attest that Records released are for the patient requested      | Holds the Liability for Inappropriate Disclosure |

## Slide 18: Solution: How it Works

# Solution: How it Works

## First Neutral API for Identified Health Data
The Hermes Health Unity Platform connects Requestors to a growing network of Partners—including ROI vendors, EHR systems, and RWD providers. How it works:

*   **Secure Intake:** Requestors securely submit patient's full name, date of birth, and a signed HIPAA Authorization form.
*   **Smart Routing:** The Unity Platform then routes these requests to our network of Partners.
*   **Partner Fulfillment:** Our Partner networks processes these Requests and securely transmits identified patient data back to the Unity Platform.
*   **Delivery:** The Unity Platform securely delivers the data back to requestors without revealing Partner-specific infrastructure or exposing individual Partner details, protecting privacy, and confidentiality
*   **Transparent Pricing:** Each Partner is paid a clear, per-record fee to keep pricing simple and aligned.

**Diagram: Hermes Health Unity Platform Workflow**
*   **Requestor:** (Top box)
    *   "Secure Intake" and "Secure Delivery" (Two boxes below Requestor, connected to Unity Platform)
*   **Unity Platform:** (Main central box)
    *   Connects to "Secure Intake" and "Secure Delivery"
    *   Connects to "Partner Route Engine" (to the right)
    *   Connects to "API Delivery" (to the left/bottom)
*   **Partner Route Engine:** (Below Unity Platform, to the right)
    *   Connects to "Partner (ROI, EHR, or RWD)"
*   **Partner (ROI, EHR, or RWD):** (Below Partner Route Engine)
    *   Connects to "Facility" (to the right)
    *   Connects back to "Unity Platform"
*   **Facility:** (Rightmost box)
*   **API Delivery:** (Below Unity Platform, to the left)
    *   Connects to "Patient Data" (to the left/bottom)
*   **Patient Data:** (Bottom left box)
*   **Patient Data Retrieved:** (Bottom right box, connected to Partner (ROI, EHR, or RWD) and Patient Data via API Delivery)
