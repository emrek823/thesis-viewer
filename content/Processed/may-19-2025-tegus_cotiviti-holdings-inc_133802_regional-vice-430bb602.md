## Expert Details
Regional Vice President, Payer Market at Optum. Expert was also Vice President, Payment Integrity at Optum, until December 2024.

Regional Vice President, Payer Market at Optum.

Former Vice President, Payment Integrity at. Optum, leaving December 2024. The expert is the business lead for all of Optum's payment integrity clients and is responsible for maintaining these relationships. The expert works across all products/solutions (around 15) and is the key point of contact for these clients. The expert's role is focused on general operations, renewals, and working with sales to support new growth. The expert has spent over a decade at Optum in leadership positions and can speak most relevantly to payment integrity.

The expert can speak to the payment integrity space, as well as payer market.

**Q: Can you speak knowledgeably about the payments integrity space and overall market size?**
A: Yes, I've been managing a big chunk of our PI business at Optum.

**Q: Can you speak to the role that software plays for payors when it comes to managing payments integrity?**
A: Yes. Software plays a large role, especially as you move more to the pre-pay space vs post-pay, which was the historical way PI was done. It's used for claim editing, claim selection for audit, using AI models looking for duplicates, etc.

**Q: Can you speak to the opportunities for AI to disrupt existing, more manual driven processes across payments integrity as a category?**
A: Yes, in some ways it already is. My company is deploying models for finding claims that are more likely to displace bills. Can help price claims, identify claims, help a payer be more self-sufficient in running own PI efforts, etc.

## Client
Thank you for your time. I am trying to better understand the payment integrity landscape and how it works. What I'm really looking to understand is obviously Optum and Cotiviti have a meaningful stronghold on the market, but trying to understand how large is the market opportunity not just within subrogation but expanding beyond that? Is there a potential for a next-gen AI player to come in and build a next-gen solution here? Maybe just to kick things off, can you share a little bit of background on yourself and your role?

## Expert
Sure. I've been working with payers for 20+ years since I came to UnitedHealth Group. The last five years have been spent working with some of our largest commercial payers and focus on payment integrity. My current role is regional vice president of the payer market. I have other domains that we cover including risk adjustment, analytics.

## Client
When you say regional vice president of the payer market, that means that when payers are buying software solutions from Optum, you run that side of things in your region?

## Expert
Yeah. They're our customers. I've been working with some of the largest payers for the last five years around their payment integrity needs, understanding the PI market, both prepay and postpay and software included. The whole gamut. When you mentioned at the beginning, not just subrogation, I don't know if that's a focus of yours or not but that's a very small piece of the overall value market etc. that's in payment integrity.

## Client
Got it. How should I think about the size of the payment integrity market and the primary verticals within it?

## Expert
This is across the market, if you wanted to really size it, if you looked at medical spend there's probably 5% opportunity pretty normally across payment integrity programs. If a company's payers medical costs are $10 billion, then that payer alone probably has an opportunity to potentially save up to $500 million on all of their programs.

That gives you a sense of "Okay, well then what do they pay for that?" You have contingent fees, noncontingent fees, etc. If you were just to pick a percentage of savings, even if it wasn't a contingent fee arrangement, you're probably in that because you have some license agreements on the software side, you have some contingent fees that might be in the high 20s. If you picked like a 15% idea on that, vendor spend for that company with $10 billion in medical costs could pretty easily be, if you're saving them potentially across all vendors, $500 million times 15% of that, that's probably their spend.

You could probably do some back of the nap, look at how big the market is. Obviously, as you get to smaller payers, their fees as a percentage of what they say might go higher because there's fixed costs to run those types of programs that get spread amongst fewer members. Your second part of your question, I believe was how do I look at that market? Or the different verticals are divided?

## Client
Yes. Can you maybe just close the loop on market size, would you say it's roughly 1% of medical spend?

## Expert
If you're talking what we get to bill our payers, yes. If you counted what they're trying to save, obviously that's the 5%. I think that's a good gauge. From the vertical perspective, I tend to look at it as prepay programs and postpay programs. That doesn't mean it's how everybody looks at it. Once you're in the postpay vertical, then you have things like data mining, provider audit or ERG audit, whatever you want to call it. Hospital bill review and subrogation is obviously one of the big ones.

---

COB is another one, credit balance. There's others as well. Those are the postpay programs that most vendors and or payers have, whether they're internal or external. On the prepay side, there's a lot of different things. You have pricing software, you have claim editing software, you have prepay claim validation, which is like an audit of all the claims before they get paid. You have various components within that where you're looking at facility, outpatient, professional, ER. There's a lot of different things that you can focus on in that prepay space and each one might have a different offering as to how you help a payer tackle that and find savings.

## Client
Got it. Maybe just to close the loop on market size. If we were to say, whether it's Optum or Cotiviti or this mythical new AI solution, if they're able to capture 1% of healthcare spend and healthcare spend in the U.S. is $4 trillion-$5 trillion, that's like $40 billion-$50 billion is what the theoretical market size would be?

## Expert
That seems high when you put it that way. I think part of it is there's a lot of dollars that don't ever go through PI programs. It's like how many of them have robust programs? The market potential might be high, but the actual market is probably nowhere near that. People are maybe half utilizing, but even half of that seems large.

The other part is you have TPAs and smaller self-insured employers and things like that. They don't really do as much. Optum or other companies like Cotiviti aren't going to target them as much because there's just not a return on investment to invest the infrastructure and fixed cost to build a program for someone with 100,000 lives. That might decrease it. I was spitballing there, but I've never heard whatever billion number you just said because I'm pretty sure that that'd be way, way high.

The other component of that that maybe makes the actual market a lot smaller is the insourcing that payers do of a lot of those functions like COB and that might be one of the biggest savings levers. They're spending money internally, but it's not in an external market.

## Client
Yeah. The largest payer like Aetna, let's just say they are doing more and more in-house to save money and then the teeny-tiny payers can't afford it or aren't worth the headache and you're losing both people at the top and at the bottom.

## Expert
Absolutely. I just had one client today that wanted to look at an option to do a couple of different things and we're like, "Well, if you're willing to pay X amount for the implementation fee, we could put our solution in." The amount of savings you're going to generate for the fees we're going to charge for us to spend that amount up-front for a two or three-year contract, that doesn't make a lot of sense. We're not going to get a return.

That's where a lot of players are looking is how do you make things less intrusive and more automated using software or AI or whatever you want to use that doesn't require as many humans or as much implementation effort. Just establishing those data feeds and getting them in the right format, that takes a lot of effort on the side of the payer and the service provider.

## Client
Got it. Maybe going to that AI opportunity, Optum's obviously built a really big business here as has Cotiviti. Do you think there's the opportunity for an AI-first next-gen player to come in and build a big business?

## Expert
I do think there will be, yes. I think they have to figure out the data part, but that's what they do. I would expect that there's going to be someone coming in. The other part of it that just barrier to entry that makes it a challenge is who you're going to get. You're going to need a relationship of someone that's willing to take that leap and you might not supplant the other people right away.

---

It might be like a second pass or come behind someone and see what you can find because no one wants to just turn it off and move to another vendor and then it doesn't work and you're out all that money. You look foolish. They're going to want to try before they go deep. I think there are opportunities for that and I think a lot of firms are trying to do it.

## Client
Yes. As you think about wanting to try before you buy, are there typically paid pilots or how does that work? Are they typically saying, "Hey, come do this for free for a year?"

## Expert
I think they say "We'll pay you, but you are going to be second pass."

## Client
Can you double-click on that or explain more?

## Expert
Let's say we're doing data mining, which is we're running different analytics and algorithms on your data to find overpayments, duplicates, things like modifiers or claims don't pay a certain way, but they are paying it, i.e. mistakes that a payer is about to make or did make if it's postpay on how they paid the claim because they missed the duplicate. They missed the fact that they build with a modifier and they shouldn't go or whatever. We have rules, analytics, engines, etc. that find that kind of stuff.

There might be an AI player that comes in and says, "We have a better engine, we have a better mousetrap. We can do this for you. Use us." They'd say, "Well, we're not going to put you in a first-pass position, but you can look at the same data 30 days after Cotiviti does it." This is if you're doing a postpay. "If you find more dollars, we'll even pay you a higher fee," because they didn't find it. You're getting the older stuff and it takes more effort and it's not as likely that you're going to succeed because you're looking at stuff that's already been reviewed. "If you find us dollars, we'll pay you for it."

If they have a better mousetrap, then they should be able to come in behind Cotiviti and find that. You can do second pass on a prepay basis as well. It just becomes a little more complicated because you don't want to slow up your payment cycle because you have prompt pay rules and other things that you need to make. If some AI provider is coming in to look at those claims on a prepay basis, they have to be able to turn around in 24 hours, and they might come in behind Cotiviti or Optum or whoever, and they get a chance to look at it. If they find something the other one didn't find, then they get a crack and they earn a fee. That's what second pass is.

It's really no risk to the payer. It's a little more work. They're just saying, "Oh, now we got to send them the data, we got to wait for their response or we got to do this." Reality is both vendors are working for them. One with more upside because they're first, the other one with maybe less upside. If they have a better mousetrap, it still works out for everybody.

We call it vendor stacking. There's a lot of that that goes on in the industry because why not? You're already establishing these data feeds, especially postpay. Why not stack a couple vendors and see, at some point there's a diminishing return and you have to process all these adjustments, etc. The AI vendors, if they can do it more automated, then it might not be that much work for you as a payer. Paying some fee for whatever they find works pretty well.

## Client
Got it. What would define a next-gen winner? Why would they win or how would they win? What would they need to do?

## Expert
I would say next-gen winner gets in the prepay space and finds a way to save that money up-front for them in a way that's less intrusive and less costly than other vendors in that space right now. It could be moving

---

further upstream. We talk about things like denial prevention, what if you didn't even have to audit that claim and deny it?

What if you could provide some software to the providers that have payment policies and things built into it that tell them this claim's good, it should get paid? Now, they don't even have to go through that cycle. They don't have to file appeals, they don't have to do all that stuff because the software is helping them on the front end. That's something you could sell to providers.

For payers, the easier you can make it and less work to help them pay less money. The value prop is huge because it's not something they have to guess on what we saved. They can see it, they can feel it. I think that's why they're going to win, is they make it less intrusive. The other side of it is, there's something called provider abrasion in this space.

Whereas if you do too much auditing and too much denials and too much taking of money back from providers, they're going to get mad, they're not going to like it. Is there an opportunity for provider education at the same time where you can teach them software or whatever it is, that helps them code better so that again their claims get paid, they don't get denied.

## Client
What would define a next-gen winner and why do they win? It sounds like a lot of it is coming down to being in the prepaid space. Am I correct in understanding today most of the revenue is generated in postpay and so it's just moving earlier or how should I think about that?

## Expert
I think we call it shifting left, but it's moving more to prepay. I would say savings right now might be more slanted toward prepay. If you looked at a program in total, subrogation is a hard one. You have to establish who has liability. In a car accident, for example, is it State Farm or is it Allstate or is it the health insurance company? Most likely it's not the health insurance company because it was a car accident.

It might take a couple months before the auto companies determine who's at fault. That's when you can start to pursue your subrogation case if you're the payer and go after State Farm or go after Allstate, whoever it is. It's hard to move. Not saying you can't, because you don't know what's going to happen for a while in the subro space.

In things like COB, where you're trying to identify other coverage or things like just your standard inpatient visits, etc. Providers don't like you clawing back money on these large inpatient admissions. The more you can move prepay, the better. There's definitely a shift left. I would say it's tilted right now. Probably, more prepay than postpay, but not by a lot.

## Client
Got it. If there were a next-gen player here, an AI-focused company, let's say starting in prepaid, how big of a business do you think it could become if they're the winner?

## Expert
I would say it could become a couple hundred million.

## Client
In revenue?

## Expert
Yeah. It's going to take a while, but I'm sure there are plenty of companies out there that have a hockey stick forecast that takes them to $200 million. You need some large payers. Let's say you're charging a lower fee. Let's say you say "We can do this for $0.12 contingency. Everyone else charged you $0.18-$0.20. We can do it for $0.12." You save them $10 million. That's a pretty big customer you can save that amount for. Your fee is only $1.2 million. It's going to take a while and you have to have other solutions.

---

## Client
Got it. Do you think a business as large as Cotiviti could be built by someone?

## Expert
Organically, I think that would be pretty tough to do. I think over time through acquisitions and growth, yeah why not? I would be surprised if they said, "Wow, this company just grew their revenue by that much." They'd have to combine or acquire something else to grow that quick. Even 100% growth for quite a few years. If you start out at $1 million in revenue, it takes a while.

## Client
Got it. Most of the growth in this market has been through acquisitions?

## Expert
For the bigger players, I agree. I think there's also been some growth. I think the market in total has been fairly moderate as far as growth goes over the last 10 years.

## Client
Got it. Any other questions I should be asking?

## Expert
I would say, the AI vendors, how do they grow? What are the ways they could grow? Part of it might be being acquired or signing partnerships where there's revenue sharing with some of the bigger deals, because what they might not have is a distribution channel. You haven't really asked about that. How do you get a product out there? What relationships do you have? How do you become big?

If I was running one of those companies, you're going to look at, "Well, I don't want to give up my equity. I don't want to lose that. I want to grow this company." That doesn't mean you couldn't look and say, "Where is their distribution channel where I can go find partners who have relationships I don't have?" It's a win-win. They bring me in, they get some of the revenue. "I now have referenceable clients of this size or that size. I now have consistent revenue streams. I'm building connections at the largest level of payers."

## Client
Got it. Thank you for taking the time to speak with me. Have a nice day.
