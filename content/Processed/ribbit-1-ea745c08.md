Ribbit Capital

Dear Partners,

"Context is worth 80 IQ points" - Alan Kay

Since the start of Ribbit, one question has helped us get to know founders and their companies better than any other: "Who is your customer?"

While unnerving to ask if you're trying to look smart, it turns out to be a great way to cut to the chase. The more often you ask it, the more you start to appreciate the logic of its simplicity. While the language of transactions (pay! lend! borrow! save! insure!) dominates, doing any of these things is meaningless without context about who is doing them. Knowing your customers – and grasping their motivations around money - lies at the core of creating value in financial services.

Money is a social construct, used to some end, so we can't understand it without data on the people or entities involved. Who paid whom? Who owns what? Who owes what? Who is creditworthy? Many of the best entrepreneurs we've met have blown us away with their clarity around how they plan to help a specific customer live or work better. Asking founders about customers is always a good reminder for us that the starting point of finance is not transactions, but rather identity.

But understanding your customers in a digital age is not straightforward. This letter is about that challenge and opportunity - both about identity in the narrow sense (how do people and businesses prove who they are?) and in the broader sense (how do people and businesses share context about themselves?). We believe that the technologies and business models built around improving identity will help usher in the next phase of transformation in financial services.

## The Identity Opportunity

Since the start of Ribbit 12 years ago, we have seen profound progress in how people access and use money. The combination of smart phones, cloud computing, and new payments infrastructure has helped bring digital finance to billions of people around the world. But as our systems for transacting modernize, our systems for identity are falling further and further behind. Today, you can make a payment with your phone or card virtually anywhere in the physical or digital world, leveraging an interconnected web of global financial networks. And, yet, if you want to identify yourself on a website or apply for a financial product, you will find yourself taking pictures of your passport and rooting around the house for old bank statements. When you step back and consider the status quo for identity, it's hard not to wonder how we got here:

## The Digital Identity Frankenstein

If you're like us, these stats are chilling because of how familiar they feel (be honest: did you have to reset your password to access this letter?). They also give a glimpse of why - despite living in a world where we all have banks in our pockets - we still regularly face frustrations with financial services. When something isn't working smoothly in finance, a good rule of thumb is that an identity problem likely lurks underneath. Why hasn't your payment shown up in your sister's bank account in Mexico? There is an issue with a compliance check. Why is it so time-consuming to originate a mortgage? Your lender is struggling to verify your employment. Why can't you maximize yield easily in a rising rate environment? Your new account is stuck in a KYC queue and your transfers are hitting fraud triggers. Why is your bank of 22 years asking for your name and address when you click on "get a credit card" in the app? They don't have unified identity between divisions of the bank. Once you start to see it, you can't stop: identity is the invisible force enabling or preventing almost everything that happens (or doesn't happen) in digital finance.

But thinking about identity as a problem is not what motivated us to write this letter. We started working on this letter because upgrading identity is a key piece of how we get to better money – money that is smarter, more accessible, and far more personalized – around the world. Today, while a digital bank or wallet might be faster, cheaper, easier, or more unbiased, a local banker still has a leg up when it comes to knowing a customer and offering tailored advice. But we are in the middle of an intelligence revolution in computing that holds the promise of bringing this level of care to everyone on earth (perhaps even without the nasty conflicts of interest that have plagued finance for centuries). For this to work in financial services - for AI to help enable better money - we need to have safe ways to share context about who we are and what we want and need.

In another decade, it will be obvious that knowing your customer has shifted from a compliance requirement to a defining pillar of innovation in finance. This is already true in commerce and media, where the largest businesses in the world - Meta, Amazon, TikTok, Mercado Libre, and others - are, at their core, identity companies. Bringing this level of identity insight to financial services, where risk, compliance, and consumer protection is sacrosanct, will require new technologies and business models that balance the need for ease, security, and customer control. There is a lot to build.

The entrepreneurs and companies that meet the challenge stand to capture enormous value. When you start to pull on the thread, you realize how much wealth ties back to business models built around identity. The software companies that we think of today as most narrowly focused on identity – the ones we rely on to manage risk, privacy, and compliance around identifying people in financial services alone – are worth over $100B. The companies that we currently trust to govern and employ sensitive financial identity data – businesses like Experian, Equifax, FICO, and Intuit – are worth over another $300B. But even these figures vastly understate the financial consequence of identity, given its centrality to the value of so many other businesses, from the payment networks ($1T+ market cap) to the global Internet giants ($5T+ market cap).

But while there is plenty of existing market cap to go after, we are most excited about the new value there is to create. What is possible when we unlock highly personalized credit, investments, insurance, and other financial services for billions of underserved customers globally? We have seen glimpses of it the past decade. One of our favorite examples - and favorite investments of all time - is Credit Karma. When Ken, Nichole, and Ryan conceived of the company, they took a low value, poor UX business (lead gen on credit cards) and transformed it by adding context. In giving consumers access to critical identity data for free, Credit Karma created a delightful experience, aided the financial health of millions of people, and built value by helping people find the right financial products. The proof is in the pudding: Credit Karma sold to Intuit in 2020 for over $7B – more than 5x today's combined market cap for Nerdwallet and LendingTree, two commonly cited comps that lack an identity layer. And Credit Karma is far from done; we haven't seen yet what they can do with 130M+ members and rapidly advancing AI.

If upgrading identity can make the financial services industry - at $16T and growing - even a bit more efficient, it merits our time and capital. We plan to put both to work in the space. So, as always, we welcome all your questions and critiques. Every time we send a letter to our partners, we learn something from writing it - and a lot more from your feedback.

## Understanding Identity (a.k.a. What Are We Talking About Here?)

In writing this letter, we talked to a few dozen people what identity means – and we got a few hundred answers. It turns out identity is a messy concept! We often assert our "true" identity while also claiming multiple identities (work, personal, online, and offline identities, to name a few), and mean something very different when we say "I don't want to lose my identity" compared to "I don't want to lose my ID." We are as likely to hear the word identity used by sociologists talking about acceptance in society as we are by facilities vendors talking about access to buildings.

When we talk about **identity** at Ribbit, we are focused on all the data about a person (or business) – both the basics (e.g. name, date of birth, biometrics) as well as the universe of information ranging from personal preferences to experiences to financial profiles. Identity today includes both what we are used to proving with analog documents (e.g. the birth certificates, passports, licenses, diplomas), as well as the mounting repository of information generated and collected by the digital services we use (e.g. our social media interests, transaction histories). A pragmatic way we think of this for Ribbit is that identity is all the data you might share with a trusted financial intermediary - e.g. a banker or insurance agent or wealth advisor – to show who you are and provide the context they need to help you. The "identity space" in this letter is the set of technologies and business models designed around capturing, storing, validating, sharing, and using this data to provide the context needed for more seamless and personalized financial transactions.

As we discussed at our annual meeting in October, we see many ways in which data (especially identity data) is becoming more like money. The two concepts have always been closely related; money is a ledger of who owns and who owes what, and identity is data about the people, companies, and entities on that ledger. But in a digital age, they are becoming more intertwined – for instance, money is taking the literal form of data (e.g. on blockchains) in the same moment that liquid markets for data are booming, most prominently as AI feedstock. As data becomes more like money, it is becoming more regulated, more important to secure and validate, and more than ever in need of standards to enable interoperability. Given the future we imagine - where people and companies more explicitly value, manage, and exchange data like money - we have started to frame our thinking around the identity space in the language of payments and banking:

**Identity Data Issuers** create and provide access to **Identifiers** and **Credentials**. Identifiers are what they sound like - data designed to identify a unique business, person, or other entity. Credentials are documents or information that attest to some aspect of a broader identity, ranging from basic information (e.g. name, address) to more esoteric or context-specific information (e.g. level of education, recent parenthood, if you passed an issuer's KYC process). Your DMV is an issuer of your driver's license, your employer is an issuer of your employee dossier, and Meta is an issuer of your social profiles, all of which contain a variety of credentials. Identifiers and credentials can be issued by centralized entities, using proprietary formats - for instance, government-issued identifiers like a Social Security Number in the U.S. or Aadhaar in India. Alternatively, they can be issued using open standards, typically built on cryptographic proofs; this is what people in the identity space reference as **Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)** and **Verified Credentials (VCs)**.

**Identity Data Processors (Verifiers and Authenticators)** check whether an identity is valid for the person presenting it, usually for the first time (verification), as well as whether it belongs to the person presenting it on an ongoing basis (authentication). A security agent at the airport needs to look at your ticket and ID to verify that you have bona fide, matching documents, as well as to look at you or scan your biometrics to authenticate that you are the person on those documents. In the digital finance realm, a mobile bank needs to go through an **Identity Verification Process (IDV)** at registration to ensure they know who you are, and an authentication process every time you log in or want to transact to make sure it is you again. Verification and authentication are notoriously difficult since bad actors are always looking for ways to skirt detection. To help address this challenge, a wide range of fraud and compliance solutions lend support to identity data processors.

**Identity Data Banks (or Custodians or Wallets)** store, grant, and revoke access to identifiers and credentials. While all data banks have the general function of keeping data secure and available, we expect multiple types to emerge based on operations and regulation; as a hypothetical example, an identity bank that is custodial might have no right to use or combine data, while an identity wallet might both store and enhance data. Some data banks, operating as **Reusable Identity Wallets**, will help customers aggregate identity information and bring it with them across multiple products or sites - akin to how, in an analog world, you can bring your passport with you from one place to another. Others will focus on acting as data custodians just for businesses, providing **Vaulting and Privacy Infrastructure** to keep data strictly within secure, tightly controlled environments.

Lastly, **Identity Data Standards** aim to foster coordination and interoperability across this web of entities. There are a range of organizations managing standards for identity data (e.g FIDO, OIDC, WebAuthn, OAuth2); while most are non-profits or associations, we may see standards emerge from companies, governments, or protocols in the future, as has mostly been the case in payments.

We have at least another decade of work ahead in figuring out how this value chain will operate and where value will accrue. From looking at identity and money today, we can guess at a few things:

*   Geography and industry will matter a lot. Determining with whom, how, and when you can issue, bank, or process identity data will vary widely based on regulation, data sensitivity, and risk profile (e.g. KYC/AML will require higher standards than e-commerce loyalty data).

*   Companies will defy categorization. The identity space is already littered with organizations that span across multiple categories (e.g. processors that create reusable credentials), provide services across the value chain (e.g. security tooling relevant for issuing, banking, and processing), or just defy categorization (e.g. NFT projects with identity components).
*   Value will likely be spread out, in the same way that each of issuing, banking, and processing are trillion-dollar industries in finance. Players participating in multiple parts are likely to create the most valuable businesses.
*   Businesses that absorb risk will be bigger, though those providing infrastructure will tend to have higher multiples. Controlling proprietary data will likely be most valuable of all.
*   Like in finance, trust will be very important, so tenure and brand will have a lot of value. Challengers will need to find new channels and technologies if they hope to break in.

In the rest of this letter, we'll take a stab at going a layer deeper than that to share some of our current beliefs about where we should be hunting for value – including reusable identity wallets catalyzed by AI, risk-absorbing data banks, innovative data processors with scale, data issuers and banks who align effectively with governments, data players of all kind who focus on B2B identity, and companies who approach data issuing as a new market opportunity.

## Identity in 2024 (a.k.a. Why Now?)

The need for more modernizing identity has been a constant since we started Ribbit; nearly every company we've backed has struggled with identity challenges. So, why are we focused on this now?

**The challenge of managing and securing identity data is reaching a fever pitch**
As digital finance has grown from infancy to its teenage years, the complexity of wrangling legacy identity systems is skyrocketing. Ten years ago, founders might tell us about a couple global identity solutions; today, it's common for them to rattle off a dozen vendors or more. We've seen an explosion of point solutions (email age, address checks, social validation, device fingerprinting, IP and geolocation solutions, password managers, and more), but as soon as companies plug one hole, another emerges. This is apparent in the stats: ~5% of the $60T of U.S. ACH volume is estimated to be fraudulent, card fraud costs upwards of $30B a year, and nearly 50M consumers in the U.S. alone face identity fraud. Fraud and money laundering will always be tough - defenders need to get it right every time, while offenders just need to get it right once - but the burden on consumers and businesses is unsustainable. Relying on every person or company to secure valuable identity information in the face of increasingly capable fraudsters is not a viable long-term solution.

**We are on the verge of having digital IDs in most places around the world**
One of the biggest challenges with our identity systems is that the most common identifiers around the world are still analog. This is starting to change. India has now issued 1.3B Aadhaar cards, the Philippines has issued 76M PhilDs, and Estonia has issued 1.3M e-Estonia IDs. These digital ID systems are showing their value, from making government aid faster and safer (e.g. India's direct cash transfers in 2020-21 to over 200M women with Aadhaar-linked Jan-Dhan savings accounts) to powering the growth of new public infrastructure (e.g. UPI becoming dominant in India with 10B+ monthly payments). Especially in the aftermath of COVID and the challenges it created for governments, these success cases are spurring further progress globally, from the EU introducing eID, to several U.S. states adopting the mobile driver's license (mDL) framework, to Japan growing MyNumber to over 90M citizens, to 10 countries (with 400M+ IDs) signing agreements with MOSIP, a government ID platform. While digital ID systems takes time and political will, we expect government-supported digital IDs to be commonplace around the world in ten years.

**The technology we need to address core identity challenges and opportunities is here**
As our offline identities have collided with our online lives, we have resorted to duct-taped technical solutions just to keep things together, from holding up our passports to our webcams to password protecting documents to using SMS (a notoriously insecure method) for two-factor authentication. With ubiquitous smartphones and critical gains in security infrastructure and cryptography, a viable "identity stack" is emerging: 1) widespread access to mobile biometrics (e.g. facial features, fingerprints, irises, voice) that are highly difficult to spoof 2) new techniques that leverage hardware as a factor in authentication in simple, usable ways (e.g. Passkeys) 3) gains in key management with tools such as secure enclaves (e.g. AWS Nitro) that ensure data is only decrypted in highly-fortified environments 4) developments in zero-knowledge proofs and fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), which allow for sharing provably true information without disclosing underlying data. While constant upgrades will be needed - particularly as technologies like Generative AI present new challenges - the budding identity stack is much closer to being able to deliver simultaneously high levels of privacy, security, and usability.

**Standards are emerging that will help foster innovation around identity**
With digital identities becoming richer and more valuable, we are seeing increased traction around more open and interoperable identity systems. Some examples include the W3C Verifiable Credentials model, ISO/IEC 18013-5 (being adopted by companies such as Apple for its mDL implementation), ISO/IEC 23220-2 Electronic Identification (eID), and a wide variety of blockchain-based approaches. While we don't believe that any single standard will be employed everywhere, we do see the potential for "networks of networks," like we observe in the payments space. For example, the OpenID Foundation has established OpenID for Verifiable Credentials, an attempt to enable compatibility between both these standards and common current identity infrastructure. With time - just as we have seen with Open Banking in many countries around the world – we expect considerable government and industry support for these efforts, leading to both better experiences for consumers and a range of new business opportunities for entrepreneurs.

**Pressure is building across society around the identity status quo**
We see several reasons to believe that the current situation (e.g. identity data highly concentrated with a small number of giant companies) is not at equilibrium. Data privacy, security, and sovereignty have all become major global political topics, and consumer awareness has been rising (exhibit A: Apple, arguably the world's best marketer, focusing its message on privacy; exhibit B: a small minority of Apple users opting in to tracking on mobile apps). The growth of AI - and the political discourse around it - is only accelerating societal attentiveness to data as an asset and a liability. Further, we see some models emerging that offer viable alternatives to the status quo. Estonia, which has been working on identity for two decades, provides a good template for what is possible: as part of building e-Estonia, they have 1) effected a decentralized system for storing identity information (denying hackers a single point of attack) 2) created a national security standard for data registrars and a secure data exchange layer between them (called X-Road) 3) implemented high levels of transparency, including controls that allow residents to see how, when, and why their data is accessed by various institutions. A wide range of others are seizing on similar approaches or narratives; blockchain ecosystems, for example, have attracted adherents with many of the same principals - greater user control of data, with high degrees of decentralization and transparency. While the wave is still forming, countries, institutions, and people are taking note.

## Strong Beliefs, Loosely Held

## AI could be the catalyst we need to make user-centric identity solutions a reality

Talk to enough identity entrepreneurs and you may start to believe we are all on the precipice of seizing control over our digital identities. The vision for user-centric identity comes in a lot of forms, but often starts with us collating personal information - perhaps compiling health records, family documents, or financial credentials in a safe repository. In this world, identity infrastructure becomes reusable and independent from applications; users decide what to share, when, and with whom, bringing identity from application to application - and revoking access as they see fit.

When the excitement settles down, you remember the status quo: most of our identity information is analog, scatted across hundreds of disconnected services, or secure in the data centers of a few Internet giants. By volume, the last of these is the largest, and the revolution in identity is unlikely to happen by their hands. More realistically - just as the biggest companies in the world got hold of our data by delivering applications we want and need – a change in identity systems will come when there is something new to motivate us to share information and adopt new behaviors.

Our bet is on Generative AI. It doesn't take a PhD to spot the enormous interest; ChatGPT hit 1M users in five days, and a year later has 180M+ monthly and 100M+ weekly active users, faster than any consumer application before it. And while ChatGPT and its competitors are trained on trillions of parameters to produce answers using reasoning and general knowledge, they will require user data to become hyper-personalized and capable of addressing many of our highest value needs.

While Internet incumbents have been using our identity data to guess at what we might want, Gen AI is positioned to help us directly with everything from our travel to our money to our health. Today, we commonly collect data for human agents (e.g. doctors, lawyers, accountants, brokers, travel agents), even though it is time-consuming and often repetitive. As AI agents start to become substitutes, the need to share identity information – more explicitly, frequently, and with more sensitive data than we have shared with digital services in the past - will grow exponentially.

## AI May Soon Be Using Our Identity Data To Start Working For Us

This section illustrates an AI agent conversation via mobile phone screenshots.

Imagine, for example, asking an AI agent to book a vacation for your family. The agent can collect travel data (hotels, flights, reviews, packages) from web services, but needs you to share several pieces of

Confidential

identity information, including travel preferences, historical trips, payment credentials, budgets, family composition, names, and passports. By compiling these credentials - in some cases manually, in others by API (for example, with your bank, calendar, phone) – in a reusable profile (a "data backpack," to us), you can make them available to the agent as they interact with third parties on your behalf, resulting in highly personalized trip at a fraction of the cost and in a fraction of the time. When the process is done, you can revoke information access, while adding a new experience to your data backpack. For most people, this has the potential to be a profoundly better way to plan a trip than is available today - cheaper, faster, more creative, and more informed.

While exciting to imagine, it's also not obvious that personalized agents will require a change to the identity status quo. They might, on the contrary, push us to depend even more on today's Internet giants. If Microsoft or Google already have our calendars and emails, why not just rely on them? If a new AI player like OpenAI takes market share, won't they just envelop our identity data too? This may well be the case in many instances, but we suspect it won't be the whole picture for a few reasons:

*   Incumbent internet services are unlikely to have a monopoly on Gen AI applications, just like they didn't have a monopoly on mobile applications; if history is any guide, some of the most innovative services may surprise us (CharacterAI may be a good current example).
*   The act of sharing data with agents so explicitly - and much of that data being sensitive in nature - is likely to make consumers more aware of the need for greater privacy and control. This will likely be reinforced by regulatory scrutiny of AI as a sector.
*   We will likely end up with multiple agents for different purposes (but a decent amount of input overlap) and may tire of refreshing data without being able to reuse information or control access. About a third of Americans (80M+ people) report using password managers; data backpacks could meet a similar drive for convenience and security.

While it's more fun to start with some aspiration, the jolt that gets the boulder rolling downhill may already be here: the simple need for people to prove that they are, well, people ("proof of personhood" in identity parlance). As bots proliferate with Gen AI-fueled superpowers, the need to verify the real, unique person behind a digital identity is skyrocketing. The historical default has been asking only for essential information online - losing a customer from friction was a bigger risk than a fake account or bad actor. But this trend is reversing; from social media to dating sites to games in Roblox, a range of digital services are putting a burden on users to go through onerous verifications. This sounds innocuous but could also sow the seeds of reusable identity, with personhood credentials as the first items in data backpacks that could eventually hold the troves of information needed to bring personalized AI agents to life.

The growing need for proof of personhood online may be a harbinger of bigger changes in society in an age of AI. COVID was a key moment of reckoning for governments trying to run a modern state without trusted digital identity; we may look back on 2020 as the year when we all saw identity systems like Aadhaar as a major national competitive advantage. And the challenges COVID presented to governments – i.e. not being able to deliver timely aid and administer public health programs effectively - may pale in comparison to the demands of societies facing AI. If AI creates massive productivity and wealth gains but displaces large parts of the workforce, how will we redistribute wealth? How will we do it without feeding the opportunism that led to the SBA-estimated $200B in potentially fraudulent COVID-related claims in the US alone? While consumer demand for AI agents might get us going, a major societal shift like Universal Basic Income (or some variant of the same idea) would certainly light the fire we need to modernize identity all the way through.

## Global cybercrime – and rising compliance demands – will propel the data banking industry

One of our favorite new trivia questions: what is the third largest economy in the world, after the United States and China? If you want to take the bait you can answer Japan (GDP of just above $4.2T), but we would argue a better contender these days is the global cybercrime industry. While it is hard to pinpoint an exact magnitude - most sizing comes from cybersecurity firms (and we like to heed Buffett's warning about asking the barber if we need a haircut) - a range of estimates puts the cybercrime business anywhere from $2T to $12T, making it a top 10 economy by any account.

Cybercrime is also the only global economy we all are intent on shrinking. The costs of its growth are staggering. Despite companies spending over $220B on cybersecurity, over 400M people were victims of data breaches through the first nine months of 2023. During the same period, businesses faced 70% more ransomware attacks than a year earlier, with average payments surpassing $1M. While we're still awaiting the 2023 tally, over 1.5B personal records were breached in 2022.

Despite our ill wishes, global cybercrime will keep growing for the same reason we are writing this letter: the value and liquidity of personal data is growing everywhere. If we see data as more and more like money, the status quo in data management starts to look strange; the cost, complexity, and risk of managing data is soaring, but most companies are still effectively doing their own data banking. Meanwhile, the bar for data compliance keeps rising. Over 100 countries now have data protection and privacy rules in place, and the advent of the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in 2018 has led to increasing data regulation everywhere.

The center will not hold. As businesses struggle to keep pace with criminals and regulators, we expect data banks to be some of the fastest growing identity businesses in the years ahead. Like traditional banks, data banks most sacred job will be to keep their assets (i.e. data) safe and ensure compliance. They will be paid for absorbing or reducing risk while still making data accessible to customers. Today's emerging crop of data banks offer services ranging from vaulting (isolating, encrypting, governing, and utilizing sensitive data), to identifying and separating PII from less sensitive data, to meeting the requirements of an ever-growing soup of local and international privacy laws (e.g. GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, FINRA). As in traditional banking, we will see data banking providers in a variety of shapes and sizes. Some, for example, will take direct risk holding customers' data, while others will provide infrastructure for businesses to enable self-custody.

While this is an evolving and amorphous space right now, we believe data banks have an important role to play in society and can accrue significant value over time, for a handful of reasons:

*   The largest custodians in financial services (e.g. State Street, BNY Mellon) have shown the power of trusted brands that can navigate complex regulatory and security challenges. As data becomes more valuable, difficult to secure, and plentiful - 120 zettabytes and counting per day - we expect to see willingness to pay a premium to leading providers.
*   Like regular banks, data banks should benefit from compounding. By collecting data over time - and across many businesses and industries - data banks can grow the value of their data sets super linearly. This has been true historically for third-party data businesses (e.g. credit bureaus) and nearly every data-rich Internet vendor (e.g. fraud companies who learn by tracking device usage, app usage, transactional history, etc. across clients).
*   Trusted data banks will be well positioned to sell value-added services. There is considerable value - for businesses, end users, and society - in enabling secure computation across data sets (e.g. population-level drug efficacy analysis). As we figure out how to do this safely and compliantly, data banks will be well positioned, in the same way traditional banks hold funds and offer lending, asset management, payment, and other services.
*   Data banks may be best situated to become issuers of reusable identities. Just as Shopify - a merchant-facing service - was able to build ShopPay into one of the largest consumer wallets by leveraging scale across merchants, top data banks might figure out compliant, secure ways of letting users access or bring their data across digital services. We already see promising early efforts such as Plaid's "Remember Me" and Persona's "Reusable Personas".

Who has the right to win in the battle of the data banks? Perhaps the most common view is that the future is already decided - the Internet giants already function as the world's biggest data banks, and will continue to leverage user engagement, AI prowess, and world-class security techniques (and scale benefits) to pull further ahead. While they will undoubtedly be valuable data banks, we don't see the Internet giants monopolizing the future market, because of both rising regulatory resistance and customer preferences. We expect consumers and society will simultaneously trust Google, Meta, Apple, et al to bank a lot of important data (e.g. login, communication), while largely looking elsewhere for banking additional, highly sensitive data (e.g. financial services, healthcare).

Another place we look is at developer-facing companies that specialize in managing sensitive data. Some top identity processors like Persona or Socure, who have built scale in onboarding, already handle PII and are well positioned for expanding their data banking. Other winners might start with custody from the beginning; businesses like Evervault, Footprint, and Privy are building towards a future where developers can make data more fortified (e.g. encrypted end-to-end and only accessible in secure enclaves) while still usable (e.g. for confidential computing, regulatory compliance, credential authentication), even in encrypted form. Lastly, companies that enable access to regulated data - for instance, Plaid, who has become a standard bearer in Open Banking - may have the experience, reach, and infrastructure to become data banking leaders. To win, developer-facing data banks will need to flex both technology prowess and the capabilities that matter in banking, like regulatory engagement, risk management, and branding.

One last set of contenders we wouldn't count out: the banks themselves. As you might guess, our money here is on digital leaders; a top-of-mind example is Revolut, with 30M global customers, a context-rich product, reach across consumer and SMB, and the ability to build new, AI-led experiences. But leading incumbent brands are well positioned too - already trusted by society to store critical data, to handle customer identity, and to focus on security and compliance. And they have an impressive track record of convincing regulators they have the best (or only!) solution to a problem.

## Dynamic evolution in commerce and payments will create a window for change

In September 1958, Bank of America shook up the financial services world with a move that came to be known as the "Fresno Drop," mailing an unsolicited new product, a credit card called BankAmericard, to 60,000 customers in Fresno. What Bank of America did - extending credit to a huge swath of Fresno, at a time when underwriting was done based on manual analysis and personal relationships – was considered wild. In early 1959, over 800 merchants were accepting the card, and the bank expanded to Modesto and Bakersfield. Competitors jumped into the fray; by the end of 1959, 2M cards were circulating in California, accepted by more than 20,000 merchants.

While the Fresno Drop was a catalyzing moment for the revolution to come in credit and payments, it was considered a failure at the time. A year and a half later, Joe Williams - the executive who created the program - resigned. By the time he quit, Bank of America had lost over $20M (an enormous sum then); delinquencies exceeded 20 percent, and fraud raced out of control as criminals figured out how to replicate cards. Bank of America had designed a working payments system, but an identity system that was full of holes – they had limited understanding of their customers and couldn't effectively authenticate and authorize users. But the losses were not in vain: eventually, Bank of America licensed the program to other banks and gave birth to the consortium we know today as Visa, with standards and rules around payment and settlement - and identity – that now work across over 100M merchants and 15,000 financial institutions in more than 200 countries and territories.

This pattern - where new demands in commerce lead to changes in payment systems which then create a vacuum for better identity systems - has repeated throughout history. A big part of the impetus to write this letter came from feeling we are in another one of those moments. The signs of today's pressures are mounting: the 80+ countries who have launched real-time payment systems in recent years; the rampant growth of live social commerce (approaching $700B in China and $50B in the U.S.); the ongoing rise of supply-limited auctions that feel more like high-frequency trading than shopping; the intensifying battle with bots wreaking havoc on all kinds of commerce (e.g. bots driving 40% of concert ticket traffic). In each case, people and businesses – and software programs working for or against them – are moving money faster, more frequently, and with more urgency.

Against this pressure, the cracks in our identity infrastructure are showing. In most incumbent payment systems (e.g. cards, ACH), payments settle after multiple days - a valuable buffer when it comes to detecting and mitigating fraud. Without that buffer, new forms of fraud are on the rise: in India, almost 100,000 UPI fraud cases were reported in 2022, and Brazilian bank estimates cite 70% of

new fraud cases as being associated with PIX. Over two-thirds of financial institutions reported an increase in mule transactions, account takeovers, and authorized push payment fraud via real-time payment rails in 2022. While many payment schemes and providers are working on better guidance and rules in key areas like authentication and disputes, there will continue to be an acute need for monitoring and fraud solutions – just ask the millions of designated VIP Taylor Swift fans who showed up to Ticketmaster last November to find their Verified Fan codes failing.

The first line of defense - and, to us, perhaps the most obvious investment opportunity - are companies like Stripe, Stark, dLocal, Plaid, Checkout, Stitch, and Razorpay (to pick some Ribbit favorites!) that help developers and businesses meet the demands of real-time commerce. These companies are fintech businesses with identity businesses under the hood. By being on the front lines of commerce and payments - with the most identity data across the broadest array of transactions – they are well positioned to grow their own ARPU while helping customers adapt to the changing landscape by absorbing fraud risk, providing fraud solutions, and bundling identity in other ways (e.g. credential tokenization for their customers - and their customer's customers).

But the magnitude and shape of identity challenges presented by faster payments and commerce will demand other innovative solutions. We see multiple potential shifts and opportunities:

*   AI is amplifying the challenge of catching identity up with commerce and payments. Tools for generating media are catnip for criminals, who have been quick to weaponize AI for fraud (e.g. creating synthetic identities, optimizing phishing scams, spoofing influencers, catfishing users). Data from fraud vendors matches with anecdotes we hear across the portfolio; Sift reported, for instance, an 800%+ year-over-year increase in account takeover attacks in fintech in Q2 2023. Battling identity fraud is a game of cat-and-mouse; we will need companies that can fight AI with AI. Identity processors and fraud tooling (e.g. Sardine, Persona, FaceTec, Hive, AI or Not) are poised to grow quickly if they can help quell the fire with pioneering work on behavioral data, liveness detection, device fingerprinting, and AI detection. One important note: companies have historically managed key risk workflows (e.g. onboarding, AML, fraud, credit) in siloes. Winning AI solutions will likely be built on real-time access to all this data; AI-native decisioning engines (e.g. Oscilar, Taktile) have a platform-size opportunity.
*   While firefighting is important, real-time everything in an age of AI also creates a window for more radical rethinking of identity workflows. The first steps are straightforward but important – contending with the need for better authentication. While two-factor has become widely adopted, common methods like email and SMS verification face growing vulnerabilities. Technologies that leverage now-ubiquitous biometrics and hardware (namely, WebAuthn and Passkeys) hold the promise of both better security and usability. For leading digital identity processors, being at the cutting edge of implementing them could turn out to be a massive wave.
*   As transactions and commerce speed up, today's model for maintaining customer information is outdated, especially in financial services. Right now, banks and fintechs perform customer due diligence (CDD) at onboarding and again at mandated annual intervals; this is costly (some banks spend $500M+ annually!), lagging, and often annoying to customers. A new paradigm - using automation and integrations to do perpetual KYC (pKYC) – makes a lot more sense for the modern world. Bringing pKYC to life requires tackling hurdles in technology, data governance, ops, and UX, but promises to dramatically reduce fraud and operational costs. Most importantly, being up to date with your customers is just good business. Companies that enable this - that see pKYC as a means to solve for compliance, but also to strengthen customer value and LTV - stand to reap huge rewards.
*   One of the reasons fraud and money laundering are so tough is that attackers leverage their work, using the same schemes or stolen credentials on multiple targets. In all our identity work, the single biggest unfulfilled wish from founders and operators was for collaboration. Nearly

every operator we spoke to across identity spoke wistfully of how powerful more data sharing could be; real-time payments challenges would be far easier to tackle with a network-oriented approach, where companies could share, for example, instances of a suspected or verified account takeover, or the flagging of a synthetic ID. As businesses to build or invest in, consortiums get our frog senses tingling, usually for the wrong reasons – they often sound great on paper, but in practice die a slow death due to challenges around coordination, governance, and mixed incentives. At the same time, some of the world's most valuable pieces of financial infrastructure were born out of complex forms of cooperation between multiple parties (e.g. Visa, Mastercard, SWIFT, NYSE). If the pain is great enough, there is a chance to get everyone to row in the same direction. The brewing cocktail of real-time payments, commerce, fraud, and AI may be just what's needed; we are closely following early efforts led by Plaid, Sardine, and others.

In short, the world is changing fast. We are going to need identity to keep pace.

## Governments will play a big role, including shaping where value is created and captured

Identity is far more essential than it is visible. This is part of what makes the identity space so tricky to approach as an innovator or investor. While modernizing identity is imperative all of us in a digitizing world, people don't really think about their identity unless they have a pressing need. The last two decades have shown us that you can monetize identity data if you build an application that collects it. On the other hand, they've also shown us how difficult it is to convince consumers to act with the explicit value proposition of optimizing or controlling their identity.

We've covered some of the things that might bring more consumer focus on identity, from interacting with AI agents to new demands for authentication or proof of personhood. So far, though, we've left out what may create the strongest impulse for change: the things people *must* do - the sharp pain points - that require digital identity. As you go down this rabbit hole, government tends to be at the center of these problems.

To state the obvious, governments are critical in identity both because they are the issuer of some of our most important credentials - the ones that let us access healthcare, open bank accounts, travel, drive, buy alcohol, start a business, get married, and more - and because they are the provider of (or payer for) many of the most vital services we need. So, while our first instinct is often to be wary of entrepreneurial opportunities dependent on government changes or actions, there are good reasons to view government differently in the identity space.

The first is that governments play a central role in digitizing key identity credentials. We can see in countries like India, Estonia, and Brazil that well-executed, government-backed digital identity systems can have dramatic, positive effects on both the public and private sector. Aadhaar authentication transactions in India have surged to over 2 billion a month, the majority carried out with biometric fingerprints (with rising use of facial authentication); the cumulative number of Aadhaar e-KYC transactions is now over 15 billion. While other markets are still well behind in implementation - for example, only 15% of public service providers in EU countries allow cross-border authentication with eID - there is steady progress. The U.S. mobile driver's license (mDL) initiative, for example, has seen adoption from a range of states (AZ, CT, GA, IA) since the publishing of a new ISO standard in 2021; consumers now have a straightforward process (biometrics + picture) to add digital IDs to Apple or Android wallets. Over time, these types of verified credentials will be issued at the point of disbursement. With some luck, we might even get a shot at skipping the line at the DMV.

While we would be thrilled for digital credentials to quickly supersede other forms of identity, we already see - even in advanced markets - the complexity of execution. Like in payments, where the

# 216.246.100.123

world is at 800+ alternative payment methods and counting, we expect emerging identity systems to supplement more than they displace. This diversity creates opportunity for identity processors that can help businesses and developers adopt new solutions (e.g. mDLs or eIDs) while still handling the breadth of what exists. Like for payment "enablers" (a term you've heard from us in the past), winning identity processors can accrue value both by growing with new digital business models and by simplifying jobs that are more and more difficult to keep in-house (as hard cases, edge cases, and fraud grow). Change is the friend of these types of businesses; if government-led digital identities blossom as they have in India, it should be a boon for nimble identity processors. Financial wallets might also find that digital IDs can help acquire or engage users; Apple's efforts to help people drive or go to a bar without a physical license is an obvious but good example of this.

The second area of opportunity we see arises from our expectation that governments will at times outsource the issuance of credentials needed to access valuable public spaces and services. Some governments will work to employ new digital identity systems entirely themselves, especially when the political and economic dynamics align (as has been the case with Aadhaar in India). In other instances, the political will or economic coordination needed to implement new digital identities might not be readily available. In these cases, we expect to see government agencies empower others to meet pressing identity problems.

Two compelling examples today are CLEAR and ID.me, both private sector businesses that have been able to solve problems for government agencies while attracting valuable customer bases. By addressing acute pain points – for consumers, being stuck in long security lines and, for the U.S. TSA, unclogging jammed airport checkpoints – CLEAR has acquired more than 17M paying users and been able to expand its services beyond airports, including into financial KYC. Similarly, ID.me, which works with over 31 states and multiple federal agencies on verification and authentication for key government services such as tax, has now reached over 100M members. While the start-up costs and risks associated with selling to government is high, the juice can be worth the squeeze; ID.me and CLEAR have been able to develop valuable identity wallets and networks, gather highly sensitive identity data, build recognizable brands - and get paid well to do all of it (e.g. ID.me landing an $86M IRS contract in 2021). Further, given low consumer expectations, these companies have been able to (in fact, have been expected to) put quite a bit of friction around verification and authentication while still being viewed as an upgrade. Yoti offers another compelling case study; by enabling a range of government-aided use cases of growing relevance - for example, digital age verification and estimation – Yoti has amassed 12M+ downloads and now serves some of the biggest companies in the world.

Figuring out how to align with the priorities and timelines of government agencies is not for every entrepreneur or operator. But given the need for coordination and political consensus – and the

tension around efficiency versus privacy that will long persist in discussions of government-affiliated identity systems - the private sector has a role to play. For companies that build trust and play their cards right, we suspect the rewards could be significant.

## Don't count out crypto – it may just be the best infrastructure for the future of digital identity

Across this letter, we have returned multiple times to the possibilities of a world with greater user control over identity - a world where you can bring personal context with you across the digital and physical world, easily authenticate, and manage credentials in a privacy-preserving manner. A lot of entrepreneurs, organizations, and governments share this dream. The acronyms drizzled across the space (ESSIF! MOSIP! FIDO! W3C! UIDAI!) are evidence of their efforts - and a testament to how defining the future of identity is as much about coordination as technology. Even if we have the right design, how do we convince everyone - including governments and companies with vested interests – to change? How long will it take?

At a moment when referencing crypto in a positive light can get you kicked out of a dinner party, it's easy to overlook that we already have the foundations of an open, user-controlled identity system, available to any person or entity on the planet. Speculation and early use cases have driven hundreds of millions of users, tens of thousands of active researchers and developers, and billions of dollars of investment into crypto. The result has been a steady march toward robust infrastructure – infrastructure that is, in many respects, ideal for the identity system of the future: built around strong key management, enabled by interoperable messaging and wallet standards, and quickly pushing out the frontiers of digital privacy (with, for example, the embrace of zero-knowledge proofs). And, without any explicit coordination needed, crypto wallet infrastructure is compatible not only with crypto standards, but also with W3C standards that power the web.

Fine, we'll just come out and say it: we think crypto infrastructure will play a central role in how we capture, store, and share identity information across commerce, financial services, and more. Of course, we aren't there yet; amongst other issues, the press is still rife with stories about lost keys or coins disappearing without recourse, and crypto wallets are still challenging to use, built mostly as browser extensions, reliant on seed phrases for security, and full of inscrutable jargon and transaction behaviors. But pointing out today's limitations misses the point: crypto wallets and identity infrastructure are getting better at a very fast rate - much (much) faster than other digital identity systems.

Consider that in the two-year period it has taken nine U.S. states to announce support for mobile driver's licenses, the crypto ecosystem has launched, tested, and iterated on a range of fundamental technologies (e.g. MPC-based approaches to key management, account abstraction, smart contract wallets) that make crypto wallets easier, safer, and more private. Additionally, developers have experimented with an array of approaches to identity infrastructure on blockchains, from employing NFT-based credentials, to embedding wallets in apps, to using public keys as DIDs in a variety of configurations. When we step back, we see a good chance that central identity problems - for example, "how can I provide KYC-level information (e.g. proof of address, age verification), re-use it with multiple parties, and comply with regulation - and do it all without divulging the underlying data (e.g. home address or birthdate)" - are more likely to be solved first in crypto.

Crypto apps and communities are proving to be identity playgrounds. Here is just a handful of examples of the energy and scope of identity exploration in crypto:

*   **Token-Gated Communities:** NFTs or other tokens provide access exclusive benefits, privileges, content, or communities. Example: Spotify testing "token-enabled playlists" that let holders of specific NFTs access curated music.

Confidential

# 216.246.100.123

*   **Profile Pictures (or PFPs):** NFTs that allow people to showcase their interests, allegiances, or status, akin to using social clubs, cars, or art as part of your identity. Example: the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), a collection of 10K NFTs that has traded over $2B of value and attracted celebrities including Madonna, Snoop Dogg, and Justin Timberlake.
*   **Decentralized DNS:** decentralized identifiers (pointing to one or more wallets, similar to how DNS works for web addresses) that may function like an email or social handle and enable messaging across blockchains with easily shareable names. Example: Ethereum Name Service (ENS), which has 500K+ active names and 765,000+ unique participants.
*   **Proof of provenance:** signing media with crypto wallets as a means of proving authenticity and creatorship. Example: writers using Mirror.xyz, a web3 publishing platform, to sign posts with their Ethereum wallets.
*   **Identity as an asset:** tokenizing access to individuals or their content as a way of monetizing identity. Example: Friend.tech, which gained 100K+ users in 10 days and $18M in fees in its first two months by enabling the creation and trading of tokens representing specific users.
*   **Biometric-based decentralized identity:** issuing identities on a blockchain with biometric verification. Example: Worldcoin has attracted over 2.8 million people across 120 countries, all of whom have used a Worldcoin Orb to sign up by scanning their irises.

While these use cases may inspire anything from "that makes sense" to "wtf?" depending on your point of view, they all help advance what is possible on blockchain-based infrastructure. How will this infrastructure gain broader adoption? If history is any guide, the answer is likely to be weirder than we imagine, but that won't stop us from guessing. One avenue is through businesses trying to know their customers better. We have talked with several large enterprises - some overseeing multiple products or companies – that want to build cross-platform loyalty products. Imagine a media company looking for a way to develop customer touch points across multiple properties (e.g. subscription TV service, amusement parks, gaming franchise). The company could spend tens of millions of dollars building something bespoke... or they could just leverage free, open-source crypto infrastructure, which would then be interoperable both internally and externally. This idea is broadly extensible – for example, to any company looking for creative ways to connect with customers, or any investment issuer wanting a simple way to communicate with holders.

As different types of corporates find value in crypto infrastructure, we may end up with wallets embedded inside applications all over the world, in ways that are mostly invisible to users. We are in the early innings but can see this future approaching: Telegram has been rolling out a wallet to 800M+ users; Shopify plans to embed wallets for their 70M+ SHOP app users; Nucoin now counts 14M of their 85M Nubank users as wallet holders; Grab is testing a wallet across 35M users; TravelX has issued over 4M wallets to passengers of just one airline. While these companies have different use cases to start, the technology is the same. Infrastructure leaders like Fireblocks and Crossmint are enabling brands to quickly embed wallets, including use cases around loyalty or payments; on top of custody, they are also quickly expanding what is possible in interacting with blockchains – tokenizing novel assets, working to power on-chain compliance (e.g. KYC), and more. As more wallets and user accounts become compatible with crypto infrastructure (and therefore able to share context with each other), the lines may start to blur; now, the media conglomerate might find that building identity with open-source infrastructure is not only easier but can enable a more feature-rich and connected experience.

It is also possible that identity built on crypto spreads in more explicit ways. The stablecoin market offers an interesting case study; while bank-backed stablecoins like USDC are, in one sense, just tokens representing dollars at a regulated financial institution, they are also highly innovative, able to travel around the world, 24x7x365, in any amount, in seconds if not milliseconds. A tokenized KYC credential, issued by a credible enough institution, could have some of the same magic.

In the end, crypto infrastructure may find a pivotal role in the future of identity for any number of reasons - crypto applications grow quickly, crypto wallets become embedded broadly, a mix of both, or (most likely) something we can't see quite yet. Our take is don't count out crypto!

## The biggest identity opportunity over the next decade is likely in B2B networks

We've been spilling a lot of ink on the need to upgrade our identity systems, but it's worth a moment of appreciation for what we have. If you rewind 60+ years, the most prevalent form of consumer credit was store credit. At that time, the owner of the local hardware store had to know not only about hammers and hardwoods, but about when to say yes if a customer asked to pay next week. A customer might be juggling tabs across merchants – an inconvenience for the customer, a danger for the merchants - and merchants had to maintain their own credit ledgers, administer loyalty programs, and handle collections. Relying on context from personal and local knowledge for underwriting work alright in small circles but left a lot of business on the table.

Today, thanks to modern payment and identity systems, hardware store owners don't need to be bankers anymore. By facilitating one-to-many credentialing – enabling issuing banks to attest to and take the risk on customers' creditworthiness at any merchant - the card networks have dramatically grown the pie. In addition to an identity apparatus that facilitates real-time authentications and authorizations, the card systems benefit from formal credit reporting on over 230M Americans and over 2B people worldwide. While today's credit identity platforms are far from perfect – roughly half of all CFPB complaints concern the credit bureaus - they underpin over $4.5T of credit card payment volume across over 1B cards in the U.S. alone.

B2B commerce is a different story. In most spaces where we invest, it is common to see B2B solutions 10-15 years behind consumer. In identity, this is easily true. B2B companies, in many respects, still manage the way store clerks did half a century ago: operating on trust, assessing creditworthiness deal by deal, trying to win business while simultaneously deciding whether they want the business. By most estimates we've seen, at least 85% of B2B transactions are peer-to-peer. These deals can be high stakes with bidirectional risk; buyers need to select suppliers before knowing if they will deliver, and

sellers make investments before knowing if buyers will pay. The most common identity "solutions" businesses end up using are rules of thumb and past experience.

Businesses that do look for more sophisticated B2B identity solutions find limitations. While there are plenty of B2B data providers and bureaus, the data is less regulated, less uniform, and less complete than for consumers. This is partially the maturity of the B2B identity space, but also just the nature of the problem. Businesses are more heterogenous than people - varying widely by size, type, industry - and more complex. Their key identity attributes, including their finances, tend to change more dynamically and unpredictably. While businesses, unlike consumers, spend a lot of time and money organizing their identity information (e.g. audits, required reporting), historically this information has rarely been standardized or real-time, has lived across disparate and siloed systems, and has been challenging to share without divulging sensitive information.

These gaps in B2B identity create enormous costs and inefficiencies. B2B businesses typically bear the identity-related costs of transacting (e.g. compliance, underwriting, reconciliation, reporting, and tax), often building duplicative, non-core capabilities. Without networks for credit identity, good actors are often not rewarded, bad actors are often not punished, and businesses struggle to know if they are acquiring creditworthy customers, especially in a digital world. The symptoms are apparent across B2B: the average invoice costs over $10 to process, over 40% of B2B payments in the U.S. are still made with checks, and invoice fraud is a rapidly growing problem. A report put out by Tally Street, a financial analytics firm, found that well over half of SMB B2B sales are collected late, and over two-thirds of companies that received 50%+ late payments suffer cash flow problems. And that is measuring what does happen – it is impossible to know the opportunity cost of forgone business because of lack of trust, friction in onboarding, and poor access to credit.

The current state of B2B identity belies the potential value in getting it right. The KYB market alone is estimated at $12B, today's B2B credit reporting market at another $8B. The broader markets around organizing B2B identity information are much bigger - global accounting and auditing at around $220B, ERP software market at around $54B, and the global data analytics market at roughly $50B. While the future of B2B identity may borrow from or build on the enterprise value in each of these segments, to us a better way of thinking about the opportunity is to compare B2C and B2B commerce. Today, roughly 18% of B2C commerce happens online, thanks in large part to functioning payment and identity systems underneath them. B2B commerce – which is in the $120T+ range and anywhere from 3-5x as large as B2C, depending on which source you use – is only 5.5% online. Viewed through this lens, getting B2B commerce to par by making it as efficient and context rich as B2C has the potential to unlock $20T+ of digital transactions.

While we are not the first to take note of the opportunity in B2B identity, there is good reason to think the timing might be right. B2B identity data is much more structured and available in an age of APIs and SaaS. Ten years ago, the closest thing to a data wallet at most businesses would have been Quickbooks desktop or an inscrutable, on-premises ERP. Today, SaaS spending is over $200B, nearly 20x the size of the market when we started Ribbit; over 70% of software used by businesses are SaaS, and 78% of organizations are storing sensitive data in the cloud. This is the same fundamental trend we've written and discussed with you over the past couple of years around B2B finance; as businesses move their operations and finance into the cloud, that is where the context about them lives. Against this backdrop, a few B2B identity opportunities are top of mind:

*   In addition to B2B identity processing being messier and more nuanced than consumer, the space is also more greenfield. While a handful of leading B2C digital onboarding platforms started in the past several years are now upwards of $50M in ARR and growing quickly, the B2B space is still just forming. And the pain is substantial; for example, the average bank onboarding for a corporate client takes over 4x as long as for a consumer. As B2B commerce and embedded finance grow, we see considerable opportunity for companies like Middesk or Coris that help with KYB, underwriting, and risk management, for companies like Rutter that make B2B identity data accessible across scores of software platforms, and for companies like Stedi that modernize the intricate, invaluable work of forging connections between B2B systems. And we believe there is enormous potential in processors like Duna with the ambition to create reusable identity wallets in B2B, where the idea is likely even more powerful than in consumer.
*   Business identity may turn out to be a richer canvas for AI than consumer. When we talk to portfolio companies about business onboarding, the response is overwhelmingly how hard and manual it still is to collect, organize, and analyze data - all tasks where AI has the potential to be game-changing. And just as we see AI as an impetus for consumer data backpacks, we know the desire to use AI for all kinds of operations (e.g. BI, spend management, AP/AR reconciliation, financial forecasting) will motivate businesses to make similar additions or upgrades to their data infrastructure. Expect to hear a lot more about this point from us in the next few years.
*   Compared with consumer, B2B identity data is naturally more disparate. While a small set of companies control huge amounts of consumer data (e.g. FAANG, credit bureaus), even the biggest B2B data banks are small. QuickBooks's 5M+ subscribers, for instance, represents less than 3% of global SMBs, and leading financial SaaS platforms like Bill.com and Coupa have low single-digit penetration in the US. Additionally, B2B identity data should often be more directly monetizable; if Zack's ice cream business completes an audit, turns profitable, or pays off a loan, Zack may be motivated and willing to pay to share attestations to these facts, especially if he can do so in a way that is privacy-preserving. When we put these two thoughts together, one conclusion is that decentralized identity may find more natural adoption points in B2B.

Business identity is a truly enormous topic, and we are just touching on the very tip of the iceberg of how businesses will unlock the context needed for better money. Many of the opportunities discussed in this letter - the shift to perpetual KYC, the opportunity for open networks in credential issuance – are likely bigger in B2B than in B2C. We could write an entire letter about it, and then some... let us know if you want more of this section, and we just might!

## Being an identity issuer may turn out to be a lucrative business in the future

If you ask any financial services executive today about identity, you are likely to be met with a groan. Despite spending a small fortune on identity challenges – over $500M at the biggest banks on KYC, CDD, and onboarding alone - the results leave plenty to be desired (for one, 980 financial data

# 216.246.100.123

breaches from 2018-2022 in just the US). So, it is not shocking that the word identity makes bankers see red.

Over the last 25 years, there has been a seemingly evergreen opportunity to sell software on the promise of helping with this morass. Some of the opportunities we've already covered – for example, building identity processing platforms that use AI to fight AI – are likely to build a lot of value doing just that. But while helping banks save money or respond to the latest compliance or fraud fire is a tried-and-true strategy, we believe there may be an even bigger opportunity in the years ahead – flipping identity from a cost problem to a profit center.

The core of this idea comes from a belief in the untapped opportunity that better identity systems hold to increase personalization and conversion across financial services. In a world with reusable identity, we imagine a set of incentives where identity issuers could be compensated for doing the work of identity, akin to how large parts of payments work now. In card networks, for example, the lions' share of the economics go to card issuers for good reason – issuers bear the responsibility of acquiring customers, managing relationships, and absorbing both credit and fraud risk. As companies do the heavy lifting involved in verifying and re-verifying identity information - in effect, issuing an internal credential for that customer - there is an opportunity for them to share that credential externally (with user permission) for a fee. While regulation, particularly in financial services, needs to evolve significantly to support this kind of reusability, the model stands to make money for the issuer, dramatically improve conversion for other processors, and make customers' lives easier.

Consider, for example, the potential for a trusted bank (say, JP Morgan) to issue a credential to every customer that they KYC - and then to be paid by other financial services providers to verify that credential later. In this case, JP Morgan would be leveraging both their extensive operational and technological investment in KYC as well as their trusted brand. Other banks, fintech companies, and telcos, for example, could streamline costs and onboard customers much more efficiently; odds are, JP Morgan was doing a much better job of KYC than they were. For the issuer, this business, like payments, is likely to have a meaningful margin; a KYC credential issued by JPM would be more valuable to all parties involved than one issued by an unlicensed offshore crypto exchange.

One reason that we suspect this will happen more in the future is that we already see examples of it. First, in the analog world, banks today are issuing types of verified credentials in physical format through certification stamps (e.g. certifying an identity document or even issuing bank bills as identifying documents). Second, in the digital world, we see something similar emerging with open banking around the world. After initially fighting over data access, banks are largely ceding the point that consumers own their personal data – and then arguing that banks should be compensated for ensuring its security and providing access to third parties. Over time, we suspect that financial institutions will find themselves becoming both data providers and data recipients, with both pieces critical to their bottom line and their broader efforts to stay compliant and serve customers well.

Another reason is that there are already several businesses and industries that monetize primarily as issuers of credentials, from auditors to universities. While we tend to think about these organizations as having a critical job ancillary to the credential, the credential holds the most tangible value for the recipient. Similarly, many software companies create credentialing regimes for loyal experts and service providers. Insurance companies already do this with Certificates of Insurance (COIs); with their archaic systems, most insurers spend an untold amount and customer goodwill on trying to produce COIs reliably. As the infrastructure for managing identity - and the opportunity to share or attest to information in privacy-preserving ways – becomes more accessible, how many businesses might find ways to incorporate identity issuing into their business? For example, payment companies like Stripe, Adyen, or Razorpay could start to issue credentials that allowed businesses to attest to having a certain level of revenue, diversity of customer base, or some other important financial metric

– all without having to divulge the underlying information. The ability to use zero-knowledge proofs or fully homomorphic encryption to overcome today's tradeoffs (between proving credibility and preserving confidentiality) may open an enormous opportunity for tech-savvy issuers.

One parting thought: creating global card networks has led to an issuance industry that generates over $185B in annual revenue and has helped spur GDP growth for decades. When you consider the fact that 67% of corporate treasurers report limiting the number of banks they work with because of KYC-related challenges, or that over 50% of bank customers abandon processes that take over 10 minutes, how much value could be created - and, in turn, captured by issuers - when identity is put on rails?

## To Sum It All Up

Over the years, we have often heard David Velez, the founder of Nubank, talk about how the company's true mission is not specific to credit or banking or even financial services, but rather "empowering people by fighting complexity." While it may be hard after 20+ pages of text and data to convince you we also want to avoid complexity, David's articulation of Nubank's mission has always really resonated with us. And it captures well why we are so drawn to this topic. Identity lies at the core of so many of the pain points we all feel in accessing, moving, borrowing, saving, and investing money.

When we think about how to improve financial services in the next decade - how to remove complexity while giving consumers and businesses access to better money – we know it is only possible if we figure out how to empower intelligent software, running on modern, open financial infrastructure, to operate with context.

The status quo will not get us there. We feel that truth most deeply when we ask ourselves some basic questions about what the next decade holds:

*   In 2034, will we all still be juggling hundreds of usernames and passwords?
*   In 2034, will compliance in financial services still rely heavily on analog credentials?
*   In 2034, will government-supported systems like Aadhaar be the only breakout platforms powering the future of identity?
*   In 2034, will Apple, Google, Meta, Amazon, and a small number of other giants own our identity data and the value associated with it?
*   By 2034, will AI fundamentally change our identity systems – and how we even think about identity as a topic - in ways that we don't yet comprehend?

For us, the answers, at least at a high-level, are clear. As money and data become more deeply connected and intertwined, we will see a dramatic leap forward in what financial services can do for consumers and business owners around the world. And while we don't know exactly what it will look like, you should expect us to work tirelessly to figure it out – and, as always, to scour the earth for the visionary entrepreneurs who will eventually show us the way. If you happen to meet any, you know where to find us!
