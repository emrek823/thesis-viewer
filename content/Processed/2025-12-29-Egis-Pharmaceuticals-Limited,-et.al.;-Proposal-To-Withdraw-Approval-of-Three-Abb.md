## Abstract
The Food and Drug Administration's (FDA or Agency) Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) is proposing to withdraw approval of three abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs) and is announcing an opportunity for the ANDA holders to request a hearing on this proposal. The basis for the proposal is that these ANDA holders have repeatedly failed to file required annual reports for those ANDAs.
