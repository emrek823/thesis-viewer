### Current Focus and Strategic Direction

- My focus is on a lot of the things we’ve been discussing:
	- Solidifying and making decisions about the early team
	- Go-to-market strategy - everyone is aligned on the payer side with AI that’s up for grabs; I’m very bearish on incumbents
		- The way I’m doing that is talking to subject matter experts
- I am so confident on the tech build side that I’m almost 80-100% focused on the go-to-market
	- I have a lot of confidence and conviction on the tech side

### Strategic Evolution and Pivot Points

- How has your thinking evolved?
	- September 15th as deadline to found
	- Before that, I had started with a pretty different spot - started with self-funded market
		- Part of it was state of tech on that side was even worse than traditional payer
		- Also part of starting there - part of me was thinking Oscar would externalize a lot of what I was thinking about
- Self-funded market challenges:
	- The margins are razor thin
	- The data is super fragmented
	- Not one clear place to put data on top of it
	- The markets are shifting a little bit - your employer is going to be the one to decide what employer is moving away from that
	- Make it very clear that they are going to pay out of pocket and bypass traditional means of healthcare access
- I won’t just supply the technology and I’ll be a TPA pivot:
	- To run a TPA, some other business ideas were more like services businesses first, and technology second
	- My bread and butter is running tech business
	- If my goal is meaningfully bend the cost curve, I’ll be a lot more impactful to be infrastructure supplier
- There is an inflection point now where providers + payers - patients and members are feeling the friction so they are willing to spend out of pocket
	- I don’t think providers are trying to bill as much as they can and payers are denying as much as they can
	- How can you design a business to enable them to do what they’re supposed to do?
	- Payers are equally burdened with tech and operations that don’t make any sense
- Instead of the world we have today:
	- For managing high-cost claimants, let’s build the technology in service of first principles
	- I see it as the same end goal - lots of people focused on same problem, just different paths

### Go-to-Market Wedges and Product Strategy

- Wedges/GTM strategy:
	- Pre-pay chart review - payers would like to do more pre-pay chart review but can’t today because it’s extremely manual and cumbersome
		- Getting the charts from the provider faster and offering it cheaper and doing the review faster
		- You can move that further upstream
		- For the member, it’s better - worst thing is you pay a claim and then realize it was wrong after the fact
	- Prior auth - the angle I’m taking is not just “should this be approved”
		- If I get the medical record before the procedure has happened, I know so much more about what patient’s future medical needs will be
		- I’m going to approve this request and do member outreach and get ahead of 10 steps that will follow
		- I’m going to deny this request - why don’t you get this at an imaging center instead and we’ll approve it
	- High dollar claim review - spans across departments at payer organizations today
		- Your high cost claimants are the ones with most urgent healthcare needs
		- You lose context when you pass between departments
		- Most expensive people at payer organization have to do it (like chief actuary at Oscar)
- Very confident in the tech build side and building the right team from the Oscar portfolio
- The only other thing to spend time on is understanding HealthEdge or Cognizant code base better
	- Thesis that this business is built around is that these systems are antiquated
	- You can go to a payer and say we’re not going to rip and replace your claims engine
	- Assuming payers won’t rip and replace, need to walk in with more confidence on intelligence layer compatibility

### Market Validation and Timeline

- Connection between financial system at the payer organization and the outreach to members:
	- Most people that work in healthcare get excited about this
	- Payers are not excited about just denying claims
- Conversations with industry experts have actually surprised me - how much Oscar has done has been transferrable
	- 100% of my time talking to industry experts
	- If my learnings from Oscar don’t translate, the entire business gets put at risk
	- High dollar claim review - really annoying thing that saved the company millions of dollars every single month
	- Looking at claims and doing very basic sanity checks
- October 15th timeline:
	- I feel confident with this menu of options
	- Testing in more of a sales capacity rather than discovery capacity
	- The deadline I had given myself to zoom in on what neighborhood of business to build
	- That was supposed to be self-funded vs. TPA vs. payer
	- By October 15th: who is this for (payers), what is it (shadow adjudication system), and initial thoughts on the roadmap

### Team and Business Model Considerations

- Co-founder - it will be someone I’ve been friends with for a while that I’ve been work trialing
	- He would come in as technical person/CTO
	- He just exited his company, giving him time to take a breath
- The most important question I want to answer right now:
	- Version 1 of business - I say I’m going to replace Cognizant - that is the root of evil for payers, let’s go up against that. You deserve a lot better
	- Version 2 of business - do this wedge in with 1 thing and build up from there, tentacle your way into organization
	- Version 3 - intelligence platform to sit on top
- What is the risk tolerance and frustration for payers with the first approach?
	- Looking for 1 design partner - for 1% of claims (inpatient claims at this 1 facility)
	- If you’re going to take a swing, take a big swing
	- Don’t want to be another point solution that’s just zero sum and adding cost to the system
