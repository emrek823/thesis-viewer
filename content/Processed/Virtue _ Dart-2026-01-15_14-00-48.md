### Team Scaling & Hiring Strategy

- Major lesson: Everything was founder-dependent, extremely frustrating
- Key hires in progress:
- Kelly (post-acute sales) completing 4th week
	- Independent on post-acute side
	- Strong impact already visible
	- Hospital hire will come earlier in process based on Kelly’s success
- End-of-year target: 15-18 people total
	- Engineering: 2-3 additional under head (currently 5)
	- Success: 4-6 delivery people
	- Sales: ~4 people total
- Jackson (delivery hire) finishing month 2, performing well
- Working with Equitas for sales recruiting

### Product & Technical Progress

- Core early bets paying off, ditched “cool but useless” features
- Fine-tuning/training deemed waste of time for their use cases
- Major focus on context graphs and real-time workflow data collection
- Models (Opus 5.2) now enable long-running tasks vs previous deterministic stitching
- Key improvements:
	- Deployment times down 50%
	- 100k+ reviews/week processing
	- 6x faster processing times
	- Inference costs down, reinvested in better quality/speed
- Competitive positioning vs Palantir/Overseer: focus on post-decision human feedback loops
- Three core areas maintained: People + LLMs, production evals, adaptable patient management

### Go-to-Market & Sales Approach

- Post-acute success translating to hospital market
- 50-80% same language/approach between markets
- Target: Quality/care coordination teams (between business ops and clinical)
- Hospital pitch focuses on:
	- Data analyst tool for quality departments (clinical + technical skills gap)
	- Chart review and sample case analysis
- St. Luke’s triaging use case now viable (previously impossible)
- Positioning advantage: 3-week $150k deployments vs 6-month $1M+ competitors
- Best hospital prospects:
	- Multiple quality leadership layers (chief quality → system VP → associate VP)
	- Systems without dedicated quality departments (COO/CCO handling)
	- Value-based care contracts

### Next Steps

- Veeraj/Aakruti: Send recruiter profiles to Virtue in 2 weeks
- Sean/Emre: In-person meeting Jan 29-30 if available
- Dart: Updated one-pager/sales materials reflecting positioning shifts
- Dart: Pipeline update for next call
- Dart: Commercial tactics for end-of-year goals discussion
- Tampa General LP event in February - health systems attendance opportunity
