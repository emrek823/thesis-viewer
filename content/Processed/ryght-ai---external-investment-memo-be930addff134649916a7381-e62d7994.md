## Executive Summary
Ryght AI is building a biopharma data and analytics platform for R&D and commercial applications ($40B market) by leveraging data partnerships, modern technology infrastructure, and open-source LLMs to provide business users with real-time access to analytics in a natural language interface.

Ryght has assembled a team of biopharma industry veterans with ML/AI + healthcare experience led by Simon Arkell, a proven serial entrepreneur who has previously raised $100M across three (3) prior companies all of which have been acquired. We would back this team addressing this specific market opportunity independent of recent advances in LLMs.

Ryght Al - External Investment Memo 2

The Ryght platform can reduce the barrier to anyone in biopharma, irrespective of their analytics prowess, to use data to ask sophisticated questions (e.g., "Which providers treat the most patients with lung cancer?"). Biopharma is fully aware of the potential of this data, but internal data science teams are bespoke, slow, and expensive. Analytics vendors in the space (e.g., Clarify, Komodo) are also struggling to keep up with the increasing number of data workflows customers are asking for because of their inflexible technology platforms.

Ryght is building a micro-services architecture and real-time ingestion platform on the backend that alone is differentiated from current solutions in market today. Advances in LLMs provide additional opportunity to build a natural language interface for business users and improve the speed, cost, and performance of data engineering under the hood. Hc1, Ryght's first data partner, gives the company data and distribution advantages from day one with access to 220M patient profiles (labs, claims, EMR) for training and real-time access to 500M monthly lab results. Ryght's goal is to become the Force.com for LLMs in biopharma - providing a flexible platform to serve data partners and biopharma customers directly to train, tune, store, and/or perform inference with valuable datasets.

Virtue is leading a $3M SAFE at a $15M post-money cap with $975K (6.5% ownership) to support Ryght in the launch of the Hc1 application, the first direct to biopharma application, and demonstrate the ability to accumulate and retain training residuals from multiple data sources and resulting improved inference capability.

Ryght Al - External Investment Memo 3

Core Ryght team members include:

*   **Simon Arkell, CEO**. Simon has raised $100M across three (3) prior startups he founded where each was subsequently acquired. Simon's most recent company, Deep Lens, a digital pathology workflow platform, was acquired by Paradigm (seeded with $200M from General Catalyst & Arch Venture Partners). It was made apparent in our diligence that Paradigm used as a significant amount of their equity (all-cash acquisition) to acquire Deep Lens in order to accelerate their product development and overall roadmap. Simon is a proven entrepreneur with deep biopharma domain expertise and track record in building AI/ML-native products.
*   **Alex Dickinson, Executive Chair**. Alex is a recognized executive within the biopharma industry having founded Chromacode (molecular diagnostics; raised $94M+ from firms such as NEA, Maverick, Northpond, etc.), Helixis (molecular diagnostics; sold to Illumina for $105M), and Luxtera (sold for $660M+; raised $130M+ from firms such as NEA, Lux Capital, August Capital and others). While Alex's title is ‘Executive Chair’ he will be taking a day-to-day operational role during the seed stage where he is focused on strategy and business development efforts.
*   **John Crupi, CTO**. John oversees all technical product development and importantly has worked closely with Simon prior (Predixion). John has been a CTO across multiple organizations for 2 decades during which his predominant focus has been on developing enterprise systems architecture and artificial intelligence (AI) native products.
*   **Other: Brad Bostic, Alexi Polenur, Tyrone Richardson**. We are reticent to overlook other core team members given their impressive track records and strong off-sheet references. Each has prior experience working together and/or is recognized as leaders within their respective specialties across biopharma and healthcare data sectors.
*   **Potential Additions**. It is expected that several high caliber individuals with established pedigree and industry recognized reputations may join Ryght within 12-18 months post-seed investment. This can be attributed to the existing core management team, whose credibility and proven abilities, earned themselves the unique ability to attract these individuals to an early stage startup. Individuals such as [CONFIDENTIAL - SVP, Global Head of Data

Ryght Al - External Investment Memo 4

Science & AI at Global Top 25 Biopharma] are currently engaged and could join Ryght within the next 12-18 months.

In today's market environment where macro conditions and the overall economic outlook remains murky, at best, we place an even greater emphasis on seasoned teams who possess uniquely valuable competitive advantages that will be required to attract the “3 Cs” - capital, customers, and community (team members). Through our direct interactions with Ryght management as well as our on- and off-sheet management references we have quickly gained a high degree of confidence that Simon and the team will be able to successfully navigate Ryght during the formative 0 → 1 stage amidst an uncertain economic (+ fundraising) climate.

## Market History: Evolution of the Biopharma Data Ecosystem
The evolution of the biopharma data ecosystem highlights the complex and inefficient process today of getting from data to insights, and highlights the need for Ryght's platform.

**Claims Data Provides Longitudinal View But Has Gaps**: Historically, claims data has been the main data type for healthcare and pharmaceutical research. There are 2 broad distinctions in claims databases. Some data aggregators (IQVIA, Symphony Health) aggregate data from many different claims clearinghouses and provider billing systems that cover more patient lives but may not have 100% claims capture for each patient. Others (IBM MarketScan, Optum Insights, Blue Health Intelligence, Inovalon Insights) have data from health plans or self-insured employer groups that tend to cover fewer patient lives, but will have 100% claims capture for each patient.

Despite the widespread utilization of claims data, there are many instances and use cases where claims data is missing information (new patient starts are mislabeled due to lack of claims lookback), has the wrong information (claim carries the wrong diagnosis code), or is simply not collected in claims data (metastatic status or line of therapy). Analytics companies (e.g., Clarify, and Komodo) have gained traction over the last 5 years to address some of these issues. These companies buy/license data from a variety of different sources - Inovalon (Medical and Rx claims), Clarivate (Clearinghouse Medical and Rx Claims), Office Ally (Clearinghouse Medical Claims), Agilum (837 claims from

Ryght Al - External Investment Memo 5

provider), Express Scripts (PBM-sourced claims), CMS (qualified entity program) - and aggregate, normalize, and clean data for use by pharma. Even these companies are struggling to re-engineer their technology architecture to adapt to the changing needs of customers.

**EMR Has Deeper Clinical View But Data Is Hard To Access**: In certain situations, claims data may be an imperfect reflection of the actual status of a patient and EMR data is necessary. One study found that only 30% of CKD patients would have been found with claims data alone because the claim was missing eGFR lab results pulled from the EMR. Historically, EMR data was often limited to a single research institution or provider network. Obtaining the data needed to help answer a specific research question usually involved a tedious and inefficient process. Recent examples (e.g., Flatiron's $2B acquisition by Roche), have shown the value of highly curated EMR datasets. Today, there are ~20 specialty EHR data partners selling data to biopharma across oncology, rheumatology, mental health, women's health, and dermatology.

Despite the demonstrated value of EMR data, the process to collect this unstructured data (80% of data) is still massively inefficient. Flatiron, for example, employs 500+ oncology nurses to abstract data from its OncoEMR and is still utilizing its homegrown ETL tool built in 2012. The 21st Century Cures Act is a step in the right direction, but FHIR is only yet another standard that provides a data model for describing data, a RESTful API, and a set of open-source tools. The actual data elements that are required to be made available - known as United States Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) - are extremely limited. It is easiest to imagine USCDI as the basic information you would get an annual check-up (height, weight, allergies, etc), a level of data that is not sufficient for pharmaceutical applications.

**Linked Data Assets are Starting to Emerge**: In response to these challenges, biopharma has been looking to link different datasets (internal and external sources) to drive insights. The rise of Datavant's data ecosystem is one of the best examples of this trend. Datavant is a data marketplace that de-identifies patient data using a tokenization technique (e.g., John Smith = AA001). Datavant's data ecosystem (shown below) has >300M covered lives and access to >20B patient records. Datavant's recent merger with Ciox (focused on identified patient records through chart pulls) created a $7B entity that has strong inroads with >80% of top 20 biopharma.

Ryght Al - External Investment Memo 6

Similarly, Ryght will look to work with partners with a variety of different datasets, starting with labs/dx and moving into genomics, claims, EHR, and more.

## Datavant Data Ecosystem

**Totaling:**
*   > 300 million covered lives
*   > 20 billion patient records

**Data Types connected by DATAVANT to enable a holistic view of the patient:**
*   **Claims**: >80% of U.S. medical claims
*   **EMR**: 6 major systems for ambulatory care
*   **Lab**: Major diagnostic labs, plus specialty & genetic labs

## TAM: $40B+ Pharma Data and Analytics Market
Ryght is initially focused on biopharma sales and marketing because of large, defined budgets ($50B for services and technology) and quicker timeline to ROI vs. R&D, but can expand across the $40B pharma data and analytics market over time.

**$50B+ in Annual Global Pharma Promotion Spend (Services + Analytics)**: In 2021, biopharma companies invested nearly $51B globally across sales force and marketing channel performance (+9.2% vs. 2020).

Ryght will be targeting similar budgets as companies in the buckets above, not offering similar solutions. Biopharma is facing pricing pressures and heightened competitive dynamics, which is driving them to reduce fixed costs and shift to more flexible cost structures for S&M. There is also an increasing focus on simplifying historically complex supply chains and streamlining vendor management, with more value being placed on quality of the product and reliability of timely delivery. This gives rise to increased automation, consolidating vendors, and new technology such as cloud-based applications, a meaningful opportunity for technology and analytics companies to provide cheaper, variable-cost solutions.

**Use Case Expansion**: Ryght is initially focused on biopharma sales and marketing but has the opportunity to expand across the biopharma value-chain (see below). Analyst reports estimate a $40B market (Credit Suisse 2017; pg. 26) for data and analytics for pharmaceutical development and commercialization.

## Why now?
Increasing data volume, evidence of the value of precision medicine, and examples of strong ROI are driving biopharma interest in data and analytics, but internal biopharma data science teams and vendors are struggling to adapt.

**Increasing Data Volume**: Approximately 30% of the world's data volume is generated by healthcare and this data volume is growing at a 36% CAGR. In 2021, >80% of global pharma companies were operating in the cloud. Sanofi also estimated that ~2,000 TB of healthcare data per month were utilized for different data transformations internally. These trends indicate that pharma realizes the potential of this data and is actively trying to utilize this data to drive insights.

**Precision Medicine Driving Business Value**: The slow but steady march to precision medicine for oncology and beyond has reached an inflection point. In the 2010-2020 era, research showed that targets with genetic evidence of disease association were twice as likely to lead to approved drugs. In 2021, 2/3 of the 50 drugs approved by the FDA in 2021 were supported by genetic data, and not just in oncology. In 2023 and beyond, biopharma will leverage these same genetic insights to drive commercialization of these drugs.

**Strong ROI Even With Subpar Solutions**: Biopharma is an industry of fast-followers, and early examples of ROI are driving greater adoption of even subpar technology and analytics solutions. Novartis worked with Clarify, for example, on their sickle cell disease therapy (monthly infusion, $100K+/year) to use relatively simple SDoH data to understand patients' access to care, transportation, proximity to CoEs, income levels, and education. This work identified 14k additional patients ($300M in revenue potential) that would've been non-adherent simply based on their access to transportation.

**Biopharma Struggling to Hire Digital Talent**: The number of Chief Digital Officers in biopharma has exploded over the last 5 years and specific groups like Novartis' Data42 initiative have garnered a lot of interest. Unfortunately, many of these groups have waned over time because biopharma struggles to attract high-quality analytics and data science talent. Life sciences companies still trail cross-industry leaders by 2-3x in every key dimension in McKinsey's Digital Maturity Survey. We

Ryght Al - External Investment Memo 10

have seen multiple occasions where big names leave large tech or consumer companies to join biopharma and leave after a few years (Bertand Bodson @ Novartis; Jim Scholefield @ Merck; Marc Speichert @ GSK).

**Vendors are Struggling to Provide More Customized Workflows**: Without internal data science and analytics capabilities, biopharma looks to outsourced vendors to provide innovative solutions. These vendors are also struggling to deliver as biopharma asks for more workflows for more users to ask more questions. Clarify's current struggle, which is representative of others in market, is figuring out how to support this exploding number of workflows without hiring an army of developers, solutions engineers, and customer success reps to compensate for their clunky architecture. Despite their focus and investment, these companies inherently struggle because the change necessary to support these workflows would require them to re-architect their entire platform.

## Platform: Architecture and Real-time Ingestion Lay Foundation for LLMs
During the course of our diligence (and probably again by the time you are reading this memo), advances in open-source LLMs have changed how the AI

Ryght Al - External Investment Memo 11

community thinks about fine-tuning models for proprietary or domain-specific datasets. Ryght's microservices architecture and real-time ingestion engine give them the foundation to adapt to these changes, focus on their long-term differentiators, and leverage tools available in market to better fine-tune open-source models (MosaicML) or leverage vector databases for semantic search (Vectara).

At a high-level, we break the Ryght platform down into 2 parts.
*   **Technology Foundation**: Micro-services architecture and real-time ingestion.
*   **LLMs**: The natural language interface and data engineering under the hood.

The foundation alone is differentiated in market today, and LLM applications and tooling built on top provide additional value for end customers.

**Technology Foundation - Microservices Architecture and Real-time Ingestion**
The Ryght team has built large-scale, real-time streaming engines in prior companies that provide unique advantages for building Ryght's platform today.

**Architecture**: Over his decades of experience, John has lived through multiple hype cycles. As the Chief Java Architect of Sun Software Services, he not only saw the evolution of web services in the 1990's & early 00's, but literally wrote the book on best practices and design strategies. When people were asking about hype and reality of service oriented architecture in 2006, John was focused on solving problems for enterprise customers. Since then, he has worked in various CTO, VP of Engineering, and Chief AI roles at companies focused on real-time intelligence, visual analytics, edge computing, and AI.

Today with Ryght, John and team are building a platform that is highly decoupled and distributed. To optimize and scale, ingestion and inferencing will be segregated into microservices which can run on the customer's Azure, AWS, or any other cloud account. The core will run on Ryght's cloud of choice, but ingress and inferencing can happen on any cloud. The core platform will intermediate between the inference engines, Ryght vector databases, LLMs and other sources which are also distributed. This approach not only enables a diverse set of applications for customers, but provides strict tenant data isolation to ensure the separation of customer data and enterprise-grade privacy.

Ryght Al - External Investment Memo 12

**Real-time Ingestion**: Ryght's ability to ingest data and take action in real time is a radical change to the way existing platforms are organized around batch ingestion of new data at long intervals. Much of this learning was grounded in Simon and John's prior experiences. Deep Lens, for example, was acquired for its data assets, but its architecture and real-time ingestion capabilities allowed the company to collect that data and serve that data up to biopharma customers in a timely fashion. Deep Lens developed a new AWS based microservices architecture and deployed that into PHI in order to give a free workflow tool to community oncology providers. The company then deployed NLP for unstructured pathology, other lab results, and EMR data. Because this data was ingested in real-time, Deep Lens could also enable real-time patient matching for its customers. The historical dataset Deep Lens had representing 40 oncology Providers in 250 locations with 600 oncologists and >600K active oncology patients was part of the Paradigm acquisition, but the ability to continue to collect that data in real-time was just as important.

## LLM Applications and Tooling
LLMs build on top of this foundation and provide the opportunity to provide even more value for biopharma customers.

*   **Interface to enable business users to run analyses without expensive and slow data science teams**. LLMs augmented with a domain-specific knowledge base gives business users who can't code in Python or write SQL queries the ability to interact with data through natural language.
*   **Real-time insights to ensure timely access to data**. Under the hood, LLMs improve the speed, cost, and performance of data engineering tasks (entity resolution, code generation and review, data transformation, etc) for structured and unstructured data.

**Ryght's Approach**: Ryght will initially focus on prompt engineering, doing semantic search over vector databases, and RLHF before committing to fine-tuning models. We will walk through these approaches in order of increasing complexity and cost.

*Ryght May 2023 Investor Deck*

*   **Prompt Engineering and In-Context Learning**: Ryght will leverage the inherent capabilities of pre-trained open-source models and the power of prompt engineering to drive value out of the gate for customers. Prompt Engineering refers to methods leveraging in-context learning to communicate with LLM to steer its behavior for desired outcomes without updating the model weights. Simply by adjusting a prompt, transformers can be adapted to do many useful things without re-training, such as translation, question-answering, arithmetic, and many other tasks. Some approaches, such as prompt tuning, can actually provide similar performance compared to fine-tuning in models with 10B parameters.
*   **Vector DBs**: Rather than fine-tuning an existing model with lots of examples (30K), you can use an external vector database with embeddings of the knowledge and do semantic search with LLMs and return it. Vector DBs are used to search unstructured data in particular, but can tackle semi-structured and even structured data as well. For those questions that are more suited for structured analytics (e.g. SQL), there are LLMs that can help route a query to either a SQL database or vector database. Ryght can effectively leverage

Ryght Al - External Investment Memo 14

these techniques today for internal customer data and external data sources by leveraging popular vector databases like Pinecone and Vectara.
*   **Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF)**: RLHF is a process where human annotators examine instances of LLM outputs (multiple outputs for each prompt) and rank these outputs based on their preferences. To do this effectively, you need to know what questions to ask (e.g., what therapy do patients receive after failing SoC in AML? Can you rank HCPs by KRAS testing?) and what the answers should be. The Ryght team has biopharma industry experts who have been asking these questions for decades and data providers who understand the benefits and limitations of the data. Maybe more importantly, the experience and reputation of the Ryght team give them early inroads to build a trusted relationship with industry execs to co-develop solutions to answer new questions. A first-time founder or tech entrepreneur will struggle to get in those rooms and earn the trust of partners. For example, Ryght has seen 500 “prompts” (e.g., specific queries) from one Hc1 partner over 18 months, each of which can be stack ranked and replicated to other customers.
*   **Fine-tuning**: Although pre-trained LLMs possess a solid foundation of linguistic understanding, they often require customization to perform well on specific tasks or domains. Fine-tuning is the process of adjusting the weights of a pre-trained model by continuing its training on a smaller, task-specific dataset. This allows the model to better adapt to the nuances of the target task, improving its accuracy and relevance. While fine-tuning models is not the focus today, Ryght is looking at techniques like LoRA: Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models and Hugging Face adapters to create modular pluggable fine tuning that offers offers a more efficient alternative to traditional fine-tuning methods.

## Data: Initial Partnerships + Network Effects
Hc1 and each additional data platform partner will bring their proprietary data needed to support inference for their customers, and Ryght will do initial training on the full lake of their existing data and support inference from that and the ongoing data flux.

Ryght Al - External Investment Memo 15

**Why Do Partners Work With Ryght?** We've spoken with many potential partners to understand their reasoning and incentives. HC1, for example, can't meaningfully build advanced or generative AI applications because they lack the internal resources and talent. In our conversations with Head of Corporate Development at Komodo Health, who theoretically has the capabilities to build AI applications, he made clear that they don't want to build these AI solutions and are actively looking for a partner to build on top of their longitudinal claims repository. Even companies like Veeva, who recently launched a “CRM Bot” for sales reps, will struggle to create more advanced solutions because they cannot commit to re-engineering their platforms for AI. IQVIA, whose product team we've gotten more insight on based on another portfolio company, Mural Health, is hamstrung in building new solutions and would rather acquire / partner than build internally. Large retail health entrants such as CVS Health are also looking for external partners to help them build “their own Optum Insights”.

**Initial HC1 Partnership**: HC1's core business is to bring together disparate lab data sources with a customer-facing CRM and back-end data integration to drive insights that improve operations for labs (e.g., how do we improve turnaround time?) and help health systems provide higher quality care (e.g., are patients receiving appropriate testing?). Through these relationships, HC1 has gathered 220M patient profiles, 36B historical lab results, real-time access to 500M monthly lab results, and access to 20K thousand locations and 1.3M ordering providers, which it can then monetize with biopharma. This lab/dx data is extremely valuable on its own (test orders, results, patient diagnosis, some clinical history, provider information), but HC1's “Connect” platform is also an integration engine that allows HC1 to integrate customer data across EMR, billing, and other operational data (finance, inventory, etc).

**Data Ownership + Moats**: Even when data from a partner “leaves” the platform, LLMs retain the results of training on that data. Ryght is working with its corporate counsel, Wilson Sonsini on the correct and appropriate positioning to make sure the company retains the rights to these residuals even after data rights cease. This dynamic is a radical change in the industry as licensing (and use) is focused directly on the data itself today. It creates an opportunity for Ryght to leverage its industry connections to drive initial distribution and its industry knowledge to bootstrap the initial training by knowing what questions biopharma wants answered. Ryght's first-mover advantage builds competitive advantages in 3 phases:

1.  **First-Mover Phase**. Opportunity to move fast and train on as much data as possible before the industry sea-change (e.g., focus on residuals vs. data) is recognized. We've heard numerous times that biopharma customers are actively reaching out to their vendors asking what they are doing in AI, so vendors are highly incentivized to leverage Ryght for speed to market in this first phase.
2.  **Network-Effect Phase**. Once Ryght has multiple data partners on the platform from phase I, it becomes even more difficult for even sophisticated technology companies to justify building AI applications on their own. If a data owner uses their own data to train their own LLM, it will have limited capability to provide

Ryght Al - External Investment Memo 17

insights on that data. However, if the data owner contributes their data to Ryght's LLM and then uses its LLM for insights on that same data, they will get far better insights as they will be leveraging learnings from the entire partner network (e.g. a lab data provider benefiting from lab + EMR learnings).
3.  **Moat Phase**. A new entrant trying to attract a data provider won't have the network effect of (2) so the cost of contribution by the data provider will exceed the insight quality benefit they receive on their own.

## Multiple Elements of Competitive Advantage

**The Acuity Flywheel**
*   Obtain high flows of good data
*   Platform gets smarter than competition
*   More partners bring more data flow
*   Major first mover advantage
*   **Visual Flow:** More Data Volume & Diversity -> Increased LLM Acuity (residuals) -> Better BioPharma Insights -> More Partners & Users -> Obtain high flows of good data (and so on)

**Proprietary LLM-Independent Architecture**
*   Real time: high-capacity data ingestion
*   Accurate: RLHF community & verified prompts
*   Secure: strict tenant data isolation (encrypt)
*   Flexible: can switch foundational models
*   Defensible moat: retained residuals

*Ryght May 2023 Deck*

**Data Partnership Reference**: The scale of HC1's dataset is even more impressive when it is compared to the standard in market today. Ryght already has access to more data than Deep Lens, which was essentially acquired for its data assets and technology architecture alone. At the time of acquisition, Deep Lens had 40 oncology groups representing 250 locations and 600 oncologists, with 600,000 active oncology patients that were actively being treated. If we look at the rest of the pharma data landscape (image below, focus beyond claims), we see that these numbers also pale in comparison and are in the 1M-2M range. More importantly for Ryght's long-term vision, many of the larger datasets are not willing to link their datasets. Even those that do link datasets are limited to a small

N. Even the well-advertised Flatiron Health-Foundation Medicine linked clinico-genomic database is limited to 69K patients.

## GTM: Partner + Direct
Ryght's vision is to build the Force.com (now Salesforce Platform) for LLMs in biopharma and underpins its initial partnership and direct-to-biopharma GTM strategy. Whether it's a partner like hc1 who will be selling the hc1.AI apps to their customers, or Mirati, who would be the end user themselves, Ryght provides the infrastructure and toolsets to build high-quality AI applications quickly. Salesforce launched Force.com for other enterprises to build software leveraging its infrastructure. Salesforce has since built a cloud marketplace (AppExchange) and now has multiple billion dollar companies based on its ecosystem (Veeva, nCino, OwnBackup).

## Go To Market - Microsoft Channel and Direct Sales

**Synthetica Platform: Real-time System Design/Leverages Foundation Models**

**Input Data & Apps:**
*   Partner Data
*   Partner App
*   Customer Data
*   Customer App
*   3rd Party Data
*   Synthetica App

**Partners & Customers (Logos above data flows):**
*   hc1
*   lucemhealth.
*   COVANCE
*   Syneos Health
*   MIRATI THERAPEUTICS
*   +BEKHEALTH

**Sales Channels:**
*   Microsoft Channel Sales (under Microsoft Azure logo)
*   Direct Sales (under Microsoft Azure logo)

**Partner**: Ryght is engaging software and data vendors (Hc1, Caris, Lucem Health, etc), CROs (Syneos) and cloud-providers (Azure) that need AI solutions for their biopharma customer base.

Hc1, Syneos, and Caris Life Sciences have all showed initial interest with Hc1 furthest along (data contract with 5-year term). These partners need to reduce the cost of labor to fulfill sales inquiries and data extractions, which requires experienced data scientists, bioinformaticists, and engineers. Hc1, for example, is answering hundreds of pre-sales requests per quarter, nearly all of which require multiple re-runs or adjustments. The space is competitive and vendors are pressured by pharma to respond to tight RFP timelines, often requiring skilled labor to work evenings and weekends to fulfill basic data extractions (e.g. "how many NSCLC patients with an EGFR exon20ins that have failed 1st line therapy?"). The tight timelines and volumes of inquiries lead to clerical errors or misinterpretations of the request, which results in a lost deal and a dent to the vendor's credibility. In the second phase of development with Hc1, Ryght can also power a direct salesforce leveraging Ryght's technology as Hc1 currently sells through a channel.

In addition, Simon and team are leveraging previous successful relationships from Predixion to work with the Microsoft Healthcare/Life Sciences Team. Ryght is

Ryght Al - External Investment Memo 20

currently using Azure and will be initially in the Pegasus program before becoming an enterprise partner, which means that the global reps can recommend Ryght AI because it pulls through Azure credits and usage. Simon's connections from Predixion (e.g., Kevin Dolan) run this channel and Kevin has plugged Ryght into the global GTM team. In addition, Mike Flannagan, a Deep Lens and now Ryght AI investor who runs customer success globally, is helping with senior relationship building.

**Direct**: Ryght can also go direct to biopharma customers (e.g., Mirati) and sell its own applications to customers based on learnings embedded in its LLMs from data partners, internal data, or external 3rd party data sources. The company will target companies currently spending on ML/Data science/IT teams (Pharma) or with limited resources but AI needs (Biotech). Similar to the partner process described above, the platform and approach enables Ryght to reduce some of complex and time consuming behavior between biopharma identifying a question they want to ask ("How many patients have a rising PSA over a two year period?') and a defined deliverable.

**Mirati Example**: Mirati, who Ryght is already in conversations with, is competing with Amgen to launch a targeted therapy for NSCLC patients with KRAS mutations ($1B+ annual revenue at peak according to sell-side consensus). Mirati is preparing for launch and is a year behind its rival Amgen. Mirati wants to utilize Ryght to enable its sales force (slide 15) to better highlight its unique clinical profile (longer half-life, better targeting of CNS metastasis), encourage identification of all eligible patients, and support distribution into community oncology practices. From this initial use case, Ryght could expand to help Mirati run a post-marketing study to test lower dosing that was recently required by the FDA (commercial) or understand the impact that the available patient pool for KRAS testing would have on their inclusion/exclusion criteria for upcoming studies to push its drug into first-line therapy use in NSCLC or other indications (R&D).

## Business Model: Consumption-Based Model + Tiered Offering
While Force.com provides a model to think about distribution and building an ecosystem, Ryght is embracing the shift in economic models for software businesses over the last two decades and employing a consumption-based business model.

Ryght Al - External Investment Memo 21

**Consumption-based model**: Ryght is providing a flexible platform to serve data partners and biopharma customers directly to train, tune, store, and/or perform inference on valuable datasets depending on their needs. While the unit of measure (see below) may differ by client, we think about a simple equation:
*   **# of Insights = Customers x Users x Business Questions x Providers x Data Sources x Metrics.**

Ryght can optimize multiple pieces of this equation based on its particular client and use-case.

## Organizing Market Players on Key Usage-based Model Dimensions

**Units of Measure on Which Pricing is Based**
*   **Data Volume Driven**: pricing based on $ per GB per hour or per day or per month or per year
*   **Compute Driven**: pricing based on $ per CPU/hour, $ per vCPU/hour or $ per compute credit/hour
*   **Entity Driven**: pricing based on $ per host, $ per cluster or $ per device or $ per user

**Companies by Pricing Model Focus (as depicted in diagram):**
*   **Data Volume**: CONFLUENT, sumologic (SU MO), splunk>
*   **Compute or Workload**: snowflake
*   **# of Entities**: DATADOG, mongoDB
*   **Other/Mixed**: New Relic (positioned between Compute and Entities)

*Source: Morgan Stanley Research*

Consumption-based revenue models (e.g., C3.ai below) typically hit a J-Curve vs. subscription revenue models in Year 1. In Year 2 exponential growth starts to kick in, and by Year 3 consumption revenue starts to beat subscription revenue and continue to grow. The Ryght team has deep experience in the space and knowledge of current budgets and subscription models in pharma. The team can essentially "goal-seek” initial pricing to ensure they are in the range of current 7-figure ACV contracts while setting up a long-term foundation for companies to run

Ryght Al - External Investment Memo 22

more models and grow the overall size of the pie. This strategy to grow the overall pie is similar to dbt. When dbt initially launched in 2017, a big dbt project was 500 models. Today, a big dbt project is >5k models.

## Consumption Based Revenue Transition (C3.ai)

**Graph Description:**
A graph showing two curves (Consumption Revenue Model and Subscription Revenue Model) over 13 Quarters. The Subscription Revenue Model starts higher and declines slightly before stabilizing. The Consumption Revenue Model starts lower, dips, then accelerates sharply from Quarter 3 onwards, surpassing the Subscription Revenue Model around Quarter 7-8 and continuing to grow significantly.

**Phase 1 - Introduction & Transition (Quarters 1-3):**
*   First pilots started along with trials
*   Pilots have a lower TCV and higher initial investment costs
*   Revenue growth flattens and gross margin compresses

**Phase 2 - Deal Ramp & Early Consumption (Quarters 3-7):**
*   Increased number of pilots and more customers convert to consumption
*   Revenue decline bottoms
*   Total revenue growth and gross margin improve

**Phase 3 - Scale out & Consumption Acceleration (Quarters 7-13):**
*   Larger number of customers have converted to consumption
*   Revenue growth accelerates and gross margin trends toward pre-transition level (high 70s)

*C3.ai Investor Presentation*

**Tiered Offering**: The enterprise and co-develop offering are the initial focus, but the community and builder version of the platform can drive platform improvements and enable product-led growth. The Community version of the platform will drive adoption, virality, and will inform an industry leading prompt library with prompt verification. This provides Ryght with a community of experts that are essentially doing human reinforcement learning to improve quality and reduce hallucinations, and eventually upsell users to the enterprise edition. The builder version is similar to the community version but with more support and sophistication.

## Competitive Landscape: “Switzerland” Approach
The competitive landscape for biopharma analytics across commercial and R&D is complex. To simplify this landscape, we think about the data flowing from: **systems of record → middleware → systems of admin → systems of intelligence**. Ryght is starting in the commercial space displacing and taking share from systems of intelligence, but its platform positioning and partnership strategy can impact the entire ecosystem across different systems in R&D and commercial.

| **Middleware** | **Tokenization/Synthetic Data/etc:** Software tools to de-identify or transform data to be fit for use. For example, Datavant has more of a deterministic approach (tokenized with hash function) while HealthVerity has more of a probabilistic approach to de-identify data. | **Shift dynamics.** Datavant and some of these other aggregators are often viewed as gatekeepers by data providers. Datavant's hashing technique is not differentiated. The company was funded by Roivant without worrying about revenue until they saw enough network effects to monetize. If Ryght is successful, the company will decrease the value of these vendors and enable data providers to have a larger piece of a growing pie. |

## Financing / Milestones
With early momentum in sales conversations and an early data partnership with Hc1, Ryght can hit the ground running over the next 12 months with this $3M round.

**Product development**: Ryght's product is currently in the research and design phase. The company has an exemplar architecture in place and will spend the next 3 months building it out. The timeline for the different tiered product offerings is:
*   **Co-development**: Initial focus over the next 4-6 months. Ryght will continue building the platform for Hc1 and other partner use cases.
*   **Enterprise**: Early beta in 6 months
*   **Builder/Community**: Early alpha in 3 months, early beta in 6 months

**Milestones to Raise a Series A**: Key milestones to raise a strong Series A ($10M+) include:
*   Launch of the Hc1 app for their lab customers
*   First biopharma app customer up and running

*   Demonstration of accumulate and retain training residuals from multiple data sources and resulting improved inference capability
*   Deployment and lock in of HC1 data and others
*   Viral uptake of the community edition (Qlik, Tableau)

## Opportunities / Risks

## Opportunities

*   **Experienced team + domain knowledge.** Simon, Alex, John, Brad, Alexi, and Tyrone each independently get us excited about the potential to build a large and transformational business. Together, they comprise a unique and complementary team that brings years of 0 → 1 experience in the life sciences and AI domain. They have also been able to attract world-class advisors (Tom Pike, CEO @ LabCorp; Hisham Hamadeh SVP, Global Head of Data Science & AI @ Genmab) to support their vision. We always index on A+ founding teams but even more so in this current market environment and in an industry like biopharma where industry connections and relationships drive initial distribution.
*   **High-Margin Pharma Data and Analytics Business.** Biopharma data and analytics is a $40B market with strong market tailwinds where R&D spend and drug sales are historically resilient through economic recessions. These businesses have the potential to generate seven or eight figure ACVs with sticky recurring revenues and high gross margins (60%-80%). Public comps historically trade at a multiple of the S&P 500 for good reason.
*   **First-Mover Advantage(s).** The initial data partnership with Hc1 drives early sales conversations and distribution, which leads to more partners and users on the platform and more data volume and diversity. By building a Switzerland-like platform that hosts data from multiple partners and retaining the rights to those residuals, Ryght has the opportunity to move fast and train on as much data as possible. In 1-2 years when Ryght has multiple data partners, other data owners who want to train an LLM will get more value from Ryght's combined insights from multiple datasets than their own internal data.
*   **Technology Foundation.** Beyond LLMs, Ryght is building a flexible technology architecture, real-time ingestion, and secure platform that other companies

Ryght Al - External Investment Memo 28

will struggle to do without re-engineering their entire platform. Startups (Komodo, Clarify, Flatiron) and incumbents (Veeva, IQVIA) alike will both struggle with this technical debt and Ryght has the opportunity to take advantage.

## Risks

*   **Competitive Dynamics with Gen AI / Risk(s) of Obsolescence.** Ryght faces competition from large incumbents in the space (Veeva, IQVIA), later-stage startups (Tempus, Komodo, Clarify), and potential fast-follower startups that may launch in the coming months or years. We have seen this dynamic countless times already in the enterprise tech space with companies like Jasper (copywriting) and Fixie (plug-ins) becoming (near) obsolete overnight upon the newest OpenAI product and/or feature announcements. The domain-specific focus in biopharma and conversations with other companies in the space to understand their capabilities give us confidence in Ryght to maintain differentiation over the long-term. The biggest contributor to our confidence, however, is due to Ryght's architecture and real-time ingestion capabilities. Even if the playing field is leveled with respect to AI, their approach to building systems architecture and a real-time ingestion platform is highly differentiated and will take years to recreate.
*   **Durability of Data Relationships.** The approach to retain training residuals from multiple data sources to improve inference capability may pose a risk if customers and partners become concerned their data is being “recorded”. To mitigate this risk early on, Ryght is working closely with company counsel to ensure proper licensing agreements. In our conversations, industry today is more worried about the privacy concerns of employees leaking sensitive data vs. asking about rights to training residuals from their data sources. Ryght is focused from day 1 on building strict tenant data isolation to ensure the strict separation of customer data. Over the mid/long-term, however, we believe the ultimate driver of durability will be the value of the insights Ryght provides.
*   **Utilization Among End-Business User(s).** Biopharma customers today are asking for easy-to-use tools for domain experts and business users, but historically biopharma has used to consultants and outsourced analytics to black-box vendors. There is a risk that this dynamic and workflow continues to persist even with the advance of new tooling and workflows, reducing the

Ryght Al - External Investment Memo 29

ultimate value of Ryght's platform. To mitigate this risk, Ryght is heavily focused on using its co-development partnerships and community to surface 100s of prompts to ensure accuracy and drive insights that users want and enterprises will pay for.
