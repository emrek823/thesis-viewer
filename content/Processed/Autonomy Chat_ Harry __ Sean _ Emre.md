### Investment Thesis & Autonomy Overview

- Harry’s background
	- Lower East Side NYC resident
	- Psychology/neuroscience undergrad
	- Mother owned neurology practice (35 years, Seattle area)
	- Witnessed workflow inefficiencies firsthand
- Virtue VC investment rationale
	- First investment from second fund ($100M+ AUM)
	- 30% allocation to care delivery models (unusually low for healthcare VCs)
	- High bar for care delivery investments
	- Autonomy met criteria as first neuro-focused investment

### Market Dynamics & Tailwinds

- Neurology market structure
	- ~20,000 neurologists nationally
	- Highly fragmented (typical practice: 3-5 neurologists)
	- Largest practices only 20-25 providers
	- Quick decision-making vs large health systems
- Key growth drivers
	- Drug pipeline momentum - neuro is “oncology of 2010s”
	- Ancillary revenue opportunities (MS drugs, Botox injections)
	- Demographics driving Alzheimer’s/Parkinson’s demand
	- Window to preserve private practice vs health system consolidation
- Competitive landscape
	- Anira Medical: acquisition-focused (traditional PE approach)
	- Various consulting services (limited ongoing value)
	- Multi-specialty MSOs (neuro as one of many)
	- Virtual care models (team skeptical for complex neuro conditions)

### Founder Assessment & Value Creation

- Nat & Rue partnership strength
	- 10-year working relationship across 3 organizations
	- Previous healthcare company building/scaling experience
	- Nat’s investor background: led investments in top-performing MSOs

	- Network introductions to successful MSO founders
	- Access to LP network (insurers, hospital systems, pharma)
	- Active hiring support and talent pool access
	- Focus on 0-to-1 period foundation building

### Growth Strategy & Exit Pathway

- Value accruing to services layer vs software layer
- GTM approach: boots on the ground, practice-by-practice embedding
- Build vs buy decisions critical for scaling to 100+ practices
- Revenue focus over cost savings
	- Drug margin capture primary value driver
	- High-value ancillaries (infusions, imaging)
- Clear exit comparables
	- Retina Consultants of America, oncology MSOs, GI Alliance
	- Acquisition targets for Cardinals, McKessons, Sankaras
	- $2B+ valuations based on provider count and drug margin access
- Timeline expectations
	- Series A likely 2026
	- Acquisition offers possible 24-36 months post-Series A
