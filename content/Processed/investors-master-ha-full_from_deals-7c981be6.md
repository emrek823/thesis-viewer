## Slide 1: Getting on a Specialty Treatment is

*   Scary
*   Complicated
*   Expensive
*   Confusing

**Speech Bubbles:**
*   How much is it going to cost?
*   Rx Where was my prescription sent?
*   Do I have to pick up my prescription?
*   I haven't gotten a call yet ... should I call my doctor?
*   Where is my prescription?
*   Incoming Call: Unknown Number

## Slide 14: Competitive Landscape: Pharma Patient Services Platforms

**Text:** Siloed patient-facing platforms like adherence apps and portals end up adding friction to patient onboarding. HelpAround removes friction by connecting services and vendors across the entire patient journey, behind the scenes.

## Slide 15: When patients drop-off, everyone loses

**Key Statement:** 27% of patient drop-off is related to Access challenges

**Impact of Drop-off:**
*   The Patient loses doesn't get access to the treatment
*   The Pharma loses doesn't provide the medication
*   Specialty Pharmacies don't get to dispense
*   Payers & Employers increased cost of hospitalization

**Visuals:**
*   Four downward arrows representing losses for:
    *   Patient
    *   Pharma
    *   Specialty Pharmacy
    *   Payer

**Pharma Only Calculation:**
$8.2B total addressable market = 7M patients x $98 per month x 12 months
(U.S. Specialty Patients) (demonstrated pricing)
