### Oct-25 Actual vs. Forecast¹ Results

| Category            | Oct-25 Actual | Oct-25 Forecast | Var F(U)      |
|---------------------|---------------|------------------|---------------|
| Net Revenue         | $96,552       | $320,956         | ($224,404)    |
| Pat Care Expenses    | $377,899      | $403,303         | $25,404       |
| Gross Profit        | ($281,347)    | ($82,347)        | ($199,000)    |
| Account Management   | $44,159       | $168,364         | $124,205      |
| CM                  | ($325,506)    | ($250,711)       | ($74,795)     |
| S,G&#x26;A               | $615,104      | $694,289         | $79,185       |
| EBITDA              | ($940,610)    | ($945,000)       | $4,390        |

1. As a reminder, we are continuing to report results against the May-25 forecast.

Net revenue fell short of forecast due to a combination of delayed payor contracting, scheduling required new physicians to take activations before their payor credentialing was complete, creating unbillable episodes, and below forecast EMS activation volume. See p. 3 for more detail.

Patient Care Expenses were below forecast due to the med mal renewal coming in $12k below forecast.

Physician comp, our largest Patient Care cost, rose $10k m/m because we overstaffed based on an incorrect Fort Worth EMS activation volume estimate. We’re now unwinding this overstaffed schedule, which carries a 60-day tail because of the work-hour commitments we make to our 1099 physicians.

However, due to the activation volume increase month over month (despite missing our overall target set in May’s model), the cost per episode came down for the second month in a row, declining $18. See p. 5 for more detail.

SG&#x26;A was well below forecast due to the hiring freeze; the May forecast model included 36 FTEs as compared to 26 actual at the end of the month.

## MD&#x26;A

### October Snapshot
- Activations came in below forecast -22% for Oct, and -8% YTD. Georgia was again the primary driver of the Activation miss -22% for Oct and -11% YTD, though Texas activations also came in below forecast -11% for Oct and +1% YTD due to timing of the DFW MSA. Florida was well below goal due to de-emphasis.
- Diversions were below forecast across all regions -23% for Oct, and -10% YTD. The m/m increase in the diversion rate (+5%) was a result of our new physicians climbing the learning curve of more diversions in a telehealth activation - a new skill for them.

### November Snapshot
- Our improved data model now shows actual vs estimated potential activation volume in EMS operations. EMS leadership is acting on these findings and raising activation volume targets. Early signs are encouraging, with the 7-day rolling average up 7% in Nov, from 61 to 66.
- Georgia: Updated Grady dispatch analysis shows about 50 RightSite-eligible activations/day, which is 27 more than we are capturing now. Grady EMS leadership approved a full-time RightSite medic in the dispatch center to catch these missed activations. The embedded RightSiter started on November 20, and early results look promising (this might be a future strategy for all large EMS agencies). We also have 5 EMS agencies in contracting that represent another 15 activations/day.
- Texas: San Antonio responded well to our action plan with a 21% increase in overall activations. An additional Houston area (Montgomery County) agency went live using our improved pre-sales data modeling and initial activations are meeting expectations. 7 agencies are in contracting, totaling approximately +8 additional activations per day.
- Florida: Ongoing Jacksonville political issues are now coming to a head (finally) and assuming we have resolution, we could start our EMS and payor expansion work in Florida in Q1:26.

- Net Revenue was $96.6k, a negative variance (-$224k)
- lower activation/diversion volume
- new physicians missing credentialing
- delayed case rate contracting (approximately 53% of the miss, or $119k)

- Net Revenue / Episode was $80, a negative variance (-$130)
- GA net rev / episode rose from $87 to $122 (+29%)

- Patient Care Cost / Episode was a negative variance (-$49) due to physician overstaffing and below forecast activation volume
- However, Patient Care Cost / Episode was $18 below prior month due to the increase in net activations (+103 total; +3/day) over September. We continue to evaluate and deploy new strategies to reduce patient care costs, primarily around physician hiring and staffing.

### Notes:
- Net Revenue: -$224k
- Gross Profit: –$199k
- Patient Care Expenses: +$25.4k
- Transportation: +$10.3k from updated transport guidelines
- Alternate Site Care: +$2.1k from lower utilization as Care Team provides this service based on if patients belong to a case-rate contracted payer, or if they were treated in an ER vs diverted.

- Contribution Margin: -$74.8k
- SG&#x26;A: +$79.2k

- Revenue Cycle: -$39.2k; cost reductions to come via new contract effective Nov-25
- Professional Fees: -$6.1k
- IT + Travel: +$25.5k from lower spend after the hiring freeze
- Insurance: -$6.4k from prepaid amortization
