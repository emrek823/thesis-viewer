### CloudCruise Overview & Technology

- AI agent automation platform with verifiable reliability guarantees for computer workflows
- Hybrid approach: AI builds workflows, then runs deterministically for guaranteed execution
	- Uses domain-specific language (JSON) for surface independence
	- Supports both browser and desktop automation (56% of addressable market is desktop apps)
	- Builder agent translates natural language SOPs/videos into JSON workflows
	- Self-healing maintenance agent fixes errors automatically or notifies users
- Current metrics: 24,000 computer hours last quarter (equivalent of 50 FTEs automated), $300k ARR
- Continuous screen recording for auditability and error recovery

### Healthcare Market Focus & Strategy

- Strong organic pull from healthcare despite starting horizontal
- Revenue cycle management complexity created natural fit
	- RCM addressable market: $2.1B ARR total
	- Claims processing & eligibility verification alone: $1.1B
- Regulated industries strategy: solving for highest reliability/security requirements enables expansion to finance, logistics, government
- Customer expansion example: urgent care EHR system customer scaling 100x usage over next months
- Pricing: ~20 eligibility checks per browser hour, customers already reaching $80k annual spend

### Funding Round Status

- Raising $5-7M, finalizing lead investors this week
- Two funds currently in diligence as potential leads
