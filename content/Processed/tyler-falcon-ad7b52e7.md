High-level overview

Why now. You touched on recent FWA cases bringing these issues top of mind for ACOs. What else is driving the “why now” for Falcon? What makes Falcon possible today vs. 3 years ago?

Lessons learned. Where does value accrue for vendors and software companies in the VBC analytics space? There’s a number of companies that have failed to scale beyond a “nice-to-have” analytics platform. What have you guys learned from your experiences and how does that inform the current build at Falcon?

Long-term vision. You talked through the plan for 2025 (e.g., FWA to get in with customers, layer on network optimization for next 10-20 customers). What’s next? What does Falcon look like at $10M ARR? $50M ARR?

Product

Current products. You broke down Sentinel (prevent and reconcile), Scope, and Network Optimization on Monday. For these 3 (or if you guys want to break it down in a different way) can you share:

What is the current state of product readiness (MVP vs. ready to scale)?

What is the specific deliverable to customers and who is the user (e.g., report or analytics dashboard for VP)?

What specific experiments do you want to run this year for these products? We like how you phrased these products as “ways to experiment” in the previous call.

Driving Action for Prevent and Reconcile. Let’s really dive deep on how you drive action for both prevent and reconcile for FWA. For example, you identify a provider is not following guidelines for use of injectable drug and using longer than needed - how do you impact provider behavior to drive value for ACO? You’ve identified larger historical fraud with skin grafts over the past 2 years - how do you actually recoup the money?

Data. What datasets do you have internally (publically available data, VRDC, etc)? What data do you collect from customers in addition to that? What other datasets would you like to collect in ideal world?

Product roadmap. You touched on network optimization at the end of the call as you already expand beyond Sentinel and Scope. With 2-3 more engineers, what else is on the product roadmap for 2025?

Integration work required. What is the current process to integrate and go live with a customer? How does that differ, if at all, for FWA vs. network optimization (e.g., is FWA more lightweight and then you upsell with deeper integration later with network optimization)?

Commercial

Current customers. Can you break down the current 3 customers (# of providers / members, tech sophistication, sales cycle/how you sold, potential ACV, etc) and current status with each?

Pipeline. You mentioned some other potential customers in the pipeline - what does the pipeline look like currently? Do you want to exclusively focus on ACOs over the next 1-2 years or will you sell to other risk-bearing entities?

Value Prop/Pricing. How much value ($) are you providing customers and how much of that can you potentially capture with a software solution? The exact pricing and business model is ever changing at the early-stage so we typically think about it more in terms of the value or ROI you are providing customers.

GTM strategy. What is your GTM strategy and how do you build a repeatable sales motion beyond founder-led sales? You mentioned on the call that the product is ready to sell and you’re waiting for commercial folks to drive growth.

Financing

Milestones. What are the 2-3 things you have to get right with this $2-$3m raise?

Team. What other team members do you want to bring on over the next 6-12 months? You touched on this a bit towards the end of the previous call (e.g., 1-2 sales people, 2-3 product folks).
