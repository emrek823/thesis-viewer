## Slide 8: QUALITY – Clarify analytics driving patients' decision-making in choosing top quality hospitals in Cigna's network

**CIGNA CENTERS OF EXCELLENCE 2021 METHODOLOGY**
For hospitals
October 2020
Together, all the way. Cigna

**Patient outcomes data sources**
For 2021, we assessed the quality of care of the treatment provided for the 18 surgical procedures and medical conditions shown in Tables 1A and 1B using measures of patient outcomes derived from publicly available, hospital self-reported data and claims data. The dataset was sourced from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Medicare fee schedules, and Clarify Health Solutions' (Clarify) proprietary commercial dataset (Commercial, Medicare Advantage, and Managed Medicaid) representing 40 million, and 120 million+ annual lives, respectively, across all 50 states and the District of Columbia (DC). We used the reporting period of January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2018.

Each quality metric is risk adjusted by comparing the sample observed score to the Clarify expected score, computed from their clearinghouse of commercial and government paid claims data and using proprietary calculation models. In rare instances where Clarify models do not converge, a national average becomes the comparator to the sample observed score. After risk-adjustment, scores for complications, HAI and mortality rates are combined in a weighted average manner. Resulting scores in each data set are combined using a volume weighted average, and are then split to create two peer groups for teaching hospitals vs. non-teaching hospitals.

## Slide 9: CUSTOMERS – Clarify becoming essential to better decision-making

**NewYork-Presbyterian**
"This data is great and we've been using it at all levels in our organization. I shared some Clarify analyses with the Chair of Radiology at Columbia and now he wants to include it in a presentation he's working on for the Dean"
– Financial Director

**MEMORIAL HERMANN**
"We took this data to Feby (Chief Strategy Officer) and I wanted to let you know we've communicated how much value you have created for this organization in such short amount of time. We're going to introduce this data to the Board next. It'll be the first time they have seen this sort of data."
– Director of Strategy

**Cigna**
The team realizes the power of the data available in Clarify, so there is a lot of demand for using this for our contracting analysis which is the reason for the increased asks over the last few weeks.
– HealthSpring Mid-Atlantic and Pennsylvania Markets

**Cleveland Clinic**
This tool is way more intuitive to use than anything I've seen before. We've historically struggled with end-user adoption due to ease of use.

**Humana**
What you [Clarify] produced will present very well to the MA Market leaders and serve as directional food for thought until insights on Humana trend savings are available.

## Slide 10: INNOVATION – Our platform is now generating almost 18 billion predictions per year across our data assets

**Clarify Exploratory Model**

* **219** metrics with predictions¹
* **134 million** patient lives per year on datasets used
* **17.99 billion** predictions generated in Prism

1. Expected values
Note: Have excluded data sets where expected value is not applicable (e.g., CMS Expecteds on commercial data)

Confidential 10

## Slide 11: Scaling our products and platform

## Slide 12: Impact requires scale

**Customers x Users x Business Questions x Providers x Data Sources x Metrics = # of Insights**

* **139** Dashboards
* **700+** Users
* **739K** Physicians
* **65** ARR Contracts
* **2.5X** Data sources
* **5400** Metrics
* **300M** Patients

Confidential 12

## Slide 13: Scaled Product delivery is a battle on many fronts

* **User Experience is Personal**
    With six Products and a multitude of user personas, how can we unlock new insights and tailor workflows without an army of developers?

* **An Explosion of Insights and Data**
    With so many moving parts, how do we ensure that each insight we deliver to a customer is of high quality?

* **Every Customer is Different**
    How can do we support customers in different markets with different needs without a maintenance nightmare?

Confidential 13

## Slide 14: How do we efficiently scale our UI content?

**So What's the Problem?**
* 6 Products, 139 Dashboards in production... and growing **quickly**
* Every user persona has a different workflow and their own slew of critical business questions
* We constantly learn from the market and our customers

**Our challenge?**
* Support an exploding number of workflows
* Iterate quickly
* Do it without an army of developers

Confidential 14

## Slide 15: Ingredient 1: Intuitive information architecture and navigation

* **Move from visualization-driven to entity-driven navigation**
    * I want Hackensack Meridian PCP performance, not tools to go find it
* **Focus on insights, not capabilities**
    * Who are my best performers? Worst? Where do I have the most opportunity?
* **Anticipate the next question - drill through to any level of detail, but easily find your way home**
    * Unless they can see the detail under this, my provider partners won't trust it
* **Find the common patterns**
    * Distill navigation patterns required across all of our products into a master pattern to minimize bespoke developer work

* Implementation teams can iterate on customer configuration with less need for Product or Platform

**Is it working?**
* Customers are buying
* Producing product-specific content at 6x the rate we could at the beginning of the year
* Clarify Referrals implementations down from 12 weeks to 2-3 weeks

## Slide 20: Every customer is different – in different ways

* "We organize our service lines differently"
* "I need this screen to include my own provider labels"
* "I only care about the Nevada market"
* "I only want to evaluate orthopedists"
* "I don't think about networks at the individual provider level"
* "I need this for every new therapy I'm considering licensing - but I don't know what they are yet"

## Slide 21: Scaling strategy 1: E Pluribus Unum

**Building a network**
* Each customer licenses distinct geographies
* Some work at the Physician level, some at the Contracting Entity level
* Some want to focus on target specialties

**Every customer needs a different configuration**

**What if we didn't have to care?**
* 3,226 Counties
* 739,000 Physicians
* 300,000,000 Patients

**ONE national configuration**
**Every Physician and Contracting Entity scored across 629 efficiency, quality, and referral metrics**

## Slide 33: Impact: Moments from the team

**Winning a street fight**
"You guys way outshine Crimson Market Advantage. I love how transparent your methodology is.”
– Senior Strategy Team Member, Hackensack Meridian Health

**Unlocking long-needed change**
"This is simply just amazing work. I haven't had access to this kind of data in the 10 years I've been in this space. It's all been anecdotal. I'm both scared and excited to see what I'm about to find!"
– Director of Children's Services, MEMORIAL HERMANN

**Hitting the mark on customers' needs**
"It's like you guys were literally in my brain!"
– Sr. Director, Network Analytics, Cigna®

"What I've told others looking for a new market and referrals platform is that if you're okay with inconsistent estimates, there are a lot of products out there. If you want 90% accuracy in insights, use Clarify"
– SVP of Strategic Initiatives, JOHN MUIR HEALTH

**Accelerating patient impact**
"This is a gamechanger for us! Now we can accurately gauge protocol feasibility and not waste time pursuing physicians who don't treat patients who actually qualify for the trial. We need to share this with headquarters.”
– Director, Clinical Trial Management, novo nordisk

## Slide 40: Results: Diversification for scale and sustained growth

**Key Takeaways:**
*   Significant shift from reliance on advisor and team referrals in FY-20 to 80% of pipeline generation driven by Sales and Marketing efforts in FY-21
*   Advisor and team referrals still convert at healthy rate, so should remain in the demand gen formula in FY-22
*   Stronger Marketing/ Sales/ SDR collaboration across programs
*   Upsell/Cross-sell has the strongest conversion => key focus area in FY-22 as customer base expands
