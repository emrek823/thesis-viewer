December 2028. Maria's AI agent is negotiating simultaneously with twelve different vendors for her daughter's upcoming birthday party. Within minutes, it secured the perfect cake from a local bakery (after verifying their nut-free certification), booked an entertainer with stellar safety ratings, and coordinated custom goodie bags filled with each child's favorite treats (after checking allergies and dietary restrictions with the other parents' agents)—all while staying 15% under budget. What would have taken Maria hours of calls, emails, and anxiety about vendor reliability now happens seamlessly through a web of agent-to-agent interactions powered by the new infrastructure we explored in [our previous post](https://www.aitidbits.ai/p/ai-agents-web-infrastructure).

The revolution in web infrastructure we discussed in previous posts isn't just theoretical—it's enabling fundamental changes in how commerce, marketing, and customer service function. As [agent passports](https://www.aitidbits.ai/p/ai-agents-web-infrastructure#:~:text=intelligently.%20Enter%20the-,Agent%20Passport,-.) and trust protocols become standardized, we're witnessing the emergence of entirely new commercial paradigms.

With the recent release of Tasks by OpenAI, which equips ChatGPT—its consumer-facing AI—with the ability to perform tasks behind the scenes on behalf of users, it's now easier than ever to envision a future where ChatGPT seamlessly navigates the web and handles complex operations for us.

ChatGPT can now set reminders and perform recurring actions

Today, we'll explore how an agent-first internet will reshape domains like payments, marketing, support, and localization.

## **Agentic payments**

Remember when online shopping first emerged, and entering your credit card details on a website felt risky? Card networks like Visa and Mastercard and banks like Chase and Barclays had to rapidly adapt to the digital realm, introducing new protocols like CVV codes and secure payment gateways to protect consumers and merchants alike. This evolution was pivotal in building trust and facilitating the e-commerce boom of the early 2000s, giving birth to digital payment giants like Stripe and PayPal.

Similarly, the payment infrastructure that powers today's internet was built around a simple dichotomy: card-present versus card-not-present transactions and the assumption that all payments are human-initiated. The internet already faced a similar shift with the introduction of subscription payments in the early days of e-commerce, in which customers input their payment credentials once, allowing a merchant to charge them repeatedly in the future. Recurring payments, now a dominant commerce mechanism projected to surpass [$2.4T in spending](https://www.pymnts.com/subscription-commerce/2023/how-transparency-and-high-earners-power-a-96-billion-subscription-industry/) by 2028, underscore how critical adaptive payment systems are to supporting global e-commerce. Yet, even more than a decade later, there are still countries like India that [impose strict controls](https://www.pymnts.com/news/international/2021/did-rbi-rule-kill-recurring-payments-india/) on recurring payments, highlighting the complexities of adapting systems to new paradigms.

But what happens when the legitimate transacting party isn’t human at all?

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!kZRV!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F42913aa8-104c-407b-ac1d-04a2db814bf0_800x395.gif)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!kZRV!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F42913aa8-104c-407b-ac1d-04a2db814bf0_800x395.gif)

Digital payment systems are built around human users, employing measures like CVV codes and billing address verification to prevent fraud. These methods assume a human is initiating the transaction, making them ill-suited for autonomous agent transactions.

One major challenge is fraud detection and resolution—an area I intimately understand from my time as a PM at Stripe, where I worked closely with card issuers to develop sophisticated fraud prevention systems. The current paradigm relies heavily on human behavioral patterns: typing speed, mouse movements, time spent reviewing checkout pages, and other signals that indicate legitimate human activity. But in an agent-driven world, these signals become obsolete.

During my time at Stripe, we saw how crucial these behavioral signals were for differentiating legitimate transactions from fraudulent ones. The shift to agent-driven commerce demands an entirely new approach. Rather than looking for signs of human behavior, we'll need systems that verify agent legitimacy, authorization scope, and decision-making logic.

This shift raises critical questions for fraud prevention across banks (Chase, Barclays), card networks (Visa, Mastercard), and payment processors (Stripe, PayPal). For instance, how do you establish a chain of trust when an agent purchases on behalf of a user? How do you verify that an agent hasn't been compromised or hijacked? These challenges require fundamentally rethinking our approach to transaction security and fraud prevention in an agent-driven ecosystem.

Fraud resolution in the era of AI agents

Future payment systems could introduce 'agent wallets' with granular spending controls, such as $100 limits for trusted merchants like Amazon and stricter caps for lesser-known websites. These wallets would integrate real-time fraud detection, submitting cryptographic evidence for disputes and maintaining transparent, auditable records of agent actions tied to human authorization.

Visa could introduce an agent-specific flag to the existing payment protocols, indicating this payment was initiated autonomously, along with a trial of reasoning and actions leading to this payment. Meanwhile, Stripe might expand its SDKs to enforce programmable payment rules, ensuring alignment with user-delegated instructions (Stripe has already made its foray into Agentic payments with its recent [SDK release](https://stripe.dev/blog/adding-payments-to-your-agentic-workflows)).

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8OjO!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F51162bd5-52fd-4d16-858a-e4ff07409f1e_1320x850.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8OjO!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F51162bd5-52fd-4d16-858a-e4ff07409f1e_1320x850.png)

Stripe’s new [Agents SDK](https://docs.stripe.com/agents) supports Vercel’s AI SDK, LangChain, and CrewAI

Beyond preventing fraud, agentic payments face fundamental economic and infrastructural challenges. The existing payment infrastructure wasn't architected for the high-frequency, low-latency transactions that characterize agent interactions. Consider the standard pricing model of payment processors like Stripe: a 2.9% fee plus 30¢ per transaction. While manageable for traditional e-commerce, this fee structure becomes prohibitively expensive when scaled to the myriad micro-transactions that agents might need to execute.

This pricing isn't arbitrary—it reflects the complex web of stakeholders in the traditional payment chain. Card networks like Visa and issuers like Chase have built their business models around these transaction fees. Interestingly, Stripe's recent acquisition of [Bridge](https://www.bridge.xyz/), a stablecoin payment infrastructure provider, hints at a potential solution. By leveraging blockchain-based payment rails, companies could facilitate agent-to-agent transactions without incurring the expensive overhead of traditional payment networks. This move suggests a growing recognition that the future of payments may require completely new infrastructure, optimized for the unique demands of autonomous agents.

Consider how a new payment protocol might work in practice. An "Agent Payment Protocol" (APP) could include:

* **Delegation Chain Verification** - a cryptographic proof chain showing the agent's authorization to make specific types of purchases
* **Transaction Context Object** **-** machine-readable metadata including:

  + Reasoning trail that led to the purchase decision
  + Reference to specific user preferences/rules that were satisfied
  + Confidence score for the decision
* **Smart spending controls** with programmable constraints like:

  + Category-specific limits (e.g., $200 for groceries, $50 for entertainment)
  + Merchant-specific trust scores
  + Required human confirmation above certain thresholds

Major payment providers could implement this through extensions to existing standards. For instance, Visa's existing 3D Secure protocol could add an agent verification layer, while Stripe's API could introduce new parameters for agent-specific transaction metadata.

While payment infrastructure provides the foundation for agent-driven commerce, the very nature of how we complete transactions must also evolve. The familiar checkout process—a hallmark of e-commerce for decades—is about to undergo its own transformation.

## **Redefined checkout experience**

In an agent-first environment, the concept of a traditional checkout—where a human user confirms their purchase by clicking a “Buy” button—fades into the background. Instead, agents operate with predefined goals and parameters, continuously evaluating whether a proposed transaction aligns with those objectives. Rather than halting everything at a payment prompt, agents could integrate a “stop and reflect” step into their workflows. For example, if a user’s agent is tasked with booking a flight seat that’s both a window seat and close to an exit, the agent pauses before completing the reservation. It double-checks that the seat assignment matches the user’s criteria and only then proceeds, ensuring flawless execution of the user’s intent and mitigating the probability of the agent going off the rails due to hallucinations.

Stripe perfected its checkout experience with its Optimized Checkout Suite, which dynamically shows customers the most relevant payment methods using machine learning, leading to a 10.5% increase in revenue

This reflective process transforms the final authorization into a subtle verification loop rather than a jarring user interruption. The agent reviews the selected attributes—price, seat location, baggage allowance, and cancellation policy—and compares them against the user’s stored preferences and constraints. It confirms not only that the requested outcome has been met but also that it falls within acceptable spending limits and trust parameters. This transforms purchasing from a manual “Are you sure?” prompt into a nuanced, data-driven decision matrix.

As these agent-mediated transactions proliferate, payment providers and merchants might offer additional layers of context-a
