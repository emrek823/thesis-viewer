## Executive Summary

Solstice executed one of the most dramatic pivots in the Virtue portfolio: from medical record retrieval for community oncology ($0 ARR at pivot, March 2024) to biopharma content commercialization ($2.3M ARR in 4 months by January 2026). The founders had zero prior biopharma experience and zero pre-existing relationships, yet signed top-10 pharma customers through pure hustle and a 100x better value proposition (minutes vs. months for content creation). The January 2026 Series A ($15M target to reach $15M ARR) hinges on two existential questions: (1) can they expand within accounts, and (2) can they productize enough to avoid becoming an agency.

---

## Key Feedback

### 1. The $15M math does not work on expansion alone.

The Q4 email claims "We believe we can hit our goal of $15M ARR by year's end even if we stopped external sales." This is not credible. The AstraZeneca whale is explicitly a 2027 opportunity ($5M+ for 2027 per the email). Sanofi cannot 10x in one year due to annual budget cycles. Realistic expansion yields $5-6M; the remaining $9-10M requires 10-15 new logos. The deck should say this explicitly.

### 2. Stop leaning into amateur status.

The team slide undercuts the company with "10000x ideas that haven't worked" and "no professional experience." Jesse Lee from Minds & Assembly brings pharma agency credibility. Phathom replaced their Agency of Record (MRM/Omnicom) with Solstice. Alexion expanded from $25K to $350K in one quarter (14x). Lead with these wins, not weaknesses.

### 3. The best proof points are not in the deck.

| Proof Point | Significance | Recommendation |
|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| Phathom dropped AOR (MRM/Omnicom) for Solstice | Proves productization, not just services | Add as case study slide |
| Alexion $25K pilot to $350K contract | 14x expansion in one quarter | Add to GTM/traction slide |
| AstraZeneca potential $5M+ whale | Path to scale | Name explicitly (2027 timeline) |
| Sanofi 3 contracts across brands | Multi-brand expansion proof | Add to expansion narrative |

### 4. Align on contracts before going out on raise.

ARR, CARR, recognized revenue, and timing must be crystal clear and consistent across historical, current, and forward-looking statements. The Q4 email shows $1.44M actual ARR vs. $2.32M contracted ARR vs. $2.3M in deck. Investors will probe this.

### 5. Kill the "Your Bet" slide or reframe it.

The slide raises investor doubts at the worst possible moment. "Can we expand? Can we productize?" leaves open questions right before the ask. Reframe as "What We've Proven / What We'll Prove" and move it earlier, or address these concerns in GTM and Team slides instead.

### 6. Head of Sales remains the critical open hire.

The role has been discussed since September 2024 (Greg Lewis mentioned in November 2025 notes), but remains unfilled. Founder-led sales cannot scale to 15+ new logos. This is a gating factor for the $15M ARR target and should be addressed in the deck's hiring plan.

### 7. The agency risk is real but manageable.

At 1 engagement lead per 5 clients today, the model is inherently labor-intensive. The deck's defensibility slide (data flywheel at brand + company level) addresses this conceptually, but needs proof points. What percentage of current ARR is platform-delivered vs. engagement-lead-delivered? The productization roadmap should show the path to 1:10+ clients per engagement lead.

### 8. The pivot was the right call.

The medical records business showed insufficient willingness-to-pay. By March 2024, after 18 months of iteration and visits to 20+ community practices, the founders concluded that $6-7 figure contracts from community oncology were not achievable. The pivot to biopharma commercialization leveraged the same core competency (AI for healthcare content) but targeted a market with dramatically higher willingness-to-pay ($12B content TAM).

## Open Questions

### Business Model & Productization
1. What percentage of current $2.3M ARR is platform-delivered vs. engagement-lead-delivered?
2. What's the path to 1 engagement lead per 10+ clients? What specific features need to be productized?
3. What are gross margins today? What's the split between LLM costs vs. human delivery costs?
4. The deck says "Using Solstice is faster + easier than emailing an agency" - is this true today, or is that the future state?

### Expansion & Land-Expand
5. What's the actual conversion rate from 1-brand customer to multi-brand?
6. Sanofi is at 3 brands with 41 brand potential. What's the realistic timeline to capture more?
7. How many expansion targets have 2026 budget authority vs. requiring 2027 planning?
8. AstraZeneca whale: what's the gating factor to $5M+? Is this really 2027, not 2026?

### Sales & Pipeline
9. Has Greg Lewis (or anyone) been hired as Head of Sales?
10. What's the new logo pipeline beyond current customers? Takeda and Pfizer mentioned - what stage?
11. What's the realistic sales cycle for a $500K+ ACV deal? How many can close in 2026?
12. Are there contingency agencies or other interim sales solutions being used?

### Financial
13. With $1.2M cash and Jan 12 kickoff, what's the backup plan if raise takes 6+ months?
14. What drove the 5.8x burn increase from $26K to $150K monthly?
15. What's the projected burn at $15M raise fully deployed?

### Competitive
16. Real Chemistry does $665M ARR. What would it take for them to build this? Are they trying?
17. Veeva is mentioned as "distracted by Salesforce battle." What if they enter this space?
18. EVERSANA launched 90% MLR automation in April 2025 - have you seen them compete?

## Bottom Line

### What's Working

1. **Pivot Decisiveness:** Killed medical records cleanly, went all-in on biopharma content. No half-measures.

2. **Sales Velocity:** $0 to $2.3M ARR in 4 months with zero prior pharma relationships and founder-led sales. This is exceptional.

3. **ICP Clarity:** Mid-cap pharma, 1-10 drugs, brand marketing directors with budget control. The $300-600K ACV wedge is well-defined.

4. **Managed Service Wedge:** Smart to not force behavior change upfront. Pharma marketers want to talk to humans; Solstice recreates the white-glove experience.

5. **Competitive Timing:** Agencies face innovator's dilemma (can't disrupt their own business model). AI makes 100x improvement possible now. $236B patent cliff creates urgency.

6. **Product Sophistication:** Pre-MLR tool + Auto-annotations + Content Generation is genuinely differentiated. The agent approach (vs. prompting) shows continued technical iteration.

### What Needs Sharpening

1. **$15M Math:** The expansion-only narrative is not credible. Be explicit: "$5-6M expansion + $9-10M from 10-15 new logos."

2. **Head of Sales:** Critical hire still open. Founder-led sales has limits. This is the gating constraint.

3. **Productization Path:** Clear articulation of how platform replaces engagement leads over time. What's the automation roadmap?

4. **Expansion Proof Points:** Need concrete data on multi-brand conversion rates and timelines. Sanofi 3-to-41 is a claim; show the motion.

5. **Margin Visibility:** Need to understand services vs. platform contribution. What percentage is human-delivered?

6. **Runway Tightness:** $1.2M cash, $150K burn, 8 months runway. The raise must close quickly. What's the backup plan?

7. **Team Slide Positioning:** Stop leading with "no professional experience" and "10000x ideas that haven't worked." Lead with Jesse Lee's pharma agency credibility, the $2.3M in 4 months execution, and the Phathom AOR replacement.

### Bull Case

Solstice becomes the "Canva for biopharma content." Every brand team at every pharma company uses Solstice to create compliant content in minutes. Land-and-expand works (Sanofi goes 3-to-41 brands), ACVs grow to $1M+, and pharma consolidates content spend on Solstice as agencies decline. The data flywheel compounds (learning taste at brand level + aggregating performance data at company level). Real Chemistry or Veeva cannot respond quickly due to innovator's dilemma and tech debt. Solstice reaches $15M ARR by EOY 2026 and is either a standalone challenger with 60%+ gross margins or an acquisition target for New Mountain/Thoreau's $30B health-tech consolidation play to complete the MLR stack. $100M+ exit within 3 years.

### Bear Case

The managed service model does not scale. Engagement leads become a bottleneck. Gross margins compress as human delivery costs grow faster than revenue. Expansion is slower than expected (brand teams are siloed, champions leave, budget cycles gate expansion to 2027). The AstraZeneca whale slips to 2028. Head of Sales hire drags. Real Chemistry responds by acquiring an MLR technology competitor or building in-house. Veeva launches aggressive AI features in PromoMats. $15M ARR becomes $8M ARR and the company is a well-capitalized agency, not a platform. Exit options narrow to acqui-hire or down-round.
