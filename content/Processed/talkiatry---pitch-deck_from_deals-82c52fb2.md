# We have clinically validated our model.

### Study Details

*   **Participants:** 1,800+ patients
*   5 appointments over 15 weeks
*   **Significance:** Highly significant (p < 0.0001)
*   **Very large effect size:** (Cohen's d of 1.23 – 1.30)

### Treatment Outcomes

| Outcome                        | Anxiety | Depression | Description                                         |

| Have a reduction in symptoms(4) | 79%     | 77%        | Patients showing improvement in symptoms            |
| Have no clinically significant symptoms | 67%     | 62%        | Patients achieving symptom remission                |
| In clinical remission          | 26%     | 29%        | Patients in full clinical remission                 |

### Peer Reviewed Clinical Results³

**Depression Severity Score (PHQ 8)**

*   **X-axis:** Score (0 - 22, from Minimal to Severe)
*   **Y-axis:** Patients (0 - 150)
*   **Data Trend:** A significant shift in patient distribution towards lower severity scores after treatment. The peak of patients shifts from around score 8 (Before treatment) to around score 3 (After treatment), with a notable reduction in patients with scores 8 and above.

**Anxiety Severity Score (GAD 7)**

*   **X-axis:** Score (0 - 20, from Minimal to Severe)
*   **Y-axis:** Patients (0 - 150)
*   **Data Trend:** Similar to depression, a clear shift in patient distribution towards lower anxiety severity scores after treatment. The peak of patients shifts from around score 8 (Before treatment) to around score 3 (After treatment), showing a reduction in patients with higher anxiety scores.

## Slide 9: Clear Path to >$1.5B in Revenue and >$425M in EBITDA
INVESTOR PRESENTATION | WINTER 2024

# We have a clear path to >$1.5B in revenue and >$425M in EBITDA with significant upside.

We produce savings of $8,400 per member per year. Taking 35% of the savings would result in $190M of additional revenue and 75% gross margins. Using 2028 estimates this would result in 2028 producing **$2.7B in revenue and 20x growth.**

**104% CAGR** (2021A-2028E)

*   Psychiatry leads to LTV magic as their patients are referred to our other services.
*   Each therapy patient represents a 76% increase in patient LTV an ~10% lift in patient adherence to care (retention).
*   Savings leads to CAC magic as insurers are incentivized to send Talkiatry their members.
*   Each IOP patient is an additional $16k in LTV.

# We make money when an insurance member chooses to receive care from us. Most patients pay <$30 per visit and the insurer pays the rest.

### We have an LTV:CAC of 5.5x on the demand side
