### Background and Experience

- Previously at Tractable: Applied ML focused on CV for damage detection on vehicles
- Built text-to-SQL pipeline for data insights
- At Scale: Worked with healthcare initiatives, including largest pharma companies
- Currently at OpenAI: Working with healthcare customers

### Healthcare Industry Adoption Patterns

#### Pharma Adoption

- Eli Lilly example: Triple mandate for GenAI chatbots
	- Requirements: High quality, safety, 6-week deployment
	- Challenge with compliance team vs digital product team priorities
	- Initial deployment: Limited chatbot with predetermined responses
- Solutions developed:
	- Regulatory guideline compliance
	- AEPC detection workflow
	- FDA reporting handling
	- Clinical copilot for document writing

#### Provider Adoption

- Strong adoption in clinical scribes
- Revenue cycle management showing promise
	- SmartDX example: 72-hour implementation timeframe
	- Focus on non-clinical use cases initially
	- Strong ROI pitch for hospitals

#### Payer Adoption

- Notably slower adoption rate
- Contributing factors:
	- V28 transition challenges
	- Extended sales cycles
	- Complex buying process

### AI Model Capabilities and Limitations

#### Current Capabilities

- Strong performance in health code extraction
- Models can directly process medical documents and output health codes
- Improving clinical knowledge through Project Vita

#### Limitations and Challenges

- Utilization Management challenges:
	- Two-step problem structure
	- Guideline selection particularly difficult
	- Inter-clinician disagreement on guideline selection
- OpenAI stance:
	- Will not pursue entire healthcare workflows
	- Focus on improving model’s medical knowledge
	- Avoiding regulatory complexity

### Data Processing and Infrastructure

- Upstream data processing crucial for downstream inference
- Engineering-heavy system setup benefits:
	- Criteria extraction from guidelines
	- DSL mapping with AND/OR logic
- Importance of data normalization and patient record filing
- RPA potential for guideline management and updates
