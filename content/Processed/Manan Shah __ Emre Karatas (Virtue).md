### Background & Company Evolution

- Manan Shah: Stanford math/computer science degrees, first engineer at Kumo
	- Built graph machine learning models for enterprise data warehouses
	- Worked with DoorDash, Reddit, Coinbase on GNN-based approaches
- Left Kumo 5.5 months ago to build new company
	- Started with model post-training, evolved to enterprise workflow automation
	- Embedded with private practices, physician groups, billing teams for 2+ months
	- Girlfriend is doctor, her father runs private practice - direct exposure to admin inefficiencies

### Healthcare RCM Market Assessment

- Administrative space dominated by unstructured data agents
	- Prior auth, referrals, call center automation as common wedges
	- Legacy providers tech-enabling services and rebranding as “AI-first”
	- Point solution fatigue among customers despite technical capabilities for full platforms
- Current market crowded but opportunities remain
	- SmartDX example: hyper-specific CDI wedge (pre-bill second pass review only)
	- 18 months of physician data scientist labeling created defensible moat
	- Many competitors forced into narrow specialties due to non-extensible platforms
- Timing considerations
	- Models now so good that SmartDX engineer “would never start this business today”
	- Existing companies at high valuations unlikely to rebuild tech stacks
	- Consolidation/bundling opportunities emerging

### Platform Vision & Market Opportunity

- Healthcare has two distinct flows
	- Clinical decision making (monopolized by EMR)
	- Administrative workflows (not monopolized, fragmented across systems)
- Current admin reality: billing teams use payer portals, clinical records, phone calls, Excel
- Vision: autonomous platform as system of record and action for admin workflows
	- Full front/mid/back cycle integration required
	- Proactive approach vs reactive cost competition
	- Can disintermediate offshore RCM industry completely
- 8-10 year timeline to fully disintermediate services spend through technology

### Next Steps

- Meet in person in San Francisco Monday-Wednesday next week
	- Manan in Sonoma for VC retreat, will coordinate location
	- Both excited about aligned vision and complementary perspectives
