### Business Opportunity & Vision

- Real differentiation is speed to market - whoever gets there first at lower cost basis wins
- Focus on accelerating Phase II/III clinical trials
- Goal: Run trials in significantly shorter time at half the cost basis
- Would reduce barriers to entry enabling more clinical trials to be run
- Genmab can only harvest limited value internally - opportunity to open capabilities to broader market
- Need to establish interoperability with multiple companies/systems
- Will require marketing and selling machine

### OpenAI Partnership Status

- Meeting with OpenAI every other day to firm up discussions
- Have engaged with OpenAI COO Brad directly
- Current OpenAI team structure:
	- Forward deployed engineers
	- Executives with limited healthcare knowledge
	- Actively hiring for healthcare expertise
- OpenAI still determining their healthcare/pharma strategy
- Genmab appears to be first serious engagement in pharma space

### Potential Structure & Precedents

- Datavant cited as successful precedent
	- Currently generating $300M in EBITDA
	- Creative ownership structure with Roivant
- Two potential paths:
	- Go to market with Genmab IP independently
	- Partner with OpenAI (preferred option)
- Need to consider:
	- How to keep Genmab name separate
	- Structure to allow other pharma companies to participate
	- Ownership and incentive structures

### Next Steps

- Genmab to clarify OpenAI’s intentions regarding market approach
- Further discussions needed on structure once OpenAI direction is confirmed
- Emre to share:
	- Datavant materials and startup structure examples
	- FDA Sentinel RFI information
- Potential follow-up brainstorming session when timing is right
