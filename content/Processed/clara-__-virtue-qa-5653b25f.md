# Virtue <> Clara Q&A

## High-level

### 1. What do you optimize for initially - supply vs. demand - to solve the cold-start problem and why? We touched on this in the call but would love to dive deeper here.

We'll be starting on the demand side, building senior-care specific payroll and employment software, expanding quickly into the care management vertical with consumer-oriented features to position ourselves as a full-service care management platform rather than a pure-play payroll provider.

Starting on the demand side provides significant benefits that will position us well as we expand into a two-sided marketplace. It will build strong, sticky, recurring revenue, and allow us to seed our supply base organically, prior to launching our marketplace. Consumer customers will onboard their own (presumably high-quality) care workers.

Secondarily we have reason to believe supply acquisition will be less challenging than expected. An estimated 50% of our >50 waitlist signups are care workers seeking employment. This is consistent with what we learned from Care.com insiders who shared that they have almost never run large-scale, paid, supply-side acquisition campaigns, and have acquired their supply mostly organically through halo effects from consumer acquisition marketing spend.

### 2. We'll get into this more below with each side of the marketplace but with your and lan's experience, can you talk about how you think about LTV/CAC for both sides of the marketplace in tandem? We're thinking of components like average time a care provider is on platform (stay for multiple years for multiple consumers) vs. consumer (potentially shorter term needs), # of consumers vs. providers on platform, how "idle" providers might be on the platform, etc. How does this evolve over time?

*   **Consumer:**
    *   HHS estimates that around 69% of the U.S. population will require long term care services in their lives for an average of about three years
    *   Consumer care needs often evolve over time - can start w/ part-time "a few hrs/day" and extend into full-time care before patient moves to facility
    *   Assuming the avg need for a consumer paying for services is ~40hrs/week (splitting diff between part-time and 24/7 extremes)
        *   40hrs/week, $25/hr, 50 weeks/year, 3 years = $150k in "GBs"
        *   Clara take = 10%, LTV = ~$15k/consumer
            *   Note: will be reduced somewhat by user churn
*   **Provider**

We plan to monetize the supply side in 2 ways, although even at scale we don't anticipate the supply side generating a substantial amount of revenue

1.  **Marketplace listing fee of $10-$20/month:** The fee's primary purpose is as a supply quality control mechanism, not a revenue driver. It will help filter out unserious candidates, and ensure those who are listed on our marketplace are motivated to engage with the platform, decreasing response times when matched with potential care recipients, etc. This listing fee is a tactic we've borrowed from similar child care marketplaces, one of whose co-founders spoke highly of the $30/month fee they charge for marketplace access, for the benefits listed above (fewer low-quality applicants, better response rates, etc.).
2.  **Ads/Affiliate marketing:** A second/third wave revenue stream, post PMF and marketplace expansion. We plan to leverage the data we collect on care workers to offer them targeted ads/affiliate links for products/services that are uniquely valuable for this demographic (think everything from ongoing educational courses to high-yield savings accounts, to PPE)

### Back of envelope math on care worker LTV

*   Avg. tenure on platform (including in as employee) ~ 1 year (We anticipate a median of < 1 year, but a long-tail of high-quality care workers pulling avg. up.)
    *   Note: This projection is extremely hard to measure. We don't believe agency retention figures are a good comparison. Convos w/ Care.com insiders have told us retention is not an issue on the supply side
*   Within 1 year lifespan we can expect the avg. care worker to seek opportunities between 1 and 2 times
    *   Again, the best matches may last more than a year, but the average experience will likely be shorter
*   Won't project revenue from affiliate marketing/ads yet. Too speculative
*   LTV = 1.5 months of listing fees x ~$15/month = $22.5

## Consumer Demand

### 1. Let's walk through the 3 options consumers have today (agency 60%, pay off-the-books 25%, pay on the books 15%). Why do those 3 groups switch to Clara (particularly those who hire an agency and pay off-the-books)?

First point: 80% of consumers we've spoken to have tried both agency and non-agency solutions, so switching is already an engrained habit. We have an opportunity to present ourselves as the best solution on the market each time a dissatisfied customer is in the switching mindset.

Breaking these groups down:

#### 1. Agency - The argument for switching for agency customers comes back to our core value props:

a. **More affordable.** Average hourly cost to the family should go from $30/hr to $23-$25/hr, including taxes & service fees, a 20% discount that will save the avg. family (utilizing 40hrs of care/week, 50 weeks/year) $10k annually
b. **More control:** Hiring independently provides families certainty and control over who is providing care.

Consumer research participants primarily complained about agency's inconsistent care quality, high costs, personnel management and administrative dysfunction. A few verbatims:
*   "Spoke to a few agencies. Problem with agencies is they couldn't promise they would have the same person there everyday. The plus side is that they would substitute, but I knew it would make my mom anxious to have someone new everyday, and wanted to protect my mom's dignity."
*   "[Agency] had done a crappy job... [and was] really expensive for the level of return we were getting on the care...I feel that the middleman is taking advantage of both sides"
*   "The reason why we picked $25/hr is because she was being paid $12/hr and the agency was taking the rest. We said we'd give her what we'd pay the agency and you can keep all of it"
*   "You get what you get. One time they sent over a pregnant woman who was asking [the patient] to help her pick things off the ground...not an appropriate situation"

#### 2. Pay off-the-books

There are 3 reasons why a family may be employing a care worker and paying off the books currently. We believe our platform solves 2/3. Reasons people go off-book:

1.  **Worker is not legally allowed to work in the U.S.**
    a. Not much we can do for this group (unclear how large)
2.  **Paying cash is easier** - Folks in this group may have started the process of trying to set up a payroll system but abandoned the effort due to too much friction. That friction can come either from the employer onboarding process itself, or from resistance from the careworker. Our platform will address both:
    a. **Reduce consumer onboarding friction**
        i. Best-in-class UX. Never look at a tax form/PDF. No need to communicate with a government agency, no docusigns, etc.
        ii. No need to onboard your employee manually. We take care of that
        iii. Workers comp insurance provided OOTB at no extra charge. Competitors refer customers to 3rd party insurance brokers, a non-starter for most consumers
        iv. Senior-care specific UX to guide users through the process
    b. **Lower employee resistance**
        i. Easy employee onboarding - similar to employer onboarding, never look at a tax form, simple, intuitive flow w/ minimal friction
        ii. Earned wage access (EWA) aka on-demand pay - allowing employees to access 50% of earned wages next day. Solving for the "immediacy of cash"
        iii. Emphasizing the value of unemployment insurance coverage, having employment history and pay stubs to reference for things like credit applications, etc.
3.  **Don't want to pay taxes (save ~12%)**
    Folks in this group will frankly be harder to reach and convince, but there are strong arguments for paying on the books that we can push through ads/sponsored educational content etc.
    1.  **Liability protection** - on the job injuries in home care are 44% higher than US average. Homeowners/renters insurance will not cover an uninsured/unregistered worker's injuries
    2.  **Avoiding costly tax penalties** - Paying cash makes employers and employees vulnerable to charges of felony tax evasion or tax fraud. Even if you avoid criminal charges, you could be liable for failure-to-file and failure-to-pay penalties that could double the outstanding tax balance, plus interest. And there's no statute of limitations for tax fraud, so if you're audited 30 years later when applying for social security or medicare, you could be liable for 30 years of interest payments, on top of the outstanding tax balance, plus penalties. That really sucks.
    3.  **Eligibility for tax breaks** - Families can save up to $6k/year by taking advantage of deductions and utilizing instruments like FSAs to pay domestic employees. These strategies are only available for on-the-books employees

#### 3. Pay on-the-books

Convincing folk already paying on the books to switch payroll providers will be challenging during our MVP phase, and we don't expect to spend much time/effort/$ on this bucket until we have developed our care management platform. Once we have established ourselves as more than just a payroll provider, we can use this wedge to convert folks using an alternative payroll service, as we'll be offering a full-service management platform for a price that's competitive with their existing payroll + insurance costs.

### 2. What are you solving for initially (ease, control, affordability, quality, all of the above) to get consumers to sign up? You touch on all of these in the materials but as an example - is the 55-75 affluent female choosing Clara for 20-40% cost-savings to work with you guys initially before you have a brand that signals quality and reliability?

We want our brand to be synonymous with quality and ease. We believe this is the key to winning the allegiance of our initial customer segment. The 55-75 y.o affluent female is likely choosing to hire independently because they prioritize control and care quality above all else. In many cases they've been burned by agency shenanigans by this point, and are looking for an alternative. While seekers of value, they're less price-motivated than future user personas we will pursue. The 20-40% cost savings of hiring independently through Clara is icing on the cake.

**Consumer Research Verbatims re: financial consideration**

*   "If we're looking ten years from now it will be a [bigger issue]...because right now it's >$100k/year"
*   "They [financial considerations] haven't been central, though my stepfather constantly remarks on how much it's costing"
*   "I was looking for value for the dollar but didn't lose sleep over it."

### 3. LTV/CAC

*   **CAC. What was driving initial assumptions to budget higher CAC (you mentioned $200-$300+ in call) and why have you seen low CAC ($15) with experiments today? How do you see this evolving over time?**

The initial $300 CAC estimate was based on an exploration of Google keyword competitiveness that projected CPC of ~$15 for the key payroll keywords/phrases we wanted to target for MVP.

#### MVP Payroll Consumer Acquisition Budgeting & Performance Forecast - Google

| Metric                        | Value        |
| :---------------------------- | :----------- |
| Estimated monthly searches    | 15,000.00    |
| Estimated avg. CPC            | $15.86       |
| Daily budget                  | $250         |
| Monthly ad budget             | $7,604       |
| Payroll Clicks/month          | 479.46       |
| Expected CVR                  | 5%           |
| CAC                           | $317.20      |
| Payroll signups/month         | 23.97        |
| Payroll rev/user/month        | $150.00      |
| Payroll rev/month total       | $3,595.92    |
| LTV                           | $1,500.00    |
| LTV/CAC                       | 4.73 months  |

Our initial marketing campaign utilizing Google's auto-targeting model is bringing in clicks much more cheaply than anticipated. However, while we're loving seeing the low CPC in our initial campaign, we don't expect our waitlist CAC to hold in the $10-$15 range post-launch. There are two concerns:

1.  A waitlist sign-up is much easier to collect than a full "purchase". On-site CVR is likely to dip once we launch
2.  It's difficult to ascertain how well our current ads are capturing high-intent users, but early indications are that sign-ups are at least 50% supply-side job-seekers

This campaign may indicate that our initial estimates were overly pessimistic, but we'd rather be cautious and overdeliver than the opposite.

*   **LTV. How do you think about the LTV of a consumer initially with payroll and care management platforms? How does this evolve over time (e.g., affiliate marketplace)?**

From the start, we are anchoring our pricing to the alternative of an agency rather than a payroll provider. This is an attempt to ensure potential customers think of us in the context of their broader care expenditures, rather than as a standalone expense.

We anticipate starting with a take-rate in the 2.5-5% range (offering introductory discounts of 50-75% off sticker price). This will put our pricing roughly in line with competitive payroll providers who take ~$1000/year.

*   MVP payroll: 2.5% - 5%: $1250-$2500/year
*   Payroll + care management: 5-10%: $2500 - $5k/year
*   Payroll + care management + marketplace: 10+%

## Care Provider Supply

### 1. How do you qualify, attract, and retain the highest quality care providers?

We will capture the supply side effectively by leveraging our MVP payroll supply network, and responding to their three most pressing pain points.

**Acquisition**
*   Seed marketplace with individual care workers provided via consumer side (100s)
*   Leverage these key initial care workers w/ generous referral programs, taking advantage of the fact that care pro communities are tight-knit, and highly reference-based. (This is the way most agencies find their supply)
*   Take advantage of the consumer acq. halo effects (~50% of our >50 waitlist signups and introductory calls scheduled are care workers seeking employment)
*   Find workers where they are already congregating through partnerships with training centers/schools and care worker advocacy groups (Ex: https://www.cnaonlinecourse.com/find-a-cna-job (Online CNA training course recommending graduates using generic job sites like https://jooble.org/))

If we are still struggling to build supply in initial target markets after exhausting the above, we will consider looking for bulk supply acquisition opportunities via existing sourcing agencies

**Retention**
We'll retain better than agencies by addressing care workers key needs/pain points

1.  **Better pay, on their terms:** Independent hires can make 30% + more than agency pay. That's a game changer for care workers, and often sufficient incentive to pry high-quality care workers from positions with agencies/facilities into independent relationships. Earned wage access will help these care workers get access to funds immediately.
2.  **Control of schedule:** Home care workers, especially the good ones, are predominantly female (87%), and "older" (median age 46). Many are often juggling family responsibilities alongside professional ones. Agencies do not offer the flexibility of a marketplace-based platform like Clara
3.  **Confidence in finding their "next" opportunity:** Building in supplier features prior to marketplace launch like "open to new opportunities" toggle allowing us to begin providing matches at a small scale, and helping workers build confidence in Clara as an effective job discovery platform
4.  **Phase 3+: community features** - access to trainings/career dev opportunities: We believe that societally it's essential for us to transform care work from an undesirable job into a fulfilling long-term career. Once at scale we believe we can help retain workers on our platform while also upskilling them and generating revenue by offering things like partnerships with certification programs/nursing schools etc.

### 2. How do you define "quality" for care providers?

We will measure and enforce quality in 4 ways:

1.  **Basic, foundational vetting:** Comprehensive background checks + ID verification for all workers
2.  **Duration of relationship:** We will assume a positive correlation between duration of care worker <> family relationship and quality, and score the worker higher as a result
3.  **Inferred reliability metrics:** Is the care worker arriving and leaving the home when expected? Are they regularly providing updates to family members, etc.
4.  **Explicit sanity checks:** Double-blind ratings/reviews/explicit feedback solicited from families and providers

After speaking with Sr. Directors of Care.com's safety and product marketing teams (both ex-Uber), we believe our care management platform will be a unique unlock for acquiring high-quality workers and maintaining a high quality bar overall. Both expressed major frustration at Care.com's lack of visibility into the quality/outcome of matches post-match. Our care management offering will discourage disintermediation, and provide those high-quality signals of downstream performance and satisfaction that we can feedback into user profiles, quality scoring algorithms, and use to provide higher quality matches.

### 3. Can you elaborate more on acquisition on the care provider side? For example, how are you thinking about acquisition channels, CAC, building density in a region, or some creative strategies you mentioned (halo effect, having consumers bring their provider on, etc)?

See answer to Care Provider Supply question 1. "How do you qualify, attract, and retain the highest quality care providers?"

### 4. How does compensation for the care providers change when they work with Clara? For example, let's say a HHA is seeing 5-10 patients per month and 1-2 of those patients switch to Clara. How would this work in practice? Will they have to leave their agency and spend a few months ramping up to 40+ hours per week?

a. From our research, HHAs mostly don't see more than 1-3 patients at a time. And from the patient side, they prefer to have fewer HHAs with deeper relationships. This is true even for patients who need round-the-clock care.

So, what would this would look like in practice is that an HHA has 2 patients, one moves onto Clara and says "hey, come work for us 20 hours per week". Then the caregiver would use Clara to find 1 more patient and be back to full time. We see something similar in customer conversations often. For example, a loved one falls and breaks their hip. They end up in rehab. The family likes the caregiver at the rehab facility and asks them to come on full time at home.

### 5. How do you think about the distribution of gross wage / care provider? Are there any "whales" like we see on other marketplaces (e.g., for Outschool 20% of teachers drive 80% of revenue)? How does this inform how you build the supply side?

a. There is likely not a "whale" effect in this marketplace. Our revenue is basically tied to hours worked x wage. Both of these are capped - even with overtime a caregiver can only work a certain number of hours per week, and even if wages vary by geography or similar, the high end will be within 2-3x the low end. So we don't expect to see one family or one caregiver driving 100x revenue compared to the mean.
b. As we build supply we can focus more on the quality and reliability of the care worker, because their value generating potential is capped.
c. This dynamic puts less pressure on the demand side, because we don't need 100 consumers to satisfy the appetite of our highest-value suppliers. ~One high-quality match/year is sufficient

## Commercial / GTM

### 1. Can you talk more tactically about what a rollout would look like in a specific geography (Miami, LA, NYC, etc)? Essentially providing more detail on the "come for the tool, stay for the network" approach you describe in the 1-pager marketing & GTM strategy section.

We will experiment with our city-by-city marketplace rollout playbook over time. At this point we expect it to look something like this:

1.  Roll-out payroll solution
2.  Spend to acquire ~100-200 payroll customers w/ their own care worker supply
3.  Begin taking the care workers that respond to consumer advertising (via halo effect) and onboarding them into a holding pattern (w/o listing fee)
4.  Allow existing care workers to signal in-app they're open to new work opportunities
5.  Open the consumer side of marketplace in limited fashion
    a. consumer-facing discovery marketplace landing page + signup form
    b. consultation calls
    c. manual matching on backend → actively balancing supply/demand & building tech enablement tools as necessary
6.  Lean into supply and demand side network effects w/ referral programs to accelerate growth on both sides of marketplace until we have hundreds of care workers actively seeking jobs in the city
7.  Fully unlock marketplace in city. Automate matching process, synthesize learnings and move on to next city.

### 2. How do you think about expanding to non-medical home care services and all home health services over time? What is the trigger (marketplace size/scale?) or product innovation (expansion of care management platform?) that gives you the right to win in these areas?

Customer needs will be our trigger for this expansion. When we reach the scale where we're consistently seeing families churn off the platform because their loved ones have deteriorated and require a higher level of care - from a CNA, RN, or similar - we'll know that we can start onboarding those folks on the supply side and that the demand will be there.

We believe we'll be well positioned to expand into these areas because a lot of our underlying tech is highly translatable to needs in other areas. For example processing Medicaid payments to independent care workers through programs like CDPAP in NY, or integrating updates from visiting physical therapists into the care management portal. With families already happily using Clara for non-medical home care management, we will be their preferred solution for additional service expansion.

## Product

### 1. What is your approach to building product in healthcare? Does the best product win in this space? As I was sharing on the call and happy to share more tomorrow, we have seen the value of founders leveraging a "product/engineering mindset" to rethink known issues in healthcare (HHA/CNA turnover, quality, and supply has long been a problem) with creative approaches (haven't seen D2C payroll approach before). The most sophisticated AI/ML approach or de-novo build isn't always necessary out of the gate!

We're approaching building product in healthcare with humility. While we both have strong backgrounds building consumer tech, neither of us are experts in the nuances of the US healthcare system.

Fortunately, our go-to-market strategy allow us to lean into those strengths. By starting with a healthcare-adjacent product, payroll, and then expanding into marketplace (where we do have some background from Uber) and care management, we can build our expertise over time. By the time we're talking about expanding into Medicaid eligibility or RN staffing, we'll have built more knowledge and hired folks with the relevant background

1.  We believe that building really high quality product is necessary, but not sufficient, for succeeding in consumer health tech. The primary opportunity for innovation is in navigating the massive, complex, and ever-shifting structure of the American healthcare system and simplifying it for consumers.

People feel friction every time they come in contact with the healthcare system, from day 0 finding care to day 300 paying for it. It's about understanding which of those technology can help smooth over while capturing some value along the way.

### 2. What is required to launch Clara Pay and consumer payroll experience by Q2?

a. **Time** - dev will take another 8 weeks or so (can be accelerated if Ian stopped getting distracted w/ fundraising)
b. **Money** - >$50k in SaaS fees to launch in prod w/ full MVP feature set
c. **Identify and recruit pilot users from waitlist**
    i. Today we're seeing a solid rate of signups, split across what we perceive to be consumers and aspiring care workers

## Financials/Milestones

### 1. What are 2-3 things you have to prove by the end of this year?

If considering only calendar year 2024, we will be focusing on establishing strong PMF and growth trajectory for payroll product + laying foundation for care management

1.  Prove Payroll PMF - strong anecdotal feedback (CSAT). retention and willingness to pay amongst pilot cohorts
    a. "That we can get the payroll product in front of consumers right as they've found someone to hire and are figuring out the right tools/steps to do so"
2.  Payroll GTM dynamics. Can we keep CAC/LTV ratios and payback periods within target bounds
    a. CAC low <$500/user
    b. Retention high - >80% MoM
    c. MRR high - >$100/month
3.  Firmly establishing demand for care management + collecting & processing initial data and signals (location tracking, etc.) necessary to roll out highest-value care management features in Q4-Q1 '25

See the Appendix for a table view of how we're thinking about milestones and KRs for the next year.

### 2. Let's dive into more of the thinking behind your assumptions for the financial model to understand and quantify your thinking. Focusing solely on outputs can be a bit of false precision for pre-seed companies! In particular:

a. **1) increase in average price per unit for payroll/care mgmt**
    i. Introduction of higher-value care management features allowing us to reduce discounts to new users
    ii. Introductory discounts expiring for aging cohorts of loyal customers (mix shifting from new to retained customers).
b. **2) retention % driving retained units for payroll / care mgmt**
    i. Benchmarking on high-quality B2B SaaS of 80-90% MoM. This is expecting consumers to be reticent to switch payroll providers once established due to high switchings costs etc.
c. **3) timing of new units for care professional listing fee**
    i. Won't be exploring marketplace until '25
    ii. First few months of single-digit fees will be XPs in intro markets, testing behavior of suppliers paying fee vs. those offered listing access for free
