### Market Context & Competitive Positioning

- Market dynamics shifting from accepting drug cost increases to demanding mitigation solutions
- RightWise uniquely connects PBM performance to premium rates - something nobody has done before
- Carriers using drug costs as primary justification for rate hikes, creating market demand for cost certainty
- Big three PBMs historically protected but now facing scrutiny over fiduciary aspects
- Increased PBM switching (past 2 years > previous 5-10 years combined) creates opportunities
	- Stop loss providers lose visibility when disconnected from PBM
	- RightWise gains unique data advantage through 100M+ claims across 15 PBMs

### Product Portfolio & Market Segmentation

- Gross vs. Net pricing model
	- Spec capacity unlimited, agg capacity limited to 6x premium written
	- Carriers petrified of agg risk due to limited capacity
- Market breakdown by group size:
	- Sub-250 members: Essential/Optimal subscription products
	- 250-1,000 members: RxProtect (ASO carve-out business)
	- 1,000-5,000 members: PMPM guarantees (self-insured groups seeking laser/trend mitigation)
	- 5,000+ members: PBM Protect (direct PBM contracts)

### Subscription Product Development

- Expanded coverage to specialty drugs through two approaches:
	- Narrow formulary or transfer liability to carrier partner
	- Drugs costing >$60k or >$80k on gross basis
- Optimal product versions:
	- Closed: Compressed formulary where permutations never cross selected deductible
	- Open: Full coverage with carrier retaining pharmacy spec, RightWise covers expected upfront
- First Responders group: 1,000 members, functions as PBM replacement with higher ARR

### Business Performance Metrics

- Current ARR approaching $2M (October annualized)
- Additional $4-5M onboarding for January 1st (includes closed-won business)
- Quote rate: 90-95% (industry average: 1.5-2%)
- Bind rate: 20-25% from quoted
- Renewal rate: 100% currently (industry average: 40-50%)
- Loss ratios running sub-10% across all products

### Loss Ratio Analysis & Underwriting Strategy

- Initial conservatism in underwriting approach proving effective
- Areas of over-conservatism identified:
	- Partial PBM data access (channel vs. NDC-level rebates)
	- 20% credibility discount applied when data doesn’t flow to pill level
	- Overly conservative trend forecasting with additional corridors
- Future refinements planned:
	- More competitive rates possible
	- Spec vs. agg liability optimization - pharmacy lacks significant spec liability but premium overweights it
	- Improved decrementing based on actual results
	- PBM-specific trend and corridor differentiation

### Major Pipeline Opportunity: Mayo Clinic

- Lucy RX (formerly IPM) bidding on 170,000 Mayo Clinic lives through Aluma Health acquisition
- RightWise providing PMPM guarantee to help Lucy win the deal
- Deal structure: $19.6M revenue across 3 years ($4M year one)
- Decision expected within 10-14 days
- Additional opportunities with Lucy RX:
	- Second 190,000-life state health plan
	- Enterprise-wide deal for their full 3M+ lives (post-acquisitions)
	- Strategic value beyond single deal

### Technology Platform & Distribution

- Mavrx software platform serving as two-sided marketplace
- PBM partners using platform for improved underwriting capabilities
- 16 PBMs onboarded with 15 more in pipeline
- SaaS pricing: $100-150k license offset by PMPM consumption model
- Full data integration providing competitive advantage in underwriting
- Market Edge product for brokers launching in 2-4 weeks
	- Data normalization and analytics
	- Benchmarking against 100M+ claim database
	- Audit and prospecting tools
	- Live monitoring dashboard for renewals

### Team & Operations Update
