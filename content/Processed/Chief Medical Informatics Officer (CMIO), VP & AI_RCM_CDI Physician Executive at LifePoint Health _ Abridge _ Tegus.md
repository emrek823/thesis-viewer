while before Healthcare systems are actually customers.

Q: Please briefly speak to the use cases and pain points that this new product from Abridge will help your health system with.
A: Can discuss its scope and market potential in depth

Client
Thanks for taking the call. I'm researching healthcare and AI. Just to get started, to confirm, are you a customer of Abridge and are you using their prior auth product?

Expert
Customer of Abridge. Nobody other than two healthcare payers are using the news that came out last week. Nobody's using that on a commercial level yet.

Client
Very interesting. Why are there only two customers right now?

Expert
Allegheny and Highmark are, to me, your payers. You need to A) Be in those markets where those are two payers on the other end of a prior auth and they're also cozy with Abridge given that they're both Pittsburgh-based and that's where they're based.

To me, there's a lot of PR here. There's a lot of smoke. There's not a lot of substance at this point in especially how you look at how this product is going to impact clinical workflows. To, me it sounds really nice. You dig into the details and you say, "Okay, this is not where prior auth is in the moment. This is later on where prior auth is going to be making an impact." Can I explain what I mean there?

Client
Yeah, would love to just hear in as much detail as possible what, why you think this is just press?

Expert
Sure. We heard two weeks ago Epic's got their own scribe now. That really takes a big piece of this market and everybody's got a big question mark now. Oracle Cerner went through with a big, "Hey, here's what their AI version is going to look like end of last week." Again, another "If we lean into the EHRs, maybe we save ourselves some money and maybe we get a little bit more features."

There's a lot of noise right now in the scribing world. Everybody's picked up big investments. Everybody's got these hollow valuations. Now, it's, like, "Okay, what else are we throw against the wall?" No longer is it just scribing that people care about. You've seen this. The message a year ago was, "Let's give providers back quality of life. Let's get them in their home at 5:00 P.M." That message is completely gone now. Now, we're looking at how can athese code, how can these be CDI tools and how can they impact RCM? There's so many of them out there. They all need to try to find another lane of differentiation.

Client
It's all marketing right now for the most part. Why did they choose prior auth and what they're specifically doing not where prior auth is today?

Expert
Sure. Prior auth is the door opener or door closer for all of behavior. This is just a normal thing. Prior auth is a complicated process. Every payer has a different interpretation of how prior auths are done. We could have

the best tech on our side of the house, but if payer X has a different way for us to fax in an order, maybe call in a prior auth, there is a lot of inconsistency about how prior auth is done. Mostly because not all the payers are aligned on how they want to receive prior auth and then give approvals. To me, that's the big problem with prior auth.

We can have all the great tech on the provider side, but the payers have to be willing to open up those channels and allow that process to have real-time prior approval, which everybody wants but few can get today. To me, it's a little bit of a deterrent on the payer side to say, "Hey, we're going to restrict this flowing of giving everybody services. We're going to slow it down a little bit." I'm not a conspiracy person, but that's where prior auths always feel like it gets held up a little bit.

Abridge is trying to solve this. There are other vendors. There's vendors like AKASA. There are vendors like Thoughtful AI. There's a lot of vendors that have prior auth, but they're mostly RCM vendors who help you with patient accounting, help you with checking benefits, helping you check if you have a deductible or not. You tie everything in into a front cycle RCM kind of vendor that's out there today. Prior auths are being solved by others.

Abridge's take on this would be, "Let's impact the provider who's creating a potential use case for a prior auth. I work up a patient. I think they're a good candidate for an MRI and I need to make sure I check the right boxes of information that helps facilitate that prior auth going out the door." It sounds great and it will be in a couple of years, but right now, providers will have very little to do with prior authorizations.

Providers are clinical. They're the experts in clinical. They don't know business. They don't know the RCM side of this. They're leaning into somebody else to facilitate that for them. This locks them into being part of the prior auth process which, in a way, basically, they become the interpreter of the information that has to be on the prior auth. What is the diagnosis code? What is the CPT code that justifies us sending this to payer X?

It's not every payer plays the same way in prior auth. To me, this is going to feel like it's going to hit in some markets, it's going to miss in many others based upon the payer landscape with that healthcare system of who they do business with.

Client
Basically, if I play that back, it's that the prior auth rules are so complex because of the diversity of payer rules and specifications that Abridge may be able to create this checkbox for some percentage of the questions they need to ask to be able to not have the back and forth of prior auth. It won't be able to just from the scribing information, be able to accurately capture all that information. It's going to help, but it's not going to transform the prior auth process. Is that fair?

Expert
Spot on. It is a good adjunct tool to help support the ease of a prior auth getting through, because oftentimes, you say, "Hey, my nurse is going to come in. They're going to get you set up for an MRI." They either know that provider really well when they say they're going to order an MRI for X, they know what kind of codes that go along. This will assist the process. This will assist the specificity of, "Hey, we need to be more precise with our coding because you can't just do a general code and expect the payer to approve it the first time." This will support the process.

This will not be the transformative, this is what everybody uses for prior auth. It's just not intended to be that way because their tool is being used by those who sit in the administrative revenue side of the house. It's a clinical tool right now. You've got to figure out, clinical users, they don't drive prior auth process. They might have the information needed to facilitate it, but that's it. They are not the facilitators of checking to Highmark gives an approval to then go and schedule that patient for that procedure or that diagnostic. That's where this gets a little bit murky.

Client
For prior auth to be effectively automated by AI, it has to sit with the revenue team that understands the nuance of this billing?

Expert
Spot on. You're going to have providers who never did anything business related, never want to understand financials and hate the payer mix that they deal with. You're asking them to get more involved in a process when, really, they are the clinical experts and those around them or the technology that supports them is the pieces that should be doing this best for them.

Client
Okay. I want to bookmark that. I want to come back to it. Real quick, have you met any of the prior auth specific start-ups like Plenful or Latent Health or Mandolin?

Expert
Know them well and you could throw in with Tandem as well. To me, these play really nice in the pharmacy space. These are really pharmacy driver tools. These are tools that you need to get prior auth for infusion, specialty drugs, if you are a 340B healthcare system. To me, those are mostly locked in the easier side of the house, which would be the pharmaceutical side of getting a payer to approve a drug. That's where they still sit, those vendors.

Client
That makes sense. From our understanding, there is a spectrum of companies like Anterior that are doing medical prior auths over to companies like Plenful and Latent doing pharmacy prior auth, but that they're starting to converge the middle and offer both. That's our understanding today.

Expert
I think we're trending in that direction. Listen, if you can do pharmacy RCM and prior auths, you're absolutely going to be able to dabble in the payer mix. To me, that's a no brainer. Two years ago, AKASA was the big one trying to do prior auths. Now I see some of the big RCM vendors that are trying to pull this off. It makes sense. If you can do one, in theory, you've got a halfway start to be able to do the others.

No matter how great your tech is, you need the payers to play along. To me, that's the squeaky wheel here, is the payers and the variability of all the payers need to jump on board. That's the hold up here, not that the technology couldn't support some of this.

Client
Just to play devil's advocate on that point, you could argue that many of the prior auth expenses come from the fact that there's errors on the provider side. If you can cut out those, you can cut out some meaningful percentage of the labor that goes into prior auth. If you can also automate the appeal process, then you can automate another meaningful chunk of the prior auth admin spend. Does that resonate with you?

Expert
That is fair. What ends up happening would be a provider that is in a specialty has a repeatable process all day long. If you're due for a colonoscopy, here is a diagnostic that has to support that code and it's a blanket that just keeps happening time and time again. This payer requires this code along with this diagnosis to get this approved. This information is relatively well oiled. You have a lot of automation here of what you need for these approvals.

Yes, there will be a pickup of more specificity, more accuracy when we send these in so we minimize those denials. It isn't this groundbreaking information that's not already mostly available today. We're just adding a little bit more specificity on top of that, again, will be a benefit. Will not, all of a sudden, distort what a true RCM prior auth vendor is already doing.

Client
That makes sense to me. Now that we've touched on both the prior auth-specific start-ups and Abridge, I want to talk about the synergy between prior auth and scribing work. Ultimately, what I'm trying to figure out is are the prior auth start-ups going to be standalone companies or does Abridge have an advantage by

being integrated into clinical workflows that they can then expand to RCM workflows? Just to start, do you have initial reactions on the advantage that Abridge has if they expanded to a full prior auth automation platform by having the clinical information from scribing?

Expert
The easy answer on the surface would be yes, but I want to point out the holes in that yes that I made. The holes would be if you aren't an Epic customer, then you have no business with Abridge. That, to me, is a problem. The second problem would be because they're not on other EHRs. If you're not potentially using Epic patient accounting or maybe Epic from an RCM or an RCM vendor that's friendly with Epic, i.e. Ensemble, you've got the clinical information, great.

The clinical EHR and the financial aspects for patient accounting within EHR are oftentimes separate. When you're separate, that lessens how impactful the clinical nature of this is. Oftentimes, when you're scheduling a patient for this, these happen upstream before that clinical encounter even takes place, or it's looking at a record from six months ago that supports the, "Why are we ordering this today?" All that is happening on the financial/accounting side to facilitate that approval, which then gets you scheduled.

That, to me, is what makes this a little bit more difficult of yes, it's helpful that you have the clinical backing, but so much happens outside of the clinical chart to facilitate this. Scheduling, patient accounting, deductibles, all of that has to be thought about. Yet, you've got this clinical where everything backs into at the end of it.

Client
That makes sense to me. You're essentially saying it's a data and integration problem, that Abridge is so tied to Epic that if you're not in the Epic ecosystem, then the value is going to be limited?

Expert
100% %. It feels like I'm knocking Abridge. I am not. They've got the war chest. They've got everything going for them if you're an Epic customer. 55% of the healthcare system is not Epic and you have no help to them. That, to me, is the problem here. With the news that Epic's digging into their space more and more, Epic's got Hello World that can do a lot of things, that can unlock some of these efficiencies.

This is what I feel like the other vendors that are out there have thought. "Hey, there's a lot of opportunity to exist," because they focus so on one EHR that only has 45%, which is a ton, but there's a ton else out there to go and get and be successful with.

Client
Okay. I just want to take a second to summarize. Abridge does have an advantage in prior auth from having access to clinical information, but because of their alignment with Epic, it makes it much harder to automate the prior auth process for most providers that aren't using mostly Epic focus.

To tie that into the opportunity for prior auth-specific start-ups, would the right strategy then for them to go and integrate with all of the tools that aren't Epic and say, "Look, maybe we aren't going to get into the Epic ecosystem, but we can go and automate all the processes for all of the other providers, and by doing that, also avoid Abridge competitively?

Expert
100%. I will tell you one other piece. A lot of Epic customers exist today that are only on the acute side. You dig a little deeper and you say, "Tell me what you're using in the ambulatory outpatient space for EHRs," and you'll hear athena. You'll hear Veradigm. You'll hear ECW. You'll hear a lot of these either specialty EHRs or generic EHRs.

You'd say, "Why would they do that?" You're saving money. Yes, it makes a little bit more complication of having an outpatient EHR that's different than your inpatient. The EHRs like to do another enough that we pull it off today. We are athena in the outpatient space and then we have eight different EHRs we support on the inpatient side. Complicated? 100%. Does it work? Yes. There is a lot of business to even go from those

who have Epic and go, "Yeah, you've got an acute space. Here's how we can solve everything in your outpatient space and still enter into Epic waters," let's say.

Client
That makes sense to me. Like I said, we're evaluating prior auth-specific start-ups as part of this research. Would you invest in these companies if you could? The Latents, the Plenfuls?

Expert
I would. I like Plenful in particular. I think, to me, the diversity of the solution, those that may be needed from inventory management, those that need it for reporting, those that need it for maybe understanding the supply chain aspect of this is very valuable. Market by market, care setting by care setting, there's a lot of variability and to be able to harmonize some of that where there's big dollars. I say this. We're not a 340B, but that's another compelling use case where you could start thinking about how these tools are really valuable.

I would, because I think, to me, you've already shown success in the pharmacy RCM space. To me, it's a natural progression of how you could help on the prior auth within the medical side because it's going to be the same DNA, even if it's a different person on the receiving end of how that's going to be responded to. I would.

Client
What would you estimate? We'll say the average and the maximum contract size that a company like Plenful or Latent could command from the market.

Expert
It's broad because I feel like, to me, it's going to be an à la carte menu. You're going to need some of those services, maybe not all. If you are an infusion-heavy kind of healthcare system or an outpatient ambulatory surgery system, you're probably going to have more utilization today because that's where the bread and butter. I think, to me, you're looking at are they going to distort the big RCM vendors out there? No. Are they going to replace the R1s or Ensembles? No. Couldn't they be a bit player to help some of those processes and then corner the market in outpatient infusions, injection centers, all of those? Yes.

I'm trying to think how to answer that with numbers. You're probably seven figures base, maybe high six, low seven to above into eight figures if you're really using them and you have a broad need with either 340B programs or heavy into infusion, which there's a big dollar value. There's a lot of need and very much complex. This is a big, big number is what I'm trying to say, because of the need that this space can solve for.

Client
Okay. There's an opportunity to command $10+ million contracts here. That's very interesting. I have two questions. The first, you mentioned infusion-heavy ambulatory clinics. How large is that customer set? Is that measured in the hundreds? Is it measured in the single-digit thousands? Is it in the tens of thousands? I'm trying to get a broad sense of market sizing here.

Expert
For infusion, just to put some things around what infusion means, infusion could be dialysis. It could be just you're here for serial injections. You could be here for things with orthopedic or things with rheumatology. These are not just one and done, which makes it even more compelling. Once these patients are involved, you're having serial types of infusions and injections ongoing, IV antibiotics. There's a ton of need here.

Once a patient, they stay a patient, which helps this model for them. I put this in, probably, business customers that are out there. You're probably in, I'm going to say, the 600-800 that are candidates here. Now, again, some of them are very big. Some of them are standalone single sites. Some of them could be just a lot of niche vendors if you start talking about all the different types of injectables that you use. I don't see this space getting smaller at all.

We talk openly about we made a few decisions a couple of years ago in the post-acute space and now, you see we're in fusion centers. You're seeing the push towards things going to ASC where you keep patients out of hospitals and yet do everything you possibly can. This is a very strong market space because you're trying to get patients, keep them from the hospital, and yet, more and more services are needed. This is a prime space. I'm very bullish on infusion areas.

Client
Okay. That's super valuable. It also answered my second question, which was going to be on the details of why these are so high-impact solutions.

Expert
Injectables, the infusions, these are high, high dollar things that come with significant scrutiny. There is a real precise table of what justifies A) Getting approved. B) Recertifying to continue use based upon certain success metrics and the data and the reporting that these types of tools can offer to substantiate why you should continue to be in a 340B program.

Why you should continue to offer these services with the scrutiny that comes from these because they're high dollars is what you're paying for them to cover you to continue to support these services and expand because pharmaceuticals have better services than ever before. They just come with a cost and, therefore, enhanced scrutiny.

Client
That makes sense to me. I'm curious. If you were looking at evaluating start-ups like Latent and Plenful, what would the questions you would want to be answered before you'd feel confident investing? The big question, abstracting all of those is trying to figure out are these going to be standalone companies? Can they compete against Epic and Abridge and the various start-ups here, or are they ultimately going to be acquired and integrated into a larger platform?

Expert
I think to me, they play enough in the unique RCM space, I think a big, big RCM vendor could look at, "Hey, if we bought Plenful, if we bought Latent and added them to to round out our infusion, our pharmaceutical RCM, the scrutiny there," that, to me, could be a play. Could the R1s, could the Ensembles, could the Waystars come in and say, "Hey, this can really help expand our base?" I think to me, that's where the attraction would lie.

The Abridges of the world, no. If I was Latent, I wouldn't see enough from what I'm getting from them to make a big deal for me. I'd want to link to more of a financial driver rather than a clinical driver because so much happens financially in patient accounting that's distinct from a clinical scribing tool that it could help clinical workflows, but this process is relatively solid in sitting outside of the provider workflow for us to generate prior auths and generate RCM modalities.

That, to me, is where this is a distortion of how the market really fits with what Abridge is trying to do. I get it, but we're far from that actually being able to stick and actually be how clinical is going to impact some of this stuff on the very much upstream process side of this.

Client
It's super helpful. The other small part of that question, are there any other questions you would want to ask Latent or Plenful before investing?

Expert
I want to know, "What are you integrating with? What else do you got? What other type of platforms are you doing good integration with? Is it strictly a patient accounting tool?" I know they all come with certain EHR kind of modalities. "What is your integration into the EHR looking like? If a provider never used Abridge in their life and still had documentation in the EHR, what are you taking from the EHR that is needed?"

To second that, even if you are using Abridge, at the end of the day, all I need is integration into the EHR, because what I'm looking is the output from the EHR, whether I use Abridge, whether I use Nuance, whether I use Navala or Commure, at the end of it, the EHR is the source of truth. How I get there, I'm indifferent to. All these tools offer coding today.

Even adequate EHRs without any scribing tool give me some level of diagnostics or procedural codes that I can take from. I don't care what scribe vendor you have. I care what EHR you're on. That is where I think, to me, you're going to have to continue to show themselves up. If you've got a lot of EHRs, that is a good, good sign of how, whatever scribing tool you use, I got your EHR integration because the note still has to end up in the EHR.

Client
Got you. It's the breadth of integrations.

Expert
The features as well.

Client
Okay. The subpoint here would be a very strong technical team. Because of this complexity, to actually automate this work, you're going to just need to have a very strong technical team to be able to build this out?

Expert
I'm going to need good people who can interact with payers. To me, at the end of this, every payer might have a little bit of a unique spin about how they're doing prior auths. Sure, some have the same portals. Sure, some have the same receiving end of this, but there's enough variability there where you said it best. I need good engineering and good technicians who can say, "Optum here, Blue Cross here." Yes, it's the same theme of how it uses there, but it might be some variability. That's a key piece of how these products can differentiate themselves.

Client
Well, thank you again for your time today. This was very helpful. Bye.
