### LDV Partners Overview

- Currently focused on AI-related deals, both infrastructure and applications
- Qing’s background: MD by training, previously ran clinical trials
- Experience with Deep6 investment in 2016 in clinical trial tech space

### Clinical Trial Technology Discussion

- Deep6 case study: Good idea but slow adoption due to EMR integration requirements
- Discussion of competitors:
	- TriNetX: Widget behind EMR approach
	- Reify: One of many tools sites adopt
	- Florence: Described as “slightly better SharePoint”
- Idea Biosciences deal mentioned: $150k for one trial
- Pricing model discussion: Value-based vs per-patient recruitment fees
	- Potential for 7-figure contracts with larger CROs
	- Example: Icon deal worth $30M for 150 potential studies per year

### Global Market Opportunities

- Untapped markets identified:
	- Middle East
	- Latin America (Dominican Republic mentioned)
	- Japan: Unique population for rare diseases but faces cultural/language barriers
- Opportunity to unlock less sophisticated sites that need more handholding
- Value in building global network beyond mature markets like Australia

### Key Risks & Considerations

- Need to balance customization with scalability
- Importance of maintaining site connectivity while serving sponsors/CROs
