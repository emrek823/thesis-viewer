Deep-dive questions for Virtue VC

6/26/22

Gaming + Behavioral Tailwinds

What are the non-obvious tailwind(s) and/or market dislocation(s) that suggest that there is a meaningful market opportunity to address at the intersection of gaming and behavioral?

I did a deeper dive on tailwinds for gaming + GenZ mental health in the trends section here

Since launching 4 months ago, Grown to a community of over 800 members and facilitated over 350 sessions with 62 weekly paying "journeyers"

Since launching 3.5 months ago, we’ve grown to a community of over 530 members, 6 clinicians, and have facilitated over 200 sessions

Most of the mental health space has been focused on serving primarily high-socioeconomic, educated, and urban elite demographics because that’s the population that has traditionally been able to pay out of pocket for therapy. It’s also reflected in the therapist population, which is 76% middle-aged white women who primarily serve middle-aged white women. Most behavioral health companies still target these demographics because that’s where there are biggest spend buckets, but there is incredible opportunity to provide care for people of other age ranges, ethnic backgrounds, and SES – we just need business models that can support each of those groups. There are substitutes to therapy in each of those groups that demonstrate a willingness to pay for mental health support. In a recent survey, GenZ respondents said that they’d be willing to pay on avg up to $150/mo on mental health (but not as much for other healthcare expenditures).

For example, for GenZ, there is a precedent of care-seeking on social media platforms. Mental health videos on social media are getting billions of views. On TikTok alone, the hashtag #BPD (borderline personality disorder) has 3.7 billion views, #bipolar 2 billion, and #DID (dissociative identity disorder) another 1.5 billion. They are needing support but can’t access it due to the cost structure of 1x1 support and even when they do get care, there’s a generational disconnect in terms of how they would like to receive the support.

We are innovating a new clinical model + business model to engage young people in the care they need, in new ways that are more compelling to them; generationally-competent care for a digital-first population. By also anchoring on community and group support, we can shift the unit economics of the cost model to be more appealing to a generation that is comfortable connecting openly around these topics. We know that GenZ and Millennials are more open than any other previous generation about their mental health needs and we also know that the majority of them use gaming platforms to destress and connect with friends.

GenZ spends a significant portion of their leisure and connection time in virtual spaces, like video games, which have become the new defacto social networks for many. There are approx 180M gamers in the US (2.5B worldwide). 29M monthly active US players on Minecraft (170M monthly active globally), 200M monthly in Roblox globally and 350M monthly players in Fortnite globally. As people are more comfortable delivering services inside of these gaming environments, most of our social services will also need some form of integration into these virtual spaces. Furthermore, several surveys have shown that generationally there is a proclivity towards more authentic expression and association in gaming spaces, compared to IRL.

What do you believe are the key immediate and long-term growth drivers behind this growth of this intersection?

I think of it less as an intersection (meaning both need to be true to demonstrate significant growth) but rather an overlap in two prominent growth trends that are leading to a significant opportunity. Mental health for young adults is at its worst and is continuing to worsen at an alarming rate. Gaming and metaverse communities are becoming the de facto social fabric of the internet. Openness to pay for digital assets in these spaces will also lead to a proliferation of new service and product models that will sit atop these platforms.

Immediate growth drivers:

Access to gaming platforms are more open, free to play, etc and numbers of monthly active members are staggering (see above)

Social engagement online has progressively moved towards games as a more directly engaging way to connect with others, and with that, a move of most service models/products into the metaverse

Covid

Exacerbated already bad mental health crisis

Gaming spend increased during lockdowns as people were bored and lonely

Destigmatization of mental health in GenZ

Long-term

More authenticity in virtual identities than IRL

More specialization and contextualization of mental health support, as well as innovations in “front door” access to services

Patients want care on their own terms → this is the next iteration of telemedicine, embedded in communities

Virtual platforms will be the primary engagement spaces, not brick-and-mortar

Loneliness and need for new social modalities of connection; we need new social fabric for engaging in community and belonging

Building Community

High-level, what is most important to you as it relates to building the Hero Journey community? And, how will you know that a thriving, scalable community has been created (metrics, anecdotal evidence, etc.)? Think of this as a ''product-community fit' enquiry.

Deep, deep love and commitment from the community is the most important factor that we are optimizing for. This is tremendously hard to measure but generally we want to see:

High engagement with the community (sharing, posting, inviting, attending community events, hosting events  – raw volume and also % of members who engage)

A trusted community where people can go to share their lives and feel belonging/connection (vulnerability, openness, authenticity in posts and in conversations)

A small but growing and extremely loyal group of people for whom we are their primary community. % of people for whom we are one of their primary space for engagement in discord (for example, most people are part of tens or hundreds of communities but make us the place they engage daily)

A sense of ownership of the community (hosting events, taking care of the space, upholding norms, making suggestions for improvement)

We measure this anecdotally through our interactions with them every day but it also shows up as NPS, reviews they share on our behalf, and the love in the discord channels every day. Check out #testimonals channel in discord, the reviews on Facebook, or look at our messages of support here.

Who are the ideal members of the Hero Journey community today and in the future (age, demographics, socioeconomics, diagnosed vs. undiagnosed, etc)?

Current:

Age: 13-55, with most users in their 20s-30s

Demographic: spread across the US, but surprisingly high portion in the midwest and south

SES: working class, in school, etc

Mental health history: half diagnosed with mental illness and working with therapist/psychiatrist already, half seeking support for the first time (blend of anxiety, depression, loneliness, cPTSD, neurodivergence, queer identity)

Lots of queer, neurodivergence, BIPOC, and rural folks → least served communities

Ideal today:

Mild/moderate anxiety, depression or loneliness

Medium acuity but stable, with existing mental health support from therapist/psychiatrist for med management

New people looking to onboard into mental health through a community-support model for accountability and psychoeducation

Ideal future:

Range of community members across age, SES, geography, and identities (including elusive white/asian male gamers) → community-based support model for each lived experience

Move to younger populations and provide family-based support modalities → big unmet need

2 paths ahead:

Move subclinical to support broader base of population, or laterally to extend current model to other populations/communities

Move full clinical and provide full stack of support for SMI and range of acuity

What is the breakdown of members that are finding you via the website and interacting with Intercom bot vs. finding you through other Discord channels vs Twitch vs other? What is the timeline/frequency of interaction for the onboarding experience after they sign-up?

Almost all of our members find us through the website. About half engage with us through Intercom and half join without any prior engagement. Anecdotally about half of people join immediately after finding us and then another half save us for later and interact slowly or do their research over a few weeks.

We haven’t done discord, twitch, or influencer marketing yet but are planning to pilot that soon. Also going to partner with other mental health discords and IG influencers in Minecraft.

We onboard new members within 1-2 days of sign up when possible and then we try to place them in a group within the week. This has been harder recently as the volume has increased so much. We check in after their first session to make sure it’s a good fit, answer any questions, etc.

How are you defining LTV for the initial customer group you are acquiring through gamer specific paid ads? Can you elaborate on strategy as you evolve to proprietary channels?

LTV and CAC are both calculated on members who have paid for at least one session. Brian to send updated numbers for LTV calculation with retention cohorts over time.

Proprietary channels

Maximize paid social

Paid ad spend on IG/FB towards expanded targeted, experimenting with marketing materials

Sponsored content with discord communities, twitch/IG/G2 gamer influencers for mental health support

Free gamerfied psychoeducation

Content marketing through minecraft, psychoeducation, and videos

Virtual channels

Gaming partnerships with publishers to:

Be a preferred provider of mental health support to combat toxicity and provide a safe environment for support (Fortnite, Minecraft, Roblox)

Provide advertising for mental health services in their communities, billboards in games, cross-target audiences

Maximize longevity of game for each generation of releases

Incentives in game for participating in program (points, badges, skins, etc)

Gamer mental health communities, nonprofits, etc to fill excess capacity in exchange for marketing

Gamer conferences and online event portals, including sponsoring gaming tournaments

IRL

Partnerships with PCP clinics, therapy clinics, etc for referrals (both ways) and overflow support for their waitlists (can work out revenue share)

Employer-focused family benefits platforms (Cleo, Manatee, Brightline)

Schools, local governments, boys and girls clubs for online support and shepherding

Publications with academic institutions towards public health adoption

Organic growth and referral loops in community

Virtual swag and digital assets to support HJC (i.e inside of games like Fortnite, etc)

How do you define and measure success with your “go-to-community” strategy (as opposed to typical GTM funnel with awareness, engagement, conversion/sales, etc)?

We see it more as a flywheel but we use the same general phases of acquisition for the services. The community is our way of driving engagement and brand loyalty with our services, so that folks who are ready and able to subscribe also have a bunch of people from whom they can derive implicit trust.

Top of funnel engagement with brand: awareness, engagement, conversion, activation

Community engagement: activation, engagement, retention, conversion

How do you think about the balance between “value creation” (creating the trust/relationship/gravity that draws in community members) and “value capture” (converting to paid customers/users), particularly as you scale?

Value creation:

This was a really tricky balance for us at the beginning because there are a lot of people in our community who would love to access our services but are unable to for many reasons. We decided early on to focus on the core service model as our main flywheel and use the community as a growth engine for our core business model until we have a more effective way of monetizing the community (Subscription for membership, peer quests, etc).

We focus our community on developing a sense of connection and also sharing stories of healing/support (particularly led by our Mental Health Advocates, who are graduate students in counseling programs)

For our most engaged community members, we reward them with public and private acknowledgement, and we offer up open slots in sessions as they arise (a few have converted when they get the chance)

Value capture:

Our core model is focused on conversion to Journeys specifically, so this is already our main goal. Admittedly we’re super early and haven’t focused enough on converting the community into paid journeyers yet but our work in hosting events, making people feel comfortable opening up, etc has been the most effective path to conversion.

Moving forward, we’re going to host more events and do informal advertising to convert into the journey sessions, including sharing “fomo” artifacts from the sessions

We’ll also start exploring memberships for the community when we are beyond a certain size, so that we can focus our energy on providing deeper support in the text channels for folks who need it.

We convert at the top level of the marketing funnel and re-engage every couple months with folks who have been in our community.

What is the approach to community moderation to allow genuine speech and relationships while protecting community members from trolling / bullying?

We have a very low threshold for trolling or bullying, particularly since we are a mental health community with minors. We do a pretty good job of catching the trolls. The biggest concerns come up with oversharing of stories/experiences from the community that could be triggering to others. We keep an eye and heavily enforce tone tags and trigger-warning blocks.

We have a couple moderators who keep an eye out for trolls etc and have a really vigilant group of journeys for whom we are their primarily community. The text channel moderation is done by MHAs who are therapy students who know how to deescalate shares, respond with affirmation/psychoeducation, and redirect unhealthy conversations.

One of our core community values is to help each other spiral upwards, and to so so, we set the tone really early for the community and modeled how to share in a constructive, meaningful, and authentic way.

User / Gaming Experience

You discussed 20% week 1 engagement on discord being average and HJC having 32%, but what other key metrics do you think about? When you have data from your most recent campaign, can you share more on overall utilization across different activities / groups? What percent of the interactions are related to mental health / loneliness (distraction tactics, neurodivergence, positive affirmations) vs. general community (gaming clips, art, music, etc)?

Most of our metrics are around engagement, retention, clinical impact, and love of the program

Here is our cohort retention for various timespans

I should note that there are private groups for each crew that are not publicly viewable, which is where the majority of sharing happens for our journeyers.

In terms of the community discord, here are the most commonly used channels. Most of the engagement is in daily check-ins, positive affirmations, venting, etc or gaming channels. Most people come to us for mental health support

Can you elaborate on the experience for the 50% that are not in same game (vs. the other 50% on Minecraft)? How does the clinician interaction or member experience differ?

The main focus of the sessions is the counseling itself. We keep the group capped at 5 people so that there’s enough time to have everyone share and get support. We usually start with a round of intros (anonymously), a quick check in question, and then we pick a theme to discuss as a group. The therapist facilitated the session by going around the room and having each person share if they’d like to. They will introduce worksheets and tools based on CBT/DBT techniques and other evidence-based modalities to give members a tangible area to work on. And then we close out with a specific commitment or reflection on the topic.

While that session is happening, we’re usually gaming together behind the scenes but most people use the game to keep occupied while they listen in to the session (it can sometimes be awkward to not do anything while others are talking). We’ll pick a mission/goal to do at the beginning and just play while the session happens. Everything in our Minecraft realm has been built by the community so there are always a ton of cool projects happening that need help. In upcoming programs, we’re also working on designing game environments specifically for therapeutic modalities.

For the people in Minecraft, they’re usually all building their own things anyway but can be collaborating on projects for the community. Occasionally we’ll also have sessions inside of specific spaces in the game that have been built for the journeys but it’s not that common (and mostly teenagers request this)

The other folks are all playing their own game or they’re gaming together in a game like Stardew Valley, Fortnite, Garctic phone, etc. Others are just there to connect and share with the people in their crew, doing homework, making art, etc.

The clinician interaction is the same in all cases: it’s primarily through discord audio and they share worksheets in the private crew channels. In some cases when the group is new or younger, we’ll do more engagement in the game and use game scenarios to trigger conversation topics for reflection.

Can you elaborate more on the frequency and makeup of the peer quests? Are these as structured as the journey sessions or driven by the community of peers?

Peer quests (or general community events) happen 3-7 times per week. They are less structured than journey sessions and we’ve been experimenting with a bunch of different versions. We’ve taken our priority off of this because we are already so swamped with the clinical journey sessions, but we have the community and moderators run events to keep folks engaged between sessions.

We have community events like:

Gaming and hangout events by the community, across a myriad of different games (5-20 people)

Art making night (10ish people)

Movie streaming night (lots of demand but can’t due to copyright)

Weekly check-ins twice per week - high engagement (20-40 people each time)

Tabletop sessions for dungeons and dragons

Future “pick up” peer quests will be structured with a simple check-in, norm setting, and question picking model. We are going to build a bot for people to pull questions from, picking random questions from a set of their choosing https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KtO80LJrG_GOU9HvQefQ_59MV-8I0z3P/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=107116578315172584397&rtpof=true&sd=true

What others activities or options are members asking for that don’t exist today?

We’re pretty open to letting our community try out whatever they would like to, so we iterate new events/activities every week

Things that have been requested and are on our list

Insurance coverage

1x1 psychotherapy

Art therapy

More gaming options (java, fortnite, etc)

Sobriety/parent groups

Queer and trans groups

Text-only groups (for socially anxious people)

Mini-games within other games

Clinical + Engagement Model

Can you share any data on the PHQ-9 / GAD-7 scores you are collecting at intake or after sessions?

Brian to compile and send initial findings here, for the intake psychographic assessments, post-session questionnaire results, and battery followup

We are doing the second PHQ-9/GAD-7 questionnaire now, since the literature suggests querying quarterly. We’re also going to adapt a shorter version for more frequent surveying.

How do you develop and implement worksheets and tools for different modalities (CBT, DBT, ABT, etc) for each session? For example, is this standardized throughout or up to the discretion of a clinician?

So far it’s been up to the discretion of the clinicians because we wanted the community to pull together the topics that they’re interested in and then we will craft curricula around them for future groups. One of our first projects for the Interim Medical Director is to create a session manual with a library of resources/topics/themes that our journey guides can pull from. Our current strategy has been to keep it broad and iterate session by session so that we can let the groups define the most engaging topics, themes, metaphors, skills, and tools to focus on. That has allowed us to convene groups that have focused on addiction, substance use, OCD, relationships, trauma, trans identity, queer identity, young adults, neurodivergence etc

We pull worksheets and tools from a variety of free online sources as well as textbooks, but will be creating our own proprietary ones as well

For our newer therapists, we work with them to pick themes ahead of time and standardize them. For our more experienced ones, we purposefully give them our most complicated cases so that they can help us tailor the support models to them.

Generally here’s how the model progresses

First 4 sessions are around building rapport, general level-set of skills and understanding, process-setting

Sessions 5-8 focus on deeper vulnerability and sharing activities like our life narrative exercise

Then the group chooses specific focus area or they continue with a general EBT + psychodynamic approach if it’s an open group

What tools / resources do therapists have at their disposal today for journey sessions or interactions with their groups? How do you think about attracting and retaining the highest quality clinician network as you scale?

We onboard, do a training session with “friendly” members, a gaming training session, have a gaming moderator help with in-game journeyer support, and have a co-facilitator ready in case they need the support. We have escalation plans, safety plan templates, and emergency resources.

Worksheets are generally provided by the facilitator as they go. Half of it is psychodynamic and half is more skills based, we pull these from a variety of sources and are building a library in google drive to support.

How to attract and retain the highest quality clinicians

Guarantee hours and group sizes

We handle all journeryer communication, scheduling, support, onboarding, payment etc for them between sessions

Handle easy payment system so that they can just drop in and out without any headache

Easy no-hassle notes for each group after session

Focus on meeting clients where they are and supporting the most at-risk populations in a new format

Taking therapists fresh out of school and do training/supervision ourselves to help train the next generation of community-first clinicians

Tiered stepped-care approach for access to higher skilled clinicians as needed, so everyone practices at the top of their license

We handle all credentialing and paperwork for payers, new geographic licensing, etc.

How many members are opting for 1x1 sessions? What has experience been for therapists and members to-date?

We only put 1x1 offerings on our website to anchor how expensive therapy actually is. We’ve only had 2 people ask for 1x1 support and both were post-op trans folks who had extreme anxiety over their voice dysphoria or we needed to do extra screening for acute SMI.

Members love the 1x1 but we prefer the group model for the sake of our product focus and maintaining regulatory compliance.

With the focus on sub-acute today, how do you manage referrals for members with more serious issues? As you grow and build the member base, how do you think about bringing this in-house (if at all)?

One of our key hypotheses is that there is more than enough demand for support in subclinical care that we can build a strong business where folks already have their own SMI support and we provide the community. Most people are willing to pay for support if the price is more reasonable. We will continue testing this hypothesis and are open to moving upstream towards the full care stack.

We currently refer out on a one-off basis to national groups or providers in their local area

Scale path for referrals:

Partnerships with institutions who can provide care (waitlists, etc) and noncompetitive therapy offerings

Build our own trusted network of providers that can tap into and maybe convert into our own clinicians

Partner with clinical time aggregators/platforms

If we are to take this in-house, we’d need to set up the credentialing and RCM infrastructure to bill insurance through our own friendly PC. Different ballgame, high operational overhead and complexity to provide SMI support, but we would consider it as we scale, particularly if we are able to negotiate strong contracts for population-level support.

Business Model + Pricing

How did you land on current D2C pricing structure? What has feedback on willingness to pay been for current member base? How does this impact what you offer and who you target?

In healthcare, the winners nail good distribution and consumer OOP is usually really difficult. We set the bar high by going DTC first because we know that the willingness to pay out of pocket for healthcare is super low with consumers, and if we could innovate a business model and price point that provides strong retention, then we know we have a winning product offering. Going to payers is a straightforward process (see below) but takes a lot of time and is expensive to set up.

Willingness to pay - they acknowledge that it’s a good price but can still be too expensive. We price it the same as a copay, so most people who already have done therapy think it’s reasonable. Cost is still the #1 reason people leave the program, so we offer biweekly and monthly subscriptions as well. We will also explore lower cost, higher scale options in the future as well.

We target older GenZ in their 20s-30s who have higher ability to pay but are still interested in getting mental health support for the first time.

Is your goal to be reimbursed? If so, have you validated with any payers and/or employers what is necessary (ROI and/or care outcomes) to be reimbursed?

Yes. There are existing FFS billing codes that we can already use for telemedicine care with group therapy (CPT Code 90853) and are reimbursed by both medicaid and commercial carriers and rates that are comparable/higher than our OOP cost. We’d just need to credential our provider group and our clinicians with each payer geo by geo and then capture a significant enough member base for each market.

For direct or preferential payer/employer payments on a PMPM basis, we are conducting light whitepaper studies to prove clinical impact for our model. We’re preparing for light introductory conversations now with several commercial and medicaid health plans to understand their needs.

Financing + Milestones

How does $1M ARR goal with this financing translate to paying members, retention, overall community members, and other KPIs?

Brian to share projections model for growth and operations

Paying members → 694 members weekly subscribed, fully loaded. I can share the churn-included models

I can share sensitivity models for low-end retention (assume 50% monthly) and high-end based on our current models

Overall community - not sure, we haven’t been optimizing for this because we calculate conversions at the top of funnel with marketing spend

Other KPIs

Initial clinical study to demonstrate impact

Growth rate for weekly subscribers

Clinician hiring, retention, satisfaction

Stabilized recurring revenue

Partnership growth and proprietary channel access

For the white-papers and clinical research you mentioned, what outcomes are you looking to show?

Brian to share study endpoints that we are basing our trial design off of, per discussions with Professors Isabella Granic, Terry Fleming, and Stephen Schueller
