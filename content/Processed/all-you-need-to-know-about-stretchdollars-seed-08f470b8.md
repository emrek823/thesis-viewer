## All you need to know about StretchDollar's Seed

Hey there. Thanks for giving us a gander.

We're StretchDollar. We're on a mission to make small businesses the best place in the world to work starting with most obvious place — simple, affordable health benefits.

Our free to use platform leverages new legislation to offer small business owners a simple way of offering their people pre-tax funding to offset the cost of individual market plans they pick and they own (with the help of our brokerage and shopping tool).

On average we're saving small business owners 100+ hours and upwards of 25% on their health insurance expenses. Employees are finding plans they like and use more.

Quick story - we were setting a shower door installation company out of Florida that was transitioning from a group plan. One of their employees was a type one diabetic who's insulin wasn't covered. She was paying $1,300 out of pocket each week for medicine that was saving her life. We found her a plan where it was a $30 copay.

We're putting together our seed. If you want to know more about that, boy, have you found the right place.
