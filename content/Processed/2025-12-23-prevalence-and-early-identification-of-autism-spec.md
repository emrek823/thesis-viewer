## *Abstract*

**Problem/Condition:** Autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

**Period Covered:** 2022.

**Description of System:** The Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network is an active surveillance program that estimates prevalence and characteristics of ASD and monitors timing of ASD identification among children aged 4 and 8 years. In 2022, a total of 16 sites (located in Arizona, Arkansas, California, Georgia, Indiana, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, Tennessee, Texas [two sites: Austin and Laredo], Utah, and Wisconsin) conducted surveillance for ASD among children aged 4 and 8 years and suspected ASD among children aged 4 years. Surveillance included children who lived in the surveillance area at any time during 2022. Children were classified as having ASD if they ever received 1) an ASD diagnostic statement in a comprehensive developmental evaluation, 2) autism special education eligibility, or 3) an ASD *International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision* (ICD-9) code in the 299 range or *International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision* (ICD-10) code of F84.0, F84.3, F84.5, F84.8, or F84.9. Children aged 4 years were classified as having suspected ASD if they did not meet the case definition for ASD but had an evaluator’s suspicion of ASD documented in a comprehensive developmental evaluation.

**Results:** Among children aged 8 years in 2022, ASD prevalence was 32.2 per 1,000 children (one in 31) across the 16 sites, ranging from 9.7 in Texas (Laredo) to 53.1 in California. The overall observed prevalence estimate was similar to estimates calculated using Bayesian hierarchical and random effects models. ASD was 3.4 times as prevalent among boys (49.2) than girls (14.3). Overall, ASD prevalence was lower among non-Hispanic White (White) children (27.7) than among Asian or Pacific Islander (A/PI) (38.2), American Indian or Alaska Native (AI/AN) (37.5), non-Hispanic Black or African American (Black) (36.6), Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic) (33.0), and multiracial children (31.9). No association was observed between ASD prevalence and neighborhood median household income (MHI) at 11 sites; higher ASD prevalence was associated with lower neighborhood MHI at five sites.

Record abstraction was completed for 15 of the 16 sites for 8,613 children aged 8 years who met the ASD case definition. Of these 8,613 children, 68.4% had a documented diagnostic statement of ASD, 67.3% had a documented autism special education eligibility, and 68.9% had a documented ASD ICD-9 or ICD-10 code. All three elements of the ASD case definition were present for 34.6% of children aged 8 years with ASD.

Among 5,292 (61.4% of 8,613) children aged 8 years with ASD with information on cognitive ability, 39.6% were classified as having an intellectual disability. Intellectual disability was present among 52.8% of Black, 50.0% of AI/AN, 43.9% of A/PI, 38.8% of Hispanic, 32.7% of White, and 31.2% of multiracial children with ASD. The median age of earliest known ASD diagnosis was 47 months and ranged from 36 months in California to 69.5 months in Texas (Laredo).

Cumulative incidence of ASD diagnosis or eligibility by age 48 months was higher among children born in 2018 (aged 4 years in 2022) than children born in 2014 (aged 8 years in 2022) at 13 of the 15 sites that were able to abstract records. Overall cumulative incidence of ASD diagnosis or eligibility by age 48 months was 1.7 times as high among those born in 2018 compared with those born in 2014 and ranged from 1.4 times as high in Arizona and Georgia to 3.1 times as high in Puerto Rico. Among children aged 4 years, for every 10 children meeting the case definition of ASD, one child met the definition of suspected ASD.

Children with ASD who were born in 2018 had more evaluations and identification during ages 0–4 years than children with ASD who were born in 2014 during the 0–4 years age window, with an interruption in the pattern in early 2020 coinciding with onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Overall, 66.5% of children aged 8 years with ASD had a documented autism test. Use of autism tests varied widely across sites: 24.7% (New Jersey) to 93.5% (Puerto Rico) of children aged 8 years with ASD had a documented autism test in their records. The most common tests documented for children aged 8 years were the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, Autism Spectrum Rating Scales, Childhood Autism Rating Scale, Gilliam Autism Rating Scale, and Social Responsiveness Scale.

**Interpretation:** Prevalence of ASD among children aged 8 years was higher in 2022 than previous years. ASD prevalence was higher among A/PI, Black, and Hispanic children aged 8 years than White children aged 8 years, continuing a pattern first observed in 2020. A/PI, Black, and Hispanic children aged 8 years with ASD were also more likely than White or multiracial children with ASD to have a co-occurring intellectual disability. Identification by age 48 months was higher among children born in 2018 compared with children born in 2014, suggesting increased early identification consistent with historical patterns.

**Public Health Action:** Increased identification of autism, particularly among very young children and previously underidentified groups, underscores the increased demand and ongoing need for enhanced planning to provide equitable diagnostic, treatment, and support services for all children with ASD. The substantial variability in ASD identification across sites suggests opportunities to identify and implement successful strategies and practices in communities to ensure all children with ASD reach their potential.

## Introduction

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disability characterized by difficulties with social interaction or communication and the presence of restricted interests or repetitive behaviors. ASD is recognized as a heterogenous condition with wide variation in the type and severity of signs, symptoms, and levels of support needed among persons with ASD (*1*). In addition to developmental surveillance, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that pediatric care providers screen all children for ASD at ages 18 and 24 months (*2*,*3*). Additional screening might be needed if a child is at high risk for ASD or if signs and symptoms are present. Early identification of ASD can help children receive services and supports they might need for their development and to improve long-term outcomes (*4*).

The Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network has reported biennial ASD estimates among children aged 8 years since 2000. Prevalence increased from one in 150 in 2000 (*5*) to one in 36 in 2020 (*6*), and demographic patterns in ASD identification changed. Before 2016, the highest ASD prevalence was observed among White children and in children from neighborhoods with higher socioeconomic status (SES) (*7*). In 2020, higher ASD prevalence was observed for the first time among historically underserved groups including non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic children, and an association between ASD prevalence and SES (measured by median household income [MHI] tertile) was not present in the majority of sites (*6*).

The ADDM Network began tracking ASD among children aged 4 years in 2010 as an indicator of early identification of ASD (*8*). Although prevalence has been lower among children aged 4 years than aged 8 years in each reporting year, comparing cumulative incidence of identification by age 48 months has consistently indicated higher rates of ASD identification in younger cohorts (i.e., children born more recently) (*9*–*11*). A report that presented data collected in 2020 found interruptions to early identification during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic (*11*).

This report includes data from the expansion of the ADDM Network to 16 communities across the United States monitoring children aged 4 and 8 years with ASD in 2022. The ADDM Network began its sixth funding cycle in January 2023 with 11 sites; five additional sites were able to join in April because of 2023 Consolidated Appropriations Act (*12*) funds for expansion.

This report describes prevalence and characteristics of children with ASD as well as patterns in early ASD identification. These data can be used by communities to monitor trends, anticipate and understand service needs, and support efforts to ensure early and equitable identification of children with ASD.

## Methods

### Surveillance Sites and Procedures

ADDM Network sites in Arizona, Arkansas, California, Georgia, Indiana, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, Tennessee, Texas (two sites: Austin and Laredo), Utah, and Wisconsin selected a geographic area of their state to conduct surveillance of ASD among children aged 4 and 8 years and surveillance of suspected ASD among children aged 4 years in 2022. All sites functioned as public health authorities under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 Privacy Rule and met applicable local institutional review board, privacy, and confidentiality requirements under 45 CFR Part 46. Sites also functioned as authorized representatives of Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) agencies to access education records under Family Education Rights and Privacy Act and IDEA consistent with 34 CFR Section 99.35.

### Case Ascertainment and Surveillance Case Definition

Surveillance was conducted using the same surveillance methods and case definitions used in 2018 and 2020 (*6*,*13*). To identify children with ASD, site personnel requested and linked records from health sources and education sources. All sites participating in 2022 had access to health and education records ([Table 1](#T1_down)). *International Classification of Diseases* (ICD), *Ninth Revision* (ICD-9) or ICD-10 developmental disability diagnosis codes were requested from health sources, which included service providers conducting developmental evaluations and state administrative programs. California, Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, Utah, and Wisconsin had access to state-funded disability services programs or Medicaid claims data. Special education eligibility data were requested from education sources. Thirteen sites had data agreements in place with education sources covering 100% of their study areas; three sites had agreements with education data sources covering <100% (Georgia [97.3%], Missouri [68.0%], and Texas [Laredo] [99.7%]). California, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, Utah, and Wisconsin had access to IDEA Part C early intervention data. Certain data sources (e.g., Medicaid) are administrative in nature and did not have physical or electronic records such as developmental evaluations available for review. Indiana had access only to special education eligibility category data from its educational source and ICD codes from its medical source. Therefore, Indiana was not included in analyses or visualizations of elements of the ASD case definition because information about ASD diagnostic statements was not available.

For this report, children aged 8 years (born in 2014) or aged 4 years (born in 2018) met the surveillance ASD case definition if they lived in the surveillance area at any time in 2022 and they received 1) an ASD diagnostic statement in a comprehensive developmental evaluation, 2) autism special education eligibility, or 3) an ASD ICD-9 code in the 299 range or ICD-10 code of F84.0, F84.3, F84.5, F84.8, or F84.9. Children aged 4 years were classified as having suspected ASD if they did not meet the criteria for ASD but had an evaluator’s suspicion of ASD documented in a comprehensive developmental evaluation. Additional demographic information, comprehensive developmental evaluations, individualized education programs (IEPs), scores from intelligence quotient (IQ) assessments, and presence of ASD diagnostic tests and assessment tools (tests) were collected from records for children.

### Additional Data Sources and Variable Definitions

The numbers of children aged 4 and 8 years living in each surveillance area were obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau Vintage 2022 county-level single-year-of-age postcensal population estimates for 2022 (<https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/technical-documentation/methodology.html>). Surveillance areas at four sites (Arizona, California, Minnesota, and Texas [Austin]) were partial counties and were defined using census tracts. For these sites, postcensal population estimates were adjusted using American Community Survey (ACS) estimates of included census tracts (*14*). Full details are available (Supplementary Meth
