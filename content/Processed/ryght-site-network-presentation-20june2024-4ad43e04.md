**Copilot Gallery: Medical Code Analysis**

**Question:** What is the primary use case for this medical code vocabulary?

**Answer:**
The primary use case for the medical code vocabulary used by Ryght is to facilitate the organization, retrieval, and analysis of biomedical literature. This vocabulary consists of standardized codes that represent various medical concepts, such as diseases, symptoms, treatments, and biological processes. By applying these codes to the vast amount of biomedical literature available, Ryght enables users to efficiently search for relevant information and extract valuable insights.

The medical code vocabulary serves as a common language that allows researchers, healthcare professionals, and other users to communicate and share information effectively. It helps in categorizing and indexing scientific articles, clinical trials, and other sources of biomedical knowledge, making it easier to navigate and access the vast amount of information in the field.

Furthermore, the medical code vocabulary enables Ryght to generate summaries and translations of scientific articles. By understanding the context and meaning behind the codes, Ryght can extract key information from the literature and present it in a concise and understandable manner. This empowers users to quickly grasp the main findings, implications, and relevance of the research, saving them time and effort in staying up-to-

## Slide 10: Case study 1: Informed Consent Creation

# RIGHT.

The Challenge:
CROs, sponsors and AMCs spend 15-40 hours of expert labor to generate a new Informed Consent Form for each new clinical trial, requiring an analysis of the protocol, investigative brochure and country specific regulations.

Our Approach:
Ryght's Informed Consent Form generator, intelligently extracts key insights from foundational documents such as the protocol, IB, country regulations, and any pre-existing customer templates. User becomes an editor vs creator, and 18 hours of work turns into 2 hours. Make on the fly edits or use Ryght to redraft content.

**Title:** Informed Consent Form v:Patient Interventional Consent Form (AUS) protocol:RGT-519-023_3597

**Section 1: Introduction**

You've been chosen to join a research study because you have a type of cancer that has either spread to other parts of your body or is in an advanced stage, but it's not a brain or central nervous system tumor, and you don't have untreated spinal cord compression. This study is for people like you who either haven't responded to the usual treatments, can't tolerate them, have decided not to use them, or have a type of tumor that doesn't have a standard treatment yet.

We're looking into a new treatment called RGT-519-023. It's given through an IV on the 1st, 8th, and 15th days of a 21-day cycle. You might also receive other drugs known as anti-PD-1/L1 checkpoint inhibitors, which include Nivolumab (Opdivo), Pembrolizumab (Keytruda), Cemiplimab-rwlc (Libtayo), Avelumab (Bavencio), Atezolizumab (Tecentriq), and Durvalumab (Imfinzi). These could be used together with RGT-519-023.

If you have prostate cancer that's not responding to hormone therapy, hormone deprivation therapy might be part of your treatment. For any bone problems, you might get bisphosphonate or denosumab according to the guidelines where you're being treated. After you finish the first cycle of treatment, you can have radiation to help with painful bone lesions.

If you have side effects from the immune system or adrenal insufficiency, or if you have a flare-up of chronic conditions like asthma, COPD, or a rash, you might be given corticosteroids, but there's a limit on how much you can take.

Sometimes, you might need other treatments like radiation or surgery to help with specific medical issues. These are considered on a case-by-case basis and you would need to talk it over with the Medical Monitor.

If you have any questions or need more information about the study or treatments, please ask your study team. They're there to help you understand everything involved.

This Participant Information Sheet/Consent Form tells you about the research project. It explains the tests and treatments involved. Knowing what is involved will help you decide if you want to take part in the research.

Please read this information carefully. Ask questions about anything that you don't understand or want to know more about. Before deciding whether or not to take part, you might want to talk about it with a relative, friend or your local doctor.

Participation in this research is voluntary. If you don't wish to take part, you don't have to. You will receive the best possible care whether or not you take part.

If you decide you want to take part in the research project, you will be asked to sign the consent section. By signing it you are telling us that you:
*   Understand what you have read
*   Consent to take part in the research project
*   Consent to have the tests and treatments that are described

## Slide 12: Case study 3: Extract and query unstructured data

# RIGHT.

The Challenge:
Billions of medical test results in un- and semi-structured format (EMR etc). High-value genomics test records are buried in fax, pdf and text fields without annotation; extracting insight is currently manual/impossible

Our Approach:
Ryght created a custom extraction pipeline to identify genes included in each test, identify variants, list findings in a table, and surface relevant medical literature for the analyst based on the clinically relevant variants identified.

**Screenshot Examples of Unstructured Data:**
