## Slide 3: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)

echo

### Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)

#### Autism Facts

*   **50% of ALL healthcare costs for kids aged 0 – 10 are related to Autism**
*   **The average cost of Autism therapy is $63,000 per year**
*   **CDC estimates that 1 in 44 children have ASD and this is expected to grow to 1 in 30**
*   **Parental involvement is a critical success factor that improves outcomes**

#### Industry Needs an All-In-One Parental Involvement Solution

*   Parental involvement is a critical success factor that improves outcomes and accelerates therapy fade
*   Less than 10% of families are involved in the therapy of their child
*   On average, less than 30% of authorized parent training hours are used
*   Existing solutions in the market are disparate, not integrated, complicated, and do not actively facilitate parental involvement

#### Health Plans and Providers Need a Seamless Data Exchange

*   Health plans receive thousands of assessments per month via email where the data is not standardized and cannot be reported
*   Health plans struggle to measure care quality and progress over time
*   There are no preferred provider networks as health plans struggle to identify top performing providers
*   Providers see delays in starting care due to paper based assessments

## Slide 4: Problem: No Parental Involvement

4
echo

### Problem: No Parental Involvement

*   Studies show that parental involvement can accelerate therapy fade by 6 – 18 months however **less than 10% of all families are properly trained and involved.**
*   Parents know their child best but their deep and intimate knowledge is often not used in crafting treatment plans.
*   Providers are not able to adequately train families (**<30% of authorized parent training used**), and payers have no visibility of goal progress.
*   Successful therapy involves being able to smoothly transition skill mastery across multiple locations and environments (facility to home etc.). Parental involvement facilitates this.

## Slide 5: Problem: Capturing & Measuring Data

5
echo

### Problem: Capturing & Measuring Data

#### Health Plans Lack a Seamless Data Exchange to Measure Progress and Top Performing Providers

*   Unstandardized data makes it impossible to measure progress
*   Health plans cannot identify top performing providers
*   No visibility of stakeholder goals or progress in the home
*   Cannot apply care quality metrics at scale across their entire member base

**Chart Data:**
Thousands of assessments emailed & faxed in unstandardized formats are fed into "Optum".
(The visual shows multiple document icons with arrows converging towards a large "Optum" oval, representing a single recipient for disparate data.)

## Slide 6: Problem: Administrative Burden

6
echo

### Problem: Administrative Burden

#### The Lack of a Seamless Data Exchange Results In:

*   Inefficient resource-intensive processes with unstandardized data coming in from many different sources
*   Manual processes that are expensive and financially inefficient
*   Less effective and overworked case managers with unstandardized data coming in from many different sources
*   Delays in starting of treatment often leading to exacerbated issues and missed opportunities

## Slide 13: Providers are critical stakeholders to maximize engagement

13
echo

### Providers are critical stakeholders to maximize engagement

#### Incentivizing Providers to Engage Parents

Parental involvement is critical however it happens less than 10% of the time.

Providers are important to help facilitate parental involvement in therapy. Providers have ongoing touchpoints with family members, and incentivizing providers will increase their involvement with families.

#### Through Echo, providers can maximize their parent training reimbursement.

1.  Provider assigns parent goals on Echo
2.  Parents complete goals and track notes on Echo mobile app
3.  For every goal completed, health plans reimburse provider 2 units of CPT 97156 (parent training)

**Providers can make an extra $100 - $150 per client per month. This is a significant opportunity for providers!**

## Slide 15: Seeking an Initial Limited Release of 500 – 1000 Members

15
echo

### Seeking an Initial Limited Release of 500 – 1000 Members

**Seeking an initial limited release of 500 - 1000 members**

#### Pricing:

*   **Fee per enrolled patient per month (min 12 months)**
    Billed to health plan through CPT: 97156 (parent training)
*   **Fee per assessment submitted through clearinghouse**
    Billed to health plan through CPT: 97151 (assessment)

Echo plans to bill health plans through already established CPT codes (97151 & 97156). This provides health plans flexibility in how they charge their clients, recognizing the variability of employers' funding structure.

**Echo wants to partner with an innovative leading-edge health plan**

## Slide 18: Contemporary Applied Behavioral Analysis

18
echo

### Contemporary Applied Behavioral Analysis

**Contemporary ABA isn't a "treatment package" – it's guiding principles of human learning used to create individualized treatment plans. Treatment plans today are naturalistic and incorporate a combination of many treatment protocols tailored the child's individual needs for optimal success.**

**Contemporary ABA**
(Diagram showing 5 key components of Contemporary ABA)
*   Discrete Trial Teaching
*   Naturalistic Teaching
*   Pivotal Response Therapy
*   Token Economy
*   Contingent Observation

## Slide 19: Alternative Therapies & Benefits

19
echo

### Alternative Therapies & Benefits

While **Contemporary ABA** is widely acknowledged for its strong clinical evidence, alternative therapies can demonstrate benefits in specific situations. Echo supports autism therapy across many different treatment protocols including:

**Developmental Relationship Based Intervention (DRBI)**
*   Focuses on the entire individual
*   Works to understand internal events of the child to work through barriers
*   Focuses on training parents and their participation in treatment interventions

**Relationship Development Intervention (RDI)**
*   Relationship based
*   Focused on activities that develop relational bonds between child and adult
*   Uses activities that promote opportunities for the bond

**Animal Assisted Therapy (AAT) & Music Therapy (MT)**
*   Supplemental
*   Uses the bond with an animal to teach communication skills through gestures
*   Music can be an activity that supports the child's motivation to participate in interactions and connect with people

**Pie Chart Data: Therapies that Target Autism (same as Slide 17, representing proportional usage/focus)**

| Therapy Type                                  | Percentage (Implied from visual size, not explicit numbers) |
|:----------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------|
| Contemporary ABA                              | Largest segment (appears > 70%)                             |
| Developmental Relationship Based Intervention | Second largest segment (appears ~15%)                       |
| Relationship Development Intervention         | Smaller segment (appears ~5-7%)                             |
| Animal Assisted Therapy & Music Therapy       | Small segment (appears ~2-3%)                               |

## Slide 20: "Fad Treatments Are a Triple Threat" (Zane, 2008)

20
echo

### "Fad Treatments Are a Triple Threat" (Zane, 2008)

Fad treatments increase the financial, emotional, and time burden of parents and children with autism, and decrease the chances of the child living a life as independent as possible.

1.  Fad treatments waste money that could be used in providing effective treatment
2.  They waste precious time that a child with autism needs to be supported with therapy proven to be effective in increasing skills
3.  Fad treatments provider false hope to concerned parents and caregivers

### What Are Parents Saying?

#### Parents are frustrated

We've interviewed families with Autistic children to get their feedback. Here are insightful examples of what they are saying:

*   **“I want to get involved but don't know how”**
*   “I see so many behavioral traits at home that I wish the therapist saw and included in the treatment plan from the start”
*   “We are tracking progress notes on a notepad at home. Sometimes providers might have a Google sheet"
*   “We have switched providers multiple times because they did not help us to get involved at home”
