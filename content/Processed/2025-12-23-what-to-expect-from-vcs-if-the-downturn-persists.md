Around this time last year, I was getting ready to re-enter the Venture world after a few years away. With a rare month of downtime, I ended up going deep down the rabbit hole on some of the archives of the industry.

One of the things that stood out while going through venture history was just how similar many of the stories were across cycles – with many of the same dynamics, news stories, and patterns emerging decade after decade.

Although the venture industry hadn’t seen a downturn in a long time – it is very much in the midst of one following the post-pandemic boom. Firms are [shutting down](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/a-venture-firms-collapse-stokes-layoff-fears-among-startup-investors?rc=dnrcj4) and [restructuring](https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/03/initialized-capital-restructures-and-lets-multiple-partners-go/#:~:text=The%20role%20of%20Parul%20Singh,and%20Zoe%20Perret%20%E2%80%94%20to%20partners.), marquee names are [returning capital](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/02/technology/crv-vc-fund-returning-money.html), and the industry is seeing layoffs [left](https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/octopus-ventures-venture-capital-layoffs), [right](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrickcai/2023/07/24/sequoia-talent-team-layoffs-firm-restructuring/), and [center](https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/13/y-combinator-cuts-nearly-20-of-staff-scales-back-growth-stage-investments/). Limited Partner (LP) commitments to venture have been down over 60% in 2023 and 2024 compared to the 2 years prior.

And sure enough, with this downturn, many of the news stories that we’ve seen over the past year have looked eerily similar to those of cycles past. Swap out the venture firm or company names and many of the headlines in the news today could have been copy-pasted from those 16 years ago in 2009, 24 years ago in 2001, 35 years ago in the early 1990s, and so on.

Given the numerous parallels, I thought it’d be worthwhile to pull out some of the recurring patterns from previous downturns to shine a light on what might be coming if the downturn continues.

This post feels a bit delayed to share given that we’re a couple of years into the downturn. However, the intention here is not to make bold predictions of what is to come, but rather just highlight some of the recurring patterns through history to keep an eye out for and to strategize and plan around. We’ve started to see early signs of several of these patterns emerge over the past 18 months and could see these accelerate or others re-emerge if the downturn continues.

### **Mapping the previous cycles**

Before diving into the themes, it's worth a quick look at the previous cycles. The timeline below shows new dollar commitments from Limited Partners to VC firms since 1969[1](https://newsletter.equal.vc/p/venture-downturns#footnote-1-154346389). Although there are several ways to look at the health of the venture industry over time, this metric can serve as a good proxy for our purposes.

The image shows 5 major periods of decline over the past 55 years. Although each downturn has had its own unique elements, there are a surprising number of parallels related to the impact on firms, the strategic shift we see from VCs and LPs, and the impact on portfolio companies and the broader tech ecosystem. I’ve pulled some of the most notable ones below.

### **What we may see in the coming years**

#### **1. Firms shut down and capital consolidates**

Every downturn sees a mass shuttering of VC firms across the industry[2](https://newsletter.equal.vc/p/venture-downturns#footnote-2-154346389).

Not surprisingly, many underperforming firms shut down as they struggle to raise new funds or their GPs find other opportunities to pursue. Certain groups, such as Emerging Managers and smaller generalist funds, tend to be particularly impacted as LPs prioritize firms with proven track records[3](https://newsletter.equal.vc/p/venture-downturns#footnote-3-154346389). As the market contracts, much of the capital consolidates around a few firms, with larger established firms taking a disproportionate share of LP dollars.

Given the 10-year life cycles of traditional funds, the shutdown is slow and many ‘zombie’ firms remain around for many years – appearing to be alive when they do not have dry powder to invest in new companies[4](https://newsletter.equal.vc/p/venture-downturns#footnote-4-154346389).

However, in addition to the underperforming firms, downturns also impact some of the very successful firms as partnerships dissolve and individual GPs decide to go their separate ways.

Those that perished or disbanded included many leading firms of their respective generations, including TVI (early backers of Sun, Microsoft, and Compaq), Sevin Rosen (Lotus and Compaq), Shaw Venture Partners (Costco), Merrill Pickard (ancestor to Benchmark), and Adler & Co (ancestor to Accel) amongst many others.

We’re seeing early signs of this as an initial wave of firms shut down in 2024. Several investors are now predicting the ‘Extinction of Venture Capital’ as we know it[5](https://newsletter.equal.vc/p/venture-downturns#footnote-5-154346389). We’ve also started to see massive capital consolidation – with just [10 firms accounting for over 56%](https://x.com/credistick/status/1867369850298908732?s=46&t=Lt0j4FNjLAWeeebivwFydQ) of LP capital raised in 2024.

#### **2. The downsizing of funds & fees (‘Right-Sizing’)**

Venture firms tend to balloon in size during the good times. Many raise larger and more frequent funds.

This comes crashing down as the tide goes out and LP appetite cools. When this happens, many firms choose (or are forced) to raise smaller funds deemed to be more reasonable to invest in just the highest quality opportunities[6](https://newsletter.equal.vc/p/venture-downturns#footnote-6-154346389)[7](https://newsletter.equal.vc/p/venture-downturns#footnote-7-154346389). In parallel, many firms that have been able to get away with premium fees are forced to revert to industry standards if they haven’t demonstrated excess returns.

Firms also have sometimes chosen to return capital they have already raised to invest in fewer, higher-quality opportunities. After the .com bubble of the late ‘90s, many of the top venture capital firms decided to return uninvested capital to LPs including Accel, Kleiner Perkins, Austin Ventures, and others – with returned capital accounting for more capital than new capital raised in 2002[8](https://newsletter.equal.vc/p/venture-downturns#footnote-8-154346389).

Although we haven’t seen much publicly reported recently on this, [CRV recently announced](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/02/technology/crv-vc-fund-returning-money.html) they’ll be returning some of its uninvested capital. Coatue, Tiger, and Sequoia are just a few of the firms that [have reportedly](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/coatue-raises-1-4-billion-fund-cuts-fees-as-venture-firms-navigate-frigid-market?rc=dnrcj4) cut fees on certain recent funds. Several others have reported targeting smaller funds going forward. As many venture firms come to market in the coming year or two to raise after their 2021/22 vintages, we may see many more choose to ‘right-size’ their funds.

#### **3. A generational transition happens – by choice or force**

With every downturn, many firms see a changing of the guard. Senior leaders retire, not wanting to sign up for another 10+ year fund. At the same time, many firms decide to transition out Partners that were unable to navigate the previous cycle[9](https://newsletter.equal.vc/p/venture-downturns#footnote-9-154346389).

Firms that adequately navigate this transition see new leaders emerge. Those that don’t promote up see many younger partners or principals depart to start their own firms to capture better economics in advance of the next cycle[10](https://newsletter.equal.vc/p/venture-downturns#footnote-10-154346389).

The first few years of the downturn often see a larger number of firm transitions, and the early signs of an upswing are when many people leave to start their own firms as LP appetite increases. This generation gap creates a great opportunity for younger investors to emerge as industry leaders and make a name for themselves over the coming decade. This changing of senior leaders often results in a tougher time for the industry at large as LPs and founders have to navigate these changes.

In the past 2 years, we’ve already started to see early signs of this, as [dozens of legendary investors](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/13/technology/venture-capital-silicon-valley-investors.html) take a step back at their firms. We’re also seeing early signs of [established investors at larger firms leaving](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-23/why-vc-partners-are-leaving-firms-like-a16z-founders-fund-and-more?sref=aUVRqr2j) to start their own firms, with some [choosing to do so solo](https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/from-elad-gil-to-matt-miller-why-venture-gps-keep-going-solo).

#### **4. Firms shift to other asset classes**

As venture firms increase their Assets Under Management (AUM) in the boom times, firms recognize writing larger checks is an easier way to deploy capital and generate fees[11](https://newsletter.equal.vc/p/venture-downturns#footnote-11-154346389). As the tide goes out in the venture market, many in history have chosen to look at other asset classes to continue to raise larger funds.

In the ‘70s, venture firms started to invest in growth firms and the public markets. In the late ‘80s, many firms decided to go the route of buyouts, with some leading venture firms permanently shifting to P.E. like Warburg Pincus, J.H. Whitney, and Brentwood Associates[12](https://newsletter.equal.vc/p/venture-downturns#footnote-12-154346389). Many others made it a part of their strategy at the time, including the likes of Sequoia, Adler & Co\*, and Merrill Pickard\*. Leveraged Buyouts (LBOs) went from accounting for 0% of VC dollars in 1980 to 20% by 1988[13](https://newsletter.equal.vc/p/venture-downturns#footnote-13-154346389). In parallel the amount of capital going to seed & early-stage rounds went from 25% in 1980 to 12.5% in 1988[14](https://newsletter.equal.vc/p/venture-downturns#footnote-14-154346389).

Over the past 15 years, we’ve seen many firms choose to raise ever larger funds and in parallel build out large platform teams of ex-operators to support portfolio companies. If the pattern continues, we may see many of these firms look to expand into other assets, bringing a new definition to crossover funds[15](https://newsletter.equal.vc/p/venture-downturns#footnote-15-154346389).

We’ve already seen some signs of this activity, many through the lens of leveraging acquisitions to transform operations with technology. [General Catalyst recently signed an agreement to acquire Summa Health](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/health-tech/general-catalysts-hatco-moves-forward-485m-summa-health-deal), an Ohio-based hospital system. [Lightspeed announced](https://lsvp.com/stories/building-new-capabilties-for-the-new-prominence-of-private-markets/) they’re building a new team to do PE-style transactions and take minority buy-out positions. And firms like Accel, Sequoia, Andreessen Horowitz, and Lightspeed have all dabbled with crossover approaches to [purchase public shares](https://www.wsj.com/articles/venture-firms-are-betting-on-public-tech-stocks-as-startup-market-stalls-11665653404) in recent years.

#### **5. The rise of funding non-technical businesses**

VCs tend to be less risk-seeking when times are tough. However, not all types of risks are equally impacted as firms still need to invest. During these times, investors often choose to take fewer tech or new market risks and are more willing to take on risks where market demand is proven.

One of the ways this plays out is firms backing more mainstream businesses, historically including retailers, quick-service restaurants, franchises, s
