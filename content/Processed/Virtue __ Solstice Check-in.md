### Fundraising Strategy & Timeline

- Target timeline: January 2026
	- Want signed contracts from current pipeline before raising
	- Conservative estimate: $1M ARR, potentially $2-3M
- Position of strength approach
	- Not desperate to fundraise immediately
	- 30-60 day delay acceptable if significantly improves metrics/valuation
	- Series A market currently “preempted or not”
- Story development needed
	- 3-page max narrative focusing on big picture vision
	- Couple bottom-up execution with market opportunity
	- Leverage inbound interest and strong engineering team in NYC
	- Market timing favorable: pharma bringing marketing in-house, agencies struggling

### Market Position & Opportunity

- Strong inbound interest from investors
- Favorable market dynamics
	- Pharma companies bringing marketing in-house
	- Traditional agencies being disrupted
	- Future of pharma commercial/marketing changing significantly
	- Need for platforms to support MLR and compliance requirements

### Next Steps

- Aris to prepare 3-page fundraising narrative by next week
- In-person team meeting planned for NYC
	- Wednesday afternoon October 29th or Thursday morning October 30th
	- Focus on fundraising preparation and strategy alignment
- Continue converting pipeline opportunities to signed contracts
- Finalize agency hire decision after Monday NYC meeting
