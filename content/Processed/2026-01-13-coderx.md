# Pharmacists open-sourcing pharmacy

Open drug data holds a lot of value, but it’s difficult to work with. We are pharmacist-developer hybrids reducing the barrier to entry by building an open-source drug data platform.

## An open drug data platform designed and curated by pharmacists

We have felt the pain of working with raw open drug data while building software and want to make it better for everyone. There should be an easy to access source of truth for drug information that everyone can easily get started using.

## Primary features

We know there are several options available for working with drug data, but we think these features set us apart.

### Automated ELT

We automate the generation of a data warehouse containing open drug data pulled from many sources and transform that raw data into a variety of data marts.

### Modern tech stack

Our data marts are available to download from modern cloud providers such as AWS s3 and GCS buckets. They are also available to query directly in Google BigQuery.

### Open source

All our code and methodology is open source and well documented. We welcome debate (and contributions!) about the best and safest ways to work with open drug data.

## Available data marts

Browse a selection of our available data marts. We can also create custom data marts to meet your needs.

### Drug products

You can think of a drug product as something a patient might be prescribed. It usually represents the concept of an ingredient, strength, and dose form.

**Product details**

* Description
* Ingredient(s)
* Strength(s) of ingredients
* Brand vs generic indicator
* Controlled substance classification

**[View data mart →](/data-marts/products)**

**Products to inactive ingredients**

* Drug products can have many inactive ingredients
* Inactive ingredients can be important for patients with allergies
* Inactive ingredients may play a factor in drug supply chain issues

### NDCs (National Drug Codes)

A single drug product can be manufactured at dozens of facilities by different companies. Each one of those can give their own product a different NDC.

**All NDCs and descriptions**

* A comprehensive dictionary of NDCs is critical for almost anyone working with drug data. We get our list from 5 different sources and compile them in such a way to prefer certain sources over others.
* Wherever possible, we provide a map to an RxNorm normalized product description and product-level RXCUI. Otherwise, we provide a somewhat normalized FDA product description.

### Drug classification

A common task when dealing with drug data is classifying different drug products. Is this an ACE Inhibitor? Which drugs may treat diabetes? We make the best open drug classification systems easy to use.

**ATC 1-4 codes to products**

* ATC is a well-known drug classification hierarchy with four major levels. For a long time, these hierarchies were only mapped to ingredient-level data. NLM has recently mapped them to product level codes. We make this mapping easy to find and use.

### Helping a children’s hospital check products for inactive ingredients

When a hospital needs to know what inactive ingredients are contained within products from various manufacturers, the process can be tedious. We make it easy with data.

### Terminology mapping with RxNorm using FHIR data

We helped integrate FHIR data into an algorithm that required mapping product-level RxNorm RXCUIs to component ingredients and even precise ingredients.

### Data engineering FDA drug recall data at the excipient level

Ever wonder if drug recalls could be predicted based on the *inactive* ingredients in a medication? Probably not, but it’s a potential factor in drug shortages.

### Pharmacy claims data analytics beyond the NDC level

Claims data generally only contains NDC-level codes for drugs. We help aggregate these claims by drug product and drug class to facilitate drug-related analytics.
