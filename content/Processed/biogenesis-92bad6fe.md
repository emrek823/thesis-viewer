## Slide 3: What is the biggest problem in clinical trials?

What is the biggest problem in clinical trials?
**Starting up a trial (takes 3 years)**

1.  **Regulatory maze** - Biopharma struggles navigating regulations
2.  **Document preparation** - 75% of 510(k)s don't pass the FDA
3.  **Inefficient site selection** - 40% of sites fail to enroll more than one patient
