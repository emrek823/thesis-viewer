### BrightWise Investment Discussion

- Manchester Story has closed a new fund and made first investments
- Market observations from Matt Kinley:
	- Seed stage is currently “frothy and exuberant”
	- Example: Recent deal went from $17M post to $140M pre in under a year
- BrightWise traction has been impressive over past 1.5 years
	- Team and market opportunity receiving positive signals
	- Harry (CEO) not interested in raising at inflated valuations
	- Prefers capital efficient approach

### Potential Funding Options

- Three pathways discussed:
	- Traditional Series A
		- $10-12M with outside lead
		- ~20% dilution target
	- Bridge Round
		- $5-6M at $40M post
		- Focus on go-to-market for next 6 months
	- Inside Round
		- Note deal with existing investors
		- $4-6M target
		- Manchester Story could commit ~$2-3M
		- Virtue potentially $3M (part of $5M total)

### Next Steps

- Matt to follow up with Harry and Matt (BrightWise)
- Sean will be off-grid Monday through Thursday next week
- Emre to run point on Virtue’s side
- Timeline: Looking to move quickly with existing investors
- Harry appears inclined to raise now rather than wait
