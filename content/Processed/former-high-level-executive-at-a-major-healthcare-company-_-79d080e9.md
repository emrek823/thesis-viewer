- Vendor Evaluation
- Voice Transcription

## Summary
The Tegus Client speaks with a former high-level executive at a major healthcare company who has experience with vendors such as Nuance and Abridge. The executive chose Abridge over Nuance for its time-saving, accuracy, and integration capabilities. A one-month pilot program received positive feedback from physicians, and approximately half of the 250 physicians given access to Abridge were utilizing it. The adoption process took about six months. Younger physicians were more likely to adopt the tool, while older and more experienced physicians were hesitant. The executive confirms advantages in terms of time saved and cost savings but mentions that not all physicians were sold on the tool. The executive also discusses the potential for additional functionality and integration with revenue cycle management, expresses concerns about being too dependent on one organization, and mentions evaluating Nuance, Abridge, and Dragon. The executive confirms that Dragon was less expensive than Nuance and Abridge. The executive mentions considering switching from Abridge to another product if it was cheaper with similar capabilities, but brand loyalty and loyalty from the hospital to the organization could also be factors in staying with the current platform. The executive emphasizes the importance of brand loyalty and value-add for physicians and suggests waiting for retiring physicians before rolling out the product across the entire organization. Abridge performed well in inpatient settings with no complaints.

### Client
Hello. I’m conducting some research on clinical documentation. So let's kind of maybe start with your background and then we can dive into the specific questions.

### Expert
Absolutely. So I've been in health care for about 15 years kind of running the gamut on a variety of roles. I've done mostly executive leadership and currently, hospital CEO. But I've done business development and several other roles within health systems.

### Client
Got you. And the current place you're at, what's the size of the organization?
**DO NOT COPY**
sd@virtuevc.com

### Expert
It's essentially one of the largest health systems in the country, so over 50 hospitals and 80 behavioral health specialty.

### Client
And you oversee one of the hospitals or all of them?

### Expert
No, one.

### Client
Great. So yes, so maybe let's -- since you have experience with clinical documentation outside of just this current role. Maybe you kind of walk us through the whole narrative of when did you start to evaluate, why did you start to evaluate kind of the vendors that you have tested out, some indication of your experience with them.

### Expert
Yes. I -- working with Nuance and with Abridge, I think it's -- I think that some of these clinical documentation I'm familiar with also with like Dragon dictation and some of those other ones. But I think that these kind of lend themselves to more of AI leading, so more future-proofing the health system at the hospital itself.

I certainly feel that there is a lot of good, but there's still a lot of unknown and that sometimes does worry a lot of people and I'm sure physicians such as yourself that want to be sure that it's properly documented that.

when it's done and you're looking back a month from now on a previous chart that you didn't missed highlighted but also it was probably documented. That nothing was either assumed or put improperly, not only for your license, but for the care of the patient.

## Client
So does that mean -- do you have some concern over just the -- how effective the technology is in a sense like there's a voice transcription just taking what you say down to in writing. That's kind of what Nuance and Dragon and all of that does. But in these new AI-generated notes where they do summarization, do you have concern on kind of that higher order task?

## Expert
I do. I do. I have a little reservation on it, but I'm not alone in feeling that way. I think that certainly, this is the future, and this is the way that this is going to be going. But fear the unknown. We don't know what we don't know.

And from a compliance and regulatory standpoint and patient safety, there certainly is a concern. Nothing that keeps me up at night, but certainly one that says, hey, how much more accurate, how much better is this from Dragon dictation that we can go back to that as opposed to something that may be assumed or predicted in the future?

## Client
Got it. So maybe if we could go in chronological order, in your previous role, it sounds like you evaluated these. Could you walk us through that process, criteria and all that other.

## Expert
Absolutely. So you're looking at -- when we're looking at -- obviously, you look at the pricing, but you look at the accuracy, you look at the predictive analytics, you look at the information that's there, but also the compatibility with EMRs and how that can tie back into physicians documenting their charts on time, getting submitted, getting it approved by the insurance companies.

And make sure organization -- to make sure that you -- that everybody gets paid proper it, it gets paid on time. So I mean I think that there's certainly a lot of value in it. And I think that the newness of it, it's certainly fun for people that are starting to utilize it.

But then you start seeing the value in it and ensuring that the documentation is proper, on time, accurate. It's -- I think it more comes along the lines of the unknown when you're talking about predictive analytics in the future of, okay, if you've documented, for example, a hip fracture.

Then can that lead or will that be leading to automatically sending it into your favorite orthopedic surgeons, to your imaging facilities, radiologists and MRIs and whatnot, so you can start getting everything submitted. But what if it's not a hip fracture? What if your documentation got it wrong and you're leading that patient down a path that could not only waste their time, but resources.

## Client
And do you think liability technically -- I mean, technically, clinicians should be overseeing anything that this produces and then signing off, whether it's a discharge note or signing of a note, they should be seeing. Are you still concerned that something can get lead to cracks?

## Expert
I do. I do. Especially with physicians that are perhaps at the tail end of their careers or sunsetting in their careers, and it's not so much a priority to them or they're not as tech savvy and they're just checking off boxes.

And the next thing you know, they check off a box to do a diagnosis or do a test on that wasn't necessarily needed. So I think you go back to these vendors and you say, hey, we have to make sure that every single

## Transcript

**Expert:**
physician is properly trained and ensures that their comfort level is at an all-time high when they're utilizing this.

I'm not saying all physicians, but a lot of physicians would -- don't like to be either corrected or told that they're wrong. And ego is getting the way. Next thing you know you've got 19 individual saying, hey, doc, this need to be updated or you do this and they don't. And that update was crucial to what they're doing. So it just -- I mean, there's a lot of things that can go wrong. Obviously, there's a lot of right, but I think it's my responsibility to play devil advocate.

**Client:**
No, that's helpful. And so in that previous role when you -- where you had selected Abridge, could you walk us through which vendors you did evaluate for that time?

**Expert:**
Yes. It was just Nuance and Abridge and we had Dragon dictation. So we're looking to move on to something a little bit more advanced.

**Client:**
Got you. And approximately, when was this just because I feel like every quarter, this space moves so much. Was this beginning, end of '22 or '23?

**Expert:**
This was the end of -- this was Q4 '22.

**Client:**
Got you. And when you compared Nuance, Dragon and Abridge, how did you open? Like did you display -- did Abridge displace Nuance? Or is it just sitting on the side and being an additional offering?

**Expert** (Sean Doolan):
No, Abridge just replaced Dragon, but it was something that the majority of physicians were asking for. So it's kind of just we had to look at what our options were and which way we're going to go, but it was something that corporate was pretty much going behind these physicians and standing behind them and saying, okay, we're going to go and do what you want to do. Even though some of the administrators weren't necessarily in agreement with it.

**Client:**
And how did you -- or how did in that organization did -- was made aware about Abridge? How do you guys hear about it? Or even -- yes.

**Expert:**
It was presented to us by several physicians and by IT.

**Client:**
Got you. So it's kind of like a few physicians were aware of it and presented it to the leadership team.

**Expert:**
Yes.

**Client:**
Got you. And did you have like a pilot evaluation period before you signed on to a contract?

**Expert:**

**Client**
And how was the performance of that pilot?

**Expert**
I didn't use it. I'm not clinical. So I wasn't me using it. But from what I understand and from the feedback that we got from some of the physicians that were utilizing it, they were pretty happy with it. They thought that they were -- that they feel comfortable with it and that they can utilize it.

**Client**
And besides happy physicians, did they point to anything specific, whether it's time saved, anything quantitative in terms of what drove ultimately, your decision to go ahead and accept the recommendation.

**Expert**
Yes, absolutely. Time saving, certainly. Accuracy, right. AI. I mean, yes, it's become the buzzword and sexy word for the past 15, 18 months. So it's that. It was AVANT GARDE, Dragon tied into the EMR. I mean, sort of Dragon but this one also was able to tie in to the EMR. So made it easier. And they felt that this was going to be better than what we currently had.

**Client**
And would you say -- so -- and then when you did go ahead and roll it out, did you roll it out to the whole organization? Can you walk us through how many people do technically get to know? How many people gained access to it when you rolled it out? And how many of them actually used it or are using it so far or before you left?

**Expert**
Yes, the pilot program was mostly EV and then from there, it got rolled out to the other specialties, to the other areas emergency room, ICU, med-surg, telemetry, OR, outpatient, so on and so forth recovery rooms, all that. We're using it first. And then from there, it went on that to other departments.

**Client**
And any sense of adoption? Like, let's say, 500 physicians were given access to it and this percentage of them used it are now on the platform? Or do you have a sense?

**Expert**
I think it's about 250 physicians, and I want to say about half of them were utilizing it at the time before I left.

**Client**
And how fast is that adoption from zero to 250 -- sorry, to 125 out of the 250 that were given access?

**Expert**
About six months.

**Client**
Got you. Got you. And I guess, any feedback from this broader rollout outside of the pilot? Is it consistent that people like love it? Is it like transformative? Or is it just, hey, this is nice. Just want to get a little more color.

**Expert**
They all loved it, but those half -- those 125 positions were around -- were somewhat younger physician. So it kind of felt that they were going to obviously adopt it because you've got the younger docs that kind of

## Conversation Transcript

**Client:** Got it. And did you do any analysis on this larger rollout in terms of time saved and any other metrics you're tracking?

**Expert:** We did. I don't have that data in front of me, but we did do that. And the advantages were there for Dragon. The concern was that it wasn't all the physicians that were going to adopt it. They weren't all into it.

**Client:** Sorry, the advantages for Abridge were there you're saying or from Dragon?

**Expert:** Yes. Yes. No, sorry, not for Dragon, for Abridge, my bad.

**Client:** I see. I see. And I guess besides time saves, is there any way you can quantify either the time saved or did you -- or is there any way that you measured ROI?

**Expert:** Yes. No, it's time saved. It's cost savings. It's an efficiency tool because now it made it easier to move into -- from Epic that you can tie it in to the patient chart and you can build faster and you can build better. So it just seemed to make sense. Concern there again is that not every physician is sold onto it.

**Client:** And did you get a sense from Abridge or from Nuance from either of them in terms of what they would grow into beyond ambient documentation, like additional functionality? Did you get a sense of where they might go?

**Expert:** Yes, predictive analytics, better patient outcomes, higher utilization or higher probability of value-based care, more accurately to stay, reduced readmissions. I mean there certainly were. I didn't stay around long enough to see those outcomes. I'm just not completely sold that, that was always going to be the case still.

**Client:** Got it. And any comments from you in terms of like -- some of these players have mentioned they could go into revenue cycle or like making the billing and the coding more efficient right in the note because they're upstream in the note. Do you believe that they're -- that them coming from clinical documentation, they could kind of ease into that part of the revenue cycle? Or does that seem like a stretch?

**Expert:** I think that they can, but not everybody. I don't think everyone is going to do that, and it seems a little unrealistic. Now you're putting patient charting with billing. And while it does sound great in theory, I don't think it's always going to happen, in my opinion, at least we're not there yet.

On the other side, you don't want to be too dependent. My other thing on that one is, I wouldn't want to be too dependent on just one organization that has it all because there's risks involved there with hyper violations or malware or ransom attacks. I'm just concerned about that when we're using just one.

**Client:**
So like how do you compare that with your use of like an EMR, like One?

**Expert:**
Well, EMR is separate from the RCM vendor. They're not the same ones. Charts stay separate, in other words.

**Client:**
Would you -- it sounds like you would use various products that would that -- what would that look like? Would that be everything, all these products ideally integrated with each other versus being fully dependent on one platform?

**Expert:**
They can commit with each other. They just may not be in the same universe. I -- you can all tie it in together and they can -- the software can be compatible. But that doesn't necessarily mean the same organization is doing everything at the same time.

**Client:**
And let's say, hypothetically, it was -- that was the case where you adopted several point solutions that integrated with each other. But the integration manifested in a way such that it was, let's say, 80% of the capabilities or ease-of-use as compared to fast forward of what Abridge would be like the all-in-one solution in the future. Would you still use the point solutions under knowing that the quality might be slightly worse than, let's say, going all in on one, one platform. Just trying to understand the trade-offs that you're thinking about.

**Expert**
Sean Doolan

sd@virtuevc.com
Yes. When you think about those trade-offs, you just -- more than anything, you just look about your concern about the exposure and the risk. But if there's something that there's a second kind of firewall or protect it and just cut it off, should there be some sort of ransomware attack from the outside, right. It's great. But the concern still remains and if you're using utilizing one vendor for RCM and EMR, you're at a major risk. And I mean, I'll give you an example of organizations that have been attacked via ransomware in the last six months. And I actually spoke to a colleague yesterday who -- his hospital was hit and they're doing paper charts right now. They had to divert all their patients to other hospitals, and they're still using paper charts and they had to rebuild their whole system because of this. And this was hit on Thanksgiving Day. Vulnerability because everybody is out. That should scare people.

**Client:**
So besides Nuance and Abridge, those are the only two vendors you evaluated at your previous role?

**Expert:**
Yes, and Dragon.

**Client:**
Yes, yes, and Dragon. In your current role, are you evaluating any new opportunities? Or did you guys actually just decide on Nuance because usually Nuance isn't there. Just I wonder if you guys have gone through the whole next-generation company assessment or not?

### Conversation

**Client**: And is that a priority? Why is that not being evaluated right now?

**Expert**: Not -- just our priorities are aligned in other avenues right now. Anyway, we're not really completely focused on this. And then there's other capital equipment that need to be purchased, another priorities that need to take place versus these types of software system.

**Client**: And are you personally aware of any other documentation tools outside of Nuance and Abridge in terms of kind of this next-generation ability to use generative tools?

**Expert**: There are some, but none come to mind. I mean I know that there's going to be. I think -- I'm not mistaken, I believe Nuance is going to tie with Microsoft, but I mean you're going to find -- there's going to be some other ones.

I think there's -- I don't know if Clarify that's out there. I'm sure Google is going to come out with something. I mean, there's going to be some other ones. Dragon is probably going to come out with something pretty soon.

**Client**: Got it. And in terms of just pricing, when you were -- in your previous role when you were evaluating Abridge and Nuance, were they in the similar band? Could you comment just anything on -- in terms of how much you're paying for these?

**Expert**: They are similar in terms of how much its charging. I'm not sure if I'm at liberty to say how much I'm paying though.

**Client**: And so this is Nuance, Dragon versus Abridge were about the same.

**Expert**: Yes. Well, no, Dragon was less. I will say that, Dragon is less than Nuance and Abridge.

**Client**: And did you evaluate a Nuance DAX at that time? Because Dragon from what I understand is just a transcription. DAX does at least some kind of note, has a little more depth on the notes. Did you evaluate that?

**Expert**: Yes, the copilot. Yes.

**Client**: And you didn't go with it?

**Expert**: No, we did.

## Client
I'm sorry. But I thought you mentioned Abridge replaced Dragon. And without Dragon, you can't really have the Nuance Copilot or if I misunderstanding, please do clarify.

## Expert
Wait a minute. You said Dragon, what was that again?

## Client
So I recall you saying that Abridge -- you selected Abridge and you replace the Dragon with it.

## Expert
Correct.

## Client
You replaced Dragon with Abridge, but you said you also evaluated Nuance Copilot, which I view as a different product within Nuance. But it is the more advanced product. Just curious if you evaluated that and still went with the Abridge it sounds like.

## Expert
We did still go with Abridge, yes, but we did look at that one at the Nuance DAX copilot, yes, that's tied into the Dragon.

## Client
Sorry, did you pay for it? Or you didn't pay for it?

## Expert
No, we did not.

## Client
Got it. On terms of you have to switch from Abridge to another product and how easy or difficult is that if, let's say, another product came in materially less expensive but with similar capabilities or, let's say, slightly less capabilities but materially cheaper?

## Expert
Less capabilities, but cheaper. I would certainly consider it. Absolutely.

## Client
And just to follow that line of thought, what would make you stay on the platform if there were other solutions that came in cheaper?

## Expert
Certainly, price reduction to keep it competitive, even if the features are a little bit more. So you look at brand loyalty, you look at loyalty from the hospital to the organization. I think perhaps.

## Client
Under the circumstances that the pricing is the same?

## Expert
All things being equal, I think that it'd be difficult to switch from one to another. It's never easy. So there is a brand stickiness. I don't want you to then just focused on price. I'm only going to move because of price.

So if there's a comfort level with the majority of the physicians that are utilizing it and there's that loyalty.

```markdown
and there's a value add and an intrinsic value from that perspective. And if we were to switch, for example,
I'm not saying that we would, but if we're going to switch from one EMR to another and the compatibility is
equal, then I would certainly appreciate that.

I think also if you're going to be competitive. If you're going to get somebody else on hearing, all things
being equal, then I would expect an elevated level of either tech support and customer service, not that we
don't get it now. But perhaps refresh your courses every six months. So more frequent visits from the
vendors back to the facilities just to ensure that everything is up and running as opposed to phone call.

| Client | Got it. In that previous role where you gave access to 250 physicians. |
| Expert | 125. |
| Client | Sorry. Yes, 125. What would you need to see in order to roll it out across the entire organization? Unless, that's the actual census of your providers? |
| Expert | No, no, no, it's about half, but I think you would have -- two things that have to happen. I think a lot of those physicians that are perhaps in the tail end of their careers that aren't going to switch no matter what, I think you just have to wait some either retire. |
| Expert | And then I think the other thing is going to see that the physicians that are coming in, whether they be new, residents or fellows, that fresh out of school that they already have some sort of semblance of knowledge regarding this. So whether they learned it in school, whether they learned at another facility that be a part of it so that the learning curve is that much easier. |
