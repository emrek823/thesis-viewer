**ONCOLOGY VALUE-BASED CARE**
Thematic Overview
May 2023

PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL

## Slide 2: THE US ONCOLOGY MARKET IS PROJECTED TO REACH ~$286B BY 2025

### US Oncology Market Size
$ in B

| Year | OP Medical ($B) | Drug Spend ($B) | IP / ED ($B) | Surgical ($B) | Radiology ($B) | Total ($B) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2015 | 19 | 48 | 50 | 25 | 19 | 160 |
| 2020 | 21 | 53 | 84 | 32 | 21 | 210 |
| 2025 | 23 | 58 | 142 | 40 | 23 | 286 |
| 2030 | 26 | 64 | 208 | 51 | 26 | 374 |

### Forward CAGR
- **Drug expenditure**: 10-12%
- **OP Medical**: 5-7%
- **IP / ED**: 6-8%
- **Surgical**: 1-3%
- **Radiology**: 2-4%

### Insights:
- **Drug expenditure** is the largest driver of growth, and is forecasted to grow at a 10-12% CAGR going forward.
- Historical care shift from community to academic drove significant portion of expenditure growth.
- Shift of care from HOPD to physician offices, AICs, and Home will continue, causing muted IP/ED/radiology growth due to facility fee spreads in site of care.
- Surgical volume continues to evolve as guidelines change and less invasive approaches are taken.
- **Radiology** pressured by rates (both site of care and network status).
- Baseline 1-2% price and ~2% volume escalators assumed.

### Average Annual Medical Cost by Cancer & Phase, $ in K, 2020

| Cancer | Initial year ($K) | Continuing Care ($K) | Last Year of Life ($K) |
|---|---|---|---|
| All Sites | 44 | 6 | 110 |
| Bladder | 26 | 6 | 96 |
| Brain | 140 | 17 | 176 |

| Uterus | 39 | 3 | 94 |

### Breakdown of Spend for Average Member (Initial Episode), $ in K, 2023

**$50K TOTAL**

| Spend Type | Amount ($K) | Percentage |
|---|---|---|
| Drug Spend | $20.0K | 40% |
| IP/ED | $12.5K | 25% |
| Surgery | $5.0K | 10% |
| Radiology | $5.0K | 10% |
| Outpatient Medical | $7.5K | 15% |

### Key Insights:
- Oncology costs are highest in initial year of diagnosis and last year of life. Thus, bundles are uniquely suited to oncology at time of diagnosis, and palliative care can drive significant value if last year of life is carved into risk models.
- Spend is highly variable across different cancer types and stages, demanding flexibility of risk models.
- Oncology practices only manage OP medical and drug spend (constituting 55% of total expenditure). Thus, practices see leakage across facility, radiology, and surgical spend.

## Slide 4: TWO MODELS FOR VALUE-BASED ONCOLOGY HAVE COME OUT OF CMS/CMMI

| Feature | Oncology Care Model (OCM) | Enhancing Oncology Model (EOM) |
|---|---|---|
| **Dates** | July 1, 2016 – June 30, 2022 (extended one year) | July 1, 2023 – June 30, 2028 |
| **Scale** | - Began with nearly 200 physician groups and 17 payers (in addition to CMS); ended with 122 practices and 5 Commercial payers<br>- At one point, accounted for ~1/4 of Medicare FFS chemotherapy-related cancer care | - Participants not yet available |
| **Description** | - Six-month episodes covering nearly all cancer types, triggered when patients start receiving a qualifying chemotherapy or hormonal therapy treatment<br>- Multi-payer model that emphasizes practice transformation | - Six-month episodes focused on seven types of cancer, triggered when patients start receiving a qualifying chemotherapy treatment<br>- Multi-payer model that emphasizes practice transformation<br>- Emphasis on health equity (e.g., HRSNs, health equity plans) and gradual implementation of ePROs |
| **Payment Model** | - Practices continue to be paid usual Medicare FFS payments<br>- Additional two-part payment approach:<br>  (1) Monthly Enhanced Oncology Services (MEOS) Payment of $160 PMPM – *For practices to provide ‘enhanced services'*<br>  (2) Performance-Based Payments – *Can be one-sided or two-sided* | - Practices continue to be paid usual Medicare FFS payments<br>- Additional two-part payment approach:<br>  (1) Monthly Enhanced Oncology Services (MEOS) Payment of $70-100 PMPM<br>  (2) Performance-Based Payments – *All participants exposed to downside risk from beginning* |
| **Results** | - OCM participants spent ~$298 less per episode on average (~1% of baseline)<br>- However, there was disparity between higher-risk episodes (which saw ~$487 saved) vs. lower-risk episodes (which saw ~$130 increase)<br>- Once MEOS and PBPs were factored in, the OCM program cost (rather than saved) money – cumulatively across the first five performance periods, OCM led to net Medicare losses of ~$377M<br>- Savings were largely due to small reductions in Part A and B payments, primarily for non-chemotherapy drugs. Qualitatively, OCM led to more person-centered care and higher patient satisfaction that benefited all patients in a participating practice | |

### Key Takeaways
- Physicians are interested in taking part in value-based models (even though not mandatory); however, the workflow and cultural shift is substantial, and resulting economic impacts are debatable.
- OCM savings concentrated in non-chemotherapy drugs suggest that OCM had little influence on chemotherapy and radiation treatment decisions.
- Adjustments to EOM should concentrate savings more heavily (e.g., focused scope on 7 types of cancer), but practices will need to be more financially savvy (lower MEOS) and faster (downside risk exposure from outset).

## Slide 5: TODAY, CANCER PATIENTS RECEIVE TREATMENT IN ONE OF TWO SETTINGS

Note: Of these, only TOI and OCP (though sub-scale) are actively involved in two-sided risk; others' exposure to true value is limited.

### Community-Based Oncology Networks
(~55-85% of patients)
- The Oncology Institute of Hope & Innovation
- AON AMERICAN ONCOLOGY NETWORK, LLC
- The US Oncology Network MCKESSON
- INTEGRATED ONCOLOGY NETWORK GenesisCare
- OPN HEALTHCARE ONCOLOGY PHYSICIANS NETWORK
- OneOncology™
- ERDI ONCOLOGY
- Oncology Care Partners

### Academic Medical Centers
(~15-45% of patients)
- THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MD Anderson Cancer Center Making Cancer History
- Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center
- MAYO CLINIC Comprehensive Cancer Center
- Dana-Farber Cancer Institute
- UCLA Health Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center
- Cleveland Clinic Taussig Cancer Institute
- City of Hope

### What Makes Cancer Care – and the Subsequent Shift to Value – Difficult?
- Patients undergoing cancer treatment often receive care from many different providers (e.g., oncologists, surgeons, radiation therapists, primary care physicians), who historically have had difficulty integrating their workflows and data sources.
- Unfavorable economic profile vs. FFS, particularly given financial & resource cost of shifting to value. Especially true for hospital-based care, where the cost has been shown to be ~25-60% higher than community settings.
- In order to succeed in value, there needs to be a mindset shift from episodic visits to consistent, longitudinal care – this is more intensive and requires a cultural shift for practices.
- Patients and families still care about the 'brand' of an academic medical center and (often mistakenly) believe that level of care quality and access to clinical trials will be greater in those settings.

| Anesth. | 7.2 |
| Autism | 8.2 |

#### Forecasted PMPM Spend Growth, % p.a., net of inflation

| Specialty | PMPM Spend Growth (%) |
|---|---|
| Oncology | 4.8% |
| BH | 4.1% |
| Autism | 3.5% |
| Cardio | 3.1% |
| Ortho | 3.0% |

| Autism | 6.9 |
| Anesth. | 7.2 |

- "Talking to payors, Oncology is one of the top things on their priority list with high and growing spend." – Former CRO, Thyme Care
- "There is a common but false perception in oncology that medical guidelines and UM are properly followed. Studies have shown compliance is low." - Former Medical Director, BCBS
- "Risk bearing PCPs are increasingly looking for ways to bring oncology in house because traditional FFS oncologists don't control spend." – VP BD & Payor Contracting, TOI

### Provider Market Context

#### Distribution of Oncologists by Practice Size, #, 2019

| Practice Size | # of Practices | # of Oncologists |
|---|---|---|
| Solo | 498 | 498 |
| 2 to 5 | 677 | 2,080 |
| 6 to 20 | 398 | 4,118 |
| 21 to 50 | 86 | 2,731 |
| 51 to 100 | 31 | 2,289 |
| 100+ | 7 | 1,273 |

- The oncology provider market is highly fragmented, suggesting continued room for growth of platforms. ~50% of oncologists are in groups of 1-20 physicians.

#### US Oncology Providers by Affiliation, #, 2019

- Hospital-Owned: 65%
- Other Independent: 25%
- Top 10 Independent: 10%

- ~65% of oncologists are affiliated with hospitals. AMCs in oncology have outsized market position due to halo effect of brand, clinicals trials and research, and physician control.
- Health systems (community and academic alike) have strong referral relationships with internal groups, limiting ability for independent groups to fully control continuity of care.
- Community independent practices drive significant savings due to unit cost (vs. AMCs) and site of care shifts (vs. HOPDs).

#### Shortage of Oncologists, FTE Equivalents in K

| Year | Supply (K) | Demand (K) |
|---|---|---|
| 2012 | ~17 | ~18 |
| 2014 | ~17.5 | ~18.5 |
| 2016 | ~18 | ~19.5 |
| 2018 | ~18.5 | ~20 |
| 2020 | ~19 | ~21 |
| 2022 | ~19.5 | ~22.5 |
| 2024 | ~20 | ~23.5 |
| 2026 | ~20.5 | ~24 |

- 2,400 (>10%) shortage of oncologists is expected by 2025. Physician shortage may limit ability to recruit.

## Slide 7: WE ARE MOST INTERESTED IN FULL TCOC CAPITATION OR BUNDLED MODELS

| VBC Model | Description | Pros | Cons |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Pay-for-Performance (FFS+)** | Providers are compensated with bonus payments based on a predefined set of quality & experience metrics and coding | ✓ Limited provider friction given small changes to physician operations | - Limited incentive to change physician behavior of maximizing volume<br>- Significant leakage outside of medical oncology spend<br>- Not going to truly impact TCOC |
| **Gainshare** | Providers receive bonus payments after reconciliation period based on savings vs. payor benchmark | ✓ Reduced working capital risk as clinical model scales into maturity<br>✓ Higher initial adoption from payors | - FFS economics still majority of model<br>- Complicated negotiations around reconciliation<br>- Unfavorable cash flow dynamics due to reconciliation period |
| **Bundles** | Providers receive bundled payment from payor at time of initial diagnosis. Benchmark depends on length of service (e.g., 6 or 12 months), stage of cancer, type of cancer, and scope of risk (e.g., medical only vs. full TCOC) | ✓ Providers directly incentivized to engage members<br>✓ Limits risk of managing high-spend members that are fully engaged in AMC care setting<br>✓ Protects from new therapy risk given certain bundles can be carved out | - No incentive to manage continuing / palliative care spend<br>- Incentive to over-diagnose (which could be managed through tight guidelines)<br>- Limited impact of RAF |
| **MA Panel Capitation** | Providers receive a PMPM for the full attributed population in their MSA. PMPM is set at total oncology spend for those members across entire population (including non-oncology) and payors lock in spread | ✓ Ability to impact across a patient's oncology journey<br>✓ Attractive cash flow profile<br>✓ Incentivized to engage members into community model | - Historical underdiagnosis of cancer could blow up model<br>- Leakage of members that would only seek AMC care could harm margins |
| **Oncology Panel Capitation** | Providers receive a PMPM for the oncology population in their MSA. PMPM is set based on payor benchmarks for only oncology population, and payors lock in spread | ✓ Ability to impact across a patient's oncology journey<br>✓ Attractive cash flow profile<br>✓ Incentivized to engage members into community model | - Leakage of members that would only seek AMC care could harm margins |

### Considerations for TCOC Risk (vs. Med Onc Only)
- Value-based oncology models have proved significant savings across facility spend (both IP/ED), which represent ~25% of total oncology expenditure.
- Conservative care protocols (following evidence-based guidelines) also demonstrate an ability to reduce spend around radiation therapy and imaging (particularly by avoiding surprise billings / high-cost AMCs).
- Certain drugs are also reimbursed underneath pharmacy benefit, which would be out-of-scope in a medical oncology only risk model.
- Medical oncology only models also result in significant complexity around negotiating the benchmark, given payors and providers debate how much is in-scope vs. out-of-scope.
- However, leakage to AMCs could significantly blow up model given the large spread in facility fees vs. community setting for IP/ED/surgical.

## Slide 8: ILLUSTRATIVE P&LS FOR VARIOUS VBC CONTRACT STRUCTURES

To dive into detailed P&L model for live discussion.

Independent single-site oncology practices (and other specialties for that matter) operate at flat margins given excess earnings are distributed to physicians as compensation.

FFS MSO models like OneOncology offer a higher base compensation (with minimal initial consideration) and generate a spread through drug rebates. Note that OneOnc’s P&L could be restated as a VBC P&L, but a majority of their savings are on the unit drug cost side.

Medical Oncology VBC only models may not work due to thin gross profit / member dynamics.

Our view is that the oncology practice needs to take full TCOC risk to see ROI on interventions and generate healthy EBITDAs at maturity.

Note: This is a high-level theoretical exercise given the significant complexity of these business models – please view as directional.

## Slide 9: SUMMARY OF CLINICAL RESEARCH ON ONCOLOGY VBC MODELS

| Research Program | Core Model | Outcomes |
|---|---|---|
| **Community Health Worker Program (Stanford)** | - Patients (veterans with advanced stages of cancer) were randomized 1:1 to usual care (control) or usual care with 6-month CHW-led intervention<br>- Study conducted over a 4-year measurement period<br>- Eligible patients included typically stage 3-4 patients across a broad set of cancers and excluded patients already engaged in hospice<br>- CHWs led advanced care planning, symptom management, and proactive screening of symptoms and met twice monthly | - 62% reduction in all acute spending within 6 months ($8.5K savings per member across 6 months). Majority of this was drive by ED utilization (vs. inpatient admissions)<br>- Outcomes persisted beyond the initial 6 month period, but to a less pronounced effect once CHWs were not involved<br>- 23% reduction in TCOC |
| **Systematic Review of VBC Models in Oncology (Literature Review)** | - Assessed 23 research papers describing 22 unique value-based interventions in cancer. Of the 23, 12 were published in peer-reviewed literature, and 13 reported outcomes and were assessed for quality | - Of the 13 addressable papers, 6 were moderate in efficacy, and 7 were weak in efficacy<br>- 22 interventions included 6 bundled payments, 4 ACOs, 9 patient-centered medical homes, and 3 other interventions<br>- 16 were performed in community settings and 13 were in private payor contracts |
| **BCBS of Minnesota** | - Model in partnership with Minnesota Oncology (largest independent oncology group in MSP MSA)<br>- Check-ins via social workers and care coordinator, with emphasis on SDoH<br>- Extended hours availability<br>- Expanding agreement to add 3 new quality measure in 2023 | - 10% TCOC reduction, primarily due to decreased ED and IP utilization |
| **ThymeCare** | - Site-of-care focused patient navigation tools<br>- Patient engagement platform (tech-enabled)<br>- Advanced analytics and remote patient monitoring | - $429 PMPM savings / $5,148 PMPY<br>- ~60% through IP utilization cuts, ~20% through ED utilization cuts, and ~20% through unit cost / condition exacerbation |
| **TOI** | - See deep-dive for detail on clinical model, focused around 24/7 care coach, patient education, palliative care, pathway adherence, biosimilar and drug duration | - See deep-dive for additional detail, 25% reduction in TCOC, 30% reduction in admissions, 75% reduction in ED visits during end-of-life, 14% improvement in patient satisfaction |

## Slide 10: TENETS OF THE IDEAL VBC ONCOLOGY PLATFORM

1.  **Airtight Best-in-Class Clinical Model:** Significant portion of success is driven by ability to drive down TCOC (vs. primary care where RAF is a much more critical factor). See RHS for details on cost savings levers.
2.  **Vertically Integrated Pharmacy:** Allows for direct in-office dispensing of drugs, reducing leakage across medical and pharmacy benefits. As the platform scales, also allows for greater negotiating leverage, allowing for capture of rebates (which can be captured as VBC savings or passed through to consumers).
3.  **Robust Contracting Engine:** Given complexity of structuring risk contracts in oncology VBC, need to build and manage a complex risk model that is flexible based on type of VBC contract, type of cancer, stage of cancer at time of diagnosis, and phase in cancer patient journey.
4.  **Physician Practice Management Backbone:** Physician behavior change is critical to success of a VBC oncology model given existing FFS incentives today (that are hard to critique objectively). Need CDS tools guided by robust care workflows, physician-level and patient-level dashboarding, incentive management tied to VBC metrics vs. volume, focus on workforce retention, and appropriate staffing of APPs to MDs.
5.  **Comprehensive Patient Navigation:** Access to a 24/7 care coach who coordinates care for the patient. Access to personal and digital treatment plans (including education) Wraparound services for behavioral health and social care for the oncology patient and their surrounding caregiver group given the relative lack of services today.
6.  **Robust Technology Backbone:** Sophisticated screening and risk stratification model to proactively diagnose and engage oncology patients. Ability to predict risk of patients with potential to fall into expensive care (e.g., IP/ED). Ability to leverage RWE/RWD to enable precision medicine. Linkage with academic AMC telehealth solutions to still enable lower cost second opinion for patients who would otherwise leak. Risk coding.
7.  **Clinical Trial Infrastructure:** Allows for ability to address previously “unmanageable conditions” depending on state of clinical trial. Improves halo effect of community site and impacts ability to recruit physicians who seek some academic/research capabilities. Expands access to new therapies for community patients who are historically underserved. Pharmaceutical company pays for drug costs limiting buy-and-bill issues.

### Detailed Care Workflows:
Development of value-based care protocols by cancer type, stage, and phase of journey is critical to success and enables the below levers:
- **Biosimilar Substitution:** Work with oncologists to substitute brand-name drugs with biosimilars / generics. Requires fully employed model with tight integration.
- **Reduction in Duration of Therapy:** Oncologists frequently extend duration of therapy beyond that of guidelines. While overuse of care is rarely appropriate, it is even more pronounced in oncology due to adverse event profile (and cost).
- **Site of Care & Access:** Provide patient navigation support to shift care from AMCs to community settings. Also, certain community patients suffer from access troubles, which leads to exacerbation of conditions by the time they receive care / diagnosis.
- **Palliative Care Discussion:** Patients typically lack appropriate palliative care support upfront, leading to high-costs at end of life when there may be opportunity to provide an alternative solution that is to the benefit of the patient and their caregivers.
- **Pathway Adherence:** NCCN guidelines have significant latitude, and certain oncologists still don't follow protocols. Developing tighter pathways that are evidence based is critical to practicing value-based medicine.
- **High-Touch Care Model:** By leveraging async communications, APPs, and lengthier initial consults from an oncologist, there is significant opportunity to drive down IP/ED utilization.

## Slide 14: OUR STRATEGY TO PROSECUTE THE SPACE

### Oncology Care Partners
- Valtruis build (founded in 2022) that is heavily integrated with New Century Health
- Currently operational in Florida market, but only with 2 practices / 3 oncologists
- Pranay meeting with CEO (Erich Mounce, ex-COO of OneOncology) in May
- Evaluating as a potential pre-empt going into 2024 given company is well capitalized today

### NewCo
- Tech-enabled VBC care management platform for oncology, focused on combining localized cancer-specific care (including SDoH) and a frictionless partnership model to address mutable spend
- NewCo will contract with payors and at-risk providers through a PEMPM or sub-cap model
- Jonathan Rhodes (Foundry VP Lead) worked at Optum for 4 years on the care management side, looking across women's health, kidney care, and oncology
- Pranay met with Foundry VP lead in April to learn more about model and aligned to sync back by end of May should we be interested
- Would like Jonathan to formally present to Chris / Marc / Candace / Pranay / Lydia for the full model. Goal is to pressure-test whether just care management wraparound is enough, or if we'd be interested in partnering to build a provider platform instead (they are open to)

### Pete Shalek NewCo
- Interested in building a high-touch VBC oncology platform, likely with a fully employed MD pool that leverages APP to extend patient panel while also integrating with palliative care
- Given focus on palliative care, likely needs full population-level risk (general or oncology only) given bundle / initial year attribution does not capture full value of palliative
- Pranay and Chris met with Pete in March, and aligned to touch base as he continues to evaluate what he wants to build
- Chris / Pranay / Lydia to go back to Pete with our thesis document in May. Goal is to address his questions around distribution model, core components of care model, and employment model. Could potentially bring Pete and Foundry together?

### Thyme
- Currently in market raising capital (Holly met briefly at HIMSS)
- Evaluating expanding into an MSO model to more directly care delivery (which could be interesting to us)
- Likely viewed as directly competitive to Jasper, which we would have to navigate
- Holly / Pranay / Lydia to meet in May to get view of 5-year vision before deciding to engage further

- **(9%)** EBITDA Margin
- **>50%** VBC Revenue

### Variety of VBC Models
- **Population-Level Capitation:** Majority of TOI's VBC revenue today. MA plan provides PMPM to TOI across their entire MA book (vs. just oncology patients, TOI has 1.7M attributed lives today). TOI now responsible for engaging, diagnosing, and managing patients into care.
- **Patient-Level Bundles:** Limited portion of TOI's VBC revenue today. TOI is ascribed risk at the time of cancer diagnosis; bundle rates based on type of cancer, stage of diagnosis, etc.
- **Gainshare:** Rather than TOI fully assuming risk, TOI receives portion of savings delivered vs. payor benchmark rates – used as an entry point with payors in new markets, and is structured as upside only initially.
- **FFS+:** ~50% of TOI's book is FFS. Certain portion of these have FFS bonus payments related to quality incentives.

### Clinical Levers and Cost of Care
- **Early Enrollment and Care Plan:** Enroll all patients with newly diagnosed cancer at time of diagnosis. Coordinates a comprehensive care team across providers to ensure adherence.
- **Care Coach:** Access to a 24/7 care coach to reduce ER visits, hospitalizations, and navigate complex care landscape (albeit results in leakage).
- **Early Palliative:** Increase patient education and engagement. Given TOI receives population-level attribution, end of life spend is carved in.
- **OP Focus:** Vertically integrated with pharmacy. Algorithm driven care plan based on symptoms. Active management of care referrals.
- **Data and Technology:** Platform around physician practice management, screening and risk strat, proprietary algorithms to inform care pathways, etc.
- **Drug Spend:** Heavily manage duration of therapy and biosimilar substitution based on proprietary protocols.

### Gross Margin Levers
- **Clinical Levers:** See drives of savings on the LHS. Outcomes achieved include >25% medical oncology cost reduction (from diagnosis to death), 30% lower admissions, 14% improvement in patient satisfaction, 75% lower ED visits in last month of life, etc.
- **VBC Penetration:** Pods with 30% VBC visits exhibit 15-20% gross margins whereas pods with 80% VBC visits exhibit 30-35% gross margins.
- **Provider Utilization:** Margins scale as provider productivity improves in maturing clinics and ratios of APPs to MDs increases enabling for expansion of patient panel.
- **Market Dynamics:** Certain expansion markets have higher cost FFS oncology. Thus, TOI can drive savings to customers and capture higher margins as the benchmark rate improves.

### Deal Structure Details:
- TPG and ABC acquired OneOncology for $2.1B. Unclear if any debt was used, but 35% of equity check is from ABC and 65% of equity check is from TPG.
- TPG and ABC have a put/call option to force a sale / purchase at 19x EV / LTM EBITDA of TPG's equity stake, implying that FY2022 EBITDA was ~$110M if a constant multiple was used. Revenue forecast was also ~$3B, implying a 3-4% EBITDA margin.
- For ABC, this is likely viewed as a strategic acquisition similar to how McKesson acquired US Oncology Network, which has scaled to over 2,300 clinicians.
- General Atlantic originally invested $200M in 2018 alongside Tennessee Oncology (initial partner). Absent of any additional debt or equity funding, this represents a ~5x MOIC.

## Slide 21: THANK YOU

**THANK YOU**
FROM GENERAL CATALYST

## Slide 22: APPENDIX: KEY LEARNINGS FROM PRIMARY RESEARCH

- “The vast majority of practices are still in the FFS world – even practices that participated in OCM, a lot of revenue was still FFS. Historically, a lot of these value-based models were unfavorable to practices. Most practices really want to be involved in value-based care, but frankly they're making a lot of money in FFS contracts. Five years ago, I thought we'd be 50/50 FFS/VBC in 2023, but now I think it's more like 50/50 in ten years.” – VP Development, OneOncology
- “We have more than one way to take risk – population-based or patient-based. And then contracts are structured differently; for example, in OCM, that's total cost of care risk, so we take inpatient risk. In others we don't.” – CEO, The Oncology Institute
- “In value-based oncology, generally speaking, you need to spend more time with patients – an important conversation to have is around the transitions to palliative care and hospice and preventing futile, unnecessary care at end of life. Those require having longer conversations with patients around their goals for care. For us, we try to have more of our mid-levels (rather than doctors) have those conversations with patients, as they tend to run long and are not well reimbursed. But overall, drug cost is by far and away the biggest lever.” – CEO, The Oncology Institute
- “One of the biggest challenges in value-based oncology is the fact that oncology is thousands of different diseases all groups in one category. So it's important that, as our data and risk models get better, we are able to create more accurate bundles. We are still a way's off on this today.” – CEO, The Oncology Institute
- "The biggest lever that we see and the one that we consider to be super low-hanging fruit is site of care steerage.” – VP Development, OneOncology
- “If you look at independent oncology groups, there have been two major changes in the last decade. First, you've had significant consolidation through acquisition by health systems. Second, there's been consolidation by orgs like OneOncology, US Oncology, etc. – so fewer and fewer smaller oncology practices even exist. The attractiveness of business models like a MSO for community oncology depend on what you view as the future for independent oncology practices.” – Co-Founder, Reimagine Care
- “There are a lot of different places in a cancer care journey during which one can improve the patient experience, reduce costs, improve outcomes, etc. So where a company chooses to focus in that journey and who pays you to do that influences, in a very significant way, what you choose to do. This is why you see some companies choose to heavily focus on navigation and using patient steerage as a primary lever while others work to enable the provider in a workforce optimization way.” – Co-Founder, Reimagine Care
