## Slide 4: What is Generative AI and Its Significance in Healthcare

**What is Predictive AI?**
*   Predictive AI involves mathematical models that learns from historical data to identify patterns from the past to predict future
*   This type is most valuable to processes that benefit from RPA and clinical applications in healthcare today, as it is traceable, discrete, and consistent

**What is Generative AI?**
*   Generative AI, (aka Large Language Models "LLMs" or Foundation Models) are technology that relies on deep-learning algorithms to create new probabilistic content in the form of text, audio, code, images, and more
*   Takes unstructured data sets — information that has not been organized according to a preset model making it difficult to codify – interpret, analyze, and synthesize findings
*   Represents a potential breakthrough in healthcare operations, which are rich in unstructured data such as clinical notes, diagnostic images, medical charts, and recordings
*   Generative tools (e.g. ChatGPT), are trained on un-curated materials found on the internet
    *   The inputs themselves often contain inaccurate information, thus the models can produce inappropriate and misleading text, "hallucinations"
    *   Generative applications generally have a need for "human in the loop" (HITL) to review output and interact with the system in real time

**When to Implement AI Solutions**
*   The main applications of this technology target cost saving and automation in back office operations and making workflows more efficient for frontline staff

**Automating Tedious Operational Work**
*   Identification of patterns in large data sets
*   Connecting data sets from multiple systems

**Complex Cases Prone to Human Error**
*   Identification of tumors
*   Understanding explanation of complex benefit codes

**When Considering an AI Solution, Companies Should Ask**
*   Where efficiencies can be unlocked?
*   Where was complexity the roadblock for innovation? Why couldn't we innovate here before?
*   How will this technology change employees' roles and how they are deployed in the organization?
*   How can we identify and contend with biased output from generative AI models?
*   Where do you need a "human in the loop" to ensure suggestions are beneficial?

## Slide 5: Regulatory Backdrop is Supportive of Healthcare AI Innovation

**Where are we with Respect to AI Legislation Right Now?**
*   As of July 2023, there are no generative AI algorithms that have been approved for use in healthcare by any regulatory agency; Current HIPAA guidelines do not cover generative AI
*   FDA has cleared or approved over 500 predictive AI algorithms; approved algorithms mimic Robotic Process Automation (RPA) (e.g. executing 1 linear task, versus a multi-step, multi-modal decision analysis using a transformer model)
*   ONC (Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology, created in 2004) mandating a "nutrition label" for predictive tools in attempt to reduce algorithmic bias
    *   Will govern AI and application programming interfaces (APIs) that interact with Fast Interoperability Resources (FHIR)
    *   Will likely require electronic health record systems using predictive tools to provide users with information about how that technology works, including a description of the data it uses
*   Initial ONC proposal, HTI-1: Health Data, Technology, and Interoperability: Certification Program Updates, Algorithm Transparency, and Information Sharing (HTI-1: [Link Here](https://www.healthit.gov/topic/interoperability/hti-1))

**What about Google and other general search systems?**

| Protected under Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act | No regulatory burden when it comes to processing medical queries; 3rd party sources carry the liability |
|---|---|

Can be used by doctors because it is more of a self-contained systems; passive transmitter of information provided by others vs generated content

**Challenges of Approval for Use of Generative AI**

**1 Data Availability to Reduce Algorithmic Bias**
*   Algorithms require large datasets to train on
*   In healthcare, this data can be difficult to obtain, ingest and may be subject to privacy regulations

**2 Trustworthiness, Interpretability and Traceability**
*   Healthcare providers need to understand how the algorithm is making decisions in order to trust the results
*   With generative AI tools, data sources are not always disclosed and not trusted individually
*   Algorithms can be difficult to interpret, which can make it difficult to understand how they work and why they produce specific results

**Alignment**
Attempts by AI researchers and ethicists to ensure that artificial intelligences act in accordance with the values and goals of the people who create them

**Anthropomorphism**
The tendency for people to attribute humanlike qualities or characteristics to an A.I. chatbot. For example, you may assume it is kind or cruel based on its answers, even though it is not capable of having emotions, or you may believe the A.I. is sentient because it is very good at mimicking human language

**Artificial Intelligence**
An artificial intelligence that matches human intellect and can do anything the human brain can do

## Slide 13: Glossary of Terms

**Interference Engine**
Processing component of an AI model that makes a decision from the data and rules on which the system was trained

**Large Language Model**
A type of neural network that learns skills – including generating prose, conducting conversations and writing computer code – by analyzing vast amounts of text from across the internet. The basic function is to predict the next word in a sequence, but these models have surprised experts by learning new abilities

**Machine Learning**
The use and development of computer systems that are able to learn and adapt without following explicit instructions by using algorithms and statistical models to analyze and draw inferences from patters in data
Designed to imitate that way humans learn, recognizing a visual scene, understand written text in a natural language or perform an action in the physical world

**Multimodal Systems**
AIs similar to ChatGPT that can also process images, video, audio and other non-text inputs and outputs

**Natural Language Processing**
Techniques used by large language models to understand and generate human language, including text classification and sentiment analysis. These methods often use a combination of machine learning algorithms, statistical models and linguistic rules

**Neural Network**
A mathematical system, modeled on the human brain, that learns skills by finding statistical patterns in data. It consists of layers of artificial neurons: The first layer receives the input data, and the last layer outputs the results. Even the experts who create neural networks don't always understand what happens in between

**Parallelization**
Technique in computing that involves executing multiple tasks or processes simultaneously to improve performance
In the context of machine learning (ML) algorithms are deploys across multiple processors to reduce the time it takes to train models

**Parameters**
Numerical values that define a large language model's structure and behavior, like clues that help it guess what words come next. Systems like GPT-4 are thought to have hundreds of billions of parameters

**Tensor Processing Unit**
Specialized hardware accelerator originally designed by Google in 2016 for use in deep neural networks and ML models
Optimized for tensor operations and can significantly boost efficiency in the training and inference of large-scale ML models

**Token**
Individual unit of meaning, usually a word or a symbol, derived from a text through the encoding process
Helps algorithms understand and analyze language structure and meaning

**Transformer Model**
A neural network architecture useful for understanding language that does not have to analyze words one at a time but can look at an entire sentence at once. This was an A.I. breakthrough, because it enabled models to understand context and long-term dependencies in language. Transformers use a technique called self-attention, which allows the model to focus on the particular words that are important in understanding the meaning of a sentence
