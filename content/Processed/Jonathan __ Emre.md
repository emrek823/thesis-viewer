### Jonathan’s Background & Current Focus

- Left previous job months ago to explore healthcare concepts
- Spent last 2 months specifically in post-acute/home health space
- Father owns home health agency in Miami/Florida
	- Provides direct access for shadowing operations
	- Deep insights into agency pain points and opportunities
- Based in New York, travels to Florida for research

### Home Health Market Insights

- Jonathan Kern focused on home health agency solutions
- Industry experiencing significant margin pressure
	- Reduced reimbursement rates
	- Additional regulatory requirements (pre-claim review processes)
	- Many agencies may not survive current conditions
- Customer feedback from recent conference
	- Hesitant excitement about AI solutions
	- Burned by past tech vendors and EMR failures
	- Cautious but interested in efficiency improvements
- Market highly heterogeneous
	- Varies significantly in sophistication levels
	- Different tech adoption rates across agencies
	- Not winner-take-all market structure

### Product Vision & Differentiation

- Identified gap: starting with fax/phone intake automation
	- Parse all incoming referrals via fax and phone
	- Green/yellow/red light new referrals based on unit economics
	- Pull payer contracts to understand reimbursement rates
- Comprehensive workflow automation
	- Task management system for multi-person processes
	- Physician order automation and routing
	- Human-in-the-loop reviews at critical points
	- Pre-visit notes and visit summary capture for caregivers
- Conference observations
	- Heavy AI vendor presence (mostly AI scribes)
	- Difficult to differentiate between solutions
	- Steno doing RCM, Ollie focused on coding
	- Lot of “AI fluff” without clear value proposition

### Next Steps

- Taking 2-3 weeks to digest conference insights
- Follow-up calls with connections made
- Define broader product vision and market wedge
- Decision point on committing to 5-year focus in space
- Also exploring skilled nursing facilities and hospice care opportunities
