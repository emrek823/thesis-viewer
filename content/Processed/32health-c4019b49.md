In addition to our conversation with Andrew from BraunHagey & Boden, we talked to three other top-notch legal teams today through our primary legal counsel from Polsinelli.

They include.

1. Jacon Baron from Holland & Knight

2. Anita Spieth from Choate

3. Gregory Bombard from Greenberg Traurig.

All 3 said you have to fight back - let’s settle and make it go away.

Counter claims - pen a strong letter back

For each, we have asked short-term options, long-term worst-case (litigation). Sent over information and facts

Getting responses, analyze, pick 1, come back with strong response by next week

GC and Insight are driving a lot of it

Worst case scenario - you can give him a call

Sales pipeline

APL

CEO transitions making it difficult to prioritize

Gone to 3 board members

ROI model was shared with board members, asked when can you kick off, we want to get a signature

$500K implementation spread out over 12 months

ROE in 12-15% range

Nomi

Have not heard back, SD hasn’t either

Pruven

Flying out for meeting tomorrow

President of business flying into pruven’s office, CMO, CSO, head of group benefits, head of strategy. 7 people for 90 minutes

3000 employer groups that are pretty large. Prudential life is 4th largest life insurance in the world and they want to offer dental/vision

Our take: Nothing taken for granted. We have distributed our bios and given them trends in dental industry.

Prove expertise, prove we have product, be ally/partner for them

Go live and offer dental plan and vision for 1/24

3 things they were asking

Networks - preparing best strategy for them here (compete with Lincol, Guardian, MetLife)

Ameritas

Meeting Feb 9

Bruce is going to set things up for demo

Non-solicitation of clients for same type of product

Spoke with Myong yesterday

Victoria is in your face - shouted at me when she was a board observer. Don’t take anything personally

Deepak

2nd hand information when talking to CISO who was let go in Nov of last year.

Insiders at OJ saying that sometime late November the board had discovered that she had falsified info for Dec revenue

To bring in a group that can audit her and

RFPs for different states to help them win MA and win dental/vision

2.8.23

C&D - when it’s best for us to engage Chris and the GC team?

Draft letter last week, we reviewed that again last week

She has gone through every claim

Don’t share b/c of Client / attorney privileges

Respond to OJ lawyer tomorrow or Friday. Then she is going to have phone call

Their lawyer called by “mistake”

OJ lawyer told 32 lawyer that temperature is running high at OJ

We shared that Virtue has good relationship with GC - in case Sean needs to give call to GC

Yesterday - big VP of sales left OJ. He gave his resignation last Friday. Things are not very stable. He was driving clinic / practice side - he was complaining to me and I kept my mouth shut

CEO - has not been giving facts to the board. Let’s figure it

What is the response?

Direct

Counter offensive

DId you end up engaging fmr. OJ employees that were part of situations -> this is stage 2

I reached out to a few employees -

OJ hired 2 McKinsey consultants to oversee OJ operations. They found out that she had misrepresented the Dec sales pipeline. Second hand

The person who actually helped

De-escalate and then keep it in her back pocket

BD

APL - board members and put together full financial plan

ROE - 15%

30% of the premium to be invested in capital in our model

Ameritas

Conversations

Prudential

Nomi

Resource / cash considerations

Burn rate - $154K. How do we cut further

1 thing we have done - we got approved $200K of credits from Google so we don’t burn on all our development for next 2 years

Cut all the contractors who don’t think we need right now

Unnecessary stressors and unexpected expense

Demo

Start with bells and whistles and then go from there

Steve giving a lot of feedback

How to get to adjudicating claims

This is the key to getting to claims

Using this

LION - APL is their current adjudication. Medlink for medical and they adjudicate in LION

FINEOS - their sales team goes to the market and sells the plan. Do you want

FINEOS -> LION -> to us (using API)

FINEOS - high-level configuration

APL deal - we’ll integrate with LION not FINEOS

We are trying to influence
