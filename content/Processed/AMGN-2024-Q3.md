Q: The Phase II MariTide data clearly remains the key update into year-end. Can you help us understand what you will share with regard to this update in terms of actual data and also the Phase III developmental plan and timelines and when we might get an update from the other obesity programs?A: Robert Bradway, CEO: We're excited about MariTide and have begun a Phase II study in type 2 diabetes. The trial is progressing well, and we expect to have data by the end of the year, which we will share with investors.

Q: You are getting a lot closer to kicking off a Phase III MariTide program. How do you think about the level of spend that will go into that undertaking? Also, have you seen the Phase II data in-house?A: Robert Bradway, CEO: We expect a large global Phase III trial for MariTide in obesity-related conditions and type 2 diabetes. Our investment will reflect our belief in its differentiated profile. We are actively planning the program, and our existing antibody platform supports this initiative.

Q: Can you comment on your philosophy or thinking about the totality of the obesity portfolio given 133 is so far in Phase III, but the other things are early?A: James Bradner, EVP, R&D: We're pleased with MariTide's progress and are focused on setting up a broad Phase III program.

Also, for Phase III, will there be changes to the titration schedule used in Phase II?A: Robert Bradway, CEO: We will share the data in the best interest of shareholders once available.
