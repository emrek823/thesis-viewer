### FDA Contract Vehicle Analysis

- FDA seeking input on proposed contract model for direct VC firm relationships
- Current barrier: Must take liability for contract performance and data breaches
	- Using software from portfolio companies creates cybersecurity insurance requirements
	- Expensive insurance premiums to cover data breach liability for health data
- Existing system forces companies through intermediaries like Axle (takes 6% fee)
	- New contracting vehicles with NIH take 6-9 months plus extensive paperwork
	- Government optimizing to avoid direct procurement from new companies
- Proposed model treats portfolio companies as subcontractors
	- VC firm becomes prime contractor taking financial and legal risk
	- If portfolio company fails delivery, VC bears responsibility
	- Performance bonds required - whole ecosystem of financial services for federal contracts

### Market Dynamics & Opportunity

- Large VCs (GC, a16z) positioned to benefit from new structure
	- Can invest in setting up dedicated entities for government contracting
	- Recreates same barrier to entry for smaller funds like Virtue
	- Jake Levine (Bobby’s deputy chief of staff) tried to stop this proposal
- Response strategy: Submit formal RFI response positioning level playing field for all VCs
	- Jake Levine will use submission to challenge FDA internally
	- Opportunity to block advantage for larger funds
