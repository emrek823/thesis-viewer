## Slide 3: CEO Summary - Nov ‘25 and Full-Year Performance

### Introduction
Our goal entering the final months of 2025 is to reach positive unit economics by closing case-rate contracts, scaling EMS call volume, and continuing to reduce Care Team cost per episode.

Based on our current forecast, we expect to turn gross profit positive once BCBS Texas, BCBS Georgia, and United contracts in Texas and Georgia are executed, and we sustain an average of about 100 activations per day. We are not there yet, but we are close on both fronts. BCBS Texas has been approved, and BCBS Georgia and United Texas are in late-stage approval, with executive sponsors pushing toward a January 1 effective date. EMS call volume continues to grow across our core markets as we strengthen EMS account management execution.

### November Results
In November, RightSite delivered 1,246 total activations and 624 diversions. Payor diversion rates held at 82%, and EMS redirect rates were 81%, showing clinical performance remained steady as volume increased. Patient acceptance rates remained above 90% across dispatch and field encounters, and patient satisfaction scores stayed high.

Patient care costs declined as Care Team operations improved. Navigator overtime fell 41% with better scheduling, while navigator efficiency increased from 0.9 to 2.3 episodes/hr, a 155% gain, and physician efficiency increased 25%, from 4 to 5 episodes/hr, driven by stronger physician–navigator alignment. These operating improvements translated into material Q3–Q4 episode cost reductions, including a 66% drop in urgent care cost per episode, a 40% reduction in transportation spend, and a 45% reduction in prescription spend.

### 2025 Year-in-Review Performance
From January through November, RightSite delivered nearly 12,000 activations and more than 6,300 diversions. About 9,000 episodes avoided an ambulance transport, generating more than $21M in EMS savings and over $23M in combined taxpayer and health plan savings.

Performance remained consistent across markets. EMS redirect rates averaged above 80%, and total diversion rates held near 60%.

Care Team operations remained within target ranges. Time-to-answer, time-to-physician, and EMS release metrics stayed within target ranges, while follow-up reach rates averaged around 70%. Time-and-motion work, staffing refinements, and more selective use of SDOH resources reduced cost per activation.

### What Worked and What Didn’t
**What worked in 2025** was the operating model. EMS interest accelerated across Texas, Georgia, and Florida, and our reputation as a dependable partner drove inbound demand. We also began taking share from Tele911, confirming our differentiation is showing up in the market.

Our payer value proposition sharpened. We shifted to unit-based analysis, leaned into EMS density, moved contracting conversations to state-level teams, and engaged third-party actuarial validation. Together, these changes reduced friction for payer teams and improved late-stage momentum.

---

## Slide 4: CEO Summary - Nov ‘25 and Full-Year Performance (con’t)

### What Worked and What Didn’t (con’t)
What did not work as well was we missed the gross profit profitability target. Payer contracting cycles ran longer than planned, delaying case-rate execution. EMS sales and go-lives outpaced account management capacity, stretching a lean account management team. Physician licensing and credentialing difficulties delayed collections and complicated scheduling. Limited engineering capacity slowed product work that would otherwise help reduce costs faster.

### Looking Ahead to 2026
We’ve built a 2026 forecast model designed to support disciplined scaling while protecting cash. It assumes daily activations rising from roughly 65 in December 2025 to 157 by December 2026, with diversion rates holding near 58%, consistent with 2025 performance.

The model focuses on Texas and Georgia, where EMS density and payer engagement are strongest. Florida, the walk-in service line, and expanded Foundation activity for uninsured costs are excluded from the forecast.

**Execution in 2026 comes down to three priorities:**
1.  Closing and activating case-rate contracts.
2.  Scaling EMS go-lives in large MSAs.
3.  Continuing to reduce Care Team cost per episode through staffing mix (RNs and APPs), improved workflow, and leveraging RightSite Connect and AI.

### Risks, Tailwinds, and Competition
*   **Core Risks:** Payer contract timing and implementation pace of EMS agencies.
*   **External Tailwinds:** EMS and ER systems facing growing financial pressure; failure to extend ACA subsidies increases demand for non-emergent 911 alternatives.
*   **Competitive Landscape:** Tele911 and MedAlly appear less active. RightSite is taking share from Tele911 in Texas. GMR’s nurse line remains a potential competitor, though redirection rates are reported as low.

## Slide 5: Q4:25 Priorities
**Critical Number = Gross Profit Positive**

| # | Priority | Q4 Goal | Oct (Goal : Estimate) | Nov (Goal : Estimate) | Dec (Goal : Estimate) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Net Revenue / Episode¹ | **$291** | 🔴 $210 : $73 | 🔴 $299 : $78 | $332 |
| 2 | Diversions / Day² | **46/day** | 🔴 39/day : 31/day | 🔴 45/day : 37/day | 52/day |
| | | **3,378** | 🔴 907/mo : 703/mo | 🔴 904/mo : 730/mo | 1,566/mo |
| 3 | Patient Care Cost / Episode³ | **$216** | 🔴 $268 : $303 | 🔴 $219 : $309 | $184 |
| 4 | eNPS | **> 50** | | | 93 |

**Legend:**
*   🟢 ≥ 100% of goal
*   🟡 > 90% of goal
*   🔴 < 90% of goal

**Footnotes:**
1. November miss due to delayed payor contracts and modulated EMS call volume.
2. November miss due to cautious call volume growth tactics awaiting BCBS/TX, BCBS/GA and United case rates.
3. High patient care cost miss due to (1) low denominator from low call volume and (2) MD overstaffing from Fort Worth.

*   **Uncertainty:** ACA and Medicaid uncertainty slowing decision-making.
*   **Capacity:** Existing Payer Team is too small for forecasted Q1 contract volume.
