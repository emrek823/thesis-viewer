### RADV Business Development

- Clover called asking for RADV support
	- 35 lives being audited, charged $50k (likely underpriced)
	- Received 2600 documents on 35 people
	- Much more data than expected due to plans collecting everything
- Law firm Epstein Becker Green partnership opportunity
	- Currently law firm on 24 different RADV audits
	- Claims retro firms don’t know how to support RADV
	- Partnership agreement sent for future batch
- RADV vs retro risk adjustment differences:
	- Cost to review chart ~$20 (vs $5 for retro)
	- Finding something worth ~$250k (vs $3k for retro)
	- Must tune recall to 100% - looking at everything
	- No claims matching required
	- Produces rank ordering of charts, not specific codes
	- Massive data duplication as plans engage every chart chase vendor

### Filtering Technology Evidence

- Empirical evidence most charts don’t have value
	- If chart has value, typically $1000+ of value (single HCC worth 0.1 RAF)
	- Companies quote 0.01 lift = finding 1 HCC per 10 patients
	- Looking through 50 charts to find single HCC for 0.01 lift
- Two significant costs:
	- Cost to collect the chart
	- Cost to extract data from chart (current focus)
- Historical precision/recall challenges:
	- Last generation systems: sub-50% precision when optimizing for high recall
	- Current testing results: 95% recall, 85% precision
	- For every 5 true positives, only 1 false positive

### Platform Development Challenges

- Closed bunch of contracts but no repeatable sales motion
	- Don’t think ACOs are right contracts
	- Provider/payer stuff might be better fit
- Technical challenges with current customer base:
	- Using incomplete, challenging payer data
	- Charts too big for AI processing requiring document splitting
	- Claims matching errors
	- Missing required data
- Need two engineering teams:
	- Deployment team for customer challenges
	- Pure R&D platform development team
	- Currently don’t have capital for this split

### Core Technology Thesis

- Technology thesis: ton of stuff in healthcare originating in unstructured clinical data
	- Currently requires humans in loop to structure for specific purposes
	- Costly and error-prone process
- Vision: platform like Palantir specialized in payer data
	- Multiple models extracting details for different use cases
	- Service component integrating with decision-making services and data warehouses
- Use cases beyond retro risk adjustment:
	- Concurrent, HEDIS, Prior Auth, Clinical Engagement
	- Any scenario where humans classify unstructured data

### Q4 Focus and Fundraising Strategy

- Two primary focuses for next 4 months:
	- Fix identified platform issues (have solutions at high level)
	- Explore RADV opportunity if real revenue potential
- Fundraising timeline: Q1 2025 (January around JPMorgan)
- Key proof points needed:
	- Labor efficiency created using AI specifically
	- Technology can solve problems previously requiring humans in loop
	- Pathway to unit profitability through offshore functions or market-rate pricing
- Revenue model challenges:
	- Can’t sell labor efficiency tool to teams worried about layoffs
	- Need to highlight documentation capabilities, speed, cost benefits
	- Utility model vs year-over-year lift expectations
