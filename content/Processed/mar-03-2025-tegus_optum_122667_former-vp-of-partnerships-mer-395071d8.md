## Q: To what extent are you familiar with the competitive dynamics of the medical claims software space?
**Expert:** I live in this space everyday and fully understand motivations, business cases, and switching costs

**Client:** Thanks for taking the call. I'm researching the primary claims editing software space/fraud, waste, and abuse claims editing world. We have heard about a lot of different vendors. I think success for us on this call will be two things. One is to really crispen our understanding of why customers buy these software tools and how it fits into their broader tech stack. Secondarily, understanding all the various vendors in the landscape, strengths and weaknesses of all of them, and how they all fit together. Does that make sense in terms of high level?

**Expert:** Absolutely, and I'm happy to help. I'll use this as a segue into just my background. I have experience on the provider side going back early 2010s to how claims get submitted with one of the largest nonprofit health organizations in the country and integrating claims into the finance system. I switched teams and went to the second largest payer in the country and oversaw their procurement, sourcing strategy, and overall technology strategy for claims editing, payment integrity, claim pricing. Those three things, I don't know if they necessarily all go together, but they're close cousins, if nothing else.

After working in those roles, leading that type of staff, I went to work for Change Healthcare, which operates ClaimsXten, which was the largest primary claims editor in the market. I oversaw their partnership strategy and strategic business development for that product line. That was acquired by Optum. I got to spend a little bit of time with Optum and deconflict some things there from the M&A and partnership side. I most recently was hired by Lyric, which is the ClaimsXten spin-off where I oversee emerging products for Lyric.

As a current employer, I've got to be really careful to stick with things that are publicly available when it comes to Lyric. I can definitely talk through what the motivations are for a plan, what the benefits are, what the buying cycle is, and then give you some cuts and strokes at relative strengths and weaknesses as to why one would pick one particular player over another in the market, if that's still what you want.

**Client:** No, that's super helpful. I think we're very much in the phase where we're just trying to get an understanding of the marketplace. Your expertise, having lived both payer provider side and then also obviously within the vendor side for a while, is going to be super helpful. Maybe to start things off, I'd love to hear from your perspective, from the time that a claim gets sent from the provider to the clearinghouse, if you could just walk me through the lifecycle of the claim from clearinghouse to check cut and where your primary editor fits into that process?

**Expert:** Yeah. To be clear, I'm not laughing at you. It's just you would think that's a process that fits on a three" X five" card. It's like, submit a claim and this is the end of it. Member and provider see each other, have an encounter, generates care. Care is generated and documented in an EHR. I'll go quick, but I have a train of thought I follow on this question, so please go with me.

The med record is then updated and extracted in revenue cycle and turned into things that look like medical codes and revenue codes that are a little bit different than the diagnosis codes that may or may not be entered at the time. There's normally a nurse coder or somebody that sits in the middle to make sure things are cleaned up. That collection of revenue codes generates a claim which is sometimes called a UB-04. That's the old paper form. It goes into the provider, subscribes to one or many clearinghouses to get all their claims into a particular payer.

Let's assume that that clearinghouse like an Availity, you have Availity and then you have Optum, which used to be Change Healthcare and you have a few others out there, but most of them have some sort of rudimentary checks that they do at the time of submission of does the member ID have the right alphanumeric signature? Is it ideally an actual member with coverage? Is it coming from a doc who's correct? Now, we get the claim through the door.

**Client:** I apologize if I blank there. You said the claims at one of the various clearinghouses, it could be Availity, it could be Change, Waystar has one. My understanding is it goes through some amount of checking at the clearinghouse. Is that correct?

**Expert:** Yes, but it depends on the payer. For instance, the payer that I worked for, they would check to make sure that the member ID always started with four alpha characters and then seven numbers, and they would check to make sure the alphas were correct and then they would let the claim pass through. It may not even be a valid member number.

Part of the reason for that is you have employer groups that aren't real good at updating information and you're really trying to go on the side of Bobby quit work on Thursday. We want to make sure Bobby really is off the books before we start denying claims on him because maybe it was a glitch in the system or whatever. You'll get things like that. That's one level of check of, "Hey, is this a valid member?"

Now, the other thing you might get is some things that look for, they call them MUEs, which are medically unlikely events which could be something as simple as there's no way you have a single claim for a 400-day hospital stay. There's no way that you got 4,000 units of morphine. They check for things real broad, but just find the things that are so far out the box that you know it's obviously a screw up.

**Client:** Got it. That example, this use case, the clearinghouse like Availity or Waystar or Change, do they have their own internally developed software that's doing that?

**Expert:** They have some, and then they get some guidance from the health plan as well.

**Client:** Got it.

**Expert:** They'll have their own things that they go and sell when they're trying to sign up like, "Hey, these are the checks we do to prevent fraud. This is why you should use us," and then the health plan will put those things in. The health plan may also feed things in like if a prior auth is required for a specific procedure or if they have a payment policy that says if you're submitting a bill in excess of $50,000, you must submit the itemized bill as an attachment.

They'll check those things as well. Just being curious about the industry myself, that is a space where I think there's a lot of work that can be done to take a lot of inefficiency out of the system. I don't want to get too philosophical, it's your time, it's not as good as fixing things in the exam room, but the closer you can get to the exam room to fix mistakes, the better you get.

**Client:** That makes sense. I appreciate you pausing there. Claim, at least getting through those checks, is now going instead from the clearinghouse to the payer. My understanding is most of those transactions are via EDI transaction.

**Expert:** Yeah. It's north of 85%. I know as of 2021, the Blues Association said they were still receiving about 3% of claims via fax or mail. By and large, it's an EDI transaction and it comes in and the first stop in the door, so if you're thinking about things and you've got prompt pay which is a big deal, you got to cut the check in the right period of time. Generally speaking, most states accept that once the claim passes from the clearinghouse into the health plan, that is when your prompt pay clock to pay starts.

It's just an important line there for when you're thinking through everything else. Inside there, now you'll get some level even before you're getting to primary editing of now, this claim has to get into the claim system. Better than 90% of them go straight in, but then you have some that have some sort of errors because now, we're actually checking, does Bobby have valid coverage or is the employer group ID right, or whatever else.

I worked for Elevance, and they had a series of robotic process automation that they wrote to try to self heal some errors, like if they knew an employer group changed their four-digit code at the front. A) If you are WLUAN and we know that that was the code in 2024 but in 2025, it's WLUAD, they do run an RPA on that and see if it validates to pass it through. You have those, I'm going to call them, mechanical fixes.

**Client:** Can I ask you a question on that? Is that happening within the core admin system of the payer, like a HealthEdge or a TriZetto Facets or something? Where is that taking place?

**Expert:** That typically takes place inside that core system. I could speak to my past employer that they had the RPA working inside that system. I would expect that there are others that do the same thing.

**Client:** Got it. At this point, it hasn't touched a primary editor, like a ClaimsXten or something else. Got it.

**Expert:** You've done nothing to assess the coding in the claim yet. That is correct. Now, your primary editor runs. That's the next step, typically. More than half but less than 80% of the health plans run primary editing and then claim pricing. There are some plans out there that use their contract pricing tools before they launch their primary editor. I'm going to stick with the bulk, which is your primary edit first.

**Client:** Got it. One question on that is I'm also trying to understand how all these systems fit in together. How does the primary editor get the data for the claim? Is the claim then being sent out of the core admin to another application or is there some other way the data works?

**Expert:** Yes. By and large, it is a call out. Now, you have some that are hosted in a cloud, so it's an actual call across the web. You have some that are hosted on-prem. You do have a few health plans. I know of the one north of a million lives, but you have some that are smaller than a million lives. I don't know everything, but I'm sure there are a few out there also that do all their editing within the core claim system, but then they are not using a Lyric, an Optum, a HealthEdge, a Zelis, or a whoever. At that point, they're literally writing their own edits.

**Client:** Okay. It goes through a primary editor, and then what happens next?

**Expert:** The way I like to explain to most people is there's a distinction between primary and secondary edit. There's a distinction between the things that ClaimsXten/Lyric are well known for, along with Optum CES and a few others. There are things that are secondary edit, which is more Cotiviti is known for.

Primary edit is based almost 100% on care guidelines that are sourced by medical experts. It's based on National Association of Gynecologists, it's based on National Correct Coding Initiative, it's based on the InterQual or, why am I losing the name of the other, Milliman care guidelines. This is the way care should be delivered and this is the way care should be coded. Because they're, I'll use the word academically sourced, they're fairly static and they're very binary. Example, you can only have one appendectomy.

If your medical history says you had one, we're going to turn that one down. It'll look at things that would belong in a bundle or would belong in a procedure and then find that it's not a flu shot plus a nurse plus an injection plus an exam room. It's flu shot as a single code. The primary thing you get out of primary editing, and I apologize for using the word primary too many times, is that you get to the point where if the same person with the same condition receives the same care at three different provider networks, the claims will all look the same by the time they're through primary editing.

**Client:** Got it. Let me ask you something tactical on this. We'll pick the example where there were three different claim lines and there should have been one because of the Milliman guidelines or something. Does the primary editor literally deny the two claim lines and then leave one on the claim and then push that back into the claim system? How does the actual change work?

**Expert:** In that case, I hate saying this, but the answer is it depends. In some states, like Minnesota is one, by law, the payer is not allowed to change the claim. If you take that example you had in Minnesota, the primary editor would deny all three lines and would return a reason code saying that these three lines need to be billed as whatever this fourth line would be. It would be incumbent on the provider to resubmit the claim with the correct coding. That's one extreme case.

In other states, what they would do, some of it's payer preference, some of it is provider contract, some of it is regulation. Some would deny two lines and amend the third line. Some would deny all three lines and then add a fourth line. I hate saying it depends. You're asking the right questions, but there's not a standard way. I'd say the most common way is that you would see the three lines be denied and a fourth line added.

**Client:** Is that functionality that exists within an Optum CES, ClaimsXten, that functionality?

**Expert:** That is basic blocking tackling for a claim editor is to either deny a line, add a line, reduce a line, or combine lines. By reduce, that could be reduce the code or it could also be reduced the quantity.

**Client:** That makes sense. Let's keep going on the workflow and then I have a bunch of other questions on the claims editor.

**Expert:** No, that's fine. If I were drawing this on a whiteboard for you, I'd draw a five-line claim and say, "Hey, we're going to reduce these four lines to one and then we're going to add a line for this other thing." You take those instructions and you pass through to the claim pricer, which the lion's share claim pricing is done by Cognizant. They've got the TriZetto products. Optum has a pricer, HealthEdge acquired Burgess. Their HealthEdge Source is the preeminent Medicare pricer in the business. You would run your claim pricer on it and now, you know what you're expecting to pay. The next logical step for most health plans is to push back into a secondary editor.

Most of your secondary edits are trend-based edits. You're looking for things where, "Hey, I ran this implant through the pricer and it came out at $88,000." That doesn't seem right. That's well above the norm. Do some reference-based price checks or something like that and you knock it down and say, "I'm not paying $88,000, I'm paying $26,000 because that's the prevailing market."

You look at things where if you draw a bell curve for procedures that have a severity rating on them of a one through a five and then you look at the doc and you look at the other docs in the practice, you can triangulate and say, "Everybody doc Jones sees is a five. This member has no comorbidities. Everybody else in this practice, we suspect would bill as a three, so we're not going to pay it as five, we're going to pay it as three."

There's some other odds and ends you could get into there but secondary edit, again, runs in fractions of a second, comes back on that. Now, you've adjudicated the claim. After you've priced it, you've run secondary on it depending on what's left, both on the prompt take lock, the size of the claim, or the nature of the care, you may trigger another prepay process. If it's a large claim, you might trigger an itemized bill review.

If it has certain modifiers on it, you may trigger a modifier usage review or coding validation. If it's in an ER, you may trigger a specific ER leveling review. Typically, if the claim's over some threshold like $1 million, it forces a manual review no matter what. You get those things. Ideally, prepay, you do some COB in that space to check for other coverage or other care primacy and you go from there, and then the claim pays. I hate saying, "Oh, and then it pays." That is a fairly large event, but the claim goes out the door and then all these processes spool up again in post-pay in most health plans.

**Client:** What do you mean by that?

**Expert:** I mean post-pay, you hear things like clinical audit, you'll hear data mining, you'll hear fraud, waste, abuse, subrogation, credit balance. You get into reviews, then after the claim is paid for the next, in some cases, year. Health plan's going to look and somebody's going to go manually check or hire a Cotiviti or an Optum or Performant to compare provider contracts to what was actually paid to find errors in the pricing system or to skilled nursing facilities.

An easy example for people, most payer contracts with skilled nursing facilities say that if the nursing facility's over 80% full and they have a member that's going to need the facility in a certain number of days, that they could pay a reduced rate to hold a bed.

You need to go back and audit that over the course of the year and be like, "Hey, Monday you were at 85%, but Tuesday you fell to 60%. I'm not paying you for the bed hold that day, but I will pay you on Thursday when you were back over 80%, even though the guy didn't show up until Friday." There are things that require additional data sources or stuff like that. I want to go wherever you want to go with this, but there are things that just don't lend themselves to a half a second or a second and a half to do a review.

**Client:** Okay. That really helped lay the land, just helping me understand encounter to claim pays and then a little bit on the postpay. Let's dive back into the primary editors. You mentioned the deny a line, add a line, consolidate a line. I think you said a couple other functions were basic blocking and tackling for a primary editor. What are the other basic blocking and tackling features and functions that you would say across all the major players from your perspective, your expectation that that they all should have these?

**Expert:** You have two big ones. You have AMA, which has their coding guidelines which they will license to anybody and everybody. That feeds into adjacent to NCCI, which is the National Correct Coding Initiative. If you and I were going to go into business and start a primary editor, you'd have a technical team figuring out how to do this deny a line, add a line, adjust a line piece. You'd have one doing frequency, so counting the number of times that a member receives, for instance, physical therapy, and then you'd have these basic coding guidelines.

You'd try to one to one code the books perfect to convert the text to perfect code. Once you have those, then you get into what customer base am I going after? Am I going after Medicaid? Am I going after Medicare? Am I going after commercial? If I'm going after Medicaid in the state of Georgia, then I'm going to go after grabbing the Georgia legislative, this is how Georgia runs Medicaid, and I would try to build that out to perfection. If I were going into Medicare, I'm going to build out CMS, the Medicare guidelines, exact.

If I'm going to commercial, you're probably starting with am I going to mimic Milliman or am I going to mimic InterQual? Those are the two big standards, but then you've got a few others out there. You have Xsolis and Cleveland Clinic does their own thing and Mayo Clinic does their own thing. You're trying to pick which sections of this you can go after and then trying to match them out. Many of them are similar, some of them are a little bit different. Now, you're trying to get that overlap and triangulate to the specific markets and providers that a payer you're chasing would be servicing.

From there, you get into I want to go after prior auths. I'm not necessarily editing the claim, but I'm identifying the claims that should have had a prior auth on them. You're potentially working with an AIM, which I think is now a Carelon Health or an EviCore or somebody like that to get their pieces. You're going into the different subsets of the medical associations to try to mimic, what are the best practices for OB-GYN? What are the best practices for sepsis management? You're trying to build this. It's a race to find the content, align the content, and then code the content.

**Client:** When you say code the content, you mean get it into the software?

**Expert:** Exactly. Turn it into when I see a claim come in, I'm looking for 61935 and that code is only valid on a male over the age of 65 that is seeing a cardiologist. There's no other use for it.

**Client:** Got it. One of the things that we've heard is, for example, CMS in Medicare world, they're updating their rules or whatever, quarterly. The vendor has to then update their software quarterly with that new content. It sounds like that's a basic requirement across all of them. It's not unique just to someone who cares about Medicare. As content sources update their information, you've got to update that as quickly as possible.

**Expert:** Right. Take that a step further and you get into the buying decision of if you're on-prem, you need an IT team that is going to deploy the update from the vendor, finally. If you've made the decision to go cloud, you've got to decide what QA you're going to do or if you're just going to accept that HealthEdge Source can do CMS updates and they just deploy. When there's a gap between them, this is where you get into an art with the technology is if the gap's three days, you normally have enough leeway where you could go reprocess claims.

If the gap is a month and a half, then how do you go fix all the things that happened for the last month and a half? That's a big problem with on-prems and I could point out four to five of them that it's a massive headache for the industry. That's where talking into relative strengths and weaknesses of different players in the market, HealthEdge Source for CMS will make a commitment that the updates will be ready two weeks before the effective date, where others may only commit to having it by the effective date.

**Client:** Got it. It decreases the probability of that reprocess issue with someone like HealthEdge Source that commits to having it.

**Expert:** It does that an it also gives you the opportunity if you could get an update two weeks earlier. I know other editors do things in advance, but HealthEdge, if I could see what's going to go in 30 days before it goes in, I can run that edit in some of them called stealth mode or shadow mode or monitor mode, which all means the same thing of it's a benign edit that it tracks the what if.

You can pick up the phone and call your provider, let's just pick on Cleveland Clinic for a minute, be like, "Hey, I'm giving you a week heads up. This CMS rule, we're normally paying out whatever, $40 million a month to you on these things. This one rule is going to hurt you by about $600,000."

**Client:** Got it. You can be more proactive in your provider relations.

**Expert:** Yeah. If I could say, from all the different seats I've had, people get wrapped around the axle of the editors go sell to the payers that they're going to get them more savings. The providers freak out about it and they try to get better revenue integrity and code to this. How far can I push coding to maximize my revenue, which is their job? When you can get to that collaboration is when things go a lot better of, "Hey, I know I'm going to get hit, so all right, at least I'm prepared for it," because you and I all have bosses we hit and nobody wants to go in two weeks before the end of the quarter and say they missed their numbers.

**Client:** That makes sense. Just to make sure I understand, HealthEdge Source, they have their own primary editor. Is that the Burgess product or Burgess is the pricer, and then they also have a separate primary editor?

**Expert:** Yes, and Burgess history, Burgess built the pricer first, and then said, "What if we could build an editor on top of it?" Greg Burgess, really interesting guy. I've spent a lot of time with him. One of the technologies that they have that is truly a differentiator in the space is in that single data call. You have this core claim system. It's pinging out your primary and then it pings your pricer, then it pings your secondary. Burgess, you could ping it and you could do primary and pricing in that first call, and you could then do permutations of it to figure out, if I accept this edit, what's the pricing going to look like?

If I let the edit pass and just flag it as a warning, what's the pricing going to do? You could put in some logic that says if it's less than $15 to me, I'm not going to deny a claim over $15. It's not worth it. I'm just going to send the provider a note back where if you have to do it as two distinct calls, you got to make your decision. I denied the call, therefore, it's not going to the pricer.

**Client:** That makes sense. I can see how it gives you way more optionality.

**Expert:** Right. Comparative strengths and weaknesses, what they have in the technology, they don't have in the content. They've got the CMS content built out pretty well, but they're lagging the other. They did CMS, they did AMA, they did NCCI, but they didn't go build out an InterQual or Milliman. They didn't build out Cleveland Clinic's specific policies. They're using a few third parties. One was RJ Health, which got bought by MMIT for high-cost drug content.

They have a partnership with Concert, which used to be Concert Genetics for genetics and outpatient lab, which Concert has done partnerships with Zelis, with HealthEdge, with Lyric. They did one with Availity as well for the same thing. When you're looking at genetics in outpatient lab, that's been leveled pretty much by a third party, much to the way AMA has been.

**Client:** Got it. I think I understand basic functionality. Let's talk a little bit about on-premise versus cloud because it sounds like batch has a pretty material difference in how the customer uses the software in this example. My understanding is that HealthEdge Source is cloud-based and that Lyric has a cloud product, but that Optum CES is on-premise and I'm not sure about Zelis. Is that correct or am I incorrect?

**Expert:** HealthEdge is only available via cloud. They do not offer on-prem at all. Lyric has all new customers are cloud. Legacy customers, there's still a spread between the two and I'm not going to go any further than that. Optum will do a cloud for you, but it looks like you're on-prem. You just happen to stick it in Azure. They don't do a multi-tenant cloud. It's your computer or it's my computer, but it still runs the same way. I believe Zelis is all cloud. I'm not aware of any Zelis customers that are on-prem.

**Client:** Got it. If you had to guess, just rough justice at how much of the market, folks who are buying the primary claims editing software is made up between Optum, Lyric, HealthEdge, and Zelis, what percentage would you say are those four versus everybody else?

**Expert:** Okay, so Optum has UnitedHealth Group. There's one for you and their other, I'm going to call it marquee customer, is Molina. Those are published. HealthEdge has Blue of Alabama and a few other, Blue of Arizona, I think they have Nebraska, a few others there. Florida Blue, I feel like, uses a little bit of everybody. I'm just trying to jog what the top 25 health plans talk about. Lyric is if you go to their website and you pull down their about us, they'll tell you they're 78% of the Blues. I think it's reasonable to surmise that between Optum, Lyric, and HealthEdge, you've gotten well north of 90%-95% of the market. Zelis does not play in the primary space hardly at all.

**Client:** Got it. We've come across definitely, smaller players, upstarts. The ones that come to mind, there's really three that we've come across. One is CoverSelf, venture-backed, started four or five years ago. Second one is ClaimShark which we think is bootstrapped, but it's still small and then the third one is Virtual Examiner which is from a company called PCG Software, also bootstrapped. Those three small guys, from your sense, have made de minimis market penetration pain point.

**Expert:** They do. You're missing in that group, Rialtic would be the other one I would put in that group, and CoverSelf.

**Client:** How do you spell Rialtic?

**Expert:** IHealth, I think it was, was bought by Connolly, which which became Cotiviti. The guys that started that, I think Doug Johnson, if I remember the name correctly, Roy Ziegler is one of the founding members of Rialtic. They spun off and let the non-compete expire and went and did their own thing and hired away Harold Davis who was the VP of payment integrity for Humana. They've done a really good job raising capital. I haven't really heard much of them being in use in the market. CoverSelf, they've got a few small health plans, a lot of AI focus.

I really think they behave more like a secondary that tries to run as a primary but it's a small market presence that the digital examiner product is really more of a post-secondary edit product like, "Hey, let me look at your stuff overnight and ID the stuff that you need to see the next morning before it pays." That looks a lot like Cogitativo, but they had a product called Audit Optimizer. It was the same thing that Florida Blue was their top-of-the-mound customer.

**Client:** Let me just make sure I understand that. You said Virtual Examiner, more of a post-secondary edit product, and so what you mean by that is back to the workflow you described, the primary editor, secondary editor pricing, all that's happening in seconds, basically in real time when the claim comes in the door, but then you're saying maybe before the check is run, maybe sometime during that itemized bill review, modifier review etc. during that period between secondary editing's finished and but before claim pays, that's when someone like a Virtual Examiner would get run overnight to see if there's anything else that was missed?

**Expert:** Exactly. They would run it and say, "All right, these claims have all been normalized." They look in line and secondary is gone and said there's nothing weird sticking out here that exceeds market pricing or coding levels, but let me run more models on it on these claims to figure out, "Hey, you still want to spot check." Even if you're doing every hundredth claim gets a manual review, wouldn't you rather pick the right hundred claims? You get what I'm saying.

It's a neat product and it fits very closely to what ClaimShark has with their AuditShark product, which is the, "All right, you've looked at these things. These are things that you've denied in the past. These are things that fit that pattern of things that have been denied or requested additional review." If you layer those tools, that may trigger, "Am I going to ask for a medical record?" Once you open that ball of wax of asking for medical records, there's all kinds of AI tools that look at medical records to find things that don't match.

**Client:** That's when a company like Apixio, for example, I think has some tools like that.

**Expert:** Apixio does. There's one called Slingshot that does that. The Slingshot tool is really focused on sepsis. They've got a few other use cases but they're probably top of market for sepsis progression.

**Client:** That medical record review, is that equivalent to when you say clinical audit in the post-pay part? Is that the same thing?

**Expert:** Yes. You can have clinical audit, then you'll hear DRG validation. Clinical audit normally applies to things that are paid either on a percent of charge. DRG is something that's more you're going to challenge, was the correct diagnosis related group used to determine the case rate? You get into just help you out with this space, pre and post-pay, especially on med records, is more often driven by the provider contract than it is anything else.

I always pick on Cleveland Clinic, but Cleveland Clinic is known to stand on negotiations of, "We don't provide medical records until the claim is paid, period." If you have to pay the claim to get the medical record, that forces you into a post-pay review.

**Client:** Got it. ClaimShark, do they do both primary editing and some of this post-secondary audit stuff?

**Expert:** It's more the post-secondary audit. ClaimShark looks closest to, what's it called, Pareo which is the ClarisHealth product. Pareo was built to be a post-pay product that is trying to stretch into the market into that post-adjudication pre-pay space, where ClaimShark was really built to do data integration at that post-adjudication prepay that you could also use post-pay. What I would argue is it's the difference of if you know you can run a six-minute mile but you have to slow it down to 10, it is a lot easier to do that than to be a 10-minute miler trying to stretch to six.

**Client:** Got it. Would customers have all of this? Would they have a primary editor, a secondary editor, and these post-secondary audit tools? Would they have all three or is that only the big guys?

**Expert:** If you stack health plans by membership, I think if you stack the top 25, definitely by the time you get to 30, you're fewer than a million lives per plan. Number 31 is not a million life plan. Set United and Elevance apart, those are the two beasts. They do their own thing. Any rule you think applies does not apply to them. The way they negotiate, the way they do things just doesn't work out. If you stick with number three and work your way down to about number 20, you're sitting at a two million life plan.

Those guys behave differently than number 21 through number 30 or even 21 through 50, and then 50 on out, they're the guys that are buying out of a catalog. There's no customization, fixed costs of doing business. It just sucks for them. They might buy a primary editor. They may choose to forego primary and just go after secondary. The other thing with it is when you're getting into a small health plan that's 50,000 lives, odds are it's serving a very narrow population. I know SIHO, it's a Southeastern Indiana Health Organization. They're 100,000 lives and it's four counties in southern Indiana.

They know the four providers they're working with and they could pick up the phone and say, "Guys, knock it off." Take those out. If you look at number three through number 20, you'll see a primary, a secondary, probably some form of robust internal program that runs pre-pay, and then likely, an itemized bill review vendor, all before the check gets cut. Most of them will have two to three logos providing different post-pay services on the back end. Maybe even four or five. There is a big difference between number three and number 20. For anybody that's going to move the market, it's a primary and it's a secondary. It might even be two secondaries.

**Client:** Got it. The audit side, the ClaimShark or the Virtual Examiners, do you think there's a place for them in the market or do the primary and secondary get eventually good enough where they're not necessary? I'm just trying to understand that one.

**Expert:** No, I think there's a place for them because there are two things that happen. One is if you have an internal team and the benchmark for a nurse coder is to do four claim reviews a day, you want those four to eight reviews per nurse to be the absolute highest yield possible. There's two things you could do. You could either figure out how to make the reviews go faster. How do you get four to eight to become 10-20, and then how do you get the right 10-20 in the chart? You're always going to have a space for that. Codoxo does a really good job of making the auditors more efficient with their tools. They'll drive four to 20, easy, but then you have a ClaimShark.

Even CoverSelf, I think, has some tools. ClaimShark and Virtual Examiner are then saying, "Now, let me get you the best one to do." You'll always have that dynamic of I have an internal team that I can pay a fixed cost and I can maximize the yield and get a higher ROI. You also have on the secondary side, secondary edit is not contemplating a medical record. If you think you're going to deny a $40,000 procedure, knock it down to $10,000 without looking at a medical record, without the provider pitching a fit, you got another thing coming to you.

You've got to get to how do I get to the right selection of what I ask for medical records for? Having been near provider negotiations, if you go and say, "Look, you asked for 100 med records for me and you only found things on three of them," as a provider, I'm going to clobber you on why would I give you any more records where if you can pick the right 100 and say, "Well, on 100, I found 70," now, I feel justified in asking for 200 records.

I don't think those tools are going away. In all honesty, I think that those tools, as primary and secondary, become more efficient in that they're running sub-second. If you have a prompt pay guideline, if you set prompt pay at 30 days, you've covered most of the states. It's what do I do with the rest of those 30 days so that when I pay the claim, doc submits a claim for $20,000, I ask him for a med record, I do a review, I pay him $16,500, he's got $16,500. He moves on with life.

Where he asks for $20,000, don't ask for the med record till 90 days after I paid him the $20,000 he's asked for, and now I'm asking for $3,500 back. That's a completely different mindset and that changes your negotiating dynamic with that provider in the future of why am I going to spend money to make sure I'm submitting things right the first time? Why am I going to invest in rev cycle management and all this other stuff if you're still going to be asking me for stuff six months after the bills get paid?

**Client:** What was that other company called?

**Expert:** It was called Cogitativo. They tried to do three different things using AI. They chose to refocus specifically on precision medicine.

**Client:** Yeah, I just wanted to understand the name, so that there's that company. Does Optum have a solution that does that, or no?

**Expert:** Optum, as I understand it, does not sell tools that enable the payer to do their own work. When they bought Change Healthcare, they got a coding advisor tool set which allows the providers to see what's likely to be audited. They'll sell a tool that looks like that, but most of what they sell is this, "Hey, we're going to do all the work for you," and then they use their tool sets on their own.

They have this market partnership program they do with a lot of providers and they do it with small payers as well where it's like, "Hey, we're going to make investment, we're going to modernize all your infrastructure, and we're going to do all the services for you at the same time." MPP, market performing partnerships. That's the program.

**Client:** Got it. Maybe the last question for you is a little bit generic but this has been super helpful, so we may reach back out to set up more time. Just as we're trying to understand this space and the full value chain and all the vendors that play in it, is there anything that we're not thinking about or we haven't asked that you think we should be asking or thinking about more?

**Expert:** I would turn that on you of what are you trying to do in the space? Are you looking to buy people that are going to be performing? Are you looking to advise companies on who to use? There's a little bit of that.

**Client:** The quick answer on that is we are looking at another vendor that does not play in any of these things. They're considering either entering organically and/or buying a player that plays in and around this claims editing, claims auditing world. They're trying to figure out where's the entry point that could make sense is because it's stupid to bang your head against the wall. That's the context.

**Expert:** Right. If I were advising anybody, it is getting the second sale is really hard. Getting the first sale, you've got companies that are innovative. Optum will normally do some equity deals with companies to give them a piece of population to go work with. Blue of Minnesota has a really big incubator program that they'll try just about anybody. Florida Blue used to be fairly innovative. I know they're cutting back on expenses. I think in the market, entrants undervalue how long the sales cycle is and how hard it is to get a technical integration done. By hard, I don't mean connecting to the program. I mean getting the resources prioritized to get connected.

If it were me going into a space and I had this really cool widget or I know what it could do, I would be looking at the scrap heap of companies that are financially tapped out and trying to find who has a contract with Kaiser or with Blue of Arizona. I don't care what I'm buying. I'm buying the contract and I'm buying the integration that's already built. That's where I would be dedicating all of my resources because I do partnerships and I want to be careful with how I say this, but the time from getting a customer to nod their head and say, "Yes, I want it," to "I'm actually using it," is at least a year.

If you're trying to help a client, it would be find somebody that's got an integration you can work with. It has a contract that will let you do the work and sidestep all the procurement committees and vendor risk assessments and all the other crap.

**Client:** That's helpful. Awesome. I really appreciate you taking the time. This has been super helpful.
