Scientific progress has long driven human flourishing, extending lifespans, lifting billions from poverty, and expanding our understanding of the universe.

But history is littered with transformational ideas that were overlooked in their time.

Astronomer Vera Rubin’s galaxy‑rotation measurements were doubted for years, yet they revealed the invisible “dark matter” that dominates the cosmos. Mathematician Alan Turing’s vision for a universal computing machine was long ignored, only to become the cornerstone of computer science. Biochemist Katalin Karikó’s insistence that a strand of mRNA could teach our cells to make immunity-producing proteins was dismissed, until the technique produced the world’s first COVID vaccines and won her a Nobel Prize.

Time after time, traditional research institutions have failed to nurture our brightest minds, overlooking breakthroughs or failing to convert them into real-world impact. That has meant massive missed opportunities for humanity – and it continues to happen today. Brilliant scientists around the world are still stuck in outdated systems that are holding them back.

It’s time for a better way.

**Today, we’re announcing [Episteme](http://episteme.com), a new type of research and development company that recruits exceptional scientists to pursue high-impact ideas** that have languished in traditional institutions. By supporting the right people with the right incentives, we’re set to generate breakthrough discoveries to benefit humanity, while building enduring businesses and a new system for how science is done.

Typically, researchers rely on universities to fund their work, and on industry to commercialize it. But academia is notoriously risk-averse. Tenure committees, grant panels, and journal reviewers prefer safe, incremental projects that promise publishable results, and drastic federal funding cuts have only made them more conservative. Industry, meanwhile, is too focused on short‑term incentives, shelving projects that don’t boost quarterly profits. And startups usually lack the substantial capital, expertise, and complex infrastructure needed to deliver long-term scientific progress.

Too much promising talent remains unsupported, and brilliant ideas fade in the lab without benefitting the world.

Inspired by some of history’s most productive research environments – like Bell Labs, the Institute for Advanced Study, or Xerox PARC – we are creating a third path for science, bringing together leading scientists in-house and providing the funding and operational support to help them develop and deploy their breakthroughs in the world.

We take our name, *Episteme*, from the Greek word for “knowledge,” which has evolved to describe the system of ideas that shape the intellectual conscience of an era. An *episteme* defines how knowledge is produced at a given moment in history, and how that in turn frames what we think. Five centuries ago, the world agreed that the Sun circled Earth – until Copernicus proved otherwise, unlocking new lines of inquiry and understanding. His work shifted the *episteme* of that era. We are working to shift the *episteme* of ours.

We believe that we can’t just wait for a new episteme to emerge; we have to shape it. We actively intervene and build momentum behind the overlooked thinkers who can help change what the world sees as possible.

Just as the Medici supported Renaissance polymaths who rewrote the rules of art, science, and philosophy, and just as Cold War programs like ARPA catalyzed revolutions in computing, materials science, and space exploration, we intentionally back visionaries pursuing high-potential ideas that today’s system filters out – for being too cross-disciplinary, too speculative, too difficult to translate.

We focus on interdisciplinary research in areas across physics, biology, and engineering where accelerating progress by even a few years could have profound human impact – for example by producing fusion technology for abundant clean energy; in computational neuroscience, to restore people’s ability to move and speak; in advanced computing to speed the discovery of life-saving treatments and novel materials; and more.

**Belief in people is our fundamental currency.** We not only consider each researcher’s science and technical talent, but also the human being behind it all. We invest in them, not just in one of their ideas.

In the last two years, we’ve spoken to hundreds of scientists and engineers around the world to learn more about the constraints on their work. We’ve built Episteme for them.

We work backwards from the researcher, providing each with funding and operational support tailored to their needs, from the seeds of an idea through commercialization. We all work together under one roof, building community and benefitting from the kind of daily collisions across disciplines that yield new ways of thinking.

People can do so much more than the current system of scientific production allows. Every minute of delay means cures undiscovered and breakthrough technologies postponed. Episteme is dedicated to maximizing the potential and impact of the world’s brightest researchers – and in the process, transforming industries, saving lives, and helping to reshape the world’s understanding of what’s possible.
