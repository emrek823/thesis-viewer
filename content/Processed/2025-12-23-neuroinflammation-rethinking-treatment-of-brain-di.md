# Introduction

Over the past few decades, few therapeutic areas have drawn as much skepticism across biopharma, research, and investment circles as **neurology**.

When looking at the numbers, this hesitation may be warranted. The average probability of a central nervous system (CNS) drug making it from Phase I to market is just [5.9%](https://www.bio.org/clinical-development-success-rates-and-contributing-factors-2011-2020) — the 4th lowest by therapeutic area (TA). The average time to approval is [11.1 years](https://www.bio.org/clinical-development-success-rates-and-contributing-factors-2011-2020) — the 3rd longest by TA. Moreover, unlike other indication spaces such as oncology and immunological diseases, **the pace of new drug approvals in CNS has been relatively [stagnant over the last 3 decades](https://www.crai.com/insights-events/publications/approaching-the-final-frontier-are-we-in-a-golden-decade-of-drug-development-for-the-central-nervous-system/)**.

This reality is most visible in neurodegenerative diseases such as **Alzheimer’s** and **Parkinson’s**. For decades, the dominant therapeutic approach has focused on [eliminating the hallmark protein aggregates](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0235-9) (e.g. amyloid beta (Aβ), tau, α-synuclein) thought to drive disease progression. Yet in the last five years, this hypothesis has been at the center of high-profile article [retractions](https://www.science.org/content/article/researchers-plan-retract-landmark-alzheimers-paper-containing-doctored-images), numerous clinical trial [failures](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/roches-anti-amyloid-antibody-gantenerumab-fails-phase-3-alzheimers-trials), controversial drug [approvals](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2212948), and subsequent [discontinuations](https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/treatments/aducanumab).

Today, despite decades of effort, **only [two disease-modifying therapies](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41573-024-00116-1) targeting protein aggregation are approved for Alzheimer’s**. While these approvals suggest protein aggregation remains an important piece of the therapeutic puzzle, their overall [cognitive benefits are modest](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2212948), and their use is further clouded by [characteristic safety issues](https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/eli-lilly-kisunla-wins-fda-nod-new-dosing-fewer-brain-side-effects-alzheimers-disease) that can prevent long-term adherence. Moreover, there are still **no approved disease-modifying treatments for Parkinson’s**.

Given these data, it’s easy for many outside the neuro field to develop a negative gut reaction surrounding the future of CNS drug development. I’ll be the first to admit that even as someone who dabbled in neuro research as a wet-lab scientist, there was a large part of me that felt this way too. But after spending more time diving deeper into the field’s history and emerging biological hypotheses, my perspective has shifted.

Through the lens of an **initial skeptic turned hesitant optimist**, this article explores why neurology drug development has been so difficult, how CNS investment by pharma and venture capital (VC) has evolved over time, and one emerging therapeutic hypothesis that could catalyze the development of novel disease-modifying therapeutics.

# **Why should biotech, pharma, and VC be investing in neuro research?**

From a **scientific and human health perspective**, advancing our understanding of fundamental neurobiology and using that knowledge to develop treatments for CNS disorders is undoubtedly valuable to society.

However, from an **investment standpoint** — across biotech, biopharma, and VC — the prioritization of neurology can become less clear. With limited resources, investors and drug developers are forced to weigh which indications and therapeutic hypotheses should be prioritized, whether fundamental biological insights are mature enough to translate into clinical therapies, and if the field is at the right point on the [technological J-curve](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/j-curve-effect.asp) to encourage investment.

In the current risk-off market, biotech investors and biopharma often favor indication areas with high probabilities of clinical success, relatively fast development timelines, and large market potential. As noted above, CNS disorders have historically scored poorly on the first two measures, which can explain some of the **disproportionate deprioritization** of this space.

But the scale of the market opportunity and the substantial burden CNS disorders have on patients and broader society are significant, and there is increasing evidence that **the market is growing out of an [over decade-long slump](https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/analyst-comment/cns-market-resurgence/?cf-view)**. Specifically, the broader CNS market is [poised to surpass $80B in 2025](https://www.globaldata.com/media/pharma/cns-market-to-surpass-80-billion-in-2025-driven-by-ms-and-psychiatric-drug-innovation-says-globaldata/), corresponding to an **~8% year-over-year growth**.

Perhaps even more striking is the socioeconomic burden. **CNS disorders are the [leading cause of overall disease burden worldwide](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422(24)00038-3/fulltext).** Collectively, they affect [43% of the global population and are responsible for 443M disability-adjusted life years (DALYs)](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422(24)00038-3/fulltext) — an increase of 18.2% over the last 30+ years. To put this into context, in 2019, it was estimated that early-onset cancers account for [~250M DALYs globally](https://ehoonline.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40164-025-00634-7).

Between a growing market, massive socioeconomic impact, and heavy burden on patients, **the question isn’t whether opportunity exists in CNS, it’s which catalysts can overcome the field’s unique developmental challenges, accelerate the approval of disease-modifying therapies, and spark broad investor interest**.

# **Why is CNS drug development so difficult?**

For many CNS disorders, current **standard-of-care (SoC) therapies are decades old** and often only manage symptoms. For example, in Parkinson’s disease, the dopamine precursor [levodopa/carbidopa (Sinemet) has remained SoC](https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000012868) since its approval in 1975, providing relief of motor symptoms but without altering disease progression. Similarly, propranolol, a nonselective beta blocker originally approved in 1967, is the [only FDA-approved treatment for essential tremor](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3873223/).

Progress in CNS drug development has generally been slow because the brain poses a unique set of **scientific, clinical, and logistical challenges** that make drug development significantly more complex than most other indication areas:

1. **Our fundamental understanding of neurobiology is limited compared to other tissues.**

   The CNS is arguably our most complex organ system, comprising [billions of neurons with trillions of dynamic connections](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4689008/). Access to human tissue is scarce and tools for non-invasively measuring and manipulating its function are limited. This is further compounded by a lack of representative *in vitro* and *in vivo* preclinical models to study complex disease phenotypes that are often driven by several cell types — making novel target discovery and validation of new therapeutic hypotheses even more difficult.
2. **CNS tissue has limited regenerative capacity.**

   Because mature neurons are post-mitotic, damage from disease or injury is often permanent. This limits the potential for reversing late-stage disease and focuses most therapies toward only slowing progression. Moreover, many CNS diseases do not present symptoms until irreversible damage has already occurred, complicating overall treatment strategies.
3. **Clinical trials for CNS disorders are challenging to execute.**

   CNS diseases are heterogeneous and vary significantly across patients due to differences in genetic and environmental causes. As a result, there are relatively few reliable biomarkers that clearly link target engagement to clinical outcomes. Long disease courses and strict inclusion criteria make trials especially lengthy and expensive.
4. **The blood-brain barrier (BBB) selectively limits drug delivery to the brain.**

   The BBB is a protective barrier of several cell types — most notably endothelial cells — and extracellular matrix that limit the passage of soluble molecules and cells between the peripheral circulatory system and CNS tissue. It’s estimated that only [2% of FDA-approved small molecules](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4064947/) and [<1% of an IV administered antibody dose](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2022.958543/full) cross the BBB. Researchers are working on both passive and active methods of drug delivery across the BBB, but our understanding of the optimal design heuristics is limited.

# **How has CNS investment interest by pharma and VC evolved over time?**

After decades of searching, pharma finally found its initial breakout class of neurology drugs in the late 1980s with the **[FDA approval of Eli Lilly’s Prozac](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/freud-fluoxetine/202003/the-story-prozac-landmark-drug-in-psychiatry)**, a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI) for treatment of major depression. By 1990, **Prozac became the** [best-selling antidepressant of all time](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/freud-fluoxetine/202003/the-story-prozac-landmark-drug-in-psychiatry), and by 1998, it reached $2.8B in annual sales, accounting for [a quarter of all Eli Lilly's revenue](https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2001/0430/072.html).

Several factors contributed to Prozac’s widespread success, including its relatively safe toxicity profile, convenient once-daily oral dosing, broad potential for indication expansion, and overall cultural resonance. But perhaps the most important factor for the neuro field at large was the **breakthrough in validation of a new therapeutic hypothesis** delivering clear efficacy and safety benefit to patients.

**This novel biology sparked a wave of interest and investment across pharma** — several developing their own “me-too” SSRIs, including [Pfizer’s Zoloft in 1991](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sertraline) and [GSK’s Paxil in 1992](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paroxetine). Zoloft’s sales would ultimately go on to eclipse Prozac’s with a [peak of >$3B in 2004](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB115154467879893805). Soon after, the field expanded to related biological mechanisms, including serotonin-norepinephrine re-uptake inhibitors (SNRIs) such as [Wyeth/Pfizer’s Effexor (1993)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venlafaxine) and [Eli Lilly’s Cymbalta (2004)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duloxetine).

However, by the mid-2000s, **the market began to shift**. The SSRI/SNRI space had grown increasingly crowded, and several early drugs [lost patent protection](https://www.forbes.com/2000/08/16/mu4.html), opening the door for generics to capture significant market share. Outside of psychiatry, the challenges
