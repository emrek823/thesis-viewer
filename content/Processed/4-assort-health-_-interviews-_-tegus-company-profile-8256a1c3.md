# Assort Health - Vice President of Strategy at Shared Practices Group

Interview conducted on July 07, 2025

## Topics
AI, Call Centers, Practice Management Software, Integrations, Healthcare, Customer Service, Patient Engagement, Patient Calls

## Summary
A vice president of strategy for Shared Practices Group faced challenges with their call center operations, such as high costs, low conversion rates, and missed calls. They chose Assort Health over Hello Patient due to customization, flexible contracts, and software integration. By using Assort Health, they increased new patient conversions, reduced missed opportunities, and lowered the cost per call. They rate Assort Health at eight and a half out of ten, emphasize integrations and custom solutions, and prefer Hyro over Hello Patient. Pricing and additional capabilities like payment processing and analytics could influence a potential switch from Assort Health, especially with the pressure from cheaper alternatives like Dentina.

**Q: Please briefly describe your experience with AI tools used for inbound calls and customer service.**
A: We analyzed different options back in Q2 2024 (Assort Health, Infinitus, Hello Patient, and Hyro), and we piloted Assort in Q3 2024, then rolled it out fully on Q4 2024. There were some kinks in onboarding but we've achieve a very positive ROI in reducing cost per call, increasing answer rate.

**Q: Do you currently use any AI tools to automate inbound calls and/or customer service? Please list any you use or have evaluated.**
A: Assort Health.

## Client
Hi. Thank you for taking the time to speak with me. I am doing some research on startups in the healthcare and AI space, using voice for customer service, scheduling, patient engagement, things like that. That's what we'll be talking about today. Just to get started, it'd be great to hear your background, your role today.

## Expert
My background is, I've been in dentistry for about 15 years, role would be vice president of strategy for Shared Practices Group. We are a dental implants, full-arch dental chain, and that we have about 36 locations across the country in different markets. That's my background.

## Client
Great. To confirm, you are a customer of Assort Health?

## Expert
Yes, that's correct.

## Client
Excellent. Can you describe how you're using them today?

## Expert
Yeah. We are using them to answer all our existing patient calls as well as every call that gets to the fourth ring there to answer that as well.

## Client
Great. Could you describe those use cases in as much detail as possible, just so we're fully understanding how you're using Assort?

## Expert
Okay. When we were looking for a solution, we were trying to fix four problems. One, our cost per call was very, very high. We have agents in the U.S. as well as agents overseas. In order to answer, we had a remote call center and our cost per call was about $8 per call. That was cost prohibitive, that is, we scaled. Not to mention, it was driving our customer acquisition costs way up, and we were looking for ways to reduce that. That's problem number one.

Problem number two was that only our U.S. schedulers are highly skilled and they have the highest conversion rate, but only 15% of their time or 15% of their calls was being spent on, what we call, high-value opportunities. That'd be new potential patients calling instead of existing patients. Once they're existing, you're already at their dental office. They're lower value calls versus someone who's still shopping around and trying to figure out who they're going to go to.

We wanted to be able to have our highly skilled converters spend more time talking to the high-value calls. That was problem number two. Problem number three is that despite having so many agents, we had about 13 U.S. agents and 25 overseas agents, we were still missing about 13% of all calls because in our numbers, if you don't answer the phone by the fourth ring, 98% of the time, the patient will hang up before getting to voicemail.

## Client
To jump in real quick, was that you're missing 13% or 30% of calls?

## Expert
Thirteen. You have to answer by the fourth ring. The way that call centers work is that calls come in in waves. Even though we were highly staffed, it's impossible to staff at the very, very peak. Even if you do, that's cost prohibitive because then there's all this downtime where you're paying people to sit around. We already had the cost per call as a problem. We were trying to figure out how do we get it out to 0% missed in a cost without raising our cost per call. That was the third problem we were trying to fix.

We started looking around the different options, AI. This is Q1, 2024. It was before this AI agent boom happened. This was still not in the news as much. There wasn't as much buzz around this kind of solutions. We looked into Hyro. We looked to Hello Patient. We looked into Assort. We looked into Infinitus, I think that's what it's called. We came up with a list of criterias that we were selecting for, and we called each of them, we divided out the work between us and asked them those questions.

As a group, we all came up with the answer to be Assort. Although I did have key decision-making power, I don't want to use it unless I have to, and that was a group decision. We piloted Q2 last year. Those are the problems we were trying to solve. When you say use cases, I think that's what you mean. How we went about solving them, I can get into that as well.

## Client
Yeah. Just to summarize the problems you were facing, your best agents were spending too much time on low-value tasks, and then it became too expensive to hire them. Assort helped to solve those problems. You mentioned, I think you had 13 U.S.-based agents and 25 international ones. Have you adjusted those numbers? Have you cut those down with Assort?

## Expert
Yeah. We are up in U.S. agents to somewhere over 13. We're down in overseas agents to somewhere under 10, so we've got somewhere under 25 overseas.

## Client
Great. Just to build off your last answer, could you talk in detail why exactly Assort Health won over Hello Patient?

## Expert
Sure. The criterias we were looking for, one, we wanted them to be willing to customize their solution. We felt like our use cases were pretty unique and we wanted to know, because this is a new space, all their products is new, "Could you build custom solutions for us depending on our needs or are we basically having to work within the confinements of your current product?" Assort was the only one that really was willing to do anything pretty much to keep our business.

They were pretty clear that we would be their biggest customer. They were like, "Yeah. Whatever we have to build," and they built custom solutions for us that they now offer to everyone. That was one of the criterias and they were one of the only ones that wanted it. The other thing was they'd have to be willing to do a month-to-month pilot until the solution was proven. We were happy with the long-term agreement but not before the pilot. Assort was willing to do whatever worked for us, where the other ones were a little more strict on the pilot contract lengths.

Hello Patient wanted a six-month pilot contract, when we only wanted to do a quarter. We didn't see why we'd have to pay another three months. They weren't very flexible on the contract terms. We also had a criteria for the quality of the AI scheduling agent. To be honest, I think they're all going to tell you they have the best quality and they're all going to send you great sounding calls, but you don't really know who has the best until you start using them.

I believe they're all pretty similar when it comes to the actual quality of the agent or the AI itself. It's more so the capabilities of it. What can you do and what can you not do in terms of functions? That's where Assort also stood out because they were already in dental and they already had integration with their practice management software that they had built.

They were able to basically read and write right into the software, schedule appointments. The other ones, like Hello Patient, had their own scheduling platform that we had to go off of. It was just adding more complexity to the front desk, where Assort, if they didn't have the integrations, they were willing to build it.

Since they did, that just made things easier. Those were the criterias that we had.

How we went about fixing those four problems was, one, we first started with, we had to figure out a way to triage calls. In the past, we used phone trees, but they're not very accurate. To be fair, none of the methods are extremely accurate, but phone trees are only accurate about 60% of the time because a lot of people just press one because they know they'll get someone on the phone if they say they're new patients. Not always were they new patients.

The phone trees also give the feeling that you're calling a big call center. We were trying to stay with the look and feel of a neighborhood clinic, so that accounted against our brand. What they built for us was a phone lookup feature where when the phone call comes in, you take the phone number it's calling from, look up at our database. If it's a recognized patient number, then it will flag it as an existing patient call. You route the call based on a different logic. If it's an unrecognized number, you flag it as a potential new patient, and then that will flag the call in a different routing path.

It allowed us to set a different routing path based on recognized or unrecognized number. That changed everything because we then said, "Okay, for every recognized number, for sure they're an existing patient, because they wouldn't be in our system otherwise. All recognized numbers go straight to the AI and let's take all of that workload off of the U.S. agents." The U.S. agents weren't in line at all to handle any existing patients and that cut down their busy work significantly, and allowed us to have them focus on just potential new business opportunities or new patients.

They went from answering 15% of their calls, 15% or 20% of their calls were new patient opportunities or high-value calls, to somewhere over 50%. That also helped us decrease the missed opportunities, the 13% down because now we had more U.S. agents that were on queue for people who were unrecognized phone numbers. Our conversion rate also improved. They were converting somewhere over 50%. Anytime they did get a new patient call, they converted somewhere over 50% into appointments, and it went up to somewhere over 65%.

I think that's just because once they started doing the same type of calls more often, they just got more proficient. The combination of all that led to us increasing our new patients by somewhere over 8% across the board. We were now seeing more new patients than we were seeing before, by converting more and by answering more and by having the U.S. agents focus on those high-value calls.

We also have the AI answer the phone, no matter if it's recognized or unrecognized by the fourth ring. That cut down the abandon call rate to zero, because again, if you don't answer by the fourth ring, there's a 97% chance they're going to hang up before getting to voicemail. Now the AI answers it, and as a result, we also were able to get rid of somewhere over 10 agents from overseas, and that cut our cost.

Even with the cost of Assort, that cut our cost per call down from $8 to somewhere under $7 now, which still a little bit high. The U.S. agent still has some capacity left. Once we maximize the current U.S. load, we'll probably be at somewhere under $5 and we want it to be below $5. We feel like that's scalable, and still we're able to fix that as well. We did a pilot for about a quarter.

## Client
That was around this time, last year?

## Expert
Yeah, it was Q2 last year that we did the pilot. Now, one thing that I will say about Assort that, to be fair to them, they did warn us that they were brand new and that they were still putting the team together. They told us to be patient with their onboarding. Even with them telling us that, I felt like onboarding was really, really disorganized.

It took way too long. I'm pretty sure they probably fixed that now as a company, but that was our experience, because we wanted to be live with all practices by Q3 and they weren't able to make that happen just because of lack of customer success people.

## Client
It sounds like you went live with them throughout Q3 and Q4, correct?

## Expert
Q4 was when we went live with them.

## Client
If you were going to give Assort Health a product score, on a scale of 1-10, one being hate and 10 being love, what product score would you give it today and why?

## Expert
Product score? I'd say, an eight and a half.

## Client
Are they doing any outbound calling efforts for you?

## Expert
No.

## Client
Do you know if they can even technically do that as part of their product?

## Expert
I haven't asked. We don't have a lot of outbound needs. We do, but we leave it to the treatment coordinator at each office because they've built a relationship with the patient. We just don't see AI being able to help with that.

## Client
I wasn't sure with bill pay or anything like that?

## Expert
Yeah. In our case, we're just not a big deliverer in an other clients or they may offer in their products. We haven't asked.

## Client
Was there anything that you liked about Hello Patient when you did the pilot with them?

## Expert
Yeah. I think their products are pretty similar. I think it's more about, they have the integrations, and so on. I think Hyro, I liked it a little bit better than Hello Patient in terms of the integrations, and they were willing to integrate with our practice management software, where Hello Patient was like, "We're going to have a separate schedule and you have to transfer the appointments to your practice management software."

You're just going to add an extra step. To be honest with you, I think that Assort was pretty clear as meeting most of our needs. Hello Patient or Hyro, I don't think I would have been happy with them. It's not so much the product quality as much as integrations, and them also building custom solutions for us.

## Client
Do you know if any of your peers have evaluated Hello Patient?

## Expert
I don't. I can tell you in dental right now, most of the attention is going towards dental-specific scheduling agents. There are companies that are, like Dentina AI is one of them, where they're coming in and saying, "We're dental-specific." That's what you see at shows, at conferences. I know people who use them, but I don't know anyone who's used Hello Patient or any of the other ones I mentioned.

## Client
Okay. When you're at shows and Dentina is being talked about or even the company is presenting, what are they doing that's dental-specific, that's different than Assort Health?

## Expert
Honestly, a lot of it's just branding, just branding themselves as dental-specific. I don't think that there's a difference too much on the quality of the calls. One thing is the integrations with different practice management software, so already having those, for being dental-specific, really helps.

In terms of answering a phone call, I don't really think it matters. That's why we haven't really switched to any dental-specific ones since working with Assort because we don't think it really matters whether you're dental-specific or not, but a prospective customer in dental does think it matters. It's just brand positioning and marketing.

## Client
Is there anything that a new provider could offer you that would get you to change away from Assort Health?

## Expert
Yeah. I think pricing is one. Assort Health compared to Dentina, there's a pretty significant price difference. I'm getting pressure from some people in the company to consider, or at least, pilot Dentina because of that price difference. Assort is significantly 40% higher at the moment. If you don't look at pricing, and you just look at the quality and the capabilities, one thing that Assort is not currently doing is taking payments over the phone.

When existing patients are calling to make payments, they're just transferring that to the front desk or taking a message and then we call them back later. I don't see why the AI can't process a payment. That's a capability that they're missing. I'll say the other thing that I wish they had is, they do have a dashboard with analytics, but they're only analyzing. The patient can press nine anytime to go and get transferred to one of our offices.

It tells us how often that's happening. It's happening about 15% of the time, which we're actually pretty happy with. It shows sentiment and how the AI responded to different things. I feel like they could extend that to all our calls, regardless of it's answered by the AI or answered by a real person because right now we pay another software to give us that kind of feedback.

It's expensive. If Assort is already doing that for AI calls, they could easily do the same thing for all calls, and then charge us a little bit more. We'd save on not having to pay the other company. That's another thing that I've shared with them and that I wish they did.

## Client
Is there a rough range of how much you're paying for Assort today?

## Expert
Yeah. It comes down to somewhere under $900 a month per practice. It's not a monthly fee. I don't know if they do this with everyone, because at first, they wanted to charge us a pure flat cost per call or price per call. I pushed back. I don't think they had their pricing figured out at that point. I pushed back because to me, it's like a price-per-call model doesn't work because I'm not hiring labor. It's a software.

They were like, "Look, you're paying $8 a call. We'll charge you somewhere under $4 a call. You're going to save a ton of money." I was like, "Yeah, but that's still a lot for software." We agreed on somewhere under $600 a month per office. That gave us a bank of phone calls, not minutes, but phone calls. I don't remember exactly what that bank is, and that's per practice.

At the end of the quarter, we want cost predictability, we don't want it to be $10,000 one month, and then $12,000 next month. We want it to be predictable so we can budget. We do under $600 a month per office. In the end of the quarter, if we go over the allotted number of calls, then we will pay for the overage at under $4 a call. If you looked at Q3 last year, when we did the math, it came down to about somewhere under $900 per office.

## Client
Sorry to intervene. That's a lot of detail on the pricing. I think we're just asking roughly what does that come to as a ballpark range on an annual basis.

## Expert
Okay. Somewhere under $900 per office a month, and we have 36 offices.

## Client
Okay. All good on my end.

## Expert
Just to give you an idea of the price difference, because you asked about switching. Dentina, right now, would've cost us somewhere under $500 per month. They're significantly cheaper. They have the same integrations. They don't have the phone lookup feature, but they said they would build it. You can see there is a huge price difference now that's putting a lot of pressure on us to switch, or at least test it out.

## Client
Got it. Thank you for your time today. Have a good one.
