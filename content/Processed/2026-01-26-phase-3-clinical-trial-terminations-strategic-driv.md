## Epistemic AI Analysis Reveals Strategic Business Decisions as the Leading Driver of Phase 3 Clinical Trial Terminations

[Press Release](#)

January 7, 2026

#### Phase 3 trial terminations are rising, and strategic decisions now outpace scientific causes.

A new study in [*Nature Reviews Drug Discovery*](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41573-025-00208-6) analyzes 3,180 terminated Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials (2013–2023). The authors find that late-stage terminations doubled over the past decade, while operational and safety issues stayed relatively stable.

The analysis was conducted using [EpistemicGPT](https://www.epistemic.ai/platform) and the Epistemic Knowledge Graph to map trial outcomes and termination reasons at scale. The biggest shift is the rise of strategic and business drivers—portfolio reprioritization, M&A, and commercial strategy—now the most frequent causes of late‑stage termination. The pattern suggests that organizations are ending programs for business alignment rather than new scientific evidence.

#### Key takeaways

* Late‑stage (Phase 2/3) terminations doubled from ~11% to ~22% across the decade.
* Strategic and business factors now outpace clinical efficacy as termination drivers.
* Earlier decision points could reduce sunk costs in Phase 3 development.

#### Why it matters

Phase 3 trials are costly and slow. Understanding why programs end can help teams rebalance resources earlier, reduce late‑stage losses, and align development plans with real‑world business constraints.

#### FAQ

**Q:** Why are Phase 3 terminations increasing?  
**A:** Driven primarily by business strategy (portfolio shifts/market changes) rather than drug performance.

**Q:** What is the financial impact?  
**A:** Lost investments often exceeding $50M–$500M per asset.
