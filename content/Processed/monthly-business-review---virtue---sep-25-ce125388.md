# Pipeline

## Slide 7: Sep - Customer conversation updates

# Sep - Customer conversation updates
Overview: 30 customer prospect convos logged

**Highlights**

1.  **Implementation momentum & active usage:** Cardinal: Okta SSO issues resolved; soft launch lined up; Slack/Teams connection and small UX tweaks queued; onsite Oct 9-10. Beacon Biosignals: Daily engagement; pushing FedEx testing + webhook save; selecting first site for branded notifications.
2.  **Strong pull for white-label + AI interventions + control tower:** AI voice/email consistently resonated (DSS, Minaris, Generate Bio, ALK, Pfizer); rapid rollout and "sensor-agnostic” approach seen as differentiators. Control tower demand emerging at enterprise scale (e.g., Alnylam wants a 6-month plan; AbbVie wants excursion triage + comms automation). Device/sensor agnosticism valued by Emball'ISO (customer portal) and Testo (partner route).
3.  **Enterprise pipeline depth & channels.** Engaged pharma logos: Pfizer, AbbVie, Alexion/AZ, Alnylam, BMS, Organon, J&J, Takeda, ALK, Aurobindo, Immunome (plus Minaris CGT). 3PLs/Channels: Cencora/World Courier aligning intros (Customer Service), Uniphar collaborating around Beacon; Advisory/partners: Accenture and PwC validating pain (multi-portal, last-mile gap) and opening intro threads.

**Lowlights**

1.  **ROI/volume sensitivity slows smaller orgs:** Rhea Fertility, Harm Reduction Therapeutics: low volumes → not near-term priority; Aurobindo highly price-sensitive generics.
2.  **Decision latency & internal bandwidth:** Accenture deep dive rescheduled; several "need to schedule intro/demo" threads across enterprise accounts.

**Key quotes**
*   "That was AI? She sounded real." — COO, Donor Support Staff (DSS)
*   "The AI voice is very realistic." — VP Supply Chain, Minaris
*   "I don't want to log into multiple portals." — Accenture
*   "It doesn't look good to not know where your stuff is." — Verily
*   "We get 'five-alarm fire' situations unnecessarily." — AbbVie

## Slide 12: ICP / Market segmentation

# ICP / Market segmentation
Latest updates

**ICP characteristics (ranked)**
1.  Excited about new tech, driving change (early adopter)
2.  High shipment value (>$1k/shipment)
3.  High volume (50+/mo; ideally 200+/mo)
4.  Value role-based visibility + branded tracking (Frequent "Where is my shipment?" inquiries)
5.  High ops inefficiency: spreadsheets / many portals
6.  Multi-carrier and cross-border flows
7.  High compliance tracking needs (GDP, 21 CFR Part 11, HIPAA)
8.  Suffered shipment losses (anecdotal), and not OK with it

**Shipment volume / Shipment value Matrix**

| | $1k+ Shipment value |
| :----------------------- | :----------------------- |
| **50 / mo Shipment volume** | **Cardinal** <br> Distributor <br> Pharma <br> Specialty Pharma |
| **Diagnostics Labs** | **Beacon Bio** <br> CDMO <br> Biotech Stage 2+ <br> Biotech Stage 1 |

**Shift since seed round**
**Higher importance than initially expected**
*   Your brand extends to shipment delivery + role-based visibility access
*   Risk detection → Intervention (AI) with drill-down

**Less importance than initially expected**
*   Loss reduction as primary ROI lever (more for Pharma, CDMOs – require proof points)
*   Live sensor measurement requirements (general trend towards reducing cost vs. additional measurements)
