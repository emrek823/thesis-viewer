### Deal Status Update

- TICAP exclusivity period ending - likely pulling term sheet
- Jared spooked by co-founder dynamics
- Price resistance: Todd and Mike like deal at $50M, not at $70M
- Process has been “atrocious” and “out of left field”
- Decision expected tomorrow or day after

### Current Position

- Out of exclusivity now
- Not adjusting on price or timeline
- Emre communicated: “This is it” - no negotiation on terms
- IC trip warned against if price/reorganization are blockers

### Strategic Decision

- Consensus: Build business for next 3 months instead of shopping deal
	- Get Anna’s numbers stronger for better traction
	- Develop Blueprint beyond concept stage
	- Clean up organizational chart/team structure
- Timeline: 6-9 month fundraising delay recommended
- Need to trim OpEx to extend runway

### Business Development Focus

- Blueprint received “amazing feedback” but needs execution
	- Hire leadership team
	- Demonstrate 1-2 operational concepts
- Anna growth metrics continue strong trajectory
- Fire under them: Use rejection as motivation to prove TICAP wrong

### Portfolio Implications

- Will not recommend TICAP to any portfolio companies
- Plan to disclose poor process behavior to companies considering TICAP engagement
- Expectation they’ll encounter TICAP at JPM conference
