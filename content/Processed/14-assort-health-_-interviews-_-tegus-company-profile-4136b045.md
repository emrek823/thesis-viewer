**Q: Provide an example of how you use or have used this product and how it relates to your current or previous position.**
A: We are using this product to help improve efficiency in our call center and achieve better KPIs.
I have a good relationship with them. They are very much interested in working with us because we are their first retina practice.

**Client**
Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today about AI solutions within healthcare, companies like Assort Health. To start off, could you please give me a quick overview of your background and experience?

**Expert**
Sure. I'm the Chief Administrative Officer for Retina Associates of Northern California. We are a six-location, seven-physician retina-specific practice. We have about 45,000 appointments a year and we employ about 75 people in total, including our seven physicians. I've been with the organization for the past five years. I really took an interest in AI as a tool over the past year, year and a half when looking at how we can continue to meet the demands of our practice, scale up, but also deal with some macroeconomic challenges of lower reimbursements, higher staffing costs, challenges with staffing as well too when remaining competitive in our landscape.

The way I look at AI is when I review all of our operations, I look to see where are action items that we take or processes that we have or things that are repetitive in nature, administrative, something that you think that a robot could do, technically. Now, I think in this stage of AI development, there definitely are areas in operations that a robot can do.

Particularly, we've been working with a few AI tools in specific areas right now. We're looking to include it in two to three more areas as well too. Those two specific areas are we make a lot of phone calls to insurance companies to verify patient's eligibility because these insurance companies don't have portal access. What we had identified is that our eligibility team needs to spend about six hours a day almost just to verify eligibility for up to six patients. It takes about an hour a day.

We worked with this group called Delfina AI to make those phone calls on our behalf, extract the information that's necessary, and have it just be reviewed by eligibility team. We're working with Assort Health as a voice agent as part of our call center. We developed a call center about a year ago and looked to staff it with humans. We thought that ideally, three humans would be able to manage the 10,000 or so calls we get a month. We've continuously found challenges in keeping it staffed adequately, dealing with call outs, having to train people. That's actually three is not enough for our call center.

About six to eight months ago when I was at athenahealth conference, athenahealth is our practice management system. I came across Assort Health and at that time, they seemed to be the only voice agent that connected with athenahealth. Their focus was on a call center agent. They had already implemented it in a few orthopedic practices. We were their first retina practice. Although there are some similarities, we've got to work with them on training their bot to be able to manage the specific use case scenarios in a retina practice.

We just launched with them full-time about almost two weeks ago. Their focus is on capturing and answering calls related to patients who have scheduling-related calls. We identified about 50% of our 10,000 calls a month happen to be around these, whether it's a patient confirming their appointment, rescheduling or canceling their appointment. That's what Assort Health focuses on, while the other calls that would get routed more specifically to based off of the caller's preference. I'll stop there.

**Client**
Super helpful. A lot to dig into there. First of all, could you give us a sense of the rough size and revenue scale of your company?

---

**Expert**
Yes. We're about a $50 million a year company and in terms of size, like I said, we're six locations, seven physicians. We have about a patient panel of 12,000 active patients and we do about 45,000 appointments a year. We have 75 employees in total. That includes the seven physicians. Excluding them, there's about 68 employees.

**Client**
Great. Next, just on the call center use case for Assort Health, could you walk us through some of the common things the call center is used for?

**Expert**
Ideally, our call center is the epicenter of all calls coming into the practice. They're supposed to answer the call and redirect the call if it's a call pertaining to our research department or billing department or to take a message. If it's a call for new patient referral or patient scheduling, our call center team is supposed to be able to manage that but like I was saying, they weren't quite able to handle the volume.

When I was looking at how do I increase the capability of the call center to be able to answer our volume, I was looking at either hiring more people or potentially using AI voice agent. I was impressed with what Assort Health AI agent sounded like and was capable of doing. We decided to implement that because at the price of Assort Health, it allows me to scale further without having to hire more people necessarily in the short run than if I didn't use Assort Health.

**Client**
Super helpful. To be clear, if there's a patient coming in to schedule and they call, it goes to the call center, is Assort Health voice agent able to end-to-end schedule them or at some point does a human need to be in the loop?

**Expert**
Yes, end-to-end. Basically, what we did was instead of having a person answer the call, as soon as a person calls, they get a phone tree to triage the call. The phone tree gives options. If the person presses one, that's usually for new patient referral. We still have that go to live operator and we get about 400 of those types of calls. We book about 400 appointments a month through that. We're probably getting anywhere from 500 to more calls around that.

If the person presses two, that's for scheduling and that's where it goes to Assort Health. At that point, Assort Health is able to fully take care of that call from end-to-end, unless it has to do with that is research-related. We indicate that if you're calling for a research appointment, press three, that goes for our research department. If the person still presses two and Assort Health identifies that it's a research appointment that they're trying to reschedule, it will send them to a live person in research, only because there's specific protocols around that.

If a person is trying to make an appointment without having a referral, it will redirect that call to our live operator because we need to first seek out that referral information from a referring office. All other appointment types of calls patient wants to, if an established patient wants to make an appointment, we've been able to teach Assort Health to follow the algorithms that are a normal person, a live human would follow in determining when and where that appointment can be made.

If it's a patient that would like to reschedule a call, same thing. For example, patients in Retina are on a treatment plan, the minimum days between their appointment tests is 28 days. Assort Health is able to look in athenahealth, identify when that patient's last appointment was, and ensure that when they reschedule that appointment, it doesn't fall below that 28 days. If a patient is canceling appointment, you'll cancel that appointment. At the end of the day, we get a report that shows us all the actions that it's taken. If there's a need for something to be corrected, then one of our supervisors can correct that.

**Client**

**Client**
Got it. We're trying to get a sense of the ROI on Assort Health. Now that you have Assort Health, how many people do you need in your call center?

**Expert**
Originally, I had thought that three people would be enough to manage our calls, but now that we realize we would need more than that, if not for Assort Health, I'd probably need five to six. With Assort Health, we're thinking that we actually can maintain three, maybe add one more, a fourth. Each call center employee of ours, if they're U.S.-based, costs us a minimum of $5,000 a month. Because the company is in California, we pay more than $20 an hour to start. If we hire someone, we outsource some of our call center employees to Columbia, South America and that costs us more than $2,000. Basically, there's two South Americans for one North American. I know that sounds bad.

With Assort Health, the deal we worked out is that it costs the equivalent of one North American employee per month and that same price will stay until we scale to 13,000 calls. Right now we're at 10,000 calls across the whole group call center. If Assort Health starts answering up to 13,000 calls, then we will renegotiate the contract to increase the fees. The way I see it is that for one Assort Health, it allows me to save at least $10,000 a month from having to hire at least two more staff members at a max.

**Client**
Got it. Effectively, Assort Health is saving you the cost. It's essentially doing the work of two North American call center representatives.

**Expert**
Pretty much, yes, or up to four South American call center employees. Normally, without Assort Health, I would look to probably scale the call center to five or six people. With Assort Health, I may just add one more person, may not have to, and I can keep it at three.

**Client**
Makes a lot of sense. In terms of just thinking about Assort Health going forward and the ROI, you mentioned that Assort Health can do scheduling for most things, but it can't do certain things, like scheduling an appointment without a referral. Is the plan to gradually expand Assort Health's use cases where it takes up more of the call center, or have you reached the maximum of what you're willing to outsource?

**Expert**
No, this is just the beginning. We felt we would be comfortable to having Assort Health start with this, perfect this, and then improve from there. What we're potentially looking at doing is tying in our new patient referrals so that Assort Health can also either pick up the call if the person presses one and it's a new patient referral, or potentially, I've talked to Assort Health about whether or not I think this would be a valuable thing for them to develop, is a full referral platform so that when as a practice, if we go out to referring office, we can tell them, "You have three methods. You can phone in, you can use this web form, or you can fax."

Basically, all of that information comes to the same CRM for referrals. Assort Health develops and we can track referrals that way. I think that would be a really value added benefit that could be attractive to a lot of different practices. If they're able to develop that, we'll launch that. We're also looking at another use case in the future. Right now we're looking to turn on their functionality of sending a text after the phone call to the patient to confirm whatever it is that they had done. In the future, we're looking at seeing, can we also just have Assort Health do our reminder calls instead of the tool that we currently use for that.

**Client**
Great. First, how much do you spend on Assort Health now? Let's say that Assort Health comes through with all these use cases. How much would you expect to spend or how much would you be willing to spend?

**Expert**
Right now Assort Health cost is more than $3,000 a month. For example, Phreesia which is our system that

---

we use for appointment reminders and some patient engagement, but mostly appointment reminders, costs us less than $2,500 a month. If I was going to build out Assort Health even more, I would say that I probably want to split the difference and say, "Okay, Assort Health, willing to pay an extra $1,000-$2,000 more a month if you can take over what Phreesia does.

The referral piece, I don't think should be too much of an additional burden. Overall spend, Phreesia already offers a web-based referral form. That's what we're currently using within that more than $2,500. That's why I'm saying that if Assort Health says, "Hey, for an additional $2,000, we can also do this and this," that would make a lot of sense to me. I'd say $1,000 a month that way too.

**Client**
Got it. You're saying $1,500 a month, is that just for reminder calls?

**Expert**
That would be for reminder calls, patient engagement.

**Client**
For the referral part, you said Phreesia does that for you now?

**Expert**
Phreesia does the web-based referrals and the reminders. They cost me more than $2,500 a month. If Assort Health is able to do all of that and says, "Hey, I can do all of this for $1,500, $2,000, $2,500," it would seem to make sense that way. You don't necessarily want to make a move from one platform to another for the same price unless that other platform has significant value-add.

At this point I don't think there would be a significant volume add, it would be more of a lateral move. If anything, I'd want to try to bundle it together and potentially pay less if I use Assort Health for both functions instead of having two different platforms and paying for two different services. With those two different services, right now I'm paying more than $7,500 a month because almost $5,000 for Assort Health, around $3,000 for Phreesia. If I can move it all over to Assort Health for even up to $7,000 or $7,500, that seemed like a reasonable deal to me.

**Client**
That makes sense. You said Phreesia does web-based reminders and referrals. If you got Assort Health, do you think Assort Health would be able to do those too or would Assort Health only be doing the phone-based referrals and reminders?

**Expert**
I think AI is capable of a lot of things. I would recommend to Assort Health that they build out a full platform because at this point, I don't think there's any medical practice that is just looking for appointment reminders because there's already services for that and whatnot. It's a waste of the power of AI. If Assort Health builds out a full referral-based system, I think that would be a better way to distinguish itself and provide valuable services to existing clients and new clients.

By full platform, I mean something that allows for referrals through web form, fax, and phone calls, and brings them all together in one dashboard that, for example, a referring office can look at to see if my patient's been scheduled and communicate with the office that they're sending that patient to. The patient in our office can use that dashboard to ensure that all the pieces we need for the successful new patient appointments are there and that we have some way of communicating back with the referring office in case something were to go awry.

**Client**
Helpful. In terms of your evaluation, you mentioned that Assort Health was the only voice health agent at that time that integrated with athenahealth, your EMR. Since then, have you evaluated any other competitive solutions or looked into any potential alternatives?

---

**Expert**
I looked at Parakeet, which also connects with athenahealth, and to me, I couldn't see something that would distinguish it enough where I would think that, "Oh, before launching Assort Health, let's do a deeper dive into Parakeet." Now if Assort Health, we have a three-month period that we're evaluating it. In those three months it's not able to hit the KPIs that we're looking at, then I wouldn't mind looking at other products, but so far, they seem to be doing a good job.

**Client**
Got it. If Parakeet doesn't do anything to distinguish it significantly from Assort Health, why Assort Health over Parakeet? Why not the other way around?

**Expert**
Assort Health was the first to market. They have deeper connections with athenahealth. What's really important is how well things connect with the systems we already use. If there's a tool out there that has more maturity in its connection with athenahealth, I would rather use that and trust the fact that more athenahealth users on it, they have more familiarity with it than somebody that might not as much. That would be one.

Two, it's that personal relationship too. Had the opportunity to develop a good relationship with Assort Health so far. Their customer service has been really good. The proof will be in the pudding once we're able to test them out for about three months and identify the certain measures that we have in place, which include reducing our missed calls.

We had more than 30% of our calls were missed calls. We wanted to see a significant reduction of that. We want to see a significant reduction of calls going to our front desk, which we've already seen. Having a high patient satisfaction score as well too. Patients will complain if a person answers a call and they'll also complain when AI answers the call. The goal is to get the complaints to AI be less than the complaints about people.

**Client**
Great. Can you walk us through the implementation process for Assort? It sounds like it took several months. What were the key roadblocks there?

**Expert**
Yes. Even though Assort Health works with a lot of orthopedic groups, we were the first retina group and there are some specific criteria for scheduling patients. Like I mentioned, the treatment plans and the spacing between days and things like that that Assort Health wasn't familiar with because you don't have that in orthopedics. Our training time or our time to build out Assort Health, it was equivalent to how long it would take us to train a new person anyways. We usually take about 90 days to train a new person to the extent that we feel they're fully competent in what they're supposed to be able to do.

With that being said, what we would do is we worked with their engineers, provided them all of our training material, all of our algorithms. They would program Assort Health and then we would test it out, see how it works, and then provide feedback for them to tweak it. That's what took that whole amount of time to get Assort Health primed for retina practices.

Now, other retina practices that come on board might have a much quicker onboarding because they can follow our templates. What we do is pretty similar in many ways to what a lot of other retina practices would need to do, especially when it comes time to treatment plans and spacing. Imagine for other retina practices will probably be a much quicker onboarding.

**Client**
Got it. Just specifically for the workflow aspect, I imagine that every clinic probably has a slightly different way that they do scheduling, slightly different flows. How much workflow is there in terms of setting up

---

Assort Health? How difficult would it be to switch from Assort Health to something like Parakeet in the future?

**Expert**
I think if Parakeet doesn't have any other retina practices, it would probably take them just as much time to adopt our workflows. If Parakeet is already working with other retina practices, it will probably be quicker because even though there are going to be some differences, overall, there's a lot of standardized ways to do it. For example, all retina practices, if they're doing treatment plans for patients, we're all using the same drugs and the same drugs all have the same 28-day requirement.

If you could program your AI to look at when the patient's last appointment was and ensure that their requested date is greater than that 28 days, then whether it's my practice or Person X's practice down the street, it's going to be the same thing. If they build it out once or if they build out, the AI being able to understand that, it should be applicable across the board.

I don't know how many other retina practices are currently using. I spoke at ASRS, which is our Association of Retina Surgeons, business of retina practice, on our use of AI in healthcare. This was just less than a month ago and at that time, it seemed that we were the only ones that have implemented in the retina space a voice AI agent. I don't know if there's other practices that just weren't there or didn't indicate that they're using voice AI and what type they're using.

Really, at the end of the day, we had to spend a lot of time because we were the first and there's very specific things involved in retina scheduling, but those specific things for retina scheduling are things that can be carried over to other retina practices. It may not translate to other specialty practices, but once either Assort Health or Parakeet or any of these other AI teams who work with one retina practice, I would assume that the build out of the AI voice agent tool for other retina practices would be a smaller time frame because they have the foundations covered.

**Client**
Super helpful. To read that back to you, as long as there's another company that has experience with retina care, their voice agent would pretty much likely be plug and play. The switching cost is pretty low at that point. It's not hard to do.

**Expert**
Yes. It probably won't take three months, it might take like a month and a half or something.

**Client**
Got it. I'm just curious what your NPS would be for your experience so far. If you had to rate Assort Health out of 10, what would you rate it?

**Expert**
Right now, I would give them like a nine. We're really happy with them. We're still in the beginning. They're responsive, their service is great. They're really understanding and patient with us because going through this process has also helped us identify weak spots in our original process that we just weren't aware of. This really helped us understand those better and address them. I'd recommend Assort Health to friends or family members. I would give it a nine.

**Client**
If Assort Health were to raise their prices by 50% on you, would you actively look elsewhere or would you maybe shrug it off and absorb them, given the ROI that the solution is providing you?

**Expert**
If they were to do it now, I probably wouldn't be too happy, but after a year, if they can truly demonstrate that my ROI existing compared to what it would have been if I didn't use them for, if there was a large enough gap to follow that increase, I think I would be okay with it. I'd have to look at it the same way that I

---

would look at, "Okay, how do I staff a call center properly? Am I paying my staff enough? Do I have enough members?" and things like that.

If I was to say, "Well, okay, based off of the volume, the success rate and all those other metrics, I wasn't able to hit it with this cost. In order to replicate that same success, it would probably cost me this much. If I use all humans, then a price increase of 50% could be justifiable." At the same time, I'd also want to see that, "Okay, what additional value am I going to be getting for that?" If there's to say that, "Okay, we'll include that appointment reminder and some other tools in that," then it seemed reasonable.

**Client**
Great. This was helpful. Thank you for your time. Enjoy the rest of your day.
