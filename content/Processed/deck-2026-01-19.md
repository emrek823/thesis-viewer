# Elera Health - Pre-Seed Pitch Deck 2026

## Overview
AI-enabled platform empowering outpatient providers to go independent.

## Problem
- **92M** people live in federally-designated primary care shortage areas (growing each year)
- **31 days** average wait to see an outpatient specialty provider
- **96%** of care is concentrated in clinic-based models, causing access barriers for millions
- Outpatient care can't be centralized: Primary and Specialty care are delivered in person and referrals are sourced locally
- Building a brand, operating a business, and delivering care at the same time is not sustainable for individual providers

## Why Now
- **27 states** now allow full practice authority for NPs without physician oversight (expanding to 34 this year)
- Most NPs cannot go independent due to complexity of branding, payer contracting, patient acquisition, and practice operations
- This **more than doubles** the outpatient independent market opportunity: from 500K addressable providers to north of 1M

## Solution
Elera turns licensed providers into in-network, hyper-local practices.

**Without Elera:**
- Only self-pay or confusing, long credentialing process
- Expensive marketing agencies or no brand at all
- Denials, long payment cycles, and complicated billing
- Spending hours scheduling and communicating
- Could take months to set up and start seeing patients

**With Elera:**
- Easy, fast credentialing with top national and local payers
- Professional website and online presence
- AI-powered RCM with guaranteed payments
- Admin tasks are automated in one comprehensive platform
- Providers start seeing patients within 3 weeks on average

## Platform Features
**The operating system for independent practices—powered by AI.**

1. **AI Scribe** - Documentation with note templates, recording
2. **AI Biller & Coder** - Suggested CPT/ICD-10 codes (97535 Self-Care/Home Management Training 95% confidence, F82 Specific Developmental Disorder of Motor Function 99% confidence)
3. **Schedule Management** - Weekly schedule with appointment types
4. **Referral Management** - Track pending, contacted, scheduled referrals
5. **AI Assistant** - Suggested actions, hours saved tracking (2.5 hours saved today with AI automation)
6. **Patient Portal ("Ellie")** - 24/7 care coordinator for patients between appointments

## Flywheel
Integrated primary and specialty care strengthens access, referrals, outcomes, and economics.

- **Care Network**: Integrated primary and specialty practices delivering coordinated care across settings
- **Demand**: Shared patient demand and referrals flowing across the network
- **Outcomes**: Improved outcomes driven by coordination, data, and continuity of care
- **Economics**: Lower acquisition costs and higher lifetime value from internal referrals and network scale

## TAM
**Massive clinician supply ready for an infrastructure layer.**

- **Today's TAM: $30B**
  - ~270K PTs, ~160K OTs, ~190K SLPs, and 460K+ NPs
- **Future TAM: $50B+**
  - Expanding to other outpatient specialty (chronic care, derm)
  - Provider supply growing at >10% CAGR
