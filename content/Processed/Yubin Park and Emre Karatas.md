### Falcon Platform Overview

- Three core products targeting different markets
	- ACO Builder: seasonal tool for ACO roster submission (completed sales cycle)
	- FWA engine: actively used by multiple ACOs, pilot with national payer
	- Sentinel: fully automated Medicare coverage determination system
- Sentinel capabilities:
	- Vectorized Medicare LCD articles for natural language search
	- Weekly claims ingestion via Medicare BCDA API
	- Automated claim analysis against Medicare guidelines
	- Provider risk scoring across multiple dimensions:
		- Address analysis (frequent moves, cross-state boundaries)
		- Billing pattern analysis (statistical anomalies)
		- LCD compliance (Medicare coverage policy adherence)
		- Peer comparison (regional specialty benchmarking)
	- Automated investigation letters for non-compliant providers

### Market Strategy & Positioning

- Healthcare fraud market highly fragmented
	- Payers use 10-15 different vendors for single claim processing
	- Excel-based workflows still dominant across major vendors
	- Senior decision makers cap at director level, limited career progression
- Current approach: serve as double-check tool for national payers
	- Not replacing existing vendors initially
	- Providing structured analysis for internal investigations
	- Lower-value sales but builds relationships for future expansion
- Target underserved segments first:
	- Medicare ACOs (ignored by high-cost fraud vendors)
	- Employer groups and risk-bearing organizations
	- Strategy: capture “cheap money” markets before competing for major payers

### Business Development & Partnerships

- National payer requesting more Medicare ACO data feeds
	- Same providers flagged across ACO and commercial claims
	- Faster identification than traditional watchlist processes
- Potential Scene partnership in discussion
- Introduction planned with Nikita (former Oscar claims rebuild specialist)
	- Complementary expertise: claims administration vs. FWA detection
	- Mutual learning opportunity on data bootstrapping and system integration

### Strategic Considerations & Next Steps

- Founders evaluating growth approach: organic scaling vs. fundraising
	- Current reliance on inbound leads and connections
	- Potential for 20 ACOs at $50K each = $1M revenue baseline
- Key hiring needs identified for employer market expansion
- Security concerns about AI-enabled healthcare fraud
	- DME/lab claims from non-existent entities using stolen Change Healthcare data
	- Anticipating “massive disaster” requiring enhanced detection capabilities
- Follow-up meetings:
	- Internal strategy discussion between Yubin and Neil
	- Introduction call with Nikita scheduled
	- Continued dialogue on funding/growth strategy
