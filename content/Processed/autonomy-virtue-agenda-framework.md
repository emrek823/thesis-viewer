Financial Snapshot
Current cash ($): $2.0mm
Monthly Burn ($; net/gross): $71k / $80k
Runway (# of months): ~26 months
L30D 
What Worked
PA Product: 
In implementation with practice #2 and continue to build backlog
Bringing on a dev shop recommended to us to supplement contract engineers and increase development velocity
MSO: 
Deepening relationship with the NC practice, which may become the first full MSO migration to Athena
Set up a demo with physicians on Wednesday; leadership on Thursday
Trading redlines on contract with Athena
Other: 
Seeing increased inbound interest from practices through word of mouth
Signed a recruiting contingency agreement with SingleSprout; early candidates appear strong
What Didn’t Work
Tx practice has gone quiet in the middle of trading redlines; working to re-engage
Lost another quality engineering candidate who ultimately wants to be founder vs. founding eng

N30D Objectives
Close one practice for full MSO before year-end
Sign athena contract
Finish branding refresh and prep for Q1 conferences

Asks for Virtue
None this week (thank you for SingleSprout & Alloy intros!)

Financial Snapshot
Current cash ($): $2.1mm
Monthly Burn ($; net/gross): $90k / $100k
Runway (# of months): ~27 months
L30D 
What Worked
PA Product: 
Initial stages of onboarding second practice for prior authorization automation
MSO: 
Trading redlines with a new Tx clinic to be the first athenahealth migration; targeting December 1st to start
Finalized athenahealth pricing and moving to contracting
Other: 
Hopeful that we are close on hiring our first few engineers — sent out two offers this week and have a few other folks in medium / late stages
What Didn’t Work
We have been trying to onboard additional contract engineers but dev shops have been unreliable (talent quality is mixed, had 2 lined up and both fell through)
=Product development takes longer than expected (lots of testing/debugging that needs to happen) — underestimated time to market

N30D Objectives
Sign contract for first MSO migration
Sign athenahealth contract
Bring on minimum of 1 full-time engineer hire

Asks for Virtue
None this week

Financial Snapshot
Current cash ($): $2.1mm
Monthly Burn ($; net/gross): $80k / $94k
Runway (# of months): ~28 months
L30D 
What Worked
PA Product: 
Successful demo to NPC practices → moving to contracting for PA product with 2 new practices and 2-3 others close behind them
This will be an opportunity to test whether PA can be the wedge into a broader MSO partnership
MSO: 
Have 2 practices in late stage pipeline for full MSO services on athena
Working towards finalizing athenahealth agreement & pricing
Other: 
Launched referral workflow with Texas Neuro, finalizing reporting work, and continue to execute on billing
What Didn’t Work
Last month we were concerned with pace of BD but that is no longer the issue
Sales is now well ahead of product 
Engineering hours is now the biggest roadblock
We need to be able to meet the demand but are understaffed
Hiring engineers remains the #1 priority but it’s also the most challenging as we all know
We are trying to de-risk as much as we can by outsourcing parts of the workflow and relying on dev shops

N30D Objectives
Sign contracts for PA product with 2 additional practices
Sign contract for full MSO with 1+ practice 
Solidify athenahealth pricing & sign contract
Bring on 1-2 contract engineers 

Asks for Virtue
Chat through Eng being a blocker and creative ways to unstick this

Other
Officially closed out the raise ($2.5mm) - brought on two new angels (Sharvil Patel, co-founder Nimbus Health) and Dylann Sands (GP @ Animal Capital)





Financial Snapshot
Current cash ($): $2.2mm
Monthly Burn ($; net/gross): $30k / $42k
Runway (# of months): ~30 months
L30D 
What Worked
Continue to get opportunities to build relationships with / pitch to largest neuro practices → believe we are the only vendor invited to the National Practice Consortium (NPC) conference next week (20+ of the largest practices)
Launched PA and successfully running most frequent payor/drug combination end-to-end; we did a demo at the Texas Neuro board meeting with their physicians and it went very well → they are excited about us
Becoming more ingrained generally with the practice and doing billing, referral, and reporting work
What Didn’t Work
Recruiting: Challenging hiring market for A+ talent and generally folks are indexing for slightly more stability (i.e. we’re too early for them)
Have increased interviewing volume, but not a ton of breakout candidates
Product: launched PA agent but development is moving too slowly and we need to prioritize speed. As a result, we’re exploring subcontracting with another PA vendor to manage some of the more ‘technically complex’ parts of actually preparing/submitting the auths so that we can onboard folks sooner (while simultaneously building out our capabilities)
BD: Need to nail the ‘MSO’ pitch and who we are / what we do in a digestible way because last two pitches ended with practices thinking ‘they could do it for cheaper in-house’ even though we know they can’t

N30D Objectives
Nail pitch with NPC practices and sign 2 more groups to the PA product
Solidify negotiations with athenahealth and sign our first practice to transition EMRs

Asks for Virtue
Discuss status of highest quality candidates & proposed next steps
Any portfolio companies with elite/differentiated new employee onboardings




Financial Snapshot
Current cash ($): $2.2mm
Monthly Burn ($; net/gross): $30k / $42k
Runway (# of months): ~30 months
L30D 
What Worked
Being onsite has helped us identify/begin work on additional workflows and practice CEO recently helped us unlock a “stuck” BD deal
Brought on another contract engineer (deeper infra experience) and a technical advisor (ex-Epic), both have already delivered ROI in a short timeframe
Launched Circle community for independent neurology administrators in partnership with NeuroNet and onboarding groups in batches
What Didn’t Work
Hiring needs to move faster but we’re seeing slower than expected initial response rates to outreach; brought on a part time technical recruiter (old Redesign colleague) for additional sourcing support
2 candidates doing final technical round (coding assessment) this week
2-4 candidates expected to move into technical round this/next week
Ideally want another 10-20 strong profiles in next 10-15 days

N30D Objectives
Ramp auth product by expanding into more payors followed by 1-2 additional drugs
Begin work on referral automation workflow
Mapping out product roadmap across four functional areas: EMR, PM, Data and Clinical
Sign at least 1 engineering candidate by end of September to start late Sept/early Oct

Asks for Virtue
Intros to any folks who have thought through EMR strategy or have spent significant time with athenahealth 
Engineers!!
Introductions to anyone at The Villages (Florida) – potential site of care optimization on infusions opp

Financial Snapshot
Current cash ($): $2.2mm
We are still expecting $75k in additional proceeds from the seed round
Monthly Burn ($; net/gross): $90k / $108k
Runway (# of months): ~30 months

L30D 
What Worked
Early validation from MCHN practice supports our thesis that we can drive stronger RCM outcomes by taking ownership of front/back office and having better visibility into full process
No longer focusing on building an EMR will allow us to build a faster back-end and get more PM functionality out sooner
What Didn’t Work
Eng continues to be a blocker to speed (so we’re prioritizing hiring/recruiting)
Need to find a better balance between more BD and focusing on existing ops/product development (we are more weighted to latter)
Hypothesis is that a successful launch with Texas Neuro will allow us to sell into more folks through case study/testimonial but we need to do some more work on pipeline development independently

N30D Objectives
Launch v1 of auth product with Texas Neurology
Launch is delayed as we swapped out the backend given we’re no longer building the EMR
Pushes things back by 2-3 weeks but result will be a far more scalable product 
Mapping out product roadmap across four functional areas: EMR, PM, Data and Clinical
Build strong top of funnel for engineering talent

Asks for Virtue
Brainstorm BD strategy – close deals and build density but give up margin to do so vs defend margins and potentially lose out on some deals
Intros to any folks who have thought through EMR strategy or have spent significant time with athenahealth 
Continued ask for leads on great engineers

Financial Snapshot
Current cash ($): $2.2mm
We are still expecting $75k in additional proceeds from the seed round
Monthly Burn ($; net/gross): $96k / $104k
Runway (# of months): ~30 months

L30D 
What Worked
On auth product, good progress setting up the right data pipelines we need; timeline is to launch v1 by end of July / early August
Early signals that we're driving value on RCM with the Manhattan practice 
Making inroads with reporting product for eCW users
What Didn’t Work
Engineer work has been strong but could have gone faster with full-time FTE
BD has taken a back-seat to day-to-day operations with Manhattan practice and product build; need to find more balance 

N30D Objectives
Bring on full-time engineer (Maxine or otherwise); eng has the potential to be a blocker if we don't solve it in the next 60 days

Asks for Virtue
Main ask is thinking through a proposal for Maxine (compensation, structure, positioning) and help selling & closing her
Intros to strong engineering talent
Intros to folks who have negotiated commercial contracts with pharma for drug purchasing

Financial Snapshot
Current cash ($): $2.3mm
We are still expecting $75k in additional proceeds from the seed round
Monthly Burn ($; net/gross): $88k / $91k
Runway (# of months): ~30 months

L30D 
What Worked
Strong/positive feedback from initial demo of the auth product with neurology practice leaders
Contract engineer (Maxine) has been an unlock in terms of product development
Took over billing for Manhattan practice + beginning to prep for buy and bill
What Didn’t Work
Not having Maxine full time has slowed down product development by 1-2 weeks
BD has been moving slower than we’d like (largely practice driven and we need to straddle fine line between moving process along and annoying the providers)

N30D Objectives
Launch v1 of the prior auth product
Begin to map out product roadmap for 2H'25
Launch search for founding engineer (if Maxine does not work out)
Beginning outreach to TX based neurology groups

Asks for Virtue
Introductions to engineering talent (senior full stack engineers) - we want them before Solstice and ANNA :)
Brainstorm ideas for practice working capital facility (we have some but want to cover all possible bases)
Understand what you’re seeing in Series A market + what do these investors value (traction, margins, etc)
