### Business Pivot & Current Model

- Pivoted from Pi Health (enrollment challenges with payers) to Understood Care (Medicare advocacy)
- Separated from co-founder David due to execution speed misalignment, partnered with Kevin (Uber engineer, 2 previous startups)
- Launched March 2024 with first patient late March, Medicare payment received quickly
- Leveraging new QI/PIN codes for Medicare-covered advocacy (released early 2024)
- Process flow:
	- Online signup or phone intake (insurance eligibility check)
	- 20-minute MD appointment to qualify for reimbursable advocacy
	- One-on-one advocate matching (2-3 days total)
	- Ongoing advocacy work (DME, appointments, insurance navigation)

### Operations & Unit Economics

- Patient acquisition: Facebook/Instagram ads targeting chronic condition pain points, cost per lead optimized
- SEO strategy in development (articles ranking for patient search terms)
- Reimbursement: $80/hour time-based codes (talk time, charting, research, provider calls)
	- First hour + 30-minute increments, no billing cap
	- 3-5+ units trigger medical records request (full reimbursement after documentation)
- Advocate supply: 5,500 applications in Greenhouse queue, zero supply constraints
	- Requirements: RN, CMA, or licensed professional (company standard, not Medicare requirement)
	- Compensation: $25/hour with 70% patient-facing time productivity target
	- Current team: 5 full-time, 10 part-time advocates
- Target market: 68 million Medicare patients, 90% have chronic conditions qualifying for codes

### Financing & Next Steps

- Same entity as Pi Health, rolled over existing financing with full investor support
- Historical cap table:
	- Pre-seed: YC standard deal
	- Seed: $3M raised at $22.5M and $30M caps
	- Co-founder departure handled cleanly (2.75% equity), new co-founder Kevin has 30%
- Fundraising: Planning $5M seed round conversations in coming weeks
- Market expansion: California and Washington Medicaid already adopting G codes
- Estimated LTV: ~$2K per patient, $100B+ total addressable market for advocacy codes alone

### Next Steps

- Second call scheduled to cover:
	- Technology implementation details
	- Revenue metrics and year-end projections
	- Detailed growth planning
- Potential in-person meeting during Sam’s SF visit or Emre’s NYC office visits
