### Falcon Health Platform Evolution & Growth

- Serving 1.5M Medicare lives across all clients with full claims data flowing through system
- Platform learning accelerated by customer diversity and regional insights
	- Florida vs California require different approaches - building more localized solutions
	- Customers using platform beyond FWA: public health analysis, contracting analysis
- Added ChatGPT-style interface driving unexpected use cases
	- Self-serving analytics platform saving customer time vs bugging analytics teams
	- Clear ROI once customers start using - can run complex logic on demand
- Strong product-market fit in ACO space ($50-100K ACVs)
	- Can likely scale this business independently without funding
	- Geographic expansion opportunities but limited to “nice business” not billion-dollar potential
- Early but promising progress on payer side
	- Large Blues plan contract expected to close within 30 days
	- Already using platform and finding value, contract signature pending

### Market Positioning & Platform Strategy

- Clear opportunity to become comprehensive solution vs point solutions
	- Large customers want single vendor for payment integrity vs 5-6 different vendors
	- Domain expertise in claims/clinical data workflows core differentiator
- Key challenge: Extracting audit domain knowledge faster to expand across markets
	- Need to integrate expertise into platform as scope expands
	- Similar to Dart Health’s 3-month to 3-week integration improvement
- Competitive advantages in AI landscape
	- Foundation model providers lack claims editing/payer domain knowledge
	- Data access and domain expertise create defensible moat
	- “App layer commoditization” narrative doesn’t apply to specialized domains

### Capital Strategy & Next Steps

- Currently cash flow positive, no desperation for capital
- Selective approach to fundraising - want right partner beyond just capital
	- Interest from strategic customers (existing clients) for equity alignment
	- Skeptical of financial investors without industry expertise
- Two potential paths discussed:
- Need high-quality talent additions - “can’t add mediocre” people
- Virtue positioned as first call when fundraising decision made
- Purple Labs intro offered for potential data partnership/integration opportunities
