LONG BEACH, CA, UNITED STATES, May 13, 2025 /[EINPresswire.com](https://www.einpresswire.com/)/ -- [SCAN Group](http://www.thescangroup.org) (SCAN), a diversified not-for-profit healthcare company that operates [SCAN Health Plan](http://www.scanhealthplan.com), one of the nation's largest and fastest growing not-for-profit Medicare Advantage health plans, today announced that [myPlace Health](http://www.myplacehealth.com/) (myPlace), an integrated care delivery organization specializing in serving vulnerable older adults who wish to live in their homes and communities for as long as safely possible through the PACE (Program for All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly) model, is now wholly owned by SCAN and part of its family of companies.  
  
“By fully bringing myPlace Health into SCAN’s family of companies, we’re asserting our belief that PACE is one of the most effective models for delivering holistic, comprehensive care to older adults with the most complex healthcare needs,” said Dr. Sachin H. Jain, CEO of SCAN Group and SCAN Health Plan. “This acquisition allows us to expand our impact and continue delivering on our mission to keep seniors healthy and independent.”   
  
myPlace launched in 2021 in collaboration with SCAN Group and Commonwealth Care Alliance (CCA) to bring the PACE to underserved adults in Los Angeles. Earlier this spring, SCAN acquired CCA’s equity interest in myPlace thereby assuming full operational and strategic leadership of myPlace Health and underscoring SCAN's commitment to the PACE model and expanding innovative care for the most vulnerable older adults.  
  
myPlace provides comprehensive, coordinated care to older adults who are eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid, or only Medicaid. Its first brick-and-mortar PACE center opened in Downtown Los Angeles in early 2024 and a second location is scheduled to open this summer in South Los Angeles.  
  
“myPlace was founded to address a critical gap in care for dually eligible seniors, and SCAN’s full acquisition represents the next chapter in that mission,” said Rona Li, SCAN Group’s Chief Development Officer. “We are proud to strengthen our investment in PACE as part of our broader strategy to create a dignified healthcare experience for seniors and their families in the communities we serve.”  
  
“Joining SCAN Group fully aligns with our vision to provide compassionate, coordinated care that helps older adults live well and independently,” said Robbie Pottharst, CEO of myPlace Health. “We are excited to build on our foundation and continue growing our impact with SCAN Group and other mission-aligned sponsors.”
