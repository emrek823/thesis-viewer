## Client-Expert Dialogue

**Client**
Hi. Thanks for taking the time to talk with me. I am interested in learning more about applications of AI both in healthcare and in other industries. I'll be excited to learn from you how you're using tools like Abridge and voize and some of these new tools that are coming out. Sounds like you're a good person to talk to about that.

**Expert**
All these AI nursing initiatives and AI vendors know the space super well for better or worse. I'm at a very complex IDN, so I am always being entertained by the latest and greatest of offerings. I can speak to you at a high level and as deep as we need to go from what is it really looking like at a healthcare system level when all these vendors say it can solve the world. Would love to tell you what the real answers are as we know them.

**Client**
As a starting point, why don't you just give me a bit about your background and then tell me about Lifepoint Health?

**Expert**
I come at this as a physician myself, have been for 16 years. At my core, I understand what we're really trying to solve as not only a clinician, but an end user of our products. For the past eight and a half years, take that foundation, oversee clinical AI, all clinical IT for a large for-profit healthcare system. Do business in 35 out of 50 states, 62 acute care hospitals, hundreds of medical office buildings that surround our acute hospitals with all specialties. We also about 105 post-acute facilities.

Think rehab, long-term care, and behavioral health plus psychiatric hospitals. My role is overseeing all the technology across all of our care settings. We support over 12 different EHRs across each of those care settings that I mentioned, and yet really try to move with AI innovation as much as we can within, no one vendor can help all of our different care settings on our EHRs.

I'm always looking in the market space of, what can this vendor do, how can this vendor help me, and who's got the best features for the best price, which is the challenge of a lot of these vendors today as they're starting to scale into nursing AI, which we all can admit is immensely valuable. How do we prove that value, and how do we get an ROI? That is the big question mark that's not going away for these tools anytime soon.

**Client**
I'm hoping you have the answer to that question mark for me today. I'm just kidding.

**Expert**
I'm going to try.

## Client
I'm kidding. It sounds like you have close to a couple hundred hospital facilities. Again, as someone who's doing work across spaces and medical discipline, give me a sense for how big that is as a business? Is it a publicly owned company?

## Expert
Private equity-backed. We have 10,000 inpatient beds.

## Client
Got it. Is there anything else you think I need to know as background on the business that would be helpful?

## Expert
I would just say we use a multitude of AI scribe vendors today. Upwards of four to five active vendors today, whereas to date, we have really been heavily, heavily skewed just to the provider side of where AI is going. I think that, to me, is where we are with this maturation. We're starting to hear more about AI nursing. It is really just scratching the surface of how it's going or where it's going to go over the next couple of years. It's very, very early.

## Client
Got it. On the provider side, it's farther along?

## Expert
Significant. We've got pretty heavy saturation in the outpatient ambulatory clinics. You are starting to see a little bit more encroachment into the emergency rooms. The next frontier is going to be the acute/inpatient side of the house. We're not really there yet.

## Client                                           Sean Doolan
Which systems would those be? The same systems or different?
DO NOT COPY
sd@virtuevc.com

## Expert
Abridge is one. Nabla is one. Ambience is one. Commure is another. These are players that will play across care settings. Now, there are many other vendors who are landlocked in outpatient, and that's their model. They're going to do outpatient, God love them, but they're always going to be looked at differently than the bigger players, that I can have one vendor help me across multiple care settings, which is the ideal, though it's next to impossible to realize because of the tech complexities.

## Client
Got it. If I repeat that back to you, your purview is acute care and post-acute. You know that these solutions are being used across other disciplines and there's value.

## Expert
Just to clarify, I use them. I oversee our EDs and our outpatient as well.

## Client
You're using that as well

## Expert
100%. I wouldn't happen if I didn't start it in those places and try to get it to evolve beyond doses is my mission statement at a corporate level. We've got to move these further along to start to show a real ROI.

## Client
Got it. I don't want to lead you too much, so I think maybe how it's going and what that ROI looks like is a

## Expert Insights on AI in Healthcare

A year ago this time, if you tracked all these vendors' mission statements, it was "Let's bring joy back to providers. Let's get them home before 5:00 P.M. Let's potentially improve their quality of life and maybe keep these providers within your organization, so they'll get burnt out." Flash forward a year now and the message is completely different. Why? The market is saturated with AI vendors.

Now, you're saying, "Great. I'm glad you helped me keep that provider, but I need a lot more from you. I need additional features. It's no longer just capturing visits, and therefore, documentation output. It needs to be more. Can you give me a cliff note version of that patient's care for the past year before I go in and see them? Can you help me with coding on top of the diagnosis that you're outputting because the provider said they're a diabetic? Can you help me with potential procedural codes that could replace something else within the RCM life cycle that I could potentially show a value for these tools and take something off the list?"

Now, you're challenging these vendors to say, "I need more. I don't just need documentation. I need all these additional features. I need you to be valuable for me in the emergency room for encounters there. Can you help me with inpatient workflows?" Here's the other thing, "Can you help me with specialty workflows?" A lot of these tools started with primary care. Love primary care, think the world of it.

That same doc in general surgery, that doctor in orthopedics who despise anything in the EHR, their time is incredibly valuable. I need specific workflows that are going to help them potentially see more patients. You're always challenging, what do the specialty workflows look like as well from these vendors?

That's the most important piece of "I need these tools that give me less EHR feel and more on specialty provider-specific workflows that builds the value for them." On top of it, "Give me the best price you got and give me the most integration into EHRs that you have." Those two questions right there are what separate this field wildly in the end, is pricing and integration. Lastly, care setting use.

### Client Interaction

**Client:** Sean Doolan
That makes a ton of sense. If I, again, try to repeat this back to you to check my understanding. A year ago, it was just like the AI scribe is revolutionary functionality that is really helping people save time where you don't have to go home and write notes for three hours kind of thing and bringing joy. Everyone knew how valuable that was, and that's why we've seen 30 different people doing this pretty well.

Now, the way to, one, for the platforms to expand, but also what you're demanding as the customer is, can you help automate everything else other than just taking notes and making that piece better? Can you improve all of our workflows to make people even more, even happier and even more efficient? Is that a fair summary?

**Expert:**
Yeah, because as much as these are clinician-friendly tools, the financial people who understand, "Hey, I got to get money out of these types of things and if I'm going to pay for this, I need to see something." Just bringing "joy back" is not enough to move the needle on these. It becomes a niche, and then a niche doesn't move the needle.

**Client:**
Got it. I know price integrations but help me think about how you think about the ROI from these tools.

**Expert:**
To me, you can't really lead a provider to say, "Hey, see more patients with this." You hope organically because this takes a lot off their plate. It really works out where you have better patient care and engagement with a patient, which means a lot to keep that patient wanting to come back. You've got better documentation, and therefore, in theory, you can bill and code better because the documentation's improved. These are clear ROI triggers.

These tools can now give me specific diagnoses that it's linked to the ICD-10, which is the diagnostic map, for me to be more precise with my coding. If I have any type of value-based care initiatives that I have to lean into, it may be certain types of decision support or this plan needs a smoking cessation that I need to remind the provider to do. These tools can all help log a lot of that information for a provider to be much smoother with this and keep the provider from the EHR.

I can use it on my phone. It's very mobile friendly, and I don't have to touch the EHR. Yet all I got to do is go into the EHR, click sign, and my notes are done. Those have been the ROI, thus far, to varying extent. Most of these tools today are proposing codes. They have replaced your current coding vendors or however you do coding today.

They haven't removed anybody yet, but they're building the campaign to say, "Trust our coding. Over the next couple of months, you'll see that our coding is probably more sophisticated than how you manually code it or lean into another third-party to code on top of documentation." That is the next phase of where the ROI is going to really start to prove itself, if it's possible.

## Client
I want to make this tangible for me for a couple of the ones that we've seen. Again, I'm probably most familiar with Abridge and then voize as a younger up and coming competitor. Walk me through Abridge. When you first decided to partner with them, what the use case was, how you use it today, how it's going. Let's do the journey there.

## Expert
Started August of 2023. Built up the opportunity of "Hey, this could be a vendor that helps only in our Epic markets." We only have four Epic markets, so I couldn't look at this vendor across my healthcare system. They just don't offer that as a feature. It's an Epic-only vendor. To me, that's the biggest problem. The biggest headwind that they have over the past two weeks and yesterday is, they're only integrated with one player and that player created their own AI and will be.

Long story to get back to, in January of 2024, went to the market, did a "Hey, we've got a solution for all willing outpatient providers who would be interested in being an early adopter for AI in the market." There wasn't any scrutiny of who was a good candidate? Interest was what we were really looking at. Eighteen months later, in a market that has 230 doctors, we've got 60 providers using the tool today. We didn't force anybody.

We just said, "Hey, if you'd like to, here's an opportunity to use this tool." It is well-received, but it has really just grown incrementally by word of mouth or if a new provider hears that their colleague uses it. They're interested. We haven't pushed big campaigns, but I think because we haven't had great ROI. We haven't seen making such a big difference. It's a nice-to-have feature for our providers, but it hasn't automatically gone "My gosh, I couldn't do without this." We are now starting to move into "Could we start to push this into our emergency room providers?"

That is that second wave of where we're trending, with the hope maybe in the next, let's say six to eight months as Abridge gets better with their acute use cases, they're starting some of those alpha beta tests. With some bigger users, we could potentially start to see value in the inpatient side. Right now, we're just scoping how it could work in the ED after we get through the ambulatory, which ambulatory feels like it's static in nature today.

## Client
Got it. On the acute side, is that more Epic? I'm trying to understand the Epic dependency here because it sounds like you didn't roll out. Also, what percentage of your total doctor population? I know you said 10,000 beds, but 230 doctors have access to Abridge. Not that they use it, but have access. What is that overall population of doctors?

## Expert
10% of our doctors. It's only 10%.

## Conversation Transcript

### Client
10%.%. That's because 10% of those facilities use Epic, of the total facilities.

### Expert
Correct. Besides Epic, we are a lot of everything else. We're not the best customer for Abridge because we don't have a lot of Epic. You have to have everything Epic for you to be a good customer of Abridge.

### Client
That makes sense. I'm curious why you still chose Abridge there rather than trying to have something else that integrates with Epic and also a bunch of other things.

### Expert
That's a perfectly fair question. At the time, there was some innovation, really early stage, there was some seeding that went in to potentially support Abridge as they were scaling the market that it's in is right around the corner from the base when they started. It was a little bit of a corporate kind of, "Hey, this could be a good endeavor. Let's put a little bit of seed behind it and see what potentially was available." That pushed it a little bit further. There's always been talk of us being able to maybe potentially add more Epic sites. There's a mission underway for that. It worked with that. To me, that's been it.

### Client
That's really helpful. Where we are today, obviously, what are people, 60 out of 230, what are they using Abridge for?

### Expert
Patient documentation.

### Client
Really just the scribe and documentation.

### Expert
That's really all they can do. You've seen some things last week that talked about prior auths. You've seen some other things. It's all conjecture. It's all PR. As an end user, are they seeing any impact to that? No, none.

### Client
I think I have a lot of questions about Abridge, but if Epic comes out with their own thing, do you think that you turn off Abridge and just use Epic's thing at these Epic sites?

### Expert
If that can land as much as they are bullish on it. We used to be customers of Nuance DAX Copilot, so I know the product super well. If they can come with a more integrated product that's embedded within our Epic, 100%, you're going to see a lot of customers go the Epic route, because it's going to be almost free and you're not going to need to deal with a third-party application on top of it, which to me makes it a smoother process by default.

I think it's ominous that Epic chose Microsoft and all the reasons why because they're never going to be competition to Epic and yet Microsoft can give it away and yet get all their other features through Azure. I think it's a business strategy. I think it feels like it leaves Abridge in a spot of what to do next, because all those customers that are Epic today, that most of them are academics or not for profit, maybe they like the customization of Abridge.

If you really look at it, it's not that customized. It's a nice feature, but there are way better vendors that exist today that have better features than Abridge. They just didn't have the lineage of being linked to Epic like.

## Conversation Transcript

**Client:**
That's where I was going to go next. Is it more of a product quality with the scribe and documentation, or is it that they, to your earlier point, others are building a more complete set of AI features including the revenue cycle management and coding and they do it all together, where it would be hard for Epic or any other EHR to actually build all of that as quickly as one of these vendors?

**Expert:**
You would think that these vendors are much more nimble, of course. When you start dealing with RCM and prior auth, I'm going to tell you, no healthcare system is reliant on your EHR for it. You're looking at your Ensembles and your R1s to do your RCM. Prior auth, to me, the news of why they started doing prior auth, they made it a clinical reason.

Prior auths do not happen by your clinicians. They don't want to deal with prior auth. They want an administrator to maybe use the AI to create prior auths based upon a diagnosis and a procedure. You keep the provider out of that. Right now, the prior auth announcement keeps the provider firmly engaged in that process. It's a disconnect there, in my opinion.

**Client:**
Prior auth is actually, in your opinion, a totally separate problem that doesn't build.

**Expert:**
It's not a provider problem. You're dealing with your payer problems. It's your admin staff. It's your RCM specialist within a clinic that has to deal with the engagement of your payers. If you look at that announcement with Allegheny and Highmark, these are two payers that are playing along with this initiative.

Because they're in the backyard of Sean Doolan where Abridge is, it's not necessarily a tool. You're going to have to bring your RCM team, who primarily do all of your prior auths for you or on your behalf. They're the ones who are going to need to be impacted by this, which right now, the tool is mostly provider-driven, not RCM specialist-driven.

**Client:**
Are there other things that other provider-facing functionalities that they could go into or not really? What would that be?

**Expert:**
I think you've got to really dig deeper into your specialty workflows. I'm just going to give you an example. Your ophthalmologist, your hardest to reach specialists are the ones that probably are continuing to build out your specialty workflows, continuing to add in more specificity around diagnostics that continue to get better. Building out referral management is another big deal about connecting a patient to a fellow provider, building out that model of ease of documentation transfer, and crossing into other care settings.

I know we've heard a bit about what they do with Emory and certain hospitals where they moved into some of the ED models. I would tell you I've had other products for a year now working in EDs. They're getting into other marketplaces, which is good. Other care settings. It just feels like it's going at this very deliberate pace, whereas the PR is pushing it like it's moving mountains.

These things are already happening out there. It makes it seem like I don't like it, but it is not that. I just think there are better, more complete vendors that are really solving the end user and market problems today than the Abridge interpretation of those problems. That, to me, is where I feel like there's the disconnect. Not that it's not a good product.

I think that's my intuition as well, without knowing a ton. Walk me through what some of those other products are that you see as doing a better job of more directly solving the customer pain point.

**Expert**
I'll take Ambience as an example. Not a customer, but know them incredibly well for various reasons. They've got a very robust tool that crosses multiple EHRs. They've got specialty workflows across a wide spectrum of specialties. They have tools that have strong coding which is happening with really specificity in mind. They've got tools to help you predict your E&#x26;M, which is your visit codes.

That gives you a pathway to think through, "Hey, if this is as reliable as they are showing" and you can run a shadow campaign of proving it, you could replace your 3M, Solventum or your Nym or your Fathom that do your coding today because these tools could come with it baked into the offering that they have. They also do referral management.

They connect the dots with AI agents to support referral management, which is this abyss of we put an order in, but I don't know if they're going to go see that specialist. They help facilitate connecting those dots, which is a big value driver for a healthcare system. They're moving forward into additional care settings like inpatient, like post-acute, like the ED. They're just a little bit more aggressive with some of that. Their AI coming from OpenAI is really solid and accurate.

**Client**
It sounds like they're attacking a similar problem as Abridge. It sounds like, like you were saying earlier, they've started from more of a holistic product standpoint. You just think that it's not that they're necessarily thinking about the strategy here differently, it's just that the product is just more customer-friendly. You wouldn't say that it's really a difference in true strategy other than execution. Is that fair?

**Expert**
They just have a better UI/UX experience for end users. They have more integration into other EHRs that Abridge doesn't have. Therefore, they've worked on a lot of the experience across Oracle Cerner, across athena, across other EHRs that make it more robust, "Hey, I can use this product." They've been taking some of the Epic business from Abridge. Cleveland Clinic would be a perfect example.

They did a year bake off and compared five top vendors and Ambience was head and shoulders number one. Incidentally enough, number two was Nabla, number three was Abridge. Again, they've done things with a lot of clinician in mind, and they've really heard their customers really well. I think that's to their credit. They've got a team that has a lot of clinician understanding, provider type by provider type and have taken a lot of that information and built based on that feedback, which I think is valuable. They've just done a little bit more on the ground than you've seen from Abridge.

**Client**
Where would you put Nabla in that conversation?

**Expert**
Nabla's in my top four. I'd also put Commure in my top four. Suki could be a top five. Suki be number five. I put Commure and Nabla, right there neck and neck for very different reasons. Nabla to me comes at this with great integration across some of those very difficult EHRs. When I'm saying Allscripts, when I say Oracle Cerner, they've done a lot of good work to integrate with some of the harder to reach EHRs, which are very attractive to me because not many vendors have. They're the best price in this market space, bar none, which price helps me tell the ROI story.

Their AI is really strong, and they've helped me. I've used them for a year now in the ED. Earlier this summer, I launched in our post-acute markets, where I have Oracle Cerner with them. They're right there. Commure, Augmedix to me, they've got some of the most complicated healthcare systems out there. They are HCA vendor. They've got all 184 EDs that HCA has using their tool within the ED setting.

I'm working with them right now to help me with, and here's a unique scenario that you have to think about.

**Expert Discussion on EHR Integration and Market Players**

----

**Client**
If we then go, help me understand where we've heard about voize as an up-and-coming player. Tell me how they fit in here.

**Expert**
Very little mention because they're coming from Europe. There has been very little market noise, especially around voize. Same thing around Heidi. Heidi's U.K.-based. These are products that do a lot when it comes to potential utilization. They don't have little to no integration into your top of mind EHRs, which to me is the ultimate limiting step.

You can say you can charge $79 or $99 a month for a non-integrated tool. You're never going to get widespread adoption, nor are you going to get enterprise agreements because that is not a model that we want this type of patient information residing on a tool that doesn't automatically flow this into an EHR. It's just a risk. They're in Maine, and I could list to you others. There's just not any market penetration at a high scale. Freed is another one that's out there. Nice vendor. Know them super well and know somebody very well.

It's just they're leaning into independent practitioners. "Okay. Great, hit that market, but it feels very isolated." To me, I think I feel like voize and Heidi. Sully.ai is another one, they just feel a little bit isolated of how they're going to lean into large healthcare systems and make an impact. They're mostly outpatient tools or home health tools or specialty tools. There's a niche, but it's a narrow field.

----

**Client**
It's way more narrow than going after the big whale, which is like all of the primary. It's everything you said that's connected with primary care broadly.

----

**Expert**
I tried it. I've tried non-integrated solutions. I get about three out of 10 providers who want to play along, but I'm never going to get those seven out of 10, because part of what the problem here is the technology, the AI is a little bit fascinating, but if I give them dictation through like a Nuance or M*Modal that does what these tools do. Even if the AI compiles a note in a little cleaner fashion. I still got to cut and paste. That is a major rate limiting step. Unfortunately, even if we're calling it AI.

One other piece, and I don't mean to sound like a run on, but as you've seen these big EHR vendors. Epic's the latest. Oracle Cerner is doing their own thing now too. They've walled off a lot of integration, where they've made it very, very difficult. That low, low price is a myth. If you're going to try to have integration into any of these EHRs. Same thing with athena. Athena is creating their own now too, and they want to charge somewhere around $200 or more a month. It really distorts these tools who don't have integration and try to say, "We'll come out at $100 a month." It's hard. Really hard.

----

**Client**
I want you to paint me a picture, but I'll give you an example. I want to get your take on what the vision of the future looks like. I think there's a world where Abridge, most recently valued, that was like a $5 billion company.

### Conversation Transcript

**Expert:**
A myth, man. It's a total myth. I'm sorry.

**Client:**
It sounds like if I were to paint the picture of why that's the case, people are like, they can go and capture everything and eventually just build an AI native EHR. Would maybe be if I were to be. Maybe Ambience does the same. The other vision of the world is Epic is just the indestructible whale. They have enough resources to build some of this stuff themselves.

In your view, does Abridge exist in five years? Does Ambience exist if they're the best product, and what do they look like? Do they just get swallowed up at some point for less than they're worth today by these companies and ultimately white-labeled? What happens to the, let's call them down market, smaller EHRs that aren't Epic or Cerner? Paint me the picture of how you see this playing out in five years.

**Expert:**
I think the vendors that have been diversifying for a couple of years now, within the past year who have gotten onto the MEDITECHs of the world, have gotten onto the ECWs, the Allscripts, the Oracle Cerners. Those that can be a potluck of all the different types of EHRs that are out there are going to be mostly unaffected by the Epic news because they all can do Epic, but they have other lines of places that they can be very successful at and differentiate themselves.

I think there will always be a flavor of somebody who likes the personalization, likes some of the customized workflows you can get from these third-party vendors. You can bet, and they know it for a fact that the Abridges of the world were really trying to get at MEDITECH saying, "Hey, we want to get integration to you. We want to get into Oracle Cerner."

They're really trying hard to get onto athena. To me, that's a tell because they realize that there is going to be a market crunch from their tool that only exists in Epic today, and yes, it may be in a category that is a notch above what Epic can develop themselves over the next calendar year. Is it worth paying for? If I'm already paying a freight for Epic, I might just be better off keeping Epic and dealing with the other pieces that it doesn't do. I'm not paying that much more for it.

My painting the picture would be the vendors that have created better integration, go into other types of care settings, are the ones that are going to be the most satisfactory sticking around here and holding on for a long time. Somebody mentioned to me their day of wouldn't it make sense if Oracle Cerner and Abridge partnered up much like we saw with Microsoft and Epic? I would tell you, knowing what I've seen of the Oracle product.

**Client:**
You mean Cerner and Ambience?

**Expert:**
Oracle and Abridge. I was thinking work on Abridge because somebody's like, "What happens to Abridge now? Where do they go?" I don't think Oracle needs them. They've got a decent enough tool now. I think, to me, and Oracle's for the most part, I will tell you, it has walled off every integration vendor except for two. Two have found a way to get in the back door and it's working.

Again, I don't think that they're going to be really trying to pick up Abridge's business. Why? Because they've got their own homegrown tool that's relatively decent, and they will never shake any customers that Abridge has today because nobody is ever going to leave Epic to go to Oracle Cerner. There's not a big piece of why Oracle would need Abridge.

I think you're going to see this whole funneling of money and this, "Hey, we've got $750 million that we've had investors give us." You're going to see a slowdown significantly here, mostly on your Abridge side. You'll still see some others who are developing on these other EHRs or care settings. There's going to be a crunch here now because according to Epic yesterday, they'll have it in quarter one. They'll be ready to go with.

**Microsoft's tool.**

Again, somebody will want to adopt it first and see what it's like. If they coming with the Dragon Copilot Intel today, to me, that skips a few of those "Oh, they still got to get their feet wet. They still got to come up with it." Dragon's been doing this for years. They've always been the highest price is the reason why you didn't pick them. They've been doing this for years, and they were the first to do this. The model has relatively already been created. Now, you're seeing nursing AI. You're seeing additional flavors of AI that you can get just from Epic alone.

**Client**
In this version of the world, why do you think Ambience sticks around? You're saying they have better integrations. What does that look like? I think the biggest question here is, I'm thinking about what you said during this whole call around ROI, that the price people are paying today, in your opinion, isn't being realized. Though, I would imagine you would get pushback from clinicians if you said, "We're going to ditch these tools," or you just think it will be commoditized to the point where it's either offered as a very small add-on by a third party or just offered by the EHR itself for free. Just help me understand why.

**Expert**
I'll give you a real world experience. We decided to terminate our DAX contract that we had in a market with 25 providers after using it for two and a half years. That market.

**Client**
DAX is?

**Expert**
Microsoft. Microsoft Dragon Copilot. We told them, "Hey, we are going to need to flip you to an alternative product potentially with better offering. Maybe it comes with coding, and we just want your support." They all were supportive. Why? Because you weren't taking the AI initiative away from them, whatever it was called. They're indifferent to what it's called. They just want to know that the workflow is similar and if I give them a better yield, if I give them specialty overlay onto their specialties, all of that is a motivation for them to go crazy. I love it.

Behind the scenes, I'm saying, "I went from spending over $400 in that market a month to $125 and I got in the same, if not a better product, same integration. I saved hundreds of dollars in every one of those per month." The providers just want the AI solution. If it's the different app that they have to download to get the same experience if not a better one, they have little to no difficulty adjusting. Why does Ambience sticks around? Only because they built a lot of additional down cycle.

I'm thinking mid-cycle here. Clinical encounters to me are in the mid-cycle of RCM. What they've been able to start to build out is they're saying they can do CDI. CDI in the outpatient space is just called coding. CDI and inpatient is very different. If they're really good at coding, they're really good at clinical decision support. I've seen their model two weeks ago. It's very impressive. They're leaning further and further into extraction of that record, either creating orders that are mapped in the EHR, which skip the provider having to go search.

They're leaning into that referral management piece of this and you could say, "Well, the other vendors are going to do this too." Sure, but they're out in front of it. They've got a good name. They've got strong backing, and they are really pushing forward with models that have some stickiness because you don't mess around with your coding unless you're sure who you're switching to is reliable. They're building that belief in what they have, which is to their credit.

**Client**
If you had to make a bet, obviously, I won't hold you to it in no way, but which of these, if any, would you invest in and say, "Oh yeah, okay, that could be a big company on the order of magnitude that the EHRs are today"?

# Expert Insights on EHRs and ROI

## Expert Commentary
On the order of the EHRs? No, I can't see any of them. What I would say is, who is best positioned today with the recent news? I would put **Ambience**. I put **Commure** because Commure has a significant backing. They deal with all the most difficult EHRs that nobody likes to talk about that exist. They've created integration. It's to their credit. They've got really strong engineers, and they are backed by General Catalyst, which is not a bad place to be.

I'm going to put them there. I'm going to put **Nabla** as well because Nabla creates a really diversified type of a product that works in a lot of the niche EHRs. Again, that's a good place to be because they've been there for a while. **Suki**. Not a fan of Suki from an end user perspective, but they've done well with integrating to a variety of EHRs. They've leaned into open evidence with a partnership there. I flipped my list. I put **Abridge** five. I put **Suki** four. I put **Nabla** three.

**Commure**, two, because Commure deals with **UHS**. They deal with **HCA**. They deal with **Tenet**, all the big players that have really complex tech ecosystems. I put **Ambience** number one, but not that far ahead. It's just they've got a robust platform with a lot of compelling, valuable ROI. Seeing it in the inpatient will be the big tell. Who really solidifies what the inpatient model looks like?

To me, I have a much easier story telling somebody, "I want to give this to my acute providers because I can show a really clean ROI." I can tap into so many more features that I need on the acute side if a vendor really matures there. Right now, I'm just scratching the surface of pushing vendors there. I'm pushing them. They aren't pushing me. I'm pushing them to say, "Let's go, I got to have you in my acute space. I got a women's health provider who's leaving my market at the end of the year if you don't help me." They're coming along with me with, "Hey, we're early. I know, I'll help you."

## Client Inquiry
If we said what Ambience and Commure do, if you break it down to the documentation and scribe, then there's RCM and maybe building more practice management on there, how would you rank which ones of those drive the most ROI? It sounds like you're saying it's RCM by a mile.

### Expert Response
**It's RCM.**

## Client Follow-up
I said tell me if I missed anything there.

### Expert Clarification
No, I would say the scope of the offering. What makes Commure really compelling is they've got AI agents. They own their own RCM. They got a fellows. They've got **Memora Health**, which is patient journeys, pay clinical navigation. They have a really robust platform with AI included. If you're a vendor that's looking for a whole potluck of things that can connect, they've got the supermarket of things that you could have.

You're right. These tools are never going to be RCM, because they'll play a bigger piece in the outpatient because it's all transactional. It's all provider billing of, "Hey, I saw this patient. I made $200. Here's my code. Here's my procedure code. Bill it out." That'll never replace your RCM in the inpatient side because there are so many additional bills that hit.

If you can tie yourself closer to coding and I can say, "Well, I can get rid of that staff that I have or vendor that used to do it for me. I could potentially bill faster now because when a doctor signs his note, the codes are right there and we could bill out within 24 hours, not take 72, because somebody's got to review the note." That, to me, is how you tell a big story in the outpatient space of how these tools could be more valuable from Ambience's perspective, and then Commure because it can help you with patient scheduling, call centers, AI to help documentation, RCM on top of it, and they got Memora. That's a big story to tell.

## Client Conclusion
You're as close as people get. Again, not holding you to this. Are those solutions where you would, not...

**Expert Discussion on Valuation and Market Dynamics**

**Expert**
I think the news that happened two weeks ago, what Oracle Cerner is doing right now, it puts a little bit of a ceiling on all these vendors to act independently forever. Could they join forces? Could Ambience say, "You know what, let's buy Nabla up because we need more ammo. We need more EHR integration." I think you're going to see a little bit of these vendors swallowing up few of each other, only to make their product more sticky to stay around. It's going to have to.

I went to HIMSS three or four months ago, and there were about 40 different AI vendors. We haven't even talked about a vendor like DeepScribe. There's a lot of vendors that played niche components here. DeepScribe does really well for oncology. Awesome. Think the world of it. That's your space. There's nowhere to go. I would bet that there is going to continue to be, over this next calendar year, a definite winnowing of who's on the list.

I think we're going to see that evaluations of these vendors that was falsely at a $5.2 billion, whatever it was, that was a pipe dream. If that was out there, should have gotten it real quick because it just makes it that much harder that I never understood why you never wanted to diversify besides what Epic was doing. That, to me, is a problem. I think you're going to see the space really start to slow down with investment. These vendors are probably going to need to think about partnering up or picking one another up.

I think this time next year we're still going to have most of the name vendors that exist. Those that have diversified onto all these different EHR or care setting places are the ones that are going to still be growing. There's going to be a slowdown here because 45% of the market's Epic right now. I would want to be chasing after all that 55% that isn't. I would be going really hard to try to get as much of that as I could because that's where this business is going to move to the next year.

----

**Client**
My hypothesis, and tell me if it's right or wrong. The reason that Abridge is the fastest growing and largest is also the reason that it could be the first to die or the biggest fall.

**Expert**
I genuinely agree with your statement. I think what they've been able to do, they have a PR machine. I think incredibly high of the figurehead. I think incredibly high of him.

**Client**
Obviously, just to be explicit, with the Epic integration and being made.

**Expert**
I think what they've been able to show is all that Epic that they picked up have been your academics, your not for profits, and they've had a great mission statement to build that model. You have seen people encroach and take some of that back. Cleveland Clinic would be one. Houston Methodist would be another. People have left the Abridge side of the house. It isn't like it's a perfect little storm.

I think those that know the space super well you dig into the product differentiators. It's really not that different. What they've been able to lean into is Epic always said them and Microsoft were their preferred vendors. Nobody liked the Microsoft name because it was also the most expensive. They played on that and that got them further along. Why they didn't see this coming? I know they tried to put the prior auth and other things out there recently.

When I would have these calls a year ago and somebody would ask me, "What do you think that was?" I didn't know what the inner workings of what that decision was. They never wanted to get another EHRs. I think, to me, it was a business move. Clearly, it was one thinking that maybe they were going to be the ones that Microsoft is today.

**Epic went around them and goes, "We know Microsoft is never going to be a competitor of ours. We know they have no interest in building your own EHR." That, to me, is probably why they went and did what they did because you would have thought Abridge tells a much better story that aligns with the Epic mission. Microsoft doesn't. If you dig in, it's a business decision. That's why they did what they did with Epic.**

**Client**
You kill Abridge before they can start working towards that vision of the world where I told you, they become the next AI-native EHR.

**Expert**
Yeah. The only vendor I see out there who's interested in building an EHR is Palantir. Know Palantir super well. They've thought about building an EHR. They've come to the realization it's too difficult to build out the intricacies here.

I don't think a scribe vendor who just plays in one segment right now has nothing in patient registration or denial submission. If you're just dealing with documentation, that is just one sliver of the entire EHR ecosystem. Palantir would be better to do it than Abridge. I know Palantir doesn't want to do that. They want to buy somebody and do it instead.

**Client**
I'm going to have to run in a minute, but anything else based on the questions I've asked that you think that I should know before we leave?

**Expert**
No, but I know there are other vendors on that list. Tandem as well. All those niche, they serve a spot but there's such a low ceiling. I don't want to think that I don't value what they do. It's just they're not going to register at a level that somebody's going to say is compelling simply because the walls of deterrence is up, and healthcare systems are looking for a vendor to help on across the eco.
**Sean Doolan**
Not just help me with home health or certain type of nursing. You have to have a provider pay for the nursing AI piece of this to really unfold, which there's a lot of use cases for nursing AI. You've got to figure out the pay for which remains a significant challenge.

**Client**
Thank you for taking the time to speak with me. Have a nice day.
