**Team:** 15 total FTEs. Recently brought on Wayne Grodsky, a Chief Commercial Officer who's grown the $10 → $100M ARR stage three times, including with a Sequoia-backed healthcare revenue cycle tech company.

**Sales:** After a strong 2022 and Q1 2023, SmarterDx is currently at ~$3M in ARR and has 13 hospitals (worth about $12M in ACV) in the Assessment (Retrospective Review) stage or further.

**Product:** SDX's first product focused on pre-bill CDI review has demonstrated improved precision (while maintaining high recall) as the company continues to collect data from paying customers to improve its algorithm. Given the company's access to clinical and financial data and initial GTM wedge, customers are pulling SDX into adjacent areas. Some of these areas include denials and appeals, outpatient CDI, compliance, and surgical authorization. SDX is also exploring how LLMs can unlock additional layers of value by automatically populating physician queries for CDI or auto-populating denial and appeal letters sent to insurers.

## Revisiting Opportunities/Risks from the Seed

| Founding team               | Our early hypothesis that SDX's clinical and data science expertise drives unique value has been validated with strong customer feedback (e.g., Genesis) from sales conversations. Teams that are only technical (e.g., Fathom) fail to communicate the clinical nuances that drive value to health systems. This dual technical and clinical DNA has not only driven sales conversations, but directly informed product development to improve sensitivity/specificity for its CDI product (e.g., training is based on manually labeled data that requires clinical expertise).                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Early traction              | A majority of 2023 was driven by the foundation laid by the team in 2021 and early 2022. While initial customer feedback was strong and early contracts (e.g., White Plains) were extremely positive, the team exceeded all of our expectations with its early revenue ramp.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Margin Profile              | SDX gross margin for 2022 was 76%, which was in line with our 70-80% gross margin target at the seed. To get larger, referenceable customers early on, SDX lowered its contingency rate from 20% to 10% or lower for some customers. Expanding this contingency rate to 20% for all new customers is low-hanging fruit to expand margins even more and is justified given the early performance of its CDI product. |

| Trojan horse into broader opportunity | At the time of seed financing, SDX's plan was to determine how to *push* into adjacent product areas. Over the last 12 months, SDX has been actively *pulled* into adjacent product areas (denials/appeals, compliance, outpatient CDI, surgical authorization), which exceeded our expectations.                                                                        |

| Scaling GTM / Defining Repeatable Sales Strategy | GTM and a repeatable sales strategy continue to be key risks for the team going forward, but Michael and Josh have grown as leaders of the business to recognize their weaknesses and bring on top talent. They replaced their former head of BD/sales and brought on Wayne Grodsky, a Chief Commercial Officer who's grown the $10 → $100M ARR stage three times, including with a Sequoia-backed healthcare revenue cycle tech company.                                                                                                                   |
| Platform vs. Best of Breed             | A major question we had at the seed was - will customers adopt SDX as best-in-breed pre-bill review solution or stay with broader incumbent platforms (Optum, 3M, etc). The product performance compared to these incumbents has spoken for itself in sales conversations and gives us confidence they can maintain this positioning over time. |

## Case for 10X
With every reinvestment, we use our privileged access and position with management teams to re-underwrite our investment case to ensure 10x potential from its current valuation. SDX can raise a subsequent round at a 2-3x step-up by expanding its current pre-bill review product alone ($18M in projected CARR in '24). It can 10x from its current valuation by reaching $50M in CARR with expansion into additional product lines. SDX has positioned itself strategically at the nexus of valuable clinical and financial data from health systems. This

positioning gives them a wedge into a $100B+ market with multiple product expansion opportunities.
