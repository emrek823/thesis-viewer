# Clinical/Commercial SaaS Wins; Preclinical Burns Cash; Data Moats Are Dead

**The take:** If you're building pharma SaaS, pick your layer carefully. Clinical trial ops and commercial software (Veeva model) generate 74% gross margins and 25% operating margins. Preclinical drug discovery platforms (Recursion, Schrödinger) remain unprofitable science projects despite $2B+ valuations. The future of RWD isn't captive data ownership—Flatiron's $3.2B impairment proves that model is broken. Datavant's neutral infrastructure play ($1B+ revenue, profitable) is winning. The actual moat isn't data volume—it's **regulatory quality requirements** and **workflow integration depth**.

**Confidence:** HIGH — validated across vault operator interviews, public financials, and recent market moves.

## 1. Clinical/Commercial vs. Preclinical: Not Even Close

### The Numbers Tell the Story

| Company | Segment | Gross Margin | Operating Margin | Retention | Profitable? |
|---------|---------|--------------|------------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Veeva** | Clinical/Commercial | 74% (85% subs) | 25% GAAP | 95%+ | Yes |
| **Medidata** (Dassault) | Clinical EDC | ~70% est. | 36% (segment) | High | Yes |
| **Schrödinger** | Preclinical Compute | 73-75% | **Negative** | N/A | **No** |
| **Recursion** | Preclinical AI | N/A | **Negative** | N/A | **No** (20% layoffs) |

### Why Preclinical Economics Are Broken

Recursion's CEO claims they can go "from target identification to IND in 18 months vs. 42 months industry standard" and "$10-20M instead of hundreds of millions" — but this remains **unproven**. Key facts:

- **Zero FDA approvals** from AI-discovered drugs at Recursion, Schrödinger, or peers
- Recursion Q3 2025 revenue: **$5.2M** (vs. $26.1M Q3 2024 — 80% decline)
- REC-994 (lead asset) **discontinued** May 2025 after long-term data failed
- 20% workforce reduction to extend runway to 2027

[[Recursion Pharmaceuticals: The AI Drug Discovery Play](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/recursion-pharmaceuticals-ai-drug-discovery-play)]

**The structural problem:** Preclinical software is selling to biotech companies that mostly die. Vault evidence confirms:

> "These are companies who, generally speaking, will die. Most of them will die or be consolidated."
> — [[Director at a Pharmaceutical Therapeutics Company _ Greenphire _ Tegus]]

Clinical/commercial software sells to the 50 companies that survive—and they pay for decades.

### Investment Implication

If you're not selling something to help make a better drug (which requires surviving drug candidates), you're selling to corpses. Clinical trial ops (Slope, Auxilius, Greenphire) and commercial (Veeva, IQVIA) have real buyers with real budgets. Preclinical compute is a VC science experiment until someone gets an FDA approval.

## 2. RWD Future: Captive Data Models Are Dying

### The Flatiron Lesson ($3.2B Impairment)

Roche bought Flatiron for $1.9B in 2018 believing captive data = strategic advantage. By 2024:

- **$3.2B total impairment** (Flatiron + Spark combined)
- Roche exploring sale with Citigroup
- **Core problem:** "Flatiron's association with Roche has deterred some rival drugmakers from engaging with the company, thereby affecting its sales"

[[Roche's Strategic Crossroads: Evaluating the Future of Flatiron Health](https://hlth.com/insights/articles/roche-s-strategic-crossroads-evaluating-the-future-of-flatiron-health-2024-08-12)]

**Why captive fails:**
1. **Ownership paradox**: Controlling data limits value when competitors won't share
2. **Market perception**: Independence on paper ≠ independence in buyer minds
3. **Cultural misalignment**: Pharma acquiring tech startups creates friction

### The Datavant Model (Neutral Infrastructure Wins)

Datavant took the opposite approach: become the **pipes**, not the **oil**.

- **$1B+ revenue in 2025**, profitable, cash-flow positive
- Acquired Aetion (July 2025) for end-to-end RWE platform
- 300+ data partners (EHRs, claims, specialty pharmacy, registries, imaging, lab, SDOH)
- Strategy: "Create a bridge between different datasets... transform how data is leveraged across drug development continuum"

[[Datavant Completes Acquisition of Aetion](https://www.datavant.com/press-release/datavant-completes-acquisition-of-aetion)]

**Why neutral wins:**
- Pharma companies will share data through neutral broker, not competitor's subsidiary
- Infrastructure lock-in (tokenization, PPRL, linkage) without ownership conflict
- More data partners = better quality = more regulatory acceptance

### Tempus: The Middle Path

Tempus tries to have it both ways: diagnostics lab (tests) + data licensing (access).

- 38M research records, 7B clinical notes, 1M+ cancer patients with molecular profiling
- Launched proprietary LLM Agent Infrastructure (Agent Builder) for unstructured healthcare data
- Path to EBITDA profitability in 2025

[[Tempus AI: At the Crossroads of Diagnostics and Data](https://mlq.ai/research/tempus-ai-tem-deep-dive/)]

**The risk:** If FDA formalizes that raw data volume isn't sufficient for regulatory submissions (which our thesis argues), Tempus faces commoditization. Their edge is **diagnostics lock-in** (test ordering relationships), not data volume.

### What LLMs Change

LLMs don't make captive data more valuable—they make **data quality infrastructure** more valuable. Flatiron already validated this:

> "We developed the VALID Framework to evaluate model-extracted data quality—to our knowledge, the first comprehensive validation framework for model-extracted data in the oncology industry."

[[Can You Trust Real-World Data Extracted by a Large Language Model?](https://resources.flatiron.com/real-world-evidence/can-you-trust-real-world-data-extracted-by-a-large-language-model-llm)]

The insight: LLMs can extract data from anywhere. **Validation and regulatory acceptance** become the moat, not raw data ownership.

---

## 3. The Actual Moat Framework

### Data Moats Are Dead

> "AI has turned data from a moat into a commodity. In vertical SaaS, real defensibility now comes from owning the workflow where the business actually runs."

[[Forget the Data Moat: The Workflow is Your Fortress in Vertical SaaS](https://www.vendep.com/post/forget-the-data-moat-the-workflow-is-your-fortress-in-vertical-saas)]

The argument:
- **From below (LLM commoditization)**: AI features once requiring months to build can now be replicated through clever prompts
- **From above (operator disintermediation)**: AI-native operators acquire local providers, controlling entire operations

### The Three Real Moats in Pharma SaaS

**1. Regulatory Quality Gatekeeping (STRONGEST)**

Vault evidence from [[Real-World Data Infrastructure Becomes Pharma Critical Path—Data Quality Beats Volume by 2028.md]]:

> "FDA's RWD guidance requires: (1) Computable phenotypes, (2) Data validation with accuracy/completeness documentation, (3) Distributed data networks, (4) Common Data Models (OMOP, Sentinel), (5) QA/QC audit trails for regulatory submissions. Raw data aggregators fail these requirements."

**Why this is the strongest moat:** It's not about switching costs—it's about **market access**. If FDA doesn't accept your data quality, you have no product. Datavant/Veeva/validated RWD infrastructure can't be replaced because regulators explicitly require it.

**2. Workflow Integration Depth (STRONG)**

Vault evidence from [[Emre Karatas _ Matt Vail - 30 Min Video Call.md]]:

> "We chose Tennr because they had a lot of experience API into Brightree... It's really not something you learned."

This creates:
- **2-3 month customization** for specialty rules (retina 28-day spacing, ortho body-part routing)
- **Staffing dependency** (ops teams trained on specific workflows)
- **Data accumulation** (scenario modeling improves with every customer)

Vault evidence from [[Healthcare Platform Consolidation Compresses Sales Cycles—Workflow Unification Beats Point Solutions by 2028.md]]:

> "Platform consolidation compresses cycles dramatically... Before: 6-9 month sales cycles, cost-plus pricing. After platform launch: <30 days, value-based pricing ($200K per measure vs. cost-plus). 80% gross margins, 50% OPEX margins."

**Why workflow beats data:** Systems of record are useful but optional. **Systems of consequence** (software so embedded that failure halts work) are irreplaceable. Procore evolved from tracking progress to managing finances, bidding, compliance—now irreplaceable.

**3. Switching Costs (WEAKEST — with a caveat)**

Vault evidence from [[Pharma Platform Switching Costs Lock In Veeva-IQVIA—Field Force Reduction Creates Revenue Headwind by 2028.md]]:

> "Changing CRM systems with 2,000-person field forces requires 1+ month training... Only justified for game-changing technology."

**The caveat:** Lock-in doesn't guarantee pricing power. Veeva has switching costs but faces structural revenue headwind from 20-30% field force reductions post-COVID. Lock-in prevents churn but doesn't prevent revenue decline.

### Moat Hierarchy by Pharma Layer

| Layer | Moat Type | Example | Durability |
|-------|-----------|---------|------------|
| **Preclinical (Discovery)** | Clinical outcome data | Recursion OS, Tempus data | LOW (unproven, commoditizing) |
| **Clinical (Trial Ops)** | Scenario modeling data + workflow | Auxilius, Slope, Medidata Rave | MEDIUM (CRO bundling risk) |
| **Clinical (RWD)** | Regulatory quality infrastructure | Datavant, Veeva RWD | HIGH (FDA gatekeeping) |
| **Commercial (Field Force)** | Switching costs | Veeva CRM, IQVIA | MEDIUM (shrinking base) |
| **Payer Infrastructure** | Workflow consolidation | Valleysteer model | HIGH (sales cycle compression) |

## 4. Synthesis: What Actually Wins

### The Winners

1. **Regulatory quality infrastructure** (Datavant + Aetion model)
   - Neutral positioning avoids Flatiron's ownership paradox
   - FDA requirements create hard gatekeeping
   - $1B+ revenue, profitable

2. **Clinical trial operations** (Slope, Auxilius, Greenphire)
   - 5,950/6,000 companies still on Excel (massive TAM)
   - 800% growth at Auxilius proves demand
   - Data moat accrues through scenario modeling
   - Risk: 3-5 year window before CRO bundling

3. **Workflow consolidation platforms** (Veeva Vault, Valleysteer model)
   - Integration depth creates operational dependency
   - Sales cycle compression (6-9 months → <30 days)
   - Value-based pricing power ($200K per measure)

### The Losers

1. **Captive data models** (Flatiron inside Roche)
   - Ownership paradox deters competitive engagement
   - $3.2B impairment proves model failure

2. **Preclinical compute platforms** (Recursion, Schrödinger as pure-play)
   - Zero FDA approvals despite $2B+ valuations
   - Selling to customers that mostly die
   - 20% workforce cuts, revenue collapsing

3. **Raw data aggregators** (volume without quality)
   - FDA formalizing quality requirements
   - Volume without validation = worthless for regulatory submissions
   - LLMs commoditize extraction; validation is the moat

## Contradictions & Open Questions

### Unresolved: Tempus Dual Model

Tempus tries to have both diagnostics lock-in (tests) and data licensing (access). The question: **Does diagnostics lock-in protect data licensing, or will data licensing commoditize as LLMs extract from distributed sources?**

Our thesis leans toward: diagnostics creates the lock-in, data licensing is a bonus. But this needs monitoring.

### Unresolved: CRO Bundling Timeline

Point solutions (Auxilius, Slope) show exceptional growth but face CRO bundling threat. **How fast will IQVIA/PPD/Parexel move?** Vault evidence suggests 3-5 year window, but Thermo Fisher's $8.875B Clario acquisition accelerates timeline.

### Unresolved: Field Force Trajectory

Veeva/IQVIA switching costs are real but base is shrinking. **Does per-rep decline stabilize, or accelerate?** If field forces cut another 20-30%, even lock-in doesn't save the model.

---

## Recommendations

1. **Update Biotech Ops thesis** — Add explicit layer distinction: preclinical (outcome data, weak moat) vs. clinical trial ops (scenario modeling + workflow, medium moat) vs. clinical RWD (regulatory quality, strong moat)

2. **Create new thesis: RWD Infrastructure** — "Neutral Data Infrastructure Beats Captive Models—Datavant/Veeva Win as FDA Formalizes Quality Requirements by 2028"

3. **Monitor Tempus IPO** — Test whether diagnostics lock-in protects data licensing or whether data commoditizes

4. **De-emphasize preclinical compute** — Until someone gets FDA approval on AI-discovered drug, this is science experiment, not investable SaaS

**Bull case:** FDA aggressively formalizes RWD quality requirements, accelerating regulatory infrastructure moat. Workflow consolidation continues compressing sales cycles.

**Bear case:** LLMs commoditize validation (not just extraction), eliminating quality infrastructure moat. CRO bundling accelerates faster than expected, crushing point solutions.
