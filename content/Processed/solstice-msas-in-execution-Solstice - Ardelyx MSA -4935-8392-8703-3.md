## Confidential Information; Ardelyx Materials

### Definition

The term “Confidential Information” includes all non-public information disclosed by or on behalf of a party (“Disclosing Party”) to the other party (“Recipient”) under this Agreement that would be reasonably understood to be confidential given the nature of the information or the circumstances surrounding its disclosure. Confidential Information may include information relating to Ardelyx’s products, programs, businesses, operations or technologies, including without limitation, including the Materials, whether or not labeled “Confidential,” and any information developed by Service Provider in performance of work under this Agreement including, but not limited to, the Work Product and Project Inventions. However, the term “Confidential Information” does not include information that (a) is publicly known at the Effective Date or later becomes publicly known under circumstances involving no breach of this Agreement, (b) is lawfully and in good faith disclosed to Recipient without an obligation of confidence by a third party who is not subject to a confidentiality obligation to Disclosing Party, (c) is independently developed by or on behalf of Recipient without use of Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information as evidenced by its written records; or (d) by a mutual written agreement by the parties, is released from confidential status.

### Confidentiality Obligation

Recipient acknowledges that Disclosing Party is and will remain the sole owner of Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information. During the term of this Agreement and for a period of ten (10) years thereafter, Recipient will take all commercially reasonable precautions to protect the confidentiality of Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information, and will not disclose or use any of Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information except as necessary to perform the Services or exercise the Recipient’s rights expressly set forth in this Agreement. In particular, Service Provider may disclose Confidential Information to Service Provider Personnel who need to know such Confidential Information in order to provide the Services and who are obligated, in writing or by other obligation, to protect the confidentiality of such Confidential Information under terms no less stringent than those set forth in this Article 6. If required by law, Recipient may disclose Confidential Information to a governmental authority, provided that Recipient (to the extent legally permitted) provides prompt notice of such legal requirement to Disclosing Party and provided further that Recipient will take reasonable and lawful actions to avoid or minimize the extent of such disclosure. Information disclosed in this manner shall remain Confidential Information for all other purposes hereunder.

### Information Security

Service Provider represents and warrants that it has documented organizational information security policies, standards and/or procedures in place to protect the confidentiality, availability and integrity of Confidential Information, as defined above, which includes a procedure or process for identifying threats and vulnerabilities to their information system(s) and training their personnel accordingly. Without limiting the foregoing:

*   Service Provider agrees that it will establish, maintain, and periodically test assess and evaluate effectiveness of appropriate organizational, technical, and physical measures designed to protect against unauthorized access, destruction, loss, deletion, disclosure, alteration, or co-mingling of Ardelyx Confidential Information under Service Provider's control that are compliant with applicable laws and at a minimum no less rigorous than applicable industry standards and practices.
*   Service Provider shall notify Ardelyx within forty-eight (48) hours in writing via email at <mailto:support@ardelyx.com> support@ardelyx.com should it become aware of or reasonably suspect (a) any significant security incident or vulnerability, or (b) that a data breach has occurred, in each case, that affects Ardelyx’s Confidential Information. Service Provider agrees to promptly provide reasonable assistance as necessary to investigate and enable Ardelyx to notify relevant data breaches to competent authorities if required by law.
*   Service Provider agrees that any and all transmission or exchange of system data with Ardelyx and any approved third parties shall take place via secure means (e.g. https. FTPS, SFTP, TLS, or equivalent means). Service Provider agrees that all confidential and proprietary data related to and about Ardelyx, its systems and applications, including access information such as user ID and passwords, access tokens, and keys that are stored on the Service Provider's systems will be stored in an encrypted form using a commercially supported encryption solution.
*   Ardelyx shall be entitled from time to time during the Term, and until such time as Ardelyx Confidential Information is returned to Ardelyx following expiration or termination of this Agreement, to request that Service Provider supplement the security procedures enforced by Service Provider. Any such change or supplementation will be documented, specified, and mutually agreed upon in an applicable Statement of Work or Change Order. Where Service Provider provides Ardelyx, their employees, or agents and contractors access to Service Provider systems with password or other access restrictions, including restrictions to prevent unauthorized access to portions of Service Provider systems, Ardelyx agrees to abide by all reasonable data security policies imposed by Service Provider.
*   In the event that any Statement of Work involves exchange of Protected Health Information, as defined in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, the parties will execute Ardelyx’s standard form of business associate agreement, subject to such modifications as the parties may mutually agree.

### IT Audit

Upon providing 30 days prior written notice to Service Provider, Ardelyx shall have the right to conduct a security audit during normal business hours of Service Provider’s compliance with the foregoing security provisions no more frequently than once per year; provided that such audit shall not create any undue disruption to Service Provider’s operations and is conducted in accordance with mutually agreed upon terms and scope. A report of the audit findings shall be issued within a thirty (30) day period, or as soon thereafter as is practicable. Such audit shall be conducted by Ardelyx’s auditors, or an appointed designee of Ardelyx’s choosing, that are reasonably acceptable to Service Provider and subject to appropriate confidentiality obligations. Service Provider has the option, at Service Provider’s own cost, to engage an agreed upon independent auditor, to work in conjunction with Ardelyx’s auditors. If the independent Third Party auditor recommends additional security measures after completion of the audit, Ardelyx and Service Provider shall jointly determine how best to respond to such recommendation.

## Indemnification and Insurance

A party intending to claim indemnification under this Agreement (“Indemnitee”) shall promptly notify the indemnifying party (“Indemnitor”) in writing of any claim, lawsuit or other action in respect of which the Indemnitee intends to claim such indemnification; provided, however, that the failure to provide such prompt notice shall not affect a party’s rights to indemnification if such failure to deliver notice does not materially prejudice the Indemnitor’s ability to defend the claim. The Indemnitee shall cooperate with the Indemnitor in the defense of the claim, and the Indemnitor shall have the sole and exclusive right to control the defense and/or settlement of the claim. The Indemnitor will not be liable for any Liabilities associated with the settlement of any claim or action against the Indemnitee unless the Indemnitor has received prior notice of the settlement and has agreed in writing to the terms of the settlement (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned). The Indemnitee will provide reasonable cooperation and information in furtherance of such defense and settlement, as reasonably required by the Indemnitor and at the Indemnitor’s expense.
