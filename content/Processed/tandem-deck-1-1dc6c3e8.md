## Slide 1: $600B+ on Rx and the growing majority is high-cost ($500+/mo) brand drugs

### Chart: Total Rx Spend by Year

| Year | Branded ($B) | Generic ($B) | Total ($B) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2017 | 369 | 92 | 461 |
| 2018 | 384 | 96 | 480 |
| 2019 | 407 | 95 | 502 |
| 2020 | 427 | 94 | 521 |
| 2021 | 477 | 96 | 573 |
| 2022 | 515 | 88 | 603 |
| 2023 | 541 | 92 | 633 |

Brand drugs are gate-kept by insurers, creating acute, recurring problems for all

*   **Patients lose on access**
    *   **37%** of Rx abandoned due to delays and denials
*   **Providers lose on time**
    *   **14 hrs** per week spent per provider on process
*   **Manufacturers lose sales**
    *   **$250B+** in lost revenue due to non-adherence

## Slide 2: Patient access complexity is the #1 problem for pharma commercialization

CONFIDENTIAL AND TRADE SECRET - NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION 4

Pharma spends $232B on US commercialization, with $32B on access support al

### Chart: Total Pharma S&M Spend (100% = $232B)

| Category             | Value ($B) |
|:---------------------|:-----------|
| Patient Access       | 32         |
| Provider Education   | 19         |
| DTC Advertising      | 22         |
| Pharma Sales Reps    | 59         |
| PBM/Plan Rebates     | 100        |
| **Total Pharma S&M Spend** | **232**    |

5%+ of revenue is spent on Hub Services & Patient Assistance
"Hub services" are primarily high-cost call centers with hundreds of people, yet this is the highest-ROI activity in budget.

## Slide 3: Today's access support is fragmented and burdensome to use, inhibiting adoption

*   **Diagram showing fragmented access support:**
    *   Each drug (Cosentyx, Enbrel, RINVOQ) combined with a payer (Aetna, CareFirst, Cigna) leads to a "Different insurance process for each drug / payer combination".
    *   These processes then interact with specialty pharmacies (CVS Specialty, Accredo).
    *   Ultimately, "Pharma 'hub services' persist similar fragmentation", illustrated by multiple specific forms for RINVOQ (Rheumatology, Gastroenterology, Dermatology-Adults, Dermatology-Pediatrics).

LLMs enable automation for 10X+ better cost structure while improving performa

### Flowchart: LLM-Enabled Automation

*   **Get insurance requirements**
    *   Insurance extraction from ID card images via OCR/LLMs
    *   PBM and PA form matching using rules+history
    *   Eligibility and benefit checks via LLMs (eg, synthetic calls)
*   **Collect + clean health records**
    *   Clinical entity extraction from records via OCR/LLMs
    *   Historical record retrieval via LLMs (eg, synthetic calls)
    *   Medical history search and summaries via LLMs
*   **Complete forms with evidence**
    *   Form / workflow completion via RPA on existing portals
    *   Coverage "strategy" (ie, PA approach) using rules+history
    *   Criteria search, summaries, and answering via LLMs
*   **Monitor status, manage denials**
    *   Response strategy (appeal vs alt.) using rules+history
    *   Appeal letter generation via LLMs with guardrails
    *   Status checks and prompts via LLMs (eg, synthetic calls)

## Slide 4: tandem eliminates complexity by supporting every Rx and drives better access

1.  **Provider can write every Rx to tandem**
    tandem is already in the EHR, so there's no new workflow to learn
2.  **tandem handles all admin complexity**
    No more time-intensive labor of paperwork and phone calls
3.  **Patients get meds more often and faster**
    tandem improves coverage and affordability by double-digit rates

Our form and freemium enable rapid distribution to achieve ubiquity with provider

*   **Image Caption:** "Just prescribe to tandem via EHR—no other steps required!"
*   **Image Content:** A screenshot of an electronic health record (EHR) interface showing a medication order form for "TANDEM PHARMACY" with fields for address, operation, etc., indicating integration within a clinical workflow.

1.  **Adaptable to any provider setup**
    *   Form factor puts us in existing EHR pipes
2.  **Agnostic to drug, payer, and pharmacy**
    *   AI changes cost structure to create flexibility
3.  **Zero time-to-value for users**
    *   Immediately usable by any provider

## Slide 5: Providers using tandem get patients on therapy faster and more consistently

| Practice   | Specialty   | Insurance Coverage lift         | Time to Access reduction | EV lift (per brand Rx) |
|:-----------|:------------|:--------------------------------|:-------------------------|:-----------------------|
| Practice 1 | Neurology   | 60% → 82% (final approval rate) | 7+ days → 3 days         | ~$1300 per Rx          |
| Practice 2 | Neurology   | 70% → 84% (prior auth approval rate) | 10+ days → 3 days        | ~$700 per Rx           |
| Practice 3 | Dermatology | 75% → 85% (biologic final approval rate) | 14 days → 3 days         | ~$1800 per Rx          |
| Practice 4 | Dermatology | 85% → 94% (biologic final approval rate) | 7 days → 3 days          | ~$1400 per Rx          |

Based on comparison between tandem data and provider-reported baselines at time of onboarding.

With even small improvements in access and guaranteed 10X ROI for pharma, we would generate $38k - $96k revenue / physician in our initial target therapeutic areas

| Metric                     | Median Neurologist | Median Dermatologist |
|:---------------------------|:-------------------|:---------------------|
| Total Rx revenue           | $4,200,000         | $10,500,000          |
| Branded Rx revenue         | $3,800,000         | $9,600,000           |
| 10% lift in branded Rx     | $380,000           | $960,000             |
| 10% capture of lift (10X ROI for pharma) | $38,000            | $96,000              |

## Slide 6: Pharma will pay us for impact, with each contract stacking to create high margins

### Table: Ex: Migraine Neurology ($80/Rx)

| Metric                   | Value     |
|:-------------------------|:----------|
| E2025 cost per prescriber | $140/mo   |
| Brand 1 (12% of Rx)      | $384/mo   |
| Brand 2 (10% of Rx)      | $320/mo   |
| Brand 3 (8% of Rx)       | $256/mo   |
| Monthly revenue          | $960/mo   |
| Revenue run rate         | $11,520/yr |
| Gross profit run rate    | $9,840/yr |

### Chart: Gross margin impact of incremental contracts

| Gross Margin Segment | Percentage |
|:---------------------|:-----------|
| Top Segment          | 85%        |
| Upper Middle Segment | 5%         |
| Lower Middle Segment | 17%        |
| Bottom Segment       | 64%        |
| *Note: Percentages likely represent different tiers or stacked contracts.* |

Our focus is accelerating to ~3500 target providers and $10M+ run rate by E2025

| Metric                     | Neurologists | Dermatologists |
|:---------------------------|:-------------|:---------------|
| Active providers           | 1,697        | 1,788          |
| Total Brand Rx             | 521,760      | 424,080        |
| Share of target Rx         | 13.5%        | 18.7%          |
| Run rate at 1 contract (conservative pricing) | $8.5M        | $2.6M          |

Note: Dermatologists have lower brand concentration but larger total market and faster path to demand aggregation.

## Slide 7: We will build a large network of providers and consumers to unlock more opportu

### Diagram: Business expansion opportunities from Medication access

*   **Medication access**
    *   **More products for pharma**
        *   Commercial and R&D data
        *   DTC advertising
        *   Clinical trial recruitment
    *   **Monetization of other stakeholders**
        *   Specialty pharmacy fees
        *   Retail pharmacy fees
        *   PBM/Plan fees
    *   **More products for consumers**
        *   Provider booking
        *   Insurance plan selection
        *   Out-of-pocket payments

**tandem**
Cutting the red tape between patients + medicine

## Slide 8: We will target high-value drug categories but optimize for rapid provider distributi

### CRITERIA TO CONSIDER

**Critical**
1.  Significant annual spend
2.  High per-unit cost
3.  High prescriber concentration

**Secondary**
4.  High manufacturer competition
5.  Individual manufacturer focus
6.  Manufacturer agility

### TOP SPECIALTIES

*   Neurology (e.g., migraines)
*   Dermatology (e.g., psoriasis)
*   Gastroenterology (e.g., Crohn's)
*   Immunology / Rheumatology (e.g., RA)
*   Pulmonology (e.g., asthma)

If we achieve prescriber volume, manufacturers and others will pay

### Provider testimonial

"
An invaluable resource to our practice since we started our partnership.
Their assistance in navigating the insurance authorization process for
medications is second to none and has directly resulted in a higher
percentage of our patients getting the medications.
"
– **Michael**, General Manager
of partner specialty practice

## Slide 13: Patient testimonial

"
The most effective, expedient, polite interface and advocate I could imagine
as a patient... Interface is flawless, clear and effective. I have already told
my other providers about **tandem**. Seriously, I am blown away and
wondering how you have come onto the scene?
"
– **Barbara**, one of our patients who's
had access issues for over a decade

### SMS quotes

*   **S:** Wow, really?! Florida Blue's third party processor told me there would be no coverage for an out of network provider! How'd you swing that? My co-pay should be something like $10-$20 - which is amazing. That's why I was so concerned about keeping it in-network.
*   **V:** My gosh. You put other pharmacy services to shame. Good news, bad news, I rarely require rx, but be assured that I will spread the word about you to prescribers and patients I know.
*   **S:** That's great! But how did you do it?! I've been battling insurance for family and myself for decades - so I'm baffled!
*   **L:** THANK YOU SO MUCH! I've been using the copay card for 2 months and they've charged me $149 the first time and $98 the second time. I'm so glad you got that straightened out! If it were a different, cheaper med, I'd do the 3 months. I REALLY APPRECIATE you! Thank you so much!
*   **F:** Oh my gosh, this is awesome news!! Thank you SO much for all of your help. I cannot tell you what a relief it is to finally have access to this medication. I struggle so much with navigating all of these different savings programs and applications and jumping through all of the different hoops, so I really can't thank you enough for helping me navigate all of this. All the best :)
*   **S:** Hey there - it appears to be billing right now with a $0 co-pay! How on earth did you swing that? Mind control?! *filling right now
*   **L:** I received emgality today from Duane Reade. Thank you! If there's any way you can persuade optum to get it in stock, that would be amazing as it'll also save me some money. I had a hard time with the last service provider and shared that with Dr. Kaur's practice. I'll be sure to pass on my positive experience with Tandem when I speak with her this week (regardless of whether optum is able to fill or not). Thanks again from saving me from the nightmare I often experience of having to call around to multiple pharmacies on my own. In fact, if you work with a wide variety of different healthcare specialties, I may pass along your info if that's ok
*   **T:** Wow! You wouldn't think it would be this hard to get medication that actually helps... Thank you for all the effort on your part!!
