* The past several years have been focused on expansion on access, not outcomes
* BH now accounts for a disproportionately large amount of health plan spend. Payers are very focused on long-term sustainability of these services.

Onos market opportunity

### Onos Approach
* To drive value, we must focus on a specific specialty
* Each specialty has very unique requirements, so training our model requires data specific to that specialty
* While we may expand into additional service lines in the future, this is not our primary focus at the moment.

Current market solutions don't take a specialty-focused approach, which is why they are **ineffective** code checkers and **waste remains a core challenge.**

## Slide 10: Why now
Why now

1. Cost containment & FWA are very top of mind for plans especially for Behavioral Health leaders
2. Plans are under pressure to leverage solutions that balance outcomes and cost (ensure every dollar goes to the highest quality care)
3. Technology (GenAI & ML) is now where we can actually tackle this at scale
