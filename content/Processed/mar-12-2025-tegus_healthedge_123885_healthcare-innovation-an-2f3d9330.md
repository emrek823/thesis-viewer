**Client**
Thank you for taking the time to speak with me about HealthEdge and some of their larger competitors. To st8art off, could you please give us a quick overview of your background and experience in this space

**Expert**
Let me run this pretty quick. Eleven-year, I am going to call it, veteran of surviving healthcare. I didn't come from this. I don't have any political baggage, which is pretty funny because there is a lot of it. I came into the payer space by Dan Loepp, CEO of Blue Cross, Michigan, who's now retired. Dan and I previously had worked together at State Farm, stood up the first cloud.

He worked with me because State Farm wanted to go into the cloud, which is parallel conversation. He worked so that we could sell, they do today, sell healthcare in all 50 states with 35 Blues. I literally got to work with the CEO. Left, finished our work there, stood up the first U.S. marketing cloud which was for them, came back to Michigan, walk in the door. Payers weren't digital at all. It was all antiquated. You know the rules, data, everything had to be redone. CAP systems, EHR.

I sat between the CIO, the CMO and CDO with my own budget to Dan and built out the many use cases and stood up the first cloud-based health system in the U.S. supported by then it was a claim system that we all inherited. I don't know how much you do or don't know in healthcare but Facets was the game in town. Originally, Facets was hired by TriZetto. We inherited that and then Cognizant.

The reason we went in the cloud was we were needed to become more operable, not just real time. Stood everything up, did the point solutions, launched in 2019, left internally became external as you would imagine and I rinsed and repeated the same system with all the many point solutions at six other payers that I sit today.

My role hasn't changed. I am chief strategy and chief digital officer as more of a consultative but leader with six Blues' plans in the U.S. doing the same work I'm doing today. CAPS, claims, patient journeys, all of this but to keep it operable.

I ride the fence between IT and business but I make multiple decisions on their behalf and keep doing this and happy to talk to you. I can talk for quite a bit about why HealthEdge is becoming ahead of the class versus the rest of them. Happy to fill you in and my question to you is do you come from healthcare just so I don't waste your time, just so I know.

**Client**
Not from an operating perspective. I don't have your level of understanding of the software. Let's put it that way.

**Expert**
That's all. I try to frame it in so you know how things work. I wish we were on Zoom sometime just so I can show you a picture because I think pictures really help this. I don't want to go backwards but I think to understand the whys and the who's and why the differences versus just buying stuff and standing it up. There's a lot of pieces. I will throw it back to you and let you do Q&A and we'll see where this goes.

---

**Client**
You led me where I wanted to go, which was just an assessment of what the landscape of vendors looks like today. I'm vaguely familiar with who the players are and what you alluded to about HealthEdge being the game in town. The ways in which they're better than, say, TriZetto or NASCO or SS&C or the homegrown systems that a lot of the national payers have.

**Expert**
Let me just define a word for you. Cloud. Everybody's cloud and AI. For this conversation I don't really want to get near AI. It doesn't matter for this right now. It really doesn't. You're talking about software. Coming from my background when we really didn't have APIs or SaaS, I've known Mark and his team at Salesforce way too long. Because I did the first marketing cloud has been documented at State Farm, that gave me the understanding.

I didn't come from healthcare, but it's really just data. How do you put members into a cloud and operate them, help them whether you're selling or managing. Healthcare is the same thing. When I wrote this thesis, which I laugh today and I speak about a lot at health is because you're a cloud doesn't mean the world's better. You're more enabled to functionally move data around for you and I as patients.

The end goal is to get you and I in a care, keep you there. That's why we're cloud-based in a near time. Real time, I think is still a farce to be honest. Some companies do better than most. We launched in 2019 to be clear, and here we are in 2025, our way to 2026, phase I had to be completed, meaning that data. When I say data, I mean you and I as patients. All our data had to be in one big data lake in order to operate. Whether you went with Microsoft's cloud, Adobe or Salesforce didn't matter.

The whole reason behind going to a cloud was to move data from a claim. The reason the CAP systems are so critical, it's the first piece of information needs to be grabbed. When you and I get diagnosed from Type two diabetes and all I do is make people sick on this call, but I'll get to my point. When the doctor diagnosed you and you leave, they send their claim in.

The hardest piece of work that no one talks about that a CAP system has to translate is I don't care about reimbursement, it'll get done. I need the diagnosis, treatment, it needs to go up in the cloud. I see, Joe got diagnosed with Type two diabetes, Derek got diagnosed with Type one. Here's the treatment, everything else and we put it in these journeys which are functional plans of care.

If you're prescribed medicine like stick yourself an RPM device. We need to know that. Forget the claim part of it. I need access, I need the cloud. The only way to move efficiently and fast enough through claims is in a cloud system. I had a CIO and a few other people teaching me along the way. I'm pretty smart, but not from healthcare.

Today, to bring it back to you, you've got HealthEdge, you've got Codiviti, you've got TriZetto, which has more. TriZetto bought Facets which everybody and their brother had. That was the incumbent. Everybody has a claim system. TriZetto bought them. Cognizant bought TriZetto. Here we sit today.

TriZetto is the big kid on the block. TriZetto's best asset is they can take on the big monsters, the big Blue Cross L.A., or Anthem. They're better at adapting bigger because they're really not claim. They're building in a cloud system now, but they were always better for bigger because capacity that's starting to change and evolve. Of course, we'll get to HealthEdge.

You also had companies that I would put on your paper there. When we are sculpting this out Zelis, which is payment integrity, which I'd put on the bottom of your paper is integral. It's a big piece of this system that fits in with HealthEdge better than TriZetto, and then of course you have Optum.

We've all used Optum. I've had Optum as a partner, not as a CAP system, but they're my go to around coordinating clinical payment integrity and analytics that goes up in the cloud. It's got the delivery. You've got a couple others like Change Healthcare, which does all risk. For this conversation, that's all we do. You've got about five or six companies that fit within a claim system.

You've got support groups that help build it out. Of course, the name escapes me that HealthEdge has had a partner. I can't think of the company. It's Health something. I know the CEO. We worked with him for five years. Not Health Trello. I'll think of it in a second. My point to you is if you really look into landscape. It's like an element for healthcare. It's comparable to when we first went to member portals. If you hear transparency there's really with two companies, Castlight and HealthSpark.

When you talk CAPS, it's really HealthEdge and TriZetto and I'm not going to badmouth TriZetto, they just haven't kept up. Purely, the number one reason out of all the things they do well, HealthEdge over TriZetto. TriZetto is really good. Their cloud platform fit into our world so much easier and allowed us to move quicker because the game is simple. The minute you get diagnosed I need to know where to put Derek and how to get him into care no matter what you have. It doesn't have to be a really bad disease. That's the game in town.

From a payer perspective, our end goal as long as things are moving along and we're getting the patients, we're bucketing them by the journey you're diagnosed for. It gets us to a point where I can get the value-based care quicker today with HealthEdge versus more the cumbersome way that's TriZetto. That's what we've seen between all the stuff you got unpacked between clinical assessments and patient outcomes. I need it to go right. It's like a package.

I'll pause for a second. I don't want to dump a lot on you. When I'm reviewing for the six payers I oversee, two have converted to HealthEdge. I think TriZetto competitively will catch up and get in the cloud system. They have some other tools with QHN or QNN which is just a product feature of their claim system that you get for TriZetto. For my needs, for the big plans I oversee, for the little ones we do, it just gives us more options to move. To get you into care. For all the other pieces of the puzzle, this ship's complicated, and it's expensive too, and I'm sure you'll get into that.

**Client**
How much of the dynamic you described of HealthEdge versus TriZetto is just that the in-place install base of TriZetto of Facets is mostly the on-prem legacy solutions. If you had to compare apples to apples, the Facets cloud version versus the HealthEdge, is HealthEdge still much stronger?

**Expert**
It is. There're so many pieces of this puzzle. The old Facets system was a nightmare for us. The adjudication part of it was really hard. If you look at the human beings we used to have in place when I walked through the doors. You had human beings looking at claims. The nightmare stories.

If there's one thing that you've heard about digital, the reason that the good things that occurred is that claims were processed better, they were processed quicker. If there was a gap, like if you called up saying, "I got overbilled for this." Simple things like that, we had human beings on a phone that you would literally call claims and say, "Hey, I shouldn't have paid for this or why did I get charged for this?" That's a good thing, and they both did that.

Because of HealthEdge, we're closing in those gaps. We're covering off of before it even gets to Joe. Joe gets the bill at his home or online, our teams and everything else. Overseeing with this digital, it goes back to the doctor, "Hey, you overcharged, you didn't do this or you shouldn't prescribe this. We're taking it off the bill." They're covering off on the things, the mischarge, everything else that used to take us weeks. Now, this stuff is days are corrected before it even gets to the member if they're responsible for anything.

The stuff I've had to rip out, the EHRs, you've heard, nightmare, everything else. There's a lot of homegrown stuff too. Michigan had its own homegrown EHR which is amazing. Payers built their own stuff. It's unfortunate because there was some really great work done but it wasn't going to match the things that we needed to become more, cloud-based, near-time digitally.

That's where a lot of stuff had to be replaced. It's not just the CAP system, it was everything. If you think about it, on average, today, most payers went from five to seven databases of its members to one data lake. That was a feat and it's been documented. We've used IBM and a few others, but that was like a two-year project to get four million members into one data lake. Good luck. Everywhere, everything matched up.

I think there was some big work and it's so much easier now. We've learned a ton. I think just because they are cloud does not mean everything. There are a lot of rules and a lot of pieces that sit with HealthEdge that I think they are ahead of the curve of, between their decisioning of their engines, clinical or otherwise., and then of course, the claims of unification that they've really become to known.

To be clear, we bolt on other pieces. There are things that HealthEdge doesn't do well. They don't do well in member engagement. I don't buy that. I just want their core CAP system. I've got other payers, so I can be selective. I don't know how well you know HealthEdge or not, but there's pieces of the puzzle if you go to their site.

**Client**
I definitely want to get your take on the other like the Burgess business, the Wellframe and member engagement business, all the other stuff they are doing. I definitely want to talk about that, so let's save some time at the end. You alluded to how arduous it is to rip out an old system.

My understanding is that the big national plans and some of the larger Blues, their Facets installation, or their homegrown stuff, they are just very resistant to converting that to a modern system. Is that the case? If it is, are they going to be forced at some point to do these huge, cumbersome, difficult migrations and to the benefit of a HealthEdge or not?

**Expert**
If you look at where we came from, and I can talk now. This stuff was easy. This stuff was hard. Let me just put an asterisk on all this stuff. Is this going into the cloud? It was so hard and no one ever talks about this. The cloud of our membership has to match where the claims are coming. It is like apples and oranges. I need to know when Joe's claim comes in that matches where Joe is in the cloud. You can't do that without the data. It sounds trivial. That was a huge job.

We already talked about the data lake, but no one ever talks about just clouds in general. They are great. Everything is SaaS, API-driven today, and it wasn't. That was a challenge because we had to get past compliance and everything else when we were first building it. If you look at where we came from and I talked about this at Health this year and I laugh and everybody thinks, "Oh, you are a miracle worker, you have a cloud." I said, "I bought an empty car."

I said, "No one ever talks about the work." While the cloud was being built on site, I had a luxury, I went with Salesforce Health Cloud. It was great. All been documented, it's all public. I had to go to work for six months. No one ever talks about or the claims would work. We had to build out every journey of clinical. There was a journey for diabetes and a journey for MSK and a journey for liver and any kind of disease, lethal or other allergies, you name it.

I had to pull together doctors and nurse practitioners, every clinical person you can imagine. We sat in a room for a week and every week we would pick off a new clinical diagnosis and go through all the if-then statements before we turn it over to the smarter engineers to code that, put it up in the cloud. That's why I can talk authentically. I can get clinical a lot of respects, but that work had to be done, still does, depending on who you are.

Once that sits in the cloud, these journeys is what makes all of things tick. Whether you are a hospital system, get diagnosed and care. The claim system of HealthEdge matches that so much better because they are more nimble and the more near-time they can accept things and they can bounce things off.

Unfortunately, Facets with its old claim system, there were so many workarounds. That's what we started with. It was a nightmare. It was hard. It was like taking a Model T and putting it into a Honda, not a Mercedes. We had to go through a lot, but things are so much more efficient.

If you understand how the architecture had to be put in place so we could get to this near-time world today, the softwares that now it's like no big deal. Everybody SaaS-based API. It's only been since 2019, hasn't been that long. I really prefer HealthEdge more today. TriZetto is no joke. They are owned by Cognizant. They are building their own cloud right now. I think the cumbersome piece that you touched on still lies in the legacy of Facets.

---

If I said it Cognizant and I got a room at a table and they got to say I said I wish they would go in and fix the initial claim adjudication system, everything else because I think that's a piece that's missing. Just my opinion that HealthEdge has done a better job at. I's not just better software. It's still the data. That's where I think the systems today whether you're Michigan Blue, Arkansas, whether you're Florida Blue, HCA.

We live and breathe off a diagnosis. That's when the game starts. Doesn't matter who you are, payer, hospital, whatever. We need a cloud-based system that is in the near-time atmosphere which you're going to add in AI down the road which I hope will speed things up. That's why I think the original architecture of where HealthEdge came to market when I first was introduced to them in 2013, I admire them. They're not perfect either. I spent a lot of money. I know we will get to that. I will pause for a second, but that's the guts of where I am seeing things.

**Client**
When you say that clinical journey piece, that if-then statement piece, is that a plan design element that HealthEdge is better at or is it something else?

**Expert**
I think you're right. It needs to match. I was a pioneer. I felt like this. I didn't invent. I had really smart people around me. I'm the poor guy that wrote the business case saying, "I wish we could do this stuff," and that's when we got them at the table. I have the advantage of being at the table when this stuff was being built. I think that helped learned knowledge.

When I talked to most folks, because everyone talks about onboarding when you buy a system, why is HealthEdge loved? They're just more adaptable to the many things that go on because no payer is alike. It doesn't matter how big they are, but they all have consistent areas. You still have claim. You still have things. You still got people, consumers.

I just think HealthEdge has been adaptable over time and keeps things up. I I think it's going to be a race. Again, I'm not here to throw TriZetto under the bus. They will catch up. They're throwing a lot of money at it. I just think that today for the architecture they had, they've evolved. It's going to be a race, but I think HealthEdge is really out far in the lead. They're going to stay out there because the teams and the people they have there and their leadership understand where we need to head.

In this newer world of digital, I'd love to say AI is going to save the world. That's another conversation for this. I don't believe in it yet. I like it. Don't worry. We've played on ChatGPT, but I don't think that's it because we still are dealing with human beings. The human factors, the other side of HealthEdge, I think they understand the human factor because when I brought them to the table, everything else, I was mandated.

When I walked in the door at Blue Cross, I had three things I had to cover off on. One, take us to the digital for Dan. I need to get it so I can see how healthy we are as an organization, which they couldn't do. It was every other week as a batch in Excel of membership that had become digitized.

Two, I need to solve for the top chronic diseases that are killing everybody, literally, not dying. Diabetes is still number one. It was number one when I walked through the door. How do we get our hands right? I want to know when Joe gets diagnosed. You need to help Joe. If Joe is still sick as a payer, that's one, I'm not helping him. If I don't help him, there goes my ROI. He'll end up in urgent care. That's two.

Three, how are we going to help our network of physicians and doctors? If we're processing and reimbursing claims and scheduling all that kind of stuff, how do I help that if I'm not digital? Those three areas is what I dumped on HealthEdge. I just didn't buy another cloud. It's just a platform.

**Client**
Getting back to this topic of the Uniteds and the Anthems and the Signas that are either on Facets or have a homegrown system or some version of both, depending on the business line, are those going to turn into conversions? Is that addressable for HealthEdge, or are those big payers just too dug in on what they've already got? One thing that I've heard, similar to the point you were making. These migrations are so difficult, so expensive, and take so many years that no one wants to do them. Even if there's some ROI there, it just takes too long to realize it.

**Expert**
Honestly, I think a lot of that gets in the marketplace because then they can charge more because they think of how hard it's going to be. We don't just want to throw money at a lot of this. I agree partly of it. I had great people at the table with great companies and smarter than me, and I felt I pulled the best companies together, saying I want to get to here and I push them. I've repeated that now dozens of times at different groups.

Let's just go to the facts. This stuff's expensive, but the converse of it, if you're not more digitized and you aren't moving things faster, the game is pretty simple. It's a diagnosis, a claim, and a care. We haven't tackled the biggest piece in the U.S. right now, which there is no care coordination, nor is there care navigation we know more. HealthEdge helps that, so does TriZetto.

To your point, yes, it costs millions of dollars to implement these. Let's go backwards. You can stand up a TriZetto platform in about nine months and they'll pilot, you never just turn on the whole switch. HealthEdge has been quicker in my experience from small, medium, and large. We've stood up HealthEdge pieces of it in six to seven months, then we go testing. It takes longer.

You're really operational I'd say with TriZetto, about a year and a half, after spending probably about, $5 million-$10 million more than HealthEdge. HealthEdge stands up quicker but the piece that you don't get as well, you got a bolt on for instance is I've had to bring on Zelis as payment integrity. I think they're the best at what they do into the HealthEdge piece where before I can't remember the name of the company does TriZetto's payment integrity. They've got a built-in source.

My brain hurts a lot of this stuff. It's cumbersome, it's hard to do. There's only one thing harder in EHR. Good luck. If you swap out Cerner Oracle for Epic, they're the two biggest cash slots and timing. Be careful what you wish for. I agree, but I also think things are picking up speed. We're getting better at this game. I expect in the next two to three years that this cloud-based and with AI coming and everything else, I think that monies and costs will go down because integrations will be easier, to be honest.

That's just my opinion for the teams we had on board. Knowing what I know today, I wouldn't have had to pull in two of the big five to implement. I don't know what I had to do back then. You can't imagine the number of hands I had on deck to get the stuff built. Salesforce doesn't build anything on site. They did for this because it didn't exist yet. I'm not that special but we are a guinea pig.

Monies being what they are and everything else, I think there's an efficiency. You read about the interoperability and what CMS is doing regardless of what's going on in the government, the word isn't easier, I think there'll be an efficiency because I think we're getting better and standardized within the claim system and everything else. The albatross, this whole thing is, on the right-hand side when I put on the enterprise, is all the doctors. It's not their fault but every doctor out there has a different, damn EMR which causes us headaches.

There isn't one substantial EMR because doctors, physician groups, whatever, the EMR when the claim comes in, if it's a different claim, we haven't accepted it, that takes time right to reprocess claims and accept it. I'll pause for a second but no, I expect in the next two to three years. I love when people ask me, "Well, will you rip out HealthEdge and put in TriZetto?" No, there's no more ripping. There's adjusting. We do pieces, but I think the days of rip and replace are going to be gone. I think things are going to be better.

It's an investment, to be honest, in these claim systems because we can't live without it. I think technology is catching up. The right technology. We've learned a lot in these last four, five years. I think it's interesting. I do a lot of calls around this. As you can hear from my voice, I have lived this. We still haven't solved really for the care nav and the care coordination piece of it yet. We are working on that right now for all patients. I don't care what you have. It can be some simple. You could have allergies.

**Client**
That's interesting. It takes me to my next point, which is the other solutions that HealthEdge is trying to integrate. GuidingCare, which is their care coordination, and Wellframe, the patient engagement piece, is one of them. Maybe we could just take them one at a time. What's your assessment of Source? It sounds like you're saying Zelis is better. Can you expand on that?

**Expert**
Zelis came through the door. I've worked with them since 2014. I've gotten to know the CEO. I can't remember. It's rare when you get a CEO that embraces. They don't just run the company. They get it, they understand it. It's such a critical piece. When I walked in the door another gap was quick. We were quick to put people into billing issues, consumers and non-payment claims that put you into debt. It wasn't the intention, but we weren't digital. We thought we were digital.

Zelis came and fit such a critical need that everybody won. Source, I don't know what they're going to be when they grow up, to be honest. I haven't been impressed with their interface. It's harder to integrate. You can buy everything from HealthEdge. It's not just one platform. I don't prefer them. How do you not throw them under the bus? I think their leadership lags, to be honest with you. The team that's down there, I think.

If I didn't have Zelis, I would go to Cotiviti before I'd go to Source if that's all I had left because I just think they're that much better. I don't like the way Source integrates. I don't like what they've done. Even Pega, for what they've been doing has offered better solutions on the integrity piece of it. Pega's got its own issues. I think Source is still catching up. I do. They're not a bad company by any means. I admire HealthEdge because of their partnerships they bring in, but that one, I don't think gets them to the head of the table. That's just my opinion. I don't prefer them.

Like I told you initially, of the few payers I've used, Zelis has been an automatic partner. I trust the leadership. I love what they do. I love how they keep things up. I don't have stock in them. I just think they get the core competency of what payment integrity is needed, what the constant updating of providing a better solution that helps us get the cost savings down, improve why we do this, the patient outcomes, and the operational efficiency. That's what we do for a living with those systems. That's what that does. I've been part of big companies just to acquire someone or put them in there just to have a checkbox. I I think that's all it is.

**Client**
Interesting. How well integrated is Source in the HRP CAPS? Is there any advantage to having both CAPS and payment integrity from one provider? It feels to me those are pretty integrated workflows, but not having sat in one of these payers, I just don't know.

It would be a slam dunk if it was integrated. It would be so nice not to think about it because then from the claims coming in and the many touchpad handoffs, it has to go through. It's a no-brainer. It would save the payer a ton of money of not having to build something else out. I think it's also from a business standpoint. The problem is not Source. The problem is your core competency.

HealthEdge and TriZetto are CAP systems. That's what they do for a living. I get that they're trying to add on and get more components and about the only other piece if it was purely greatly integrated and really worked operationally well would be the payment integrity piece. I know we're going to talk about Wellframe, a few others but if those two boxes were checked, it makes the payer world easier. Makes my life easier. It's a two for one. I haven't seen it yet and I haven't really done it because I don't prefer Source. I've had to bolt on Zelis. Zelis comes in a little bit easier than most. Cotiviti comes in too. Bottom line, Source doesn't integrate well. It doesn't.

**Client**
They haven't combined well.

**Expert**
I don't think it would ever be turnkey and it's not plug and play. I wish they'd be more like Salesforce in a sense of systems. I talked about this at Health and they said, "Guys should get stuck in Salesforce. I've known these guys for 20 years." Salesforce has always figured out how to integrate whether it's Sales Cloud and Marketing Cloud and Health Cloud. Their systems integrate.

Healthcare needs that and here I just took one of their big pieces which was Health Cloud. I've used marketing sales at other companies for years. If healthcare is really going to start singing along and doing well, it'd be great not to spend money and budget on integration if I didn't have to spend it. If you think about it, if I buy a system and I got to spend the integration then something else can't come in this year especially these are big expenditures.

These aren't one-year contracts. These are five-year deals and it takes a year and a half. It's almost two years before we even see it really rolling. I just think if those two pieces were further integrated and I'm surprised just my opinion. I can't believe that Zelis is still on its own. Really just impressed that they haven't been picked up. Who knows. That's not my role but it would be a dream, because I have enough headaches as it is to go through gaps in care and everything else. This is such a big piece of it and the only benefit is that the EHR sits within that world. I'm a three-for-one.

All I have to worry about then is constantly updating, make sure the data lake's fine and operational. Clouds are easier to maintain once they're built because they're operational because of the claims filling it which are the members coming through it whether you have two million members, four million, three million doesn't matter. That's what I've seen. I would hope, as I live in this headache-ridden healthcare environment that I try to make better.

**Client**
Let me ask you about the care coordination stuff that HealthEdge owns. GuidingCare and Wellframe. What's your sense of whether those are good modules, whether the CAP software vendor is the natural winner in that space? What's your assessment of those products?

**Expert**
I was working with Wellframe. I'd look at it. When did I sign the deal? We brought Wellframe in way before we were doing a lot of stuff. I've known those guys before they were brought into HealthEdge full time. I've known them. Honestly, they're not the same company. I like them better when they weren't part of HealthEdge. I think they're different. They were unique when I first met them. I love the team.

GuidingCare and Wellframe, two different kinds of care management. If you're looking high level, GuidingCare is way better on the coordination of care, period. They manage the patient journeys I had to build from the diagnosis to treatment better than most. Wellframe, who started out on that path, they've always been a mobile first. They always taught that and I came from the mobile world so I always laugh at that.

They've always talked highbrow with patient engagement and personalized care management and chronic condition. I really think what their strength has always been which I brought them initially was remote patient monitoring. They helped the remote part of it that we didn't have because we're on a path to get value-based care. Wellframe, I'd have to look up the stats. We brought them in I can't remember I think it was like 2014. I've known these guys for a while and I can't remember when they became a part of HealthEdge.

GuidingCare always targeted the care managers and the pop health orgs with health plans versus Wellframe right after the payers. They were very payer-centric, all coming with patient engagement. That's what's always their shtick and that's not a bad thing. They're two different kinds of companies. Platform wise, I think GuidingCare, interesting now, look back but, they were always stronger on the integration with health plans for the care team with all the care transitions versus Wellframe that they were better at the communications.

There's a word in between these two utilization. It's our biggest gap in the payer world. We are horrible at it. We don't communicate. We don't tell you when we have a Livongo or Omada if you get Type two diabetes and we have Livongo reach out, you call the call center at the payer saying, "Hey who's this Livongo? No one told me about it." I give credit Wellframe they are better to coordinate and communicate to the membership and I don't mean a marketing weekly meeting or newsletter.

---

They've always helped us communicate more efficiently to the right message at the right time, to the right member depending on the care needed. They're two different kinds of companies. They've both kept up on the AI side. The other thing too is that Wellframe I always love because it matched up easily with our risk platform down that Change Healthcare was riding with.

Wellframe was better than what GuidingCare was doing. They were better on the analytics and they identified higher risk patients with interventions based upon the data that they're getting from the data lake that would funnel back and they'd compare off Change Healthcare. It allowed us to manage you better. That was another key feature that I was buying way back then in 2015, 2016.

They are both very customizable, they are both good that way. Honestly, I have felt that Wellframe has crept back. I don't think they've stayed as forward-thinking as they once were in leadership. I think leadership has changed now since becoming part of HealthEdge. Not a bad company at all. GuidingCare, I think has kept up. If anything, I would blend the two of them together.

I think they have a left and right hand and if they were together more integrated, call it blue company, I think it would be better because again, you are getting my passion play here today. I get really irritated because we are so much better than we were, but we cannot tackle care coordination from a patient advocacy standpoint. One of these two or both these to come together because I think they do stick out in the marketplace. Both of them better than most. We don't use them exactly because we don't have the pizza. I got to make them better through other companies and it cost me money.

**Client**
How much overlap and functionality is there? Aside from the fact that Wellframe is more of a communication platform, it seems like they're trying to solve the same problem which is helping payers get to the member before they need to get into the emergency room, es

**Expert**
That was always their premise and why we signed the deal and they still haven't gotten it or I wouldn't be talking about why care coordination and care navigation is broken. Honestly, I thought they'd solve it. That's why I signed the deal. I I really thought way ahead of time. Now, here we sit today, I know more about you, I know more about your gap, I know your treatment, everything else, but you still don't know enough. I say this a lot, it's not new news.

In this world of health and tech and IT and all this stuff, there is nobody today, I don't care payer, provider, health plan that's advocating for that patient. It's this simple. Think about it. You and I both go to the doctor, we get diagnosed and we're sitting in the doctor's office.

This is relevant before these two start their jobs. You and I both get diagnosed, we're sitting on the paper, doctor comes in, say we both have Type two diabetes, get prescribed, get the treatment. We walk out, do the human thing. You think you're going to die. Not the case. You go to Google which we don't want you to do. Where' are you supposed to go? Where am I supposed to go? You go to Walgreens, you find out your medicine's too expensive, you call the payer, "Hey, why aren't you copaying this?" It's really expensive. You call the doctor, they prescribe something else.

I truly feel that for all the gaps and all the care and everything else we know today, nobody's helping and it's no one's fault. It's the way the system's been designed. My point is care coordination and care navigation will only get better if we solve and work our way inside out. I think it's problem that came because of all the tech. We never could have conversations about the patients but that's another day.

GuidingCare and Wellframe should be helping this, especially Wellframe, you're supposed to be coordinating, talking to him before he calls the payer and rips the call center apart. I didn't get the carry. Right now, most consumers hate their payers, don't want to go in the portals. There aren't two other companies. It's not Optum, it's not Change, it's not any of these big guys. It's not Teladoc, it's not Amwell going to solve this.

Those two need to come together and it's really not HealthEdge's core competency of CAPS. It's a thing, it's a bolt on. It's really good. They're forward thinking. I don't know if I'm answering your questions. They're two different companies. I've always summed it up. GuidingCare equals POP health management and care coordination, period.

Wellframe, patient centered mobile first communicator direct to our gauge to our patients. Two different companies. Maybe you're making me think here. Maybe I need to go get a bag of money and combine them. Take them out and go figure out why this is broken. That's just my 10 cents. They both have such key assets and smart. They're both great. Which is ironic. The irony of this, why aren't they together? They're sitting with HealthEdge for God's sakes. Did I answer your questions?

**Client**
That answers my question. Who's doing it better than either GuidingCare or Wellframe, maybe more GuidingCare than Wellframe because it sounds like Wellframe's not doing it particularly well, but GuidingCare. Is there someone doing it better or are they doing a good job?

**Expert**
They're doing an okay job. We're doing our own thing better. Honestly, answer is no. There is no go to, what I talk to. I'm doing it better. How's that? I'm pulling. I'm making other companies help me coordinate this care. It's actually a topic conversation. This is our goal for this year. Outside of efficiency and the typical payer stuff because we coordinate everything. My goal this year is to get him out of limbo, meaning a diagnosis of anything. Doesn't have to be lethal.

How do we solve for people? How do we work our way back in? The path of this care today is it's rinse and repeat. Doctors diagnose us, he or she did their job. That's what they're supposed to do, not follow up, they'll recommend specialists. The minute they do that, then the onus is on him. We've never been taught through this system where to go as a consumer and we really don't want people Googling or going to WebMD.

I don't want you going to Google, but where should you go? Is it Wellframe? They can send me communication but I still don't trust. There's a missing piece which I spoke about the other night is who is the patient supposed to trust? Is it Wellframe? Is it GuidingCare? Most times they're white labeled. It's still underneath the hood of Blue Cross. We will white label. I really think from what I've done here, I'm leveraging partnerships that I've had with the Amwells not because of telehealth, but the Amwells.

I'm working with Optum saying, "How the hell do we solve this?" I've talked with Mayo and Cleveland Clinic to back this in. How do we match today's diagnosis from the doctor to get people the information and they care they needs and help them navigate that journey that doesn't know they're on? Prescriptions are great, and everybody laughed at me, but I said, "Well, none of us read anything."

We walk out of doctor's offices. Does anybody read? Nope. We're digital and we can spin up another mobile app. Wouldn't it be great if we had a guide? The doctor goes, "Hey, you're not going to listen to me today. You're going to do the human thing. You're worried." Here are these three stakeholders that you need to understand for your treatment. Here's where you need to go. Don't go here. We don't have that yet. It's no one's fault. I think it's an evolution kind of thing too. It's no one's fault.

I'm not blaming Wellframe or GuidingCare. I think they're great companies, so don't get me wrong, if I came across that way, I just wish they did more. I think we're catching up and AI is not going to be the solve. I'm sorry because there's still humans that have to program them. We'll keep going through this. I'm mindful of your time. What are you hoping to derive? Is it X versus O? Which one's better? Is this a report you're trying to establish? I get to talk a lot of venture people and everything else. What's your outcome? What are you trying to derive so I can best help?

**Client**
I'm just trying to understand the competitive landscape of this CAPS and adjacent to CAPS software end markets and who the winners are likely to be and the pace at which that market share is likely to shift if it's going to. I was asking in the beginning, I've heard from some of your peers that HealthEdge is actually truly the strongest next-gen platform.

The governor on their ability to take share is just that these conversions are really cumbersome and payers try not to do them unless they absolutely have to. What I'm wondering is are they going to have to or can we sit on the current installed base for another decade and can this sit outside the cloud for longer than it feels like every other industry has?

**Expert**
We can't because we'll get behind things, the expectations. Things are moving faster, which is a good thing. I disagree with my colleagues that do interoperability, everything else, and data. Our data is better than we've had in 10 years. It's only going to get better because things have sped up, because systems are better than they were. Yes, they're always going to be better and we're always going to have duplicate claims and we're going to have outlier claim to tech, all these kinds of things. I get it.

We've come a long way in a short amount of time and we're better than we were. We're still learning a lot of this stuff, for all the damn algorithms and everything else in the codes, you hear about this every day, the gaps in journeys. It's not because we wanted them. We're evolving, we're learning it. I think AI will help some details. I still really feel personally that we're in a near-time world. We're not real-time for claims validation yet not because of us, but because everything feeding us, that's number one.

We have such an issue with being able to prepay, the whole editing function has so many errors that affect reimbursement. That's still a problem. Seems like that should have been done, God, 10 years ago. I hate the word optimization, but our claims are better than they were and our analytics are great. The workflows through revenue claim cycles are better and I think our times are down, but the speed's picking up.

We're there to accept the speed. I don't care about people talking about end-to-end solutions. They never worked because I don't even think I know what the other end is. I don't want to end. Healthcare is not done. It's end to wherever is where I've said it. I feel like I should write a book. I don't have time. No one's paying me for it.

If you're looking further down the road, we're all used to mobile apps. We're all better digital payment platforms. Look at what we're also better at. Things are more compliant than they ever have been and that's a good thing. Everybody wants to throw the government under the bus. I don't care who's in office. CMS has done a hell of a job on the one side of our compliance and everything else is better. Everybody wins, the patient, the payer, the hospital. That's a good thing. HealthEdge and TriZetto have helped that from a process standpoint.

You're asking where are we going to be in three or four years? Who are the real losers? The legacy system's got to go away. If they weren't going away, then you wouldn't have Larry Ellison be moving and uprooting his company. Moving to Nashville, the home of healthcare. I really admire that man. Some days I think he's Billy. You just don't move Oracle and I think he's automated. They don't have the answers.

I think that's good. Not because they're physically moving, but because they're trying to march to a different level and leverage AI and all this other stuff. The problem is in some cases, we still have slow claims processing coming from the doctors, need a greater EMR system. We have some payers that have limited scalability. They don't have the budgets that some of the bigger guys have. They're not swimming in money. That's a problem. You couldn't accept a HealthEdge. They can't afford it. You only get pieces of it.

The HealthEdges and the TriZettos, if they're listening, I hope they don't limit their focus on the automation that they do invest more in automating the things we can automate, increasing the speed and then work on the things that need to be worked on, not fixed. Any long processing cycle costs everybody money. Payers pass on costs. They love to pass on costs. I don't know about you, but my health plan has never gone down ever. It's not about reimbursement.

The hope here is everyone's got weaknesses. I really feel that our speed's going to pick up. That's a good thing. I think we're better than we were. Clouds came in, which I think is a great thing. I just expect you were going to talk about it. The piece that we really need to address. The difference where I'm going to be choosing between these two is who's going to do anything around the patient, whether you're calling it member engagement, patient engagement, patient advocacy, because that's the gap.

How do you solve for Joe? I put that top of your paper. How do you solve for Derek and his family? Who does it better? If you work your way inside out, then I would easily write a check for a system that I can see more in near time, more in real time. If I help Joe get into care and keep him there and he at least maintains, a lot of times you won't get cured.

That's the system I want and today, I'm still betting on HealthEdge. I think they're more embracing, not technology, but timing, speed, innovation. I'm just waiting for Cognizant to keep writing the big checks. I know they're working on stuff. They will be in the cloud, I think, by the end of 2025, greater than they are now, but I don't know. Does that make sense? I don't know. I bounce off you. You've been talking to a lot of other folks. Hopefully, I'm not off the transom too far.

Well, thank you again for taking the time to speak with us today. This was very helpful. Enjoy the rest of your day.
