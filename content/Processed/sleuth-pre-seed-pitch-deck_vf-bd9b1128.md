## Slide 3: Data analysis in biotech isn't what it should be

# Data analysis in biotech isn't what it should be

It's 2023, yet analysts still:

*   (Icon: Data cylinder with cross out) Miss data
*   (Icon: Curate) Manually curate
*   (Icon: Excel X) Manually analyze
*   (Icon: Brain/Head) Exclusively use human judgement
*   (Icon: Warning triangle) Iteratively adjust inputs

## Slide 6: We see biotech through numbers, not lab coats

# We see biotech through numbers, not lab coats

Modeling biology is HARD; here's how investors do it:

*   (Red X) Over-index on “experts”
*   (Red X) Manually quantify scientific nuances
*   (Red X) Neglect broader data trends

(Images A, B, C showing molecular structures and receptor binding sites, with labels like "Extracellular allosteric site", "Sodium ion binding site", "Intracellular allosteric site", "Bitopic ligand", "primary pharmacophore (PP)", "secondary pharmacophore (SP)", "linker", "secondary binding pocket (SBP)", "ortosteric binding pocket (OBP)", "Receptor".)

And here's Sleuth's unique approach to crack biotech:

*   (Icon: Data Science) Data science-based
*   (Icon: Laptop with person) Analyst co-pilot (not a black box)
*   (Icon: Workflow/Process) Purpose-built for investors' workflow

## Slide 7: First, build tools to uncover alpha with leading investors Then, capitalize on alpha directly

# First, build tools to uncover alpha with leading investors
Then, capitalize on alpha directly

$10B+ up for grabs

1.  Establish wedge market (biotech investors) via land & expand
2.  Expand within funds to similar ICP in other healthcare verticals
3.  Win upmarket (corporates) with broader product suite
4.  (Co)-Invest directly through our own fund

## Slide 10: Unique product + proven value = evergreen opportunity

# Unique product + proven value = evergreen opportunity

Evergreen opportunity = new budget is created, rather than further division of existing spend

(Flowchart with icons)

*   (Icon: Bag of money) Funds spend $$$ on databases or general tools(1)
*   (Arrow)
*   (Icon: Gears with money) Sleuth has a much higher ROI than a general tool(2)
*   (Arrow)
*   (Icon: Calculator with money) Funds allocate new budget rather than divide existing

(1) Per Sleuth customer discovery calls, avg. fund spends six-figures to millions on software & data
(2) Sleuth plugs into the analyst' workflow and delivers better insights faster - this leads to better investments; given the scale of deployment for these funds (i.e. millions into each opportunity), then even a small % improvement will payback a low six-figures product multiple times over

(1) Automating access to the datasets analysts manually create in Excel, such as a cross-trial analysis along 40+ metrics
(2) Perceived unfavorably by analysts as a low-trust black box with complex UI; primarily target pharma trial design teams
(3) Backed out LS division based on organic revenue contribution

## Slide 14: We generate probability distributions that guide decision making through a semi-automated, patent-pending approach

# We generate probability distributions that guide decision making through a semi-automated, patent-pending approach

### Standard Approach

*   Call KOLs / management / sell-side
    *   Same insights as others
*   "Deep science" analysis
    *   Too complicated to model effectively
*   Limited Excel-based data analysis
*   Best guess

### Sleuth Approach (1)

*   Identify similar trials
    *   Patent-pending algorithm
    *   (Arrow back to Build model)
*   Extract data from multiple sources
    *   Trials, papers, registries, corporate docs
*   Build model for projected trial
    *   User-adjustable sliders to further optimize
    *   (Arrow back to Identify similar trials)
*   Algorithm improvement for next iteration
*   Iterate as needed
*   Generate probability distribution over potential outcomes
    *   Visualize in seconds

(1) Illustrated for clinical trial analysis, but this framework can be deployed across workflow (i.e. for assessing commercial pull-through)

## Slide 15: Learnings from 80+ customer discovery calls reflect immense need + demand for Sleuth

# Learnings from 80+ customer discovery calls reflect immense need + demand for Sleuth

*   Investors resonate with a user-adjustable simulation tool that presents a distribution of potential outcomes - they want to try it right away
    *   Analysts & PMs are skeptical - this cannot be a black box prediction tool
    *   They want better tools, but the tools need to fit in their unique workflow
*   Existing databases / tools are not viewed favorably (lots of manual adjustment required to get desired output, poor UX, missing data, low trust etc.)
*   Funds have the budget and willingness to pay >$100K for tools that reduce time-to-insight while increasing the quality of insights
*   Biotech analysts spend >50% of their time analyzing and projecting clinical trial readouts and the balance on analyzing and projecting commercial performance
*   Manually aggregating and analyzing data for cross trial analyses is a huge pain point
*   Time-to-insight for expert networks is unreliable / slow - they'd rather iterate themselves
*   Projecting performance of subgroups in trials is critical
*   Analysts track the impact of adjusting multiple inputs entirely in their head (and many had stories of how this lost them money)
