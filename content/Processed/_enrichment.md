Generated: 2026-01-07

## Summary
Project Horizon (analyzed by Westcove Partners) is an AI-enabled research managed services organization that embeds within independent practices, PE-backed MSOs, and health systems to provide turnkey clinical trial capabilities. They serve 4.65M+ patients across 380+ practitioners in 7 states, targeting ~$8M revenue in 2025 with ~45% CAGR since 2020.

## Similar Deals/Sources
- **No similar deals found in vault**: This appears to be the first clinical trial services platform in our pipeline focused on AI patient-trial matching and EHR integration.

## Thesis Matches

### Biotech Operations Intelligence Captures Trial Ops—Point Solutions Become Platforms
**Fit:** Project Horizon directly fits this thesis mechanism: '5,950 of 6,000 pharma companies run trials on Excel spreadsheets. 94% of trials are delayed >1 month, costing $600K-$8M/day.' Their AI patient-trial matching and EHR-integrated software targets the exact problem of trial delays and manual processes. The thesis states 'Point solutions that start with one wedge (supply forecasting, CDMO selection, trial accruals, patient payments) expand into integrated ops platforms.'
**Concerns:** The thesis notes 'clinical research services market is fragmented with high customer acquisition costs, unpredictable study volume, and dependency on sponsor budgets outside their control.' At ~$8M revenue, Project Horizon may still be vulnerable to these structural challenges before achieving platform scale.

### Clinical Outcome Data Is the Moat, Not Wet Lab
**Fit:** Project Horizon's approach aligns with the thesis that 'clinical outcome data becomes the ultimate defensible asset' by aggregating real-world evidence through their provider network. Their 4.65M+ patient population and multi-site research platform could generate the proprietary clinical data that creates competitive moats.
**Concerns:** The thesis emphasizes that 'wet lab data creates moats (for now)' but clinical outcome data is the ultimate prize. Project Horizon may be in the middle layer without owning either wet lab generation or population-scale clinical outcomes validation.

## Diligence Questions

1. **[Product/Tech]** Can you walk through your AI patient-trial matching algorithm specifically? What accuracy rates do you achieve vs manual matching, and how does this translate to faster enrollment timelines?
   - *Why:* Tests the core value prop against the thesis claim that AI automation can address the '94% of trials delayed >1 month' problem.

2. **[Commercial]** What is your specific ROI calculation for pharma sponsors? Can you break down cost savings per enrolled patient vs traditional site identification and management?
   - *Why:* The thesis notes 'trial delays cost $600K-$8M/day' - need to verify Project Horizon captures meaningful portion of these savings.

3. **[Product/Tech]** How do you handle the 'unpredictable study volume and dependency on sponsor budgets' challenge that affects most CRO/research services companies?
   - *Why:* Directly addresses the thesis bear case about structural challenges in clinical research services.

4. **[Commercial]** What does your expansion roadmap look like from research coordination into other trial ops functions (supply chain, regulatory, data management)?
   - *Why:* Tests whether they can become the 'integrated ops platform' the thesis predicts will emerge, rather than remaining a point solution.

5. **[Product/Tech]** What proprietary clinical outcome data are you generating that competitors can't replicate? How does your 4.65M patient dataset create differentiation?
   - *Why:* Probes the 'Clinical Outcome Data Is the Moat' thesis - whether they're building defensible data assets or just processing services.

6. **[Commercial]** How do customer acquisition costs and sales cycles compare to traditional CROs? What's your path to the ~$70M medium-term revenue projection?
   - *Why:* The Affinity notes show skepticism about reaching $70M revenue - need to understand unit economics and scalability.

## Market Context
Web search reveals Westcove Partners is a healthcare-focused investment bank, not a VC fund as initially suggested. This appears to be deal sourcing/advisory rather than direct investment. The clinical trial services market timing aligns with our thesis on trial operations automation becoming critical.
