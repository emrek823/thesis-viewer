### Scheduling and Logistics

- Meeting rescheduled to 5pm Central (3 hours from original time)
	- Bobby held up in transit after 2 weeks of travel
	- Tomorrow’s family commitment prevented evening alternative
- Draft memo already sent to Bobby for review ahead of meeting

### Fund Performance and Portfolio Updates

- Q3 2025 marks: 1.7x TVPI, 29% net IRR (34-35% gross)
	- Recent markdowns: Hero Journey written to zero (proactive decision)
	- Q4 expected markdowns across portfolio for conservative approach
- Recent funding rounds completed:
	- Anna Health: $17.5M Series A term sheet (not yet wired)
	- Translucent: Series A at 4-4.5x seed valuation
	- Prudentia: Series A at 3.5-4x seed valuation
	- Hermes: $4M seed at $18M post (from $5M post initial)
- Pipeline developments:
	- Solstice: Most asked-about company, expecting $12-15M Series A
	- Standard Model Bio: Series A in Q1, potentially $20-50M round
	- Integral: Series B expected before year-end

### Fund II Strategy and Check Sizing

- Current fund size constraints creating competitive challenges
	- $50-55M fund difficult to execute in today’s seed market
	- Leading 75% of deals but constrained by check size limitations
- Target ownership evolution:
	- Moving from 10% to 15% initial ownership
	- Strategy: aggressive upfront capital deployment vs. waiting for Series A
	- Example: Anna Health - 12% at pre-seed, doubled down to 22-23% total ownership
- Check size increase rationale:

### Healthcare Sector Positioning

- Strategic rotation away from care delivery (started 2.5 years ago)
	- Series A/B market sentiment extremely tough for care delivery
	- Oak HC/FT and Transformation Capital reducing care delivery focus
- Portfolio concentration in pharma tech and AI-enabled healthcare
	- Differentiating factor vs. healthcare generalists
	- Anticipating where growth market will move next
- Competitive advantage in technical diligence
	- Founders increasingly seeking brand pedigree (Sequoia, a16z) over healthcare-specific VCs at Series A
	- Healthcare VCs lacking technical skills for AI-native companies

### Guide Investment Case Study

- $500K investment at $75M post (started at $30-35M, bidding war to $75M)
- Exception to typical strategy due to:
	- 5-year relationship with founder Will
	- Learning from two prior high-priced passes (now marked at $1B and $650M)
	- Series A at $250M - considering SPV participation but logistically challenging before Christmas
- Investment philosophy: aggressive early positions in quality companies vs. sourcing for others
