## Slide 4: Decline In Independent Physicians = Decline in Quality of Care
Quality of patient care is rapidly declining across the country, due to the decline in independent physicians who lack the business and technological infrastructure to sustainably run their practice and remain independent.

Financial pressures by profit-led organizations leads to over-treatment or under-treatment.
* Standardized care protocols does not always consider individual patient needs.
* Limited time for patient interaction hinders effective communication and shared decision-making.
* Pressure to adhere to reimbursement guidelines influences treatment and diagnostic accuracy.

## Slide 11: Approaching the Market From Both Sides
*   **Risk Bearing Entities**
    Through collaborations with risk-bearing entities, we form strong partnerships with health insurers, managed care organizations, and physicians' organizations. These partnerships enable us to provide seamless services to independent providers, enhancing their existing contracts and delivering added value to their customers.
*   **Independent Providers**
    By targeting billing companies, we integrate our services as a valuable addition to their existing offerings, thereby enhancing the services received by their customers. This approach also allows us to leverage their existing contracts, reducing our sales cycles and streamlining the onboarding process of our newly offered services.

## Slide 20: Driving Clinical Operations
### Driving Clinical Operations
## Jubilee

## Slide 21: Quality Measures (HEDIS) and Risk Adjustment (RA)
### Why It Matters
CMS' Quality Measures and Risk Adjustment incentives are the primary monetary drivers for value-based healthcare, rewarding physicians for improving care quality and adjusting payments based on health status and needs of individual patients. Success in these initiatives ensures financial stability for their organization.

## Slide 22: It's Hard for Physicians to Effectively Close Gaps Quality & Risk Adjust
In order to effectively close quality gaps and perform risk adjustment within a practice, physicians must take on significant operational burden using reimbursements from inconsistent payment cycles, including:
*   Managing patient gap lists across contracted health plans to perform certain types of visits (e.g. scheduling AWVs, referring to appropriate specialists, chasing charts from referrals).
*   Appropriately documenting visits for diagnosis and procedures & managing the claims submission process.
*   Reconciling irregular & obscure payments over long pay cycles (i.e. RA payments can take up to 18 months to get to the provider).

## Slide 23: Why We Are Working on Jubilee
### ApolloMed
The QCO department is essentially a VBC primary care clinic. Their QCO programs are divided into key Quality measures, each of which require significant operational burden to perform successfully. By working with this team, we get first-hand experience on what it takes for a practice to run a successful Quality operation. The RA department is responsible for ensuring their independent providers are submitting the right data and improving their RAF scores. Working with them allows us to understand what health plans and MSO/IPAs need from the provider. Though one degree removed, knowing the expectations of the provider's main stakeholders gives us context on what a successful RA practice operation needs to deliver.

### Clever Care Health Plan (CCHP)
Our proof of concept project with CCHP is another avenue through which we can learn, ideate, and test our hypotheses on what infrastructure we need to build for an independent physician to run a successful value-based practice. The primary goal is to validate a set of tech-enabled services by working directly with pilot providers. Achieving this goal will clarify our direct-to-provider value proposition and make way for a GTM strategy.

## Slide 24: Company Future-State
### 2023
Our 2023 goal is to define and operationalize a validated set of provider-focused tech-enabled services through these customers and projects. We are aiming to launch these services for at least 1-3 providers in Southern California.

### 2024
Our 2024 goal is to scale our services to more independent physician practices across Southern California, iterating on our technology and operations to achieve product-market fit. We are aiming to be able to scale these services for at least 3-10 providers in Southern California.
