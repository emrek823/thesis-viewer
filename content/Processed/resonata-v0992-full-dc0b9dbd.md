## Slide 6: Stakeholder value creation

**Stakeholder value creation**

**Offer sponsors**
*   **Commercial:** Precision DTC » Accelerated adoption during patent life; High ROI; Overcomes poor perception of DTC ads
*   **Clinical:** Rapid recruitment; Reduced trial participant turnover costs; Trial design & feasibility toolkit

*   The CRO is a year behind. At this point, only supernatural intervention will get the study moving.
*   The PI still hasn't called the patient who's been waiting two months. Enrollment out the window for the 8th time in a row. *Actual LinkedIn post, 9/3/25*

*(Diagram shows money flowing from Sponsors to Resonata, and from Resonata to Patient service providers and Enrollers.)*

**Offer enrollers**
*   Easier patient recruitment

*   Rapid onboarding with data transfers

**Patient service providers**
**(e.g. health apps)**
*   Adds value to patient services with personalized treatment and testing options
*   Revenue sharing from pool based on patient contribution: strong alignment of incentives

**Patients**
*   Access to relevant & better care options (not a random Facebook ad or google search)
*   No 'extra' place to go/ receive options where they are

## Slide 7: As experts in oncology trial matching, we saw a bigger pattern

**As experts in oncology trial matching, we saw a bigger pattern**

**Selection criteria complexity isn't unique to the pre-approval space**

*(Diagram illustrating flow from Clinical trial selection criteria to Prescribing information.)*

**Clinical trial selection criteria**
Sophisticated by nature
*Pre-approval*

**Eligibility parameters**
*   Previous treatments
*   Comorbidities
*   Biomarkers
*   Cross-reacting medicines
*   Lab values

*Post-approval*
**Prescribing information**
Inherited/ Increasing sophistication

**Example: (Inclusion) – "Patient must have received at least 2 lines of platinum doublet therapy in the advanced/metastatic setting, with progression occurring within 6 months of the last dose"**

**Apply clinical trial matching technology to all healthcare marketing**
*   Same methodologies/ know-how
*   All therapeutic areas
*   Adapted workflows
*   Distinct revenue models

**10-20x improvement in marketing efficiency**

## Slide 8: Category creation - Medical-Grade Information Targeting

**Category creation**
**Medical-Grade Information Targeting**

**The Dr. Google Problem**
*   Broad keyword & geographic matching
*   Patients leap to inaccurate conclusions
*   Doctors forced to dispel information that isn't relevant to begin with
*   Precision healthcare information delivery is impossible

**Resonata's Novel Solution**
*   Clinical reasoning grounded in patients' biomedical profiles
*   Precision matching to structured eligibility criteria
*   Patients bring relevant treatment options to doctors
*   Providers grateful for actionable care options

**Automating delivery of consumer-grade information based on keywords is worth $237B.**
**The value of delivering health information based on medical-grade reasoning?**
**A whole new multi-billion dollar category awaits.**

## Slide 9: Some common misconceptions about Resonata

**Some common misconceptions about Resonata**

**Attracting patients will be slow and costly**
Resonata does not intend to recruit patients directly to its platform.
*   API connections to Patient Services Partners (PSPs - e.g. portals, personal health apps)
*   Our only patient-facing UI is a white-label options viewer presented via PSPs
*   PSPs gain value-added functionality and participate in a rev-share pool. For Resonata, this is a fixed COGS %.

**Patients rely on their providers to tell them about treatments and trials**
For providers, every patient can't be a research project.
*   In our direct experience, delivering information into decision meetings via the patient is beneficial
*   Providers are grateful for patients who arrive with carefully matched care options

**EMRs will present guideline & trial information to providers**
EMRs are not effective decision support tools
*   Guidelines - slow to integrate the newest medicines
*   Trials - EMR integration only harvests intramural patients – sponsors need to access all eligible patients

9

## Slide 10: Why every other approach misses the target

**Why every other approach misses the target**

**DTC Marketing**
*(Icon: TV)*
Demographic targeting, at best. Mostly off-target
Waste factor: 95% reaches wrong patients/wrong time

**Provider sales/marketing**
*(Icon: Megaphone & speaker)*
Pitch product, hope doctor encounters eligible patient later
Problem: Timing/message separated from patient context

**EMR integration**
Example: Paradigm
*(Icon: Monitor with patient records)*
Alerts presented during patient visit
Problem: Only see patients from within site. Scales poorly.

**Resonata**
*(Icon: Resonata logo)*
Product/service/trial message goes directly to **actually** eligible patients
Result: Patient gains agency. Provider sees the option **in context** of eligible patient.

**Treatment options reach the point of care at the right time –**
**Giving patients improved agency and impact in decision moments**

## Slide 11: Matches only matter when conversion happens

**Matches only matter when conversion happens**
**Market-leading match logic reinforced with practical, empathetic stakeholder solutions**

|                               | Patients (+and their providers)                                                                    | Trial sponsors                                                               | Trial enrollers                                                                 | Commercial teams                                                               |
| :---------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Obstacles to conversion – existing solutions** | Many finds on c-t.gov or consumer sites – impenetrable, hard to prioritize                 | *   Recontacting restrictions<br/>*   Can't disclose full selection criteria (weaker matches)<br/>*   Too many touchpoints | *   Low quality matches – have tuned out or even banned outside referrals<br/>*   Time-consuming to review<br/>*   Difficult to onboard extramural patients | *   Contacting restrictions – can triangulate via doctors<br/>*   Can't disclose full selection criteria (weaker matches) |
| **Resonata's unique solution** | *   Matches given with detailed reasoning & qualification paths<br/>*   White-label interface with filters/ sorting | *   Patients are recontactable (no PII)<br/>*   Offer manager: securely enter private selection criteria<br/>*   One central clearinghouse   | *   Detailed reasoning – high match credibility<br/>*   Workbench for adjudication & follow-up<br/>*   Direct data delivery to CTMS for approved pts     | *   Patients are directly targeted (no PII)<br/>*   Enroller workbench tuned to work for medical affairs teams |

**Years of personal experience with these pain points informed Resonata's holistic approach**

## Slide 22: Sustainable competitive advantages

**Sustainable competitive advantages**

*(Icon: Network effects & switching costs)*
**Network effects & switching costs**
*   First-mover advantage in creating critical mass of structured offer content, accelerated by AI extraction from public sources, e.g. clinicaltrials.gov & drug package inserts
*   Enrollers develop workflow dependencies and platform expertise, creating switching costs
*   Enrollers as the lynchpin for clinical adoption. When they use Resonata for one offer, they will demand it for all their programs and sponsors.
*   Leverage clinical relationships to access commercial teams

*(Icon: Proven foundation with execution moat)*
**Proven foundation with execution moat**
*   Experienced founder: 2,000 successfully matched patients using trial-level criteria complexity
*   Know-how dependency: methodology requires deep expertise to implement effectively. AI helps but cannot replace know-how.

*(Icon: Patient-centric market position)*
**Patient-centric market position**
*   Work through empowered patients, not physician targeting
*   Engagement approach vs. promotional messaging differentiates from competitors

22

## Slide 23: Initial Partnerships

**Initial Partnerships**

*(Logo: cancer commons)*
**Development, Patient Services**
*   Patient Services Partner
    *   API connection to obtain matches (rev share)
*   Criteria extraction improvements
*   Add match prioritization
*   Enrollment tracking & addressing blockers
**Status:** Agreement in principle

*(Logo: Quest Diagnostics)*
**Commercial cancer testing**
**Pilot partner**
*   Minimum residual disease testing - Patient targeting (Paid impressions)
**Status:** Strong interest, awaiting product preview

## Slide 24: Resonata for Clinical Teams - Platform pricing that scales with project size

**Resonata for Clinical Teams**
**Platform pricing that scales with project size**
**Pre-Approval Segment**

**Base pricing: $10K per site per month**

**Biotech Phase 2**
10 sites x $10K x 12 months:
**$1.2M annually**
$100K monthly revenue

**Pharma Phase 3**
50 sites x $7.5K x 12 months:
**$4.5M annually**
$375K monthly revenue

**Why this model works**
*   Value-aligned – customers pay for what they use
*   Network effect – enrollers will demand Resonata for all their programs/sponsors
*   Scales naturally - larger trials, higher revenue
*   Predictable – not penalized for things out of our control
*   Enterprise-friendly - familiar SaaS pricing model

**Effective price per site table:**

| Site count | Discount | Effective price per site | Customer type |
| :--------- | :------- | :----------------------- | :------------ |
| 1-9        | 0%       | $10.0K                   | Small biotech |
| 10-49      | 15%      | $8.5K                    | Growth biotech|
| 50-99      | 25%      | $7.5K                    | Regional pharma|
| 100+       | 35%      | $6.5K                    | Global pharma |

## Slide 25: Resonata for Commercial Teams - Precision content delivery drives mutual value

**Resonata for Commercial Teams**
**Precision content delivery drives mutual value**
**Commercial segment**

**Price per impression = a negotiated percentage of the 1-year revenue of treatment**

**Large market generic**
$1,000/yr treatment, 5% delivery fee
100,000 offer deliveries * $50
**$5M annually**
10% adoption * 5 years on treatment →
$50M pharma rev impact: **10X ROI**

**Patented high-QOL impact drug**
$20,000/yr treatment, 7% delivery fee
1,000 offer deliveries * $1,400
**$2.8M annually**
15% adoption * 5 years on treatment →
$15M pharma rev impact: **5.5X ROI**

**Why this model works**
*   Value-aligned – high pharma ROI for precision targeting
*   Scales naturally - commercial teams will add treatments/ indications over time
*   Repeat business – pharma will keep campaigns open year after year
*   Pay for performance – no cost if patients aren't targeted

25

## Slide 26: Pricing Justified by Market Economics

**Pricing Justified by Market Economics**

**Clinical trial benchmarks**
*   Industry recruitment costs: $6,533 average per pt enrolled
*   Patient replacement costs: $19,533 per dropped patient, average dropout rate in oncology 20%.
*   Trial delay costs: $600K-$8M per day in lost revenue
*   Average patient cost per trial: $41,413
*   Conventional cost estimation: (10 sites/ 200 subjects)
    *   $1.31M recruitment, 18 months
    *   15% attrition replacement: $585K
    *   Direct costs: $1.86M

**Our price: $10K/site/mo.**
*   Resonata costs (same trial): $1.2M/yr, recruitment in 12 months, no incremental cost for attrition backfills.
*   With fixed site costs, recruitment cost is comparable.
*   6 month recruiting improvement, at $600K/day = $108M recovered revenue opportunity cost
*   Plus intangible value: enrollers are a key stakeholder for sponsors, and Resonata makes their job easier.
**Neutral on direct costs & massive impact on drug lifetime value and enroller relationships**

**Commercial marketing benchmarks**
*   Traditional pharma marketing: $20.9M/yr median promotional spend per drug
*   Marketing efficiency: Only 10% of eligible patients reached effectively
*   Waste factor: 95% of marketing reaches wrong patients
*   Digital cost/lead: $47-$100+ with poor targeting precision
*   Conventional cost estimation ($5,000/yr drug, 50K patients eligible market)
    *   $75/lead * 10,000 leads = $750K
    *   * 10% accuracy * 15% adoption = 15 pts on drug
    *   5 yr revenue = $375K; ROI = **0.5X**

**Our price: 5-7% of drug annual cost per qualified impression**
*   Resonata costs (same drug): $350/lead. 2,142 qualified impressions for same cost.
    *   * 100% accuracy * 15% adoption = 320 patients on drug
    *   5 yr revenue = $8.00M; ROI = **10.7X**

**20X realized improvement in marketing efficiency**
