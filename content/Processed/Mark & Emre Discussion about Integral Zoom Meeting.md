### Current Business & Data Infrastructure

- Financial services require revenue aggregation from subsidiaries; NDC data from FDA requires extensive curation as labelers intentionally obscure brand descriptions
- Teams of 6-12 people needed vs competitors (Definitive, IQVIA) using offshore teams with lower quality data
- Using LLMs to parse 10Ks and IRS forms for nonprofit corporate hierarchies
- Built comprehensive hierarchical definitions for provider and payer organizations
- Recent build included 235 medical practices (up from 189) through price transparency and remit data tax ID to NPI relationships

### Strategic Partnerships & Opportunities

- RepPrep.ai discussion - potential investment opportunity to compete with Scout/AcuityMD
- Tuva Partnership Status:
	- Had partnership discussions before Aaron’s surgery
	- Proposed clean room in OMOP model for TUVA data model
	- Planned 50/50 revenue share for ACO data sales
	- Currently on hold as Tuva focuses on enterprise sales (Multicare, Hinge Health, biopharma, Oscar)

### Future Vision & Value Creation

- First QHIN that lives between identified and de-identified space
- Key challenge: Half of organizations (e.g. BMS) can’t access patient services/hub data
- Solution components:
	- Pull charts, de-identify data
	- Research as permitted use under TEFCA
	- Patient consent management and IRB approval
	- Potential business combination with Seqster
- Projects $500M in value creation over next 18 months
- Key stakeholders: Venrex, Finn, Shruthi, LiveRamp

### Partnership Structure Options

- Exclusive QHIN services arrangement
- Reseller partnership with joint product vision
- Integration with claim stacking capabilities
- Focus on solving TAM/SAM/SOM challenges as independent company

### Financing & Control

- $25M funding gap to fill before exit
- Previous attempts:
	- Trinity Capital Partners deal reached final docs
	- Comerica expansion from $40M to $65M failed in syndication
- Maintaining control priority over valuation concerns
- Board alignment critical for strategic decisions
- Series A positioning as largest preferred shareholder
