Pharmacy based solutions for unsolvable Health System ProblemsT.J. Grimm RPH MBA9.13.2024

## Slide 2

Outpatient concerns – Executive Summary

The Problem
Health Systems have not prioritized their outpatient pharmacy operations
Health Systems are unable to provide adequate primary care utilizing traditional medical models
Twice as many primary care physicians exit vs. enter the work force every year. Median age is 54
17+% are over 65
Median age of an Rn is 52 and increasing, with 1M nurses (800k of them RNs) to leave the workforce by 2027.  
Prescription volume is sent to traditional retail pharmacies that have no access to medical records, no ability to provide financial assistance, and no access to the medical record or prescriber
Traditional retail pharmacies do not have access to 340b prescription pricing. Current model is unsustainable
CVS closed almost 1k stores last year, Walgreens 2k+ this year
RiteAid just came out of ch. 11, closing 900 stores

## Slide 3

The pharmacy Opportunity – Executive Summary

The Opportunity
Clinical ambulatory pharmacy (non-dispensing) operations create high value clinical outcomes
Pharmacists, under a CPA, can prescribe medications after diagnosis
Can help fill the primary care prescriber gap
Median age of a pharmacist is 41 and decreasing. Twice as many enter vs. exit the work force annually 
With 340b pricing Health systems retail pharmacy operations are much more profitable than chains
$2M annual profit for every 1,000 optimized chronic disease patients captured internally
For every dollar of prescribed specialty medications there is $2.50-$4 in prescribed chronic disease retail medications waiting to be captured internally

## Slide 5

Post Discharge Pharmacist Longitudinal Care Plan“The Platinum Plan”

---

## Slide 6

The Platinum Plan

The Problem
14% of patients are readmitted to the hospital within the first 30 days, at an average cost of $15,200
Rates and costs per patient are higher for patients with chronic disease states
MI, HF, Stroke, Diabetes, Asthma / COPD, CKD
Our program uses pharmacists to supplement the traditional model of care for patients with chronic disease states
It prevents 125 readmissions per 1,000 patients enrolled
$1.9M annual readmissions savings
The program is funded entirely by internal prescription capture utilizing 340b pricing
Not only self funded but over $2M in annual profit per 1,000 patients enrolled
Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) are minimized with access to charity care and copay mitigation
Implementation of Platinum will drive your target disease state Meds2Beds program to 80%

## Slide 7

How it works

Patient speaks to readmission team within 72 hours and sees physician within 14 days, same as any other patient
Patient is referred to pharmacist for follow up and future prescribing
Pharmacist sees patient day 15 or after out of 340b eligible clinic space
Pharmacist med optimizes (GDMT based prescribing)
GDMT – Guideline Directed Medical Therapy
Asks patient to fill prescriptions internally
Access to Health system suite of expense mitigation options
Follows up to ensure adherence
50% of patients will fill internally

DOAC Conversion Clinic

---

## Slide 9

DOAC Conversion Clinic

The Problem
Coumadin (warfarin) has many side effects and drug interactions
Warfarin requires frequent labwork and is a drain on healthcare labor
DOACs are an exceptional replacement for warfarin
40% are only on warfarin, instead of a DOAC, because of cost (SDOH)
DOAC usage varies significantly by health system
Most could double their DOAC prescribing, and capture most prescriptions in house.
Nursing labor currently in Coumadin clinic could be repurposed to the hospital, decreasing the need for travelling nurse staffing
DOAC conversion clinic is entirely self funded
$4M annual profit for every 1,000 converted patients

DOACs now recommended over warfarin to prevent blood clots in people with atrial fibrillation - Harvard Health

## Slide 10

How it works

Patients are identified during physician and lab visits 
Patient is referred to pharmacist for follow up and future prescribing
Pharmacist med optimizes (GDMT based prescribing)
Ensures patient is clinically eligible for DOACs (some patients aren’t)
Asks patient to fill prescriptions internally
Access to Health system suite of expense mitigation options
Follows up to ensure adherence
90% of patients will fill internally

Ambulatory Clinical Pharmacy Care MOdel

## Slide 12

Ambulatory and Retail Pharmacy

The Problem
America provides sick care, Ambulatory care is often a money loser for health systems
Systems must move to value-based care, population health, ACO models of care

The Opportunity
Pharmacy is the secret to achieving both the clinical metrics and profitability
$2M in profit for every 1,000 patients captured internally when utilizing 340b
