## Mural Health – Current Customers
### (Current Customer) Cindy Grabowski, VP Clinical Affairs at Sonex
**Key Takeaways:**
* Expanded initial single study expanded to four-year contract across two studies and 2K participants
* ~15-25% reduction in participant attrition to achieve 95-100% after Year 1
* Ripped-and-replaced LedgerRun+TangoCard for Mural Health mid-trial
* Cited that Mural Health enables more flexible participant payments, simplifies participant transportation, improves communication, and facilitates real-time visibility into participant experience / feedback
* Data will be criticized if you don't retain a sufficient number of patients through clinical trial
* NPS: 12 ("they are awesome, I haven't seen anything this innovative")

**Full Notes:**
**Are you a current Mural Health customer?**
* Yes; Sonex signed a four year contract with Mural Health for two studies
* Met in August 2022 and signed contract In June 2023

**How did Sonex find and start using Mural Health?**
* Sonex has a post-market tier one device and needed two studies to get CPG approval.
* One study was an RTC. Payments were handled through LedgerRun (Tangocard)
    * This study only had 120 participants, so retention was important.
    * The experience with LedgerRun was bad: poor participant feedback on rollout, no tracking.
* Second study was a single arm in-office study with 149 participants
    * Started with LedgerRun and Tangocard again, but the experience was still bad, so they pivoted two months into the trial.
    * Evaluated Mural Health and Greenphire. Chose Mural Health and moved all participant and site payments in June 2023 year
* Sonex is currently using Mural Health for a two year study with 2,000 participants across 50 sites

**What products/services does Sonex provide?**
* Sonex sells medical devices that are used in minimally invasive, office-based surgeries.
* One example is carpal tunnel syndrome relief. Only 500,000 of 2.2M annual diagnoses are operated on.
    * Most popular surgery is an incision in the palm. The carpal tunnel ligament is clipped, and healing takes 3 months.
    * Sonex has a minimally invasive device that uses ultrasound and a smaller incision.

**How does Sonex handle clinical trials?**
* No CRO; Sonex built its own clinical and data management teams.
* Sonex has its own CTP code for every indication of each product brought in.
* Clinical trials are an ongoing need, as they must perform 3-5 studies for every product. Expect a long-term relationship with Mural Health.

**How many trials do you run in a given year?**
* Expect between 4-6 new trials in the next 8 years; two trials annually

**What phase are these trials?**
* Post-market phase-4 studies
* Studies are run after Sonex receives approval, and the outcome depends on the level of evidence attained

**Are these centralized or decentralized [and retention question]?**
* [Neurology and corporate clinical studies were run?] at Boston Scientific
    * Before COVID, Sonex had 151 ongoing clinical trials. 95% were elective procedure trials.
* Struggled with retention during COVID; participants did not return. Because of this, Cindy was skeptical of decentralized trials [when she joined Sonex?]. They are disruptive for the participant set.
* Sonex did an RFP with 20 vendors. Decided on eDoc for eStudies.
    * Tested on PMFS, then Sonex CEO made the decision.
* Rolled out eDoc for EDC and they have been phenomenal. They have 95-100% data retention for all points and are integrated with Mural Health.

**Does Mural Health work for both centralized and decentralized studies?**
* Works perfectly for either.

**Do you have experience using Greenphire?**
* Sam Whittaker cold-called Cindy about Greenphire 10 years ago
    * At the time, they were struggling with participant payments. Became one of Greenphire's first 5-10 customers.
    * It worked well and the Clincard was helpful. This was innovative in 2010.
    * Greenphire provided a stack of prelabelled cards with an administration portal. It wasn't as integrated but allowed them to take on half of the duty from the sites and eliminated the need to carry cash.
    * But if they rely on Greenphire to disburse payments via the study cost, they won't pay participants until the end of the trial. This effects retention.
* Stopped using Greenphire because its price rose 3x and the marketplace [hadn't shifted to electronic payment integration]. Cindy has not used Greenphire since then.

**How did you originally come across Mural Health?**
* When using LedgerRun, Sam called Cindy and asked if Sonex had heard of Mural Health
    * Cindy spoke with Sam; she thinks highly of him and finds him innovative.
    * Did a side-by-side comparison of Mural Health and Greenphire and found Mural Health much better.
    * Mural Health removes burden from office, collects data, gives participants a voice and helps retain diverse participants.

**What functionality does Mural Health offer?**
* Integrates with Sonex database.
* Scrapes and automates payments within 24 hours of data submission.
* For site payments, Mural sends a startup payment at the start of a study, throughout the study as milestones are reached, and a final payment at the end of the study.
* Have not used the Uber partnership yet, as Sonex doesn't have participants going to site.

**What problems does Mural help Sonex solve?**
* When you do long-term study, to get 2-4 year of data you must keep participants engaged.
    * We've struggled with informing participants to keep them incentivized.
    * Historically have tried newsletters from sites to send to participants to get feedback but are always adding more to the site.
* Use Mural to send status updates and timing on data publishing, letting participants know they are making a difference.
* Allows us to connect with participants without their PHI/PII
* Some research coordinators are very diligent, but the site-to-participant relationship keeps them in the loop. With decentralized studies, Sonex will be more disconnected.
    * With mural we get participant data within 24 hours and a mission registry of 2,000 participants enrolled over 18 months.
* If a participant has a problem with their payment, they call Sonex customer service, but Sonex must relay the request to the site.
    * With Mural, any participants with a payment issue can contact Mural directly.

**Mural can pay in 24 hours; how does that compare to competitors?**
* Greenphire makes the same claim but in reality, it takes 2-7 days, because payments must be loaded onto their cards. Mural's setup and reporting times are much faster.

**How does Mural perform in payment flexibility?**
* Everyone can do EBT and debit card payments, but Mural can do Venmo, PayPal, and Zelle.

**Why can't Greenphire offer the same payment flexibility?**
* Greenphire claims to do EBT, debit, checks and e-Visa.
* Greenphire has stopped innovating. It is expensive and slow. Their team knows the current system well but has no control over product roadmap or innovation.
* Sonex itself needs to stay innovative and move quickly, so this is an important quality in a vendor.

**What is your experience with the e-Visa card?**
* It's like a ClinCard, but digital. The eVisa is a Visa credit card number for use in digital transactions.
* Sites/sponsors release money onto the card. Sites approve payment and notify participants via email. This was innovative when Greenphire started and was good for marketing to participants.
* There are some issues with the eVisa card:
    * $3/mo. servicing fee that increases after the study ends.
    * If the participant can't figure out how to get the card live, Greenphire or Tango Card keeps that money. Sonex has no way to track or verify whether patients are getting payments.
    * eVisa is especially challenging for elderly participants.

**What happens if participants lose the card?**
* You run into a lot of fraud. We have no way of verifying if its valid, we usually take the word of the participant.

**What are the transportation options with Greenphire vs Mural Health?**
* Typically get invoices from sites, which are qualified in contract. A research coordinator or nurse would set up transportation (taxi, Uber, Lyft) and Sonex would pay in 30 days.
    * Reconciliation takes 5-10 hours of internal admin time.
* Transportation is often a gating issue for participants coming into trials.
* In the recent RFP, both Greenphire and Mural Health said they have this built in.
    * Mural Health has a better participant UX than Greenphire.
    * The integrated nature of Mural Health, specifically around transportation (Uber and transportation payment built-in), greatly improves retention of participants from black, brown, and urban communities.

**Can you dive deeper into site invoices?**
* These are renewal fees for participant transportation built into site contracts. Depending on the type of study, participant transportation and accommodations are separate from other budgeting.
    * Onus is typically on sites.
* Mural Health's solution is a holding account to be drawn down from. Sonex can decide if it needs everyone approved, or will let the sites draw down and submit invoice evidence. Mural also provides reporting and tracking.

**Can you expand on the reporting and tracking provided?**
* This has historically been difficult. Site payments must be reconciled so each site can be paid out.
    * Cindy provides site and participant payment budgets for each site of a trial. As they are being paid out, she tracks budgeted versus actual payments. Sunshine reporting act requires accounting by site.
    * Mural provides a participant and site report, which has made a big difference. They know how much to pay each research hospital. Without Mural, it takes weeks to itemize expenses, create reports, and go back and forth with physicians on validation.
    * Ledger Run has struggled to provide something comparable; it wasn't built for this.

**What time savings does Mural Health provide?**
* Without Mural, sunshine reporting took one week for accounting and approvals. With Mural, it takes two hours.
* Greenphire saves time on internal accounting but the approval process is still time-consuming. Greenphire has a lack of urgency, where Mural Health continues discovery on the problem for further time savings and value.

**Back to transportation, does Mural offer white glove [service?] for hotel and transportation?**
* Sonex hasn't needed this, but usually its ad-hoc: a site coordinator gives an estimate, and the slush fund covers it.
* With Mural, they have the invoiceable hold fund.
* With Greenphire, they would push funds to ClinCards in 2-7 days, but the participant had to submit receipts. Sites then send for approval; it requires a lot of admin work.

**How challenging is participant recruitment? How important is this?**
* Each population is different.
* Direct to participant [outreach? Payments?] leads to rapid enrollment. Sonex enrolled its RTC in two months.
* With ePro, Sonex told participants they could do it remote after first site visit, and knew participants would provide data.
    * Need 95-100% of data attribution.
    * To use ePro you need a smartphone.
    * Need to get rapid payment.
    * And need communication with them to win hearts and minds. Participant has to believe they are making a difference.

**How challenging is participant retention? How important is this?**
* Sonex has had great retention with Mural; 98-100% retention in the two trials using Mural.
* A majority of Sonex participant population is middle class and Caucasian. To improve diversity, they need to solve the tech problem. Not everyone has wifi or a smartphone, which shouldn't preclude trial participation. Trials need to meet participants where they sit economically.
* Retention is also about engagement. Clinical data is needed for approval. ePro provides excellent data.

**How do you quantify the ROI of Mural Health?**
* For Sonex's 2,000 participant registry, the cost of mural health and Greenphire are about the same
* but I sat down with our CEO about the value of keeping participant in studies and the cost of losing participants.
* Loss of study participants creates a risk that the data will be criticized. The lower the participant churn, the stronger the study findings are, which is hugely valuable.
* Sonex leadership would pay an additional $100,000 (over $5M base study cost) for a 5% increase in retention.

**How has the ROI played out in use?**
* Sonex needed to start RTC in July 2022, complete enrollment by January 2023, and clean and publish by May for CTC publication in June 2023.
    * When they switched off Ledger/Tango, they wanted to figure out what percentage of participants hadn't redeemed their Tango card. Mural was extremely helpful here: 20 participants had been missed, and they paid them via Mural.
    * It was important to make patients feel heard as the study wrapped up. Mural added reporting and created a better environment for participant participation.

**NPS**
* 12/10
* "They are awesome, I haven't seen anything this innovative in participant payments/engagement."

**What is the average cost of a participant?**
* Not sure.
* Typical studies see 10% participant attrition in the first year, then 10-15% in years 2-8.
* With Mural, Sonex has seen 4% attrition in the first year of one study and 0% in the first six months of another study.

**What is the cost per lost participant?**
* It depends, exponentially more expensive the more participants you lose.
* 10% attrition is expected.
* At 25% attrition, one more churned participant could be worth $100,000.

### (Current Customer) Kimberly Ferguson – Roche Holding AG, Global Head of Digital Partnerships
**Key Takeaways:**
* Roche management model is highly disseminated with each clinical team selecting software
* Retention of participants in clinical trials is expensive (~$25-30K per participant)
* Primary cause of participant dropout is an inability to directly connect with participants in the trial and challenges around monetary compensation and transportation
* Currently using Mural Health in one decentralized neurology trial across six sites domestically
* Mural Health addresses the pain points of participant dropouts with a best-in-class user interface for physicians and participants, effectively replacing ~3 vendor solutions
* Access to a smartphone is the only requirement for participants to use Mural Health
* Mural Health may struggle to support Western Europe (due to heightened regulation), but could support any clinical trial in the United States or developing country
* Expert reported a 20% increase to the speed of participant enrollment when using Mural Health compared to others
* Difficult to quantify value given long-term nature of clinical trials, but retention of participants translates to a faster read out on the data from a clinical trial, which enables speed-to-market for highly profitable drugs.
* NPS: 9

**Full Notes:**
**Tell us about your role as Global Head of Partnerships at Roche Holding AG?**
* Works at Genentech / Roche, a family-held company that is often considered the largest global company combining pharmaceuticals and diagnostics.
* Genentech represents all pharmaceutical work in the U.S., while Roche is focused on international - with a primary focus in oncology, neurology, and rare disease.
* Expert is responsible for managing the efficiency of clinical trials primarily through technology (e.g., software platforms, wearables) designed to expedite and improve outcomes.
* Expert allocates most of her time to late-stage clinical trials.
* Company operates in a highly disseminated management model where each clinical trial team determines which solutions to use for the management of that trial.

**How did you get introduced to Mural Health?**
* Introduced to Mural Health via "normal due diligence process for partnerships."
* Paid customer of Mural Health for six months (three-month sales cycle)
* Deployment of Mural Health in one clinical trial across six sites
* Currently using Mural health in one domestic, decentralized clinical trial across six sites focused on neurology.

**Why did you select Mural Health?**
* Company has 10-year ambitions and one of those is to increase diversity, equity, and inclusion in clinical trials and found a lack of representation in this trial from the male black community, so they were writing algorithms to compensate for the lack of representation.
* Company noted primary reasons behind their dropout rates were an inability to directly connect with participants in the trial, monetary compensation challenges, and transportation challenges.
* Company wanted a platform that was easier for elderly and less technologically savvy participants to engage with, especially for this initial trial since it focused on military veterans living in remote places.
* Expert noted Mural Health had one of the best communication portals in the industry and enabled physicians to trigger the interventions necessary to keep a participant engaged in a clinical trial and anticipate potential problems before they happen – which could be done with internal data scientists but would be slow.
* Mural Health checked all these boxes and aggregated payments / transportation in a neat, simplified package.
* Company noted using ~3 vendors in prior clinical trials to achieve the same value offered by Mural Health

**How representative is the clinical trial with Mural Health of the rest of the company's work?**
* Company approaches piloting a new software solution or technology in a limited and controlled way, which is representative of how the company operates.
* Expert noted that an optimal initial clinical trial to deploy a new solution like Mural Health is for a drug that is already on the market (e.g., adjuvant therapy potential, label extension, etc.) since it's a relatively small, controlled environment without a huge participant population and knowledge of the problem is high.
* Expert estimated a small, controlled trial environment somewhere below 600 participants.
* Expert noted that decentralized trials are a strong use case for Mural Health

**How many trials does the company manage across all divisions and what percentage are a fit for Mural Health?**
* Expert could not share the number of clinical trials.
* Expert reported 60% of clinical trial work is on molecules new to the pipeline and, therefore, the company does not have historical experience with them, and the remaining 40% are label extensions or different applications to the same medication in a different disease state.
* Expert suggested Mural Health would be a strong use case for those 40%

**What percentage of trials are decentralized?**
* Reported that the industry is moving toward decentralized trials.
* Company has embraced decentralized clinical trials due to a lower dropout rate.
* Decentralized clinical trials represent about 80% of the company's clinical trial work.

**Could you use Mural health for both decentralized and centralized trials?**
* Expert reported that decentralized trials seemed like the strongest use case for Mural Health but acknowledged that centralized or hybrid trials could also work.

**Is Mural Health a solution you could use both domestically and internationally?**
* Expert reported that the initial trial using Mural Health is domestic.
* Expert reports that the Mural Health platform is simple enough to deploy in developing countries.
* Only thing participants need to use Mural Health is access to a smartphone and the company estimates 89% of the population has access to a smartphone.
* Expert noted that payment methodology may change in developing countries.
* Expert noted that Western European countries would be difficult to implement Mural Health in due to the heightened regulatory environment.

**How do you quantify the value proposition of Mural Health?**
* Company quantifies value through a "futility test," which is an initial read out of the data from the clinical trial (e.g., dropout rates, number of adverse events) – that test helps us determine whether a new platform like Mural Health really makes a difference.
* Company is not at the point where the data from the clinical trial has been read out in any form, but the expert reports hearing good things.
* Expert reports a 20% increase to the speed of participant enrollment when using Mural Health compared to other solutions (e.g., in-house solutions), attributed to the simplicity of the platform.
* Enrolling and retaining participants translates to a faster read out on the data from a “futility test."
* Value comes primarily from the clinical trial occurring with the full quantity of participants needed to represent the group they're looking for and getting to the end point where you can read out the data more quickly and, ultimately, get more participants on the medication earlier in their disease journey.
* Speed is the name of the game, and the Mural health platform is one of the ways to simplify enrollment and maintain a population to get a meaningful read out from the data.
* Expert acknowledged this is a hard number to quantify.
* Every time a participant drops out of a trial, the company loses $25-30K, which is a number you could quantify.
* Expert acknowledged that absorbing the costs associated with a clinical trial is not a big deal, so they tend not to talk about the finances of what the value is they bring until they've first seen a futility study.

**How much are you paying for Mural Health annually?**
* Expert recalls being given two pricing models: one was a blanket subscription level service and the other was per participant.
* Company opted to pay $525 per participant to Mural health for enrollment and support services.
* Expert reported paying additional cost for data analysis in the form of an hourly fee.

**Have you used any other competitive solutions?**
* For transportation, the company tried working directly with Uber and Lyft and reported that the effort was a failure.
* For payments, the company reported using IQVIA, tried working directly with Venmo, and managed a lot in-house.
* Company also tried to use systems integrators (e.g., EPM) to aggregate all the disparate services and reported that these can work, but they're slow.
* Expert reported no familiarity with Greenphire.

**What do you think of the Mural Health team?**
* Expert noted that the founding story of the Mural Health management team was compelling.
* Felt strong cultural alignment and interactions with the team were very positive.

**NPS: 9**
* Customer reported a 9-of-10 NPS score.
* Noted that only reason for not a 10 is because she didn't want to be absolute in her recommendations to colleagues or look like she was biasedly aligned with one particular solution so she would talk about more than one option in those discussions since it's the fair thing to do

## Greenphire (Competitor) – Current Customers
### (Greenphire Customer) Roy Marceau – Bristol-Myers Squibb, Director of Global Outsourcing Management
**Key Takeaways:**
* Company became a customer of Mural Health via acquisition of another company
* Company outsources ~80% of clinical trials today to CROs, but noted that CRO utilization is trending down and internal goal to shift to a model where ~80% are done in-house due to limited bed space and challenge of recruiting participants
* Becoming an approved vendor with BMS takes ~1-2 years, but once a Master Services Agreement is in place, they can be deployed faster
* Having a single vendor for site and participant payments prevents corruption (issues around fraud and unclaimed funds exist, noted$1.4B sitting in suspended accounts) and improves auditability
* Selected Greenphire due to 24/7 multi-lingual support, global rideshare affiliations, etc. and noted that coverage in rural / secluded areas is a gap in capability
* Unlikely to move away from Greenphire unless another vendor presented a compelling advantage
* CROs typically resist standardization on platforms like Greenphire since they profit from managing the complexity of spend and project management, while clinical sties vary in their requirements and technologies

**Full Notes:**
**Expert Background:**
* Roy is Associate Director of Global Outsourcing Management at Bristol-Myers Squibb. He is familiar with Greenphire, IQVIA, and other platforms.
* Roy manages a team that handles contracting for both insourced and outsourced clinical trials in the pharmaceutical sector. Once a clinical trial is planned, his team collaborates with the trial team to identify needs like biospecimen collection, central labs, and participant reimbursement, and then contracts and engages the appropriate suppliers and trials.

**Customer Background:**
* BMS' primary business is in clinical trials, where it spends $21Bn [annually?].
* BMS uses Mural Health as a payment platform to pay participants and manage logistics for clinical trials. Mural Health helps participants book and pay for transportation and receive payment for participation following the conclusion of the trial. Mural Health is one of multiple platforms used by BMS, depending on the therapeutic area of the trial.
* BMS became a customer of Mural Health following its acquisition of [Mile Cartea?]. Roy states they are likely to run the length of the contract, after which they plan to switch to a standard vendor. This is not a comment on Mural Health, rather part of a broader standardization initiative within BMS.

**Are you typically engaging with CROs?**
* They engage with a CRO 80% of the time, but they don't always contract all of their supplier needs through the CRO. CRO engagement is trending down.
* BMS outsources 80% of clinical trials but has implemented a program called Quantum Leap, a five-year plan to insource 80% of clinical trials.

**Why insource clinical trials?**
* The market is saturated and bed space and participants are the two main constraints.

**What makes a preferred vendor for BMS?**
* Becoming a preferred vendor takes 1-2 years, but we also have "approved vendors" that can be engaged more quickly through existing Master Services Agreements. We have over 1,000 preferred vendors, including around 100 in participant recruitment but only 4-5 in the payments space like Greenphire, IQVIA, and Metadata.

**Why only 4-5 in payments?**
* Having a single vendor for both site and participant payments helps in managing corruption and ensures auditability through a third-party single-payer system. We use Appian software to manage interactions and payments with healthcare providers, which is critical for compliance and reducing the risk of impropriety that could lead to investigations and drain internal resources.
* Payment vendors would engage BMS' finance group to become a preferred vendor.

**Why did you choose to standardize around Greenphire for payments?**
* BMS became a customer of Greenphire about three years ago.
* Roy was part of a selection committee that evaluated Greenphire and other vendors. The decision came down to the support offered by Greenphire:
    * 24/7 multi-language support (100+ languages).
* Global rideshare affiliations
* BMS has an arrangement with Greenphire to provide loaded cards to participants prior to the start of the trial. Advance payments reduces the dropout rate in some cases.

**Does Greenphire only use physical cards?**
* I think Greenphire uses a number of different vehicles: paying vendors directly, and a number of affiliations that provide enablement.

**What are the gaps in Greenphire's capabilities?**
* Covering the needs of participants in rural/secluded areas, be it providing them with the necessary technology or transportation.

**Is there an issue with Greenphire's reliance on cards?**
* Fees are a pass-through cost covered by BMS
* Requires monthly reconciliation, as participants' cards are sometimes automatically re-loaded.
* The error rate is low; only about 2%.

**Do you tend to overpay participants?**
* Issues like fraud and unclaimed funds exist. We recently found $1.4B sitting in suspended accounts. Standard operating procedures allow vendors to initiate financial reconciliation, leading to situations where the company may be owed money, and seed money is often provided to keep trials moving.

**What is your experience working with Mural Health?**
* Only experience from initial evaluation. Capabilities compared to Greenphire didn't warrant changing vendors.

**What would you need to see to warrant a change?**
* A value-add that Greenphire doesn't already have to justify the cost of switching. Site payments, for example, could warrant this.

**Are you concerned about Greenphire's fees, compared to Mural Health?**
* Fees are scaled by the size of the company; smaller ones pay more. Banking fees are inevitable, and there are costs like card replacement that someone must bear.

**What about managing the inventory of cards? Why isn't everything virtual?**
* Cards are something that work for most scenarios; otherwise, you'd need to build different products for different use cases.

**Is there any pressure to modernize this experience?**
* Yes, but we also don't want to make assumptions. Participants in rural areas may not even have the technology for digital payments. And we have not had the same issues retaining participants in urban areas.

**How long do you plan to stay standardized with Greenphire?**
* Unless something egregious occurs, the plan is to stick with Greenphire mainly due to regulatory constraints and the confidence in having one vendor to manage these complexities.

**What does 'standardized' mean?**
* Every new trial is going through Greenphire.
* They handle anywhere from 200-500 trials at a time, averaging out to about 20,000 participants. The contract with Greenphire is significant, possibly exceeding $100M annually. Costs can vary but are substantial, perhaps around $50 per participant per visit, and can increase depending on various factors like distance and country. Greenphire's revenue model might allow them to take home 30-40% of the funded amount, but they also have operational costs. Despite spending $21B on clinical trials annually, only $100M goes to Greenphire, which manages 10% of the trials. A unique feature is the white-glove service that was co-developed with Greenphire, accounting for at least half of the contract value.

**If you're standardized with Greenphire, why have preferred vendor relationships with other payment providers?**
* IQVIA is the choice for site payments, but they will phase out any participant payments done through IQVIA.

**What is the goal of standardization?**
* Ease of use, regulations and continuous improvement.

**Is cost reduction an important consideration?**
* If cost savings could be accurately quantified and presented to the right decision-maker, there might be interest in change; however, currently, companies are flush with cash and many are relocating jobs overseas, making cost reduction less of a priority.

**How much visibility does Greenphire offer?**
* Greenphire provides analytics and insights into agreed-upon KPIs using the company's Tableau interface on Salesforce. In pharma, participant safety and viability are often more important than cost.

**What does implementation with Greenphire look like?**
* Greenphire handles this; they only need to identify their needs and requirements.

**How to competitors stack up?**
* They are all competitive. BMS has been focused on the widest-reaching system.

**How does Greenphire standardization affect CROs and sites?**
* CROS: CROs resist standardization on platforms like Greenphire because they profit from managing the complexity of spend and project management, with the big four in the industry being LabCorp, IQVIA, Sineos, and PPD.
* Sites: Clinical trial sites vary in their requirements and technologies, disadvantaging smaller players; however, the landscape is evolving and trials could potentially be run from home in the next 5-10 years due to technological advancements.

* Tarsus is not a current customer of Greenphire, but expert worked with Greenphire in a prior role. Expert has also worked with CT Payer, a smaller vendor.
* CT requires a certain level of manual work to get prepaid cards sent to the site
* Greenphire is more integrated platform vs CT players
* But we got them for a lower cost vs Greenphire.
* It's more of a use case to prove such of a platform will benefit us, to smoothly handle site and participant payment

**How did the organization manage participant payments before CT Payer?**
* Using the CRO's choice of vendor
* Gift cards, checks, electronic transfer (expert notes that this method had tax implications)
* Tarsus moved away from these methods as it wanted more consistency across studies and sites rather than relying on the CRO

**What else was managed by the CRO?**
* Everything was outsourced to the CRO
* Monitoring, site selection, qualification, maintenance, ETMF. Expert brought the ETMF in when they joined.
* Tarsus had an internal team to supervise monitoring by CROs, but the heavy lift was handled by CROS

**Why did you move away from the CRO outsourced model?**
* Many reasons: CROs are good while things are on-track, meaning nothing challenging happens in the study/the use case is not too demanding
* Can be good partners, but it detaches you and comes at a large cost when things don't go well
* It makes sense to outsource to an enduring company at the early stages concept level
* Tarsus still prefers to have its internal team involved in the study execution to have skin in the game and improve the quality of the product, which is the data.

**How accountable are CROS?**
* Differs across CROS
* Tarsus is currently using 6 different CROs across 14 studies. Expert notes that this is not acceptable to their standard.
* Tarsus uses the CRO that people had worked for, or the best in class in that specific area
* Outsourcing brought a lot of issues: how investigations are handled, how fair market compensation is calculated
* One issue is turnover: CROs management leadership stays the same but beyond that there is a large amount of turnover. Expert has seen these project teams change overnight and notes it is a troubling dynamic given the team is not consistent.
* It is time consuming to train new people on protocol, what's been working, what's not falling in place. CROs fall short on that end; it is not a true partnership.
* This leads to data quality issues for Tarsus. With six different CROs, all of them constantly changing staff on sites, Tarsus ends up with different sets of data for 14 studies.

**What percentage of the industry outsources to CROs?**
* Of the companies of Tarsus' size (public companies and startups) 100% outsource their trials to CROS.
* When a company is public and into the commercial market of product lifecycle, the revenue stream is clear and company is aware of financial commitment they can make, they tend to build the internal teams across all functions.
* Medium to large sized companies have internal clinical teams; they usually use ETMF systems and internal monitoring systems rather than outsourcing to CROS.
* The cutoff is the revenue and the commercial viability of products. If Tarsus has more than one commercially viable product, they will bring the CRO in house.
* Market valuation is the main factor.
* Using internal resources is much cheaper than using CROs; 40-70% cost savings

**Who is selecting the software if you outsource a portion to CROs?**
* Typically let the CRO choose if it doesn't change the budget, which is the top priority.
* If participant recruitment and enrollment is compromised, the sponsor is more involved in making the decision.
* CROs are typically amenable to receiving that feedback from the sponsor. Expert is currently using and managing these platforms with their internal team.

**Does that apply to participant payments software as well?**
* Yes

**What was your experience with Greenphire when you used their product?**
* Helped with fair market value on participant compensation.
* Greenhpire is involved in offering strategic consultation with experts in therapeutic areas.
* Can integrate with EDC, which is a plus versus CT Payer.
* Card is automatically loaded, which removes the burden from the site.

**How are participants compensated with Greenphire?**
* Prepaid cards only
* Expert has heard about some fraud with cards: sometimes wrong amounts reflected on the cards and need to call site and provider multiple times

**Does that type of payment compensation allow you to pay all types of participants? E.g., does it work across socioeconomic, age and race groups?**
* It is a limiting factor.
* Some studies require you to enroll groups that cannot work with this payment method, regardless of means of payment.
* In ophthalmology, for example, many of the studies include elderly participants. They don't want a card; they want a check or direct deposit.
* Only having the card is a limiter with certain populations, especially across socioeconomic classes.

**Have you used Mural Health?**
* Have heard of them, but haven't invited any demos yet.
* Expert is interested in learning more about Mural.
* kdhamdhere@tarsusrx.com

**NPS for Greenphire?**
* 7-8
* It has its limitations, but it works. Prepaid cards are a thing of the past, and the fraud issues are a concern.

### (Greenphire Customer) Taymeyah Al-Toubah, Senior Clinical Research Coordinator at Moffitt Cancer Center
**Full Notes:**
**Expert Background**
* Started off doing data management in coordination, moved to a project management role in the last 6 months
* Did oncology, some Gl, phase 1 research for 3 years. Primarily with adult participants
* In phase 1, expert was primarily responsible for matching participants to trials. Once the protocol is presented, expert checks if it's feasible, whether there are barriers to enrollment, and how to overcome them.

**What is your experience working with Greenphire?**
* Phase 1 was more pharma driven, and that's where I had a lot more interactions with those tools.
* Gl and co-op studies, would be nice if they incorporated these tools. Funding is limited with some trials, and the tools that they do have are not as sophisticated as pharma studies.
* For some trials expert writes protocols, develops them and chooses vendors.
* Every disease site has a separate trials department. Each program runs 10 studies up to 30-40 active per program, well over 300-400 studies that are actively recruiting and a few more that aren't accruing but have active participants on them. Close to 200 coordinators.

**How many trials and sponsors are CROs involved in?**
* 50-60% of the portfolio is industry-based.
* The remaining 40% is divided between co-op and investigational trials.
* Co-op trials are driven by the NCI, with the protocol and budget provided by the government. There's no room for negotiation unless involved in protocol development.
* Investigational trials are funded through grants or donations. These might involve the NCI or partnerships with pharmaceutical companies that provide drugs for free. Such companies endorse but do not run the trials. The scale might vary, with some multi-center studies contracted out to CROs and others limited to a single site.

**Greenphire**
* Greenphire is introduced during the trial's initial phase, especially during investigator meetings. The discussion revolves around logistics such as the number of visits, travel, hotel coverage, etc. However, opportunities to introduce Greenphire are limited.
* When a protocol indicates a desire for reimbursement, a tech solution like Greenphire is preferred due to the challenges in manual processes. Tools like Sovota have integrated solutions, while others provide a card to load information, track visits, mileage, and accommodations.
* We hear about it during the start of trial, investigator meetings we'll have that convo before the study opens. Here are the tools, this study has x number of visits per week, we cover travel and hotels and XYZ. Brought up at that point and we rarely have an opportunity
* When I can ask for it, when I do receive a protocol if the contract says they want to cover and reimburse I ask for a tech solution to do that because the process is a pain.
* The tools that we're given, Greenphire is one of the solutions
* Some of them Sovota has an integrated one, a lot of them just cover a card that they send to us and we load on our end the information, we go into system, we put in the participant came in 5x this week, this is home address, return address, and I'll load the card, if they had mileage or hotels we'll put that on card
* When we have to manage it it's a lot easier, we've had some cards where participants have a 300-400 max per month for travel, etc. participants don't know how to keep track of that
* I prefer when there is a budget and plug 12

**What percent need Greenphire?**
* The ones that need it is 70% of studies we open
* We use it for 30% coming our way
* There are a lot of studies that tac onto standard of care, so they are coming in anyways its not an added expense and dilutes the funds for the trial to be spent in another way

**Of those that need it, why is there a gap from 70% to 30%?**
* Its negotiation, those negotiating contracts aren't aware
* They are budgeting tight, a PK visit to draw blood they don't think compensation is always needed
* Contract and budget analysts aren't asking for reimbursement solutions when they don't understand there's a transportation and time associated to get to the studies
* What they usually ask for is hotels, and that's it, and it's a small part of it but participants want Gas money to get there, or uber ride, or meals if it's a long day on-site.

**Greenphire, benefits, challenges?**
* Has evolved over the past 5 years, when I first started working with it was user friendly and clinic-first
* Now they are taking the burden off the study team and making the participants deal with it but that's backfired
* Benefits
    * Reimbursement for travel mileage is easy, its per diem for meals and mileage based on addresses
    * For hotels, they have a push to get us to use for hotels, but contracts have a cap on per night rates on hotels and it often doesn't work with the card, it's a per night not per visit
    * So we end up having to deal with a lot of reimbursement processes on the backend
    * Our system and teams aren't designed for this – we have a lodging coordinator who books hotels and we invoice sponsor on the backend
    * When you take that part out and its Greenphire only, don't want us going lodging coordinator route which can complicate things.
* Probably 2-3 hours per participant per month is spent on reconciliation, sometimes more for more complicated studies. And the issue is the process and how long it takes for the reimbursement to go through. The paperwork is painful, but it takes a very long time for the checks to cut to the patients, and you deal with a lot of frustrated participant calls
* Takes a month sometimes longer.
* A lot of the participant population doesn't want to log into a system and check into things- nontech savvy and having them go to a portal and check

**Site payments?**
* I certify visits in our CTMS systems, once I've certified that the budget team will deal with that on the backend. And if we're sent a payment higher than we were expecting there's some back and forth reconciling that. The actual payers
* Probably 3-4 emails a week and 5-1

**Two way text messaging?**
* There's a Greenphire line they can call but they need their study number and participant number - this has never worked for us
* They will call me to figure out how to reconcile on the back end or just send me a check
* And I have to say, depending on the contract there isn't always an option for that, responsible for the fees because this is the only system we have in place
* If there was a chat function that would be incredibly valuable, and its quick compliant and accessible

**Vendor selection?**
* Pharma run trials are chosen by the sponsor or the CRO 100%
* When we're doing an internal trial and we're the sponsor we choose
* IQVIA does a great job with smaller site
* Paraxel is good but very expensive so rarely first route we take
* We have our own monitoring team here, for simple studies
* 60% are pharma
* Mural health – option to bring them on for all investigative driven trials, that's fantastic. Easier to incorporate into a smaller system and partner with IQVIA
* It looks like they can book ubers through the app
* Participants are used to those systems
* One thing I would ask – if you have an elderly participant, can you allow a proxy for the app, and help a son or daughter book the ubers for them and they get alerted for car

**What would you need to hear?**
* I would like to get to trial it myself, see from the participant perspective, staff front and if its similar enough for me to convey with a participant, a lot of our work is us troubleshooting them through solutions
* Then seeing what the platform looks like

**Do sites try to measure retention and recruitment?**
* For our department and program I manage that and look into it
* CTO has a dashboard himself to monitor
* The process as a hospital hasn't been great at presenting retention, we're collecting better data points in Gl. Basic number in the EMR to capture when they are presented in a trial and when they decline, etc.
* But we keep a running list of why participants are refusing or stopping trials
* I'd have to spend a little time to figure out what retention looks like, not perfect data for us

**Do sponsors ever ask to see that data?**
* Sponsors are tracking screen fill rates and less so retention
* Concerned about # of participants screened that don't go on.
* More for me, why are they coming off, why don't they go on to begin with.
* Coming off easy to capture but why participants never went on is a datapoint we're missing
* It needs to be an EMR integration for it to function properly

**Has Greenphire helped with the conversion rate or retention?**
* It helps getting people onto trials, when they know there's a clear system for reimbursement they increase engagement.
* It helps bring people to a trial, how long it keeps the on the trial not sure it plays a role

**Average retention seen in trials – from onboarding to operating first year of trial?**
* 20% churn during enrollment
* Then we see 10-20% in the first year churn

**NPS Greenphire**
* 7/10

**What makes it a 10?**
* Easier communication, onboarding and enablement for participants
* Hotel reservation – see hotels loaded in there and participants can book rooms

### (Greenphire Customers) University of Pennsylvania - Director of Disbursements, Mike Popko
**Full Notes:**
**Background**
* Director of disbursements, joined 11 years ago
* We are administrators for the system we use - Greenphire for 8 years

**Responsibilities?**
* The processing of invoices, an accounts payable group, process about 30k invoices a month
* Also administrate a supplier portal with Jaeggar to collaborate and onboard and automate electronic invoicing. We have probably 50% of our invoices that are electronic, and the other 50% comes through email and we process those for the university

**Where are those invoices coming from?**
* We are paying invoices across the board, working with the University is like working for a city
* Sports, facilities, housing, security, etc.
* Academic side - paying research side expenses related to the work we do

**So are you using Greenphire across the university?**
* Started off with research clinical side
* But also have used them for across the campus, all student athletes us it for per diem on trips
* NCAA, Tokyo athletic trips – student programs that use the card. Been a super helpful tool
* In the past needed to go through AP, so something that used to take 2 weeks can take a couple hours with Greenphire

**Total spend on ClinCard in the university?**
* Last year was $8m and 60% was Greenphire (mostly participant payments)
* Of that $8m, Greenphire covers about $8m in the last fiscal year
* Then on top of that we have some participant payments going through AP, some using gift cards, some online research where there's tools like mechanical turk to compensate
* folks completing those surveys. About 60-70% goes through Greenphire, and that might be the limit and Greenphire isn't everything
* Had over 100k transactions go through Greenphire, $8m in spend
* And roughly we get 3.5 loads per card (plastic or virtual) on average about $65 a load

**How much are you paying Greenphire today?**
* Annual Maintenance / platform fee – $65k a year
* Variable ladder on pricing
* Inventory of plastic cards, generic and penn branded
* Generic is $3.50 per card
* Branded are $4.50 per card
* Almost 2 years ago we went on Greenphires new platform that offered a virtual card which was helpful through the pandemic and pushing payments to virtual card which is $2.15 per card
* Each load is $1.15 transaction fee
* At least $250-260k a year is going to Greenphire

**ROI on paying that $250k/year?**
* Before we had Greenphire we were processing 11-12k payment requests through AP
* Required onboarding, payment requests,
* We get a lot of time savings on the money front
* Also enhancement for coordinators to have a tool like this to keep participants happy
* And retention is very important in research, so its been a huge help
* First year we launched and after a year we ended up saying finance is going to take care of this cost
* When you have $8m going through the system you're saving people a lot of time

**Measurable impact on retention?**
* No just the feedback verbally
* We've heard that it has helped with retention and engagement, but we don't have numbers around that to back it up unfortunately
* Satisfaction from participants that are getting paid helps them come back for visit 2, 3, 4

**Estimate the time savings from using Greenphire vs after, how would you quantify?**
* Gone from 2 weeks to 2 hours
* Onboarding, payment request, approval, getting in system, payment processed, check mailed out, participant needing to go to bank to cash check – it's a big difference
* Centrally we administer system, set up studies, give access of cards (physical or virtual), then we might setup milestone payments per request – then coordinators can go in, sign up a participant, load a card in a few minutes.
* Went from 12k to 300 AP payment requests
* Electronic invoicing 30% to 50%+
* Cut check printing down by 20%
* All these automations helped the group not need more people to process more invoices, so have been able to realign 2 people away from manual processing, and we also lost 2 people that we decided to not backfill due to the efficiencies

**People saved?**
* Overall group we saved 2 people
* But we've also automated a lot of things internally on our AP processing side
* So Greenphire saved a little less than 2
* But every dept at penn, the research and need to support study. That has gone from having to put paperwork together, submit payment requests, follow up, etc, that's where the big savings happen in these departments, that's saved several headcount
* If you look at studies we have over 1,000 users per study, usually 1000 studies and programs going on, so 1 coordinator for each study is typical. And we think they can do 10-20% more studies given the efficiencies. And we've been able to take on more research.

**Greenphire - our understanding the sponsor decides which vendor to use? Is that the case for Penn?**
* We have studies where we are sponsor and outsource studies to other sites
* We have studies where we are the site, and they are the sponsor and they make the payments
* We own the site, the budget and oversight of all the studies that are helping us
* Some coordinators use Greenphire, they have to sign or get into a separate site if they are from a different sponsor
* At the end when we set it up, need agreement and direction on how we're going to pay participants

**Opportunities for improvement?**
* There's some fraud so were working to get multifactor authentication
* I'd love to have some data warehouse so we can write our own reports
* Also with the cards, we get inventory and its hard to track from time to time
* So some better tracking and they expire after 3 years so it gets complex
* Greenphire does have messaging but its 1 way communication to participant
* This is for scheduling and payments
* Would love to have 2 way to contact coordinator and back integrated with the system
* We do a journal every month to post the comp and reimbursements
* We'd like to have some integration or file there that we can upload, but we have to set up and manipulate a report
* That will finally connect into oracle, takes a while to get that in there
* We have minor participants (under 18) and senior participants
* So having a custodial capability would be very helpful on comms and payments
* Greenphire has a ride share with Lyft, we don't use it I don't know why
* It could be helpful to demo it with the coordinators, but we have our own logistics vendors on campus we use
* We do get a 1099 file, a tin matching capability. We didn't turn that on, we connect into sovos and do our own tin matching capability
* Had to put a ton of process up front for Greenphire
* Funding was simplified and all studies pull from one budget
* We set budgets for studies and its tracked
* And we have a form we've built into helpdesk – fresh service that handles p2p support and one form is Greenphire to request studies or other stuff and we have nothing outstanding
* Once we get that approval its manual, semi-manual
* Assign the person, give access to that study,
* All that had to be built before we started using Greenphire
* Took a lot of administrative burden on our side before getting going
* Some retailers don't accept cards, depends on the bank they use
* Now with the new virtual card we have the ability to transfer in to the bank account
* Or digital wallet

**Have you heard of Mural Health?**
* I spoke to mural health in the last few months to understand the product a bit more
* With Greenphire and moving to their new platform recently, Im less interested in doing the whole system switch given how difficult and how long it took with Greenphire
* But I also do want to get to know the other teams
* I loved 2 way chat
* And payment options
* Just on disbursement side in how we pay we're looking at other digital options – ACH, Zelle, Venmo, other easier payment methods. And its giving that and empowering the payee to use and I saw that in mural health and thought it was impressive
* Also thought their mobile app was significantly better than Greenphire
* We met mural health probably 2 months ago, maybe in August early-Aug

**Hesitancy rooted in the migration / system implementation?**
* Yes it was that primarily
* But also we have 1000+ users using Greenphire for a while, and to make the change you have to have a really good reason. Some studies last 1 week and some last 5 years.
* So now we have to re-assign cards, migrate and it better be much better than what we have and change isn't really easy at a university
* So I thought it was important to see what Mural had, and if its something we want to consider in case Greenphire doesn't improve, but it's a difficult thing to switch off of.
* And third was probably the maturity of the company, how long have they been out there, how many customers do they have, etc. that was some of the hesitancy

**What will you need to see from mural health to be meaningfully better than Greenphire?**
* I'd want to see some more growth and product maturity
* And I'd need to better understand what migration and implementation looks like – feels like it would take a few years to get off Greenphire. Could get a few coordinators open to a change, but it would be a roll off so you're paying and managing two systems till you can fully migrate over to mural
* So anything to help that migration would convince me more that this is doable and I could see this happening
* And If mural could qualm those concerns, I would definitely be willing to pilot it with a few coordinators to compare and contrast vs Greenphire. So then we have a track record of getting participant feedback and see that it works.
* Or maybe we do all new studies on mural, and start winding down Greenphire.

**What's the participant and coordinator feedback on Greenphire?**
* Weve done a survey to coordinators, not participants
* For coordinators, they were happy, like a 4/5 satisfaction
* Greenphire support is being revamped, we aren't happy with the support right now
* And I do know Stanford/USC is leaving Greenphire due to their support.
* Concerns me a little bit, we have our biweekly meetings. One of the managers is on their advisory group, we participate in some of their events.
* Weve had things on our list that hasn't been covered for a while
* It's a mixed bag, I feel okay/alright with them – its not too bad but it could be better

**NPS for Greenphire**
* I'd give them a 9
* Software is easy, not much training and it helps with reporting we used to do
* Its been a savior for us over the last 8 years, and the virtual card with visa is helpful that was much needed by them and it was huge. If they didn't implement that they'd be in trouble.

## Greenphire (Competitor) – Executive Perspectives
### (Former Competitor Employee) John Capurso – Greenphire, CRO Partner Manager
**Key Takeaways:**
* The expert has experience in the clinical payment space, specifically related to participants or participants and clinical trial sites.
* Greenphire, provides solutions for clinical payments. They started with participant reimbursement (ClinCard), added travel assistance, site payment solutions, and budget creation for investigator sites.
* The budget creation feature is a crucial component that outlines the payment framework for investigator sites, ensuring clarity and agreement on payment amounts for study activities.
* Greenphire's revenue breakdown includes around 60-65% from sponsor companies (large and small pharma) and approximately 35-40% from CRO partnerships. CROs act as multipliers, helping introduce Greenphire's solutions to a wider range of pharma clients.
* Challenges include perceptions that Greenphire's technology hasn't kept up with the latest advancements in payment methods, with some competitors offering more modern payment solutions.
* The discussion also touches on the use of physical debit cards for payments in clinical trials and the desire for more flexible payment methods like Zelle or Venmo, although adoption is slow due to industry regulations.
* Greenphire has made changes to enhance payment flexibility, including switching payment providers to offer more options and lower costs for transactions within different countries.
* Site satisfaction, mainly from investigator sites, is somewhat lower due to some resistance to adopting new technologies, even if they improve processes.
* Solutions like Mural Health and Scout Clinical are considered as threats to Greenphire, especially in the participant payment space. Smaller companies, such as LedgerRun, are also emerging as potential competitors due to their specialized solutions and partnerships for operational support.
* Greenphire launched an app in response to competitor offerings, aimed at enhancing participant engagement and expanding into participant registries and real-world data collection. They made an acquisition to build the app, indicating a competitive approach rather than a hasty reaction.
* Industry Trends:
    * The number of clinical trials, particularly in the U.S., may decrease due to economic factors and concerns about drug pricing.
    * Smaller biotech companies might face funding challenges, impacting their ability to conduct large-scale trials.

**Full Notes:**
**Expert Background**
* Expert was the CRO Partner Manager at Greenphire, leaving in May 2023.

* He sought a role in a smaller company where he could actively pursue new opportunities.

**What is Greenphire, and what need did it address in the clinical studies field?**
* Greenphire is a company that addressed the need to streamline and simplify participant payments in clinical studies. They filled this need by providing solutions for participant reimbursement, travel reimbursement, and site payment management.

**How does Greenphire handle site payment budgeting and what is its significance?**
* Greenphire assists in creating budgets for site investigations, which serve as legal documents outlining the agreed payments to be made to clinical study sites. This budgeting process is crucial as it provides a framework for payments throughout the study's duration.

**What is the main focus of Greenphire Commercial Operations, and how is it structured?**
* Greenphire Commercial Operations is structured into teams that focus on partnerships with Contract Research Organizations (CROs), large pharmaceutical companies, small and medium-sized pharma and biotech companies (SMBs), and research sites or institutions. They also deal with participant reimbursement and travel.

**What was the role of the CRO Partner Manager at Greenphire?**
* The CRO Partner Manager was responsible for managing partnerships with Contract Research Organizations (CROs), which act as intermediaries to help integrate Greenphire's solutions into clinical study processes.

**How does Greenphire's revenue distribution between CROs and direct sponsor sales?**
* Approximately less than half of Greenphire's business is sold through CROs. The majority of their revenue comes from direct sales to sponsor companies, with a focus on large pharmaceutical companies.

**What are some common complaints or weaknesses associated with Greenphire's product?**
* Some common complaints include the perception that Greenphire's technology has not kept up with modern solutions and that it lacks flexibility. However, others argue that the complexity of clinical trial operations requires a deeper understanding, and newer vendors might not offer the same level of expertise.

**Has the sale to Thoma Bravo resulted in significant changes or challenges for Greenphire?**
* The sale to Thoma Bravo did not bring significant negative changes to Greenphire, although there was some internal perception that Thoma Bravo may have overpaid for the company. Turnover was more related to the operational workload and the way the company was run.

**Why did the interviewee leave Greenphire?**
* The interviewee left Greenphire because their role shifted from selling newer solutions to managing ongoing business operations, which was not aligned with their professional goals.

**How does Greenphire assess the magnitude of the threat posed by smaller competitors like Mural Health and Skout Clinical?**
* Greenphire highlights the importance of its global reach and ability to manage payments across regions as a differentiating factor. They argue that smaller competitors may not have the capacity to handle larger, more complex global studies.
* What factors are contributing to a potential decline in the number of clinical studies?
* Factors contributing to a potential decline in clinical studies include economic conditions, the identification of drugs with price negotiation potential, layoffs in biotech companies, and changes in funding availability.

**NPS:**
* Participant sentiment regarding Greenphire's solutions is generally positive, with over 90% satisfaction for participant reimbursement. (9/10)

### (Former Competitor Employee) Wayne Baker – Greenphire, Former Chief Commercial Officer
**Key Takeaways:**
* Greenphire is a company that provides solutions to manage and automate workflows for clinical research. They focus on two main areas: participant convenience and site or investigator support.
* Participant convenience includes compensating participants for their time and inconvenience, along with concierge services like travel arrangements and medical visas, all automated through their software platform.
* On the site or investigator side, Greenphire helps determine fair compensation rates for procedures and visits, streamlining the payment process for clinical trial sites.
* Greenphire is an industry leader in making payments for clinical trials, with many competitors in the space, although most of them handle smaller volumes and fewer transaction types.
* The major stakeholders in the clinical trial process include sponsors, contract research organizations (CROs), participants, and clinical operations staff. The use of technology often requires approval from various departments, including clinical operations and technology, and sometimes CROs are hired to help with clinical trial execution.
* Investigator sites vary in size and can range from small medical practices to large hospitals and universities. They can be contracted directly by sponsors or CROs or license solutions from companies like Greenphire.
* Greenphire offers two primary categories of solutions: participant convenience solutions, including ClinCard and ConnEx, and solutions for site payment management like eClinicalGPS and InvisiX.
* The split between ClinCard and ConnEx and the site payment solutions varies, with ClinCard being the older and more established product.
* Customer sentiment for Greenphire's clinical trial payments product is generally positive, with high satisfaction scores in the market. Complaints are typically isolated incidents and often related to external factors like funding delays.

### Shaun Williams, Sr. Director, CTP Strategic Offerings IQVIA
**Full Notes:**
**Your role at IQVIA?**
* Brought in a year ago and asked to establish participant services in regard to participant payments and travel and IQVIA where they have a few partners
* We have a few vendors that are used and there's not real methodology to it, but we spent a lot of money on these vendors; but that's not even most prevalent way we approach those services
* I was asked to look at the landscape at IQVIA and what the current state is for these services and what I know about it from the industry
* Then make a proposal about our best path forward
* IQVIA has a mixed bag of how these are provided: sometimes we outsource to third party vendors, or ask the sites and sponsors to build participant payments to include reimbursement into the site budget (CTA, clinical trial agreement)then sites invoice us and we pay sites and sites responsible for paying that; lastly, sponsors themselves sometimes say we've got a relationship with a vendor or we have something and take that off IQVIA's place so CRO isn't even contracted

**What is the split?**
* Sponsors hold R&D budget and decide how much if any of that budget they'll go outside and contract with a CRO, and I'm talking about big outsourcing
* So, for example, called full-service studies, if a sponsor is choosing for a particular study or entire portfolio to outsource everything; so that's full-service outsourcing and sponsor has a product and therapy or device they want help on completing; they can outsource it all to one or multipel CROs or pick and choose which services (i.e., participant services)
* Full-service outsourced? Not going to venture guess on this outsourcing studies, but a lot of data showing us being the biggest player as IQVIA in the industry now, EuroFins sits at number two at $7.5B and one falling like a rock is Sineas Health, my former employer

**Participant services outsourced?**
* If you add IQVIAs revenue and everyone from two on down
* I'm guessing you're around $100B total outsourcing; if you look at just pharma alone for total R&D budgets are 3x that amount or more than that

**How do stakeholders?**
* Landscape is changing with who is the decision maker with each service
* For the past several years, I'll say 5-10 years, industry has been more outsourced focused from a sponsor perspective
* Total outsource spend is going down, sponsors are outsourcing is decreasing, which in turn means standing up their own sources within sponsors, which is interesting
* Sponsors make more decisions on where they and who provides the various services: everything from medical writing, negotiating contracts, recruiting participants, ePro, eConsent
* If sponsor outsources full study, CRO is deciding group, which is spelled out in contract
* I think that's changing
* Greenphire has 10% market share because interesting dynamic with them and CROs that perform these services as well; seems like CROs have boxed them out of a good portion of the market; is that true and what is the actual relationship with Greenphire and CROS?
    * A little like co-opetition
    * I've got to be careful here
    * My previous employer, the same scenario holds true in other places
    * Greenphire started out as a provider a participant specific services then added site payments as an additional service they offered
    * At Sineos(?) health had a strong offering for site payments, but didn't have a strong offering for participant payments; with Greenphire being 10% (may be a little low, but not much more than that; they are still the market leader, a lot of small players out there); in the case of Sineos(?), G offered participant services; but then they'd compete on the site payments; so CRO like Sineos would look at it and say, why are we paying G tens of millions to provide participant services, yet they're going in and responding to RFPs trying to cut us out of the site payments work; that's not a good model in my opinion
    * Most CROs have site payments capability, some better than others, but they have it; and that scenario plays itself out every place they go
    * In G's case, may make sense to have two separate business: one focused on participant stuff
    * Then there's a whole other stuff, the relationship between sponsor and G; this is something I've been hearing a long time is that sponsors are not happy with what they're getting from G; multi-faceted: cost, service, reliability, and global capabilities
    * Oftentimes, they're put in situation dealing with CROs where they're the preferred supplier for participant services, so they say they've got it and have to use them, but aren't really happy with them
    * I've seen sites, even if the CRO decides to use G for one of these services; sites will make a decision or refuse to sign their contract because they don't want to work with G, which is a really crazy situation; but if sites won't use who we recommend, they won't sign the contract

**Do CROs also provide participant payments similar to site payments?**
* Has not been the case
* I know a lot of people at a lot of CROs and that was part of what I had been asking our market insights as well, not really prevalent, even for the larger CROs; other than a hybrid type solution which is, we have a process to pay the sites, so we can just have the sites do that (so more lump sum where they'd do lump sum payments that way; sites don't want it, it's a crap hand they're dealt, since they're put in situation to hire additional staff to manage that since it's such a labor intensive process)

**Who else is providing participant payments outside of G?**
* A lot of relatively small companies
* G isn't that big, they're well-funded
* There are a lot of other players out there
* But there are some companies like BBK Worldwide, mdgroup, Paragon(?) or Aragon(?) -- they aren't exclusively participant payments, they are actually doing much more than just this, but they have this as one of their offerings; they aren't a CRO, they are a service provider to the industry, whether selling direct to sponsors or CROS
* So G is probably the biggest exclusive provider of site and participant services
* But just participant side of it, there is some of the ones I mentioned
* ClinOne is another one, ClinCierge (only participant travel)
* These are all small, emerging technology companies
* So really fragmented from standpoint of so many offering technology solution only and services is a huge other component of this when dealing with hundreds of thousands to millions of participants, you need the backbone of services to pull this off
* While it's cool so many are looking at providing a tech solution, this must be paired with the services side of delivering support and all that

**MH strategy, thoughts?**
* They've got a good strategy
* selling well to sponsors
* We've talked a lot to them and spent time looking at what they offer
* IQVIA has continued to evaluate these
* Sam's background and people he's brought with them, they understand things they may want to do differently and not repeat mistakes of the past
* Personality of Sam, a lot of talk about being a disruptor and I think they're onto something there
* They have a leg up on others starting / breaking into the space
* From a development standpoint, there is tech and services and they appear to have a good roadmap there; some of it takes time

**Will MH run into that co-opetition dynamic?**
* Depends on how they form relationships with CROS
* I don't think they'll run into the problem, they have no intention of going into the site payments, so they'd avoid that problem that Greenphire has
* I don't know if you're familiar with Veeva, they asked me to spec out their site payments offering, which I understnd is not fully availalbe yet; they tried to offer everything a CRO could possibly want and they will also compete against the customer
* I don't think MH has that and knows that isn't healthy for their future growth

**What's interesting to us is we're confident Sam and Jason can do G 2.0 can build a good business, but takes awhile to sell on a study by study basis; however, if you form a partnership and white label and get a large book of studies with CROs and make those attractive, you could see the growth get exponential as opposed to linear, is that an opportunity?**
* I don't think white labeling the solution would remove
* To me, it makes sense on participant services, coming in with technology solution you could do site payments but brand as your own; may remove some of that concern
* My shoot from hip is focused on participant services; don't know if that model would be the best, even if offering right capability; could run into it at some level
* Hard to productize site payments
* Sponsors and CROs have figured it out; site payments are different study to study, the amount that you're paying, the contracted value; but general process can be generally consistent
* CROs have figured it out to a point where standalone vendors in that space, most of them have been acquired at this point

**What's different about site vs participant payments?**
* If you talk to finance people like FP&A, they will tell you site payments is just accounts payable, which it's not -- but at super high level, you can see the parallels between the two since a B2B transaction
* So participant payments is more B2C
* So just pure volume, every study has a # of sites, let's say avg number is probably 50, maybe a bit lower when factoring in early stage research on every clinical trial in existence; that's the multiplier for site payments
* But each site is recruiting participants, could be 10 or 100, but it's a factor much higher than that of sites; so now the volume goes up dramatically with these
* It's more service oriented and B2C transactional rather than B2B transactional and that's the big difference

**On market timing: willingness to switch off of Greenphire, you mentioned sponsors are getting frustrated, we've heard mixed feedback at sponsor level: heard some similar to yours and then some are standardizing; so people hate at site and participants, but some sponsors may be insulated?**
* Traditionally, our market is risk averse
* They don't want to try something new since so much money involved and if you screw it up, you aren't just screwing up that, but impacting peoples' lives; so it's a heavily risk averse type of situation, which does not help when you're trying to innovate
* You have a glaring case study at hand, which is Pfizer's failed relationship with Greenphire; I had a lot of inside view on this at Sineos(?), where we were in a merge with a company that managed their site payments; I said G has to go, so we transitioned all of those over and Pfizer said we've decided to stick with them; so I went up to talk with them and they said decision already made and going forward it, but will let you keep the studies at Sineos(?)
    * So we transitioned G studies over to our core process, then Pfizer went all in with them; then three years later, they realized it was faling really fast
    * A lot of reasons and factors for that, but both at Sineos(?), I've had a lot of interest from sponsors, never 100% -- the old school like Merck, the bigger pharms that are going to want things just to be not disruptive to anything; so many the safe play is to go with the big player, which is G
    * But there are a lot interested in trying something new
    * Majority of sponsors will have an interest in finding a better way since it's not working for them
    * Certainly from the sites and participant side, they will give you an ear full

## Other - Industry Perspectives (Transaction Advisors, Consultants)
### (Greenphire Transaction) Hugh Hoffman – AGC, Partner
**Key Takeaways:**
* Main problem facing clinical trial providers is participant recruitment and retention with a contributing factor around how participants are paid
* Greenphire initially disrupted delayed participant payments done according to normal payment cycles via accounting systems: legacy ERP players like SAP and Oracle
* Greenphire sold to Thoma Bravo in Jul '23 at ~10.6x six-month forward ARR of $104M, 30% EBITDA
* Vendors entering the payments space often combine it with a different core solution
* New entrants may struggle with tax and accounting knowledge for payments and are likely to have greater success with smaller trials

**Full Notes:**
**Expert Background:**
* Hugh is a Partner at AGC Partners, focusing on HCIT, Life Sciences Technology and Software out of the firm's Minneapolis office. Hugh worked on the sales of Greenphire to Riverside and Thoma Bravo.

**Greenphire Background:**
* The overarching problem that clinical trial providers face is participant recruitment and retention. One contributing factor is how participants are paid. Before Greenphire, clinical trial participants were paid according to pharmaceutical companies' normal payment cycles, and via their accounting systems (legacy ERP such as SAP and Oracle). For participants, that could mean waiting 3-4 months to receive payment.
* Greenphire hypothesized that immediate payment would increase participant retention and solve logistical problems at clinical trial sites. Greenphire launched this solution with clinical trial sites and eventually expanded to larger trials, winning deals with IQVIA and the like.
* Greenphire grew from $10M [ARR?] [when sold to Riverside?] to $100M [ARR?] at exit over a 5-6 year period.
* Greenphire has become the dominant player in the space. Hugh has seen other players try to take market share without much success. Often these vendors have a different primary offering with payments as a secondary piece.

**Sale to Thoma Bravo:**
* Closed in July 2021
* Sold for ~10x 6-month forward ARR of $104M
* 30% EBITDA

**Is it possible to disrupt Greenphire in this market and, if so, is now the time?**
* Vendors who enter the payment space combine it with a different core solution.
* Mural Health seems unique in that it is providing real-time feedback to help identify [participants] at risk of churn and resolve those issues. Greenphire did well with its early prediction capabilities (e.g., flagging if a site did not complete payment via the product).

**Is Greenphire's reliance on fees a weak spot?**
* (Background: Our hypothesis is that Greenphire relies on fees to add $10Bn EBITDA. A no-fee product would create a difficult product decision for Thoma and Greenphire).
* This resonates, but if there is a way to reduce the fees, a startup still needs to break in with CROs. [Usually CROs have termed vendors, so they already have a vendor installed even when switching between sites?].
* Another benefit of Greenphire is the tax know-how and back-end accounting for global taxes. This might affect a new entrant's success.
* New entrants might have luck with smaller trials or meaningful new drugs.

**Would a partnership angle with stakeholders affect the challenge breaking in with CROS?**
* Trials are brand-focused and are heavily reliant on companies' relationships with brand managers at pharmaceutical companies.
* Greenphire was able to accelerate traction by bypassing brands and going straight to enterprises like IQVIA.

**What's your read on Sam Whitaker? (MAYBE REDACT?)**
* Thinks very highly of Sam.
* He never wanted to be the CEO of a large company; Sam is best at product development and product management.

**What is your experience with Mural Health?**
* No personal experience or demo of Mural Health.
* Mural Health is seen as an innovative solution for modernizing patient payments and engagement.
* Two-way communication with research sites is seen as a brilliant feature, especially given the challenges of phone calls and personal phone numbers.

**How is the software selected for a site in the first place?**
* The choice of software depends on the size of the company.
* Larger sponsors may have preferred vendors.
* Smaller pharmaceutical companies often rely on recommendations from Contract Research Organizations (CROs).
* Some companies may select a vendor, and CROs then contract with them.

**How does Mural Health fit into the picture?**
* Mural Health's focus on improving the patient experience and reducing the burden on sites can make it appealing to sponsors.
* Sponsors moving away from CROs and wanting to manage vendor relationships themselves find value in such solutions.
* Smaller companies may be attracted to Mural's pricing model.

**What percentage of trials are outsourced from sponsor to CRO?**
* Approximately 95% of clinical trials involve some form of a CRO.
* In the early days, Greenphire attempted to offer its services for free to sites, relying on sites to recommend the software to sponsors.

**What is the ROI with Greenphire?**
* Patient compensation is essential due to participants having multiple jobs and living paycheck to paycheck.
* Greenphire's concept of timely payments has become a standard offering for clinical trials.
* Mural has an opportunity to offer a superior solution compared to existing options.

**How is traditional participant retention managed in trials?**
* Participant retention varies by indication and study, with an average dropout rate of 20-30% over time.
* For some studies, protocol adjustments may be needed to address high churn rates.

**What is the spend per patient in clinical trials?**
* The cost per patient depends on various factors, such as the indication.
* Costs can range from around $50,000 on the low end to over $150,000 for certain rare diseases.

**What are the current challenges in patient recruitment?**
* Challenges include finding patients and using AI technologies compliantly.
* Resourcing at research sites is a challenge, given the lack of staff.
* Two-way text communication is crucial for patient engagement.
* Site engagement is seen as critical to becoming the sponsor and CRO of choice for research sites.

**What is the communication gap between sponsors and CROs?**
* CROs often act as intermediaries between sponsors and research sites.
* The fear of upsetting sponsors and sites can hinder effective communication.

**How many studies are CRO coordinators actively running?**
* CRO coordinators are often involved in multiple studies simultaneously, ranging from 3 to potentially 25 or more.
* Communication challenges arise due to these high workloads.

**Are sponsors incentivized to have drug delivery as fast as possible?**
* The primary incentive for sponsors is to obtain high-quality data that demonstrates the efficacy of their drug.
* Early compassionate use programs may be aimed at seeding the market with patients on their drugs.

**What is it like reconciling payments in clinical trials?**
* The process and level of detail in reconciling payments can vary.
* There is a need to inquire with Clinical Operations (ClinOps) study managers for specific information.

**How do preferred vendors work in clinical trials?**
* Sponsors may typically work with 2-3 preferred vendors for patient payments.

**Is it realistic for Mural to become a preferred vendor?**
* It is seen as realistic, particularly if Mural offers solutions that alleviate the burden on research sites.
* Smaller and mid-sized sponsors may find Mural's pricing and features appealing.

**What is the understanding of pricing for Greenphire?**

* The importance of involving the community and focus groups in the design of research studies is emphasized.
* Feedback from participants reveals that they prefer not to be compensated with gift cards, as it may be seen as an insult. The choice of words like "reimbursement" is noted to have implications, as it can affect public housing or public rent.
* The decision to use ClinCard can involve multiple parties, including the sponsor, the site, and the trial setup.
* Fraud issues can arise in ClinCard use, necessitating quality checks to ensure accuracy and compliance. Participants have expressed concerns about ClinCard fees, leading to a reevaluation of the system's shortcomings.
* A new system called Mural Health is mentioned, which seems to have strong quality reporting, 1099 reporting options, and focus on tax and tax reporting.
* Johanna acknowledges that there is a market need for a solution that aligns with the feedback and needs of focus groups and patients.
* The impact and success criteria of a new system would be driven by satisfaction and meeting compliance needs, taking into account leadership's priorities and individual grant-level metrics.
* Budgeting for trials is typically done at the trial level, based on informed consent and schedules of events.

**Full Notes:**
**Expert Background:**
* Johanna has over 20 years of experience in the field, starting as a research assistant and progressing to a compliance officer.
* Johanna currently works in clinical research at BMC (likely Boston Medical Center).
* Johanna's team at the clinical trial office is responsible for supporting three systems: Velo (corporate travel), ClinCard (owned by ClinCard), and EPIC (an EMR system), particularly concerning billing and compliance.
* Johanna has experience working as a compliance officer in Utah to design a clinical trial management system through a company called Huron.
* BMC serves a population where over 50% are at or below the poverty line, 70% are people of color with public insurance, and a third speak a primary language other than English. It is a safety net hospital with a significant ER, and it serves a diverse and underserved community.
* Johanna emphasizes that BMC has a unique community perspective compared to larger academic medical centers like Mass General or Brigham. This perspective is rooted in the voices of the community they serve.
* In partnerships, other organizations seek out BMC for this community-based perspective when working on research and healthcare initiatives.

**How does Johanna view the role of software solutions in addressing clinical trial challenges involving underserved populations?**
* Johanna is skeptical of software solutions, emphasizing that there are many operational decision-making gaps that need to be considered.

**What is the primary focus of addressing inclusion science in clinical trials?**
* The primary goal is to ensure that research is conducted on all populations rather than solely focusing on studying white participants. This necessitates community and focus group involvement in the design process.

**What does the CEAL Award (Community Engaged Alliance) entail?**
* The CEAL Award, with an annual budget of $1 million, concentrates on "participant reform." It involves studying how participants are reimbursed and how they prefer to be reimbursed, particularly focusing on the value of their time.

**Why is the term "reimbursement" considered problematic, and what alternative term is suggested?**
* The term "reimbursement" may have negative consequences, especially for individuals in public housing. The speaker recommends using the term "stipend" to avoid potential issues.

**What challenges are associated with using gift cards or ClinCard for compensation in clinical trials?**
* Participants often find gift cards as compensation insulting, which can discourage enrollment. The speaker mentions that operational decisions made solely through software are not a suitable solution.

**Who makes decisions regarding the use of ClinCard in clinical trials, and how does it vary?**
* The decision to use ClinCard involves multiple parties, including sponsors, sites, and the trial setup. It can vary between trials and organizations.

**How are fraud issues addressed in the use of ClinCard, and what advantages are highlighted?**
* Fraud issues are addressed through quality checks in the ClinCard system, which offers the advantage of ensuring accuracy and compliance. However, these checks are seen as more beneficial to institutions rather than participants.

**What concerns have been raised about ClinCard fees?**
* Participants have expressed concerns about ClinCard fees, leading to questions about the system's overall suitability and cost-effectiveness.

**How is the impact and success of a new system in clinical trials quantified?**
* Success is quantified through participant satisfaction and the system's ability to meet compliance needs while aligning with the institution's priorities.

**Is budgeting for clinical trials typically done at the trial level or participant level?**
* Budgeting for clinical trials is typically done at the trial level, taking informed consent and schedules of events into account to ensure fair and equal treatment of all participants.

### (Mural Health Consultant) Kevin O'Nell – Independent Consultant
**Key Takeaways:**
* Historically, Greenphire partnered with a number of Tier 3 and Tier 4 banks
* Mural Health intentionally sought to partner with Tier 1 banks out of the gate, which is typically difficult for startups to do (leveraged Kevin's relationships to break-in)
* Believes Mural Health partnered with Tier 1 JPMorgan Chase
* Partnerships with larger banks help them build a framework for international payments ahead of time so they can scale globally and have one portal that handles all reimbursement and payments with as little friction as possible, regardless of the participant's preferred form (prepaid card, Venmo, etc.)
* Nothing technically prevents Greenphire from replicating Mural Health's work with JPMorgan Chase, but may companies struggle to figure out payments
* Greenphire has a certain amount of revenue from “breakage,” the unspent funds on prepaid cards. With real-time payments, breakage is essentially zero. This would require Greenphire to invest in product development and would require them to erode their own breakage revenue for some period.
* For Greenphire, fees are charged for other types of transactions like: withdrawing money from an ATM, requesting a check, breakage (unspent funds), interchange fees of 2-2.5% for transactions at point of sale – ACH payments would eliminate these revenue streams and incur a cost

**Full Notes:**
**Expert Background:**
* Kevin is currently a Senior VP of Growth at LegalSifter and was previously a Senior VP of Partnerships & Payments at MarinEdge for two and a half years. He has interacted with Mural Health as an independent consultant focused on banking partnerships.
* Kevin has spent the last two decades in the payments space at large banks (Citi, KeyBank, Capital One), startups, and on the investment side.
* Kevin originally met Sam Whitaker at Ecount, which they sold to Citibank. While at KeyBank, Kevin looked into a partnership with Greenphire, which was never formally established.

**What problem did Mural Health come to you with?**
* Greenphire had partnered with a number of Tier 3 and Tier 4 banks. Mural Health was looking to partner with Tier 1 banks out of the gate, which is typically difficult for startups to do. They were looking to use Kevin's relationships to break in.

**Why was it important for them to partner with a Tier 1 bank, as opposed to the partnerships that Greenphire took?**
* Some sub-Tier 1 banks do not have the same compliance expertise, as we've seen in cases like Silicon Valley Bank. Given they are in the healthcare industry, it's important to have proper compliance guidance as soon as possible.
* Partnerships with larger banks help them build a framework for international payments ahead of time so they can scale globally. This has not played out for them yet.

**Did Mural Health partner with a Tier 1 bank?**
* Kevin is pretty sure Mural Health partnered with JP Morgan or another Tier 1 bank. However, he hasn't followed the company closely since consulting with them.

**What are they relying on that partnership for, specifically?**
* Differentiating from other vendors by allowing participants to get their payments efficiently.
* The industry went from checks to prepaid cards, and now it is moving towards payments to retain participants.
* The idea is to have one portal that handles all reimbursement and payments with as little friction as possible, regardless of the participant's preferred form (prepaid card, Venmo, etc.).
* From a regulatory and connectivity perspective, JP Morgan would give them an ability to provide prepaid cards, or handle ACH payments, Zelle, or Venmo. It's not as simple from a tech perspective, but JP Morgan would open doors for them that would get them there.

**Is there anything stopping Greenphire from replicating Mural Health's work with JP Morgan?**
* Technically nothing, but a lot of companies struggle to figure out payments.
* For example, in the restaurant industry, why doesn't Toast replicate what MarginEdge is doing? Sometimes companies on the collections or merchant processing side of payments don't understand what to do on the treasury side of payments.

**Why do you think that is?**
* Companies need to build the right infrastructure and understand the timing of payments and how to account for payment flow.
* There's also a regulatory piece. This is difficult with payments alone, but the healthcare sector and interactions with trial participants add two additional layers of complexity. These are barriers of entry to “getting it right.”

**How difficult would it be for Greenphire to develop the same payment offerings?**
* They have probably partnered with a Tier 1 bank and developed this, but Kevin is not sure. He hasn't spoken to them since 2019.

**Of the features that Mural Health is working on with JP Morgan, which are low hanging fruit for competitors to go after, and which are more difficult to achieve?**
* The longstanding payment rails are low hanging fruit: ACH, prepaid cards. Checks are getting a little harder and banks are trying to move away from checks.
* Integrating with Zelle and Venmo is harder. Consumer demand is there, but banks have not done a ton of B2C real-time payment integrations yet.
* Things like Apple/Google wallet are even less developed. This would be difficult.

**Does Greenphire want to replicate what Mural Health is doing? Is there defensible in Mural Health's business strategy/banking partnership?**
* Skeptical of defensibility outside of pure execution.
* In short, could they? Yes. Would they? That's uncertain.
* The main potential barrier is payment monetization. Greenphire has a certain amount of revenue from "breakage,” the unspent funds on prepaid cards. With real-time payments, breakage is essentially zero. This would require Greenphire to invest in product development and would require them to erode their own breakage revenue for some period.

**How does Greenphire monetize prepaid cards?**
* Fees: While transactions at the point of sale are free, fees are charged for other types of transactions like withdrawing money from an ATM or requesting a check.
* Breakage (unspent funds): Any unspent money on the card eventually becomes revenue for Greenphire, per state laws.
* Interchange fees of 2-2.5% for transactions at the point of sale.
* ACH payments would eliminate these revenue streams and incur a cost.

**How do these fees get absorbed in the supply chain of the transaction? Does the end customer notice these fees when using the card?**
* Speed and convenience of payments modifies customer behavior more than the fees. Customers expect near-instant direct deposits now.

**Is there anything else we should be asking to understand why Mural Health's approach versus Greenphire's approach is meaningful?**
* At a high level, payment is a necessary part of the business, but customers measure success by end-user engagement and retention in clinical trials.

**What is the disparity between Greenphire and Mural Health in terms of usage?**
* The majority of usage falls under Greenphire, but some users rely on gift cards, homegrown solutions, or non-purpose-built resources. About 60% of patient payments are processed through Greenphire, while 35% use homegrown or horizontal solutions.

**How do you handle preferred vendors at different sites?**
* Many sites have worked with Greenphire but don't see it as their dedicated choice.
* There is more flexibility in patient payments, but most commonly used options are widely accepted.

**Why is there more willingness to change on the participant side rather than the site side?**
* Mural Health, although perceived as slightly more expensive, offers more value.
* Greenphire focuses on debit card solutions, but they come with hidden fees that can affect patients, sponsors, and sites. Mural Health provides more inclusive options like mobile payments and flexibility, making it more suitable for growth.

**What is the spending structure for Mural Health?**

**When did you first hear about Mural Health?**
* The individual had prior knowledge of Mural Health through their connections, and they were introduced to the idea when they were in a position to make purchases.

**What are the limitations of Greenphire?**
* Greenphire lacks mobile payment options and has hidden fees that patients might not be aware of. There is also a lack of education on how to use the product, and failure to use funds on the card within a certain time frame can result in additional charges. Mural Health aims to provide zero patient fees, greater flexibility, transportation, and concierge services.

**How is the return on investment (ROI) viewed in this context?**
* The ROI for patient retention and creating inclusive experiences is a challenging aspect.
* The speaker questions whether offering multiple models for patient payments can excite pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer. There's an emphasis on considering diversity and inclusion in the context of mobile payment options.

**How is patient retention addressed?**
* Patient retention is critical, and if you initially enroll 100 patients, you might see dropouts due to factors like the drug's effectiveness or side effects. A significant portion also drops out due to time commitments or reluctance to disclose illness. The speaker suggests that Mural Health could potentially demonstrate a compelling ROI on retention, but it's a challenging task.

**Does Mural Health offer reporting analytics on sites, patients, and retention?**
* Mural Health aims to provide reporting analytics, but their value depends on whether these analytics are predictive rather than descriptive. Predictive analytics are considered valuable but challenging to implement. It will likely be disease and trial type-specific and may take about a year to develop. Accurate data is essential when reporting to the scientific community.

**How can this tech integration become a big business?**
* The tech industry is tired of disparate solutions. Creating a friendly and open integration ecosystem that allows different tech providers to work together is seen as an interesting way to grow beyond existing players like Greenphire. The speaker believes that
* integrating with other quality providers could be a key to success. Open tech integration and partnership strategies are considered advantageous.

**Do you see open tech integration and a go-to-market (GTM) partnership strategy as a competitive advantage?**
* Open tech integration and GTM partnership strategies can be competitive advantages. It's compared to companies like HubSpot and Slack that can integrate and work together. Smaller, more modern companies like Mural Health are seen as faster in integrating with other technologies compared to larger players like Greenphire.
