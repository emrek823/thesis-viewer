# Tennr - Manager at BetterNight
## Interview conducted on October 28, 2025

### Topics
Patient Intake, AI Tools, AI Solutions, Medical Coding, Patient Chart, Outsourcing, Document Qualification, Healthcare AI

### Summary
A Technical Program Manager from BetterNight engaged in a conversation with the Tegus Client, discussing the importance of AI tools in streamlining patient intake and prior authorization workflows in the U.S. healthcare space. The expert emphasized the need for a combination of in-house and outsourced tasks to ensure compliance and operational effectiveness, focusing on enhancing existing AI solutions rather than adding new ones. They highlighted the challenges and benefits of various AI tools, such as Tennr, Cohere, Darby, and Coral, in improving efficiency and accuracy in medical coding and patient information management, underscoring the ongoing evolution and potential of AI solutions in healthcare.

### Expert Details
Manager at BetterNight, a current customer of Tennr, and a recent evaluator of Synthpop in January and February of this year.

Expert was a part of the evaluation team for evaluating and implementing Tennr and is working on those integrations daily. Expert can speak to Tennr's products, use cases, evaluation criteria used, and its integrations on an enterprise level. Expert can also speak extensively about the evaluation criteria for Synthpop, its products, and why they did not select the solution.

Manager at BetterNight. The expert is responsible for leading technical operations focused on building scalable, AI-powered automation solutions across healthcare workflows. The expert specialized in bridging the gap between human processes and machine efficiency such as developing bots, API integrations, and document automation pipelines that cut down manual labor and accelerate outcomes.

The expert can speak to technology integrations, information technology (IT) digital transformation, programming, back-end web development, machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI), test automation, Tennr, Twilio Flex, SendGrid, Python, Brightree, DocuSign, Short.io, Unbounce, and Jenkins.

**Q: What are the key steps in the patient intake workflow? How is it currently done?**
A: The key steps are receiving referrals and documents from providers or patients, qualifying the documents, checking insurance, getting patient financial responsibility. In parallel the scheduling team is working on appointment scheduling, communication with the patient, and coding services

**Q: What is the biggest bottleneck in patient intake? Have you tried RPA or AI solutions to streamline this process?**
A: We have tennr ai. We have used synthpop and I have written several RPAs for my company using ai solutions to streamline the best practices for each part of the flow

**Q: Which RPA/AI vendor do you currently work with (i.e., Silna Health, Tennr, Coral AI, Spry, etc)? Why?**
A: Silna is an insurance and pre-auth instance that didn't work as well as what we currently have with apis and stedi. Coral is only a tool not a full solution. Tennr is a working solution. We are a dme company spry

does not apply to us

I was a part of the evaluation team for both.

We use Brightree and Tennr which break up the tasks for our admins, classifies documents, and automations, creating the Brighttree portal. It takes them through the entire customer roadmap and more. I am working on Tennr integrations almost every day.

**Q: What other vendors did you evaluate alongside the above vendor that you work with?**
A: Darby, synthpop, xyai, twilio segment, and many other piecemeal solutions.

**Client**
Maybe I can set some quick context for this call. We're trying to build a point of view on the U.S. healthcare space in general, but very specifically on the patient intake and prior auth workflow. We have broadly two, three key questions we just love to get your thoughts on. The first is, probably we're not experts in this space, so we would love to get a one-on-one on what the entire patient intake workflow looks like, what are the key steps, how do different sizes of health systems actually go about doing it, so on and so forth.

Second is we'd love to appreciate from you the various tools available in the market for this. I know you've mentioned in your screening responses about Tennr, Coral, etc., and Silna. We'd love to appreciate from you what each of these tools do and how does it compare. Finally, maybe I'd just love to get your sense of some go-to-market in this space, how are these tools doing, etc. That's the broad agenda. Is that something you're okay with?

**Expert**
Absolutely.

**Client**
Awesome. Maybe to get things started, would be really helpful to get a quick rundown of your current role and how you go about evaluating these or why you were involved in the prior auth workflow.

**Expert**
Yes. I am actually the only site engineer left for my company, BetterNight. My current title is Technical Program Manager. I also act as the assistant director of development. My job is to not only work with our overseas team on creating tools to help with the patient process, but also, I'm generally tasked with evaluating any tools that we might purchase to help stateside admins be more efficient. That generally includes things like Tennr, Synthpop, Mandolin.

There's a company called Cohere. There's a few big pain points in the healthcare space, and I think it's probably universal no matter where you're looking at. The prior auth and the patient intake are both very large painful jobs for admins. It's a largely manual process that we really do try to make as simple as possible, so that it can be condensed into something that AI can infer.

**Client**
That's super useful context. Maybe it would be really helpful as well if you could just double-click a little bit on what your company, BetterNight, actually does and why you guys actually need to go about with the practice in your firm.

**Expert**
We're an end-to-end sleep apnea provider, which means we go through the process of taking in patients, providing a consult, providing a home sleep test. If that home sleep test turns out to have sleep apnea, we issue a PAP machine. We also will supply that PAP machine with the nondurable supplies that they will need

monthly.

In addition to that though, our biggest revenue provider is actually the CPAP referrals, which means that we get a lot of referrals from a lot of different doctors all over the United States, and they all look different. It's a big job to take in all this documentation, qualify it appropriately, create the patient start, and then get to work on the prior auth, which is a nightmare no matter how you slice it.

**Client**
I think that's helpful context. Would be really helpful if you could just dive a little bit into what that prior auth or patient intake workflow looks like. What are the key steps? Why is it so manual and painful?

**Expert**
Before we started adding our AI tools, there's a few things you have to do. One is you have to get the patient's information so you can contact the patient. Faxing is still the king in the healthcare space, which means that we'll just be receiving faxes 24 hours a day from referral sources all over the United States. While we do provide them with referral forms to use, many times they don't use them.

They might have their own referral form, and they might just fax us the entire patient chart. For a manual person who's getting a fax, let's say they get a fax that's 18 pages, they have to go through that 18 pages, find the pertinent information just to be able to create the patient chart. In some cases, it might be missing things. We might not have even a contact information for that patient.

We actually have to send that back to our missing info team to fax the doctor back and say, "Look, we don't have any way of contacting this patient to let them know we received a referral." There's a lot of eyes that need to be on it. That's where we started to employ AI to help us find the needle in the haystack.

Some of the stuff is handwritten. It's not handwritten very clearly. A lot of the AI tools that we use will employ something like a textract and a scraping algorithm to try to at least suggest to us which fields they think with certainty are the fields we need to create the patient chart. Did that answer your question?

**Client**
The workflow is you're getting faxed patient information, and there's a lot of gaps there which you need to fill. What happens post that? If you could just walk us step-by-step through the entire process. Let's say you receive that fax now. How do you act on it? How do you check about eligibility and stuff?

**Expert**
Let's assume that the fax that we've received has everything we need in it. If that's the case, then a patient chart is created in our EHR, which happens to be Brightree. Many other EHRs exist like Epic and things like that if you're looking at just the generalized health space. At some point, now we have those documents we need to create the patient chart.

We need to start looking at the insurance to find out what was ordered if we can get reimbursed for it, so do we have the right documentation to go in and ask, say, Blue Cross Blue Shield for a pre-auth. That process depends on the insurance company. There's a lot of branching logic there.

If we're looking at Blue Cross Blue Shield, most of the Blue Cross Blue Shield still require a manual phone call to their Availity line to tell us if the policy that the patient has requires pre-auth for a home sleep test, for example, or a CPAP. Most of them do require auth. The manual team will go in, and they will submit the documents they need to the insurance company to start the process of obtaining authorization. At that point, once we've heard back from the insurance company that authorization has been approved, then we will contact the patient to set up the service.

**Client**
Makes complete sense. Is that entire process run by an in-house team, or do you guys work with outsourced vendors?

**Expert**
There's only so much we can do because we're dealing with PHI. We do have a few companies that we subcontract to handle some of the patient chart creation and the patient contact. The reason AI is such a big deal for us is because we're in healthcare, there's only so much that we can outsource overseas and still be compliant with HIPAA and being protective of patient health information.

**Client**
Makes sense. Just double-clicking here, is this entirely done by an in-house team and how large is that team today? What are your spends on salary, etc.? What portion of this can be outsourced, and what portion has to be maintained by you in-house just for you to be compliant?

**Expert**
I would say that a good 50% has to be in-house, just has to be. I'm using the 50% to say that it could probably be less than that. I think what you'll notice, when you look at all these different healthcare companies that you're probably researching, is that they all have very, very specific workflows and standard operating procedures that really do need someone who works in the company to be able to handle those.

I would say for every time a stateside person touches an account, there's probably another overseas person that's handling something else. It's a 50/50 blend right now. That being said, my AI tools have probably brought me from 40 admins on the stateside to maybe five. It's really sped up our workflow.

**Client**
Got it. Could you, just to bring this to life for us, give us an example of something that can be outsourced and something that can't?

**Expert**
Sure. A good example would be when a patient is prescribed a CPAP machine. At that point, we still have to work with the insurance company again. Now, the insurance company will only pay for a CPAP machine if the patient is using it.

They've entered what's called a compliance period. At that point, we use some outsourced people to help with that part of the situation. They might add notes to the patient account, add things like serial numbers, register their machines with external vendors, things like that. They also can and do often handle some of our phone calls on our inbound call line. They are able to answer the phones for us in certain cases, depending on where the call is transferred.

**Client**
That's helpful. What's an example of something that has to be in-house, and you can't outsource?

**Expert**
Most of our patient chart creation and our document qualification. When we get a new patient fax and we're looking at through all the documents to decide if we need to ask the doctor for more information, if we're ready to move forward with treatment, that is usually something that has to be done in-house. It's not necessarily needing to be done in-house because of HIPAA.

It needs to be done in-house because the failure rate of anyone who doesn't know our SOP would be higher. We don't want to send out a PAP machine and then find out the insurance isn't going to pay for it because someone who didn't know how to qualify the documents was working with document qualifier intake queue.

**Client**
Got it. Perhaps one follow-up from me on this. When you think about AI solutions, are you trying to reduce your dependence on outsourced vendors, or are you trying to reduce the workload on your in-house team? I'm sure it's a combination of both, but what's your priority?

**Expert**
I'm going to give you my view on this as far as just knowing and including all of these AI tools. I am at a point now, and I think that it's probably very common as an AI engineer, that I don't want to add any other AI products from healthcare into our current workflow. Ones that are there are there, and they can stay, but at this point, I think that the focus now, 100%, has to be on making what we have do a better job. The AIs are only as good as their large language models. They're only as good as their inferring capabilities. They need to be trained.

I think that one thing that we're really missing in the healthcare space right now is that we have a lot of C-suite level executives who are looking, from their point, they want to reduce manual tasks. They want to cut those FTEs. They want to make things cheaper. They're looking for AI to do that.

I don't think you would talk to anybody, at my level in the engineering, that would tell you that we can cut any more FTEs at this point until the AI starts behaving a little bit better. It's not any one company's fault. It's just these models need time to learn. They need time to evolve. They're babies.

**Client**
Got it. Let's say you're working at another health system tomorrow, and that's a health system that's still early on its AI journey. It hasn't procured any of these systems. As you think about onboarding AI systems into that new health system that you're working at, would you prioritize reducing your dependence on outsourcing, or would you prioritize getting in tools that automate your in-house workflow so that you don't need as many FTEs?

**Expert**
I think this is unique to my company. I think that you're going to get different answers other places. For my company specifically, there are no more FTEs to cut, I think, at this point. I shudder to even think what we could get rid of anymore because even our admins that are doing intake queues are also answering the phones. We have used AI to the point where, unless an AI solution can start answering the phone reliably for us, there's nothing else to cut. I can't prioritize that.

What I can prioritize is using AI, or in most cases just heavily scripted programming and automation to try to make the people's, who are still there, jobs easier and more accurate. Instead of reducing FTE, maybe maximizing the output we're getting out of the FTE we currently have.

**Client**
Makes sense. If I may just jump back in, just curious, how large is your in-house team which takes care of the patient intake or prior auth workflow today? That's after the cut?

**Expert**
We used to have upwards of 100 doing this. We have five now.

**Client**
Just to be clear, like all of that headcount, which is like the 95 odd people, have been laid off in the past couple of years, since AI?

**Expert**
Yes.

**Client**
Got it. Maybe we'd love to appreciate now, what are the different tools that you guys are using in your stack today with AI? Are you using one tool for all these processes, or is it like a bunch of point solutions struck together?

It's exactly the second thing. What you're going to find, and you probably already have in this AI space, and I've seen it when you guys send me screening questions, is you asked about experiences and comparing maybe three or four different solutions, none of those solutions do the same thing. There isn't a one-size-fits-all solution. If they say they do, they are.

Usually, what happens is they do one thing pretty okay and the other thing they do terribly. We have Tennr. I've evaluated Darby. We have Synthpop. I would like to see Synthpop go away. What you find is, just as an aside, once you introduce AI into a certain part of a workflow and you cut the FTEs that were handling that, you're pretty much stuck with them until you can find something else which also takes FTE.

It takes people to find a way to replace it. You become very, very reliant on it which is why I do think the AI healthcare space is a very profitable place to be in. For example, if you were looking to evaluate a product like Tennr, my company could not untangle themselves from Tennr if we tried at this point. It would be disastrous.

It's a very captive audience. I can definitely see, as people are joining these places, that these AI companies are going to be able to continually increase the ask and then continually increase the spend. Those healthcare facilities are going to have to pay it. Did that answer your question?

**Client**
The helpful context. Maybe just taking a step back. If you could just tell us, solution by solution, what are they exactly doing for you? For instance, you mentioned Tennr, which part of the workflow are they taking care for you, so on and so forth? Just to give some context to this question. They're actually facing the exact same problem that you've pointed, every solution outside in claims to do everything.

**Expert**
It does, and it doesn't do it well.

**Client**
Yeah. They're just struggling to figure out what do you actually use something for? What was their pitch? What actually worked? What's just a facade at this point? If you can just help us understand this landscape a bit better.

**Expert**
Sure. I am going to start by Tennr because that's the very first thing that touches our system with AI. I will tell you that at this point, I am not sure how much AI Tennr is actually using. I guarantee they have a large language model. I guarantee they're training it. What I am seeing, more than anything, is it's a heavily, heavily scripted Amazon Textract service.

This document qualification part, and they all do this, when you see an AI that says it's doing automated document qualifying, it's backed up to AWS which was not great last Monday, by the way. We start with Tennr. Tennr is going to start scraping those documents and trying to find the necessary fields that we need to create that patient chart. From there, it is going to run a UI script to create the patient chart in our healthcare record system. It's going to create a sales order.

If we got an order for, say, a home sleep test, it'll create that sales order. It'll put the sales order in a state where our team can look at it and find out where the next step is. If it's a cash pay sleep test, great, we're ready to move on. Usually, what happens is next it goes to insurance and benefits. This is a new tool that we have purchased, it's a standalone from Tennr.

This was a tool that Tennr promised when we started with them about a year and a half ago. It's still not right. It's a lot better than it was. They missed their deadline by almost a year. That was painful because their deadlines were used to determine how many people we were going to need in the insurance team. They were laid off before we had the solution in place. Once Tennr has the insurance, it uses what I think is their large language model to try to determine auth.

Basically, what they are doing is looking at all of the payers that they have processed before and find out if

that payer with that policy requires auth. They do have a big enough data set at that point to determine whether or not they need it, without necessarily making a call to the insurance company. From that point, I do believe they are able to submit auth in some cases. In most cases, what they will do is they will change that sales order to manual benefits review, and then our offshore team will start looking for the benefits to determine if the service is covered.

The next AI solution comes in next, which is Synthpop. This is not a solution. What it does is it actually makes a phone call to Blue Cross Blue Shield. It's a specific tool just to use for Blue Cross Blue Shield.

It's calling the Availity line and trying to talk to a representative to get permission for the authorization because there are certain policies that require a phone call. In theory, that would be fantastic. In practice, it has a 90% fail rate. Most of the time, it gets hung up on. We go back and forth with my C-suite. They're okay with this because we don't pay unless the call is successful.

I feel like it's failing so much, where we should just assume the call is not going to be successful and move on, instead of having it integrated into the system in any way. Pulling it out would cost engineering dollars. Last but not least, our last external AI solution is a company called MaskFit AR. When a patient is prescribed a CPAP machine, so they went through the HST, they've been prescribed a CPAP. It's time to pay for one.

There's a company we use that scans the face of the patient and helps us determine what mask would be most appropriate for the patient, measures their face, does a bunch of things with telemetry. What that's supposed to do is it's supposed to help us reduce the failure rate on the CPAP machines.

Patients reject CPAP machines at a very high rate, in general. If you can get the right mask on them, the chances of that go way down. That's where MaskFit AR comes into place. After that, every other AI solution is something I've built internally. The last one is called MaskFit AR. I think it's a cool company. I don't think there's any profit potential here because it is just so specific.

**Client**
That makes sense. Do you have an example of some system that you've perhaps built in-house, that's working phenomenally well, that you would have preferred there was an outsourced vendor that was building that?

**Expert**
Oh my gosh, yes. Doctor standardization. I'm going to talk slow here in case you want to write this down. When we get all these referral sources, we really need good information about how to contact the doctor. Sometimes, this is handwritten. Sometimes, it's missing entirely.

One thing that I had to build was a solution that would take whatever data we got from the doctor about who the doctor actually is, which sounds silly. If you get a referral from a doctor, you should have information about the doctor. Sometimes, we only have their name. We might not know where they practice. We might not know anything about them.

I have a solution that I built that will take this doctor, take any information that we can scrape out of referral documents, and use as much as we can using fuzzy matching in Python to find the NPI number in the NPI registry via API call. At that point, we're just using basic large language models to get all the contact information from the doctor, the city, the state zip code to create a complete doctor profile, so that we have a clean way of contacting the doctor.

You would think it would be pretty easy to get all this information on a doctor. It is really not. Many, many doctors, especially with telemedicine now, they practice in different places. You'll have a doctor who maybe works Friday in a telehealth, but they work in a medical office building the rest of the week. That means they have two separate NPIs and two separate contact information. One centralized AI clearing house to help people find the correct contact information for a doctor would be amazing and probably very cheap to build, to be honest with you.

Maybe one follow-up question for me over here. Given that Tennr is the first port of call, who's looking at this doctor referral that comes in for any patient, are they not doing this stuff for you?

**Expert**
It's not something that Tennr has considered to be a priority. They have a very simple yes, no at their intake. What Tennr does when they qualify their document is it comes into a queue that a manual person has to look at. It has a bunch of text fields. They're pre-populated text fields that you can change if you manually look at the document and say that you're disputing it.

The last thing they have is doctor. They have a suggestion as to who the doctor is. It's just going to have a last name and a first name. For example, one of our doctor's names is Nimit Patel. Do you know how many Nimit Patels practice in the United States? Thousands.

**Client**
Got it. I think the pain, at least, is super clear. I'm assuming some of these problems would have popped up when you all were doing pilots and evaluating Tennr. Was the value, that Tennr is providing, so much that you powered through despite these challenges and worked with someone like them?

**Expert**
Yes. The few things that they do well were enough to make it worth it. For our team, we have two people whose job it is to just go in and clean up doctors' information all the time. That was not something that they were establishing, looking for an AI solution. To be honest, that part does not even exist. Just being able to get an 80%, let's put a really low match on it. 80% of the health record created correctly and quickly was enough.

You know what? There isn't anything else out there that can do it as well as Tennr, even a year and a half later. I feel like a lot of these places, in theory, know how to do it, but they're selling solutions that don't really exist yet. The same thing with Tennr. With our insurance, I have a list of bugs here sitting on my desk of things I want fixed. They don't have the engineers to do it, but it's still better than 40 manual people.

You should know we also got Tennr reps somewhat of a discount when we started. I think they're charging the average person they're onboarding now about 4X as much. If I were evaluating Tennr today at that price with these bugs, I would have a real problem.

**Client**
Makes sense. Jumping in, it sounds like obviously AI has so far, underdelivered on its promise. Do you still think it's a step up from the largely manual processes you guys run previously, or you think it would've been.

**Expert**
Yeah, 100%. Even though it's not perfect, it's cleaner. One example I'll give you with Tennr is that Tennr does a terrible job with spaces and names. If your last name was Garcia Lopez and there's a space between it, it can't scrape that appropriately. It gets the rest of the patient chart pristinely correct. Having to go in there and fix maybe three or four of those a day is a small ask for our team, compared to having a high turnover rate of FTE. When humans touch things, mistakes happen.

**Client**
Makes sense. Taking a step back, you were mentioning you guys use, of course, like four to five point solutions. Of course, everybody claims to do the entire full stack offering. Are you, in any way, pained by the fact that you have multiple point solutions? Is there a desire to go with one provider, even if it's not perfect across? Do you think you're okay, even the long-term, to stick with these point solutions?

**Expert**
I think I could go either way with that. I think what we're going to see is the places, like maybe Tennr and Mandolin and even Cohere to some extent, are just going to start gobbling up the little one-off pieces like Synthpop. I think what you're going to see is that, in the next three or four years, these healthcare AI spaces,

the ones that do well are going to continually add services until everyone has one AI provider for intake of patient contact.

Just noticing from my side of things, watching not the admins but maybe the managers, the managers have no tolerance for learning new dashboards. If they know the Tennr dashboard, even if it costs more, if there's a solution they can offer, they're going to take it.

I do see this whole piecemeal where everybody has an AI solution for one thing and then another. I think that we're going to see some massive consolidation. The winners are going to win, and the losers are going to get acquired. I can see Synthpop being acquired.

**Client**
Makes complete sense. Just double-clicking a little bit here. When you compare Tennr, maybe back then it was quite early in the journey and that's why you guys got a discount. Today, if you had to compare these solutions against the leading offering. Let's say you compare Tennr against Cohere, Silna, etc., how do they stack up against each other? If today you were going to go make a net-new purchase decision, would you still go ahead and choose Tennr or would there be other solutions?

**Expert**
I think there would be other solutions. Maybe someday we won't, but right now, we're going to go back to who does what well. Cohere, they do nothing with charting. Nothing. They are exclusively a pre-auth company, and they are exclusively tied to Humana right now. If you want to use the Cohere product, you can't even use that as your pre-auth by itself.

We have very, very incomplete solutions all across the industry. I think I would always choose Tennr or Darby, depending on the price. They're very similar solutions for my charting. I can't say that I would ever ask for funding for the insurance piece of it again. It's too new. I don't love being the tester of all of the insurance infrastructure.

**Client**
Makes sense. Across this entire workflow, which is from the intake to verifying patient credentials, etc., what's the biggest pain point in your mind not just for your own company, but just broadly in the industry? Which of these companies has the sharpest point of entry?

**Expert**
It's always going to be insurance. I know because I was interviewing with a company not too long ago that was looking for me to do some data lake work for them. Insurance companies are benefiting from these pain points. AI is going to do its best to knock it down as much as it can. These friction points save probably billions of dollars for insurance companies. It's always going to be insurance. In the United States, it's always going to be the most painful part. Whoever can make this the smoothest is going to win.

To be honest, looking at Tennr or looking at Darby, this electronic chart creation using automation and AI, this is not a hard job. Amazon has most of the tools already at your disposal. You're just writing the scripts. The hard part is insurance because now you have to actually get contracts and compliance from multiple insurance companies. One thing Synthpop had, I'll give you an example. Synthpop was really trying to help in the insurance space. One of the reasons their failure rate was so high is because Blue Cross Blue Shield would not answer their calls.

You have to actually apply to be able to use a robocalling service. You have to actually ask Blue Cross Blue Shield if they will answer your robocalls. If they say no, there's nothing you can do about that. One thing that I'd like to bring to your attention, that might be an interesting thing for you to look at, is a product called Stedi. If you find an AI solution that is going to be making any calls to Stedi, I would be encouraged to look more in a company like that. Stedi has a fantastic infrastructure before the AI even comes into play.

**Client**
Makes sense. Could you say more about that? What exactly makes you say that?

**Expert**
Stedi is an API call-based insurance pre-auth and benefits verification platform. Companies can sign up for Stedi, and they can make an API call to Stedi with their patient's information and get benefits returned. It has a huge database. It knows the payers, and that's before they've really added a ton of AI. If you have a product that wants to start with what Stedi already has and add some large language models, you might win the entire insurance industry.

The point is, yes, you have to work with these insurance companies, but what you really need is whoever has the biggest database of payer information. The people who are gathering that every day, they're exponentially increasing the reliability of their decisions. It's just getting better every single day.

**Client**
Makes complete sense. Just going on a slightly different tangent here. I know you also mentioned briefly that you at least heard of or interacted with a solution called Coral, and you said it's a point solution. Would love to appreciate what these guys actually do and how they stack up against the others.

**Expert**
I have a little sheet I wrote out for them because I thought you might ask. I don't use them as much as I use the others. Think about Coral as something that might be applicable to healthcare in the future, but somebody's got to build it. What I've heard people use it for is things like if you have an online consult, Coral will be able to transcribe those meeting notes and things of that nature. It uses AI to help you put that information to places it needs to go. Coral didn't start out as a healthcare solution though, did it?

**Client**
It did, at least that's our understanding.

**Expert**
I did evaluate it, somewhat. From what I understood, I would have to build some of it myself. There's a platform, there's tools, but they're not tools that will just plug into anyone's current infrastructure. You would need to have an engineer to link those things up. I think that's going to be the problem with Coral.

**Client**
Could just say more about that? Do you mean that it needs to integrate well with these other tools or with the EHRs? Where's this gap exactly?

**Expert**
If we're talking about Coral Health, it's got some medical coding background. It's got a few things that it can do. What it can't do is plug into things. It can make decisions. It has the large language models. It can infer things. What they don't have is the ability to plug it in. Even on their own website, the custom engineering is the part where it's going to be a problem. That's actually an interesting point with a lot of them.

Every workflow is so different. There's always going to be a little bit of a custom engineering cost for all of these companies to sign new clients. I think they have room to grow. I really do. I think there's space for them in the market, but it doesn't plug in well. It doesn't plug in well right now. They need better ways to integrate with what people are currently using because these are not new doctor's offices. These are not new healthcare services. They need to be able to do a better job integrating with what's already there.

**Client**
Makes sense. I would like to appreciate, how much would typically health systems and companies like yourselves pay for these solutions? Just trying to get a sense of how large can these contracts get. Just to set some context here, for instance, we work very closely with a bunch of medical coding providers in the AI space.

Those contracts with health systems can be like almost multi-million-dollar contracts or even like large

100,000 accounts. Would that be similar in the prior auth and patient intake workflow?

**Expert**
I love Coral for this space. I love it for the medical coding space. My current role, there are maybe seven codes we ever use. We are so very specific in the work we do. We do not need to outsource it because we're either using Medicare codes or we're using regular codes. Codes is what gets people paid.

If their marketers can show a reliable change in not only the amount of time something is getting returned and how they're getting paid for, and maybe even if they're able to show that the reimbursement rates are higher, people are going to pay for this and it's going to be huge. Huge.

**Client**
Can give me a ballpark? I'm just trying to understand, would this be less than 100,000 accounts typically?

**Expert**
You want a framework of how much someone would be willing to pay for the solution?

**Client**
In the medical coding space, you typically make like 2%-3% of the entire billing. I'm just trying to get a sense of, is there a thumb rule? Like per chart, you charge that much? What's the way to estimate your contract with these companies?

**Expert**
Just so you know, company-wise, it's going to depend on what the services are providing. Medicare codes are a whole different ballgame than regular codes.

**Client**
No, sorry. I meant how much would you pay for solutions like Tennr and Coral and Cohere, etc.?

**Expert**
How much would I spend if I was taking the solution right now, or how much do I think it's worth?

**Client**
Yes.

**Expert**
Okay. For Tennr, in my current flow, they have me over a barrel. If they turned off tomorrow, I would not be able to get everyone coordinated and back from working the old way. If they decided to increase our spend by $10,000 a month, at this point I'd have to say yes. I think that you would find that that is the exact same case with Coral. If you're already using Coral, you have become a bigger part of the ecosystem. You will be able to continually ask for more money, and you will continually have to give it.

Once you're embedded and you don't have your own coders and your codes are outsourced, I could definitely see paying upwards of $100,000 a year for both of those solutions. That's just based on the company my side, though. If you're looking at like a hospital system, they're going to pay away.

**Client**
On the patient intake side of things, which is like your Tennrs of the world, are they seeing more adoption with companies like yourselves? Is it also consistent across like large health systems, think Mayo, Cleveland, etc.?

**Expert**
What I think you're going to find is that large health systems are going to start creating their own AI

solutions. The super large ones, they're either going to use a healthcare solution that they own part of or they're going to create their own. I think the value in a place like Tennr or Coral is not the big healthcare solutions spaces, it's the medium and small doctor's offices that just can't afford to hire all these people to support patient experience, to support the insurance.

Around here, I live in a very rural area, if you're a medical coder, there are medical coders that go work at a different office every day because these smaller places can't afford to pay a full-time coder. The value in those is really for your medium and small size businesses. I don't see them taking on a huge health system. Huge health systems are going to use Epic to manage their patients. You would need an Epic integration for that, and that is a very expensive thing to get. It's a little bit counterproductive to even start that way, as a medical AI start-up.
