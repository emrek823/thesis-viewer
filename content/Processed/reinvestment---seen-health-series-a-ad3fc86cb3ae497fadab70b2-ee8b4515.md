# Reinvestment - Seen Health Series A

## Overview
*   **Company Description:** Seen Health is building a tech-enabled, culturally-focused PACE program to serve high-needs seniors in Asian communities in California, who have historically been underserved due to language and cultural barriers as well as a lack of geographic coverage.
*   **URL:** https://www.seenhealth.org/
*   **Management Team:** Xing Su and Yang Su

## Financing
*   **Previous Financing:** Virtue participated in the previous $2.08M seed financing (April 2022) alongside 8VC (lead) on a SAFE with a $16M post-money cap. Virtue had invested $480K for 3% ownership.
*   **Round Size:** $20M
*   **Post-money:** $55.4M
*   **Virtue Investment Amount & Ownership:** $200K for 2.06% ownership following the Series A
*   **Financing Instrument:** Equity
*   **Syndicate:** 8VC leading, Basis Set, ApolloMed

## Series A Materials
**Data Room.** Key elements include: Deck, Financial Pro Forma, FAQ, Expanded Profile (Detailed Business Plan).

## Key Updates
**Application:** After 400+ pages of materials, 13 letters of support, 9 rounds of "Requests for Additional Information", and 9 meetings with regulators over the last six months, Seen secured approval and licenses from DHCS (California) and CMS (federal) to launch its first PACE clinic in Southern California in January 2024. Other for-profit PACE organizations that have been around for years (e.g., Edenbridge) are struggling to get their applications approved. PACE industry leaders are impressed, but unsurprised after meeting Xing and Yang, that the team has been able to move so quickly.

**Business Model and GTM Evolution:** Seen's tech-first approach provides the company with accelerated paths to market via partnerships that other PACE organizations have been unable to unlock. The company's first partnership is with ApolloMed ($AMEH) a $2.27B PCP risk-bearing entity with $1.14B in revenue and 1.3M patients managed in VBC contracts. ApolloMed invested $2M in this round in an uncapped SAFE and is exploring commercial arrangements where Seen provides data/patient ID services through its tech entity while Apollo offers Seen its provider network, network management / payer services, and Apollo's community physicians participate as a part of Seen's PACE IDT. Seen also signed a 1-year pilot with West Health (PACE center in San Diego) to provide pieces of its tech platform to aid West Health's operations.

## Revisiting Opportunities/Risks from the Seed
Xing and Yang have not only leveraged their strengths to exceed expectations but de-risked key areas of the business with creative and thoughtful approaches.

| **Founding team**           | During the initial diligence process, we rated Xing and Yang as one of the top management teams we had engaged over the last 5+ years. While we came in with high expectations, we were blown away by their ability to receive the necessary applications and letters of intent in near record time. When we think about founder-market fit for Xing and Yang in a PACE market with consolidated demand (low patient census) and consolidated supply (clinic with small service area), Xing and Yang have more than demonstrated their ability to "plow through walls" with the initial application. This dynamic is very similar to the founding of Oak Street Health (now part of CVS Health), where Mike Pykosz was a lawyer and consultant before founding a brick and mortar primary care business.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **PACE Derivatives**        | "Unbundling PACE" (or PACE derivatives as the industry calls it) is an opportunity to take the clinical chassis, internal know-how, and technology platform for PACE and extend into other areas of at-home and community care. We thought this would be an opportunity that Seen pursued with the Series A capital, but they are ahead of schedule and have shown early signals with ApolloMed and West Health.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Market Dynamics**         | While we initially predicted the growth of the for-profit PACE industry last year (true), recent policy changes in PACE and backlash around privately-backed managed care companies (especially in CA) may alter Seen's strategy going forward.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| **Timeline and Capital Intensity** | The timeline and capital intensity of PACE is top of mind for all PACE investors, especially for a fund of our size. The team has been especially creative in thinking through a letter of support from 8VC to secure its PACE applications instead of having to raise expensive equity. In addition, the team is working with NCV to be able to finance 75% of its RE costs and 100% of working capital losses, which means the company will have a decent buffer to build additional centers and not be forced to raise a Series B earlier than required.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Healthcare Experience**     | ApolloMed is one of - if not the - most respected VBC organization in the country. Seen is the first PACE entity Apollo has engaged with. This relationship is a testament to their healthcare ability they have developed over the last 2 years, but the team is also well aware of their gaps. They have been able to mobilize a star-studded roster of consultants and advisors who are moving the needle on a day-to-day basis for clinical operations, real-estate, and network/PBM relationships.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Economic Recession / Downturn** | With the venture capital markets recalibrating after the excess of 2020 and 2021, there was a risk that capital-intensive businesses like Seen may have a harder time raising capital. While this dynamic may impact the perception of certain investors, the reality of the PACE market and its unique dynamics mean the approved application put a quantifiable "floor" on the value of the business. |

## Case for 10X
With every reinvestment, we use our privileged access and position with management teams to re-underwrite our investment case to ensure 10x potential from its current valuation. Based on other PACE comps in market and member based valuations for managed care models in general (below), we conservatively estimate that each PACE member creates ~$175K in enterprise value. To reach a $500M+ valuation Seen would have to have a census of 300-350 patients. This means Seen would have to stand up 1-2 additional PACE clinics and execute on its technology strategy and partnerships, which we have high confidence in given execution to-date.
