### Conversation

**Client**: I thought I answered that I wasn't part of the decision-making process, but I have been using Brellium for a year and a half at this point.

**Expert**: Got it. Were you there when Brellium got brought in? Do you think you can speak to why it's important to Grow Therapy?

**Expert**: I can definitely speak on why it's important. I, candidly, wasn't there, but I can speak ad nauseam about why it's important.

**Client**: Okay, that's really fine. Maybe before we dive in specifically to Brellium, it'd be great if you could provide just a little bit of background on your role at Grow Therapy and then we can go from there.

**Expert**: I'm on the clinical team, and so that's our team that is trying to uphold a certain level of quality within our network. That means working directly with providers, be that therapists or prescribers, to make sure that they are delivering clinically best practices. Specifically with regards to Brellium, that is also covering documentation best practices and making sure that people are audit-ready.

Because we work with payers, there's certain times that they'll ask for claims information in order to verify that care is being delivered in the way that they want it. That's how we've leveraged Brellium. My team is actually the team that works directly in Brellium, day in, day out to set up the systems and also feed in the information and also parse through what data Brellium sends us back, as well as tweaking how we configure it and also dealing with the contract. I don't have a license, but the rest of my team has a license.

**Client**: Great. How big is your team that's in Brellium?

**Expert**: We have probably like four or five people day in, day out, different team members. It's like 1/3 of our team is at random moments.

**Client**: Got it. When you joined Grow Therapy, was Brellium already being used or were you guys doing something else?

**Expert**: When I started, the contract with Brellium had just been signed. I was brought in right after that. We were utilizing manual peer reviewers. Other clinicians who would go in and look at the charts to see whether or not they would pass or not. Once we brought Brellium in, we were able to automate a lot of it.

**Client**: Got it. I know you were in there for the decision-making process, but do you have a sense for why they started looking for a solution? Is it that these checks got too cumbersome or, I do not know, you guys were trying to slash costs? I'm curious if you had any visibility into why looking for a solution then.

**Expert**: I mean, it's all of those things. Especially if you have a lot of humans who are checking something. One, it's a lot slower. You're not able to send as many claims in. If we want to get the entire company audit ready or providers audit ready, and you're limited by both cost and by time, if you're sending it through humans, I...

think the peer reviewers probably could do, I don't know, maybe a few dozen a day.

Whereas Brellium, it takes one or two days for us to run upwards of thousands of claims through them. That's almost instantaneously once we were been able to set up the system. If you're relying on humans, it's like you can get it throughout the month, but you have to wait until the end of the month for them to be able to parse through.

If someone gets sick, especially if they're contractors, then your output is immediately decreased. Some peer reviewers are better than others. You're relying on just how good they are. It's not like you can hire someone off the street for it. Talent to find was also hard. We couldn't just hire a bunch of people. We have to train them as well. There's a lot of just human elements that would slow us down. It also was more expensive. Obviously if you're paying someone X number of dollars an hour versus paying Brellium the set fee, it is also a lot cheaper.

## Client
Got it. Did you say that part of why you guys brought Brellium in is because you're trying to get the company audit-ready? Is it because you knew when the audit was happening and you wanted to make sure you were up to snuff or just that at one point there will be an audit?

## Expert
I mean, in any regulated environment audits are not a matter of if, but when. The company had gone through a few things already. It's like they knew what effort it took. It behooves any company in a regulated industry to make sure that all the claims that we're funneling through or that are funneled through our system are going to be audit-ready. It's like yes, both. Not just also solving for past audits that we went through, but also in anticipation of future ones. Just because when an audit comes, if they find a mistake, it's so much more work to correct the mistake, but then proactively having things ready already.

Especially because with claims in general, the nature of notes is that if you don't correct it close to the date, things get lost in the ether. If you think about even in your personal life, if you have to chase down a bill from a week ago, it's easier to do that than bill Sean Doolan from six months ago. The speed is necessary. That's why we wanted to get a system that could do it within a certain amount of time. Again, when you're relying on humans, the time element is crucial.

## Client
Super helpful. I know Brellium has several modules. Do you use them for several modules or just one thing?

## Expert
We primarily have two different types of providers, prescribers and therapists. They conduct very different types of services, and so we have different modules for that. When you think about different CPT codes, there's also going to be different pass rates according to that. I think an intake session is probably going to be very different than a psychotherapy session that you have to write down medication management. All of those things require different questions and different structure within the note. That's how we differentiate it or that it needs to be differentiated in the system.

## Client
Okay. You're using them for charting and other stuff?

## Expert
I mean we're using it for charting. Yes.

## Client
Do you guys have scribes, like AI notetakers?

## Client-Expert Interaction

### Client
For the patient interactions that you all have, instead of taking manual notes, are you using AI scribes or are you guys still doing it manually?

### Expert
We are doing that with AI right now.

### Client
You know what scribe you're using?

### Expert
It's an in-house one.

### Client
Got it. Then you're feeding it into Brellium and Brellium is doing the compliance on it.

### Expert
It's also an opt-in. Not all of the sessions are through AI. This still reads it for the folks who are not using it as well.

### Client
That's helpful. Maybe just since you've been using the product for a couple of months and you're in it on a daily basis, what's been your overall take on it? Do you like using it? Are there things that they could improve?

### Expert
I mean there's Series A. It's the classic I think working with a small company, things break. I think that the need is there and we definitely need them and utilize them. It's a big improvement from doing it manually with humans. I think that it's your typical, like, "Oh, this got messed up. Oh, we were supposed to send this and then this was sent instead."

My impression, this is my personal opinion and not the company opinion, but it's working through many startups. It feels like some of their processes are held together by popsicle sticks and glue. Something messes up and it's like, "Why did that mess up? How did you guys send that to the wrong group? That doesn't make sense." Or, "How did you leave out what we told you to put in?" Things like that where it's just a small company kind of thing that I've seen at many iterations of a small SaaS company.

### Client
Maybe it hasn't been enough time, but would you say that they're quick to make changes and push out new products? How have you felt about their speed of development?

### Expert
It's been all right. I think it was like a C, C+ maybe, B, of interacting with them. I haven't been super impressed by their speed, but I also don't think it's bad enough. It's more like annoying sometimes than anything else, so it's fine. An ambivalent answer really.

### Client
When you think about ROI, is it largely time saved? Is it that you were able to get rid of all of the manual peer reviewers? If you had to make the case for keeping Brellium for next year to your CFO, how do you justify how much you guys pay for it?

# Expert Interview Transcript

## Expert
It's the ROI, it's like you can extrapolate from there what our pass rate would be if we didn't. Actually, we wouldn't even be able to measure pass rate. It's not necessarily improving our pass rate. It's helping us set the groundwork to be able to track whether or not we would pass. It's almost a binary. Brellium, they don't have a layer over it, at least not yet to say, "Hey, from all of the data that we are parsing through and we are analyzing, this is what you should do with your providers, or this is what you should change." That's all on us.

What they do, how I think about it is not necessarily the ROI of it, but it allows us to actually have a line in the sand. What you could say is that you could extrapolate that by saying, "Oh, we wouldn't be able to even track any of these changes at all without Brellium." It's not necessarily tied to the increase, but it's like we wouldn't even be able to do any of this if we don't have Brellium, pretty much, if that makes sense. It's not necessarily like incremental, like, "Oh, this saved us 2% on the pass rate." It's like, "Oh, we wouldn't even be able to measure the pass rate."

## Client
That makes a lot of sense. Do you have any sense for how much you guys are paying for Brellium or do you not have visibility into that?

## Expert
I don't have the contract. I don't have it.

## Client
That's okay. I'm curious, it seems like you're in Brellium on a daily basis. Are there any other AI or just software solutions that you also use in your day-to-day job?

## Expert
My team, just to be clear too, we set up the systems for our clinicians on the team to be able to help out providers. You are asking the right person. In terms of AI tools that we actually use day-to-day in order to help providers, not necessarily something that my team particularly uses, but Grow in general is trying to, and as with any other company out there, is trying to provide AI tools for the providers, but not necessarily something that there is no really AI use except for ChatGPT, I am sure everyone uses that at least in our toolbox.

Just to differentiate our internal team, Brellium is the only AI tool that our internal team uses. At least my specific clinical operations team. The AI use that providers use, that's in-house within our systems that people are figuring out about.

## Client
Got it. Just curious, if the experience has been a bit mixed so far as far as velocity and level of support and everything. Have you guys looked for alternatives? Are you looking at moving off of Brellium?

## Expert
It takes a lot. I mean it's the stickiness. It's like it takes so long for us to set it up. I think they assigned it like a week or two after I joined and it took two or three months to get it running. In that time that's a lot of time, a lot of effort. It's with any sort of SaaS integration that once you're in their environment it's pretty hard to get out of it. I think again I'm ambivalent, but maybe I'm a little bit critical. It still works for what we need to do. It's just there's some things that happen sometimes.

I'm sure that anyone who works in a tech company, you'll have maybe 50% of your vendors you're ambivalent about because they sell you on something great and then once you're actually using them, it's like, "Whoa, you messed up on this." That's how I feel about vendors, actually. Honestly, if they hit a C, it's like that's fine.

**Client:** Are there any specific examples that you would point to of things that have been fucked up or stuff that you've been less than pleased by?

**Expert:** Sorry, say again?

**Client:** Just out of curiosity, are there any specific examples that you would point to of things that have been fucked up or stuff that you've been less than pleased by?

**Expert:** I mean, it's just like, even small. They send out emails. We can set up a system where they send out emails to providers. It's like small things where they sent it to the incorrect group. We're just like, "How did that happen? We gave you everything. We set the parameters." Other things like when we're QAing the new modules you call them, just as like, "Why does this look like this? This is not what I asked for in the meeting." It's like, "Okay, let's go over it again. This is what we actually mean." It requires a few iterations.

I'm not sure if that says more about the customer success manager, or the technology itself. What it results in is just like, "Why did this get messed up?" Things taking slightly longer than they're supposed to, or just even small things where I think they don't even provide unique claim ID. They don't have unique audit IDs. It's annoying to have to parse through the data. It's really small things where you think as a layperson that it's not that hard to implement, or it's like a duh. Why don't you have a unique audit to claim ID?

If you run another audit, there might be two rows of the same claim with different audit results if they resubmitted it. You have to differentiate it based on other fields rather than just a unique ID. Things like that where it's just like again, what I consider very early stage company struggles.

**Client:** Got it. We talked about what they do well and not. You touched this a little bit, are there some obvious product areas that they can build for you guys as a next step that would be super valuable that are adjacent to what they do today.

**Expert:** I think that what I mentioned earlier, almost that consulting layer on top of it. It's like they help set the infrastructure to be able to see what's going on in the claims that we send them. I don't think there's necessarily a strategic overlay of just this is 90% failed in this one area, this is what you guys should do or this is like the outreach. I think that would help. I would add, not answering your question directly, but what I would caution is I don't know if there's as much of a moat for the particular use case that we're using now because I think that especially with what we're asking them to do is just to be able to audit claims afterwards. It is most beneficial if we are able to do this in real-time.

I think maybe what would be most helpful for Brellium is if they were able to be integrated into their customer systems so that they can deliver real-time results. How it happens now is that we do this on a monthly batch. We are an ad hoc and/or a monthly batch where we download all the claims, then we upload them. We could do it the day after, but we don't find it necessary to do that because it's just a lot of work to do that on the daily. I mean eventually once we build an API maybe, but that's also taking months for us to do just because of engineering capacity on both ends.

I think that building an easier way to integrate within their customer's API would probably be a big unlock and also be able to create a moat because if you're starting to build it in-house, like these AI capabilities, why would you need Brellium?

**Client:** That makes sense. On both of those points, both being more in line, real-time integrated into the workflow and also being more strategic about the insights, would either of those, if they were available, make you pay more for the tool because you'd be getting more value? Is it more like, "Hey, these are almost table stakes. If...

**Expert**
The strategic insights, I think, is maybe less important for us. I think the latter one that I just said is way more important. Again, going back to my earlier analogy. If you're asked to remember something from a week ago versus yesterday or six months ago, you're going to remember the thing yesterday. It depends on your short-term memory or whatever.

Most likely you're going to remember something from yesterday versus, "By the way, do you remember a month ago when you met with Caroline and you didn't put that she was diagnosed with blah, blah, blah?" You're like, "What? I've met with Caroline three times since. I don't remember that note. I have to go back." There's that loss of action.

**Client**
Thanks so much. This has been super helpful. Really appreciate the time.
