### Portfolio Company Updates

- 32 Murals: Decent position, needs 1-2 major contracts
	- $2.5M convertible note, runway not material concern
- Anna: Exceptional performance, preempted with $17.5M Series A term sheet
	- Closing before year-end
	- Board member with full financial access
- Clara: Worst performing company on list
	- Need significant improvement
- Mural: ~$20M bookings expected by year-end
	- Ahead of pace, limited visibility on details
- Integral: Strong business growth
	- Started year at $500K, ending between $6-9M ACV
	- Term sheet expected this week/next
- Solstice: Strong momentum with contracts signed in last 90 days
	- Series A fundraise planned January/February
- Zoom Logic: Good progress, fine contract acquisition
	- High Series A interest for next year raise
- Valley Steer: $1.5-2M top line revenue
	- Sufficient for Series A if chosen

### Right Site Concerns & Valuation Approach

- Major underperformer burning >$800K monthly vs minimal revenue
- Raised ~$25M total, at “put up or shut up” phase
- Recommendation: Write down to cost (not full write-off)
	- Proactive, responsible GP approach
	- Flag as concern for LP conversations
	- Still has 8-10 months runway

### Market Valuation Discussion

- Current portfolio appropriately valued, nothing “aggressively frothy”
- Market seeing high Series A prices (Translucent: $105-100M after 6-7 months)
	- Series B at $500M-1B range
- Most GPs taking frothy marks during current period
- Agreement to intervene if marks become unrealistic vs value

### Recent Investment Activity

- Prudential closed: Now $17.5M Series A at $75M post
	- No follow-on investment planned
- Hermes: Received $4M SAFE term sheet at $18M post
	- Original investment: $500K at $5M post (lowest price pre-seed)
	- Accelerated process to close before holidays
	- No additional investment expected

### Next Steps

- Sean: Compile spreadsheet with portfolio company metrics
	- Cash position, runway, revenue/ARR, qualitative updates
	- Leverage upcoming portfolio calls and board meetings
	- May need to request Mural financials directly
- Dave: Review cash position next week for distribution decisions
	- Payroll impact on available cash
	- Frank Rimmerman may request company financial statements for validation
