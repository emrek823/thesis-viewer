### Company Background & Investment Focus

- Virtue VC: $55M Fund II (previously $30M Fund I)
	- Exclusively early-stage healthcare (everything except pure therapeutics)
	- Check sizes: $500K - $2M
	- 75% first-time founders in portfolio
- Portfolio spans data infrastructure, revenue cycle management, consumer health, care delivery, pharma/specialty pharmacy
- Evvy connection: First investment ever
	- Direct-to-consumer vaginal microbiome testing
	- Built strong TikTok presence before developing advanced bioinformatics
	- Now licensing data to pharma companies, approaching Series B

### Ayen & Team’s Project Status

- Ayen working on women’s health/maternal health project
- Team of 3 people currently
- Very early stage (pre-product, high-level concept)
- Exploring direct-to-consumer approach with AI/bioinformatics angle
- Similar themes to Evvy: data collection, consumer engagement, addressing research gaps in women’s health

### Market Positioning & Strategy Discussion

- Maternal health extremely crowded space over past 5 years
- Most existing solutions follow traditional playbook: telehealth + insurance + value-based care
- Opportunity for novel approach given team’s backgrounds
- Direct-to-consumer route avoids insurance complexity
- Laboratory Developed Tests (LDTs) pathway for regulatory approach
	- Partner with labs rather than seeking diagnostics approval
	- Provide insights/recommendations rather than diagnoses

### Go-to-Market Insights

- Focus on execution over perfect product initially
- Local OB/GYN outreach more effective than pitching large health systems
	- Less saturated with vendor pitches
	- More open to innovative approaches
- Guerrilla marketing tactics recommended for early traction

### Next Steps

- Emre to connect team with relevant founders and NYC healthcare events
- Team to refine concept and define specific 3-6 month milestones
- Ongoing communication as fundraising needs become clearer
