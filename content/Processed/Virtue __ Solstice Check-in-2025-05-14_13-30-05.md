### Growth & Pipeline Update

- Q2 ARR projection: $300-400k
- Q3 ARR projection: $1M+
- Pharma pipeline targets:
	- Stemline
	- Axsome - Director of marketing initially ghosted after MLR pitch, but highly engaged after content gen pitch
	- Pilot with Sanofi
- Agency pipeline showing strong inbound interest
	- Multiple agencies initiating follow-up conversations
	- Seeing organic discussion about Solstice on industry channels

### Product Strategy & Positioning

- Shifting focus from dual product strategy to pharma-focused content generation
- Fact Check Assistant status:
	- System works on 70-80% of documents without issues
	- Not yet fully self-sufficient
	- Considering limiting scope rather than pursuing full functionality
- Content Generation platform:
	- Demonstrated capability to generate fully compliant marketing emails
	- Can incorporate brand guidelines and design elements
	- Includes automated compliance checking
	- Enables real-time content adjustments

### Agency vs Direct-to-Pharma Strategy

- Agency relationships provide:
	- Distribution opportunities (though relationship ownership is challenging)
	- Product improvement insights
	- Entry point to large pharma (e.g., Merck, Novartis)
- Strategic approach:
	- Use agencies (like Publicis) as backdoor entrance to enterprise pharma
	- Focus direct sales on mid-cap pharma companies
	- Long-term goal to serve pharma directly
- Competitive insight: Publicis charging $10M/year for their AI platform with limited capabilities

### Next Steps

- Focus on closing 2-3 deals before pursuing additional investor conversations
- Continue product development on content generation platform
- Develop formal projections for Q3/Q4
- Explore enterprise implementation and pricing strategies:
	- Implementation fees
	- Service fees
	- Enterprise-specific features
