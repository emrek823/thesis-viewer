## Slide 3: CEO Summary - Nov '25 and Full-Year Performance

# CEO Summary - Nov '25 and Full-Year Performance

## Introduction
Our goal entering the final months of 2025 is to reach positive unit economics by closing case-rate contracts, scaling EMS call volume, and continuing to reduce Care Team cost per episode.

Based on our current forecast, we expect to turn gross profit positive once BCBS Texas, BCBS Georgia, and United contracts in Texas and Georgia are executed, and we sustain an average of about 100 activations per day. We are not there yet, but we are close on both fronts. BCBS Texas has been approved, and BCBS Georgia and United Texas are in late-stage approval, with executive sponsors pushing toward a January 1 effective date. EMS call volume continues to grow across our core markets as we strengthen EMS account management execution.

What follows summarizes what worked in 2025, what slowed us down, and why 2026 will be defined more by execution than by strategy.

## November Results
In November, RightSite delivered 1,246 total activations and 624 diversions. Payor diversion rates held at 82%, and EMS redirect rates were 81%, showing clinical performance remained steady as volume increased. Patient acceptance rates remained above 90% across dispatch and field encounters, and patient satisfaction scores stayed high.

Patient care costs declined as Care Team operations improved. Navigator overtime fell 41% with better scheduling, while navigator efficiency increased from 0.9 to 2.3 episodes/hr, a 155% gain, and physician efficiency increased 25%, from 4 to 5 episodes/hr, driven by stronger physician-navigator alignment. These operating improvements translated into material Q3–Q4 episode cost reductions, including a 66% drop in urgent care cost per episode, a 40% reduction in transportation spend, and a 45% reduction in prescription spend.

## 2025 Year-in-Review Performance
From January through November, RightSite delivered nearly 12,000 activations and more than 6,300 diversions. About 9,000 episodes avoided an ambulance transport, generating more than $21M in EMS savings and over $23M in combined taxpayer and health plan savings.

Performance remained consistent across markets. EMS redirect rates averaged above 80%, and total diversion rates held near 60%.

Care Team operations remained within target ranges. Time-to-answer, time-to-physician, and EMS release metrics stayed within target ranges, while follow-up reach rates averaged around 70%. Time-and-motion work, staffing refinements, and more selective use of SDOH resources reduced cost per activation. We still have work to do, but cost per episode is clearly manageable with discipline.

## What Worked and What Didn't
What worked in 2025 was the operating model. EMS interest accelerated across Texas, Georgia, and Florida, and our reputation as a dependable partner drove inbound demand. We also began taking share from Tele911, confirming our differentiation is showing up in the market.

Our payer value proposition sharpened. We shifted to unit-based analysis, leaned into EMS density, moved contracting conversations to state-level teams, and engaged third-party actuarial validation. Together, these changes reduced friction for payer teams and improved late-stage momentum.

## Slide 4: CEO Summary - Nov '25 and Full-Year Performance

# CEO Summary - Nov '25 and Full-Year Performance

## What Worked and What Didn't (con't)
What did not work as well was we missed the gross profit profitability target. Payer contracting cycles ran longer than planned, delaying case-rate execution. EMS sales and go-lives outpaced account management capacity, stretching a lean account management team. Physician licensing and credentialing difficulties delayed collections and complicated scheduling. Limited engineering capacity slowed product work that would otherwise help reduce costs faster. None of these issues change the model, but all affect timing and achieving our gross profit profitability target.

## Looking Ahead to 2026
We've built a 2026 forecast model designed to support disciplined scaling while protecting cash. It assumes daily activations rising from roughly 65 in December 2025 to 157 by December 2026, with diversion rates holding near 58%, consistent with 2025 performance.

The model focuses on Texas and Georgia, where EMS density and payer engagement are strongest. Florida, the walk-in service line, and expanded Foundation activity for uninsured costs are excluded from the forecast to avoid overpromising on revenue. Each represents potential upside, but none is required to achieve positive gross profit.

Execution in 2026 comes down to three priorities: closing and activating case-rate contracts, scaling EMS go-lives in large MSAs, and continuing to reduce Care Team cost per episode through staffing mix with RNs and APPs to improve physician efficiency, improved workflow, and leveraging RightSite Connect, AI and other technology platforms. At this stage, success depends more on execution than on a new strategy.

The core risks for 2026 remain payer contract timing and the pace at which EMS agencies can be implemented to increase call volume. As scale increases, execution risk rises, particularly given the real-time, service-based nature of what we deliver.

At the same time, external tailwinds are increasing. EMS and ER systems face growing financial pressure as ambulance and ER economics worsen, and the number of uninsured and underinsured patients grows. Congress’ failure to extend ACA subsidies is likely to intensify that pressure, accelerating demand for alternatives to the automatic 911-to-ER pathway for non-emergent care.

The competitive landscape is also shifting. Tele911 and MedAlly appear less active, and we are already taking share from Tele911 in Texas. EMS agencies consistently describe clear operational and clinical differences in working with RightSite. GMR’s nurse line remains a potential competitor, but EMS agencies report low redirection rates, creating an opening for deeper engagement with GMR in 2026.

Within the Care Team, the focus remains on disciplined cost reduction per episode through test-and-learn models and tighter resource allocation, especially with free-rider payers. Taken together, 2026 looks less like a year of proving the model and more like a year where execution determines outcomes. If we execute well, RightSite has the opportunity to become the category leader in redefining non-emergent 911 and ER care.

**Footnotes**
1- November miss due to delayed payor contracts and modulated EMS call volume
2- November miss due to cautious call volume growth tactics awaiting BCBS/TX, BCBS/GA and United case rates
3- High patient care cost miss due to (1) low denominator from low call volume and (2) MD overstaffing from Fort Worth

## Slide 7: Payor Update

# Payor Update

## What We Planned to Deliver (Q4)
*   Deliver executed payer contracts that generate gross profit at forecast call volume.
*   Priority contracts targeted for Q4 close:
    *   BCBS/TX
    *   BCBS/GA (Elevance/Amerigroup)
    *   UnitedHealthcare/TX
    *   Aetna Medicaid TX (contract renewal)
*   Targeted for Q1 close:

    *   Centene / Superior (TX)
    *   United GA – fast follow
    *   Cigna – all states
    *   Contract first “Walk-In” hospital client
*   Payer Account Management works with clinical and quality leaders at payers to unlock additional care-episode revenue.

## What We Delivered (Highlights)
*   BCBS-TX ~$1,000 case rate; all hurdles cleared, contract expected week of 12/15.
*   United-TX cleared MEU, and in contracting.
*   Elevance-GA in contracting, claims configuration and legal underway. Verbal for 1/1 effective date

## Slide 8: Payor Update (con't)

# Payor Update (con't)

## What Happened
**Sales Strategy**
*   **RightSite Eligibility Code Set (RightSite IP):** We've now completed the creation of the first “in-911-call” treatable code set, now active in testing with Elevance Georgia, and soon with Oscar.
*   **Using 2024 CMS Claims, RightSite Code Set Saving Analysis completed and integrated into sales process:** Allows us to differentiate RightSite from traditionally used Preventable ER Analysis early in sales process avoiding unnecessary MEU cycles, driving higher case rates and speeding time to contracting.
*   **Free-rider plans:** We are now billing non-par plans, and routing those members through a low-navigation pathway with limited rideshare access and no follow-up, benefit education, or reporting.
*   **Investor-driven networking:** Active across United, Elevance, Centene, Cigna, BCBS Texas, Oscar, and Florida Blue, with Paul McBride and Billy Millwee accelerating deal cycles and sharpening sales strategy.

## What's Next
*   Close BCBS-TX, and Elevance-GA in December.
*   Close United-TX, Superior TX, Oscar and Cigna in Q1.
*   Reach Gross Profit (BCBS GA, TX and United GA, TX)
*   Close remainder of TX County Medicaid Plans
*   Advance the Wellmed Texas and United/Optum national contract.
*   Continue pursuing delegated-risk partners like Equality Health (and Wellmed) as an alternative to direct payer contracting.
*   Test new revenue streams with contracted plans, including bonuses tied to Quality Measures and Program Referrals.
*   Finalize and launch the Walk-In service line pilot to validate this product extension and its payer and hospital value.
*   Start recruiting and creating a bench for Payers Account Management role

## Challenges
*   Georgia's Medicaid award protests will not resolve until mid-2026, which delays activation of our signed LOIs with United and extending our Molina contract
*   Ongoing payor leadership and sponsor turnover make sales cycles unpredictable. Decision makers hesitate on value-based programs due to past failures and fear of job loss.
*   ACA and Medicaid uncertainty, both federally and in state RFPs, continues to slow payer decision-making and extend sales timelines.
*   Existing Payer Team is too small to support strategic account management after forecasted contracts close in Q1.

## Slide 12: EMS Update

# EMS Update

## What's Next
*   Close "Big 4" - Dallas, Gwinnett, El Paso and Austin
*   Hire and onboard new VP EMS Account Management
*   Recruit for Texas and Georgia A/M bench
*   Hire SDR to support EMS Growth Team and manage top of the funnel activity

## Challenges
*   The EMS sales team is too thin to handle the ‘26 pipeline, and the AM team is too small to reliably execute growth strategies at "full-bright" once gross profit is generated.
*   Florida - Jacksonville is mired in political drama, and is a risky reference source. We will need new Florida EMS referenceable agencies once Florida payer contracts are executed.

## Slide 15: Government Relations

# Government Relations

## What Happened
*   We have met with Medicaid leaders in all three states and stay in active conversation about the RightSite model. They understood the problem immediately and required no education. We delivered detailed analyses for their Managed Medicaid and Fee-for-Service lines of business.
*   In Florida, the Deputy Secretary of Health secured support to file a statewide Treat-no-Transport bill for EMS. It will need strong backing to advance. Ballard Partners, our lobbyist, gives it even odds of passing on a first attempt to change reimbursement mandates. We also submitted our RHTF application, and the state's CMS filing may create a path for telehealth funding, though support for other services remains uncertain. AHCA is evaluating a reimbursement model that mirrors our case rate, and they plan to decide in January.
*   In Georgia, the state's RHTF application to CMS includes a request for EMS telehealth technology funding. We are also working with our lobbyist to identify early funding sources for uninsured patients in select cities and counties.
*   In Texas, we met with the State Medicaid Administrator to review our model. They noted its simplicity, the savings potential, and its alignment with state, plan, patient, and EMS priorities. In early 2026, we plan to pursue a case rate for Fee-for-Service Medicaid and to broaden the treat-no-transport fee to include dispatch. We also submitted our Texas RHTF application, and the state's CMS filing may create an opportunity to secure funds for reducing non-emergent ER visits through after-hours clinics. The rollout remains uncertain.

## What's Next
*   Awaiting notification from FL on a case rate for FFS Medicaid
*   Meet with the incoming TX Medicaid Director
*   Next steps for state specific RHTF applications
*   Meetings in GA for possible uninsured funding

## Challenges
*   Typical Government Relations activities uncertainty of outcome and timing

## Slide 16: RightSite Community Foundation

# RightSite Community Foundation

## What Happened
*   We have accepted $40k in donations so far, and we have used those funds to offset the cost of caring for uninsured patients.
*   Our Executive Director has moved on because the role was not the right fit.
*   We are rebranding the Foundation as “The Right Connection” to give it a clear identity separate from RightSite Health.
*   We will keep the Foundation active by pursuing a few targeted grant applications and by continuing introductions that can expand our impact.

## What's Next
*   We will be adding new Foundation BOD members so Jamo and Michael can be replaced
*   We will replace the Executive Director after the company's gross profit turns positive.

## Challenges
*   We will need a new Executive Director with strong business development skills who can build a platform that meaningfully reduces the cost of care for uninsured patients. This role will not be filled until the company generates a gross profit.
*   The timing for reengaging donors will depend on the arrival of our Director.

## Slide 17: Revenue Cycle Management

# Revenue Cycle Management

## What Happened
**Case Rate Billing**
*   Molina case rates are fully configured, billed, and now generating payments.
*   Reconciliation processes are in place.
*   Only 5-10% of patients return to the ER after the initial encounter, with Medicare patients closer to 10%.

**FFS Billing**
*   We began billing non-contracted plans in Sept for Cigna, Humana Texas, and Devoted. 70% of Sept claims were paid, and for the Oct claims, 30% have paid so far.

**Insurance Identification**
*   Began collecting patient SSNs at the start of each episode and now obtain them in over 70% of patients.
*   Refreshed Care Team training on insurance workflows and pVerify, our real-time eligibility platform.
*   Advanced automated tools for insurance documentation to speed up billing.

**Physician Licensing and Credentialing**
*   Georgia's physician-licensing agency switched systems without clear communication with providers, which slowed new-physician approvals. The issue appears resolved. GA credentialing has also been delayed.
*   We made significant upgrades to our licensing and credentialing system.

## What's Next
*   Finalize the last encounter types and load them into the billing system.
*   Identify all non-contracted plans that pay and bill every eligible claim with date of service before Sept.
*   Continue building automations that speed up insurance documentation.
*   Our new billing specialist started on 12/8 and sits inside the Care Team to enhance patient demo data accuracy.
*   Due to the new CMS requirement, we'll enroll and reassign physicians to the provider site of service using home addresses rather than patient locations. For our physicians, this requires enrollment in three additional states for Medicare FFS under CMS's 10/31 guideline.

## Challenges
*   **PeachState Case Rates** - Continues to be a challenge for PeachState to keep its system configured.
*   **Telehealth Rules for CMS** - Our ability to bill Medicare is contingent on the extension of rules each Continuing Resolution cycle. We held claims during the government shutdown and released them when the CR passed.

## Slide 18: Care Team Operations

# Care Team Operations

## What Happened
**Operational Performance for Nov.**
*   Time to Answer: **11 sec**
*   Time-to-Doc: **5.9 min**
*   Dispatch Release: **3 min**
*   Field Release: **15 min**
*   Patient Satisfaction: **9.7/10**
*   Follow-Up Reach Rate: **65%**

*   Navigator Overtime Pay: ↓ **41%** (better scheduling)
*   Navigator Throughput: **0.9 → 2.3 episodes/hr** (155% increase)
*   Physician Throughput: **4 → 5 episodes/hr** (25% increase)
*   Qualitative: strong Physician:Navigator alignment

**Q3-Q4 Episode Cost Reductions**
*   Urgent Care Cost/Episode: ↓ **66%**
*   Transportation: ↓ **40%**
*   Rx Spend: ↓ **45%**

## What Happened (con't)
**Care Team Programs Underway**
*   **Operation No Navigation (“Free Rider Payors”)**. Limits service to telehealth-only for non-contracted plans, reducing uncompensated care while giving Sales more leverage with free rider payors.
*   **Care Team-EMS Alignment**. Deepens coordination between the Care Team and the EMS A/M team to increase call volume performance.
*   **First RN Integrated into Care Team**. Offloading pharmacy follow up to RNs increases physician throughput.
*   **Optimized Physician Scheduling**. We are matching our most seasoned and credentialed physicians to peak-volume shifts to reduce overall physician cost, improve diversion rates, and maximize billable hours.
*   **High Support & Follow-Up Program**. Patients with higher SDOH profiles are escalated to specialist navigators, to reduce repeat ER visits and protect case-rate revenue during the warranty period.
*   **Pharmacy Coordination & Medication Safety**. Phase 1 - built the workflows, dashboards, and documentation needed to prevent medication errors; Phase 2 - will automate these processes so they can scale.

## Slide 19: Care Team Operations

# Care Team Operations

## What's Next
*   **Adding APPs in the Care Team.** We will experiment with an APP in the Care Team to increase physician efficiency and lower patient care cost per episode Cost savings will come from: (1) starting episodes more quickly during high-volume periods, which avoids backup physician activation; and (2) shifting appropriate tasks from physicians to the APP, making the physician available sooner for the next call.
*   **Staffing and Volume Planning.** We are building staffing models for 4 large agencies scheduled to go live in '26: Gwinnett, Austin, El Paso, and Dallas. We are also building staffing models to start 7-day coverage when we begin generating gross profit.
*   **Grady Dispatch In-House Liaison Model (Possible Future Large Agency Strategy).** We are testing an embedded RightSite account manager in Grady's dispatch center to increase call volume. What we learn from this pilot will tell us whether an embedded account manager can reliably increase call volume and so make it a standard for large dispatch centers.

## What's Next (con't)
*   **Data & Accuracy Improvements.** We will continue to improve first-touch capture of SSNs, insurance, and demographics to prevent billing delays, and automate more documentation to ensure cleaner billing and more accurate reporting. We are reducing unnecessary physician backup activations by reviewing daily call patterns and using EMS agency data to improve our call volume forecasts and staffing plans. We are also running weekly audits of insurance checks, coding quality, follow-up completion, and diversion documentation to find the next set of improvements.
*   **Care Team and EMS Implementation and A/M.** We are tightening how Care Team Operations and EMS Sales, Implementation, and Account Management work together so EMS partners experience one clear, continuous path, from the first meeting through daily operations. Teams will use more consistent messaging, shared metrics, and regular feedback loops. We are also improving volume forecasting and EMS call-volume performance tracking, and tightening handoffs across sales, implementation, account management, and Care Team operations so EMS partners experience a coordinated, predictable operating model.

## Slide 20: Care Team Operations

# Care Team Operations

## Challenges
**Georgia Licensing Backlog**
State agency processing, slowed by the federal shutdown, created a 4-month delay, blocking a scheduled physician hire and forcing otherwise avoidable physician coverage gaps.

**CMS "Home Address" Rule for Virtual Clinicians**
CMS now requires fully remote clinicians to list their home addresses as their practice locations. This creates recruiting and retention risk for our doctors who are unwilling to comply with this highly controversial new CMS rule.

**Forecasting Uncertainty with New EMS Agencies**
4 large EMS agencies may come online in ‘26. Call volume expectations have not always aligned with actual performance, making physician and navigator scheduling difficult as we balance our on-demand EMS brand promise with the financial and performance risk of overstaffing or understaffing.

## Slide 22: Engineering

# Engineering

## What Happened
*   We have continued to focus specifically on user accuracy and efficiency to help drive business scale. We are listening closely to our Care Team and working to deliver features that improve their experience and that of the patients.
*   Completed our migration from Mode to Sigma Computing for a more robust and capable reporting platform.
*   Deployed a deeper integration with Dialpad for access to real-time user status and call events, for various purposes, including automated call transcription with sentiment analysis.
*   Implemented several new user efficiency improvements, including a more robust prescription assistance workflow, a customized intake workflow for Dispatch customers, new and improved activity alerts, and email notifications for new activities.
*   Improved our billing capabilities in several ways, including new automated insurance identification rules, custom telehealth modifiers for some payors, and new clinical coding fields for additional billing opportunities.
*   Completed an overhaul of how physicians are assigned to episodes to support greater call volume and multiple on-call physicians.

## What's Next
*   Deploy AI classification of audio calls, the ability to assign calls to episodes, and ultimately AI generation of clinical notes for audio-only calls.
*   Create role-specific dashboards, starting with one for the on-call physicians to help guide their workflow and improve efficiency.
*   Continue to identify areas for AI efficiency gains and deploy proof of concept solutions.
*   Improve reliability and uptime of San Antonio office power and internet infrastructure.
*   Prepare to implement the scaling up plan when the business is ready.

## Challenges
*   The technical infrastructure (specifically power and internet) in the San Antonio office is not quite up to par for a dedicated call center. We need to review some additional technical solutions and create a more robust environment.
*   We continue to experience some reliability issues with Dialpad, and may need to prioritize evaluation of alternative solutions.
*   The transition to being open 7 days a week will require technical support on weekends, which could be a tricky position to hire.

## What's Next
*   **Scaling Talent Growth:** Recruit and staff that activates as key financial milestones are achieved.
*   **High-Volume Onboarding Engine:** Build a scalable, streamlined onboarding program to ensure new hires are prepared and productive faster as we scale.
*   **Strategic Benefits Renewal:** Lead a successful Open Enrollment that meets both business needs and employee expectations while managing cost pressures in today's healthcare environment.
*   **Rollout Performance: Comp Evaluation Model:** We'll now run quarterly the Gary-inspired performance-compensation scorecard linking work performance, pay, and equity.

## Challenges
*   **HR Capacity** – Scaling without the right HR team and process risks bottlenecks in recruiting, onboarding, and culture.
*   **Role Specialization** – As the business matures, roles naturally become more specialized, requiring sharper definitions, clearer expectations, and more structured pathways.
*   **Sustaining Culture** – With 60+ employees spread across multiple cities (and growing), intentionally nurturing engagement, connection, and communication becomes more challenging.

## Slide 27: Notes on 2026 Budget

# Notes on 2026 Budget

For 2026, our central challenge is balancing accelerating EMS volume with the unpredictability of the payor sales cycles. Our accelerating traction with certain key payors in the 4Q:25 should set us up for some key contract additions in 1H:26. Seeing how the increased EMS penetration in Texas is propelling payors to contract with us, we have focused our 2026 budget on increasing EMS penetration in TX and GA.

While the key payor contracts (BCBS TX & GA and United TX) are instrumental to obtaining GP profitability, we want to manage the unpredictability of the payor cycle with EMS volume growth. The EMS sales team is in advanced contracting discussions with Austin, Dallas, El Paso agencies in TX and Gwinnett in GA. We have intentionally paced the rollout of these four large agencies across Q2–Q4 2026 to manage operational risk and preserve financial discipline.

We have used conservative implementation dates to allow time for United GA, Cigna, Superior, Oscar, and Aetna to come online, protecting the GP profitability target. As discussed earlier, these are currently modeled in the first 5 months of 2026. We are confident that we can accelerate EMS implementations across the EMS pipeline, assuming the payor contracts line up.

Additionally, we are planning on the next phase of activation growth by instituting 16-hour/day weekend coverage for all EMS agencies. Again, the need to ensure steady EMS volume with payor coverage is yet another teeter-totter compounded with the requisite increased Care Team staffing. We are currently targeting a soft date of August 1 for weekends, but this will be dependent on the key metrics that get us to GP profitability.

All of this needs to be balanced with our number one priority: cash. Hiring will be thoughtful with a focus on revenue-generating spend, combined with some needed G&A to support the activities.

We are currently at a $1.2M ARR and expect this to grow quickly in the 1H to $8M and $16M by Dec 2026. GP Profitability is modeled for April, but some payors need to cooperate to achieve this milestone.

We currently have $11M in cash and cash is projected to be at $2.4M in Dec 2026.

Net revenue / episode should increase based on volume and new payor contracts going live. Patient care costs / episode will continue to decline as volume increases resulting in the GP profitability target.

The second tab of the spreadsheet has the projection model overview to help guide you through the budget model.

## Slide 28: Notes on 2026 Budget

# Notes on 2026 Budget

## Activation Assumptions
*   Daily activations rise from 65 in December 2025 to 157 in December 2026, with a gradual increase in the 1H and stronger 2H. Soft planning for weekend go-live on Aug 1.
*   Systemwide diversion rate holds at 58%, consistent with 2025 actuals.
*   Florida is excluded from the model due to Jacksonville politics, allowing current payor and EMS cycles to focus on Texas and Georgia. A 2026 fast-follow payor and EMS reactivation in Florida would create upside beyond this model.

## Key Payor Assumptions
*   Execution expected in December 2025 across major plans.
*   BCBS Texas: Commercial and IFP lines of business with case rates of $1,000 to $1,200.
*   United Texas: Commercial, Medicare Advantage, and Managed Medicaid at $1,200, $1,000, and $800.
*   BCBS Georgia: Commercial, Medicare Advantage, and Managed Medicaid modeled at $1,200, $1,000, and $800.
*   United GA, Oscar, Cigna, Superior (TX) and Aetna are modeled for 1H 2026 based on current interactions

## Key Texas EMS Assumptions
*   Texas growth centers on large MSAs with strong adoption interest.
*   Austin, Dallas, and El Paso have requested contracts, moving through the approval process with implementations from Q2-Q4 2026.
*   Sales capacity remains a constraint, and more than half of the EMS pipeline is not yet being worked.
*   Initial daily activation assumptions: Austin at 13, Dallas at 30, and El Paso at 6.

## Georgia EMS Assumptions
*   Gwinnett County and Cherokee County, both in the Atlanta MSA, are moving through contracting with implementation in early Q2 2026.
*   Initial daily activation assumptions: Gwinnett at 10 and Cherokee at 4.

# Notes on 2026 Budget

## Headcount
*   EMS -VP Account Management
*   EMS – Sales heads and account management in TX and GA, Dispatch support, and inside sales
*   Payor sales-Partner success
*   Care Team-navigators increase as activation scales from 21 to 41 by Dec 2026 along with 2 manger level additions
*   Care Team-evaluating physician / APP / RN strategy to continue reducing cost of care
*   Care Team-navigators increase as activation scales from 21 to 41 by Dec 2026 along with 2 manager level additions
*   G&A - Scale infrastructure carefully as profitability allows

## What is not in the 2026 Budget
*   Florida call volume and payors are not included—a 2026 fast-follow payor and EMS reactivation in Florida would create upside beyond this model.
*   No volume for hospital walk-in service line
*   Potential for moving weekends to earlier than Aug 1st. 40 activations per weekend day could add potentially $50k in GP with additional payor contracts
*   Any new expansion state
*   No new EMS growth in 2027 (2027 EMS call volume growth set at 5% of Dec '26)

## Slide 31: Appendix 2 - Payor Value Proposition Evolution

# Appendix 2

## Payor Value Proposition Evolution

Our payer value proposition has sharpened meaningfully.

We recently submitted a proposal to Optum and are sharing a short excerpt with the Board to illustrate the increased clarity in how we now describe our value.

We have included only the opening section of the proposal, which outlines the core service and value proposition. Pricing and line-item financial details are excluded, as they are not necessary to demonstrate this evolution.

Please see the attachment, “RightSite ER Diversion Service for United.20251208.pdf.”
