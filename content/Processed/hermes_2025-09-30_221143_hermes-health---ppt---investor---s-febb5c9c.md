## Slide 3: Identified Data is the Future

**Chart Data:**
This slide presents a concentric circle chart showing different categories of patient data and their market sizes.

| Data Category                   | Market Size (Billion) |
| :------------------------------ | :-------------------- |
| Patient Reported Outcomes       | $1B                   |

## Slide 4: Healthcare's Missing Link
The Missing Link
*   Healthcare has digitized storage (EHRs, claims, labs).
*   The industry is investing in analytics (AI, insights).
*   But identified data access & movement is broken and trapped in silos, faxes, and manual workflows

Data Silos → ? → Analytics

The Solution
*   Hermes is building the rails for identified health data movement and access.
    *   Visa for payments
    *   Plaid for banking
    *   Twilio for communications.

## Slide 7: Hermes Health – Contrarian Views
Contrarian Views
*   Neutrality is the MOAT. Neutrality is our Superpower.
*   Fragmentation is the opportunity, not a barrier.
*   Scale comes through intermediaries, not end-customers.
*   Network effects matter more than proprietary tech.
*   Identified data is a bigger market than de-identified data.

The market obsessed with data ownership and closed ecosystems, Hermes Health's neutrality and infrastructure-first approach make it the only player positioned to become indispensable middleware—the “Stripe” or “Plaid” of identified patient health data.

23

## Slide 24: Partners Can't Be The Center
Why Can't Partners Be The Center
*   **Competitive Conflict:** Partners compete with each other, making it difficult for any single partner to act as a neutral hub for all.
*   **Limited Footprint:** Individual partners have a limited footprint on a patient data record. As a result they cannot fulfill all requests.
*   **Trust:** Partners don't trust each other and as a result hesitate to share proprietary information directly with each other, restricting cooperation.
*   **Complex Integration:** Direct connections among multiple partners create costly complexity, duplication, and labor.

**Image Description:** An illustration of several cartoon people with angry or suspicious expressions looking at each other, emphasizing conflict and mistrust.

## Slide 25: Flywheel and Moat
Two-Sided Marketplace
Hermes Health connects Requestors with Partners creating value for both sides:

*   **Partners Benefit Via:**
    *   Increased Requests from Requestors increases Vendors revenue.
    *   Reduced fulfillment costs by switching Requestors to electronic submission and delivery
*   **Requestors Benefit Via:**
    *   Simplified record submission and delivery increasing, enabling increased demand for more requests
    *   Improved turnaround times

**Diagram: Hermes Health Flywheel Effect**

*   **More Requestors** (Top right, icon of three people)
    *   Leads to **Faster and Easier Records** (Top left, icon of document)
*   **Faster and Easier Records**
    *   Leads to **More Vendors Integrate to Capture Volume** (Bottom left, icon of gear with network nodes)
*   **More Vendors Integrate to Capture Volume**
    *   Leads to **More Record Volume** (Bottom right, icon of stacked documents)
*   **More Record Volume**
    *   Leads to **More Requestors**

This cycle is labeled **Hermes Health Flywheel Effect** in the center.

## Slide 26: The Business

## Slide 27: Simple, Aligned Economics
Simple Pricing
*   Hermes Health monetizes the Requestors
*   Hermes Health pays the Partner on a per record or patient basis based on the dataset.
*   Margin comes from the spread between what we charge the Requestors vs what the Partners charge us.
*   60% to 50% margins for each product line.

**Table: Pricing Model**

| Category                        | Price                    |

## Slide 34: Step 1: HIPAA Checker
Problem: Incomplete HIPAA Authorizations
*   Customer-submitted HIPAA Authorizations are frequently missing key elements required by providers.
*   These deficiencies lead to denials — wasting time and money, with feedback loops often exceeding 20 days.

Solution: HIPAA Auth Checker
*   Automatically reviews HIPAA Authorizations for 10 compliance gaps.
*   Flags missing or invalid components and suggests precise corrections to ensure provider acceptance.

## Slide 35: Step 2: Site Sonar
Problem: Bad Site Information
*   Patients often cannot recall or accurately name the site details where they received care
*   Medical canvassing is time-consuming and expensive.

Solution: Site Sonar
*   Site Sonar uses a patient's PII and our Partner Network to automatically find care sites a patient has visited. Output includes:
    *   Facility Name
    *   Address
    *   Speciality
    *   Date

**Table: Site Sonar Output Example**

## Slide 36: Step 3: Site Finder
Problem: Messy Facility Data
*   Customer-submitted facility details are messy and inconsistent
*   Manually identifying the correct metadata such as release of information vendor, location, fax, ect

Solution: Site Finder
*   Automatically cleans and standardizes facility address
*   Cross-references with Hermes national Site List. If matched, intelligently outputs the corresponding site meta data:
    *   Release of information vendor
    *   Fax
    *   ect.....

*   **NSRC Ochsner Health Center - South Tyler (#390)**
    *   **Basic Information**
        *   Site Name: NSRC Ochsner Health Center - South Tyler (#390)
        *   System Name: Ochsner Health System (#157)
        *   ROI Vendor: MRO
    *   **Location**
        *   Address: 1203 S Tyler St, Covington, LA 70433, USA
        *   Formatted Address: 1203 S Tyler St, Covington, LA 70433, USA
    *   **Contact Information**
        *   Main Phone: Not provided
    *   **Records Department**
        *   Records Phone: Not provided
        *   Records Fax: Not provided
        *   Records Website: Not provided
*   **Match Reason:**
    Both facilities are located at 1203 S. Tyler St., Covington, LA 70433, and are associated with Ochsner Health. The first facility is listed as "Ochsner Health 1203 S Tyler St, Covington, LA 70433, USA," which corresponds to the address of Ochsner Health Center - South Tyler. ([ochsner.org](https://www.ochsner.org/locations/ochsner-health-center-south-tyler/?utm_source=openai)) The second facility, "Ochsner Health System (#157) NSRC Ochsner Health Center - South Tyler (#390) 1203 S Tyler St, Covington, LA 70433, USA," also matches this address and includes identifiers (#157) and (#390) that likely refer to internal designations within the Ochsner Health System. Given the identical addresses and association with Ochsner Health, it is highly likely that both facilities belong to the same health system.

## Slide 37: Step 4: Smart Router
Problem: Submission Disparity
*   Submitting records through the optimal submission path is complex:
    *   Fax
    *   ROI specific vendor portal
    *   Bespoke Integration

Solution: Smart Router
*   Hermes Health submits the record request on behalf of the customer by:
    *   Routing directly to its ROI Partners
    *   Faxing validated facilities using our efax service

**Image Description:** An icon showing network nodes connected to a document, symbolizing smart routing.

## Slide 38: Step 5: OCR & Text Extraction
Problem: Image Based Document
*   Sites often send documents back that are scanned image of text documents
*   These documents are thus hard to work with since they are not text based document

Solution: Text Extraction & OCR
*   **Text Extraction:** Extracts the raw text from the document allowing you to work with the underlying raw text.
*   **OCR:** Convert the image document into a text based PDF. It superimposes invisible ink over the tex making it searchable.

The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he said was, "Why is a raven like a writing-desk?"
"Come, we shall have some fun now!" thought Alice. "I'm glad they've begun ask-ing riddles -I believe I can guess that," she added aloud.
"Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?" said the March Hare. "Exactly so," said Alice.

## Slide 40: Simple Contractional Framework
Contracting & Liability
Hermes signs agreements with both the Requestor and the Partner.

*   **Requestors attest** that HIPAA Authorization submissions are valid and accurate.
*   **Partners attest:**
    *   That they have the right to release identified medical data assuming a valid HIPAA Authorization.
    *   That they are releasing the correct data for the patient requested
*   **Hermes Health attests** that patient data is securely handled and transmitted to the appropriate party.

**Diagram: Contractual Framework**

| Party         | Attestation                                           | Liability                                      |
| :------------ | :---------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------- |
| **Requestor** | Attest that HIPAA Authorizations are Valid and Accurate | Holds the Liability for Inappropriate Record Submissions |
| **Hermes Health** | Attest that Patient Data is Secured and transmitted to the appropriate party | Holds the Liability for Inappropriate Record Disclosures |
| **Partner**   | Attest that Records released are for the patient requested | Holds the Liability for Inappropriate Disclosure |

## Slide 41: Solution: How it Works
First Neutral API for Identified Health Data
The Hermes Health Unity Platform connects Requestors to a growing network of Partners—including ROI vendors, EHR systems, and RWD providers. How it works:

*   **Secure Intake:** Requestors securely submit patient's full name, date of birth, and a signed HIPAA Authorization form.
*   **Smart Routing:** The Unity Platform then routes these requests to our network of Partners.
*   **Partner Fulfillment:** Our Partner networks processes these Requests and securely transmits identified patient data back to the Unity Platform.
*   **Delivery:** The Unity Platform securely delivers the data back to requestors without revealing Partner-specific infrastructure or exposing individual Partner details, protecting privacy, and confidentiality
*   **Transparent Pricing:** Each Partner is paid a clear, per-record/patient fee to keep pricing simple and aligned.

**Diagram: Solution Flow**
