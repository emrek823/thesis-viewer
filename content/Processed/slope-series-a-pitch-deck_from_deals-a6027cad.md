## Slide 1: Slope: We make clinical trials boring.

WWW.SLOPE.IO

**SLOPE**

We make clinical trials **boring.**

**I'm Rust Felix, co-founder and CEO of Slope.**
**Let's talk → rust@slope.io**

## Slide 2: Clinical Trial Delays

80% of clinical trials are at least **a month behind schedule**,
costing sponsors **millions** each day a study is delayed.

**(Image shows multiple calendar pages from January to May 2021 with many dates marked with a red 'X', indicating delays. Specific events like "SITE INITIATION VISIT" and "PATIENT ENROLLMENT" are shown rescheduled or delayed.)**

*   **January 2021**
    *   SITE INITIATION VISIT (Date 3, originally 26)
    *   RESCHEDULE (Date 10)
    *   FIRST PATIENT IN (Date 17)
*   **February 2021**
    *   SITE INITIATION VISIT (Date 8, originally 26)
    *   RESCHEDULE (Date 15)
*   **March 2021**
    *   Mar 1 (marked with X)
    *   (Many other dates marked with X)
*   **April 2021**
    *   PATIENT ENROLLMENT DELAYED (Date 3, originally 26)
*   **May 2021**
    *   PATIENT ENROLLMENT RESCHEDULE (Date 10, originally 26)
    *   SITE INITIATION VISIT (Date 5)

## Slide 3: Complexity of Clinical Trials

Sponsors depend on **project managers armed with spreadsheets** to **manually coordinate** stakeholders, assets, and activities — all critical to study success.

**(Image shows a stack of spreadsheets, with different colored lines connecting parts of the spreadsheets to categories of Assets, Stakeholders, and Activities.)**

**ASSETS**
*   Samples
*   Drugs
*   Devices
*   Equipment
*   Lab Kits
*   Shippers

**STAKEHOLDERS**
*   Sponsors
*   Sites
*   Patients
*   CROs
*   Vendors
*   Labs

**ACTIVITIES**
*   Sample Routing
*   Procurement
*   Chain of Custody
*   Supply Chain Mgmt
*   Direct-to-Patient Shipments
*   Sample Collection
*   Vendor Mgmt
*   Inventory Mgmt

## Slide 4: Modern Study Designs

Modern study designs are
increasingly complex,
requiring **up to 70% more**
**samples** to generate results.

**(Image shows two stacks of "Clinical Trial Protocol" documents and two bar charts comparing "THE WAY IT USED TO BE" vs. "THE WAY IT IS NOW".)**

**THE WAY IT USED TO BE**
*   SAMPLES: [Green bar, ~70%]
*   LAB KITS: [Green bar, ~70%]
*   DRUGS: [Green bar, ~70%]

**THE WAY IT IS NOW**
*   SAMPLES: [Red bar, ~100%]
*   LAB KITS: [Red bar, ~100%]
*   DRUGS: [Red bar, ~100%]

Overwhelming operational friction delays
research, threatening clinical data integrity.

## Slide 7: Slope's Solution

Slope automates and orchestrates operationally
intensive studies by connecting everyone and everything.

**(Diagram shows "Clinical Trial Protocol" on the left transforming into "SLOPE" in the center, which then connects to "Sponsors", "CROs", "Patients", "Sites", "Labs" at the top, and "Drug", "Devices", "Lab Kits", "Samples", "Equipment" at the bottom. On the right, a laptop screen displays a "SLOPE" interface with "Clinical Study CS123".)**

*   **Clinical Trial Protocol**
    *   Study documents transform into structured workflows.

*   **Top Connections (People/Organizations):**
    *   Sponsors
    *   CROs
    *   Patients
    *   Sites
    *   Labs

*   **Bottom Connections (Assets):**
    *   Drug
    *   Devices
    *   Lab Kits
    *   Samples
    *   Equipment

*   **Laptop Display:**
    *   Real-time visibility drives chain of custody for everything.

## Slide 8: Traction

We've closed **$4M+ in contracts**,
and have **33 trials in the pipeline.**

*   **$628k**
    average total contract value
    across **seven Phase I/II trials.**

*   **10wk**
    average sales cycle for
    our **three sponsor clients.**

*   **30k+**
    managed drugs, kits, & samples
    with traceable chain of custody.

## Slide 11: Site Network & Moat

Our **free solution for sites** builds our moat while helping
thousands of researchers prepare for their patients.

**(Image shows a schematic drawing of a multi-level warehouse/storage facility with various clinical trial assets like devices, lab kits, drugs, and samples stored on shelves.)**

*   **DEVICES**
*   **LAB KITS**
*   **SAMPLES**
*   **DRUGS**

Slope's active site network proves to sponsors
that we capture real-time operational data more
effectively than their spreadsheet models.

*   **483k**
    drugs, devices, kits, & samples
    managed by sites on our platform.

*   **581**
    global research sites; 175%
    annual site network growth.

*   **5,262**
    clinical trials managed by
    sites using our platform.

*   **Owning sites drives**
    **sponsor lock-in.** (Padlock icon)

## Slide 12: Target Market

Sponsors who use Slope **don't need traditional, full-service CROs** for their Phase I / II studies.

*   Our ideal client is a sponsor running early-phase clinical trials within the United States.

*   We accommodate decentralized study designs, clinical systems integrations, and rescue studies.

*   We replace the need for traditional, full-service CROs to manage clinical operations for these studies.

*   **$** We sell to Directors and VPs of Clinical Operations, who typically act as both decision maker and buyer.

*   We prioritize sponsors with recent investor funding, oncology studies, and procedurally intensive protocols.

*   We team with select specialty CROs and clinical trial vendors who serve as channel partners.
