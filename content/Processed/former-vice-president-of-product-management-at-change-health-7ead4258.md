## Client
Hey there. Thank you for taking the time. Let me just give you some context as to why I'm doing this call and would be great to just have a quick one-minute intro from your side. What I'm trying to understand is essentially, one key question is understanding the urgency in the payer market for prior authorization.

## Expert Background
**Expert**
Yeah, sure. I'm currently the vice president of product for data and AI at Global Healthcare Exchange. We're a healthcare supply chain automation company. Prior to working here, I worked at a start-up in Change Healthcare and Optum, working on applications of AI and machine learning to prior authorization culminating with me running the InterQual business unit and the UHG enterprise clinical AI strategy for prior auth.

## Client Inquiry
**Client**
Have you been on the buyer side as well or is this all-product management at actually selling the solutions?

**Expert**
A little bit of both because UHG as both UnitedHealthcare, who's a client for a customer, plus I was a vendor selling to them and their competitors. It was a weird dynamic. I've seen how does MindShift, how does Itiliti, how does MCG, etc. position, etc.?

**Client**
Just bluntly checking, you would be able to speak to the buying cycles because my questions are all for someone who would actually make the decision at the payer side.

**Expert**
Yep, 100%.

## Buying Cycle Discussion
**Client**
I think the first question is what is the payer buying cycle like for such AI-driven prior auth solutions looking like right now? How many months? Is it a year? Is it nine months? What's happening right now at the moment?

**Expert**
When you on the health plan side decide to procure technology, depending on when your fiscal year is, best case scenario, your buying cycle is nine months. Medium case scenario it's 18-24 months. Very commonly it's 36+ months depending on where you are in the adoption cycle. Very slow procurement.

**Client**
When you say procurement, what part of this is the decision making and then the actual procurement timeline? Does it take 36 months sometimes when you evaluate?

**Expert**
Yes, because it depends on where you hit in the fiscal year, when you start your sales cycle, how much it costs? Obviously, the bigger the cost if it goes up to a board level procurement, like you have to get through your procurement first, get the approval and assuming you hit the right site, the right timing and budget, and then it goes to the board for approval. That's typically only for $10+ million in software solutions, sometimes $50 million. It depends on the size of the health plan. Let's put it this way, if you're trying to sell to UnitedHealthcare and you want to get $10 million-$30 million out of them, it's a board level approval.

**Client**
I believe payers as big as UnitedHealthcare or the size like Optum would not actually be doing prior authorization through external vendors. I'm guessing they're doing it in house.

**Expert**
It's a blend. It depends on the service line. For UnitedHealthcare, diagnostic radiology is outsourced to...

# Document Content

EviCore, cardiovascular and oncology is outsourced to Optum, general medical spend, so inpatient admissions is done in house. Most ambulatory, most lab is done in house. It depends on the service line and also by the line of business. The way you sell is you're going to go sell to a line of business, sometimes at a state level.

If you're going after a Medicaid plan, let's just take Centene for a minute because they're pretty much all Medicaid, you have to go hand to hand combat at each of the states to get your economic buyer to purchase. If enough states get together and select the same solution or corporate IT at Centene decides they're going to make an enterprise procurement, then it comes top down. This is why buying cycles can take years.

## Client
What about players like Cohere or Anterior that are doing this entirely by AI? I'm guessing those are not your primary, like a United would not depend on them for their ambulatory care. That will always be for a particular business line or not at all. They'll do it in house. What is your thought process? Am I right or am I wrong?

## Expert
You're wrong. I'm sorry, that came off way more obnoxious than I meant it to. Let's just take United for a minute. You've got the commercial line of business, you have the Medicaid line of business, and you have the Medicare Advantage line of business. They technically have self-pay, but ignore them for a minute.

You have those three lines of business. Those three lines of business exist at every state that United competes in, which just to keep the math simple, let's call it 30 states. There's 90 distinct sales cycles you can have for a product. Does Cohere have footprint within United? Yes. Does it have footprint at United corporate or all 90 combinations of products and lines of business? No. You can go to United and they can be using every single vendor.

It's actually a very common strategy for the top 10 or 15 health plans where they'll basically have a bake off with all the vendors and pick different regions and see which one performs best. Another reason why procurement can take so long, because you'll procure solutions at the state levels, you'll do the bake off for a year or two and then you'll decide if anyone's actually that good, then you may try and centralize a buying decision, but then you have to wait for the next capital cycle. That makes sense?

## Client
It's not like they wouldn't go for a smaller player. They might for a particular state, for a particular line of business and then assess whether they want to expand or not.

## Expert
The only counterpoint to that is you can see acceleration on the start-up side in terms of penetration through the venture capital arm of most of these major health plans. If you go to Optum Ventures and Optum Ventures takes a position in a start-up, they will have faster sales cycles than if they're coming in alone. It's still not that much faster.

## Client
It's not like we were trying to compare it to say, the AI scribing market. It just was taken so quickly last year. Any player who would have waited for another couple of months to actually perfect their solution would have really lost in a big jump of the market. We were trying to see is that a vibe of FOMO, a fear of missing out or a major buying spree going on for AI-driven prior auth solutions in the payer market or that's not the case?

## Expert
The market dynamics are a little different and I know the ambient space very well. By the way, this will help juxtapose the two things. If you look at the ambient documentation segment and let's just care about Ambience, Abridge, and Microsoft/Nuance is the big three and there's a whole bunch of little podunk players. You have 300 accounts in the IDN segment. IDN plus big ambulatory group, 350 total count.

That's going to be 60% of your wallet share in terms of dollars, so 350 accounts. What we see in the ambient documentation market is at this point around 70% have picked a vendor to work with. This is why it's really important, the way the business model works, and it's not dissimilar from United or a big health plan is you pay by NPI.

There are very few health systems that have actually rolled out all of the NPI counts for that vendor because they're doing pilots, they're doing limited expansion, etc. Just because you signed on for a vendor, that vendor has "first mover advantage" in that account. Until the NPIs are all activated, it's not over.

## Client
Can you explain NPI? What is that?

## Expert
The way the billing works for ambient documentation, you pay a certain amount per month per doctor. If you go there for a minute just to use round numbers, that account is worth a big amount. You look at the bookings for Abridge, you look at the ARR, I think it’s fairly low.

## Client
They haven't reached out to the majority of the providers yet.

## Expert
There's a myth, and we see this in a lot of the AI segments. I came from autonomous medical coding, which is mid-rev cycle on the provider, 50% or 60% of provider institutions had picked a vendor to start working with, but less than 10% of the total penetration had occurred. What you're seeing in health plans and what makes health plans different is when you look at it from a covered life perspective. Your top 15 health plans are 65% of the covered ones.

If you actually think about the health plans as the way you think about NPIs on ambient, like Itiliti and they're more on the provider side when I'm seeing them. If you look at MCG and InterQual, they may have an account. I'm using air quotes. How many lines of business, how many offs are actually flowing through it? What this means is it's still incredibly early innings for all these players. Even though you've made a vendor selection because you see a mismatch in the car to R basically, implying rollout, that means that the tech isn't ready. If the tech were ready, car and R would be one to one or there'd be a slight lag. Does that make sense?

## Client
You're saying that while payers are interested to consider these vendors, the vendors' tech is not there yet. The rollout is much slower. Of course it seems on the top of it that they're super interested. A lot of payers are actually willing to shell out a big part of their share of wallet for this. It's not like they actually have the market. They're mostly doing pilots right now, early in the rollout stage. Is that right?

## Expert
Correct. If you look at Cohere, they only support really one line of business, musculoskeletal. Their biggest customer is Humana. Regarding your question about do you go-to-market, do you stay? This cuts to the chase and this is probably bad for my hourly rate, at least, you should go-to-market because your buying cycle is going to take freaking forever.

## Client
You're saying we keep developing.

## Expert
You have to keep building because what's important about, when I've done such work before, when you look at a market cycle in health tech on the provider side, from first proof of concept to about 70% penetration of

## Transcript

**Expert:** Revenue is usually around 11, 12 years. There's also conveniently the 10- to 11-year mark is the median exit date of a start-up in health, on the provider segment.

Health plans move slower than providers because it's more consolidated and if you think providers are bad at IT, health plans really give them a run for their money. They're even worse. It's like 15-ish years to hit 70% penetration. Candidly, the first proofs of concept in this stuff popped up right around the pandemic. This market won't be closed or done until 2035, assuming the tech works.

Back to your question of, is there FOMO? No, not really. Do you need to go in and start getting customers because of how freaking long the buying cycles are? Yeah. In your segment and what you will also find is, this is a counterintuitive go-to-market strategy, if you go to smaller health plans which obviously have a smaller TAM as a segment, so basically 150,000 lives and below, their buying cycles are faster.

They tend to be cash poor, though it's a good place as a start-up and I've done some advising in this space where I'm like, go after the community health plan so at least you can get started. The problem is your proof points for community health plan mean nothing to UnitedHealthcare. All it does is allow you to get to the regional blues plans or the health plans that are 150,000 covered lives to 500,000. You've got to basically work your way up to the jumbos. That makes sense?

**Client:** Can you dive deeper into what you just said for the smaller health plans? Help me understand, is the urgency more because they take decisions faster? Is that what you meant?

**Expert:** Their urgency to buy isn't necessarily more. Their ability to move faster than two to five years is much higher. Let's take Blue Cross Vermont for a minute. They've got 500,000 covered lives, give or take. It's much easier for an AI start-up to go sell to Blues Vermont than it is to sell to United. If you think about United which has got like 30 million covered lives, it's got 60X-600X as many as Blue Cross Vermont.

It's just faster. It's a less complex IT system. The trade off becomes your proof points at that segment of the market are only relevant to the segment slightly above it. If you take Blues Michigan for a minute, which is around one million covered lives. If you could do Blues Vermont, Blues Michigan would take a bet on you. If you could do Blues Vermont, UnitedHealthcare, Cigna, Elevance, HCSC doesn't give a shit.

**Client:** Let’s look at this market, the medium-sized player, the Blues. For them, you're saying I understand the point that they will take a decision faster and I know they're short on budget. Do you feel like it's a new year, 2025 has just started, they're entering Q2, they would have extra budget and they would have a mandate from their leadership to spend on AI solutions, like what we saw for scribing or that's not the case? It's not like if they don't launch in Q2 and if they wait until Q3, they will really lose out.

**Expert:** If they wait until Q3, they will be fine. Nothing's really going to change because most health plans do calendar year budgeting, so their budget's locked already. Hence, to my statement of best case scenario, you come in right now, they'll probably start the capital budgeting cycle in July and wrap it up in October, give or take to finalize it and then implement on January one.

Best case scenario, if you start today, you might nab a small health plan or two this year. It's pretty unlikely, but you'll at least be in funnel for next year. If you wait until Q3, you're still in the funnel for next year. From a go-to-market perspective, it doesn't make a big difference because you've missed the fiscal year budgeting cycle for this year.

Now you're trying to get into next year and see what the capital release looks like. In terms of where health plans put their money, the challenge that you'll find in the small to mid-size, they're capital constrained. They're going to be focused on regulatory requirements for prior auth before they start dealing with AI and automation. There's a bunch of regs that are going to effect for CMS 57 on January 1st of next year.

# Client-Expert Discussion on Prior Authorization Process

## Client
What does that change exactly? Can you give me more on that?

## Expert
We take the before or we take the current state, prior authorization occurs. A user in the provider organization will log into a portal in the health plan, identify the member or put in a request for a service, let's just say a CT of a head for a minute, interact with some clinical questions, and then upload any relevant documentation to support those clinical questions and hit submit. That is the prior auth process today as we know. Make sense.

Now the issue with that is providers freaking hate it because they have to log into X number of portals where X is the number of health plans and their relevant benefits managers that map onto the members/patients. It's a big freaking pain in the neck on the provider.

There's regulation that went into law called CMS 57 which said that entire business process, you do it as a health plan in their portal must be converted into APIs, and the intent of this is to shift that entire process away from X number of payer portals and put it into one EHR RCM system. At least the provider doesn't have to leave their system to submit the prior law. Does that make sense?

## Client
Right now, they're logging into 20 different systems for each health plan. Next year onwards, they'll have it in Epic or whatever they're using, or at least their RCM system, Athena etc., and be able to see it in one place.

## Expert
That'll probably happen in 2027, but right now the requirement is for the payers to make all those APIs turned on by January 1st, 2026. I bet the reg is going to get kicked back because nobody's ready. I worked on the SPAC when I was at United and for InterQual because we're a core component of making that API stack work and nobody was ready full stop. Either January one, 2026 will go into effect and everyone will look around and shrug and say we tried and the government will give up or they'll kick the can down the road.

## Client
Do you think payers will want to wait until this is kicked in to actually find a prior auth vendor?

## Expert
It will complicate at the small to mid-sized plans, their buying cycles because they're focused on compliance first, value second. The issue is going to be if you're not ready to solve this problem this year, which pretty much nobody is, and you're going to get an extension on your homework for next year or the year after, you still got to do all that work you couldn't get done this year.

This is going to tie back to your capital budgeting cycle. There's money laying around for innovation pilots. By the way, there's people behind Cohere. It's not all AI. Their marketing's really good. I used to know their SVP of marketing. He worked for me actually. Is your solution like a technology widget that bolts onto the health plan or is an actual service like an EviCore?

## Client
It's a technology.

## Expert
On the tech side, have you figured out your utilization management partner strategy?

## Client
That's also ongoing on the side and we're trying to figure out again, in house versus do we buy someone? Do we partner? That's another decision going on.

# Expert Discussion on Health Plans and UM Systems

## Expert Insights
Yeah. By the way, this is something for you to keep in mind, which is when you get to the top 10 health plans by the Blue Cross basically or the big guys, they all effectively have custom/proprietary UM systems. If you want to take your solution and go to United, you're going to have to integrate into their UM system which is proprietary. I worked on it when I was there.

If you go to Blues Nebraska, they buy an off-the-shelf solution. The problem is there's like 15 vendors to pick from and they all kind of suck. It'll be a challenge. By the way, I think it is a very prudent strategy to do inorganic growth to buy the UM capability because it is the front door for this process. It's a tough market because it's so fragmented. It's a very good decision for what it's worth.

## Client Inquiry
Makes sense. I'm trying to think, I do have some other questions but maybe they're covered. Let me see. In terms of the cycle, let's say of course the buying cycle you explained is nine months. What is the switching like if they do choose to launch in Q3 or take their time and maybe towards second half or end of Q3, they might have lost some contracts that could have been used from this year's budget? What's the switching cycle like? Especially given these AI solutions and more tech first and not as difficult to switch from.

## Expert Response
The short answer is the switch is going to coincide with the contract duration. Our standard agreement is three years for a SaaS solution in the payer side. They'll lock in that vendor for three years. Now keep in mind, most of these lock-ins are pilots. If you go to Blues Vermont for a minute, they're going to pick a vendor, that vendor is locked in for three years. He can't go to that account for three years.

You go to Cigna or you go to Centene, there's freaking 50 of them. Centene New Mexico may pick somebody but you can go knock on Centene New Jersey's door. This is why the segmentation gets tricky because the fastest places you can go, they're easy to lock up. They're also cheap and you don't get the proof points. This is why it takes so long for tech diffusion to occur in the health plan.

## Client Follow-Up
In terms of the competition, of course there's the cycle and there's the switching, but where do you think the competition is right now? I know there's Cohere, there's Availity, there's EviCore, there's Anterior, but what do you think is happening? How much scope is there?

## Expert Analysis
I'm going to answer that question in a few different ways. Remember I said that there are these three core jobs in prior authorization coverage. Is a prior auth required? Yes or no, clinical rules and then supporting documentation and submission. When you look at those vendors, every vendor is picking one of those three jobs to be done and focusing on it. Availity is disproportionately focused on job three and a little bit on job one.

Here's the reason why. When you look at job two, the clinical questionnaires, there's two vendors that represent 80% of the clinical questionnaires, MCG, a.k.a Milliman and InterQual. You can't do all three without playing ball with those two. Those two vendors can't do jobs one and three. It's impossible. We don't own the footprint of software, which is why you see Availity with their partnership with MCG trying to thread this back together.

Change Healthcare was one of the few vendors who could do all three because it owned both a clearinghouse and the middle piece of intellectual property. Ignore that for a second. When you look at a Waystar or an Availity and maybe even Experian. They can focus on jobs one and three. You have to partner for job two. If you partner for job two and if you look at the vendors who do job two.

There's two approaches. You either try and buy the AI from MCG and InterQual, which neither of them have executed particularly well, or you find a different vendor, like an Anterior. They used to be Co:Helm. Trying to remember which way it was. Anyway, you have an Anterior Co:Helm or a MindShift or a Cohere is a slightly different twist on this. They're focused on job two. They're more a direct competitor to MCG and InterQual.

than they are to Waystar and Availity. Really you would see a partnership strategy because unless you own job two, you're going to have to partner with the vendors who do job two.

This is where the UM vendors get all super interesting because this API for CMS 57, the front door to that API is the utilization management system. There's a theory in the market, at least this is what my belief was, is that you might be able to circumvent InterQual and MCG and go straight to the UM system to try and basically own the entire front door to the auth process.

By the way, there's also other aspects of this that focus on the provider segmentation. That's where you see Itiliti and MindShift, doing more work and whatever's left of Rhyme. This is the whole landscape. The takeaway of it is it's super early innings. No one's come even close to solving this problem. If you think you're going to have a substantially better mousetrap in a quarter, wait a quarter.

Also, you're probably not going to close any deals if you start today anyway. Depending on what your risk tolerance is, start today by accident, you might sell something. Even if you do, they're not going to implement it until the turnover of the calendar year. It feel like, I don't know, you could do whatever you want. It doesn't make a difference from my perspective because they're just natural forces in the buying cycle, in the sales motion here.

**Client**
That's what they are trying to leverage. If the buying cycle is anyway long enough, they buy more time internally to make a more solid solution while of course, they do demand gen and try to start creating a market. That makes sense.

**Expert**
One thing to add on this. Let's say it takes nine to 36 months to procure the software. Your implementation date won't be until the subsequent calendar year because they do everything on the fiscals. Let's say you go and sell Blues Nebraska today. Praise God that you were able to close a deal in one day. They may start implementation today, which by the way, is also not going to happen, they won't go live and they generally won't start an implementation until the next fiscal year, which is why when you look at the rev rec timelines, your moment from demand gen to recurring rev can be three to four years.

This is AI, it's not like there's a separate budget for provider segments. We saw some health systems had a separate AI budget. Do you see that happening here? Do you think that might be something we might lose out if we don't go until later this year?

**Expert**
The person you need to sell is the chief medical officer. Now, whether the dollars are coming out of the CMO or the CIO doesn't make a difference. That's just an accounting question. The CMO is the one who signs up for the medical expense and he or she is the one who decides what utilization management vendor delegated benefits manager. That's the person who's going to authorize a prior authorization solution because they own that budget. Whether it's their dollars or the CIO doesn't really matter because they're going to sign up for the med ex reduction and the cost reductions.

**Client**
What do you see happening in the market over the next couple of years? How do you see this evolving? Clearly there's no one winner right now. We discussed, Cohere seems to be doing relatively better than the others. Again, that's because they're doing one specialty and their biggest customer is their investor.

**Expert**
It's a good recipe for the record. I'm a cynic, which is ironic because I've lived and breathed this problem for six years and I've worked in machine learning for clinical language. I think the problem might still be too hard to solve right now. What that means is the tech-centric solution, if you're taking a copilot approach, let's talk about actual product strategy for a minute.

If you're trying to do total automation without human in the loop, I think you're dead on arrival. If you're doing a copilot approach, it's much more likely that you'd be successful. That's why the UM system is such a critical asset in this because you need a surface area or a presentation layer to layer your copilot on. The copilots can probably get decent enough that we see productivity gains.

Let's call a spade a spade, when you're doing automation solutions, let's look at the unit economics. Let's take a CT of the head for the minute. It's a $2,000 study. It's probably going to cost the health plan about $100-$200 to authorize it, depending on whether there's an appeal and just a whole bunch of other factors. Let's call it $100. If your AI solution, if you see any adverse impact to med ex, whatever productivity gain you get is immediately erased. It's like if you authorize one CT by accident, then you have offset 20 offs worth of cost savings. Does that make sense?

**Client**
Even if you're not doing any denials, if you're only doing approvals or passing it on to a human for review, even then if you wrongly approve one CT, then it costs you a lot.

**Expert**
If you look at MSK for a minute where your average procedure price is $10,000-$25,000 a unit, the total automation route, it starts to fall apart. You end up with a human in the loop and the question at the end of the day becomes the average time in motion study for prior auth. On the health plan side, it basically ends up being $100 a minute give or take. It's a weird metric.

If you're doing a CT of the head, you'll probably do the prior auth review in five to 10 minutes depending on the documentation, a couple of other pieces. If you're doing an inpatient admission, it's half an hour per review. You're doing MSK, it's around 15 minutes of review. If you're doing oncology, it's one to two reviews per hour.

The question becomes your variable labor to do this is around $75 an hour because you're basically paying a nurse $50 an hour plus benefits gets him or her up to $65-ish. Throw in another $10-$20 for software as the full cost to perform that off. If you're doing five minutes and off for diagnostic radiology, that's actually high, six minutes makes more sense, $10 an hour. Your copilot has to shave off 50%+ of the time to win back $30 per hour per user. That makes sense. I know I went through a lot of numbers very quickly.

**Client**
I think I got the point. Clearly, we're not there yet. The point you were essentially making is the copilot approach also makes sense only when our model is really strong and we know when to raise it to the human and not even from an approval side approve where we have even an iota like a significant doubt.

**Expert**
You basically have to automate each off from a variable labor perspective by 40%+ in terms of a copilot experience for the ROI to really start to make sense.

**Client**
One more question, what do you think currently is the adoption rate for such AI-driven prior auth solutions among payers? Maybe you can split it by the top payers like the Humanas or the Cignas or Kaiser. Let's discuss the small and mid-sized segment.

**Expert**
In the top 10 or 15, 100% are piloting something or multiple things. No enterprise rollouts, full stop.

**Client**
Sorry, say that last part again, no enterprise.

No enterprise rollouts for all service lines. I do it by covered lives, which is how I'm used to the segmentation. That's basically five+ million. In the one million-five million range, probably 50%-60% are piloting something at a service line level with a single vendor.

When you get between one million to 100,000 covered lives, probably 30% may be piloting something. I get pretty soft on that. Below 150,000 covered lives, less than 20%. Now remember, that's by an account view. That's not by an account by product, by service line view. If you were to actually look at the total TAM, what percentage has prior auth as a covered lives perspective or actually as a total auth for your stuff, covered lives perspective, 2% maybe. Most of that's probably toasted.

When you think about the market, you have the accounts, and then you have in the accounts the lines of business and the products underneath it. If you're Blues Vermont, you have one account, three lines of business, three products. It counts as three units. For each unit, you're going to have, let's just call it five service lines to keep the math simple, between ambulatory, inpatient, radiology, musculoskeletal, cardiology, oncology, there's six, but let's just pretend it's five. If you think about a solution being sold to Blues Vermont, there's 15 units that are on the table just for Blues Vermont because it's one service line per product.

Now, because of the way they buy, you're going to get all the lines of business together because they're small. It's an important framework to keep in mind. You go to United, and they've got three lines of business X 30 states, that gets you 90 pieces, times the five. Each service line at each state you have 180 implementations or 180 units that implement and sell.

If you look at it that way and go, bottoms up, which is what are all the health plans? What are the states? What are the lines of business? What are the service lines? I would be shocked if the number was more than 2% is using AI. I brought up the ambient example because on one sense it looks like the market's totally solved, but the bookings and the ARR don't match the perception.

**Client**
I think I get your point, but I'm not talking here. I'm talking only about the bookings. I know that the actual usage is far lower, but this 2%, when you say is actual usage like rollout to 2% or is it 2% bookings?

**Expert**
Say 2% bookings.

**Client**
This is very different from scribing then. This is like super early.

**Expert**
It's earlier than scribing, but it's actually not that different than scribing. Remember I said you have to measure, 70% of accounts have picked something in the scribing market, but less than 10% of NPIs or providers in any given account have adopted. Some of them are even less than that. This is why I keep bringing up the book, bookings is cute.

Revenue is the actual interesting indicator because if you're a start-up and I was competing against a start-up that did this crap. Also I was at a start-up that did this crap. We'll go in and sell five products. One of them exists, four of them don't. Let's say each unit of bookings costs $100,000. I'll book. My car will say $500,000. My ARR might say $90,000-100,000.

I'm going to be sitting there with that liability on my balance sheet forever because I'm selling products that don't exist, which for the record, every start-up does. This is the optics game of penetration versus is the revenue there yet? Which is why we haven't seen any transactions in ambient yet because nobody has revenue.

I imagine if you took a look at Abridge's numbers, I think their bookings to ARR is really screwed or really skewed. It's the same thing at Microsoft, same thing in Ambience. It's the same concept but on the health plan side, they're just a little further behind in terms of the account adoption. It's the same challenge in that.

# Transcript

## Discussion on Start-up Vendor Dynamics

**Client:**
I think that will apply to any start-up at this point in this space. What I'm concerned with is, on the optics or the booking side, when a start-up goes to appear, will they say that we're already talking to or we've booked another vendor or will they be open to looking at another start-up's idea?

**Expert:**
Depends on which segment, 500,000 lives and below, once they've picked a vendor, that vendor locked in for the three-year period. You could probably still peel them off with a pilot because again, remember, limited rollout, all based off the business line. You go one+ million, so one million-30 million, they'll have multiple vendors and they actually want multiple vendors piloting in multiple states.

**Client:**
That's where the 2% makes sense because the grid is so big, it's a big matrix. Right now, they might be trying it in one business line or one state, but there's just a lot of gap there to assess from a different lens for them.

**Expert:**
If you think about Humana for a minute, Cohere is great and it's obviously in their MA line of business. I don't think it's every state yet and it's only MSK. What about specialty pharma? What about cardio? What about radiology? What about inpatient? What about ambulatory?

Humana might be a different story because I obviously took a position in Cohere, but let's assume for a minute they didn't. If you had a good offering, why wouldn't they pilot it? It's not like Cohere has solved the entire problem set yet. They plan to. That's what the marketing collateral says. That's the separation. The optics are it looks like this market's moving ultra fast.

In practicality, the market is moving just like every other health plan or payer IT market which is incredibly fucking slowly, pardon my expletive. It's so early innings, we don't even know yet the problem is solvable. I'd say the biggest difference between ambient and prior auth is in ambient, everyone agrees the problem can be solved. The ambient dictation works. It's really cool. The big problem on that side is does it work for everyone? What's the market clearing rate for price? If you look at the per doc price from two years ago, it used to be like $375. Currently down at $200. I think they'll keep going.

**Client:**
Exactly. That makes sense. I think this is super helpful. I've covered all my questions and I really appreciate the insight. Thank you so much for your time.
