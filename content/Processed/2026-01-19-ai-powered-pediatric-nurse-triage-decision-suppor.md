1. ###### **Automation with Clinical Intelligence**

   Most AI tools focus on admin tasks. Lucea pairs automation with clinical intelligence that actually supports clinicians during triage.

1. ###### **Protocol-Aligned Triage**

   We provide protocol-aligned context to help gather complete and consistent information during every triage call, while clinicians retain full clinical judgment.

1. ###### **Clinical Outcomes That Matter**

   The result: Calmer calls, smoother workflows, and stronger practice operations.
