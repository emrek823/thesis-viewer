### Current Financial Position

- Combined household income floor: $703k post-tax / $1.1M pre-tax
- Potential increase with new $25M vehicle closing: $823k post-tax / $1.3M pre-tax
	- Sean expects 20% income increase in next 30 days
	- Closing deadline: Friday (aggressive timeline)
- Sean’s income structure:
	- $480k guaranteed payments from LLC fund management company
	- Variable additional distributions ($150k in 2025)
	- Income locked for next 10 years, expects growth with new funds
- Michelle: W2 CEO income (doesn’t hold majority interest)
- Current home: Little John Lane, $1.717M balance at 1.7% rate with First Citizens

### Home Purchase Planning

- Target area: Austin 78746 (Westlake) - most expensive part of Austin
- Price range: $3.5M - $6M (prefer not upper end)
- Down payment source: existing Merrill savings accounts
- Preference: avoid carrying two properties simultaneously
	- Open to overlap if financing works given low current rate
- Timeline: start listing current home off-market, no immediate sale pressure

### Financing Options & Process

- Self-employment complexity requires 2023-2024 filed returns + interim 2025 financials
- Buyer Ready Program recommended (5-7 business days, 90-day approval)
	- Underwriter pre-approves without specific property
	- Better for self-employed with complex financials
- Loan products discussed:
- Asset leverage options:
	- Loan Management Account (LMA) using Merrill investments as collateral
	- Mortgage 100: pledge assets as secondary collateral for larger loan
	- Recasting available after 6-month seasoning period (free, unlimited)

### Next Steps

- Wait 30 days to start application process
	- Income changes expected from fund closing
	- Better 2025 tax picture needed
- Documentation needed when ready:
	- 2023-2024 personal/business tax returns
	- Recent K-1s, W-2s, pay stubs
	- First Citizens mortgage statement
	- 2025 interim financials (CPA-prepared preferred)
- Tim to handle:
	- New checking account for Michelle (individual, not joint)
	- Activate kids’ custodial accounts visibility
	- Life insurance application (target first week February)
	- Account consolidation into Merrill platform
