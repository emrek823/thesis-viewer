### Background & Connection

- Joe worked with Julius at Incitel; transitioning from policy work to advocacy on Capitol Hill
- Looking for venture opportunities after experience at IQT and bio/national security roles
- Commission work winding down as focus shifts from policy development to Hill advocacy

### China Competition Strategy & Congressional Recommendations

- Substantive grounds and plays well politically: strategic competition with China
	- US historically led biotech but falling behind in some areas
	- Bottom line: 50 recommendations for $15B over 5 years to retake lead vs China
- Recommendations moving to Congress through key vehicles
	- Traction on mechanical process: few big bills (NDAA, IAA)
	- 21 of 49 recommendations now in one of those 2 bills
	- Things housed at DoD and intelligence community gaining momentum

### Data & Innovation Initiatives

- Biological data underutilized as strategic resource
	- Promote and protect recommendations for genomic data
	- Limited protections currently in place for genomic data vs healthcare data
	- Few rules established to monitor success protecting bulk genomic data transfer
- Web of biological data: easy single entry point for researchers to access data
- AI-ready biological data standards
	- NIST developing standards for what qualifies as AI-ready
	- Tie government funding requirements to AI-ready data standards
- US Government funded cloud labs bill gaining traction
- Grand challenge initiatives:
	- Science of scale up for biomanufacturing
	- Make bio more predictably engineerable (vs current imprecision compared to mechanical engineering)

### Next Steps

- Both parties to share relevant portfolio companies and connections
- Stay in touch informally, exchange ideas as opportunities arise
- Emre to visit DC monthly (family connection) - potential for in-person meetings
