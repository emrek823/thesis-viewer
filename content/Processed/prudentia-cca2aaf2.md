## Executive Summary
Prudentia is building a software platform with 4 components (orchestration, integrative analytics, asset valuation, and portfolio assessment) for multiple business units within pharma (BD&L, clinical development, regulatory, commercial, market access, regulatory) to unlock clinical and commercial success of a drug through data-driven Integrated Product Profiles (IPPs).

IPPs are the next-generation of Target Product Profiles (TPPs). TPPs have been around for decades and are living documents that impact decisions and constituents across the entire pharma value chain - from pre-IND applications in the preclinical setting to commercializing and marketing approved drugs. Today, these TPPs are developed by consultants with slide decks and excel, cost $1M+ per asset, and are inefficient, incomplete, and imprecise. Impending patent cliffs are increasing reliance on external M&A/BD and increasing clinical trial complexity is pushing biopharma companies to consider commercial considerations (e.g., can this drug drive $2B+ in peak sales?) earlier in clinical development.

These dynamics create a ripe opportunity for Prudentia to tackle this initial $5.5B SAM market with potential to expand into the broader $50B clinical trial TAM through IPPs - a collaborative, data-driven, and dynamic version of the historical TPP. Prudentia goes beyond simply summarizing and structuring publicly available information by creating a platform for pharma to leverage their internal data assets, bring in RWD vendors, and for Prudentia to develop their own IP around quantitative components of the analysis (e.g. PTRS = probability of technical and regulatory success; NPV = risk-adjusted net present value, etc).

Prudentia's GTM is focused on BD&L teams initially within biopharma sponsors. These groups have larger budgets than clinical development, shorter sales cycles, and provide land-and-expand opportunities to other functional areas given their strategic positioning within biopharma. While still in stealth and prior to launch, Sadiqa Mahmood (CEO) and John Reynders (CTO) have leveraged their personal networks and previous relationships in the space to build a late-stage pipeline of 7 customers that represent a $2M-$3M revenue opportunity.

Historically, pharma tech has been a highly acquisitive space with public comps trading at a premium to market as a whole given market tailwinds and recurring business models. In the near/mid-term, Prudentia has the opportunity to rinse and repeat its current BD success to drive its first $10M in revenue (ACVs range from $500k - $1m+). Over the longer term, this wedge with IPP gives Prudentia the ability to land-and-expand within pharma business units and functions to create a true platform in a sea of pharma tech point solutions.

We are excited to invest $1m at a $20M post-money cap (SAFE) to close the current pipeline and reach $2M+ in revenue in the next 12-18 months, continue product development, and help the Prudentia team raise an additional equity round over the next 2-3 months to expedite commercial progress.

In pharma tech, we tend to index on teams (e.g., Ryght, Mural) that have relationships and experience to expedite GTM and reduce sales cycles that can also tie together innovative product development. Sadiqa Mahmood (founder and CEO) and John Reynders (CTO) fit this archetype to a tee. We would back Sadiqa or John individually as founders, and the combination together creates a unique opportunity we haven't seen in pharma tech over the last 3 years.

*   **Sadiqa Mahmood** - Sadiqa brings a unique blend of clinical, technical, and business expertise in pharma specifically, and her experience across clinical trials has organically led her to this specific build at Prudentia. Sadiqa is a physician who has worked at clinical trial sites (MGH, Dana Farber), has experience with groundbreaking science and genomics at the Broad Institute, has been involved with numerous clinical trial vendors (Javarra, Cytel) in different capacities, and grew Health Catalyst's life sciences business from 0 to $40M in ARR in 3 years. Her defining experience at Health Catalyst was particularly impressive as she came in as a director, replaced the standing head of the unit, and drove multimillion deals out of the gate.
*   **John Reynders** - Over the last decade, multiple big pharma companies (Eli Lily, Novartis, etc) have brought in chief digital officers from other industries because of the lack of technical and digital talent in the life sciences space. John has been CIO or leading data science in teams for biopharma for the last 20 years that have touched every biopharma function and therapeutic area. He started as the CIO of Discovery at Eli Lily in 2004, transitioned to CIO of Pharma R&D at J&J, moved to AstraZeneca as the VP of R&D Information Systems, and was the founding CIO at Moderna. Moderna was one of the early leaders in AI and compute that John had a key role in driving. After leading data science and R&D strategy at Alexion (acquired for $13.3B), he was the Chief Data Sciences Officer at Neumora, an Arch Ventures backed biotech that launched with $500M to redefine neuroscience with data science.

## Background: What is a Target Product Profile (TPP)?
Prudentia is taking a target product profile (TPP) built in excel, word, and powerpoint on bespoke and public datasets, and creating a software platform to quantify this process and leverage novel datasets - what Prudentia has termed an Integrated Product Profile (IPP). Prudentia talks about its Integrated Product Profile (IPP) to emphasize and communicate to customers a new way of working with TPPs with a software platform that is collaborative, quantifiable, dynamic, and pulls in novel data sources.

**Target Product Profile (TPP):** Every biopharma company uses a TPP in some way, shape or form. TPPs are not just an output or a format for a document that people have to follow, but the encapsulation and representation of the multi-step process that requires work from every team within a biopharma company to drive an asset through clinical development. A TPP helps answer the question (among many others) - what is the risk adjusted commercial potential of this drug in Ph II if this clinical trial is successful? TPP's are a unique place for Prudentia to start because they are already utilized today as a core piece of the pharma value chain, a manual and inefficient process that teams typically pay consultants 7-figures for, done at the beginning of clinical development and impact all downstream decisions, and one of the few (if not only) areas where multiple BUs in pharma (clinical development, BD&L, regulatory, commercial, etc) already collaborate today.

**Kymera Example for Current TPP:** As a real-life example, Kymera ($2.7B market cap) had multiple assets in pre-IND or ph I stage. They engaged a consulting firm to need to plan where to invest $100s of millions to fund clinical development based on the commercial potential of each asset. Essentially, these TPPs are the result of multiple “what-if” scenarios based on historical clinical trials, current drugs in market, and early data on these assets that are used to project future commercial potential to justify further investment. This single PPT slide is a simple representation and summary for the sake of discussion, but there is a 100+ slide PPT deck that provides supporting information for this 1-slide overview. This process takes weeks to months and requires multiple groups from within sponsors and CROs.

| MOA and Therapeutic Hypothesis | The immunomodulatory effects of STAT3 activation on the tumor microenvironment are involved in resistance to PD-1 inhibitors, and its downregulation may restore sensitivity to PD-1 inhibition. Product P is a heterobifunctional small molecule therapeutic targeting STAT3 to mediate the selective degradation of STAT3 protein.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Indication Statement         | Product P, by degrading STAT3 protein and thereby re-modeling the tumor microenvironment, will be efficacious when used in combination with a PD-1 inhibitor in MSI-H mCRC that has relapsed on a prior PD-1 inhibitor. Product P and PD-1 inhibitor combination is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with MSI-H/dMMR mCRC who have progressed on PD-1 inhibitors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

*   **Current Treatment Paradigm:** Analysis of current treatment guidelines (e.g., NCCN for oncology) from to understand the current treatment paradigm and epidemiology. This process current relies on stale public data from the web, paid subscriptions like UpToDate, and - one of the most error prone but still relied upon methods - primary research. Primary research involves calling prescribing physicians, presenting this simple and theoretical PPT slide, and asking how many patients they would prescribe it in today or 5 years.
*   **Competitive Landscape:** Analysis of current drugs on market (publications, investor presentations) and in late-stage pipeline (clincialtrials.gov) to understand potential market share for a pipeline asset. Often times, the TPP are slight iterations on standard of care (SOC) or hand-wavey extrapolations of early-stage clinical trial data. For example, the TPP above was essentially saying this new drug would be as efficacious as standard of care with better safety profile and dosing (less frequent).
*   **Therapeutic Hypothesis:** Preclinical data on an asset (internal data, publications/poster) that informs the therapeutic hypothesis as to why this drug can be differentiated.
*   **Financial Projections:** Bringing together all data sources to predict future revenue ramp and perform an NPV (or risk adjusted NPV analysis) using inaccurate industry benchmarks.

## Why Now?
Impending patent cliffs and loss of exclusivity (LOE) are driving increased M&A as big pharma increasingly relies on external innovation, while increasing clinical trial complexity is driving biopharma to bring commercial considerations earlier (pre-IND) in the clinical development process. Novartis is canonical example of how biopharma companies are reacting to these trends in the pharma world of fast-followers. Prudentia can take advantage of these trends and serve biopharma customers with a software platform to replace bespoke consulting processes as data science sophistication increases in biopharma and increasing access to data internally pushes pharma to make use of data they already have.

**Novartis as Leader in Industry of Fast-followers:** Novartis hired an biotech equity analyst from Wall Street - Ronny Gal - to “help pick winners from internal and external pipelines...by push[ing] a target profile and understanding of what a particular molecule will do commercially, earlier in development.” While every biopharma might not have this same organizational structure (nor is it required for Prudentia to be successful) it's a representation of how biopharma companies are looking to change their strategy to embrace the changing worldview Prudentia can enable.

**Patent Cliff / LOE:** Patent cliffs and exclusivity are inherent with the pharma business model, but the scale of that problem has never been higher, with >$200B of sales at-risk through 2028. The imminent loss of billions in revenue due to patent cliffs is creating urgency for pharmaceutical companies to replenish their pipelines. With internal R&D often insufficient to fill these gaps, companies are likely to increase M&A and BD activities to acquire new assets and technologies. 50% of the >$200B of at-risk revenue is in '27-28, which means now is the time pharma will start angling to replace these via high-conviction R&D & BD efforts. With the IRA, the "clock" for price negotiation starts at the time of initial launch, so companies are now incentivized to launch in the largest (1st line) setting upfront, as opposed to launching in a late-line setting with a lower bar for success & gradually working upwards.

### M&A Activity:
Big pharma deal sizes may be down, but the overall volume of M&A is tracking towards record levels. The preference for bolt-on acquisitions and de-risked assets continues, with a focus on oncology, immunology, and the rapidly growing cardio metabolism/obesity sector. This reflects the industry's strategy to mitigate risks associated with internal R&D while accessing innovative technologies and therapies to drive future growth.

**Increasing Trial Design and Complexity:** No matter how you quantify it, clinical trials are becoming more complex. The past decade has seen many innovations in clinical trials, including new trial formats, novel endpoints, new biomarkers and ways of stratifying patients, a broader set of data sources such as real-world data and digital device data, and many others. New regulatory guidelines which impact the design of specific studies. Many sponsors need to conduct clinical trials across more countries and sites to facilitate competitive differentiation and market access. Sponsors are also under pressure to recruit patients faster and to manage costs. In parallel, trial timelines have increased and success rates remain stubbornly low.

**Increasing Data Science Sophistication:** Roche is spending $3B+ annually on digital infrastructure and Sanofi is transforming 2,000 TB of healthcare data / month. These companies and many more across the biopharma landscape continue to increase their sophistication and expand beyond niche business units. These organizations are adopting next-generation infrastructure to connect data within cross-functional teams - across different personas (data scientist, sales rep, marketing, researcher), internal organizations (finance, commercial, manufacturing) and data types.

**Data Access → Data Utility:** Biopharma is moving from a world of purely data access to a focus on transforming and leveraging this data to drive utility. Historically, biopharma companies relied on claims data (Komodo, Symphony, IQVIA, etc) to drive analyses mostly in the commercial setting. Over time, players like Datavant increased the linkage of different data assets (EMR, SDoH, genomics, claims, etc) for a variety of use cases for clinical development and commercial. At this point, most biopharma sponsors see claims data as commoditized and have already bought most of the EHR data they need (Roche acquiring Flatiron, BMS with Concert.AI, etc). Today, biopharma companies are looking for vendors and solutions that can help them leverage their current data assets to drive tangible business value - something that Prudentia directly solves with its approach.

## Product
Prudentia has the MVP built today to serve its initial 7 customers it is in discussions with. Over the next 12 months, the company will continue to develop its core collaboration and orchestration platform as it develops quantitative insights and unique IP around how to actually value a therapeutic asset and manage a portfolio of assets. Prudentia's offering will be a combination of managed services and software, which will be a 50/50 split originally and shift to 70-80% software over time (similar to Veeva's progression).

| **Lack of coordination (data & people):** The decisions of the BD&L team to prioritize a certain therapeutic area (neuroscience) are made independently of the preclinical team's understanding of novel mechanisms of actions (MOAs) and the clinical development team's understanding of sites and recruitment capabilities.                                                                                                                                                                                | Orchestration                | Collaborative software platform where BD&L, regulatory, clinical development, discovery, market access, and commercial teams can all work and upload documents.

| **Analyses are Bespoke & Isolated:** Epidemiology and competitive intelligence are the major inputs that drive revenue potential, but the outputs are dependent on qualitative interviews with physicians (how many patients would you prescribe this drug to if it were available in 3 years) and averages of epidemiology models built by equity research analysts who aren't close to the science.                                                                                              | Integrative Analytics (including LLMs) | In conversations with biopharma, Prudentia has been able to analyze publications and adverse events from the FDA to identify adverse events (AEs) for pancreatic cancer patients taking GLP-1s. This AE was identified years after GLP-1 launch in subsequent trials, but Prudentia is able to pull these novel insights out ahead of time. Prudentia could help define the inclusion/exclusion criteria for a protocol design based on RWD assets that predict patient enrollment from sites to inform clinical trial design from the outset.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Asset valuations are based on static and outdated assumptions:** Probability of technical and regulatory success (PTRS) is calculated based on nature review articles of all drug classes (small molecule vs. cell therapy), indications (neuro vs. oncology), and lack real-world data beyond what is published in literature.                                                                                                                                                                          | Asset valuation (PTRS)       | Developing dynamic "what-if" scenarios to understand how potential changes would've impacted historical assets and insights for future clinical development. For example, how would Keytruda's clinical trial outcomes or revenue potential differed if they started in 1L NSCLC vs. starting in later lines of therapy?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Portfolio strategy driven by single assets rather than comprehensive assessment of entire portfolio:** The process to create a single TPP today is painstaking and manual so BD and strategy teams make decisions on a portfolio of 20+ assets based on TPPs of a single asset. Even worse, these decisions are made on 2 week M&A timelines in isolation from a broader strategy. | Portfolio management (NPV)   | BD&L teams across biopharma are often left to the blunt hammer of $B M&A because of the lack of sophistication on portfolio strategy. Prudentia can enable capital allocation decisions (indication expansion, licensing, royalties, partnerships, biomarker strategies) to create and add value for each individual asset in the context of the broader portfolio. |

**Users:** We highlight the multiple users of Prudentia's platform (image below) because it is core to their ultimate vision and representative of why they chose the IPP (or a better TPP) as a wedge. This process of developing an IPP is one of the few (if not only) areas for a biopharma company that requires this type of collaborative effort.

### Prudentia Platform Users (Diagram Interpretation)
*   **Discovery:** Data enabled drug candidate nomination & IND application
*   **Clinical Development & Ops:** Clinical differentiation, study design & strategy
*   **Regulatory Affairs:** Real time regulatory landscape and target label generation
*   **BD&L:** Assess value of the asset and portfolio for dealmaking
*   **Commercial:** Maximize market value and probability of reimbursement

**Back-end:** Prudentia's back-end infrastructure emphasizes 2 main points that fuel value for customers and their GTM strategy

*   **LLMs are one tool in the toolkit for integrative analytics.** LLMs can be helpful to scrape public data sources (clinical trials, adverse events, publications, abstracts, SEC filings, etc) and provide an easy-to-use chat interface for data analysis (text-to-SQL). Prudentia also wants to leverage classic data science techniques to analyze structured data (claims data, excel-like outputs) and build IP around the specific analysis or methodology that drives asset and portfolio value.

## Commercial/GTM
The Prudentia team has leveraged their industry experience and connections to build of pipeline of 6 late-stage conversations with biopharma. The company's phased GTM approach - land with BD&L teams (quicker sales cycles, larger budgets), expand to other business units (BUs), and leverage managed services to drive initial customer stickiness - helps to expedite the sales cycle for current discussions and fuel future growth. IPPs are a unique wedge in biopharma as they truly inform all downstream decision-making, creating additional areas for them to add value over time.

### Market Segment Focus – FY24 & FY25 (Diagram Interpretation)
**TOP 20 Pharma:**
*   Entry point via BD&L team
*   Entry point via Portfolio Managers and Program Leads
*   M&A - Decision enablement tool

**Near-term pipeline:** Prudentia has a near-term pipeline of 7 customers that are 3 of top 10 pharma before launching from stealth. The company's $2-$3M ARR goal for next year is in front of them if they can close their current pipeline, and we have confidence they can repeat this early success with other clients.

These opportunities are focused on companies with GLP-1 assets, a cardiometabolic focus, or anything CNS-related (especially given John's background). Initially, Sadiqa and team sold to some R&D/clinical development groups within these organizations, but it has quickly shifted to BD&L teams.

Sadiqa and John are discussing and negotiating pricing with these groups, which range from $250K-$500K, or up to a $1M for some customers.

**IPPs as Wedge ("Tip of the Spear"):** There are a sea of point solutions across the pharma tech landscape that tackle different pieces of the value chain and tap into different budgets. We highlight these not from a direct competitive sense (more on direct competition below) but to highlight the advantage of Prudentia's approach starting with IPPs and targeting BD teams.

### Life Sciences IT and Tech-Enabled Services Landscape (Image Reference)
This section contains a large image titled "Life Sciences IT and Tech-Enabled Services Landscape" from "William Blair 2024 Landscape". It categorizes numerous companies into "Clinical Trial-Related Software and Tech-Enabled Services", "Data, Insights, and Analytics", "Commercialization Insights, Software, and Tech-Enabled Services", "Drug Research & Development", and "Rx Adherence & Access". Due to the high density of small logos and text, a full transcription is impractical and would not add significant structured data beyond the categories themselves which are already described in the text.

*   **IPPs as "Tip of the Spear":** IPPs provide the data, rationale, and context upstream to inform a variety of biopharma functions. The data that Prudentia collects and analysis it provides are the same data and insights that inform protocol design (how do we design this trial for competitive edge?), site selection (which KOLs do we need to include in our trial for ideal outcomes?), market access (what outcomes do we need to show for favorable formulary positioning?), commercial intelligence (how should sales team position against competitors?), and many others.
*   **BD Drives Multi-Million ($M) and Billion ($B) dollar outcomes:** At the end of the day, all of these activities (clinical trials, RWD, sales intelligence, etc) are to driving towards commercial success of a drug. Prudentia starts with these BD teams that are making million and billion dollar decisions and drives decisions top-down. We believe that Prudentia can reduce the value these point solutions provide and capture more budget over time.

Prudentia is focused on driving BD activities for biopharma and can partner with many of the companies listed below. From a “jobs-to-be-done" perspective", however, many of the individual point solutions listed below answer the same questions that Prudentia can also answer with its focus on IPPs.

*   Clinical science and regulatory affairs (Fresnel, faro, Navidence, Value and access, MMIT)
*   Medical affairs (H1, komodo)
*   Commercial (Evaluate, DEFINITIVE HEALTHCARE)

**Stakeholders - Data Assets:**
*   Regulatory authorities
*   HTA authorities and payers
*   HCPs and patients
*   Hospitals and health systems

**Key Performance Indicators/Outcomes:**
*   Efficacy, safety, and quality
*   Added benefit and cost-effectiveness
*   Position in the treatment pathway
*   Patient experience and convenience

Edited from https://www.bcg.com/publications/2023/the-future-of-integrated-evidence-planning-in-biopharma

*   **Faro:** SaaS platform for protocol design that heavily leverages previous outcomes from clinical trials.
*   **Navidence:** Operational definitions that define what a 2L NSCLC actually when analyzing claims data (previous claims for chemo regimen <6 months prior) to inform market sizing.
*   **MMIT:** Scrapes public payer formularies to understand different tiers for drugs (e.g., drugs >$10K/month and no differentiation with standard of care are Tier 3 and require prior auths and step edits).
*   **H1:** Linkedin for Clinical Trial Investigators and Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs). Scraping publically available publications and previous trial publications to understand experience and value in running a trial.
*   **Evaluate Pharma:** Drug forecasts that are an average of equity analyst reports. These equity analyst forecasts themselves are based on publicly available data and assumptions from analysts that are not close to the science or the asset.
*   **Definitive:** Provider reference data (scraped from the web and from literal cold calling) to inform provider targeting (e.g., I want to target oncologists that are affiliated with a large academic institution)
*   **Komodo:** Claims data (acquired from CMS and open/closed source vendors like clearinghouses, payers, and other data aggregators to understand patient journeys and referral patterns.

This strategy is possible because of Prudentia's wedge at the tip of the spear with IPPs for BD teams that define downstream processes, and 2 fundamental technical trends.

*   **Data Access is becoming commoditized, increasing emphasis on data transformation and driving utility of data.** Many of these companies have built platforms on commoditized data assets (can scrape public data with LLMs) or ones that pharma already has internally (claims data is table stakes in 2024). Value is starting to shift and accrue to companies that can actually make use of this data to drive business value.
*   **LLMs reduce the cost of launching new software (UIs / workflows).** Typically, we think of the chatUI experience of talking with your data because of chatGPT, but LLMs also drive more efficient software engineering. Engineers today can leverage LLMs to build SaaS modules better, faster, and cheaper. Prudentia already has all of the data required to generate the template for protocol design/med affairs/INDs, and will already be integrated and working with these teams.

## Market Size
Prudentia's initial $5.5B service addressable market (SAM) - $1M annual contract value for IPPs with ~5.5K clinical trial starts annually - provides a wedge into the broader clinical trial market ($50B) given their GTM focus mentioned above. To gut check some of these assumptions, we look at Norstella, a $550M annual revenue company built on a 90's tech stack and undifferentiated data assets, to understand the path to $100M in revenue (20% of Norstella current book of business).

**$5.5B SAM:** Consulting firms and companies like Clarify (based on work with Novartis' BD&L team in 2021 for example) to validate the $1M ACV on average for each trial per asset. We use this as a baseline for our analysis and multiply by 5.5K annual global clinical trial starts. Over time, Prudentia can use its wedge with IPPs to expand to own more of the clinical development and commercial process over time as it expands to more business units within biopharma sponsors and CROs.

Prudentia 2024 Pitch Deck

**Norstella Comp:** We use Norstella as a market comp with a subpar product and undifferentiated data assets to highlight the potential for innovative products to capture market share in this space. Norstella is a pharma data and analytics conglomerate with 5 legacy products that were built in the 1990's and have been cobbled together by PE over the years. In 2023, Norstella did $533.3M in annual revenue (78% subscription revenue) with 78% gross margins. Welsh and management are projecting 15-20% growth over the next 2-3 years on top of this strong base. These product offerings are shockingly unsophisticated, built on top of undifferentiated data assets, and additional product development is extremely limited as WCAS drives EBITDA improvements for exit in the next 3-5 years.

## Competitive Landscape
Today, Prudentia directly competes with incumbent companies like Medidata, IQVIA, and Certara that have built rudimentary dashboards for valuation analysis without any novel methodology. Many AI-native individual point solutions that have been founded over the last 2 years (Argon AI, Fresnel, Maven Bio, etc) touches on pieces of Prudentia's approach, but are mostly GPT-wrappers around consulting projects.

### Competitive Landscape Table

CROs/legacy vendors like Medidata Acorn AI, IQVIA Infosario, and Certara Clinical Trial Simulator offer SaaS models and some IPP-related features but lack Prudentia's comprehensive IPP generation and scenario planning.

*   **Medidata Acorn AI:** Offers a SaaS model and AI platform, but lacks specific IPP generation and scenario planning capabilities.
*   **IQVIA Infosario:** Provides a SaaS model and some IPP-related features. Doesn't offer full IPP generation or competitor landscape analysis.
*   **Certara Trial Simulator:** Has a SaaS model and AI platform with active learning, but lacks comprehensive IPP generation and analysis tools.

AI-native point solutions such as Fresnel Bio, Argon AI, Maven Bio, and Sleuth are narrower approaches with different GTM strategies and value props that focus on different BUs in biopharma.

*   **Fresnel Bio:** Helps preclinical and clinical development teams understand the genomic association of a target with disease, its biological context, the feasibility of drugging it, its potential safety risks, and the competitive landscape of clinical trials related to it
    *   **Image interpretation:** A dashboard with sections for Genetics (circular plot), Gene Expression (scatter plot), Known Biology (network diagram), and Clinical Trials (survival curve). It shows various genes of interest (e.g., TNFSF15, NOD2, IL23R).
*   **Argon AI:** Competitive intelligence and automated workflows for consultants and biopharma teams.
    *   **Image interpretation:** An "Ask Argon AI" interface showing search results for clinical trials related to Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), with options for card view, analytics, and filters.
*   **Maven:** Intelligent search of biopharma specific documents, focused on financial documents (earnings transcripts, SEC filings) in addition to clinical information and context from
    *   **Image interpretation:** A chat interface where "JM Jennifer" asks for a summary of Lilly's BD priorities based on earnings calls. "MB Maven" provides an answer, sourcing from multiple Eli Lilly earnings call transcripts.
*   **Sleuth (stealth):** Focused on generating probability distributions that guide decision making through a semi-automated, patent-pending approach.
    *   **Image interpretation:** Compares "Standard Approach" with "Sleuth Approach".
        *   **Standard Approach:**
            *   Call KOLs/management/sell-side (Same insights as others)
            *   "Deep science" analysis (Too complicated to model effectively)
            *   Limited Excel-based data analysis
            *   Best guess
        *   **Sleuth Approach (1):**
            *   Extract data from multiple sources (Trials, papers, registries, corporate docs)
            *   Identify similar trials (Patent-pending algorithm)
            *   Build model for projected trial (User-adjustable sliders to further optimize)
            *   Iterate as needed
            *   Algorithm improvement for next iteration
            *   Generate probability distribution over potential outcomes (Visualize in seconds)

## Financing / Milestones
Prudentia has raised $2M total to-date, including Virtue's $1M. The company has already built out its initial software platform that is ready to sell and generate IPPs with managed services to provide white-glove support to large enterprise customers. Given the team's commercial relationships in the space and initial pipeline, the team is raising an additional $6M - $8M to fuel this commercial growth and hit $3M in revenue over the next 18 months.

~60% of the raise will go towards product development to build out the additional features for additional business units and invest in the development of proprietary IP to fuel quantitative analyses. The team will leverage its founders-led sales motion to close enterprise contracts but will use ~20% of additional financing to round out clinical / sales commercial team (BD, sales, customer success, etc) to support its growing pipeline.

The 2 main goals across product and commercial are

*   **Product:** Develop methodology quantitative analyses - PTRS for clinical development and NPV for BD/commercial. The initial focus for BD&L teams will be driving value across label expansion strategy and IP lifetime expansion / extension, which are areas to drive near-term ROI. Prudentia will also focus on driving collaboration and integrative data collection across multiple teams to highlight the value of real-time data insights.
*   **Commercial:** Close and move along at least ~50% of the current pipeline with initial pilots ($250-$500K) and demonstrate land-and-expand potential within BD&L and among other teams within biopharma. After initial customer success, Prudentia will drive a managed services strategy that thoughtful drives product upgrades across the customer base as well as generating revenue. While the company is focused on a direct sales motion today, there are opportunities to partner with companies for distribution (CROs, legacy clinical trial vendors) and other data partners (EMR, claims, genomics, commercial intel, etc).

**M&A and Public Market Comps:** The pharma data and analytics space is highly acquisitive and public sector companies trade at a premium to the market as a whole given the market tailwinds, recurring business models, and high margins. We analyze recent M&A comps and public market performance to quantify why we are attracted to pharma tech companies as a whole (Mural, Ryght, Integral, etc) and believe there are multiple opportunities for $1B+ outcomes in the space.

## Opportunities / Risks
### Opportunities
*   **Experienced Team with Clinical Trial, BD, and Technical Experience.** We would back Sadiqa or John individually as founders, and the combination together creates a unique opportunity we haven't seen in pharma tech over the last 3 years. Sadiqa's previous experience (clinical care, clinical trial sites, clinical trial vendors, RWD, genomics) directly inform her build and give her unique insights at Prudentia. John is one of the few CIO/CDO's in biopharma that have his experience at true scale. This a top 5 team in our portfolio of already high-quality founders.
*   **IPPs as the "Tip of the Spear".** There a sea of point solution vendors in the clinical trial and RWD space that get isolated to specific business units or functions within biopharma. IPPs (and the GTM wedge working with BD&L teams) gives Prudentia the opportunity to land and expand within multiple BUs within biopharma. It's a unique opportunity and approach to create a true platform in biopharma tech in a sea of point solutions.
*   **Market Timing / Size.** Pharma tech is a large and growing market with attractive return profiles (M&A and public comps). This team is tackling this space with a unique GTM approach during a time when biopharma companies are actively looking for the solution and value that Prudentia provides. These tailwinds provide the initial impetus to drive the land-and-expand motion for Prudentia that can create a category defining business.

### Risks
*   **Managed Services → Software Evolution.** Initially, Prudentia is starting off with 50/50 managed services and software to drive initial customer success, develop product, and ensure stickiness with initial customers. Biopharma companies are used to leveraging outsourced consulting services, so there is a risk that Prudentia is pushed to provide more managed services to drive initial revenue and fails to shift its revenue to 70-80% software. We have confidence because of this team's technical ability (John to drive product decisions and Pranathi to build) that they can build software that individual users within biopharma will utilize daily and weekly (vs. typical one-off consulting projects). We have seen this model successfully with other companies in pharma tech (Veeva, Komodo, TriNetX, etc) and understand how these GTM motions evolve over time.
*   **Quantification of Product / Software Development.** The ultimate measure of success if an IPP worked is a drug in clinical trials is approved and drives $2B+ in sales, which takes years. Prudentia has to move beyond productivity or efficiency metrics on ROI (e.g., we save BD&L team time) to demonstrate and drive attribution around novel insights the company drives to impact capital allocation for $100s of millions to $1B+. If they are able to do so, they can capture a percentage of that spend to build a large business.
*   **Long-term Data Asset Differentiation.** At least today, Prudentia is indexing on building IP around the specific quantitative analysis of data vs. owning proprietary data assets itself. We have seen the evolution in biopharma specifically of companies moving away from pure data access because they already have certain datasets (claims) or realize the true value is how you transform the data to drive insights (reducing value of pure data sales). However, it is still a risk we have to manage as LLMs continue to evolve and shift where value accrues in the technology stack.
