# Solstice Series A Deck Feedback

From Virtue | January 5, 2026

## Key Feedback

1. **Stop leaning into amateur status.** The team slide undercuts you — "10000x ideas that haven't worked" and "no professional experience" reads as self-deprecating, not scrappy. Lead with what makes you win: Jesse from Minds & Assembly brings pharma agency credibility, you shipped $2.3M ARR in 4 months, and Phathom replaced their Omnicom AOR with you. That's the story.

2. **The $15M math doesn't work on expansion alone — be explicit about new logo requirements.** AstraZeneca whale is 2027, not 2026 (your email says "$5M+ for 2027"). Sanofi can't 10x in one year (budget cycles are annual). Realistic expansion: $5-6M. You need $9-10M from 15-20 new logos. Say it: "Path to $15M: $5-6M expansion + $9-10M from 10-15 new logos." That's more credible than over-promising on expansion.

3. **Stronger "Why Now"** — you have great quotes from Sanofi and others that show nuanced urgency. Quantify it: $236B patent cliff, Bayer moving media in-house, 3-month email cycles in a world where AI can do it in minutes. The quotes from customers about why they're switching now should be in the deck.

4. **Align on contracts before going out on raise.** ARR, CARR, recognized revenue, and timing of contracts must be crystal clear and be consistent with historical, today, and go forward.

5. **Clarify your growth story** — three distinct motions, different weights:
   - Land and expand within current accounts (content generation) → $5-6M realistic
   - Sell to new accounts for content generation → $9-10M needed, requires Head of Sales
   - Expand into full commercial engine → How much do you lean into this for Series A? It's a bigger vision but less proven. Decide how prominently to feature.

6. **Your best proof points aren't in the deck.** Phathom dropped MRM/Omnicom for Solstice — that's your killer productization proof. Alexion went $25K → $350K (14x in one quarter) — that's your land-and-expand proof. AstraZeneca potential $5M+ whale — that's your path to scale. Sanofi 3 contracts across brands — that's multi-brand expansion. Add a case study slide.

7. **Kill the "Your Bet" slide** — it raises doubts at the worst moment. "Can we expand? Can we productize?" leaves investors with open questions right before the ask. Reframe as "What We've Proven / What We'll Prove" and move it earlier, or address these in GTM and Team slides instead.

8. **Aesthetics.** Current black-white-grey schema could benefit from accent color(s); currently a bit robotic.

## Deck Reordering

Current order buries traction at slide 10. Recommended flow:


## Specific Slide Fixes

**Traction (Slide 2)**
→ Add Q1 milestone: "$4M ARR target by end of Q1"
→ Shows near-term execution bar

**Snapshot (Slide 3)**
→ Add explicit logos: Sanofi, AstraZeneca, Alexion, UCB
→ "Top 10 biopharma customers" is vague — name them

**Model (Slide 8)**
→ Add engagement lead ratio: "Current: 1:3-5 clients → Target: 1:10+"
→ Shows productization path with a metric

**Traction (Slide 10)**
→ Illustrate the exponential growth; currently 'linear' in appearance. For instance, not showing a ~6x increase from Q3→Q4 visually. Much stronger when you illustrate the exponential growth.

**Case Studies (Slide 11) — NEW**
→ Phathom: Dropped MRM/Omnicom AOR for Solstice (productization proof)
→ Alexion: $25K pilot → $350K contract in one quarter (14x land-and-expand)
→ Optional: Sanofi 3 contracts across brands, AstraZeneca $5M+ potential

**GTM (Slide 13)**
→ Break down the $15M: "$X expansion + $Y new logos"
→ Add back a new logo target (the "race to Top 20 logos" was removed)

**Team (Slide 14)**
→ Complete reframe — lead with strengths
→ Add Jesse Lee (Head of Ops) who has pharma agency credibility
→ Cut the self-deprecating bios

## Questions We Need Answered

1. **$15M breakdown:** How much from expansion vs. new logos? Walk us through the math.
2. **New logo pipeline:** Takeda and Pfizer mentioned. What stage? Expected close timing?
3. **Head of Sales:** When will this role be filled? Founder-led can't scale to 15+ new deals.
4. **Platform vs. service split:** What % is platform-automated vs. engagement-lead-delivered?
5. **Runway:** $1.2M cash, $150K burn = 8 months. What's the backup if raise takes longer?

## Bottom Line

- **The company is real.** $2.3M ARR, marquee logos, Phathom AOR replacement prove PMF.
- **The deck undersells you.** Best proof points (Phathom, Alexion 14x) aren't in the slides.
- **The $15M math needs revision.** Expansion-only won't get there. Own the new logo requirement.
- **The team slide needs work.** Don't lead with weaknesses.
