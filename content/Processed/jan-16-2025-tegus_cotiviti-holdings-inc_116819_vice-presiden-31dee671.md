## Client
Hello and thanks for taking the time to speak with me today. As a bit of context, we are trying to better understand the risk adjustment landscape. We have some background in revenue cycle management and coding services within healthcare, but we're pretty new to risk adjustment. We're really trying to use this call to get up to speed, specifically with respect to how folks on the provider side think about risk adjustment. I have an agenda prepared, but maybe a good place to start would just be your background and how you oversee this function within VNA.

## Expert
Sure. I've worked in the healthcare space now for almost 18 years and currently work for a selection IDN. As an integrated delivery network, we have both a payer and a provider group. The payer function actually relatively is unique. There are not that many IDNs in the marketplace that have a payer as part of a system which has hospitals, primary care, etc.

I lead our innovation development initiatives for our health system and am responsible for the procurement of all of our external partners that support our health system, which includes, of course, risk adjustment software platforms, EMR, you name it. I work very closely with our value-based care contracting initiatives, as that is part of my responsibility. Of course, risk adjustment and improving clinical quality are part of that VBC space. Hopefully, I can provide some useful insight for you today.

## Client
Super helpful. Just to make sure I understand. Yes, of course, VNA is an IDN, but you mentioned they have a payer and a provider function. Do you mean to say that VNA has its own plan?

## Expert
We just launched a plan about three years ago. It's a very small part of our IDN. We actually have a payer within the IDN. As I mentioned before, there aren't many IDNs in the U.S. that have a payer arm, but yes, we do. A majority of our business today is providers caring for patients. We have a significant older adult Medicare Advantage population. We do have a payer arm within our IDN, but again, as of today, it's a very small part of the overall system.

## Client
It makes total sense. I just wanted to clarify that because that obviously changes the direction I would potentially take the call, but understood. Let's focus largely on the provider function. I think I can probably read between the lines because you just mentioned that you're largely serving Medicare Advantage population, but for what payment schemes does your organization use risk adjustment today?

## Expert
Some of our value-based care contracts, even though we do have the small payer arm, we are networked with many other health plans that our members are members of. We use risk adjustment really to identify those gaps in care that allow us to deal accurately, but also, more importantly, make sure that we identify any risk for those patients with some of those gaps. Let's say, for example, missing a blood pressure check, that's pretty much the big one, or have they had their vitals read in the last six months? Have they had a PCP visit?

We utilize the risk platform to make sure that we check off all the boxes for that Medicare population. Some of the Medicaid plans, which we also care for, Medicaid patients have some risk adjustment needs as well. The platform that we use really helps us capture those gaps, fill them, document appropriately and efficiently, and also make sure, if we are audited by other health plans, that we are in compliance with some of those measures.

## Client
What percentage of your care population generally is under a value-based care contract that requires you to do risk adjustment?

## Expert
I'd say right now about 60%.

## Client
Okay, so large portion of your population. Would most of these fall under traditional Medicare Advantage?

## Expert
Yeah. Of that population, I'd say 30% are traditional Medicare, 50%, 55%, probably Medicare Advantage, and the rest are with a managed Medicaid plan.

## Client
When patients within this cohort take traditional Medicare, why is risk adjustment relevant to those patients?

## Expert
If it's just traditional Medicare without a Medicare Advantage plan, as a provider, we are part of an ACO. The ACO that we are part of focuses on those traditional Medicare fee-for-service patients that are not part of a Medicare Advantage plan. In that ACO, we have some deliverables and measures that we have to hit. Though they are not Medicare Advantage members per se, the fact that they're part of this ACO and risk adjustment is part of the overall mix in terms of how we are held accountable, that also helps with our [stratification]. This is why we have these risk reduction measures in place just for the traditional Medicare fee-for-service population.

## Client
I see. When you're working with a Medicare Advantage plan, they're effectively facilitating the risk-taking. They're paying you capitation rate per patient and you have to do the risk adjustment to determine the payment rate. For the portion for which the risk is not facilitated by the patient's plan, you guys are electing to take the risk as an ACO?

## Expert
Correct. Last year was our first year to get into a full risk with these ACOs, let that glide past, and now have the up and downside risk. You're correct in your assessment that these ACO members, which are majority Medicare fee-for-service, there are certain measures that we are accountable for. Therefore, the risk adjustment platform is really critical for us to continue to stay on that ACO program and make sure that we're able to take care of these patients.

## Client
Makes total sense. When you guys are running your ACO, do you utilize an enablement platform, or are you guys effectively managing the risk in-house?

## Expert
No. Up until about two years ago, we did a lot of the work in-house. Now we have an external partner that helps us.

## Client
Who is the external partner?

## Expert
Cotiviti.

## Client
Got it. You're taking a lot of risk, so risk adjustment is going to be super relevant to you. Let's go through each use case. Let's say you're working with a Medicare Advantage plan. Ultimately, the rate they're getting paid by Medicare, by the CMS, is determined on their member population's health status. To understand their member population's health status, to do their own risk adjustment, they have to get the claims data from the underlying providers, like yourself, to be able to do that risk adjustment.

Do you also, when you're working with Medicare Advantage plan, have to do your own risk adjustment to determine what they pay you? Can you just effectively submit the claim for payment and then they pay you whatever they determine based on their own model? Do you understand what I'm asking? They do the work versus you do the work?

## Expert
I understand completely. We know, working with the Medicare Advantage member population, there are certain criteria. I use care gaps as an example because that's actually the easiest to measure and that's where a majority of the risk is for us in terms of how our [conduct] is designed with the MA plan. For example, let's say there are five care gaps that a patient needs to have checked off during the calendar year. Whatever contractual timeline we have within our contract, we know that if all those care gaps are met, all five, we already know what we'll get paid. It's already predetermined on the contract. We know that if only three of the five are met, we'll get X amount.

Let's say we have 50,000 members with this particular Medicare Advantage plan. They each have five care gaps that they need to be met. This is where it gets really complicated to measure and follow because 50,000 MA members, five care gaps per member, you're going to have some that will be five for five. You'll have some that historically, based on claims experience, 1/5, 2/5, just don't engage with their PCP or specialist. This is where these groups like a Cotiviti, risk adjustment platform, come into play. It helps us measure performance.

To answer your question is we will know exactly, based on how many gaps we fill and what percentage of the population meet those measures, what our payment will be at the end of the cycle. There's no unknown. We know exactly that if we hit this, and this percentage of population meet this, then we will receive Y, if that makes sense.

It's all in the contractual arrangements. At the end of the day, we have to hit these care gaps anyway. That's really, at the end of the day, for the clinical positive outcomes for the patient. That's how, as a provider, we are judged, in terms of how we are able to meet those care gaps and improve the clinical quality for those members. In this example, those 50,000 members that are part of this MA plan.

## Client
I think I'm actually asking even more basic questions, so that all makes sense to me. Forget about your ACO business. Let's just focus on the patient population that's covered under a Medicare Advantage plan. This is a really elementary question, I admit, but I actually don't know the answer.

If you, VNA, you're the healthcare provider, and you have a patient show up at your doorstep that has a Medicare Advantage plan, I know that plan is getting paid in a capitation model by CMS based on that patient's risk score. Are you paid the pass-through? Are you guys paid a capitation rate for that patient as well? Under Medicare Advantage, when you're not taking risk as the provider, you're just billing fee-for-service. No?

## Expert
Correct. I understand the question. CMS, based on the risk, based on where this patient resides, by zip code, the Medicare Advantage plan is getting a PMPM, per member per month, for that patient. Let's say, simple math, $500 a month, PMPM. My example earlier, let's just make it easy, all these 50,000 members live in the same two zip codes, all receiving X amount of dollars a month. The Medicare Advantage plan will say, "Okay, we're receiving X amount, about $4 a month, from CMS number per month." We will work with the Medicare Advantage plan and take care of this. We will receive a percentage. It could be 25%, it could be half. Usually, it's not half, it's a little too much.

Let's just say we'll receive $150 if we hit all these different measurements, all these different care gaps. I oversimplify it, there might be some different things depending on the specific conditions, but let's make it just very clean, 50,000 members in these two zip codes. The Medicare Advantage plan is receiving X amount PMPM per member. We work with the plan, and they say, "Okay, of these members that are assigned to you, if you hit these deliverables, care gaps, physical annual visits, wellness check, all that, you're going to receive a part of that capitation rate."

In this example, of the $400, we'll probably get, let's say, $150. That is pretty much how the basic nuances of the program work. Of the 50,000, if we see an improvement in 80% of these patients coming in to, let's say, see the doc, you receive an additional bonus, whatever that might be. That's pretty much how the program works for us.

They receive a capitation, i.e., the health plan, PMPM. Of that PMPM, we're going to get a piece of that, and based on specific criteria, measurements that we hit, we will get an additional bonus. I pretty much oversimplified it, but that is pretty much the basic concept of how our group, as well as other providers in that space, will get paid. It is off that CMS rate. Of that rate, the plan will allocate some to us as long as we meet that predetermined criteria.

## Client
Got it. That's different than fee-for-service.

## Expert
Again, we have some members that are straight fee-for-service. Let's say they come in for an annual wellness visit, it's $220. We'll bill for $220, and maybe we'll get $190. is the same, a little bit, but we already know upfront what the payment will be. We know for this procedure or the visit, it'll be covered, let's say 90%. That's pretty much fee-for-service.

There is no incentive, there is no bonus, there is no additional dollars based on clinical quality, and if you took the blood pressure or not. It's just, "Here's the visit. Services were rendered. We send you the bill." Again, the visit was $200, and we received $180. That's the straight fee-or-service. The difference is really, there is no focus on quality. There's no focus on any care gaps. It's just, visit completed, billed, claim paid, off we go.

## Client
I understand your point. When you are contracting with Medicare Advantage plans, so long as you address the care gaps, you already know you're going to get paid a certain rate. In that sense, it is similar to fee-for-service.

## Expert
In that realm example, correct. The difference is we are held accountable for the quality and those care gaps. Again, if we hit 2/5 or 3/5, the payment will be adjusted accordingly. If we don't hit a certain percentage of the population, my example earlier, 50,000, if we don't even hit 30,000, half bonus payments will be adjusted accordingly. That's the spiff there with the VBC world.

## Client
Got it. In this realm, the ACO makes perfect sense to me because it's literally just you're getting the capitation payment, and then you guys are managing the risk. In this model, why do you have to risk adjust under Medicare Advantage when you are paid via a plan?

## Expert
The risk adjustment comes into play where we want to be able to predict how much it's going to cost us, in this case, the provider group or the payer, how much it'll cost us for future care. For example, you come in to see a patient, you have those five criteria or two criteria. Based on the claims, based on the code that we submit, we are adjusting the risk. Risk adjustment really, in my opinion, it's a fancy way of saying that we are billing accordingly and appropriately. We're not under-billing and we're not over-billing. We're billing appropriately and accordingly. That's fair to the provider and to the payer.

In that situation, if everything is fair, accountable, and appropriate in terms of the billing and the claims, then that helps the payer determine the future risk of that patient. It's hard for me to describe it on a whiteboard. If I know that, for example, I am taking care of these three different measures or I've diagnosed this person's true blood pressure level or cholesterol level, it's appropriate and aligned, I'm submitting it. This helps the payer, as well as the provider, judge and/or mitigate risk if that makes sense.

I think in the past, some of these measures were not really ignored. Many times people would go in, and they wouldn't get, for example, surprisingly, a routine BP check. It would not be done. If they're diabetic, certain tests were not done. It was just straight, "Come on in, here's an office visit, we're going to send a bill and a claim, and that was it." Unfortunately, that way led to a lot more high-risk and additional chronic conditions.

The risk adjustment allows us to really fairly and accurately determine this patient's risk. That of helps us then determine potential payment or risk for ER stay, hospitalization, increase in the specific medication utilization, those things. I know I'm babbling on it because it's hard for me to describe, but that's pretty much the way the risk adjustment helps us in determining the patient's true characteristics, so we know how much it will cost to treat them in the long run.

## Client
Is the way to think about it, you use risk adjustment, you will use the HCC standards for determining patient risk scores for your own care population, for the purpose of internal population health management and quality control, quality management? Am I understanding that correctly? It's for you guys to manage your own care population. The need for risk adjustment is not as acute for you guys when you're getting paid through a plan, as it is when you are the ACO, in which case you literally have to do the risk adjustment to get paid, as I understand it. In this instance, this is really for population health management. Is that a fair summary?

## Expert
Yeah. It's for population health management. It's to mitigate risk. It's to determine who are the high-risk, most vulnerable patients within our patient population. We know that those are the patients that will generate the majority of the cost. It helps us risk stratify and, again, forecast potential cost, forecast potential ER visits or hospitalizations, and do our best to mitigate and manage the risk. You're spot on. I just gave you a long answer pretty much to support your question or your claim, but that's pretty much right.

We're just trying to figure out internally how to mitigate the risk for those patients on that spectrum that need to be engaged with more so than not. How can we work with them to make sure that they're receiving the quality of care so that their risk does not increase, which then leads to additional costs, medical expense, hospitalizations, ER, those things that could be avoided?

## Client
I understand now. There's retrospective risk adjustment, prospective risk adjustment. If you're a health plan, each year you need to submit your risk adjustment package to the regulators to determine your capitation rates. As I understand it, you are going to look at the claims data that has been submitted by the underlying providers. For a certain portion of your population, there are going to be patients who are dark, who have these gaps that you're talking about.

Retrospectively, to fill those gaps, usually using either internally or using an outsourced provider, they're going to go back to providers and try to get a hold of the charts, code the charts, and try to fill in the blanks where they don't have the data because either the member was treated at another plan, or there was something in the note that they were treated out of network, or there was something in the note that is more valuable than the claims data that can help them determine a higher score, etc. That's all because the plan doesn't have the chart. If you're a provider and you guys have the chart, then what actually is the risk adjustment? When you're paying Cotiviti, what are you paying them to do?

## Expert
We're paying them to really manage the platform and make sure that we stay on top of all the various care gaps or measures or items that we need to report back to the plan. It's a combination of making sure that "Here are all the patients that we care for, here are all the patients that perhaps are part of an ACO, part of a value-based contract with this Medicare Advantage plan."

It helps us really stay on track and measure the various care gaps that are outstanding, the engagements with the providers, the conditions, and then helps us, pretty much, take our entire patient population, and then risk stratify. Again, if I had a board, the top of the pyramid would be all the high-risk generating majority of the spend, and then it works its way down. That's what Cotiviti does for us.

In the past, we did that manually and also utilized our EMR. Most EMR systems out there do not have that module or capability to do risk adjustments. It's more about notes, it's more about medication management. When you're talking about putting together a report and then doing data analytics, and also in some ways predicting risk, and/or predicting, let's say, an ER visit or a hospital stay, that's where groups like Cotiviti come into play.

They can provide a lot of the data analytics, the algorithms, and then take our entire population with all the different claims and then help us engage with that patient accordingly. That's what they bring to the table. Again, before, we were doing all that pretty much on our own.

## Client
Got it. When you say certain measures that you need to report back to the plans, what does that mean?

## Expert
It seems simple, but it's not. one) Have all the patients that you've seen had an annual wellness visit versus a physical? Those are two different things. An AWV is not as long as the annual physical, but some plans will require you to have at least two of those for each individual. That's one measure. two) When was the last time you took this individual's blood pressure? three) Another big measure, which has become more prevalent over the last three years is, have they had a cancer screening?

Depending on the plan, there are probably three to five measures that the plan, based on their claims trends, view as high-profile, high-priority that they then expect the provider to address with that patient when we have the provider-patient encounter. Different plans may have a different top three, top five. For us, whatever those top five are, it's up to us as a provider group to make sure that we address those measures when we are seeing that patient in the medical office or in the comfort of their home.

## Client
I see. Tell me if this is a fair understanding of this. Given what I outlined previously, let's say I didn't require you. Let's say I'm Humana and I'm contracting with you. We have a value-based care contract, and I don't make you, VNA, submit any of this data. I'm just working off of the claims data. I run the risk if the claims data does not have, for example, whether the patient's blood pressure was recorded. That wouldn't necessarily be encompassed in a claim. That would be in the chart. If you don't send me this report, I have to effectively pay someone to go and get the chart and abstract the chart.

## Expert
Correct. We have this too within our system. The Medicare Advantage plan, let's say Humana, they have 10,000, or this is my example earlier, 50,000 members that are assigned to us. We are responsible for those members and those patients, of course. Towards the end of the year is usually when risk adjustment really takes another higher level of activities because now you're in the last quarter of the year. This is where the payer will look at you, "Wait a minute. Of the 50,000 members assigned to this provider group, we have 15,000 members that haven't even come in to see the doc. We don't have anything on BP check, on medication management, annual wellness visit."

This is where a group like a Humana or another big player, like a UnitedHealthcare, they will reach out to the provider group and say, "Wait a minute, these 15,000 patients, you haven't even seen them, and it's already October, November." They'll do a couple of things.

They'll say, "Okay, provider group, you need to find a way to engage these patients, call them, bringing them in before the end of the calendar year," or the provider group, in your example, Humana, will call, let's say house calls practice and say, "Here we have 15,000 members, they haven't engaged with their PCP over here. We need you to deploy and call these patients, or we'll also call on your behalf to make it easy for them. We're at the end of the calendar year, we're going to ask you to call them and provide a wellness visit in the comfort of their own home."

You take the BP check, you take the vitals, and you do the cancer screening. That's how it's been working the last five years with these value-based contracts and AWVs. This is why house calls practices providers have really come to the forefront, because if it's October, November, or first week of December, most likely, patients are not going to come into the clinic or to the hospital or to the office. We need to bring the doctor to them. This is how now that house call provider can go to the home and then close those gaps.

The last four or five years, it's been really crazy with house call providers increasing level of activity because now you're at the end of the line, you only have a month or so left to close those gaps. You haven't been able to engage with them almost in 11 months. Now, we're going to bring the care to you, and we'll try and close all those gaps so that we at least those 15,000 members, patients I gave earlier as an example, hopefully, we can get at least 10,000 of those 15,000.

Again, if we don't hit those members, there are certain dollars lost. Of course, the health plan, in this case, the MA plan, will also lose dollars from CMS. It's a crazy cycle every 12 months because, at the end of the year, it's important to try and get all these AWVs and visits taken care of. This is why these house call providers really have come to the forefront. They're the ones that can go out there and close those gaps on behalf of the help plan.

## Client
That all makes sense. Here's what I'm trying to figure out. See, this is where I'm struggling. I'm trying to figure out how large the market is for risk adjustment. I'm also trying to just understand some of these dynamics. When you say that a patient has a care gap, that's very different than when a plan says a patient has a care gap.

When a plan says one of their members has a care gap, as I understand it, what it means is, we have a patient, for example, that saw their primary care provider 10 times in a year, and last year they saw that provider once. The patient has a family history of cancer, but none of the claims from these 10 visits say anything about cancer. If we're a plan, if we're getting paid more for covering higher-risk patients, we need to make sure that this patient is in the proper risk bucket so that we can get the right capitation rate.

To fill that gap, we need to hire Cotiviti to go call VNA, give us the chart, make sure that we were coding correctly, and get all the information. When you say there's a care gap, it means there's literally a care gap, that is the patient has not been to the doctor to have XYZ check. First of all, am I understanding this right?

## Expert
Correct. At the end of the day, there's a gap on that member or patient, but you're spot on. The payer is looking at it from one perspective, and we're looking at it from another perspective. There's a gap in care. The payer may not necessarily know what those gaps are because they don't have access to the chart. This is where Cotiviti comes into play and some of the other big players in that space.

You have the provider perspective on that care gap, and you have the payer perspective. We're both aligned to do what's best for the patient, to make sure that those care gaps being closed can help improve the clinical outcome for that member, i.e., patient. You're definitely spot-on in what you're saying. Just we're looking at it from different perspectives.

At the end of the day, the patient is missing something, either from the chart, or they're missing a gap where the plan says, to your example earlier, "This patient has cancer and, wow, it's already December 7th, and this person has not had a cancer screening in all of 2024, all of 2025. That's a darn problem." It's just different perspective, different hat. The payer hat or the provider hat. Both, the patient is at risk because we're just defining the gap based on the patient lens versus the payer lens. We have risk on both sides, but different types of risk. The risk is the health plan and the CMS not receiving appropriate payment, capitation, for this high-risk cancer patient.

The risk for us is the payer will say, "You know what, you guys are not taking care of this patient. We're moving this patient away from you, and plus, we're not going to pay you." Again, just depending on how you look at it, which different lens, they're both negative outcomes, but we just have a different accountability.

At the end of the day, the patient is the one that's going to suffer because they have cancer. They're not getting a screen, they're not having their AWV, not having their blood pressure checked. At the end of the day, we're aligned. He or she is at risk, but we have different negative results and impact to deal with, the payer CMS, the provider, and the Medicare Advantage payer plan.

## Client
Makes perfect sense. Now that I have a much better understanding of this, very helpful, let's transition the discussion to talking about how this works from a vendor perspective and how tactically you're doing this. Let's focus on your ACO business. Your ACO business requires that you actually do the patient risk scores for submission to the CMS, correct?

## Expert
For the PMPM service, correct.

## Client
You guys obviously are coding the charts for just normal revenue cycle management purposes. When it comes time to submit the package to the CMS, are you guys doing the HCC coding as well, or have you outsourced that to Cotiviti?

## Expert
Cotiviti is doing the coding, the checking. We have a two-pronged approach just to make sure that we're accurate. We actually have our own internal coders, and then Cotiviti is auditing or spot-checking before it's actually sent to CMS to make sure that the coding is appropriate and accurate. We have two lines, our own internal coding team, and then the Cotiviti coding team to do a checks and balances before the actual claim is submitted to CMS.

## Client
It sounds like, forget what percentage of your care population is relevant for risk adjustment. It seems like there could be a benefit to doing a patient risk score for your entire care population. Obviously, it's most important for your ACO business because it's how you get paid directly.

It's probably important for Medicare Advantage because you want to make sure that you're managing to these contracts correctly and that you're managing the risk correctly. It's not super, super important, I don't think, because you still get paid. Even for traditional fee-for-service patients under commercial contracts or something, it would be helpful to have this risk score. Will you do risk adjustment for your entire member population or just a subset?

## Expert
No, we started doing it for the entire population a couple years ago, which led us to partner with a company like Cotiviti. We know that we have about 6% of our patients in some type of VBC. Two years ago, we were probably at 20%. We know that needle is going to move over to a point where, probably, I'm guessing in three years, we'll be at about 85%.

It behooves us for these patients, whether they're part of an ACO or part of a VBC plan with a Medicare Advantage plan, in preparation, of course, to do what's best for the patient with their clinical quality, to do a risk adjustment and determine a risk score for all those patients that we serve. Eventually, a majority of these patients, 85/100, will be in some kind of plan.

If we do the legwork now, we'll be better equipped to handle this when the time comes. Again, based on our contracting opportunities and some of the VBC opportunities that will be coming down for more of the specialty care. Again, a majority of our patients will be in some type of ACO and/or Medicare Advantage VBC. That's why we're doing the risk score for everybody today, regardless if they're part of the ACO or not.

That Medicare fee-for-service bucket has declined over the last five to 10 years. Many of those folks are gravitating towards a Medicare Advantage plan. The growth is not as high as it was three, five, seven years ago. There's going to be a point in time when we're not going to have a lot of folks gravitating towards a Medicare Advantage plan. Some will just stay with their Medicare and a supp plan.

Either way, they will be part of an ACO because that's where the world is moving towards. This is why a company like Cotiviti can help us prepare, and this is why we do that risk adjustment for pretty much all of the patients that we serve today, regardless if they're part of an ACO or VBC plan or not.

## Client
When you're an ACO, that's only relevant to traditional Medicare.

## Expert
At least for the ones that we are participating in, yes. You've heard of ACO REACH? Those are just straight Medicare fee-for-service. They're not part of a Medicare Advantage plan. As you know, a member cannot be part of a Medicare Advantage plan as well as an ACO. These are straight Medicare fee-for-service patients, correct.

## Client
Understood. Again, let's focus back on the ACO business. How much do you pay Cotiviti? How do you pay them? Is it per record that they code or check or whatever?

## Expert
Yes. When we negotiated the contract, again, we went from doing everything internal to outsourcing pretty much 90% of the business. 10% is our team that's doing the coding as a two-part approach. We don't pay a per member per fee, so negotiated a flat fee. Currently, we're paying in the millions for Cotiviti. Quite frankly, it's a bargain for us. It's our look into that space to see how it would work when we renew the contract, which is a three-year contract. We have one more year to go. We will probably have to go to a PMPM or every file that goes through.

This was an opportunity for us to get our feet wet and just have them prove that they can support and help us, which they have. They've done a fantastic job. I know some other systems have this flat admin-type, annual subscriber-type thing. That's what we have today. It's not a per head, per patient, per member, it's just a flat fee. That will definitely change once our contract's up in another 12 months or so.

## Client
Understood. You will pay them some blended rate for your entire care population, PMPM, you think?

## Expert
Yeah, we will. This gives us a chance to really take it out for a spin, get our providers and our team oriented. Again, we used to do this on our own, and we were missing a lot of gaps. The system that we used, which was homegrown, became obsolete. Eventually, we will have this probably a small admin fee, but more of a per-member-per-head schedule. It'll be based on tiers if we hit a certain level, based on growth. That'll perhaps come again come renewal time, but for now, it's just a flat admin fee.

## Client
Awesome. The reason why I'm asking is I think these guys, they probably have various payment models. I've typically heard per chart. You would pay them to look at how many charts, but I guess you don't want to do that because you're going to have them look at every chart.

## Expert
Yeah. If we did it that way, we would be spending a lot more than $2 million. That's why this is our opportunity to take it for a spin. They've great to work with, but eventually, it'll be a per chart, or it'll be a PMPM. This gives us a chance to see what will be the best pathway once our contract is up for renewal. We're still trying to figure that out. The per chart is the typical schedule of payment that Cotiviti and some of the other groups have out there. We're still trying to figure that out.

## Client
Have you evaluated other vendors?

## Expert
Yeah. We looked at Optum, we looked at Annova. Annova is another one, Episource, but those are the top four, and, of course, Cotiviti. Cotiviti's system integrates well with our EMR. That was a huge plus. They were the only ones who would work with us and not have us focus on a per-chart fee initially. They were willing to work with us, a glide path and just do an admin fee, which is a huge plus for us because it gives us a chance to get implementation and get acclimated to the program.

The others, all very good platforms. It's just that they wanted, from the beginning, to do either a per chart or PMPM, and I just wasn't ready for that yet. This is another reason why we decided to go to Cotiviti. They seem to be more flexible in their schedule.

## Client
Right. Looking on your website, it sounds like your patient population is something like 80,000.

## Expert
Actually, that's just for one of our FQHCs within our system. We have about 360,000.

## Client
Got it. I'm thinking, 360,000, if you were paying them per chart, doing it once a year, you pay them $5-$10 a chart. That'd be $1.8 million-$3.6 million if they were going to do everyone. That's $2.5 million in the middle there. That makes sense to me. Am I thinking about that the right way? Is it going to be somewhere in that range that you're going to pay them going forward? You made it sound like it's going to go way up. Are you pulling the charts? Are you having them code the charts more than once a year? Is there some other fee that I'm missing?

## Expert
No. Again, we'll see how the next year goes. I expect if we have them pull all the charts, it'll be done more than once in some cases. We'll probably close to that the few millions mark in annual spend. I don't remember how I calculated last time, but we look at X amount of charts being pulled. We are also bringing on another group here, which will increase our patient base. I'm thinking it'll be just about a few million. Not quite double where we are today, but pretty darn close.

There's a misnomer. People think they're just going to pull a chart one time. Because we're an IDN, we have patients that are seeing various providers within our IDN. They might be seeing our primary care physician, seeing a cardiologist, seeing an oncologist. It's hard for me to describe, but that chart is not just being pulled one time if that makes sense. Especially if you have a patient that is utilizing three or four different specialties within the health system, that chart can be pulled multiple times.

We have also a home care division, so that has another mix to it. This is why we have a pretty darn good deal right now. I expect once we recalculate everything and go into maybe an admin fee plus PMPM or chart, it will be almost double. The ROI will still offset that, but the cost will definitely not double, but pretty darn close to it.

## Client
Got it. Are you going to have Cotiviti do your coding? That's HCC coding for the purpose of risk adjustment. Are you going to have them also do your coding for just the charts to submit to the plan?

## Expert
We probably will. We have some of the coding functions internally in-house. They will do the HCC coding and they will do the spot check on the overall coding. The answer to your question is yes, that will happen here eventually, correct. Right now, no, but eventually they will. That plays into the fees adjusting once we go down that pathway.

## Client
Right. You think that's in addition to the few million?

## Expert
The few million will capture that. That's already been discussed. We just haven't really pulled the trigger on that, but that will be part of the overall.

## Client
Okay. How do I think about this? What I'm trying to figure out is, what portion of that is risk adjustment, and what portion of that is just doing your RCM, like your regular coding, your ICD-10 coding?

## Expert
We have our own RCM separate. Cotiviti has some, as you know, RCM functions. When all is said and done, Cotiviti will be about 75% risk and value-based. The 25% will be an additional RCM support. That's how I envision it once we pull. It'll be a 75/25 split. The RCM is also obviously a big revenue driver for us, so it will help us with accuracy with the coding, but it'll be about a 75/25 split. 75%, of course, will be a majority of the risk adjustment, the analytics, the risk stratification.

That 25% will be probably overkill on the RCM, but that's okay because that's what generates the revenues. That's what improves the accounts payable or accounts receivable timeline. That will be additional support, but it'll definitely be a majority, maybe even 80% risk with Cotiviti. Their components definitely will help the RCM side of the business. No doubt.

## Client
This is not perfect, but I'm just trying to get to a rate I can use to just try to extrapolate what this would look like if you would apply it to the broader market. If you're telling me 2/4 or 3/4 of the contract, at least, is for value-based, that's at least one out of few million. If your patient population is 360,000, and coding that population costs $5-$10 a pop, then for most of them, you are just pulling it once a year. For vast preponderance, you're pulling it once a year.

## Expert
For now, perhaps. I know that when we look at some of the analytics there, again, because of the specialty care utilization, many charts are being pulled multiple times. I just don't know the breakdown. When all is said and done, we'll be paying more. The bottom line is the ROI will offset that. I see you trying to break down the math and make it simple, which goes into one bucket. I get it. Just, again, without the whiteboard, it's hard for me to explain. The risk piece, that's in of itself, the ROI there, compared to what we're doing before, is significant.

## Client
For sure. Look, if you're paying $5, $10 a chart and if you can manage the risk right, on a patient where you're getting paid $500 a month, it's a total no-brainer. I totally get it. Maybe one thing that's just helpful as we end this. The plans, it's very easy. If I want to understand how big this market is for the plans, I would talk to them, ask for how many patients do you have? What's the HCC coding cost per chart that you need to pull? What percentage of the charts do you need to pull? The rest you can just do internally using your SQL database for free, effectively, because they map the claims codes, the ICD-10 codes, the HCC codes. That's super easy.

It's like, "Okay, how many covered lives are there under Medicare Advantage and the ACA Marketplace and Medicaid, times the percentage, times $5-$10s. Okay, there you go." How do I figure this out for providers? How do I go about figuring out how many providers have a majority at risk that they would want to do something like this?

## Expert
I would say the last two or three years, I don't know if it'll help answer your question, there's a lot of focus on getting provider groups to enter into the VBC space. The Medicare fee-for-service space, or fee-for-service in general, that's going away. I would say today in the U.S. marketplace, and I'm talking maybe 20 providers or more, I would say maybe about 50% are in some kind of value-based care model, ACO or whatever.

That number will probably go, as I mentioned before, like us, 80% to 85% in the next three years. I don't think the providers yet understand that these Cotivitis can really help them. They're doing what we were doing before. We were doing our own risk adjustment and manual and utilizing the EMR.

The provider opportunity landscape for a company like Cotiviti or Annova is huge because there's still many groups out there that are still doing this on their own, utilizing their EMR as the reservoir of the information of the claims. Many payers are utilizing a Cotiviti, Annova, Optum. The provider space is still, in my opinion, in its infancy stages. Not that it's untapped, it's just that a lot of providers are still fighting because they thought VBC was going to go away, and it's not. The health plans are ahead of the game, health systems, IDNs like us are ahead.

These provider groups, 10, 15, 20 providers, many are still utilizing an Excel spreadsheet and their EMR. This is where a company like Cotiviti, Annova, they have a lot of upside because they haven't even hit peak with these provider groups out there. Many of them, again, are still utilizing their own internal homegrown platform, like we did up until two years ago. They're doing that today. The sky's the limit there.

I will be surprised if more than 50% of the groups out there, and I'm talking 20 providers or more, are utilizing some kind of risk adjustment platform because they don't know any better yet. Eventually, they'll have to compete in a VBC world or ACO because they just do not have the technology or platform to track all these measurements by MA plan. It's almost impossible to do so. To invest in doing that on your own as opposed writer group is just insane. This is where the Cotivitis will provide a solution, but, again, I think that provider side of the house is still untapped.

## Client
There's also been this movement towards outsourcing your coding function for RCM generally. Let's say you use a Waystar today, or someone, R1, or something like that, why wouldn't you just use them for this? That's not a question for you, that's like, I have to think about that. From my perspective, I have to sharpen my pencil on thinking about how the provider landscape adopts this technology.

You guys are clearly first movers, but it's also because 60% of your population is at risk. You guys have clearly embraced this. A lot of organizations are not going to embrace this as much, or have not historically embraced this as much. As they do, do they look to a Cotiviti, or do they look to their existing RCM provider to help them with the coding and the risk stratification? I don't know the answer to that.

## Expert
I think some of these Waystars, the Epics, which is our EMR, there's some risk adjustment templates on there, but nowhere near the level of Annova or Cotiviti. Again, I think that's where the Cotivitis, the sky's the limit. These RCMs, they can do some of the coding, but it's the risk mitigation, risk stratification, the open gap closures, gaps in care.

Many of them don't have those functionalities within RCM. You submit the bill. Is the code correct? You submit the claim. That's what they do. As far as the coding, they can get that coding, but some of these more clinical things, checking to see, with the BP, blood pressure, check, that's not really part of the RCM platform. Some have it, but it's not really consistent. These risk adjustment companies, that's all they do. They have a huge opportunity where the Waystars can only do so much, just like an EMR, but they can't really take you to the finish line. That's just my opinion.

## Client
This was great. Thank you so much for the help.
