## Slide 2: What we're building

What we're building

**Machine learning to replace every genetic test**

## Slide 3: Market

Market

If we could predict and prevent common diseases, insurers would save **$1 trillion+** in yearly healthcare spend.

This is why insurers already cover clinical genetic tests.

## Slide 4: Problem

Problem

Current clinical tests miss the vast majority of genetic signal because they cannot model the function of non-coding DNA

**Coding DNA**
*   natera
*   Ambry Genetics
*   color
*   Myriad genetics
*   INVITAE

**Non-coding DNA**
90% of causal genetic variants for common disease are actually found in the non-coding genome

## Slide 5: Solution

Solution

Martingale Labs' models enable us to unlock 10x the genetic data of our competitors for the first time

**Summary of Key Results**

We sequenced your whole genome and computed disease risks for the following conditions based on methods indicated by published research and our proprietary data.

Your genetic data indicates an increased risk for some of the conditions we tested for, indicated by "high" risk in red. Results below indicate potential future risk, and cannot diagnose any of these conditions. Results should be interpreted within the context of additional laboratory results, family history and clinical findings.

| Condition    | Lifetime Risk | Percentile | Risk Level |
| :----------- | :------------ | :--------- | :--------- |
| Breast Cancer | 24.5%         | 98th       | HIGH       |

**Additional Results**

Your genetic data does not indicate an increased risk for the following conditions. Results below indicate potential future risk, and cannot diagnose any of these conditions. Results should be interpreted within the context of additional laboratory results, family history and clinical findings.

| Condition         | Lifetime Risk | Percentile | Risk Level |
| :---------------- | :------------ | :--------- | :--------- |
| Bladder Cancer    | 3.0%          | 87th       | NORMAL     |
| Ovarian Cancer    | 1.2%          | 71st       | NORMAL     |
| Endometrial Cancer | 3.0%          | 66th       | NORMAL     |

### Martingale Labs: Breast Cancer Report

**Understand Your High Risk**

**24.5%**
Lifetime risk of developing Breast Cancer
You are 1.9x as likely as the general population to develop Breast Cancer.

You are at the **98th percentile of risk** compared to others with European ancestry. This means that you are more at risk for Breast Cancer than 98% of others with your ancestry.

**How did we determine your risk?**
We analyzed your whole genome and found variants in your DNA also present in the DNA of people of your background who developed Breast Cancer. Select variants that we determined to be most causal of your risk assessment are shown below.

| Marker Tested           | Genotype | Additional Information                                                               |
| :---------------------- | :------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Chromosome: 9 Position: 98078727 | GG       | This is a variant in the coding region of the FANCC gene. FANCC encodes the protein Fanconi anemia |

## Slide 11: Progress

Progress

Since incorporating 6 months ago, we...

*   built a HIPAA-compliant **product**, including modeling & infrastructure
*   filed **3 provisional patents**
*   initiated IRB-approved trials on **real patients**
*   obtained LOIs from hospital systems and health insurer

## Slide 12: Traction

Traction

A top hospital system plans to offer our test beginning in April 2023

"Martingale Labs's **groundbreaking new approach** to predictive genetic testing has the potential to help millions of Americans receive better preventative care, and to ultimately save their lives."

## Slide 13: Market

Market

Health insurance reimbursement of clinical genetic tests already represents a $116 billion US market...

**$13.3K** (insurance reimbursement per test based on CMS '22 clinical schedule)
**× 8.8M** (genetic tests in US / year)
**= $116 billion** (annual US revenue opportunity)

... with additional expansion opportunity in testing volume, pharma, and international

## Slide 14: GTM

GTM

Distribution requires parallel execution of two proven playbooks:

**Hospital System and Provider Sales**
**Insurance Coverage and Contracts**
***CPT codes and process already exist**

## Slide 18: xkcd Comic

**Panel 1:**
BIOLOGY IS LARGELY SOLVED.
DNA IS THE SOURCE CODE FOR OUR BODIES. NOW THAT GENE SEQUENCING IS EASY, WE JUST HAVE TO READ IT.
IT'S NOT JUST "SOURCE CODE." THERE'S A TON OF FEEDBACK AND EXTERNAL PROCESSING.

**Panel 2:**
BUT EVEN IF IT WERE, DNA IS THE RESULT OF THE MOST AGGRESSIVE OPTIMIZATION PROCESS IN THE UNIVERSE, RUNNING IN PARALLEL AT EVERY LEVEL, IN EVERY LIVING THING, FOR FOUR BILLION YEARS.
IT'S STILL JUST CODE.

**Panel 3:**
OK, TRY OPENING GOOGLE.COM AND CLICKING "VIEW SOURCE."
OK, I-... OH MY GOD.
THAT'S JUST A FEW YEARS OF OPTIMIZATION BY GOOGLE DEVS. DNA IS THOUSANDS OF TIMES LONGER AND WAY, WAY WORSE.
WOW, BIOLOGY IS IMPOSSIBLE.
