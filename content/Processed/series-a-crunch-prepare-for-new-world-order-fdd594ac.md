[Intro]

To our Virtue Founders,

Setting the stage re: “Series A Crunch” - what that entails, what to know, how to prepare, etc.

Do not love providing this type of negative tone however it is realistic

We would not be doing our job if we did not communicate relevant market intel / data, especially that of which may be non-obvious to founders.

It is your #1 job as CEO to never run out of cash.

In recent conversations, far too many of our founders continue to believe they are exceptions to any market correction and continue to expect large valuation-step ups and/or nominal future dilution (e.g. 15%).

Folks require a reality check – we are operating in a new normal - and a new normal that is likely to be ruthless in its reckoning.

Consider yourself forewarned

If you choose not to act then it is in our view that you are putting your company at material disadvantage and significantly increasing your odds of failure and being unable to raise a Series A.

Admittedly, we are prioritizing engagement with our founders who clearly recognize their role in the active management of their capital, respect their capital sources / partners and recognize that any future capital availability is not guaranteed in lieu of measurable performance (us included!).

There are several factors that will contribute to a likely ‘Series A Crunch’ which include but are not limited to:

Longer Investment Periods: 1 Year —> 3-4 Years. GP investment periods during 2020-22 became as low as only 1 year (12 months), especially so for the many of the largest, most reputable venture brands. Historically, investment periods have hovered around 3-4 years. Limited Partners (LPs - they are the institutions that provide GPs (VC) with our capital) are actively drastically reducing their capital supply and mandating that their GPs operate and deploy their current funds on 3-4 year cycles (vs 1-2). So, why do shorter investment periods matter to you? Simply put, longer investment periods == reduced capital supply.

A simple example: say LPs give Virtue $100M to deploy in a 1 year investment period then that means exactly that - we have the next 12 months to deploy $100M and then we re-up for a new fund. However, given the tightening macro environment, LPs will now say ‘Virtue, here is your $100M however we will only give you this $100M if you deploy this amount across a 4 year investment period’. Given that the vast majority of GPs have little leverage here we agree. Extending our investment period to 4 years means that we only have $25M to invest per year (vs $100M) which is equivalent to a 75% drop in available capital supply during any vintage year in our investment period. Now, aggregate this same affect across an entire venture industry - which is happening as we speak - and all of a sudden you are seeing the total available amount of venture capital in any given year drop by 50-75% (consensus estimate) which is expected over 2023-2025. It is critical that you understand this simple yet structurally significant concept - longer investment periods == reduced capital supply. The entire venture market effectively overnight has >50% less capital available today than in the previous years. For instance, Oak HC/FT recently ~$1B fund over a 1 year period across 2021 only for their LPs to re-up but mandate a new 4 investment period. Oak has not yet meaningfully invested out of this new fund out of desire to preserve capital only for the highest quality opportunities.

Ok, but what about all the ‘dry powder’ we keep hearing about? While it is true that VC raised a historical amount of capital in 2021 do not expect that this means VCs will be fast & loose with their capital deployment. A few considerations:

Longer Investment Periods. See above. If you fail to acknowledge this simple dynamic then you are already behind the curve. This simple adjustment is reducing the velocity of venture capital by an order of magnitude & reducing capital supply available in any vintage by upwards of 40-75%.

Funds / Partnerships Are Downsizing. Founders Fund recently announced they are slashing their flagship fund from $1.8B → $900M. This is a significant development representing the first meaningful downsizing of a marquee venture firm and which is sure to see other followers. In several conversations we have had with partnerships at prominent firms in a similar caliber as Founders Fund, every major firm is at least having internal discussions debating whether or not they downsize current fund sizes.

Firms of All Stripes Will Go Under. While it is not expected that we experience a wholesale reduction in the # of total VC firms, we certainly expect firms to go under. For instance, we know of two (2) seed stage healthcare firms who have recently elected not to raise future funds and have chosen to wind down operations. We believe firms most at risk of shutdown are middle-tier Series A/B firms (e.g. have raised $250-500M recent funds but not have any notable portfolio companies and/or marquee presence) or firms where partnerships are older and are choosing not sign up for bear market cycle (and, in general, expect the potential for significant generational GP turnover over the next 2-3 years especially in those firms where partnerships have already achieved several cycles of fund success). Additionally, while painful for us to admit, we also expect many <$50-100M funds to go under who have not taken a disciplined approach to valuation and/or possess no discernible focus and/or comparative advantage. Lastly, expect many of the micro funds (<$15M) and operator led funds to wind down.

If you fail to understand the simple concept of investment periods being lengthened and how this dynamic will dramatically constrict the supply of venture capital then you are putting your business in jeopardy. Every startup in market - from the very best to not-so-best - will be affected by extended investment periods.

KEY TAKEAWAY: The current venture capital market is experiencing a severe crisis of a historically constricted capital supply which is reducing the available amount of venture capital to startups by upwards of 40-75% through 2025. Simply put, there will be less funding available and the cost of venture capital dramatically just shot up.

Multiples.

Bessemer Cloud Index. Currently trading at 7x; expected to get up to 8-10X

Tech-enabled Services. Currently trading at 3-4X; upwards of 5-6X for those models that have been able to achieve >60% gross margins.

If you do not understand how the VC’s investment period affects your business (and the entire VC market for several years to come) then here it is:

Recognizing 2021 Aberration & Continued Regression to Mean

[WHY THIS CAGR IS RELEVANT / METHODOLOGY / HIGHLIGHT TOTAL CAGR VS. SPECIFIC DEALS]

2021 Total Funding Had Massive Increase to Historical Trendline. 2021 was a 61% overall increase in total venture funding based on the expected 12-20 trendline. Most of this ($100B+) was from the increase in $50M+ rounds.

Series A Funding Did NOT Correct in 2022. Based on the expected 2022 total venture funding based on the 12-20 trendline, $5-$10M and $10-$25M rounds (e.g., Series A) are still above the trendline we would expect. Note — this was not the case for digital health Series As.

2020-22 Pre-Seed Drop Off. In addition to having lowest 2012-20 CAGR (1.4%), actual pre-seed deal value (<$1M round size) was 15% lower than expected in 2022 which supports our experience.

2012-20 CAGR: 1.4% (<$1M), 7.5% ($1-5M), 7.1% ($5-10M), 8.7% ($10-25M), 13.5% ($25-50M), 35% ($50M+).

2020 - 2022 Median Seed and Series A Valuations: According to Carta data (report here, addendum here), median seed (<$5M deal size) valuations have been steadily rising while median Series A ($5M-$10M) valuations are dropping back to Q1 2020 levels.

Seed: Median pre-money valuations have been steadily rising over the last 3 years (2.1x from Q1 2020 to Q4) while median cash raised has increased 1.75x during the same time period.

Series A: Median pre-money valuations for Series A increased from $24.0M in Q1 2020 to $50M in Q3 2021 at peak (2.1x) before dropping to $33M in Q4 2022. Median Series A cash raised went through a similar peak and decline, increasing from $8.0M in Q1 2020 to a max of $12.3 before dropping back down to $7.5M in Q4 2022.

Series A Crunch: When the

With the increased demand at the seed stage comes increased valuations. As seed prices steadily rise and Series A prices drop back to Q1 2020 levels (2017-2019 price levels will be good proxy for new market valuations), there is a dislocation in Seed to Series A pricing causing a “Series A Crunch” which is characterized by a logjam of companies unable to raise Series A rounds and where overall valuation levels are largely reset to ‘normal’ market levels.

Practical Considerations & Implications re: Series A Crunch:

Lower valuations.

Lower step-ups.

Note - when determining your multiple step-up, it is measured by your post-money to pre-money. For instance, if you had a $20M post money and raise a $10M Series A at a $50M post ($40M pre-money) then you achieved a 2X step-up ($20M post-money → $40m pre-money).

At the height of the bull market (H2-21) we saw Series A step-ups that would range from 5X-20X. In this new market reset we anticipate most step ups to be 2-3X – anything at >4-5X could be considered top decile.

Higher dilution.

Graduation Rate falls:

2012 - 2019 Graduation Rates. In the prior decade, average seed graduation rates hovered between 32-40% (38% on average) between 2012-2019.

2020 Series A Graduation Rates Were Abnormally High. We saw a 53% Series A graduation rate in 2020 as the Series A market gained pandemic-fueled steam. For purposes of this analysis we assume $1-5M as ‘seed’ though we recognize there was a rise of larger, atypical seed financings between 2019-2022 ($5-25M).

2021-22 Graduation Rates Likely Below Historical Average Rates as the Market Continues to Correct. 2021 saw a graduation rate of 38% but we expect this to drop more as funding for Series A (once data incorporates 2023) continues to correct. We anticipate that 2021 and 2022 seed graduation rates to be as low 20-30%.

LABEL DIGITAL HEALTH

Other Considerations That Would Impact Graduation Rates:

Generalist Allocation Reduction to Healthcare. Furthermore, while we began to see early evidence of a Series A correction in digital health in 2022 (20% drop in graduation rates) we did not see an equivalent graduation rate drop in generalist VC. That said, we anticipate a pullback across the broader venture market which, if true, would suggest a negative impact and lower graduation rate to digital health companies.

Investor sentiment is uncertain & fluctuating rapidly – entire categories (e.g. D2C virtual care have little-to-no Series A investor investor; cos viewed as ‘capital intensive’ are being strongly de-emphasized, etc.).

So What? A Few Practical Next Steps.

We believe in the premise that the #1 Job for any startup CEO is to ensure that your business never runs out of cash. Period. This new market environment will make this job more challenging; however with sufficient advance planning and measurable performance you can (and will) ensure your company has enough cash to survive even the worst market conditions. :

Reduce Cash Burn.

Raise at No Less Than 9 Months Runway. In this new market once you have less than 12 months of runway you are officially in the ‘red zone’ and need to be preparing for an upcoming fundraise. We strongly recommend fundraising at no less than 9 months runway in order to avoid the risk of running out of cash and/or being subject to predatory terms from a Series A investor.

Pressure Test Your Cap Table. It is your responsibility to know if your investors intend to re-invest in your business or not. We suggest that you speak with all of your major and/or institutional investors ASAP to determine whether they are a Yes, TBD, or No when it comes to reinvestment into your business. If ‘TBD’ then understand what actions / progress would garner reinvestment and if ‘No’ take the time to truly understand the reasons your investor does not intend to invest – this should better inform you to take certain actions.

Lines Not Dots. We encourage our teams to develop many Series A investor relationships well in advance of a formal Series A. Given the overwhelming amount of companies expected to raise their Series A in H2-23 - 2024 you cannot afford to show up at an investors door the day you need to cash. Instead, develop relationships early to build a rapport, qualify mutual fit, and allow investors to evaluate lines not dots which can be far stronger than any deck, pitch or data room ever could be.

Regular Investor Updates (More Transparency). Every firm over the last 9 months has been taking a regular audit of their portfolio to determine who they protect (w/ their capital) and who they write off. If you are not top of mind for your investor the odds of you being written off is much higher. This is especially true as the best companies, more experienced founders tend to be excellent communicators, especially during uncertain economic times. We strongly recommend that every Virtue company, especially those that have not achieved PMF and/or hit their Series A milestones, provide regular, transparent updates to their investor base and remain top of mind to their key investors.

Ensure You Are Not Exposed (For Cos that Lack Multi-Stage Investors). If you do not have a multi-stage firm(s) on your cap table with a track record of investing at the Series A round (e.g. all of your investors are seed investors) then it is especially critical that you develop relationships with potential Series A investors well in advance of a formal fundraise.
