# Overview
The expert is the Senior Manager of Procurement at Morgan &#x26; Morgan, the largest personal injury law firm in the United States. They manage a $35M annual spend and over 600,000 annual medical record retrievals. In 2024, they led a consolidation of 75+ vendors down to 9 preferred partners through an RFQ process.

## Vendor Consolidation &#x26; Pricing
The expert’s initiative centralized procurement and enforced standardized pricing (matrix pricing) across vendors. This reduced cost per record from $45 to $26 for the vendor component and to $56 all-in (including HIMC and provider fees). The consolidation produced $17M in annual savings despite a 20% YoY increase in volume. All vendors must comply with fixed pricing, no upcharges, no cancellation fees, and timely invoicing.

## Motivations for Change
The firm faced inflated vendor pricing, delayed billing (sometimes 9–12 months post-case), poor service, and weak compliance from legacy vendors. The shift aimed to regain financial control, ensure faster record turnaround, and reduce administrative friction.

## Operational Workflow
Medical records are requested at the start of nearly every case—typically within hours of client intake. There are three primary retrieval routes:
1. Direct from the provider
2. Through HIMCs such as Ciox, MRO, and ChartSwap
3. Via third-party retrieval vendors such as Lexitas, U.S. Legal, and National Record Retrieval (NRR)

Providers increasingly outsource to HIMCs, making direct access rare, so Morgan &#x26; Morgan relies heavily on API-enabled third-party vendors.

## Technology &#x26; API Use
Third-party vendors such as NRR and Lexitas have invested in API-based intake systems that automate data requests and query HIMC databases electronically. This digital intake replaces manual form entry, significantly reducing latency and human error. By contrast, legacy HIMCs like Ciox still rely on manual request processing despite maintaining large electronic databases.

## Turnaround Times
Turnaround has dropped from 45–60 days to 3–6 days on average. HIPAA allows up to 60 days for record provision, but the firm’s SLA is under one week. API automation and digitized fulfillment (vs. fax/mail) drive this improvement. Third-party vendors process electronically;

# Vendor Ecosystem
Key partners include Lexitas, U.S. Legal, and National Record Retrieval, with NRR viewed as the preferred vendor due to superior technology, customer service, and flexibility. NRR absorbed offshore FTEs as part of contract negotiation, saving Morgan &#x26; Morgan ~$1M. Regional vendors (e.g., YoCierge in Florida) remain for relationship reasons but must comply with matrix pricing. Legacy HIMCs (Ciox/Datavant, MRO, ChartSwap) are viewed as costly, slow, and investor-focused.

## Challenges &#x26; Constraints
Provider-level fees remain uncontrollable and vary by state and facility. Contracts between providers and HIMCs are often exclusive, preventing direct EMR access by third-party vendors. Data errors from client intake (e.g., wrong facility address) cause delays; updated contracts include no-charge correction clauses. Intake accuracy and data completeness remain bottlenecks despite automation progress.

## Financial &#x26; Strategic Impact
The procurement overhaul reduced per-record costs by ~40% while doubling throughput efficiency. Estimated savings exceed $17M annually. The new system improved P&#x26;L visibility, accelerated case prep, and enhanced client satisfaction. Operational velocity directly translates to higher case turnover and revenue realization in Morgan &#x26; Morgan’s contingency-fee model.

## Market &#x26; Competitive Insights
The expert noted that HIMCs like Ciox/Datavant control ~50% of the market but face disruption risk. Third-party vendors offering digital intake and better service can gain share if they maintain compliance and reliability. He views the space as commoditizing, where tech differentiation (API automation, AI-assisted intake) is key to survival. The expert emphasized that vendors should avoid 'hogging' margins—those providing fair, transparent pricing and speed will win share.

## Summary Takeaways
Morgan &#x26; Morgan’s transformation illustrates how operational discipline and technology adoption can modernize an antiquated workflow. By consolidating vendors, enforcing transparent pricing, and prioritizing digital intake, the firm achieved faster turnarounds, major cost savings, and tighter financial control. The ecosystem remains constrained by HIMC.
