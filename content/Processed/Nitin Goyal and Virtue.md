### Market Opportunity & Vision

- Employer marketplace concept to negotiate directly with pharma for drug pricing
- Could enable employers with 100,000+ lives to negotiate directly with pharma companies
- Potential to group multiple employers together for increased negotiating power

### Current Problems with Branded Drugs

- System breaks down particularly with GLP-1s and biologics
- Prior authorization and eligibility issues are just the beginning
- Multiple failure points after patients get the drug:
	- Inability to get refills
	- Cost barriers
	- Side effects
	- Providers often unaware of discontinuation for 6+ months
- Pharma companies spending significant money on ineffective solutions:
	- Hub models
	- Legacy rolodex calls
	- Robo-calls

### Axon Solution Overview

- Infrastructure platform to manage the entire therapy journey
- Prescriptions route through Axon entity (whether dispensed through it or not)
- Manages:
	- Coverage verification
	- Patient onboarding
	- Education
	- Refill tracking
	- Side effect monitoring
	- Outcomes measurement

### Vertical-Specific Approach

- Aligns with pharma’s brand/physiology-specific organization:
	- Weight management section
	- Cardiac section
	- Gastrointestinal section
- Branded verticals with shared infrastructure (similar to Shopify model)
- Example verticals:
	- WaitRx
	- SkinRx
	- GutRx
	- OncologyRx

### Go-to-Market Strategy (SkinRx Example)

- Initial focus on targeting providers currently prescribing drugs like Skyrizi
- Leverage existing pharma sales infrastructure
- Simple provider value proposition: “Send to SkinRx, we manage everything”
- Deliberately avoiding complex EHR integrations initially
- Target initial pilot with 50 dermatologists in one region
- Goal: Demonstrate 10-20% improvement in adherence
