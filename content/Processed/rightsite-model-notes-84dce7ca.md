# RightSite Health Projection Model Notes

July 29, 2024

RIGHT SI+E For non-emergency patients

1.  The model is an 18-month projection (Dec-25) built from the "bottom-up"
2.  Blue text are inputs; black text are calculations
3.  No new markets; reasonable organic growth in existing markets with existing agencies

The first five tabs are output

*   **Key Indicators (Q) & (M)**: select important company indicators such as volume, rates and revenue
*   **Annual / Months**: summary P&Ls
*   **CF**: simplified cash flow statement
*   **AR**: estimate of A/R
    *   Column F = net revenue from P&L
    *   Collections
        *   Backlog estimate at Jun-24
        *   Go forward based on net revenue build + timing assumptions, net of estimated patient responsibility

## SECTION: Markets

*   **Tab: Rates_Vol**. Fee-for-Service rates for each community, derived from fee schedules and RightSite experience + per day activation volume estimates by type, by market
*   **Tab: Atlanta / Jacksonville / San Antonio**. Individual communities, built by EMS call volume assumptions and blended payor FFS and case rates
    *   Note: built in weekends (7 days / week from 5 days / week) in the communities upon achieving positive contribution margin in the 2 months preceding. The extension in operating hours, when it occurs, includes 8 incremental days per month w/ the equivalent number of EMS inbound activations and associated assumptions as the existing week day hours
*   **Tab: Corp Pat Care**. Summary of communities for EMS call volume / revenue + associated expenses including EMS account management from the communities

## SECTION: EXPENSES

*   **Tab: Patient Care Inputs**. Various inputs for the patient care expenses on the Corp Pat Care tab
*   **Tab: S,G&A**. Overhead including people, marketing, IT, consulting + professional services, insurance, rent, other
*   **Tab: FTEs**. Build up of S,G&A headcount and related expenses

## OTHER

*   Note the model adds some FTEs in the 2H24. They are comprised of conversion of long-term consultants to FTEs + incremental payor sales and account management capacity

There are upside opportunities not included in the model

*   **FL** - While we still believe FL will gain traction, this model keeps EMS call volume in FL flat
*   **TX** - There are significant growth opportunities in the TX market, but this model moderates TX EMS call volume growth
*   **RightSite Foundation** - zero contribution to offset uninsured care
*   **GA Medicaid RFP** – RightSite is written into all plans that competed for the GA Medicaid RFP. That translates into about 10% of straight Medicaid (no case rates) will end up in managed Medicaid where we should then get a case rate payment. This should happen in 2025 but in this model we discount any of that benefit.
*   **New GA EMS agencies**, currently in our pipeline, but not yet reflected in volume projections
