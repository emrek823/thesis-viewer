### Meeting Overview

- Alex (CPO) and Amy (COO) from Amae Health discussed specialty pharmacy opportunity
	- Both joined Amae ~16 months ago
	- Company has grown from 15 to ~100 employees in a year
	- Currently operating 5 clinics
	- Developed working care and economic models with paths to growth
	- Now focusing on diversifying beyond core services

### Long-Acting Injectable (LAI) Opportunity

- Patient medication profile
	- 90% of Amae patients take psychiatric medications
	- Goal to transition appropriate patients from oral meds to LAIs
	- 60-70% of patients eventually transition to LAIs if they stay in care
	- Limited formulary (~10 SKUs) with most common being:
		- Abilify
		- Invega
- Current LAI process
	- Order scripts through pharmacies
	- Sometimes use drug rep samples
	- Medication delivered via courier or patient brings it in
	- Psychiatrists administer injections themselves
	- Volume insufficient to justify dedicated staff
- Payer mix varies by geography
	- California: 100% commercial
	- North Carolina: 75% Medicaid, 25% commercial
	- New York: 75% Medicaid, 25% commercial
	- Expected to stabilize at ~50/50 mix outside California

### Key Questions & Considerations

- Business model options
	- Buy and bill model appears most advantageous
	- Requires appropriate wholesale pricing to be viable
	- Unclear if volume thresholds needed for favorable pricing
	- Minimal prior authorization requirements due to patient acuity
	- Current patients typically have hospitalization histories
- 340B program potential
	- Understanding qualifications and nuances is challenging
	- Uncertain if Amae could become a covered entity directly
	- Partnership with existing 340B entities (health systems) could be option
	- Recent regulatory changes may impact opportunities

### Next Steps

- Emre to follow up by Wednesday with:
	- Introductions to key contacts in three areas:
		- Market access intermediaries
		- 340B specialists
		- Wholesaler/GPO representatives
	- Summary of research findings and recommendations
- Alex and Amy to keep communication open about prioritization decisions
