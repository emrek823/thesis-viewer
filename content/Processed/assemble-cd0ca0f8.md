## Slide 1: assemble - Healthcare's frontline leader AI copilot

assemble
Healthcare's frontline leader AI copilot
AI-powered system of work for nurse managers

## Slide 2: Frontline leadership is healthcare's blind spot

assemble
Frontline leadership is healthcare's blind spot

Assemble's insight:
The frontline is where care, cost, and culture converge.
Yet frontline leaders operate without
visibility or support.

## Slide 3: Frontline leaders are buried in admin work instead of driving business outcomes

assemble
Frontline leaders are buried in admin work instead of driving business outcomes

**Average Nurse Manager**
*   **Accesses**
    12+ platforms
    to do their work
*   **Spends over**
    50% of their time
    on admin work
*   **Manages**
    > 60 nurses

They should be focused on:
*   Quality care
*   Staff engagement

## Slide 4: Today's solutions exacerbate the problem with duplicative work in siloed systems

assemble
Today's solutions exacerbate the problem
with duplicative work in siloed systems

Health systems throw point
solutions and people at the
problem
**~$15B**
annually for nurse-
specific administrative
point solutions &
consulting services

This comes at the
expense of:
*   Health system margin
*   Admin burden
*   Operational visibility

## Slide 5: Healthcare's frontline leaders need a System of Work

assemble
Healthcare's frontline leaders need a System of Work

*   Nurse leaders don't have support infrastructure
    They're managing $7M+ PNL with no system of support.
*   Health systems under financial pressure
    Efficiency isn't a "nice to have" — it's survival.
*   $15B+ spent on admin point solutions
    But systems still rely on email and spreadsheets.

Like Salesforce for sales
or Workday for HR,
Assemble organizes and
activates the engine of care
delivery - frontline leaders

Assemble is not a workflow tool —
it's the enablement platform frontline managers desperately need.

## Slide 6: Assemble focuses leaders on the highest impact work

assemble
Assemble focuses leaders on the highest impact work
Assemble is the manager enablement layer that guides and prioritizes the work of a frontline leader.
