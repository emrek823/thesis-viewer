## Slide 5: Why is covering regenerative medicine difficult for payers?

Why is covering regenerative medicine difficult for payers?

#### HIGH BUDGETING RISK
High-cost one-time cures are not more expensive for
payers, but they introduce outsized budgeting risk

**Chart: Yearly Medical Spending (millions) and Zolgensma Cost**
*   **X-axis:** Yearly Medical Spending (millions)
*   **Y-axis:** Budget (implicit)

| Spending Range (Millions) | Description                 |
| :------------------------ | :-------------------------- |
| $0.0 - $8.0               | Yearly Medical Spending     |
| $6.0 - ~$8.0              | Zolgensma costs 30-40% of the total yearly budget |

#### EXTREMELY HIGH COST TO REINSURE
Existing reinsurance options on the market are unfavorable,
leaving payers to cover GCT therapies at large losses

*   **15%** Insurer Margin **VS.** **200-500%** Reinsurer Margin
*   **$2.1M** Zolgensma's Listing Price **VS.** **$14M+** Coverage Cost per Expected Zolgensma Treatment (Cigna Embarc)
