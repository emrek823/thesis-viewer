## Slide 2: The Problem

![RightSite Logo](rightsite_logo.png)
RIGHT
SI+E

+ THE PROBLEM

130 million
people visit the
ER each year.¹

Over 50% of these
visits are not
emergencies and
are avoidable.²

H
$3,400 is the average cost of an
avoidable ER visit ² — 8x higher than
urgent care or PCPs.

EMS is reimbursed only when
transporting patients to an ER, whether
or not they have an emergency. EMS
also averages long response times for
true emergencies because of staffing
shortages and hours-long hospital
unloading times for low-acuity patients.

!
Patients receiving non-emergency
care from ERs experience long wait
times, surprise bills, and unnecessary
services.

## Slide 3: The RightSite Outcome

+ THE RIGHTSITE OUTCOME

Our tech-enabled service navigates
non-emergency patients to
in-network providers — generating
better clinical outcomes and patient
experience at a lower cost.

*   😊 Plan Members have a better
    experience and improved outcomes at
    a lower out-of-pocket cost and avoid
    surprise ER and ambulance bills.
*   🏥 EMS provides better patient care,
    experience and outcomes while
    increasing runs per shift, availability for
    true emergencies, and revenue.
*   💰 Communities have greater health
    equity with better access to
    appropriate care at the right time.
*   👨‍⚕️ Community Providers treat more
    patients otherwise headed to an
    avoidable ER visit.
*   💲 Payors have less leakage and better
    member experiences while saving an
    average of $3,000 per ER trip.
*   H Hospitals reduce overcrowding and
    create more ER availability for true
    emergencies.

## Slide 4: The Market

SI+E

+ THE MARKET

66,000,000
avoidable
ER visits.

### ALL ER VISITS³

| Category               | Percentage | Breakdown of Avoidable ER Visits | Percentage |
| :--------------------- | :--------- | :------------------------------- | :--------- |
| Avoidable ER Visits    | 51%        | Avoidable discharge from ER      | 71%        |
| Needed ER Visits       | 49%        | Avoidable in-patient admission   | 20%        |
|                        |            | Avoidable observation stay       | 9%         |

Much of this ER volume is driven by
non-emergency conditions such as:
*   epidemic levels of social
    determinants of health
*   chronic disease
*   the increasing difficulty accessing
    primary care
*   society conditioned to
    "call 911 if this is an emergency"

## Slide 5: The Opportunity

SI+E

+ THE OPPORTUNITY

That's 66 million
avoidable ER visits
with an average
savings of $3,000.

The total
opportunity is
$198 billion.

### Cost and Savings Comparison

| Metric                                | Value       |
| :------------------------------------ | :---------- |
| Average cost for avoidable ER visit⁴  | $3,400      |
| Average cost for non-ER care (RightSite solution)⁵ | $400        |
| Average savings                       | $3,000      |

[4] Based on non-emergency ER visits weighted average cost of discharge, observation stay and inpatient dispositions using 2019 Medicare data.
[5] $400 = $150 ER MD telehealth + $50 round trip transportation + $200 RightSite admin fee. RightSite gainshare fees not included.

SI+E

+ OUR SERVICES

The RightSite
Connect™
Platform
serves any
ER-bound
non-emergency
patient.

### EMS-INITIATED SERVICE
Upon arriving at a 911 call, EMS partners with RightSite by activating the RightSite Connect platform on their smartphone or any internet-enabled device. EMS and their patient then connect by video to an ER physician and a RightSite Navigator to confirm the non-emergency condition. The Navigator schedules an appropriate in-network non-emergency provider at a clinic or in the patient's home (virtual or in-person), and arranges on-demand round trip transportation if necessary. RightSite follows up with patients 24 hours later, often uncovering and solving additional needs that help these patients avoid a future trip to the ER.

### PROACTIVE OUTREACH SERVICE
Many ER patients use the ER for non-emergency medical and social needs. For these patients, RightSite's Navigators, trained in empathic communication, offer them personalized navigation to appropriate in-network local clinical and social need resources.
