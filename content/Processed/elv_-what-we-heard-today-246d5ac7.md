## Elevance Health, Inc. (ELV)
### ELV: What We Heard Today

Elevance presented at a conference today and provided several updates, including details into current cost trends (i.e. Medicaid), non-recurring EPS items baked into 2025 guidance, and the intention to exit the standalone PDP business in 2026. In response to the commentary, we are updating our model to better reflect these items (more on this below). Notably, our full-year 2025 EPS estimate of $30.00 is unchanged but we are lowering our full-year 2026 EPS estimate to $30.50 representing growth of just 2%, but closer to 13% growth off run rate 2025 EPS (closer to $27 per share). We also provide a brief recap of some of the commentary that we found most notable:

1) To start, Elevance reiterated 2025 guidance (EPS and MLR) despite citing a softer Medicaid outlook than what was communicated in July. Consistent with prior commentary, the elevated Medicaid cost trend is driven ~1/3 by higher acuity of the population and ~2/3 by increased utilization and coding intensity. This includes higher usage in LTSS, behavioral health, and pharmacy. Operating margin performance will likely be softer than the outlook provided in July, as the company no longer expects sequential improvement in the back half of the year for Medicaid. Looking forward, the company mentioned that the range of potential 2026 outcomes for Medicaid is broader than it has been in the past. Elevance expects rates will continue to be misaligned from current cost trends in the near-term and noted the potential for early implementation of the budget reconciliation bill in some states in 2026. Offsetting softer Medicaid trends, cost trend in Individual ACA is developing favorably in 3Q, though costs continue to be elevated off historical levels. The primary causes of higher cost trend continue to be higher acuity from the shifting risk pool, increased utilization, and more aggressive provider coding tactics. The company is addressing higher costs in Individual ACA through disciplined pricing in 2026 and looks to return to a more normalized margin profile next year. Importantly, 3Q trends in Medicare and the Commercial Group business are both in line with prior expectations.

2) Elevance noted that there is approximately $3 per share of non-recurring favorable items currently included in 2025 EPS guidance. As a reminder, current 2025 EPS guidance is $30 per share for 2025. Based on today's commentary, it appears that the runrate EPS outlook for 2025 is closer to $27 per share. Elevance attributed the one-time favorable benefit primarily to tax, and VBC settlements that were mentioned last quarter, and favorability in net investment income that was not explicitly called out last quarter.

Based on this commentary we are updating our EPS estimates for 2026 but reiterating our full-year 2025 estimate of $30.00 per share. Our estimates now suggest that full year 2026 EPS will be $30.50, down from $32.00 previously. Our updated estimate calls for approximately 13% growth over the runrate 2025 EPS of approximately $27.00 per share.

CONTINUED...

Our price target of $336 is based on 11.0x our 2026 EPS of $30.50.

3) The company plans to exit their standalone Medicare Part D business in 2026 as well as certain MA markets/products. CFO Mark Kaye stated that this decision does not reflect underperformance but rather represents actions to focus the company's resources on where they can deliver the greatest impact. This is not terribly surprising in light of the modest contribution to overall results. Looking at our estimates, Elevance's standalone PDP revenue for 2026 is expected to be roughly $755 million (only ~0.4% of revenues) with a total membership of 220k lives. Assuming a 3% margin, this decision only amounts to a ~$23 million impact on earnings in 2026, or approximately $0.10 per share. As part of Elevance's review of their markets, the company will also exit some other plans and counties facing economic pressures in 2026. This decision will affect approximately another 150k MA members (not official guidance) across both individual and group businesses in 2026.
