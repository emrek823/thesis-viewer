### Rubicon Founders Integration Challenges

- Namesh (Head of AI & Tech at Rubicon Founders) dealing with EMR integration costs
	- Rhapsody maintenance: massive cost overruns vs expectations
	- ECW, Next Gen also expensive for their portfolio companies
	- PE roll-up model creates multiple clinic sync needs
- Integration platforms like Redox charge per connection
	- Theoretically scalable but not cost-effective for buyers
	- Similar pricing issues across traditional integration engines
- Integration engine reality check from Eric:
	- Historically doesn’t need to exist if you’re a software engineer
	- Still writing code with semantic wrappers for lower-code approach
	- Messy middle between full code and true no-code solutions

### Eric’s Current Projects & Strategy

- Building React.js for data mappings (academic proof of concept)
	- 60-70% complete, designed for social proof not revenue
- Integration engine from ground up
	- Previously showed “reskinned Rhapsody” version
	- Now rethinking primitives and technical approach
- December/January launch timeline for both projects
- Considering EMR from scratch (AI native approach)
	- Acknowledges others doing similar (Max Low mentioned)
	- Distribution challenges remain significant barrier
- Data consulting wedge strategy
	- Friend at Qualified spent months on analyst work post-deal
	- Would pay $500K annually to speed up 10x
	- Build trust through consulting, then embed systems
	- Longer time horizon play vs venture-scalable approach

### Next Steps

- Eric to send 2-3 sentence intro blurb for Namesh connection
- Emre will introduce Eric to Namesh at Rubicon Founders
- Eric continuing build-in-public approach for social proof
