## Slide 3: Key KPIs and Company Stage
Healthcare services companies have two broad phases, with differing proof points within each.

### Phases of Healthcare Services Companies

**o to 1 Phase**
1.  **Product Market Fit**: State of widespread demand for service that satisfies a critical need(1)
2.  **Channel Market Fit**: Repeatable, profitable channels of distribution(2)
3.  **Operational Economic Fit**: Repeatable approach to scaling operational growth levers and generating robust economics
4.  **Quality of Services Fit**: Repeatable approach to delivering high quality services

**1 to X Phase**
1.  **Return on Invested Capital**: Repeatable, robust returns from reinvestment
2.  **Benefits from Scale**: Incremental improvements in operations and economics from scale

**Goal**: Iterate on strategy and / or operations until all four fits are achieved
**Goal**: Scale the successful model with continued investment

## Slide 4: Key KPIs and Company Stage
We have strong product market fit, channel market fit, operational market fit, and quality of services fit – some operational levers to pull.

### ANNA o to 1 Trajectory

*   **Product Market Fit**: Extensive waiting list for services, with continued robust referral volume. KPI: 4 qualified referrals per month | Target: 4 qualified referrals per month
*   **Channel Market Fit**: Inbound volume from pediatricians, early intervention agencies, and internal diagnostics – all low-cost and recurring. Internal diagnostic remains margin neutral until we insource.
*   **Operational Economic Fit**:
    *   **Recruiting**: Good recruiting funnel, but recruiting is not keeping pace with referrals. KPI: 2 hires per month | Target: 4 hires per month
    *   **BCBA Utilization**: BCBA billing is not optimized KPI: 15 hours per week (-9% Gross Margin) | Target: 25 hours per week (34.6% Gross Margin)
    *   **Client Attendance Rate**: Strong attendance rate KPI: 90.3% | Target: 90%
    *   **RBT Utilization**: Healthy 61.8% RBT utilization but not optimized KPI: 61.8% Utilization (51.5% Gross Margin) | Target: 75% Utilization (60% Gross Margin)
    *   **Collections**: Collections from commercial payors remains strong (90%+, being reconciled by billing team), Carelon collections rate since in-network strong but previous single case agreement collections prior to in-network status remains low
*   **Quality of Services Fit**: Remarkable qualitative feedback from families regarding the quality of services → only increased demand for hours with no voluntary departures of families; however, quantitative evidence is required

*   Hitting our target unit-level metrics makes ANNA cash flow positive at the corporate level; however, proving out unit-level trajectory will likely encourage greater investment in the "1 to x" phase
*   ANNA's ~$8.5 million in cash has set the business up in a very strong financial position

## Slide 13: Strategic Considerations
### Indiana Expansion

*   We got the Physicians Health Plan fee schedule back, and the BCBA hourly reimbursement rate is $120 (similar to MA) and RBT hourly reimbursement rate is $93.32 (vs. $65 in MA)
*   This is expected to be a remarkable 78% gross margin, which is accelerating the interest in expanding into the state
*   We are currently contracting and credentialing for the payors in the state, with expectations of completion by Q2 of 2025
*   Expansion creates operational complexity and can be approached in one of two ways:
    *   We hire a founder / entrepreneurial profile to open up the market and serve as the market opener (perhaps with vertical mobility to owning the P&L)
    *   I hire a P&L owner to manage MA and directly relocate & open Indiana—have strong connections with systems in the area
*   Progress on MA expansion and system building will likely determine how much capacity and redundancy we have for me to make the move

## Slide 14: Strategic Considerations
### Other Strategic Considerations

*   **MSO**
    *   **Pilot**: Piloting the MSO in Washington with an individual provider – starting with home-based care
    *   **Market Launch**: MSO serves as an effective way to open markets capital efficiently and test the waters before unit level expansion
    *   **Revenue Cycle Management**: MSO economics are highly reliant on collections rates, as even 20% take rate requires 80% collections to break-even
    *   **Strategic Hires**: Can hire executives out of proven MSO businesses to run MSO model separately—limitation is contracting, credentialing
*   **Ancillary Services**
    *   **Diagnostics**: We are insourcing diagnostics to drive margin, volume, and brand
    *   **SLP, OT**: We’re actively developing programming and contracting to begin to offer services
    *   **Social Skills**: We are looking to launch social skills to further drive economics
*   **Value-Based Care**
    *   Exploring VBP programs with Massachusetts payors
*   **Venture Debt**
    *   We can likely raise $2 – 3mm in venture debt with $50K placement fee, 8% interest rate, 20 – 50bps warrants (negotiable).

## Slide 17: Strategic Considerations
### MSO Manifesto

*   FFS tech-enabled MSOs have been of negative value to payors - driving up utilization (asset-light roll up)
*   Payors are increasingly responding on the RCM side of the business requiring authorizations, denying claims, etc. (MSOs are a levered business)
*   Access matters, but quality matters more
*   Next generation of MSOs care have rigorous clinical protocols and quality monitoring
*   They must bring costs down via less utilization
*   ANNA’s MSO is focused on protocolizing and productizing clinical services for independent providers to deliver “ANNA” care—this is a less intensive, parent-focused intervention model
*   Ultimately, ANNA intends to replace ABA with NDBI in both the payors’ and families’ mindshare—driving value to clinicians via clinical protocols, distribution, and potentially contracting

## Slide 18: Strategic Considerations
### Key Risks

*   **Clinical staffing**: In order to keep pace with demand, we need to increase our funnel of qualified RBTs and BCBAs. We have recently hired a human resources director who is already hitting our 4 RBT hires per month KPI
*   **Real estate operations**: Process of surveying, touring, architecture builds, lease negotiations, permitting, and construction leading to 6-month lead time to new unit builds.
*   **Carelon revenue cycle management**: It took 11 months to get contracted with Carelon, which meant the bulk of our billing was done through single case agreements. Carelon Behavioral Health is in a state of disarray, so reimbursements on our SCAs remains outstanding. Billing in-network has been fixed.
