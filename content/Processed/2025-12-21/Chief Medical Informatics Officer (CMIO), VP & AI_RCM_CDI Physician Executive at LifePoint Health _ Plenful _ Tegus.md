### Client
Hi, I appreciate you making the time to speak. I am looking into this broader prior auth space. It feels like a pretty exciting use of AI. There are a lot of interesting companies going at it and so excited to talk to folks like yourself who have evaluated some of these solutions and can talk to the various puts and takes on them. Launching right in, it would be super helpful to understand a little bit more about Lifepoint. Obviously, I see online, but any more details on your organization, your role there just to set context.

### Expert
Here's a quick debrief. I'm a physician by trade, have been for 15 years. I've taken for the past eight and a half years a foundation of clinical background, oversee all the clinical IT, all of our AI, all of our innovation for a large for-profit healthcare system. Do business in 35 out of 50 states, 60+ acute care hospitals, hundreds of medical office buildings that surround the acute with all specialties included. We also have 105 post-acute care facilities, I think rehab, long-term care, behavioral health, standalone psychiatric hospitals.

Annual revenue, **$12 billion**. We've got a very complicated technology stack and yet face all of the how fast can we get with AI across all of our different service lines. One of the unique things is I oversee all of our pharmacy from a technology and operational perspective as well. A lot of these products are really making some inroads in the pharmacy space. There's a lot of AI as a code word. If you dig a little deeper, you'll find out that it's not as robust or it's still as evolving even if it is really enticing in your wave of the future.

Got it. You're looking at these things, you're at the forefront, what was the specific impetus to, as your role overseeing pharmacy operations, go out and look for a new prior auth solution?

### Expert
It's multifold here because a lot of these products are basically just shifting the burden of you as your own healthcare system not wanting to facilitate what's happened with prior auth, so vendors like the Tandems of the world and these other vendors called Capsule and Phil that do the same thing.

All you're really doing is you're following the same ordering process, you're identifying the, basically, let's call them, third parties who are then going to facilitate on the patient behalf to find the best price potentially aligned with shipping and/or make sure that there is any rebates or anything possible for the patient. They're going to basically do the legwork for you as a healthcare system.

There's another flavor of this subset here when you get into specialty medications, when you get into meds that you are actually going to provide within a clinic setting. Vendors that are a little bit different in this space, vendors like Latent, Mandolin, and Plenful are vendors that help you as an organization get through some of the more difficulties with more costly medications. There are two lines of thinking here. One is you're just going to outsource to a third party, the other is you're going to actually partner with one of these programs to initiate more AI-driven prior authorizations.

### Client
Got it. How did you think about those different paths and what was right for you guys?

### Expert
You have to have a flavor of both, quite honestly, because you have enough patients that are going to really...

want to benefit from these really patient-friendly vendors who basically work on the patient's behalf. It doesn't happen unless they are either aware of the vendor or we, as a healthcare system, have built that vendor into our ordering process to ensure that they can receive the orderable, they can fill that request per the patient protocol or best price or is it going to be delivered however the patient prefers.

We've still got to work with that vendor to create the ability for them to receive those orders. A lot of the time, your EHRs now come with a lot of these pre-built. I support 12 different EHRs. If I was to go into six of them right now, I'd be able to send an order to Tandem on a patient's behalf to be able to facilitate the execution of the order. It feels as though it's a little bit of a patient preference of where they want meds to go. A lot of the time patients are saying, "I want to use this vendor for this," or they're being told by their pharmacy benefit manager, "This is the tool you have to use." That's how that line of thinking actually works today.

The others, when it comes to if we're doing big infusions, we're doing high-level medications that are being dispensed in a clinical setting, we ourselves are going to the market. We need a vendor to help us with a lot of the pharmacy AI. It's really difficult. A lot of these things take a lot of paperwork. If we can leverage some AI to support, we're going to give this medication six times over the next six weeks and we need to get approval for all of them.

That's where these other vendors that are getting into pharmacy RCM are really trying to make a name for themselves today. It's easier in pharmacy than it is on AI for you to get a clearance to do a diagnostic study. It's two different lines of thinking. You have a different source on the other end, where the AI is a little bit more readily available on the pharmacy side of things than on the medical side of things.

**Client**
That's super helpful. As I understood it, if you look at Latent, they are having a fair amount of success with academic medical centers, their specialty pharma. Mandolin seemed like it was having success in standalone infusion centers. Tandem seems to be more like physician groups, especially in dermatology, that sort of thing. Is that how you were seeing it? Maybe get into more specifics around each of those products, how you looked at them, and where you ultimately decided to go.

It's hard to say no to what Tandem does because it's just a facilitator in this. We've got to partner with them for some type of execution. As long as we can connect the dots, as long as we have it as an offering built into our workflows, really, they're working on the patient's behalf.

That's the core of those types of products. That's why many of them exist today, where instead of me sending you to a retail pharmacy for you to then go figure out if the med is going to be available and what you're going to pay, I'm looking at a third party to leverage and decide all of that for you and work on your behalf. It's just a different approach and it's almost like a concierge type of a tool for you to support and get your meds. It isn't a big undertaking to partner up with those type of tools. These are very patient-centric and patient-friendly.

The others are much more complicated. Certain healthcare systems are going to really benefit based upon their level of services. Some that participate in 340B programs are absolutely going to need the Latent, the Plenful, and the Mandolins of the world based upon care settings and subset of patients. It's very different. One's very heavy with technology, the Latents and the Mandolins of the world. The others are more interfaces or connections with EHRs to support the ordering of a typical med that you'd get five years ago at a retail pharmacy, now you get it potentially mailed to you.

----

**Client**
Got it. It sounds like you adopted Tandem. What does that actually look like? Maybe just more specifically take me through the workflow. A patient gets some infusion drug from your pharmacy and then they get a link to Tandem. This is probably naive, but more specifically, how does that process work and where do you actually roll out Tandem to?

# Expert Discussion on Patient Autonomy and Pharmacy Integration

## Expert
Sure. This is a lot of patient autonomy in this situation. A patient is going to come in and oftentimes the big question is, "What's your preferred pharmacy?" Oftentimes, they're going to say the Walmart two hours down the road. Oftentimes, the pharmacy benefits that they are aware of, that they receive all the information on year-over-year when they're picking a plan, is going to potentially align them with one of these options that exist. Tandem is one option, Capsule is another one. There's another one called Blink.

There's a lot of these third-party groups that basically the patient is going to tell us as the healthcare system, "I use Tandem for my meds." That provider is going to follow through what they've always done when they're placing meds, only they're going to route that medication orderable to Tandem to receive that. Again, our EHRs are the bellwether here to be able to help build out that these are access points that we can send meds to.

The EHRs are critical in this because we need that interface that the EHR has with Tandem in order for these orders to route to them for them to be able to work on the patient's behalf. We can tell our providers, "Hey, here are all the third-party mail delivery vendors that we work with." It's usually only after the EHRs have built them into the system as a receiver of meds that are being ordered.

## Client
Okay. In order for then you to roll it out, as you said, it's like you want to have this option. That's good for patients. Do you go to the EHRs and say, "Hey, turn on this integration?" Do they say, "Oh, hey, we already have this?" Do you have to basically do any advertising or education to your physicians? What does it actually take then to get that offline?

## Expert
Oftentimes, with the subset of patients or the markets that we're in, as these types of players come into play, we'll ask our vendors, "Hey. Do you have an interface to Tandem?" as an example. The answer is yes, "Okay, we need to turn it on within our EHR environment so that can become an orderable that we can send medications out to," then it becomes our providers who know what they're ordering meds.

----

### Sean Doolan
This is at the very end of the step of what has to happen when they are deciding that "I've decided what med, I've decided what dose I'm going to give you. Where are you routing this med to go?" Everything is e-prescriptions now, instead of sending it to the retail pharmacy, I'm going to identify Tandem as the receiver of the orderable. It could be one med, it could be five, they're all going to go to Tandem. I am going to send it to them, they are going to receive the orderable, and then engage the patient.

They're going to either text the patient, they're going to reach out to the patient, say, "Here's where we are in the process. We found out your benefits cover this, we found a rebate that's going to cover this. We're going to mail them to you, and we're going to help facilitate you having a mail delivery for all of your meds."

That's really it. It doesn't take a ton of training on the provider side, other than understanding that if you order from Tandem, you order from Capsule or Phil, it's the same behavior of what you have to do. There is not a lot of big learning curve here. It's the patient educating the provider to say, "I use this vendor for my meds," and that exchange of information occurring so that they can do it in the EHR, so that can happen for the patient.

## Client
Will the provider ever say to them, "Hey, you can use one of these services and refer that way," or does it always tend to come from the patient preference?

## Expert
In a perfect world, I'm 100% with you. I think what happens here though, is oftentimes when we're getting preferred pharmacies, it's happening upstream. It's the clinical staff member who, before the provider rolls in, is asking them some of the specifics. "Where would you like your meds that are either going to be renewed today or potentially you're going to get some? What's your preferred pharmacy?"

## Transcript

**Client:**
Got it. Do you view Tandem as disruptive, doing something different? You didn't mention CoverMyMeds, but we understand that they're in this space too, or do you view them as just similar to all those other providers? How do you look at them being, different, better, or not?

**Expert:**
I say that most of these vendors are equivalent in this space. Now, Tandem probably is the one that's most known and available into all the different EHRs to be able to access. Capsule is another one that's commonly available. The Phil and the Blinks of the world are probably a little bit less known and we're probably going to require a little bit more working with EHRs to open up that access.

Are they ahead of others in this space? Sure. Is their delivery so unique? I wouldn't say that. Tandem does not have a pharmacy attached to it. They are basically doing the bidding, trying to find the best possible pricing in the meds, and then sending that on for somebody to fill the meds. Others, like Capsule, actually has a pharmacy attached to it. What they could probably do is get meds to you faster because they're eliminating that having to hand off the order to somebody else, but that's minute as far as a timeline of what's actually going to take.

I don't see a big difference. I just feel like this is always a space that's going to only continue to grow. Patients want less retail pharmacy, they want best prices. These tools are going to continue to gain popularity that way, but it's really going to be the patients who are going to drive a lot of this and/or the health plans who are going to tell the patient, "This is what we recommend. Get away from maybe Optum doing your meds. Here's another vendor who's going to work on your behalf if you want the best possible pricing model."

**Client:**
Got it. Switching gears then a bit over into the Latent, Plenful. Talk about then where they fit in the workflow, what values you felt there, and what that evaluation process looked like.

**Expert:**
Sure. That's going to fit certain types of clinics versus others, those that are heavy into infusions, those that drive an injectable type of model. You're going to have certain specialties that are going to be big needs for this. We do not participate in 340B, but if we did, that would be an absolute indication that you need one of these vendors to support that. Not only from the ability to find the right pricing, find the right coverage, tracking that inventory management, and then, of course, the data analytics to support some of this that you need to produce a 340B is an absolute standard that you have to have.

We look at it a little differently. We look at it as A) it's going to help some of the real-time pharmacy decisions. It's going to help us with inventory, trying to find potential best pricing out there for some of the injectables, and being able to track with a lot of that data that we need is another big benefit of this.

It really is solving your need to purchase meds as a healthcare system. Have the meds available within your clinical setting so that then you can produce and dispense on the patient's behalf for them to come back around. It's checking that ease of use box, and I think, in theory, the real-time pharmacy benefits, where you're reaching out to, are more equipped with technology to be able to support pharmacy as an AI initiative.

## Conversation Transcript

**Client**
Got it. Specifically, then, you evaluated Latent, Plenful, and Mandolin. Is that right?

**Expert**
Yes.

**Client**
Yeah. It sounds like you ended up going with Plenful. Why was that? What did you see in their various solutions?

**Expert**
I just think when looking at the options here of what you need them for, there's a lot of breadth, there's a lot of solutions, there's a lot of different features that they have. Mandolin feels very resigned to an infusion type of care setting. A lot of ours are happening in clinical settings that have infusion rooms type of thing. Mandolin feels a little bit isolated in what they do. It's compelling. If I was an infusion center, I would absolutely pick them because they've cornered that infusion methodology there, that's a certain type of workflow.

Latent and Plenful are a little bit more robust in a wider distribution of service areas where they can cover. I think at the end of it, it just happened to be a little bit more options with Plenful. I think the overall tech platform and the data analytics was a little bit more robust, but you really can't go wrong picking either. I just think Plenful is a little bit more mature and further along than maybe where Latent is. Maybe that's a little subjective, but that was my vibe.

**Client**
Okay. When did you make this decision? Have you rolled out Plenful? What's the latest on the adoption?
**Sean Doolan**

**Expert**
Sure. We're going through this process now. It's early in that stage, but I think we first identified the opportunity of, "Hey, there's this niche that we got to start solving as we're expanding a little bit more of an infusion utilization within our healthcare system." I think this is that natural next step to roll through this process. It is ongoing from an implementation, but you're really hand-picking the markets that are going to start with this type of tool.

Ultimately thinking, as this becomes more of a standard and more of not just a niche, but a need across a lot of very different types of deliverables with medication, I think you see these tools have scratched the surface of where AI for prior auth is going. Everybody's competing for that AI prior auth in medical land right now.

These tools I think have a lot of opportunity to say, "Hey, we're working well here. How could our AI footprint get a little bit larger?" I do think these types of tools have picked a market today, but I do give them a lot of opportunity to start pushing further into the medical prior authorization side because the platforms are going to be the same. It's those on the receiving end being able to handle a lot of that prior authorization with an AI kind of footprint.

**Client**
Got it. Are you getting value from Plenful yet or are you still in that implementation phase?

**Expert**
We're not in implementation, but these types of things have always been obstacles. You think about the difficulties of patients who are great candidates for these types of injectables. You just get one injectable. Oftentimes, it's a series of four, sometimes six. There is a lot of complexity behind this level of care. There's

also a lot of potential reimbursement, but oftentimes, these are identified as good opportunities. You lag with trying to get a prior authorization and you miss your moment with the patient or you frustrate them or you miss certain documentation that should have accompanied the prior auth and you get denied.

I think you're alleviating a lot of that bottleneck, so I'm expecting a really good ROI because we're going to see better patient compliance, we're going to identify a patient, and actually be able to maybe schedule them before they leave and miss that moment. A lot of these, because they're serial injections, you get a window of how many injections you can give. You're really opening up an aggressive care timeline versus going one injectable to the next injectable, which makes it very difficult to ever see the output of a patient really graduating after six injectables.

**Client**
Got it. Roughly, how much are you going to pay for Plenful?

**Expert**
I think it's going to be on a case base. It's going to be a transactional base. The volume of patients are going to be what drives this, so you're going to leverage a tool and you're going to buy it in more of like a subscription model. If you expect 200 encounters a month where you're going to need this, you're going to pay a fee based upon that subscription model.

Of course, it's tiered. The more you go up, the more that potential is there to bring the per transaction pricing down. Is it a small incremental percentile of what you're chasing or is it just a flat fee? I think some of those models are flexible based upon what type of clinical setting. Is it you always order the same med or is it highly volatile where you want a flat transaction fee, so it's not tied to what the price of the item really is?

**Client**
Got it. Overall, it sounds like you see a lot of opportunity in this space when you talked about the ROI, that sort of thing. What do you hear from the industry? Do people like Latent as well? Do you think both Latent and Plenful can be successful? What's your view on both overall opportunity and specific opportunity for each of those companies?

**Sean Doolan**

**Expert**
Both vendors are very similar. You could tell if Mandolin continues to expand their care setting base, they could be just right there. Another vendor is Thoughtful AI. A lot of vendors have tapped into something successful within the pharmacy RCM space. It's always felt like a murky middle of, how do you handle RCM within pharmacy? It's different than the medical side of RCM.

I think, to me, there's tremendous amount of opportunity. As every dollar is scrutinized and everything really needs to have the authenticity of automation behind it, I think it bodes very well for these vendors to continue to scale like they are. If you've really figured out the pharmacy piece, think about going further into dialysis, think about going further into other types of care settings where a lot of this AI proficiency is going to be needed.

I think they can definitely have a vision to scale up, and yet, while they're doing a lot really well with pharmacy RCM, be very successful. I give them a lot of opportunity in the very near future for this concept to spread and yet continue to be really good in the pharmacy space because there's going to continue to be complexity here.

**Client**
Awesome. This has been super helpful, so I really appreciate you taking the time. Thank you.
