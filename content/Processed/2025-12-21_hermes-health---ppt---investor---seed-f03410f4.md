## Slide 2: The Team & Founder

**The Team & Founder**

**CEO & Founder: Alejandro Zamorano**

I've spent the last six years at the ground floor of building the rails for identified and de-identified health data movement at Datavant.

I know how data moves and I know all the players.

*   Spearhead record retrieval solutions for life sciences at Datavant (2024).
*   Led Datavant's Life Sciences vertical, scaled revenue from inception (2019 to 2024).

## Slide 3: Identified Health Data the Future

**Identified Health Data the Future**

Identified Health Data is 10x More Valuable than De-identified Data.

**Identified Data:** $150 to $300 per patient
*   Enables direct patient-level action
*   Clear provenance
*   Clearly measurable ROI
*   Rich data profile

**De-Identified Data:** $0.01 to $10 per patient
*   Limited to population analysis
*   Unclear provenance
*   Hard to measure outcomes
*   Limited data profile

| Use Case                 | De-Identified                                         | Identified                                                 |
| :----------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Clinical Trials Recruitment** | Protocol design and feasibility                       | Qualify patients directly for a particular study           |
| **Life Insurance**       | Analyze broad health trends and mortality for actuarial models | Underwrite a specific policy for individual                |
| **Health Care Operations** | Process optimization and benchmarking                 | Patient specific billing audit and fraud detection         |
| **Life Sciences**        | Aggregated health and outcomes research               | Find exact source of an adverse event with full clinical context |

## Slide 4: Identified Data – a $12B Untapped Market.

**Identified Data – a $12B Untapped Market.**

Identified Health Data is the Next Major Growth Frontier and it's currently Underserved.

| Market Size                             | Medical Record Requests Per Year |

| Payors - Health                         | 80,000,000                       |
| **TOTAL**                               | **125,500,000**                  |
| **MARKET**                              | **$12,500,000,000**              |

**Concentric Circles Chart Data:**
*   Patient Reported Outcomes: $0.5B
*   De-Identified Data: $1B
*   Linkable De-Identified Patient Data: $2B
*   Identified Patient Data Today: $12B
*   Future Identified Patient Data: $180B

## Slide 5: Why Now?

**Why Now?**

The De-identified and Identified Worlds have Evolved in Isolation — They are now set to Converge.

| De-Identified World                                                                      | Identified World                                                                                     |
| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Built comfort exchanging health data across 1,000+ sources                               | Largely unaware that health data can be traded or licensed                                           |
| Market is mature; data is commoditized                                                   | Still rely on fax and manual workflows                                                               |
| Growth pressure is creating push for new markets and use cases                           | Few know how to license or value health data                                                         |
| Hesitate to power identified workflows due to compliance risks                           | Early APIs from Epic, Athena, Office Ally, Waystar are starting to create data liquidity             |
| Limited knowledge of use cases that require identified health data (this was intentional as cultural norm) | However the market lack technical, operational, and legal knowledge to implement                     |

## Slide 6: Problem: Identified Data is Stuck in the Past

**Problem: Identified Data is Stuck in the Past**

Access to Identified Data is Fragmented, Full of Friction, and Labor Intensive

**The Problem**

HIEs and TEFCA were designed to enable seamless health data exchange but in practice, its made it worse. Access to identified data is still full of friction.

*   **Fragmentation:** 1,000+ data custodians with limited footprint and coverage.
*   **Multiple Connections:** Requestors need multiple data sources to meet their needs.
*   **Friction:** Labor cost of $100 to pull one medical record
*   **Confusion:** Varying channels to get medical records (fax, bespoke requestor portals, and limited APIs).

**Network Diagram Entities:**
*   Patient Registry
*   CRO
*   Health Plan
*   Clinic
*   HIE
*   EHR
*   Claims
*   Hospital
*   ROI
*   Imaging
*   Law Firm
*   Life Insurance
*   EHR (appears twice)

## Slide 7: Solution: One Network. One API. One Workflow.

**Solution: One Network. One API. One Workflow.**

Identified Data needs a Trusted Network that Reduces Friction, Turnaround Times, and Enforces Rules.

| Requestors           | Custodians                |
| :------------------- | :------------------------ |
| Law Firms            | Release of Information    |
| Life Insurance       | Claims Clearinghouses     |
| Health Plans         | EHR Software              |
| CRO's                | Imaging Software          |
| Healthcare Operations | Hospitals                 |
| Patient Registries   | Clinics                   |

**Network Diagram Entities (with Hermes Health at center):**
*   Patient Registry
*   CRO
*   Health Plan
*   Clinic
*   HIE
*   EHR
*   Claims
*   Hospital
*   ROI
*   Imaging
*   Law Firm
*   Life Insurance
*   EHR (appears twice)
*   HERMES HEALTH (at the center, connecting all)

## Slide 8: Network Effect & Value

**Network Effect & Value**

Hermes Provides Value to Both the Requestor and the Custodian – Creating a Reinforcing Flywheel effect.

| Requestor                     | Custodian                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| :---------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Faster Turnaround: More Revenue** Data comes back in minutes instead of weeks | **More Demand: More Revenue** Hermes reduces the friction to request and deliver data; inducing demand for the Custodian's data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **More Data: More Revenue** More data enables Requestors to unlock new markets and use cases.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | **Implementation Burden: Less Cost** Hermes handles integrations with Requestors so Custodians don't have to manage one-off tech implementations and maintenance. |
| **Less Overhead: Less Cost** One API to submit and retrieve identified health data no more bespoke connections, integrations, and maintenance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | **Scalable Intake: Less Cost** Requests arrives in a single, standardized format. Unlocking lower operational cost, faster routing, and simplified scaling.      |

**Flywheel Effect:**
1.  Faster and Easier Records
2.  More Record Volume
3.  More Requestors
4.  More Vendors Integrate to Capture Volume

## Slide 10: Access & Delivery Layer

**Access & Delivery Layer**

Our Access and Delivery Layer Connects Requestor to Custodians

**Access and Delivery Layer**

*   **Intake:** Requestors securely submit patient's full name, date of birth, and a signed HIPAA Authorization form.
*   **Smart Routing:** The Unity Platform then routes these requests to our network of Custodians.
*   **Partner Fulfillment:** Custodians processes these Requests and transmit data back to Hermes
*   **Delivery:** Hermes delivers the data back to Requestors without revealing Custodian specific infrastructure—protecting privacy, and confidentiality
*   **Transparent Pricing:** Custodian is paid on a per-record/patient fee.

**Workflow Diagram:**
1.  Requestor
2.  Secure Intake -> Hermes Platform (Pre and Post Processing)

## Slide 15: The Business Model

**The Business Model**

We have a Simple Pricing that Scales as our Network Grows.

**Business Model**

*   Hermes monetizes the Requestors.
*   Hermes pays the Custodian on a per record or patient basis based on the dataset.
*   Gross margin is the spread between what we charge Requestors and what Partners charge us.
*   As automation and network density grow, gross margins expand.

| Category                      | Price                     | Margin |
| :---------------------------- | :------------------------ | :----- |
| Annual Platform               | $10,000 to $100,000       | 90%    |
| Record Request (End to End)   | $50 Per Record            | 20%    |
| Record Request (Routing)      | $5 Per Record             | 80%    |
| Site Sonar                    | $15 Per Patient           | 66%    |
| HIPAA Checker and Site Finder | $1 Per Call               | 50%    |

## Slide 16: Strategic Vision & Goals

**Strategic Vision & Goals**

To Win the Network we Must Execute on the Strategic Goals Below.

**Phase 1: Relevance**
Build Atomic Network
Build the smallest minimum viable network to validate requestor and custodian interest

**Phase 2: Ubiquity**
Achieve Requestor and Custodian Ubiquity
Use the momentum to create network to create a self-reinforcing flywheel effect and gravitational pull.
*We are Here* (Indicated as current phase)

**Phase 3: Scale**
Expand to New Markets
Use the network density to expand into more markets.

**Phase 4: Monetize**
Unlock New Use Cases

## Slide 17: MOAT

**MOAT**

Hermes Health's Moat = Network Density × Neutrality × Economies of Scale × Product Velocity

**Connection Density**
More Custodian connections mean fewer reasons for Requestors to build their own. Each link strengthens the network.

**Neutrality**
We don't compete with Custodians or our Requestors—our neutrality builds trust and drives adoption.

**Economies of Scale**
More volume allows us to negotiate lower Custodian costs, enabling us to pass these savings to our Requestors.

**Products Velocity**
Our workflow innovations make data exchange seamless for Custodians and Requestors. This speed lets us outperform networks of similar size with slower product cycles.

## Slide 25: Partners Can't Be The Center

**Partners Can't Be The Center**

**Why Can't Partners Be The Center**

*   **Competitive Conflict:** Partners compete with each other, making it difficult for any single partner to act as a neutral hub for all.
*   **Limited Footprint:** Individual partners have a limited footprint on a patient data record. As a result they cannot fulfill all requests.
*   **Trust:** Partners don't trust each other and as a result hesitate to share proprietary information directly with each other, restricting cooperation.
*   **Complex Integration:** Direct connections among multiple partners create costly complexity, duplication, and labor.
