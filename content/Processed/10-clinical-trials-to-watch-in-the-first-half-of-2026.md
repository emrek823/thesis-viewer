10 clinical trials to watch in the first half of 2026

After a lengthy downturn, the biotech industry finally gathered momentum in 2025. Key readouts in obesity, infectious disease and many rare conditions could help it continue.

For the first time in a while, the biotechnology industry starts a new year with momentum.

Large dealmaking has picked up, driving returns for public investors as well as the firms that form and build new drug startups. Multiple biotechs successfully grew sales of new medicines and, as a result, were rewarded with higher market values and lucrative stock offerings. In tandem, the generalist investors that abandoned biotech during a lengthy pullback have, at least for now, returned. A stock index viewed as a barometer of biotech’s health climbed by a third last year, reaching levels not seen since the bubbly days of the pandemic. The first trillion-dollar drugmaker emerged along the way.

Clinical trial results have fueled many of these outcomes, spurring interest from acquirers or investors. This year, other important readouts lay ahead in obesity, infectious diseases, rare disorders and more.

Here are 10 to watch in the first half:

Eli Lilly

Triumph-1, Triumph-2, Triumph-3

Over the last year or so, Eli Lilly has seized control of the fast-evolving obesity drug market and, in the process, become by far the world’s most valuable drugmaker. Lilly’s top treatment is now the world’s best selling drug, and the company soon stands to launch one of the first oral “incretin” medicines for weight loss.    .

Lilly could further cement its leading position this year, when a  series of studies on a drug called retatrutide produce results.

The drug targets a metabolic pathway called glucagon in addition to the GLP-1 and GIP that Lilly’s fast-selling Zepbound does — a triple-acting effect that could enhance weight loss. Zepbound set a high bar by helping people with obesity lose up to 21% of their body weight over more than a year. But in a Phase 3 trial in a type of knee pain last year, retatrutide delivered even more drastic results, spurring average weight loss of as much as nearly 29% and, in some cases, more than 35%.

Those findings put the obesity field “on notice,” Evercore ISI analyst Umer Raffat wrote in December. But they also weren’t from a study truly designed to maximize weight loss.

Those studies lay ahead, and the first three, titled Triumph-1, -2 and -3, are due to read out toward the middle of the year. The first is a straightforward trial in people with obesity. The second is in people with obesity and diabetes, while the third is in those with obesity and established cardiovascular disease, as defined by a previous heart attack or stroke. Combined, the trials have enrolled more than 5,000 people.

Success in these studies would keep Lilly ahead of a raft of emerging competitors — among them chief rival Novo Nordisk, which is currently trying to win approval of a dual-acting therapy. Novo has its own version of retatrutide in early-stage human trials, meaning it will surely be at least a few years before the company can directly compete with Lilly in the triple-acting obesity drug market. — Jonathan Gardner
