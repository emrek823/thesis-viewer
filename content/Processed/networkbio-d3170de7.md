## Slide 2: 2. PROBLEM
2. PROBLEM
Today, Precision Medicine's flywheel spins in Oncology. Our vision is to initiate this
flywheel for all other disease.

In Oncology, clinico-
genomic data is the
basis of the flywheel

REGULATORY

therapies +companion diagnostics

BIOPHARMA
design drugs, stratify patients
& recruit trials on the basis of
genomic biomarkers

PROVIDERS
utilize genomic/ multi-omic
data in clinical care to define
course of treatment

Clinico-genomic

## Slide 4: 4. BIOBANK FAQs
4. BIOBANK FAQs
1. What is a biobank & what is their purpose, what're they like?
    * Biobanks are biorepositories containing samples (mostly blood, tissue, saliva) that have been consented for research or commercial uses (eg sequencing)
    * Biobanks are typically standalone departments loosely affiliated with health systems (generally non-profit institutions)
    * First and foremost - biobanks want to get their samples sequenced for clinical decision making and academic research purposes
2. How many samples are in biobanks across the US?
    * Approximately 624 biobanks across the US (link)
    * Previous estimates cite ~60% of the US population have consented their samples to biobanks (stat is from 1999! - link)
3. What are biobanks' key challenges?
    * Need for information technology vendors and investment to make sample libraries queryable and computable
        * “If one were to be asked what the closest partner and most significant part of Biobanking in the 21st century will be, then Information Technology would be the right answer. Information technology, in other words, is the foundation on which future biobanking rests" (link)
    * Financial sustainability (not financially self-sufficient)
    * Variability across sample prep and storage quality standards
    * Lack of corresponding clinical data harmonization
4. Why have so few samples been sequenced?
    * Biobanks collect samples because it is very limited incremental cost to them ( part of routine clinical care from their corresponding system)
    * Biobanks are not commercial enterprises and fundamentally do not view samples as an economic asset
    * This creates a lack of commercial investment and operational efficiency in biobanking (sample prep, quality control, deal making, etc)
5. Why does BioPharma want these samples?
    * BioPharma has specific and evolving needs for these samples - they want to sequence a small number of choice cohorts
    * Biobanks want batch sequencing, Pharma wants only high value samples to be sequenced
    * Therefore, majority of samples in the US have not been sequenced because most are not worth Pharma pursuing
6. What is the takeaway?
    * Biobanks have an extremely valuable “natural resource"
    * The value of this asset / resource has not been realized due to a highly inefficient interaction between biobanks and biopharma

## Slide 5: 5. SOLUTION: "THE US BIOBANK"
5. SOLUTION: "THE US BIOBANK"
We are creating the largest (& only) unified network of biobanks. Our platform connects
researchers to selectively sequence & enrich clinico-genomic records.

(Map of USA with white dots representing biobanks)

Biobank Insights
* Started from gov't funding, loosely linked to health systems
* Run by academics - don't view samples as economic asset
* Key motivation is to get the biorepository sequenced
* Financial sustainability is a significant challenge
* Desire for unified technology to query sample library

Biopharma Insights
* Desire to purchase incremental, targeted cohorts
* Challenged by the data variability across biobanks
* Inefficient interactions with biobanks limit value creation

## Slide 6: 6. OPPORTUNITY
6. OPPORTUNITY
A fully sequenced dataset from 1% of the US Biobanks would rival the best clinico-
genomic datasets, at a significant fraction of the cost

Clinico-genomic datasets in the market today

| Company / Program | Records | Details | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| FOUNDATION MEDICINE flatiron | ~50k records | Acquire by Roche $1.9B (Flatiron) $2.4B (FMI) | |
| "T'EMPUS | ~100k records | Raised ~1B+ Run rate of ~20M / mon | |
| biobank Improving the health of future generations | 500k records | Took 7 years for first readout | Cost: $1B+ in NHS funding |
| Genomics england | 100k records | | Cost: $750M+ in NHS funding |
| All of Us RESEARCH PROGRAM | Aspire 1M records | | Cost: $1.5B in NIH funding |

## Slide 7: 7. RWE 3.0
7. RWE 3.0
BioPharma capture value from digital representation of patients, called RWE. We are building
the premier RWE 3.0 company.

| RWE Stage | Description | Key Elements | Source | Value Proposition |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| RWE 1.0 | Usage Grade from Claims | - Drug usage and cost | Sourced from Insurers | |
| RWE 2.0 | Clinical Grade Claims + EHR | - Drug usage and cost <br> - Patient journey <br> - Mapping outcomes <br> - Clinical algorithms | Sourced from Health Systems | |
| RWE 3.0 | Regulatory Grade Claims + EHR + Genomic | - Drug usage and cost <br> - Patient journey <br> - Mapping outcomes <br> - Clinical algorithms <br> - Target discovery & validation <br> - Molecularly stratified trials <br> - Digital Pathology | | Massive value in bringing the next-gen of RWE datasets online |

**Multi-Omic Data Lake**
Stores all raw omics data output from sequencers and standardized pipeline that perform sequence alignment and classification / quantification of molecular alterations (e.g. transforms FASTQ to BAMs to VCFs)

**Computable Data Layer**
Raw clinical and genomics data transformed into computable structured data tables using NLP algorithms, automated bioinformatics workflows etc

**Biopharma Cohort Exploration Platform**
Web portal where biopharma scientists query and explore datasets and sample availability from biobanks, request for specific data modalities to be generated, and purchase multimodal data
