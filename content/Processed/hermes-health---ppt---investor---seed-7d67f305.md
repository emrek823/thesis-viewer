## Slide 5: Why Now?

The De-identified World does not Understand Identified Use Cases
The Identified World does not know the De-identified World Exists

These Two Worlds are Setup to Merge

**Table: World Comparison**

| De-Identified World (2010-2025)                                                                | Identified World                                                                                     |
| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Built comfort exchanging health data across 1,000+ sources                                     | Largely unaware that health data can be traded or licensed                                           |
| Market is mature; data is commoditized                                                         | Still rely on fax and manual record requests                                                         |
| Growth pressure is creating push for new markets and use cases                                 | Few know how to license or value health data                                                         |
| Limited knowledge of use cases that require identified health data – this was intentional as cultural norm | Early APIs from Epic, Athena, Office Ally, Waystar are creating data liquidity                       |
|                                                                                                | However the market lack technical acuity to implement                                                |

**Image:** Two swirling, interconnected vortexes of light and color (orange, pink, purple) against a dark background, visually representing the merging of two worlds.

## Slide 6: Problem: Identified Data is Stuck in the Past

Access to Identified Data is Fragmented, Full of Friction, and Labor Intensive

**The Problem**

HIEs and TEFCA were designed to enable seamless health data exchange but in practice, its made it worse.

Access to identified data is still full of friction.

*   **Fragmentation:** 1,000+ data custodians with limited footprint and coverage.
*   **Friction:** Labor cost of $100 to pull one medical record
*   **Confusion:** Varying channels to get medical records: fax, bespoke requestor portals, and limited APIs.

**Image:** A circular network diagram showing various entities connected by lines, representing a complex and fragmented data exchange environment.

**Entities (clockwise from top):**
*   Patient Registry
*   CRO
*   Health Plan
*   Clinic
*   EHR
*   Claims
*   Hospital
*   ROI
*   Imaging
*   Law Firm
*   Life Insurance

## Slide 7: Solution: One Network. One API. One Workflow.

Unlocking Identified Data Requires a Trusted Network that Connects Requestors and Custodians to Reduce Friction, Reduce Turnaround Times, and Enforce Rules.

**Table: Requestors and Custodians**

| Requestors           | Custodians               |
| :------------------- | :----------------------- |
| Law Firms            | Release of Information   |
| Life Insurance       | Claims Clearinghouses    |
| Health Plans         | EHR Software             |
| CRO's                | Imaging Software         |
| Healthcare Operations | Hospitals                |
| Patient Registries   | Clinics                  |

**Image:** A circular network diagram with "HERMES HEALTH" at the center, connected to all the same entities as in Slide 6, but with "HERMES HEALTH" as the central hub.

**Entities (clockwise from top):**
*   Patient Registry
*   CRO
*   Health Plan
*   Clinic
*   EHR
*   Claims
*   Hospital
*   ROI
*   Imaging
*   Law Firm
*   Life Insurance

**Central Hub:** HERMES HEALTH logo

## Slide 8: Network Effect & Value

Hermes Provides Value to Both the Requestor and the Custodian. Creating a Reinforcing Flywheel effect.

**Table: Requestor and Custodian Value**

| Requestor                             | Custodian                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| :------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Faster Turnaround:** More Revenue   | **More Demand:** More Revenue                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Data comes back in minutes instead of weeks | Hermes reduces the friction to request and deliver data; inducing demand for the Custodian's data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **More Data:** More Revenue           | **Implementation Burden:** Less Cost                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| More data enables Requestors to unlock new markets and use cases. | Hermes handles integrations with Requestors so Custodians don't have to manage one-off tech implementations and maintenance.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Less Overhead:** Less Cost          | **Scalable Intake:** Less Cost                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| One API to submit and retrieve identified health data no more bespoke connections, integrations, and maintenance. | Requests arrives in a single, standardized format. Unlocking lower operational cost, faster routing, and simplified scaling.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

**Image:** A circular flywheel diagram with "Hermes Health Flywheel Effect" in the center. Arrows point clockwise, illustrating the reinforcing effect:
*   Faster and Easier Records → More Requestors
*   More Requestors → More Record Volume
*   More Record Volume → More Vendors Integrate to Capture Volume
*   More Vendors Integrate to Capture Volume → Faster and Easier Records

**Footnote:** Confidential

## Slide 9: Hermes Access & Delivery Layer

Our Access and Delivery Layer Connects Requestor to Custodians

**Access and Delivery Layer**

*   **Intake:** Requestors securely submit patient's full name, date of birth, and a signed HIPAA Authorization form.
*   **Smart Routing:** The Unity Platform then routes these requests to our network of Custodians.
*   **Partner Fulfillment:** Custodians processes these Requests and transmit data back to Hermes
*   **Delivery:** Hermes delivers the data back to Requestors without revealing Custodian specific infrastructure—protecting privacy, and confidentiality
*   **Transparent Pricing:** Custodian is paid on a per-record/patient fee.

## Slide 14: The Business Model

We have a Simple Pricing that Scales as our Network Grows.

**Business Model**

*   Hermes monetizes the Requestors.
*   Hermes pays the Custodian on a per record or patient basis based on the dataset.
*   Gross margin is the spread between what we charge Requestors and what Partners charge us.
*   As automation and network density grow, gross margins expand.

**Table: Pricing Structure**

| Category                  | Price                    |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------- |
| Annual Platform           | $10,000 to $100,000      |
| Record Request            | $50 Per Record           |
| Site Sonar                | $15 Per Patient          |
| HIPAA Checker and Site Finder | $1 Per Call              |
| Smart Router              | $5 per Record            |

## Slide 15: Strategic Vision & Goals

To Win the Network we Must Execute on the Strategic Goals Below.

**Image:** A growth curve illustrating four phases of strategic goals. The curve starts low and steadily rises, with an upward inflection point between Phase 2 and Phase 3. A "We are Here" marker is placed in Phase 2.

**Phases:**

*   **Phase 1: Relevance**
    *   Build Atomic Network
    *   Build the smallest minimum viable network to validate requestor and custodian interest

*   **Phase 2: Ubiquity**
    *   Achieve Requestor and Custodian Ubiquity
    *   Use the momentum to create network to create a self-reinforcing flywheel effect and gravitational pull.
    *   **We are Here** (indicated on the curve within this phase)

*   **Phase 3: Scale**
    *   Expand to New Markets
    *   Use the network density to expand into more markets.

*   **Phase 4: Monetize**
    *   Unlock New Use Cases

## Slide 17: Use of Funds

Hermes Health's Moat = Network Density × Neutrality × Economies of Scale × Product Velocity

**Connection Density**
The more custodians Hermes connects to us in each market segment, the less it makes sense for Requestors to build their own links. Add to our network density.

**Neutrality**
Because Hermes doesn't compete with custodians, they're more willing to connect with us than with other networks. Our neutrality builds trust at scale.

**Economies of Scale**
As volume grows, we negotiate better rates from Custodians and pass savings to Requestors driving more usage and reinforcing our lead.

**Products Velocity**
Hermes is constantly building features to make it easier for Custodians and Requestors to facilitate the exchange of the data. This Product velocity enables us to compete with networks of the same of the same size that have lower velocity.

## Slide 22: Partners Can't Be The Center

**Why Can't Partners Be The Center**

*   **Competitive Conflict:** Partners compete with each other, making it difficult for any single partner to act as a neutral hub for all.
*   **Limited Footprint:** Individual partners have a limited footprint on a patient data record. As a result they cannot fulfill all requests.
*   **Trust:** Partners don't trust each other and as a result hesitate to share proprietary information directly with each other, restricting cooperation.
*   **Complex Integration:** Direct connections among multiple partners create costly complexity, duplication, and labor.

**Image:** An illustration depicting a group of stern-faced individuals, implying disagreement or conflict within a partnership. The central figure appears frustrated or overwhelmed, surrounded by others looking on with various degrees of concern or suspicion.
