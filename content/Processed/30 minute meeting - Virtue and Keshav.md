### Company Background & Problem

- Founded by Keshav and Moe in early 2024 after exploring various side projects
- Both founders have personal healthcare access experiences that drove mission
- Problem: CMS-funded healthcare facilities (400k+) spend only 35% of time on patient care
- Rest of time spent on documentation and proving quality care delivery
- $7B recovered from HHS audits last year, indicating increasing scrutiny

### Product Solution

- AI agent for CMS-funded facilities
- Creates CMS-compliant charts at point of service
- Automates administrative burden around clinical documentation
- Features include:
	- Regulatory compliance checking
	- Pre-claim scrubbing
	- Auto-remediation of defects
	- Automated form filling for CMS requirements

### Traction & Customer Example

- Working with American Premier (West Coast/Arizona-based hospice)
	- $13k contract in redlining stage
	- Started with nurse administrator Jackie James
	- Expanded from review product to frontline clinician use
	- Now expanding to palliative care division

### Business & Fundraising

- Current raise: $3M with $1M lead secured
- Terms: $12M post-money valuation
- Growth targets:
	- 12,000 frontline clinicians by end of next year
	- $1.5M ARR target by end of next year
- Focus areas:
	- Quality guidelines review
