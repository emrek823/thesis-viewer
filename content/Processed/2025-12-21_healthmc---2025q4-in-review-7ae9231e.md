Hi everyone,

As we wrap up Q4, I wanted to share a brief update on what we've accomplished and we're focused on heading into 2026.

## Key Updates

### Strategy

As most of you know our product offering to this point focused on executing end to end on retrospective risk adjustment for our customers, from coding to submission file creation. This had some significant advantages:
* Fast to market
* Immediate access to diverse and relevant data sources
* Low dependence on AI for value delivery

However, it came with some significant drawbacks as well:
* High operational intensity and expense
* Low(er) margins
* Competition from internal coding teams

Doing this was critical for us to gain the insights needed for a great product but we have known for some time that this was not what we intended to scale. Starting in around Q3 we had enough data and operating experience to massively expand the capabilities of our platform:
* Breakthrough, high performance models
* Standardized data flows and pipelines
* Accurate filtering of irrelevant charts
* Automation of core workflows

We have spent the last two quarters executing on these and have opened up new market possibilities because of it.

### Platform Progress

Over Q3 and Q4, we've made significant advancements to our platform:
* Core modeling Improvements
* Integration of reinforcement learning
* Client-specific model calibration
* Improved handling of edge cases

We are now training and using our own proprietary models, based on datasets that we have created and curated.

As a result, our core performance metrics are the strongest they've been to date:
* HCC precision: ~92%
* HCC recall (chart-level): ~98%
* HCC recall (person-level): >99%

### What these metrics enable

These results allow us to reliably identify the ~5%-25% of encounters where essentially all novel diagnoses reside. (The range varies by customer based on diagnosis density – customers with more upside need to review more charts to fully realize the opportunity.)

By dramatically narrowing the review surface area:
* Customers can materially reduce labor costs in AI-only workflows
* We can materially reduce internal costs in AI + Human review workflows

This has a number of important impacts:
* Significant margin improvements in our full service product lines making these viable to expand
* Creation of a new AI-only offering, with attractive pricing, value delivery, and margins (>80%)

Overall, this improved performance supports us delivering 10x+ ROI in engagements.

### AI-Only Traction

We're seeing early but encouraging traction for our AI-only motion:
* We're wrapping up an AI-only commercial pilot with a provider group covering 100K+ at-risk patients, with the goal of converting to a broader contract in Q1.
* We preempted a planned AI+human commercial pilot with another large provider group (also 100K+ at-risk patients) in favor of a larger AI-only deployment, which has already kicked off.
* We're in the process of converting several existing customers to a platform-first, AI-only approach heading into 2026.

### Exploring Adjacencies

In parallel, we're actively exploring adjacent workflows where our platform can add value:
* With existing customers:
    * Concurrent review
    * Quality measure abstraction
* With prospective customers:
    * CDI use cases
    * DRG upcoding detection for payors

### Upcoming Focus

Looking ahead, our priorities are:
* Driving growth through expansion within existing customers
* Moving from pilots covering portions of a business to contracts covering much broader scope
* Expanding the footprint of our offering, including:
    * Concurrent review
    * Quality measures
* Partnering on data acquisition via HIEs and TEFCA-enabled networks
* Expanding the funnel:
    * We're conducting dozens of product research conversations with existing and prospective customers
    * Many of these discussions have already converted into active prospects

## Asks

We'd welcome introductions to prospective customers, ideally framed as product research for adjacent GenAI-powered use cases. This framing has been effective and has allowed us to engage financial, compliance, and clinical leaders.

We'll also be in San Francisco for JPM, and would love any introductions we could pursue live while we're there.

Wishing everyone a happy holiday season and New Year.

Best,
Judah
