EYLEA HD and EYLEA net sales were impacted by inventory fluctuations, with a $40 million favorable impact in the third quarter expected to negatively affect fourth-quarter sales.

The anti-VEGF category, including EYLEA, faces significant pricing pressure due to competition from branded and biosimilar products.

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:REGN) anticipates ongoing competitive challenges in the anti-VEGF category, including the entry of biosimilars.

The company faces potential erosion of market share for EYLEA due to the launch of biosimilars, although the impact is yet to be fully determined.

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:REGN) has not provided specific guidance on the conversion rate from EYLEA to EYLEA HD, indicating uncertainty in market dynamics.

Q: With Alnylam launching their biosimilar, how are you thinking about EYLEA going forward? And what levels can you pull to potentially accelerate conversion to high-dose EYLEA?A: Leonard Schleifer, CEO: EYLEA is a fantastic product with a strong track record of safety and performance. We believe EYLEA HD is differentiated, and we are focusing on educating doctors about its benefits. Despite the competitive landscape, we are confident in our ability to compete effectively.

Q: Can you reiterate your confidence in EYLEA HD quarter-over-quarter growth going into Q4 despite the negative impact due to wholesaler inventory?A: Marion McCourt, EVP Commercial: We have strong confidence in EYLEA HD's profile and the interest from the retina community. However, we did see an inventory impact in Q3, which will affect Q4. We are confident in EYLEA HD's performance and expect continued growth.

Q: Can you talk about the potential inflection in use that the HD prefilled syringe could catalyze next year?A: Leonard Schleifer, CEO: We anticipate bringing the prefilled syringe to market by mid-next year, which could lead to an inflection in use due to physician preference for prefilled syringes. We are ensuring it meets high safety standards to avoid issues like inflammation.

Q: How are you thinking about the pace of R&D investments going forward or your capital allocation priorities?A: Leonard Schleifer, CEO: We are focused on bringing innovative products to market and will continue to invest in our robust pipeline. We have a strong balance sheet and earnings to support significant investments, and we are committed to driving long-term growth.

Q: Can you elaborate on the drivers for the pricing pressure noted for EYLEA HD and whether these pressures are ongoing?A: Marion McCourt, EVP Commercial: Pricing pressure is a factor across the anti-VEGF category, but EYLEA HD's clinical profile, safety, and durability are key differentiators. We expect the category to grow in the mid-single-digit range, and we are well-positioned to compete successfully.
