### Healthcare vs P&C Insurance Challenges

- P&C vs. Healthcare differences
	- Can’t intervene in healthcare like P&C - not legally permitted
	- Data extremely lagged from time perspective
	- Claims paid out 2+ years after incidents
- Legal vulnerabilities
	- Automatic lawsuit losses when treatments deemed medically necessary
	- Even when contracts explicitly exclude XYZ coverage

### Reinsurance Market Dynamics

- Pearl’s capacity search (1+ years)
	- Struggling to find reinsurance partners
	- Few firms write ACO lines anymore
	- Quota share particularly difficult vs stop-loss
	- Too many burned by quota share arrangements
- Success requires strong reinsurer relationships + trusted underwriting models
- Sparx underwriting quality
	- Kelly (Puerto Rico team) conducted full assessment
	- “Strongest underwriting she’s ever seen”
	- High confidence investment signal

### Gene Therapy Cost Surge

- Takeda utilization spike example
	- Major reinsurer: 2 cases last year → 17 cases this year
	- Completely changed underwriting mathematics
- Growth slower than expected but accelerating
- High-cost drug utilization creating new risk models
- Centers of excellence partnerships emerging for gene/cell therapy

### Next Steps

- Jimmy offered to help with reinsurance/risk insights for portfolio companies
- Emre planning SF visit before year-end
- Coffee/drinks planned when in town
- Brian catch-up scheduled (situation now public vs previously confidential)
