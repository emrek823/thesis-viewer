# Translucent

Building the Financial Nervous System of Healthcare.

*   **Product:** First agentic platform purpose-built for healthcare finance
*   **Live:** 2 enterprise customers (>$2B revenue each) • ARR: $625K
*   **Growth last 4-Months:** 5x ARR expansion
*   **Sales cycles:** ~3 months at $1B+ logos (vs ~18 months legacy)
*   **Pipeline:** $15M+ founder-led; CARR $905K → $2.3M projected EOY
*   **Category:** $60B annual provider finance spend (Labor & SaaS)

We replace spreadsheet "glue work” with an Al analyst that delivers trusted FP&A answers in real time at enterprise scale.

## Why We Started Translucent

I've spent my career in the trenches of healthcare operations—doing everything I could to accelerate financial performance. I built and rebuilt EHRs, billing platforms, and claims systems; re-engineered data infrastructure and analytics teams; and led finance transformation efforts across billion-dollar provider organizations.

But the same problem kept surfacing everywhere I went:

💡 Healthcare Financial analysis feels like daily hand-to-hand combat, manual, messy, and exhausting

I've seen how finance teams are under immense pressure. They're expected to act like strategic partners: forecasting performance, identifying savings, and guiding growth.

But they're stuck in the mud:

*   Pulling disconnected data
*   Reconciling broken spreadsheets
*   Fighting outdated tools
*   Running extremely complex revenue and expense scenarios
*   Managing version control nightmares
*   Supporting an overwhelming volume of requests / needs across the org

All while needing to be highly specialized domain experts in different revenue models, specialties, financial processes.

I've seen this lead to basic financial analysis and reports taking weeks to compile.

## By the time insights and recommendations are delivered, the moment to act has already passed.

*   Executives are flying blind
*   Operators are stuck guessing
*   Physicians lose trust
*   Patients feel the consequences

## This isn't just inefficient, it's dangerous

In a $2.5 trillion industry running on razor-thin 1-2% margins, small financial missteps can trigger clinic closures, hiring freezes, and cuts to care.

Financial Performance isn't just about numbers, it's about access to healthcare.

## I've Lived This First Hand

*   **CIO at ChenMed, $3.5B VBC Provider,** when operators understood their numbers to make daily financial decisions, they doubled performance. When they didn't, clinics shut down.
*   **CIO at Mount Sinai Health System (downtown region),** I watched Beth Israel, a major hospital in the heart of Manhattan—shut its doors after years of financial underperformance.
*   **CIO at Springfield Clinic,** on the flip side in three years leading tech, data analytics and rev cycle we grew from $900M to $2.5B and expanded access from 400,000 to over 1 million patients.

## 💡 Our Positive Vision of the Future

What if we could change that? In 5 years every provider will have an AI operating System that helps the entire organization make the right financial decision at the right time. No matter what happens in the future, running the business will always require great financial stewardship.

What if we could return just **1% of the $2.5 trillion** in provider revenue back to the system as operating margin?

That alone would represent a **$25 billion annual insurgence of capital,** money that could be reinvested in access, staffing, and innovation across the country.

But we can go further.

**Top-decile performers like HCA operate over 10% operating margin**—10x better performance than most health systems.

If even the market could reach half of HCA performance at 5%, it would unlock over **$125 billion in annual value,** enough to change the trajectory of care delivery in America.

Meanwhile, if we don't act, **600 rural health systems could shut down, leaving 5 million people without access to care.** We're standing at a tipping point.

## That's why we started Translucent.

We want to help every healthcare provider in the country to achieve **maximal financial performance,** to expand access, protect frontline staff, and return **billions of dollars** back into the communities that need it most.

It starts with **rebuilding the financial nervous system of healthcare.**

That's why we've built the first **Agentic System** solely focused on **Healthcare Financial Performance,** a system that automates the manual, surfaces real-time insight, and empowers every team to make better decisions, faster.

Because in a world of shrinking margins and rising pressure, **financial clarity isn't a luxury, it's a lifeline.**

But this isn't an easy task.

## Why Does Healthcare Finance Need a Specialized Solution?

In most industries, the Finance function is straightforward: revenue is tied to sales or subscriptions, costs are predictable, and margins are consistent. In healthcare, **none of that holds true.** Financial planning and analysis is more operational, more fragmented, and significantly harder to scale.

### Example: SaaS Company vs. Healthcare Company

| Concept            | SaaS Company Example                  | Healthcare Example                                                                 |
| :----------------- | :------------------------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Revenue Recognition | $100/user/month billed automatically  | Depends on patient visit, insurance, denial rates; payment arrives months later    |
| Forecasting Volume | Based on web traffic and marketing conversion | Based on clinic capacity, physician schedules, population health, seasonality      |
| Pricing Model      | Transparent, fixed pricing tiers      | Negotiated payer contracts, risk-based arrangements, CPT code complexity           |
| Margins            | Consistent gross margins across products | Varies wildly by procedure, department, payer mix                                  |
| Cost Attribution   | Server + support costs per user       | Indirect cost allocation across missions (clinical, research, education)           |
| Data Sources       | Revenue from Stripe + CRM + ERP       | General Ledger + EHR + Rev Cycle + HRIS + Benchmarks + Excel budgets               |

## Going Deeper: Why is Healthcare FP&A so Complex?

### 1. Revenue Is Lagged, Negotiated, and Nonlinear

Unlike most industries, healthcare revenue doesn't happen at the point of service. Payments come weeks or months after care is delivered, based on complex payer contracts, government programs, and claims adjudication.

Example: A surgery in January may not be paid until April and even then, it may be underpaid, denied, or bundled.

### 2. Provider Compensation Models Are Complex and Ever-Changing

Physicians are paid through multi-variable structures: base salary, productivity (RVUs), quality bonuses, capitation incentives, or academic stipends. These need to be modeled, forecasted, and validated not just processed.

Example: A doctor's pay may change month to month based on patient volume, procedure mix, and payer type.

### 3. Critical Financial Data Lives in Siloed Systems

Key inputs are trapped in disconnected systems, GLs for expenses, EHRs for RVUs and encounters, revenue cycle systems for claims and denials, ERPs for headcount and comp, and Excel for forecasts.

FP&A teams spend weeks reconciling and aligning the truth, just to get to a baseline.

## The Downstream Effects of Extremely Complex FP&A Workflows

### Talent is rare and expensive

Great FP&A in healthcare requires deep domain expertise, strong technical skills, and clear communication. But these people are hard to find and costly to retain.

### And even the best teams get stuck in the mud

Even elite talent spends 80% of their time on mechanical work, pulling data, cleaning spreadsheets, and reconciling reports. Strategic analysis takes a back seat.

### Meanwhile, operators are flying blind

Physicians, service line leaders, and executives lack timely, trustworthy insights to make confident decisions. The data exists, but it's too slow, too fragmented, and too manual to drive action when it matters most.

⚠️ **Result: A $60B Patchwork Holding Up a 1% Margin Industry**

## Healthcare providers spend over $60 billion (~2-3% of total revenue) annually on labor, consultants, and software, just to patch together basic financial processes and answers.

Yet even with all that spend, most still operate on 1-2% margins, with critical decisions delayed or misinformed.

It's an unsustainable equation, where inefficiency is the default and access to care is at risk every time margins slip.

## Why Now? Providers Face Unprecedented Pressures

| Pressure Point                     | Resulting Shift                                                  |
| :--------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Margin compression                 | Boards are mandating structural cost savings                      |
| Analyst burnout & hiring freezes   | CFOs are seeking automation, not headcount                       |
| Legacy tools are too slow          | Buyers want real-time, self-serve financial analysis             |
| AI goes mainstream                 | Finance leaders believe AI can now deliver ROI                   |
| Operators Bonuses tied to performance | Operators rely on financial insights to make decisions over their departments |

### Product in Action: Complex Physician Productivity Analysis (Service Line)

(Can you provide a breakdown of physician productivity for cardiology last month?)

Of course, here is a summary of physician productivity for the Cardiology specialty for last month. Please note, this represents wRVU data for the physician as the servicing provider, it does not currently include wRVUs for physicians as the 'billing provider' (assuming they are not the servicing provider).

| Month | Sum of wRVU | MGMA Benchmark 75th Percentile | MGMA Benchmark 75th Percentile Achieved (%) | Sum of Charges (USD) | Sum of Hours Available | Sum of Encounters | Sum of Referrals | Sum of Hours Booked | Average Utilization (%) | FTE   |
| :---- | :---------- | :----------------------------- | :------------------------------------------ | :------------------- | :--------------------- | :---------------- | :--------------- | :------------------ | :---------------------- | :---- |
| Sep   | 18,915.54   | 22,305.22                      | 84.80%                                      | $3,743,614.00        | 1,802.83               | 5095              | 2351             | 1,673.50            | 92.82%                  | 58.20 |

This result was calculated by aggregating the sum of wRVU, charges, hours worked, encounters, referrals, and hours scheduled for the Cardiology specialty for the last month on record. The MGMA Benchmark 75th Percentile Achieved was calculated as the percentage ratio of the sum of wrvu to the MGMA Benchmark 75th Percentile each month. The Average Utilization by dividing the sum of hours scheduled by the sum of hours worked each month.

**Insights:** It is interesting to highlight that the Cardiology specialty achieved 84.80% of the MGMA 75th percentile benchmark last month, despite having a high average scheduled utilization of 92.82%. This suggests there might be opportunities to improve wRVU generation per encounter or optimize other factors contributing to productivity.

*   Unique external benchmarking analysis
*   Joining and analyzing EMR-relevant data
*   Joining and analyzing ERP-relevant data

| Prepare Internal service line performance meetings | 10-15 hrs     | ~20 to 30 minutes | 12 HOURS             |

## Our Product Path to Category Leadership:

1.  **Expand AI Analyst Capabilities**- We're continuing to automate the high-value analyses currently handled by human labor, including pharmacy spend reviews, payer contract modeling, and advanced margin analysis.
2.  **Build the System of Record + Action for Healthcare Finance** - We're evolving from an AI analyst into the operating system for provider finance, owning critical workflows such as service line P&Ls, budgets, forecasts, and cost accounting.
3.  **Unlock Proprietary Insights & Benchmarking IP** - As we scale across leading providers, Translucent builds a unique dataset of financial and operational performance that no horizontal tool can replicate.
    *   Enables real-time benchmarking across health systems, service lines, and compensation models
    *   Powers predictive modeling of margin opportunities and risks
    *   Strengthens our semantic layer, compounding accuracy and value with every new deployment

The long-term vision: become the **sole source of financial truth** for healthcare providers, where every operator, physician, and executive makes decisions on top of Translucent.

We are already getting pulled into this long-term vision.

## Why FP&A Is the Perfect Wedge

Financial Planning & Analysis is the strategic arm of the CFO. In healthcare, it's the ideal entry point for Translucent because:

*   It's a burning platform — leaders can't run the business without it.
*   It powers mission-critical workflows that drive financial and operational decisions.
*   It's currently manual and labor-intensive, handled by expensive, highly specialized analysts.
*   It's run in Excel and offline models, disconnected from enterprise systems.
*   It provides a natural map of data, business rules, and workflows across the finance stack.

By starting with FP&A, we eliminate the "human middleware" that stitches together legacy systems and spreadsheets just to deliver basic financial reports. Instead of replacing existing software, we free humans from mechanical work so they can focus on high-value, strategic finance.

## Long-Term Vision: Duly – Expansion in Motion

**Phase 1: Wedge → Mission-Critical FP&A Workflow (Physician Productivity)**

*   **$125K ARR (Live)** – Physician Productivity; Core FP&A workflow to understand daily, weekly, monthly health of the business. Requires multiple FTEs to accomplish and enable operations teams.

**Phase 2: Expand FP&A Workflows Across Enterprise Needs**

*   **$500K ARR (Live)** – APP productivity, daily / weekly intra-month revenue analysis, month-end budget variance, deep revenue insights (cpt-code mix, payer mix, etc.)

**Phase 3: Consolidation into Translucent as the System of Record for Key Workflows**

*   Duly currently has multiple tools on Onestream (P&L management) and Heisenberg (physician compensation). In the next phase, those systems are wound down and consolidated into a single Translucent platform - FP&A, Month-End P&L, Physician Comp.
*   We think this could represent an additional $250k-500k ARR to Translucent while eliminating redundant spend on legacy tools—driving both platform consolidation and deeper embeddedness.

## Core IP → Enduring Business → Unbeatable Moat

### Our Core IP

1.  **Healthcare-Specific Semantic Layer + Infrastructure**
    We unify fragmented financial data into a domain-specific semantic layer, embedded directly into workflows like P&Ls, budgeting, and forecasting. This makes us the **system of action for provider finance**—something horizontal FP&A tools cannot replicate. This work lives in the minds of financial analysts/SMEs at healthcare organizations and needs a ton of context work.
2.  **Proprietary Insights & Performance Dataset**
    Every deployment builds a unique dataset of financial and operational performance. This enables real-time benchmarking and predictive modeling, unlocking insights unavailable anywhere else. This is how people can compare themselves to the HCAs of the world and see how to get top performance.

Together, this semantic layer + performance dataset is IP that compounds with scale.

## 💡 How IP Becomes a Moat

*   **Flywheel & Network Effects** - Each new customer strengthens the dataset, improves benchmarking accuracy, and deepens workflow integration. More customers → stronger insights → higher embeddedness.
*   **High Switching Costs** - Once embedded into P&Ls, physician comp models, and budgets, Translucent becomes core infrastructure. Replacing us is costly, disruptive, and risky.
*   **Brand & Trust** - In healthcare finance, credibility matters. Our domain expertise and Top Tier Logos create network effects, if no CFO wants to get fired by not choosing Translucent.

## Our Plan: 2026 + 2027

### 2026: The Year of Land + Product Expansion

In just 11 months, with a 7-person team and only founder-led sales, we built a **$15M pipeline** in one of the hardest industries to sell into—compressing sales cycles from the traditional 18 months down to just **3 months.** This demonstrates an unmistakable product-market fit.

Our focus in 2026 is landing logos at scale and expanding core product capabilities:

*   **Build GTM Engine** → Scale from founder-led to category leadership, targeting top-tier logos and expanding pipeline coverage.
*   **Delivery Excellence** → Deploy FP&A Analyst, deliver exceptional results, and deepen relationships to create expansion momentum.
*   **Engineering Scale** → Expand team to build additional "financial work" capabilities that set the foundation for upsell and for owning the system of record layer.
*   **Target Economics** → $350K ACVs for top 30 providers = $10.5M Net-New ARR, **$12M Total ARR** (an aggressive, land-first pricing strategy).

*   **Strategic IP Value** → Every new logo builds the performance dataset and embeds our semantic layer deeper into core workflows. This compounds into **unique benchmarking, predictive insights, and switching costs**—the foundation of our long-term moat.

**2026 Burn:** ~$14.4M

**2026 Team:** ~47 people (Engineering 50%, Delivery 25%, Sales 25%)

### 2027: The Year of Growth + Customer Expansion

With logos landed, 2027 is about expansion, larger ACVs, and category leadership.

*   **Expand existing customers:** Grow 30 initial logos from $350K ACV → $1M+ ACV, driving ARR from $10.5M → $30M.
*   **Raise new deal size:** Increase starting ACV to $500K, with full suite package at $1M ACV (Analyst + Additional Capabilities+ System Record Layer).
*   **Land aggressively:** Add 50 new logos, across both large healthcare provider enterprises

## ARR Outlook by EoY 2027

*   $30M in expansion ARR from existing 30 customers
*   30 logos at $500K ACV (AI Analyst capabilities) = $15M ARR
*   20 logos at $1M (AI Analyst capabilities + financial system of action work) = $20M ARR
*   **Total = $65M ARR**

## The Team to Build A Category Defining Company

We've assembled a founding team with deep healthcare experience, technical excellence, and AI-native product DNA, exactly what it takes to build a category-defining company in vertical AI.

## The Category Is Ours to Define

We've proven the product-market fit, landed top-tier providers, and shown that sales cycles can be compressed from 18 months to 3.

The next stage is clear: scale aggressively, embed across the largest providers in the country, and define the new standard for healthcare finance.
