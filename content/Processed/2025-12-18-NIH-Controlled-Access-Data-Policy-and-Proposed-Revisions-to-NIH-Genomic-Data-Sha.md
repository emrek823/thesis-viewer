## Summary
NIH is proposing new standardized policies for protecting and sharing human research participant data, with a specific focus on creating more transparent and consistent controlled-access requirements for genomic research data. The proposed changes aim to simplify data sharing protocols and enhance data protection mechanisms across research institutions.

## Startup Angle
A startup could build a secure, HIPAA-compliant data management platform specifically designed for genomic research that helps researchers navigate the new NIH controlled-access requirements. Genomic data startups like Tempus, 23andMe, and Invitae would likely benefit from clearer data sharing guidelines, while a new startup could emerge to provide compliance and data governance software tailored to these evolving NIH standards.
