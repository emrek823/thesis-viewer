Hermes Console + UI

## Slide 4: The Problem

**The Problem**

Getting a complete medical record is still a 60-day, $100+ manual process with a ~15% failure.

*   **Fragmented**
    Varying channels to get medical records (fax, bespoke requestor portals, and limited APIs).
*   **Laborious**
    $100+ fully-loaded cost per record request (request labor + site fees).
*   **Slow**
    p90 60 days: Fax → follow-up → invoice → resend auth → record retrieved
*   **High Failure Rate**
    Records get rejected about 15% of the time due to wrong facility, missing authorization information, incomplete records
*   **Complicated by Regulations**
    TEFCA/HIEs can only serve treatment data exchange; non-treatment use cases cannot use them.

| Use Case Purpose        | Hermes | TEFCA + HIES |
| :---------------------- | :----- | :----------- |
| Treatment               | ✗      | ✓            |
| Legal (PI/Mass Tort)    | ✓      | ✗            |
| Life Insurance Underwriting | ✓      | ✗            |
| Health Plan Ops/Payment | ✓      | ✗            |
| Clinical Research       | ✓      | ✗            |

## Slide 5: The Market: Non-Treatment Use Cases

**The Market: Non-Treatment Use Cases**

145M record requests a year equals a $10B annual spend category begging for disruption.

**Annual Spend**

| Customer Type                          | Record Requests | Cost Per Record (Labor + Site Fees) |
| :------------------------------------- | :-------------- | :---------------------------------- |
| Attorneys (Mass Tort and Personal Injury) | 25M             | $100                                |
| Insurance (Life, Disability, Car, Workers) | 15M             | $100                                |
| Government                             | 1M              | $100                                |
| Life Science Companies                 | 4.5M            | $200                                |
| Health Plans                           | 100M            | $50                                 |
| **TOTAL**                              | **145,500,000** |                                     |

*   **TAM** $10B Non Treatment Use Cases Annual Spend
*   **Focus Today** $4B Law Firms + Insurance
*   **2026** $5B Health Plans
*   **2027** $1B Government + Life Sciences

Number of Requests per Year * $100 (Retrieval + Site Fees)
× ~20% Hermes Take Rate = $2.5B

## Slide 7: Solution: Hermes Network

**Solution: Hermes Network**

Requestors integrate once with Hermes and instantly get compliant access to health data across many sources

**One Network. One Workflow. One API.**

*   **Inputs**
    Patient auth + patient identifiers + request type
*   **Hermes Middleware**
    Authorization validation + route optimization
    routing to best source + audit trail
*   **Outputs**
    Record delivered + status + provenance + billing + audit trail
*   **Example**
    Legal case → submit auth to Hermes → facility matched → routed to ROI source → record delivered by ROI → law firm picks it up → customer invoiced

**Diagram:**

(Top layer: Requestors)
Law Firm, Car Insurance, CRO, Pharma, Health Plan, Life Insurance, Government, Diagnostic Company

(Middle layer)
**Hermes - Middleware**

(Bottom layer: Data Sources)
ROI Vendors, Claims, EHR, Facilities

## Slide 8: From Network → Packaged Solutions

**From Network → Packaged Solutions**

We take our network and then build simple product wedges that compound into a platform as connectivity grows.

| Product/Solution      | Icon                                                    | Description                                                               | Launch Date    |
| :-------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :------------- |
| **Hermes Console + API** | Magnifying glass                                        | Request and Receive Data                                                  | Live Today     |
| **Site Sonar**        | Building with multiple windows                          | Find Facilities Where the Patient has visited                             | Live Today     |
| **Patient Histories** | Person icon                                             | Find RX, Diagnosis, and Procedures for a Patient                          | Q1 2026 Launch |
| **Fast Lane (ROI)**   | Box with arrows, "X" in top left/right                  | Retrieve Full Medical Records                                             | Q1 2026 Launch |
| **Fast Lane (EHR)**   | Box with arrows, "X" in top left/right, and a building | Retrieve Full Medical Records (Same icon as previous, but with building) | Q2 2026 Launch |

## Slide 9: Business Model

**Business Model**

We monetize the requestors with simple usage pricing

**Business Model**
Hermes monetizes the Requestors.
Hermes pays the Data Source
Gross margin is the spread between what we charge Requestors and what Data Source charge us.
Gross Margin expands as our network grows

**Pricing Table**

| Category          | Price                       | Gross Margin |
| :---------------- | :-------------------------- | :----------- |
| Site Sonar        | $15 Per Patient             | 66%          |
| Patient Histories | $50 Per Patient             | 50%          |
| Fast Lane - ROI   | $5 Per Record (+ Facility Fees) | 80%          |
| Fast Lane - EHR   | $50 Per Record              | 50%          |

**Example**
Retrieval firm pays us $15,000 a month
1,000 Site Sonar Requests @ $15 each

## Slide 10: Wedge: Site Sonar

**Wedge: Site Sonar**

Site Sonar solves the first major bottleneck – finding where a patient was treated – it's a major hit

**1st Product** Site Sonar

**1st Target Market** Record Retrieval Companies

*   **Problem**
    Patients don't remember where they have been treated.
*   **Medical Canvassing**
    Today the solution is "Medical Canvassing" where they call providers and ask them if the patient has been treated at the facility (seriously).
*   **Site Sonar**
    Site Sonar uses claims data – returning the locations where patients have been treated in 12 hours with zero manual effort.
    *   90% Hit Rate
    *   76% of all Claims Encounters
    *   2017 to Present

*   **Record Retrieval Companies**
    Law Firms and Insurance Companies outsource 50% of their request to Record Retrieval companies. The market includes 100+ vendors.
    High density of requests making them perfect to kick off the network

**Cumulative Site Sonar Patients** (Line Chart Data, estimated from image)

*   **Mar 30:** ~20 patients
*   **May 25:** ~100 patients
*   **Oct 12:** ~150 patients
*   **Oct 26:** ~200 patients
*   **Nov 9:** ~300 patients
*   **Nov 23:** ~400 patients
*   **Dec 7:** ~580 patients
*   **Dec 21, 2025:**
    *   Total Patients: 717
    *   New this week: +133

## Slide 11: Site Sonar Kills "Medical Canvassing"

**Site Sonar Kills "Medical Canvassing"**

Site Sonar cuts facility discovery from 7 days and $425 per patient to —12 hours and $15 per patient.

**Site Sonar**
*   Reduce Turnaround times
*   Less Cost
*   National Coverage
*   Simple User Experience
*   Secure & Compliant

| Metric          | In-House    | After Hermes |
| :-------------- | :---------- | :----------- |
| Turnaround Time | 4-7 Days    | 12 Hours     |
| Labor Time      | 20 Hours    | 1 Minute     |
| Cost            | $425        | $15          |
| Coverage        | Regional    | National     |
| Completeness    | 10%         | 76%          |

What you are building is a massive disruptor that will fill the void FHIR and TEFCA have left. I love it, and I applaud you for it!
Navigating the waters ahead, we are IN on helping, Alejandro!

## Slide 13: AI Automation Replaces Labor

**AI Automation Replaces Labor**

We turn labor driven steps into automated workflows, enabling us to expand margin and scale without labor.

**Hermes AI Native Workflows**
*   **HIPAA Checker**
    Analyzes a patient authorization to make sure it meets the minimum criteria
*   **Site Finder**
    Facility lookup tool that matches a given site name and address to existing sites in our database, returning results with confidence scores based on the AI's judgment.
*   **Site Researcher**
    Web research agent that automatically finds and validates a facilities contact information for: Medical Records, Billing, and Imaging/Radiology necessary to route record requests.

**AI Automation Table**

| Category      | Human Labor Time | Human Cost | Hermes AI Time | Hermes Cost |
| :------------ | :--------------- | :--------- | :------------- | :---------- |
| HIPAA Checker | 10 minutes       | $3         | 1 minute       | $0.15       |
| Site Finder   | 30 minutes       | $6         | 1 minute       | $0.20       |
| Site Researcher | 25 minutes       | $8         | 5 minutes      | $0.80       |

## Slide 14: Security & Compliance

**Security & Compliance**

We are handling identified PHI, so we've invested early in controls, audit trails, and SOC2-grade processes.

**Security & Compliance Milestones**
*   HIPAA Compliant Platform
*   SOC2 Type I: In Progress (Jan Target)
*   SOC2 Type II: In Progress (June Target)
*   Vanta Trust Center

(Images of HIPAA and SOC2 logos)

## Slide 15: Neutrality Is our Superpower

**Neutrality Is our Superpower**

The winning network can't be requestor or a data source centric—only a neutral trusted broker can build a network at scale.

**Why Hermes Wins**
Hermes wins because neutrality is the only model where rival data sources and requestors will join.
That trust drives connection density, which compounds into a durable network moat

**The Hermes Promise**
*   No front running data sources
*   No selling routing intelligence
*   Honor data source use case rules

**Why Other Networks Have Failed**
*   **Health Information Exchanges**
    HIE's ONLY allow treatment use cases and generate little economic value for the EHRs that power them.
*   **The Datasource Centric Network**
    A datasource acts as the default network, creating conflicts by prioritizing its own data in the fulfillment flow.
*   **The Requestor Centric Network**
    A retrieval company acts as the network, but competitors won't join because it exposes their customer lists, and makes their competitor stronger.

## Slide 16: Alternative Identified Health Networks

**Alternative Identified Health Networks**

One connection to Hermes unlocks non-treatment case cases across a fragmented ecosystem

**Alternative Network Axis**
*   Treatment vs Non Treatment
*   Partial Footprint vs National Footprint

**Why Hermes Wins**
Hermes is the only network that can support non-treatment use cases through one connection that is not owned by a data source or requestor.

**Matrix of Networks:**

|                           | **National Footprint**                                                                 | **Partial Footprint**                                                                       |
| :------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Treatment Use Case**    | Pluto, Particle, Citizen Health, Health Gorilla, **HERMES HEALTH**                       | Carequality, Health., Commonwell Health Alliance, Sacvalley Medshare, WISHIN                 |
| **Non Treatment Use Case** | ChartSwap (Sold to Ontellus 2019, Owned by Requestor), Clareto (Sold to MIB 2025, Owned by Requestor) | Epic, Change Healthcare, CVS Caremark, MRO, Office Ally, Verisma, ChartMate, Iron Mountain, Veradigm |

## Slide 17: Data Source Traction

**Data Source Traction**

We're converting data sources into live rails that enable us to build the product suite

**Network State**

**Data Source Logos**
*   Veritas Data Research
*   Office Ally
*   Waystar
*   Inovalon
*   Sharecare
*   Healthmark Group
*   MRO

| Category      | Implementing | Contracting | First Call | Pending |
| :------------ | :----------- | :---------- | :--------- | :------ |
| ROI Vendors   | 3            | 2           | 2          | 2       |
| Claims        | 4            | 4           | 3          | 4       |
| EHR (Require SOC 2) | 0            | 1           | 4          | 10      |
| Imaging       | 0            | 0           | 2          | 5       |

## Slide 18: The Flywheel & MOAT

**The Flywheel & MOAT**

Scaling the network and volume creates a self-reinforcing flywheel effect deepens the MOAT.

*   **Connection Density**
    Every new datasource reduces the need for customers to build bespoke integrations—and increases our routing success rate.
*   **Neutrality**
    We don't compete with data sources or customers, so adoption compounds across the ecosystem.
*   **Economies of Scale**
    Higher volume → lower datasource fees → lower customer cost → higher volume.
*   **Products Velocity**
    Shared workflow primitives let us ship improvements once and propagate them across every connection.

**Hermes Health Flywheel Effect Diagram:**

(Arrows depict clockwise flow)
*   More Data Available To Requestors
*   More Requestors
*   More Record Volume Equals more Revenue to Datasource
*   More to Data Sources join the Network

## Slide 19: Strategic Vision & Goals

**Strategic Vision & Goals**

The next phase is to use our momentum to scale our network and achieve escape velocity

| Phase 1: Relevance   | Phase 2: Ubiquity          | Phase 3: Scale          | Phase 4: Monetize           |

## Slide 20: Why Now

**Why Now**

5 forces are converging to create a one-in-decade window

*   **Neutral Networks Got Acquired**
    *   Chartswap sold to Ontellus (2019)
    *   Clareto sold to MIB (2025); both lost neutrality by selling
    *   A neutral rail does not exist today.
*   **TEFCA Excludes Non-Treatment Use Cases**
    *   HIE's and TEFCA serve treatment by design. Legal, insurance, life sciences use cases are locked out.
    *   This was made clear when EPIC came after Particle Health.
*   **Healthcare AI Needs Data**
    *   Every healthcare AI company is bottlenecked on training data. Identified health data is the scarcest data type at right now.
    *   For example, OpenAI wants to create a patient wallet but has no way to onboard the patient's records.
*   **AI Automates Labor**
    *   AI can transform labor into software. For example, authorization validation, facility matching, follow ups, ect...
    *   Converting labor into software enables us to build a saas business instead of a traditional services business like past networks.
*   **The Shift to Identified Data**
    *   The de-identified data market is mature and commoditized, prompting data sources to explore monetization for identified health data. Early APIs from Epic, Veradigm, MRO, and others are unlocking programmatic data access.

## Slide 22: The Team

**The Team**

**Alejandro Zamorano**
CEO & Founder
I've spent the last 15 years at the ground floor of building the rails for health data movement at Datavant, PainQx, and Life Science Nation.
I understand data movement and the ecosystem.
I recruited operators who've built under constraints – security clearances, compliance mandates, and messy data. Healthcare data infrastructure requires the same muscle.

## Slide 3: The OnRamp for Identified Health Data

**The OnRamp for Identified Health Data**

Hermes Health is a neutral middleware platform that simplifies and streamlines access to identified patient health data for non-treatment use cases (legal, insurance, health plans, life sciences)

**Quick Facts**

| Founded              | March 2025        |
| :------------------- | :---------------- |
| Team                 | 4                 |
| Monthly Active Users | 46                |
| Customers            | 5                 |
| Annualized Revenue   | $127,000 (Dec * 12) |
| Site Sonar Volume    | 496 (90% Completion) |

**What We Do**
Validate → Discover → Route → Deliver

**Hermes Console + UI (Screenshot description):**
The screenshot displays a dashboard for "Company Name" with navigation for "PROJECTS", "PATIENTS", "SITES", "RECORD REQUESTS", "USER", and "ADMIN".

The main dashboard section shows:
*   **Projects:** 2010
*   **Record Requests:** 205
*   **Unique Patients:** 3075 (Based on name and date of birth)

A "Status Distribution" section presents a donut chart and a breakdown:

**Status Category Breakdown**

| Category        | Count | Percentage |
| :-------------- | :---- | :--------- |
| Completed       | 101   | 49%        |
| Processing      | 40    | 20%        |
| Pending         | 9     | 4%         |
| Need resolution | 32    | 16%        |
| Cancelled       | 23    | 11%        |
| **Total**       | **205** | **100%**     |

## Slide 4: The Problem

**The Problem**

Getting a complete medical record is still a 60-day, $100+ manual process with a ~15% failure.

*   **Fragmented**
    Varying channels to get medical records (fax, bespoke requestor portals, and limited APIs).
*   **Laborious**
    $100+ fully-loaded cost per record request (request labor + site fees).
*   **Slow**
    p90 60 days: Fax → follow-up → invoice → resend auth → record retrieved
*   **High Failure Rate**
    Records get rejected about 15% of the time due to wrong facility, missing authorization information, incomplete records
*   **Complicated by Regulations**
    TEFCA/HIEs can only serve treatment data exchange; non-treatment use cases cannot use them.

| Use Case Purpose            | Hermes | TEFCA + HIES |
| :-------------------------- | :----- | :----------- |
| Treatment                   | ✗      | ✓            |
| Legal (PI/Mass Tort)        | ✓      | ✗            |
| Life Insurance Underwriting | ✓      | ✗            |
| Health Plan Ops/Payment     | ✓      | ✗            |
| Clinical Research           | ✓      | ✗            |

## Slide 5: The Market: Non-Treatment Use Cases

**The Market: Non-Treatment Use Cases**

145M record requests a year equals a $10B annual spend category begging for disruption.

**Annual Spend**

| Customer Type                          | Record Requests | Cost Per Record (Labor + Site Fees) |
| :------------------------------------- | :-------------- | :---------------------------------- |
| Attorneys (Mass Tort and Personal Injury) | 25M             | $100                                |
| Insurance (Life, Disability, Car, Workers) | 15M             | $100                                |
| Government                             | 1M              | $100                                |
| Life Science Companies                 | 4.5M            | $200                                |
| Health Plans                           | 100M            | $50                                 |
| **TOTAL**                              | **145,500,000** |                                     |

*   **TAM** $10B Non Treatment Use Cases Annual Spend
*   **Focus Today** $4B Law Firms + Insurance
*   **2026** $5B Health Plans
*   **2027** $1B Government + Life Sciences

Number of Requests per Year * $100 (Retrieval + Site Fees)
× ~20% Hermes Take Rate = $2.5B

## Slide 7: Solution: Hermes Network

**Solution: Hermes Network**

Requestors integrate once with Hermes and instantly get compliant access to health data across many sources

**One Network. One Workflow. One API.**

*   **Inputs**
    Patient auth + patient identifiers + request type
*   **Hermes Middleware**
    Authorization validation + route optimization
    routing to best source + audit trail
*   **Outputs**
    Record delivered + status + provenance + billing + audit trail
*   **Example**
    Legal case → submit auth to Hermes → facility matched → routed to ROI source → record delivered by ROI → law firm picks it up → customer invoiced

**Network Diagram:**

## Slide 8: From Network → Packaged Solutions

**From Network → Packaged Solutions**

We take our network and then build simple product wedges that compound into a platform as connectivity grows.

**Product Offerings & Launch Timeline:**

| Product/Solution      | Description                                     | Launch Status/Date |
| :-------------------- | :---------------------------------------------- | :----------------- |
| **Hermes Console + API** | Request and Receive Data                        | Live Today         |
| **Site Sonar**        | Find Facilities Where the Patient has visited   | Live Today         |
| **Patient Histories** | Find RX, Diagnosis, and Procedures for a Patient | Q1 2026 Launch     |
| **Fast Lane (ROI)**   | Retrieve Full Medical Records                   | Q1 2026 Launch     |
| **Fast Lane (EHR)**   | Retrieve Full Medical Records                   | Q2 2026 Launch     |

## Slide 9: Business Model

**Business Model**

We monetize the requestors with simple usage pricing

**Business Model**
*   Hermes monetizes the Requestors.
*   Hermes pays the Data Source
*   Gross margin is the spread between what we charge Requestors and what Data Source charge us.
*   Gross Margin expands as our network grows

**Pricing and Gross Margin**

| Category          | Price                       | Gross Margin |
| :---------------- | :-------------------------- | :----------- |
| Site Sonar        | $15 Per Patient             | 66%          |
| Patient Histories | $50 Per Patient             | 50%          |
| Fast Lane - ROI   | $5 Per Record (+ Facility Fees) | 80%          |
| Fast Lane - EHR   | $50 Per Record              | 50%          |

**Example**
Retrieval firm pays us $15,000 a month
1,000 Site Sonar Requests @ $15 each

## Slide 10: Wedge: Site Sonar

**Wedge: Site Sonar**

Site Sonar solves the first major bottleneck – finding where a patient was treated – it's a major hit

**1st Product:** Site Sonar

**1st Target Market:** Record Retrieval Companies

*   **Problem**
    Patients don't remember where they have been treated.
*   **Medical Canvassing**
    Today the solution is "Medical Canvassing" where they call providers and ask them if the patient has been treated at the facility (seriously).
*   **Site Sonar**
    Site Sonar uses claims data – returning the locations where patients have been treated in 12 hours with zero manual effort.
    *   90% Hit Rate
    *   76% of all Claims Encounters
    *   2017 to Present

*   **Record Retrieval Companies**
    Law Firms and Insurance Companies outsource 50% of their request to Record Retrieval companies. The market includes 100+ vendors.
    High density of requests making them perfect to kick off the network

**Cumulative Site Sonar Patients (Line Graph Data, approximate points based on visual inspection):**

*   **Mar 30:** ~20 patients
*   **May 25:** ~100 patients
*   **Oct 12:** ~150 patients
*   **Oct 26:** ~200 patients
*   **Nov 9:** ~300 patients
*   **Nov 23:** ~400 patients
*   **Dec 7:** ~580 patients
*   **Dec 21, 2025:** Total Patients: 717, New this week: +133

## Slide 11: Site Sonar Kills "Medical Canvassing"

**Site Sonar Kills "Medical Canvassing"**

Site Sonar cuts facility discovery from 7 days and $425 per patient to —12 hours and $15 per patient.

**Site Sonar Benefits:**
*   Reduce Turnaround times
*   Less Cost
*   National Coverage
*   Simple User Experience
*   Secure & Compliant

**Comparison: In-House vs. After Hermes (Site Sonar)**

| Metric          | In-House | After Hermes |
| :-------------- | :------- | :----------- |
| Turnaround Time | 4-7 Days | 12 Hours     |
| Labor Time      | 20 Hours | 1 Minute     |
| Cost            | $425     | $15          |
| Coverage        | Regional | National     |
| Completeness    | 10%      | 76%          |

## Slide 13: AI Automation Replaces Labor

**AI Automation Replaces Labor**

We turn labor driven steps into automated workflows, enabling us to expand margin and scale without labor.

**Hermes AI Native Workflows**
*   **HIPAA Checker**
    Analyzes a patient authorization to make sure it meets the minimum criteria
*   **Site Finder**
    Facility lookup tool that matches a given site name and address to existing sites in our database, returning results with confidence scores based on the AI's judgment.
*   **Site Researcher**
    Web research agent that automatically finds and validates a facilities contact information for: Medical Records, Billing, and Imaging/Radiology necessary to route record requests.

**AI Automation Comparison**

| Category      | Human Labor Time | Human Cost | Hermes AI Time | Hermes Cost |
| :------------ | :--------------- | :--------- | :------------- | :---------- |
| HIPAA Checker | 10 minutes       | $3         | 1 minute       | $0.15       |
| Site Finder   | 30 minutes       | $6         | 1 minute       | $0.20       |
| Site Researcher | 25 minutes       | $8         | 5 minutes      | $0.80       |

## Slide 14: Security & Compliance

**Security & Compliance**

We are handling identified PHI, so we've invested early in controls, audit trails, and SOC2-grade processes.

**Security & Compliance Milestones**
*   HIPAA Compliant Platform
*   SOC2 Type I: In Progress (Jan Target)
*   SOC2 Type II: In Progress (June Target)
*   Vanta Trust Center

(Graphic: Two overlapping shapes, one with "HIPAA" caduceus logo, the other with "SOC2" shield logo.)

## Slide 15: Neutrality Is our Superpower

**Neutrality Is our Superpower**

The winning network can't be requestor or a data source centric—only a neutral trusted broker can build a network at scale.

**Why Hermes Wins**
Hermes wins because neutrality is the only model where rival data sources and requestors will join.
That trust drives connection density, which compounds into a durable network moat

**The Hermes Promise**
*   No front running data sources
*   No selling routing intelligence
*   Honor data source use case rules

**Why Other Networks Have Failed**
*   **Health Information Exchanges**
    HIE's ONLY allow treatment use cases and generate little economic value for the EHRs that power them.
*   **The Datasource Centric Network**
    A datasource acts as the default network, creating conflicts by prioritizing its own data in the fulfillment flow.
*   **The Requestor Centric Network**
    A retrieval company acts as the network, but competitors won't join because it exposes their customer lists, and makes their competitor stronger.

## Slide 16: Alternative Identified Health Networks

**Alternative Identified Health Networks**

One connection to Hermes unlocks non-treatment case cases across a fragmented ecosystem

**Alternative Network Axis**
*   Treatment vs Non Treatment
*   Partial Footprint vs National Footprint

**Why Hermes Wins**
Hermes is the only network that can support non-treatment use cases through one connection that is not owned by a data source or requestor.

**Matrix: Treatment vs Non-Treatment Use Cases, National vs Partial Footprint**

|                             | **National Footprint**                                                                    | **Partial Footprint**                                                                                |

## Slide 18: The Flywheel & MOAT

**The Flywheel & MOAT**

Scaling the network and volume creates a self-reinforcing flywheel effect deepens the MOAT.

*   **Connection Density**
    Every new datasource reduces the need for customers to build bespoke integrations—and increases our routing success rate.
*   **Neutrality**
    We don't compete with data sources or customers, so adoption compounds across the ecosystem.
*   **Economies of Scale**
    Higher volume → lower datasource fees → lower customer cost → higher volume.
*   **Products Velocity**
    Shared workflow primitives let us ship improvements once and propagate them across every connection.

**Hermes Health Flywheel Effect Diagram:**

(Arrows represent a clockwise flow)
1.  More Data Available To Requestors
2.  More Requestors
3.  More Record Volume Equals more Revenue to Datasource
4.  More Data Sources join the Network

## Slide 19: Strategic Vision & Goals

**Strategic Vision & Goals**

The next phase is to use our momentum to scale our network and achieve escape velocity

**Phased Approach & Timeline**

| Phase               | Description                                                                                             | Target Year |
| :------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :---------- |
| **Phase 1: Relevance** | **Prove the Foundation**<br>Build a minimum viable network and product to prove requestor demand and data sources interest. | 2025        |
| **Phase 2: Ubiquity** | **Scale Network Density**<br>Sign up all the data sources to the network creating a network moat.         | 2026        |
| **Phase 3: Scale**  | **Scale the Volume**<br>Use the network to scale request volume and achieve breakout.                     | 2027        |
| **Phase 4: Monetize** | **Monetize & Move Up the Stack**<br>Use the request volume and network to build verticalized value added solutions. | 2028+       |

(A pointer indicates "We are Here" at Phase 1, 2025)

## Slide 20: Why Now

**Why Now**

5 forces are converging to create a one-in-decade window

*   **Neutral Networks Got Acquired**
    *   Chartswap sold to Ontellus (2019)
    *   Clareto sold to MIB (2025); both lost neutrality by selling
    *   A neutral rail does not exist today.
*   **TEFCA Excludes Non-Treatment Use Cases**
    *   HIE's and TEFCA serve treatment by design. Legal, insurance, life sciences use cases are locked out.
    *   This was made clear when EPIC came after Particle Health.
*   **Healthcare AI Needs Data**
    *   Every healthcare AI company is bottlenecked on training data. Identified health data is the scarcest data type at right now.
    *   For example, OpenAI wants to create a patient wallet but has no way to onboard the patient's records.
*   **AI Automates Labor**
    *   AI can transform labor into software. For example, authorization validation, facility matching, follow ups, ect...
    *   Converting labor into software enables us to build a saas business instead of a traditional services business like past networks.

**The Shift to Identified Data**
The de-identified data market is mature and commoditized, prompting data sources to explore monetization for identified health data. Early APIs from Epic, Veradigm, MRO, and others are unlocking programmatic data access.
