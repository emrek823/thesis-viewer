Oracle has 274 healthcare customers for its [clinical AI agent](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/healthcare-information-technology/innovation/oracle-ai-agent-excels-in-ehr-integration-klas/), a number that “continues to rise daily,” the company said.

The software giant touted its healthcare offerings during a Dec. 10 [earnings call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/12/10/oracle-orcl-q2-2026-earnings-call-transcript/), also pointing to its AI-powered ambulatory EHR [gaining](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/healthcare-information-technology/ehrs/oracle-healths-new-ehr-now-ready-for-adoption/) regulatory approval.

“The go-lives for these clinical AI agents … a new breed of \[software as a service\] applications for us, are measured in a matter of weeks,” Oracle CEO [Mike Sicilia](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/healthcare-information-technology/ehrs/oracle-health-reports-to-new-oracle-ceo/) said in the call. “So you’re looking at an industry like healthcare, where it would take months or years to get anything done at that magnitude: weeks. And by the way, the customers are implementing these things all by themselves. They don’t need us to help them. You just roll them out, and they work.”

Brentwood, Tenn.-based Lifepoint Health, a 60-plus hospital system, also recently went live on its third wave of Oracle’s Fusion enterprise resource planning system for supply chain and human capital management, Mr. Sicilia said.
