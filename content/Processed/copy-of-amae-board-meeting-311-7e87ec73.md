## Slide 3: Key Updates Since Series A
### Key Updates Since Series A
* **Ohio State Medical Center PSA:** OSUMC agreed to work on a PSA with us to open a clinic in 2024. We have kicked off a working group – this would be Amae's first health system PSA.
* **New York Presbyterian Referral Partnership:** We have signed a referral partnership agreement with New York Presbyterian. This is the first health system referral partnership we have signed and will anchor us in NYC.
* **Magellan Value-Based Care Agreement:** We have agreed to terms with Magellan on a case rate, it would be $32k per year. This will allow us to significantly increase our in-network coverage for California (in LA or any other clinic we open).
* **Leadership Hiring:** Hired Amy Finney as COO (referral from Amir Rubin) to join in mid-April to be an experienced clinical operations leader for the organization.
* **Strategic Investment:** While not finalized, all signs point to CommonSpirit investing $1M into Amae's Series A, with significant interest for larger future investment. CommonSpirit has >170 hospitals throughout the U.S. and can be a significant anchor referral partner / PSA partner.

## Slide 5: State of the Product: EHR Selection
### State of the Product: EHR Selection
**Recommendation:** Select HiMS as a short/medium term EHR, but continue to evaluate a longer term relationship with Cerner based on HiMS observed experience in the coming 10-12 months.

|                          | HiMS Axiom [Our Selection]                                                                        | Cerner                                                                                      | Kipu                                                                                              |
| :----------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Cost**                 | 37k implementation, 3.1k/month first clinic 5 full clinics – 250 providers = $270k / yr           | 172k implementation, 5.5k/month first clinic 5 full clinics – 250 provides = $300k / yr     | 10k implementation, $40 per patient / month model (1.5k/month first clinic)                       |
| **Implementation Timeline** | 6-8 weeks                                                                                         | 9+ months                                                                                   | Ambiguous, but 8-12 weeks                                                                         |
| **Feature Completeness and Flexibility** | Psych + PCP + Wrap-around care support Most flexibility in creating and customizing treatment plans and notes | Psych + PCP + Wrap-around care support Flexible but requires Cerner eng to make a wide array of changes | Psych support Least flexible for customization and narrowest future set due to target demographic |
| **Integration and Support for Standards** | Federal interoperability mandate compliant. FHIR USCDIvl and others available for free read and write | Federal interoperability mandate compliant. FHIR USCDIv1 reads available for free and others available for added charge | Not FHIR enabled yet. Also not a meaningful use certified EHR.                                      |
| **Clinical Decision Support (CDS) and Med Management** | HIMS enables CDS through Medispan. All templates are alterable. Med mgmt available through surescripts | CDS enabled, but template alterations seem less flexible without intervention. Same med mgmt functionality as HiMS | No CDS, limited med management through a partnership with DrFirst that's in beta (current offering is being deprecated) |
| **Insurance Management** | Full insurance look up & EV/BV functionality (eligibility verification, benefits verification)      | Full insurance look up & EV/BV functionality                                                | No insurance lookups, but has EV/BV functionality                                                 |

## Slide 6: State of the Product: Summary
### State of the Product: Summary
* **EHR Selection:** Recommendation: Select HiMS as a short/medium term EHR, but continue to evaluate a longer term relationship with Cerner based on HiMS observed experience in the coming 10-12 months.
* **Clinical Decision Support:** After stabilizing EHR implementation in NC, we will evaluate a framework for enabling better clinical decision support for our team (ie: operationalizing the Amae Institute). We envision doing this directly through Palantir Foundry
    * We've signed a contract with Palantir Foundry to be our business intelligence and data software. We received a very favorable price of $100k for 15months, and $100k per year pricing thereafter locked in for 5 years (renewal every year)
* **RCM:** Evaluating RCM offering through our leading contender for EHR software, HiMS. Backdoor referrals of a clinic with 140M ARR that uses HiMS RCM stated 98% claims paid first time. Fully US Based team.

## Slide 22: Strategic Priorities/Additional Deep Dives
### Strategic Priorities/Additional Deep Dives
*   **Market selection & launch timelines**
    *   How should we space out clinic launches?
    *   What's the right length of lease to sign for our clinics?
        *   LA is 3 year, that has been the target so far
*   **Should we look at Santa Clara / San Mateo or another commercial market in California as we have very good commercial contracts in California?**
    *   Stanford; Sutter; CommonSpirit (not many hospitals in South Bay); Kaiser?
*   **Setting up Palantir for data collection and PMS system**
    *   Should we hire a consulting firm for Palantir implementation? Or would it be better to hire an ex-Palantir engineer full-time?
*   **Mass General**
    *   Potential partnership for Amae Institute - will immensely help with PR as well
    *   Rippl Academy; InStride Health are examples of what this will look like
*   **Hospitality focus in clinics**
    *   Bere Olomedo to start consulting with us ~10 hours / week (depending upon Visa)

## Slide 24: Amae Health Core Values
### Amae Health Core Values
**1) Scrappy**
We are lean, agile, nimble, and aren't afraid of a challenge. We're results oriented, and do not accept the status-quo.
We're not bloated; we don't go with the obvious choice; we don't manage – we execute.

**2) Intentional**
We truly, actually care. We're authentic in putting care at the core, for our team, our members, and our mission.
We are not haphazard and we aren't indecisive. We don't make decisions too slowly or too quickly.

**3) Seize opportunity**
We attack the problem, climb the hill, go after our goals directly. We are action oriented, we don't take no for an answer.

**4) We take our work seriously, not ourselves**
We incorporate humor because it's important to balance out the grind and challenges. We make space for jokes, levity, laughter.
We dedicate our focus to the singular cause of severe mental illness (SMI), undistracted by concerns that are not ours to solve.

**5) Your job isn't done until the job is done**
We operate as a collective. We take ownership. We look to help one another to get to the goal.
