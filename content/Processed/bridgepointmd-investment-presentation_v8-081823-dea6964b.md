## Slide 4: The Problems

### The Problems
Specialist physicians are on the outside, looking in

1.  Specialists have built their infrastructure around fee-for-service
2.  Difficult to engage physician group practices or single out high performing physicians
3.  Specialists are typically not well suited or prepared to succeed in value-based care models
4.  Specialists lack access to price transparency & predictive analytics to succeed in value-based contracting.

An experienced support solution using technology-enabled processes can bring specialist physicians on par with the evolving healthcare landscape

## Slide 5: The Solution

### The Solution
Simplifying Value-Based Care to engage Specialists

*   Aligning high performing physicians to VBC contracts and aligning physician incentives to quality improvement and cost reductions
*   Simplify contracting for payers with specialist. A single point of contact.
*   Increase revenue to physicians while maintaining autonomy and culture of the physician practice
*   Tech enablement provides analytics, care navigation, efficiency, automation to support physicians in VBC

## Slide 6: Align Physicians to Appropriate Models

### Align Physicians to Appropriate Models

**Practice Types:**
*   ENT Practice: 10 Physicians
*   GI Practice: 10 Physicians
*   MSK Practice: 20 Physicians

**BridgepointMD**

**Contract Models:**
*   **Direct to Employer**
    *   8 ENT, 10 GI, & 12 MSK Physicians
*   **ACO Contract**
    *   8 ENT, 6 GI, & 12 MSK Physicians
*   **MA Risk Contract**
    *   2 ENT, 4 GI, & 8 MSK Physicians

*   Not all practice physicians will engage in each contract/model
*   Physician alignment to contract/model structure is key to success
*   Predictive data analytics drives engagement decision making

## Slide 7: Business Model

### Business Model

**Episode Finances**

| Metric                  | Value  |
| :---------------------- | :----- |
| Baseline Target Cost    | 25000  |
| Episode Cost (actual)   | 21000  |
| Savings (revenue)       | $4000  |

**Business Model Flow:**
1.  PGP 1, PGP 2, PGP 3 (Physician Group Practices with individual physicians, some selected for VBP)
2.  Payer
3.  Episode Initiating PGP (New EIN/TIN)
4.  Savings generated
5.  Savings distribution

**Distribution Example**

*   Total Savings (revenue): $4,000
*   BPMD: $1,400 (35% rev. model)
    *   $700 Income
    *   $700 OpEx
*   PGP: $2,600
    *   $1,300 to Practice
    *   $1,300 to Physician

1.  Predictive data analytics select specialists (green) from each PGP to participate in a designated VBP high-performance EIN/TIN
2.  Limited clinical or administrative workflow disruption required – keep doing what you're doing
3.  Exclude physicians based on historic performance analytics or lack of desire to engage in VBC model
4.  Add additional physicians based on improved high-performance metrics & motivation to engage in VBC model
