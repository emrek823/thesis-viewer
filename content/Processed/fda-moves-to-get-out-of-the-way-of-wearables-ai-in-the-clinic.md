At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, FDA Commissioner Marty Makary, MD, MPH, announced that his agency issued two new guidance documents aimed at easing regulation of digital health products.

Both guidance documents "will promote more innovation with AI [artificial intelligence] and medical devices," Makary said in a video from the floor of the show that he posted on X

One document deals with "general wellness" products

, which are often referred to as "wearables," and the other pertains to clinical decision support software

used by clinicians.

The wearables guidance covers products like smart watches, smart rings, and other sensors that track various health parameters. Makary spoke of these products' "profound ability to identify early physiologic changes, screen for diseases, and help people in their quest to be healthier."

According to the updated guidance, products can qualify as general wellness as long as they don't make claims about treating or preventing a certain disease. They can, however, state that they can help promote or maintain a healthy weight, for instance, or promote relaxation or manage stress.

"So, you can say this product helps people with anxiety lead healthier lives," he added. "They increased the scope a little bit."

Torous noted that over the summer, a company called WHOOP received an FDA warning letter

over a product that could measure and track blood pressure. While the FDA told the company the product is a device, the company pushed back, including in a press release on its website

"I think under this new guidance, [WHOOP's blood pressure tracker] would be allowed," Torous said. Indeed, in the guidance document, the agency states that it "may consider certain products that use non-invasive sensing (e.g., optical sensing) to estimate, infer, or output physiologic parameters (e.g., blood pressure, oxygen saturation, blood glucose, heart rate variability) to be general wellness products."

The wearables guidance was last updated in 2019, and was "due for an update because the technology has changed," Torous said.

The clinical decision support software guidance was last updated in 2022, and mainly deals with how technology can help clinicians make healthcare decisions.

"For a lot of the decision support out there, we need to get out of the way as a regulator," Makary said in his video. "We have a clear lane for medical-grade products, but otherwise we need to adapt with the times and be proactive with guidance so that companies and developers are not left confused about what they should be doing or what the FDA wants."

Examples from the document include technology that provides a list of diagnosis and treatment options based on clinical guidelines, recommends prescription drugs based on FDA labeling, or identifies drug-drug interactions.

"Some may say this is just opening up healthcare to AI," Torous said. "And there are valid concerns that AI may not be ready for clinical care."

On the other hand, he noted, the guidance "reflects the times of what the technology can do and, often, how people are using it. At this point, I think we have to accept that that's the direction the field is going."

Nonetheless, it's still unclear as to "how it will all shake out, because half of regulation is how it's enforced," Torous added.

He said the move fits in with the overall push by HHS in favor of wearable digital health devices, AI, and other technology. Last month, for instance, CMS and FDA announced programs that will make it easier for physicians to incorporate wearables and other technology into practice.

CMS' ACCESS program

champions the use of these devices as part of an overall plan to improve health outcomes, while FDA's TEMPO program

aims to take a "risk-based enforcement approach" to digital health devices for certain conditions.

"The burden will be on the companies to show their product will work," he added.
