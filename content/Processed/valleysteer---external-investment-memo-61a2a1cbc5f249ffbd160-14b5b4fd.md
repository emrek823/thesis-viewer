## Executive Summary
Valley Steer ("VS") is building an ultra low-cost billing service for PCPs that clinically reviews patient charts for risk adjustment and quality measures before any claim is generated.

VS utilizes proprietary offshore clinical talent in Indonesia and sophisticated internal tooling to generate clean claims with appropriate clinical context for risk adjustment and quality measures. These tech-enabled services will become commoditized over time so VS offers them today at an 80% discount, in a extremely price elastic market, to take market share from incumbents who are unwilling and unable to cannibalize their current cash cows. The company's current focus is on staying breakeven and building operational and technical infrastructure to develop sophisticated analytics (starting with payment acceleration) over the next 2-3 years that will drive profitability over the long-term.

The current $100B+ revenue-cycle management (RCM) market, particularly payment integrity and claims editing on the payer back-end, is warped by misaligned incentives and dominated by antiquated incumbents. The rise of value-based care (VBC) is creating additional complexity for payers and providers because risk adjustment requires sophisticated statistical analyses and additional data collection. Payment acceleration, VS' first analytics product on its roadmap, is one of the few solutions that aligns incentives for payers looking for high-quality PCPs in a supply-constrained environment and cash strapped PCPs. Policy changes around risk adjustment and the lack of true payment acceleration solutions for VBC today create a massive opportunity for VS to partner with these managed care organizations at this important inflection point.

VS is currently working with Apollo Medical ($AMEH), a risk-bearing PCP group with $880M in capitated revenue and 1.3M members. The company's early success with $AMEH provides strong initial validation and a foundation for scale to other managed care organizations. VS can generate $5M+ in annual revenue from Apollo alone over the next 2-3 years, with an additional $3M in potential annual revenue per new client (other risk-bearing entities & MSOs) during that same timeframe.

Startups typically don't focus on payer infrastructure without raising tens of millions in outside financing because it's expensive to build these systems and teams. VS has taken a deliberate, capital-efficient approach to get its technical and operational infrastructure in place before raising a large round (~$20M) in 2-3 years to drive profitability with its payment acceleration product. This strategy provides a durable advantage because competing would require incumbents who are not tech savvy to cannibalize their profits in order to compete with VS. The current market climate has allowed Virtue to negotiate a valuation cap ($25M post) that represents a material discount (>50%) to a Series A financing which Valley Steer could have raised had management chosen to and which has been reiterated to Virtue by multiple, reputable market sources. We are excited to back VS to help them unlock massive value with payment acceleration.

## Team
Co-founders Gerald Zhou and Nick Johnson first worked together a decade ago at Sirono, a startup Gerald co-founded originally focused on patient payments. Since then, they have both developed complementary expertise on the business and operational side (Gerald) and with sophisticated ML techniques at-scale (Nick). Although they worked within different organizations at Clover during their time there, they have stayed close friends over the years and have a well-developed understanding of how to work effectively together - a characteristic we highly value in co-founders

*   **Gerald Zhou** - Electrical and computer engineering major from Carnegie Mellon whose first foray into healthcare was founding Sirono, a startup focused on patient payments. After 5 years at Sirono, Gerald cut his teeth in managed care for 4 years at Clover during a formative time for company growth ahead of Clover's $35M Series B in 2015. He left in 2019 after becoming head of corporate development and playing a pivotal role in helping the company scale its product offering and raise its Series D ($1.1B valuation). In 2019, he started OneKlinik, the Carbon Health of Indonesia. The unique access to clinical labor from OneKlinik and experience in managed care led him to create what VS has become today.
*   **Nick Johnson** - Nick is a computer scientist in the truest sense of the word, coding and tearing apart from computers from a young age before taking on a number of different programming roles after graduating from UT Austin. After leaving Sirono as CTO in 2015, he formed Character Biosciences, Clover Health's therapeutic development arm to utilize Clover's vast amount of clinical data to generate drug targets.

## Generating a Claim and Getting Paid: $100B+ Market Increasing in Complexity
The US healthcare spend of over >$4T is largely driven by healthcare services, with spending on hospital (31%) and physician services (20%) representing a majority of this spend. The US spends 2%-3% of all healthcare dollars on the revenue cycle management (RCM) process, which involves all the steps of getting providers paid and helping payers ensure accuracy of claims.

**Generating a Claim:** For professional claims (e.g., claims for outpatient physicians vs. inpatient), providers can submit a claim through a variety of manual to automated processes. We focus on professional claims given VS's focus on PCPs as the unit of care. The below processes are from most manual to most automated.
1.  Paper CMS-1500 claim submitted by "snail mail"
2.  Electronic CMS-1500 claim digitally submitted as PDF
3.  Electronic CMS-1500 claim digitally submitted as XML
4.  ASC X12 837P digitally submitted as EDI transaction set
5.  Da Vinci Payer Data Exchange (FHIR)

Providers use submission of electronic (XML-based) CMS-1500 claims vs. only supporting 837P in a lot of cases because those claims are easier to generate.

**Example: CMS-1500 to EDI Conversion**
*(Image displays a side-by-side comparison. On the left, a scanned or digital image of a CMS-1500 form with various fields, dates, diagnosis codes, procedure codes, and charges. On the right, a structured digital interface showing extracted data fields like "24b 1:Place Of Service", "24c_1:Emg", "24d_1:Code", "24d_1:Modifier1" with their corresponding values (e.g., "41", "X", "A0427", "SH!"). This illustrates the conversion of a paper-based claim form into a digital, structured format suitable for electronic data interchange.)*

**Payment Integrity and Claims Editing Market:** Given ValleySteer's current positioning, we focus on the specific $30B - $35B payment integrity (PI) and claims editing (CE) market comprising a payer's back-end infrastructure. This market is dominated by legacy vendors built on antiquated technology cobbled together over decades of acquisitions. Large payers will typically have multiple utilization management vendors, one primary CE vendor, one secondary CE vendor, and 3-5 PI vendors across pre-pay and post-pay. These incumbents generate ~30-40% EBITDA margins across CE/PI, with positive working capital dynamics and limited CapEx, leading to FCF margins that are ~80-100% of EBITDA.

**Payment Integrity and Claims Editing Market: 2023**

| Capabilities              | Utilization Management | Clearinghouse   | Primary Claims Editing | Secondary Claims Editing | Pre-pay Payment Integrity | Post-pay Payment Integrity |
| :------------------------ | :--------------------- | :-------------- | :--------------------- | :----------------------- | :------------------------ | :------------------------- |

| **Business Model**        | PMPY                   | Per submission  | PMPY                   | PMPY                     | 20% revenue share         | 20% revenue share          |

*   **Utilization management (UM):** UM vendors set medical policies for what services are allowed and put prior authorization rules in place to collect data to confirm medical treatment is appropriate. Utilization management is a blunt tool payers use to increase friction and deny claims, and a major source of burnout for providers. Evicore, the largest player in the space with 30% market share, was acquired by Express Scripts for $3.6B in 2017.
*   **Clearinghouse:** Providers use clearinghouses as a network to send claims to many different payers. They utilize these networks to make it easier to send claims to multiple payers and as a 3rd-party arbiter of trust between the payer and provider. The market has seen rapid change following $UHG's $13B acquisition of Change Healthcare, the largest clearinghouse in the country with 60%-70% market share.
*   **Primary claims editing:** There are universal or standard claim edits such as National Correct Coding Initiative (NCCI) Edits, Global Edits, and Correct Coding or ICD-10-CM Edits performed during the primary claims edit. ClaimsXten, which TPG recently acquired from Change for $2.2B so United could avoid antitrust lawsuits, has 50% market share. Optum, a subsidiary of $UHG, currently has 40% market share.
*   **Secondary claims editing:** The universal standards mentioned above do not cover all requirements, and the secondary claims editing process includes customized payer, specialty, provider, or location-specific edits. Cotiviti, which has solutions across payment integrity as well, is in talks for a $15B deal with Carlyle.
*   **Pre-pay payment integrity:** Payment integrity is shifting more to pre-pay. 5-10 years ago, pre-pay was virtually non-existent. Today, the split of savings for payment integrity is 40% pre-pay / 60% post-pay, with pre-pay share expected to grow rapidly.
*   **Post-pay payment integrity:** Most of the market is moving away from post-pay due to provider friction caused from "pay & chase". Dispute and appeals periods commonly range from 30 to 90 days and often involve extensive correspondence and accounts receivable work.

**Why is all of this necessary?** If a provider can generate a claim with an EMR and a billing solution, that provider can theoretically submit claims through the mail or payer portals. The original reason providers used Change or claimsXten is to ensure they submit the right claim, to the right payer, at the right time, so their claim is approved and paid on time. The space has evolved into a cash-extraction business for large, pseudo-monopolies for 2 main reasons:
1.  **Trust:** Providers feel if they give up control of their valuable clinical data that they will be taken advantage of by payers who control the purse and will seek every opportunity to deny a claim. This dynamic is the source of inherent friction between providers and payers that has been evolving over decades. Clearinghouses were originally supposed to serve as 3rd-party arbiters of trust between providers and payers, but their role has morphed over time because of perverse incentives.
2.  **Incentives:** As payers gain more power and vertically integrate, the balance of power continues to move towards the payers. Payers have responded to fraud, waste, and abuse (FWA) from providers with layers of claims editing and payment integrity solutions. Over time, they have continued to outsource these functions to 3rd-party vendors. Over the last two decades, these vendors have turned into behemoths generating massive profits with no incentive to disrupt their current business model.

**Risk Adjustment in VBC - Adding More Complexity:** VBC models look to change incentives by paying providers a bundled or capitated rate based on quality and outcomes vs. optimizing for documentation of CPT codes in a FFS world. VBC models create additional complexity because of sophisticated statistical analyses and additional data collection to appropriately risk adjust patients that require a broader set of clinical documentation.

**Healthcare Analytics and Reporting Required for Risk Adjustment (ACIS Solutions 2021)**
*(Image displays a process flow diagram with the following key components and flows:)*
*   **PROVIDER** submits Medical Claims, Pharma, Lab Reports, and Medical Records.
*   These flow into **HEALTH PLAN** Data Load Processes (Medicare Records, Pharma Rx, Medical Claims, Lab Results, Provider Data, Enrollment Data).
*   Data Load Processes feed into **Advanced Analytics** (Members with Gap in Care, Members Gap in documentation, Member Risk Score Calculations).
*   Advanced Analytics generates RAPS Submission Files and EDI 837 Files.
*   **Data Quality Checks** and **Suspect & Chart Chase List** are also part of the Health Plan process, with **Save into Data Warehouse** and **Supplemental Data**.
*   Submission Files Generation (from Advanced Analytics) and Supplemental Data feed into **CMS**.
*   **CMS** includes the RISK ADJUSTMENT PROCESSING SYSTEM (RAPS) and ENCOUNTER DATA PROCESSING SYSTEM (EDPS).
*   The final step shown is "Load RAPS and EDPS (999, 277, MA0001, MAO002, and MAO004) Responses".

Risk adjustment has a major impact on payment (see the 3.5x increase in payment below). In risk adjustment, diagnosis codes are assigned to hierarchical condition categories (HCCs) (e.g., diabetes, COPD, CHF), and each HCC has a coefficient that represents that disease's incremental contribution to overall costs. The average capitated rate for an MA member in 2022 was ~$15K, for example. Without risk-adjustment, health plans and providers would have no incentive to care for potentially high-cost patients and lead to adverse selection and unbalanced risk pools. At the same time, increasing political attention to its flaws and overpayments have the potential to redefine how payers approach risk adjustment.

Financial Impact of Appropriate HCC Coding (Health Catalyst 2019)

## ValleySteer Offering: Tech-enabled Services as a Wedge
VS is building tech-enabled services at ultra-low cost leveraging offshore labor and internal tooling to build integrations and collect data in order to lay the foundation for sophisticated analytics. VS is able to offer these services at such a low cost because of their unique access to offshore clinical labor and GTM strategy of utilizing these services as a loss leader to cannibalize incumbent offering and drive profitability from analytics. The market today is viewed as commoditized and is extremely price elastic, so customers are willing to switch immediately for cheaper services. This strategy provides a durable advantage because competing would require incumbents who are not tech savvy to cannibalize their profits to cross the chasm to compete with VS.

**Data Refinement Process:** The first step in understanding this approach is to compare the data refinement process today with VS' future vision. We view VS as building an oil refinery. There is the volume of different types of crude (light/sweet to heavy/sour), which would be equivalent to inpatient / outpatient charts, CMS-1500's (outpatient paper claims or PDFs), UB04's (inpatient paper claims or PDFs), and 837 institutional and professional codes (EDI). There are also multiple steps in the refining process (separation, conversion, treatment, etc), where VS is turning paper to electronic, misdirecting claims, performing clearinghouse functions, finding suspected ICD's, coding, and billing. The different types of crude requires different refining processes and produces different types of products.

**Data Refinement Process - Today vs. Valley Steer's Vision**

ValleySteer Materials (2023)

As shown above, the process today costs ~$75 and is often conducted retrospectively 12-18 months after the date of service. VS, on the other hand, is building the infrastructure to provide this service for $16-$17 (20% of the cost) by leveraging ML and tech enabled clinicians they employ in Indonesia to extract / abstract charts. VS generates a claim and concurrently reviews a chart, so diagnoses from the same year can be used to predict costs and pay provider in that same year.

**Tech-enabled Service Infrastructure:** VS is deliberately building key tech-enabled services for payers at a much lower cost basis than incumbents to dogfood product development, collect data to better underwrite risk, and establish beachheads in risk-bearing entities. The 3 main products VS has built today are the building blocks to accomplish the vision mentioned above.

**VS Current Tech-enabled Services Offering (2022)**
*(Image displays a diagram illustrating three core components: Redbird, Magneto, and Jubilee, and their interaction in the data processing flow.)*
*   **Redbird:** Processes Inbound Data, specifically Claim: CMS-1500, UB04; Dispute / Appeal; Pre-Authorization; Enrollment; Patient Chart. This feeds into "Valley Steer" at point (1).
*   **Magneto:** Part of the "Valley Steer" system, processing data. From "Valley Steer" (2), data flows to "Payer Internal Systems", which then routes to "External Destination" (3).
*   **Jubilee:** Connects from "Valley Steer" to "Data Elements Extracted".
*   **Data Elements Extracted** include: Member Details, Provider Details, Dates of Service, Places of Service, Suspected Diagnosis, HCC's, Quality Gaps.

*   **Redbird:** ML assisted paper form OCR extraction service from variety of data sources claims (CMS-1500, UB04, PA, enrollment, charts, etc).
*   **Magneto:** Electronic claims aggregation, modification, and misdirects. It (1) takes content that should be rejected and sent back to provider or health plan, (2) allows clean content to flow directly to payer's internal systems and workflows, and (3) routes content that doesn't need to go through the ops process to its destination.
*   **Jubilee:** Structuring, abstracting, and extracting of patient charts that is optimized for concurrent coding. VS is the only chart abstraction company the leverages GPs for chart review, while others use non-practitioners with nursing degrees.

**Clinical Labor Supply:** Many companies in healthcare use offshore labor to perform administrative tasks, but VS has a unique advantage. In late 2019, Gerald founded a company building the Carbon Health of Indonesia (OneKlinik). Indonesia is a country with the 4th highest population and their medical doctors are required to pass an English exam so they are able to read and write English. It is extremely difficult to pay clinical labor via PayPal remotely because GP's in Indonesia are very hesitant to try anything new so VS employs them directly. Because of this relationship, VS charges less than $3k per GP for chart review, which is equivalent to what Shearwater charges for non-clinician nurses in the Philippines. Utilizing GPs vs. non-clinician nurses improves efficiency and sensitivity / specificity in analyzing charts.

## Apollo - Initial Proving Ground:
VS' first customer is Apollo Medical ($AMEH), one of the largest managed care organizations in the country with 1.3M members in VBC across Medicare, Medicaid, commercial and $880M in capitated revenue in 2022. VS has launched infrastructure to concurrently review and code patient charts as well as generate clinically data rich claims. The platform is built in a way that allows VS to cleanly integrate with existing and future systems that ApolloMed decides to integrate within their clinics or MSO operations. These technical building blocks combined with the ability to scale a low-cost operations team allows VS to provide $AMEH with the only automated billing service that is systems agnostic and allows for concurrent coding.

VS Presentation to ApolloMed (2023)

VS' approach to the Apollo relationship provides an ideal foundation to scale to the next 3, 5, and 10 customers. First and most importantly, we have never seen a company at this early stage re-wire critical infrastructure for a $2B market cap company such as Apollo. This commitment and investment from Apollo is a testament to their trust in the management team and the services VS has built. Apollo is respected as a leader across the managed care landscape and provides strong early validation of the quality of VS' services as a case study for future customers. In addition, Apollo contracts with payers across the country and VS can use this beachhead to expand to those payer partners. While the exact services VS will provide may evolve from customer to customer, the technical and operational building blocks VS is deliberately building give them the opportunity for massive scale.

**Early Data with Clever Care Health Plan (CCHP):** VS' 2nd customer is CCHP, a 11k member regional MA plan. Early data with CCHP shows that initial chart reviews identified 25% of additional ICD findings, >10% additional chronic conditions, and 5-10% additional HCCs for members. VS is focused on its product development with Apollo this year given Apollo's massive scale, but will look to expand within CCHP over 2023 and 2024.

**Payment Acceleration:** We expect VS' payment acceleration product to go live over the next 2-3 years. VS' goal is to commoditize the infrastructure services that are the cash cows for incumbents and drive profitability from their analytics business, starting with payment acceleration. The initial hypothesis is that payment acceleration will bring the most value to the company as it provides massive value to both payers AND providers. In today's world, there is massive friction between payers and providers that often engage in a zero-sum game where providers fight to get paid more and payers fight to pay deny claims and pay less. Payment acceleration is a unique offering in that it is beneficial for both sides.

When we discuss payment acceleration in a VS context, we are NOT referring to the $25, $75, $150 bonuses once a year that some payers provide (see below). Other companies can accelerate FFS payments (e.g. Emdeon/Clover) and others can accelerate quality payments (e.g. Stellar/Vytalize), but no one can accelerate risk adjustment payments yet.

**Annual Care Visit Bonuses (UHG Providers, 2023)**
*   **ACV Bonus:** $25 for each qualifying ACV you conduct
*   **High-priority ACV Bonus:** Up to $150 for each ACV you conduct for a high-priority member identified in the Patient Care Opportunity Report (PCOR)
*   **ACV Quality Bonus:** An additional $75 bonus annually for each ACV you complete if you achieve a year-end Average Star Rating of 4.00 or higher

## Value of Risk-adjusted Payment Acceleration: Putting PCPs at the Center
**Engaged PCPs are the Main Lever for VBC Growth:** Plans need high-quality providers to help drive risk-adjustment and cost-savings initiatives, but are supply-constrained in today's environment. Providers are historically cash-strapped and want to increase revenue in value-based care models, but struggle to commit to the upfront investment needed when payments are delayed, complex, and uncertain. Risk-adjusted payment acceleration, not the simple payment acceleration that is performed today, has the potential to align both providers and risk-bearing entities to drive success in VBC models.

Using a simplified 50% shared savings model under a MA capitated arrangement, we find that high-quality and engaged PCPs can almost 2x their compensation ($237K to $450K), which is more than justified given the value of each PCP for an MA plan is $5.1M (10% EBITDA margins, 8x multiple). Providing additional cash flow in weeks or a month vs. the 18-24 months it takes today is transformational for PCPs.

**Dollar ($) Flow**
*   CMS pays MA plans an annual capitated rate of ~$15K per MA Enrollee, which varies based on HCC.
*   Risk-bearing PCP entities decrease medical expenses based on this capitated rate to drive medical margin and share in savings with PCPs (50% of $1.8K), which generates $900 in medical margin per patient per year.
*   Average PCP compensation is $237K today, but $900 in medical margin from shared savings per patient per year for 500 member panel can drive $450K in annual compensation (1.9x increase)

**Illustrative Economic Model**
*(Bar chart showing per-member-per-month (PMPM) values:)*

| Metric                                  | Value      |
| :-------------------------------------- | :--------- |
| PMPM Paid by CVS to MA Plan             | $15K       |

Agilon Health Example ($AGL Investor Presentation) Note: There are many models in MA, but $AGL has been used for simplicity of explanation.

**Value of an MA PCP:** After its strongest year of MA member enrollment in recent history, a VP at Humana said “We will run out of high-quality PCPs before we run out of members...”. This sentiment is shared across industry and backed up by the numbers. Assuming the same 500 patient panel size above, an annual capitation rate for medical expenses of $12.75K (after plans take their 15% cut) and a 10% EBITDA margin and 8x EBITDA multiple given current public valuations, we demonstrate the value of a single PCP to be $5.1M. Importantly, payment acceleration does not require payers to pay providers any more than they currently are, and in often cases they can pay less because providers are so desperate for cash upfront. For example, Change is shifting providers to their cash cow virtual card service that charges 5%-7% of receivables for accelerating payment by a few weeks (e.g., 11 months instead of 12 months).

## Why now?
**Policy Forcing Change:** Unfortunately, the federal debate on MA has devolved into an overly “simplistic academic discourse” on whether outcomes and cost are better or worse in MA versus FFS Medicare. While this debate continues to unfold, the reality is that >50% of beneficiaries are enrolled in MA today and the HCC risk adjustment system has changed little in 20 years. With this backdrop, CMS finalized a rule in January that details how it will handle Risk Adjustment Data Validation (RADV) audits to determine whether MA plans were overpaid by Medicare. The rule wants to claw back $5B in overpayments and is the first sign that private insurers MA cash cow could be threatened. Health insurers will put up a legal fight, but ultimately insurers will need to adopt new technologies to survive and thrive in a new environment.

**Antiquated Technology:** Many of the large technology vendors in the space today (Change, Inovalon, Edifecs, etc) are behemoths built on decades old technology pieced together through a number of acquisitions. Change has rolled up a lot of the space, with no fewer than 13 acquisitions in 11 years. Change was originally a WebMD company renamed Emdeon in 2005. In 2015, they acquired another company called Change and rebranded with that name. In 2016, McKesson merged its IT unit with Change. We've seen with other RCM companies in our portfolio (e.g., SmarterDx) that teams laser-focused on product and sales that build on a modern data stack can take market share from incumbent players.

**Unwilling or Unsophisticated Competition:** Change Healthcare, for example, is fundamentally unwilling to develop any innovation that will cannibalize their current cash cow. Change was targeting to sign up 200K providers by the end of 2022 to charge 5%-7% of receivables for accelerating payments by a few weeks. Change is directly benefiting from the friction they create and has no incentive to change. Other startups in the space offering less sophisticated versions of accelerated payments (Vytalize/Stellar) have a limited understanding of end-to-end payer operations and are also unlikely to build these sophisticated solutions.

**PCP Shortages:** According to the Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. needs 16,000 more PCPs to meet the demand for consistent care. COVID has exacerbated long-standing, operational challenges, and burnout among PCPs, while reimbursement hasn't kept pace with inflation. While excitement continues around MA and plans announce massive enrollment numbers, many plans "are going to run out of PCPs before they run out of members" (VP, Humana). This provider shortage will only worsen over the next 3-5 years and payers and other risk-breaking entities are looking for solutions to increase provider efficiency and ways to acquire and retain high-quality PCPs.

## Competitive Landscape: Risk-adjusted Payment Acceleration is Non-existent Today
We focus on four players that the market refers to most often when discussing a less sophisticated version of payment acceleration: Change, Stellar, Vytalize, and Clover.

*   **Change Healthcare (Clearinghouse):** After much scrutiny and an antitrust lawsuit, Change Healthcare was acquired for $13B by $UHG in Oct of 2022. Change processes 15B transactions and $1.5T in claims annually, serving 19 of the top 20 US payers and ~200M members with its solutions. Change was targeting to sign up 200K providers by the end of 2022 to charge their 5%-7% of receivables for accelerating FFS payments by a few weeks.
*   **Stellar Health (Point-of-care tool):** Stellar Health ($75M raised, $1B valuation) provides point-of-care tools for providers and offers micro-incentives every month ($10) to close care gaps.
*   **Vytalize Health (ACO Reach enablement):** Vytalize ($75M raised, $X valuation) provides data analysis, care coordination, network management, and quality incentives for providers in the ACO Reach program. Similar to Stellar, the "payment acceleration” the company describes is focused on quality incentives, rather than risk-adjustment, leading to lower payouts for PCPs.
*   **Clover ($CLOV; MA Plan offering point-of-care tool):** Clover Assistant (CA) is a point-of-care tool offered to providers to accelerate office visits payments to PCPs as soon as the provider completes the visit on the CA tool. VS is in discussions to power the risk-adjusted portion of payment acceleration for Clover because the company has been unable to build this to-date.

## Business Model Breakdown
VS' top priority today is building ops and tech infrastructure to lay the foundation for future profitability growth with payment acceleration.

**Our Volume + Our Growth**
*(Image displays a process flow diagram, similar to the "Data Refinement Process", with additional descriptions for volume and growth on the right side. The core process flow includes EMR, Generate Medical Record, Practice Management, Generate Claim / Encounter, Clearinghouse, Route Claim, Claims Processing System, Pay Claim, Retrospective Chart Pull, Retrieve Old Medical Record, Clinical Review / Risk Adjustment / Quality / CAHPS, Regenerate Encounter.)*
*   **Prospective Review Encounter Volume:** Will grow with AMEH this year but not new customers yet (~$5 / encounter + Risk Adjustment Revenue)
*   **837 Volume:** Will stay consistent ($0.24 / paper document + $0.20 / misdirected claim)
*   **Retrospective Chart Review Volume:** Will grow with all new customers this year. (~$2 / encounter)

**Tech-enabled services:** VS is charging for tech-enabled services on a per encounter basis at a significantly lower cost basis than incumbents ($16-$17 vs. $75) and still operating with positive unit economics on a per encounter basis. As shown in the image above, not all encounters will yield the same value. The numbers above reflect a very roughly estimated blended number. For example, medication reconciliation encounters may cost less than risk adjustment encounters because they are much less work to do.

**Payment Acceleration:** VS goal is to commoditize incumbents' cash cows and drive profitability off of the payment acceleration business. Because payment acceleration is an entirely novel approach, the exact business model for 2025/2026 timeframe is unknown. It is highly likely, however, the payment acceleration would shift away from a per encounter fee as it is more focused focused on a members' overall health throughout the year (e.g., PMPY model discussed below).

**GTM:** VS has been strategic to-date in leveraging management's Apollo relationship to dogfood initial product development, establish a beachhead, and collect valuable data. As the company scales over the next 2-3 years, management is laser-focused on avoiding hand-to-hand combat to acquire individual provider groups. One example of a creative GTM strategy is leveraging Apollo providers' relationships with a wide variety of players across the managed care landscape. Once a payer (Humana, CVS/Aetna, United, etc) is receiving claims generated from VS, the company can more easily expand into those organizations. When expanding to different risk-bearing provider groups, VS will be strategic about expansion and what exact services the company will provide. For example, Oak Street Health employs its providers directly (as compared to Apollo with its MSO structure) and has built its own internal EMR Canopy. Oak Street has seen initial success with its internal technology and influence over PCPs (e.g., internal huddle-ups to force proactive risk adjustment), but Oak Street is struggling to build a Enterprise Master Patient Index (EPMI) with Palantir. Oak Street is struggling to get information from the EHR to match up with claims data it gets from MA plans.

The exact end-solution for customers will evolve over time, but VS' operational and technical infrastructure is built with a singular goal in mind for ALL risk-bearing entities: generate clean claims with risk-adjustment and quality scores with appropriate clinical context.

## Financials: Shifting from Take Rate to PMPY
VS has the potential to reach $5M in revenue over the next 2-3 years from Apollo alone, expand to 3-4 other customers, and drive additional growth through the shift to payment acceleration. These opportunities are massive (even with Apollo alone) and we are being extremely conservative to take into account VS' deliberate approach to growth.

**Current financials and Projections:** VS ended 2022 with $500k in recurring revenue and $500k in professional services revenue. In 2023, VS will shift to recurring revenue with Apollo as the company builds tighter integrations with Apollo's back-end systems. The company is only burning $20k - $40k per month, depending on how much operational burden is placed on its team. Including R&D, VS is breakeven or slightly negative every month.

We use Apollo as an ideal customer profile to understand future growth with risk-bearing entities, recognizing its 1.3M members in VBC is the highest among its next-gen primary care public comps (Agilon, Privia, Oak Street, etc) and other regional MA plans. We assume 3-4 customers are generating $3M in revenue in 2025 ($750K - $1M each).

**Virtue Conservative Revenue Projections**

|                         | 2022   | 2023   | 2024   | 2025   | 2026   |

| **Total Revenue ($M)**  | **$1.0** | **$2.0** | **$3.5** | **$8.0** | **$15.0** |
| Apollo Revenue          | $1.0   | $1.5   | $2.5   | $5.0   | $10.0  |
| Other Customers         |        | $0.5   | $1.0   | $3.0   | $5.0   |
| Tech-enabled Service (%)| 100%   | 100%   | 100%   | 75%    | 50%    |
| Payment Acceleration (%)| 0%     | 0%     | 0%     | 25%    | 50%    |

**Assumptions:** We use two different frameworks to understand the potential revenue opportunity for VS. Medical billing comps more accurately reflect the value of VS today, while PMPY models represent the shift to longitudinal value creation with payment acceleration. We are very conservative with these assumptions and take a 50% haircut of current comps.

*   **Medical billing as floor (take rate):** VS provides much more than a medical billing company (turning paper to electronic, misdirected claims, clearinghouse functions, finding suspected ICD's, coding) but this helps frame the minimum potential revenue capture with Apollo alone. We take Apollo's total capitated revenue and take a 50% discount on the current industry standard medical billing take rate of 5-8% (50% of midpoint of 6.5%) given VS' operational capacity to provide low-cost services. This $29M represents the potential opportunity for expansion within Apollo alone if VS was optimizing solely for revenue. We expect VS to penetrate 10%-15% of this opportunity because of its deliberate focus on developing infrastructure vs. maximizing for growth.

**Medical Billing Comp**

| Metric                          | Value                 |
| :------------------------------ | :-------------------- |
| Apollo Total Capitated Revenue  | $888,000,000.00       |
| VS % Take Rate                  | 3.3%                  |
| **TOTAL**                       | **$28,860,000.00**    |

*   **VBC Enablement as Ceiling (PMPY):** VS' payment technical and operational capabilities go above and beyond Clarify, but we use it as a current market comp to reflect the size of the opportunity. Clarify's product offering for VBC is shown below. It is representative of current market offering today for broader VBC enablement solutions for payers - mostly analytics focused (little/no operational infrastructure) and based on 3rd party aggregated data sets. Clarify is able to charge up to $10 PMPY so we assume $5M PMPY for VS's more valuable solution to be conservative.

## Key Milestones: Capital Efficient Approach to Validating Payment Acceleration
With this $2.5M financing, VS can capital efficiently develop new tech-enabled services, gain a foothold into risk-bearing entities, and build the infrastructure and collect data required to launch payment acceleration. We view this round as a discounted Series A given VS current traction and runway to accomplish these milestones over the next 2-3 years.

*   **Technical and Operational Infrastructure:** VS has built Redbird, Magneto, and Jubilee as described above. The company will apply ML to lever up the current tooling and build new products (e.g., auto-adjudication) to expand its offerings across the stack in a capital efficient manner.
*   **Beachhead:** VS can rip and replace a risk-bearing entities entire back-end, making their services very sticky. This strategy enables them to establish a beachhead with strategic customers and leverage provider in-roads to get to payers. Providers in Apollo's network work with multiple MA plans in a certain geography, enabling a bottoms-up GTM to gain traction directly with plans.
*   **Getting to payment acceleration:** VS can at least 5x its current value by developing its payment acceleration product with this round. In addition to the infrastructure above, the company needs to collect data to understand how to underwrite risk for payment acceleration (e.g., who gets paid how much and when?). The company is breakeven to slightly negative each month, only burning $20-$40K / month while generating ~$1M in revenue, and we expect this dynamic to continue until they unlock value with payment acceleration.

## Virtue Fund Returner / Success Story
Below is the scenario analysis we walk through internally to compare the distribution of returns and outcomes for VS to a dataset of similar venture outcomes. The scenarios, exit values, and probabilities below reflect 4 key points
*   Higher probability of success at lower exit values given current traction, product, and team (e.g., if VS remains a low-cost billing solution for Apollo)
*   Lack of dilution given capital efficient nature of company build
*   Timeline to payment acceleration and value-creation (7+ years) vs. near-term opportunity
*   The massive value creation of payment acceleration, as demonstrated with increasing exit values in scenario #3 and #4

## Opportunities / Risks
### Opportunities
*   **N-of-1 founder:** Gerald is a product-focused, repeat founder with deep experience in managed care who launched a healthcare business in Indonesia. We have never seen this combination of skill sets in market and that differentiation is reflected in every facet of the business - from product development to capitalization strategy to GTM.
*   **Massive market dominated by PE-backed incumbents:** RCM, and specifically payment integrity and claims editing, is a massive market dominated by PE-backed players unable to innovate because it would disrupt their cash-cows. Microsoft's embrace of ChatGPT with Bing is a great example of this counter-positioning. Google would never ship this feature because it undermines search ads revenue to move to an answers based model. We have seen firsthand with other companies in our portfolio (e.g., SmarterDx) that startups built on a modern data stack with best-in-class workflow and tooling can displace incumbents by providing 10x better products and solutions.
*   **Series A @ Seed price:** Gerald could raise a $10M+ Series A today if that was his ambition. We were fortunate to have access to this deal through our relationship with Apollo from other portfolio companies, and are leveraging this relationship to invest in a discounted Series A round. We are extremely bullish about the value that a payment acceleration can create for the company. We are excited to get involved at an important inflection point for VS as the company capital-efficiently tests a novel hypothesis around payment acceleration that, if true, dramatically increases the enterprise value of the company.

### Risks
*   **Fails to get beyond tech-enabled services:** VS is providing valuable, but service-heavy solutions today (2x-3x multiple) to build the foundation for future growth. If VS fails to build the necessary data or tech/operational infrastructure for payment acceleration, there is a risk that the company remains a low-cost medical billing service. The way VS has built its infrastructure and management's' approach give us confidence that VS can develop a wide variety of products across the RCM stack. Payment acceleration is only one of those options.
*   **Risk-adjusted payment acceleration isn't valued by market:** The current hypothesis is that payment acceleration is the most valuable analytics product that can be built on top of VS' current technical and operational infrastructure. There are strong signal that providers value risk-adjusted payment acceleration given that they already value the less sophisticated solutions on market today. However, since it's an entirely new product, VS might develop all of the tech-enabled services required, collect enough data, and launch payment acceleration to an unenthusiastic customer base.
*   **Apollo concentration:** There is always a risk that early-stage startups building initial product for a large enterprise client get stuck building a product that is unique to that large organization and doesn't scale. The initial validation that Apollo provides as a leader in the managed care market, the reach Apollo gives VS into Apollo's payer partners, and the freedom to build internal tools (vs. Apollo-facing tooling) protect VS from this common mishap.
