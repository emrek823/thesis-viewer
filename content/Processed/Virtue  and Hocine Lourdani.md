### Business Updates & Market Context

- Still early in journey since last conversation
- Experience from DeepCell - launched new omics regularly; designed cloud platform for visualization and omics integration
- Identified mess in the space while looking for right anchor point
- Focusing on multi-omics as key dynamic in biotech R&D
- Contrarian viewpoint: Industry’s reproducibility challenge isn’t a format problem but a tooling problem
- Current focus on interoperable datasets and integration

### Product Strategy & Differentiation

- Execution critical in this market
- Primary focus on integration and analysis software
- Building unified ecosystem for multi-omics research
- Key components:
	- Data harmonization layer (next build phase)
	- Data integration analysis engine (prototype with early users)
	- Data curation engine (post-Series A)

### Market Analysis: Why Bioinformatics Companies Haven’t Scaled

- Companies typically fail by doing too much or too little
- Two common pitfalls:
	- Too narrow: Products attached to sequencers with limited analysis capability
	- Too broad: Trying to cover all bioinformatics at once
- Business model: SaaS + professional services
- Future opportunity: Marketplace for multi-omics datasets on common platform

### Early Traction & Customers

- Early prototype users include:
	- UCSF
	- Senta Anabio (biotech company in Bay Area)
	- L’Oreal
	- Lesage (agriculture space)
- Key customer pain point: In-house data generation inefficiencies
	- Interdisciplinary teams working months to generate data
	- Additional 6-9 months for data collection and analysis

### Funding & Growth Plans

- Self-funded pre-seed stage
- Clean cap table
- Raising $3M on SAFEs
- Key objectives:
	- Launch MVP
	- Ramp up sales
	- Reach $1.5M+ ARR by late 2026
	- Target Series A in 2027

### Team

- Professor at Emre College in London (world-leading expert in statistical/ML models for multi-omics)
- Sebastian: Multiple-time founder with consulting experience in biotech
- Strong network across pharma, biotech, cosmetics, and agriculture
