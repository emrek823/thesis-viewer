### Document Strategy and Investor Positioning

- Executive summary improvements
	- New opening better frames the broader opportunity
	- Added “clinical and operational AI” framing
- Historical paradigm shift examples added
	- Standard Oil, US Steel, GM parallels to Blueprint’s approach
	- Need to complete the analogy showing Blueprint as the modern equivalent
- Two-by-two matrix needed to differentiate from roll-up strategies
	- Will clarify build vs buy arbitrage visually
	- Addresses inevitable bucketing with current roll-up plays

### Build vs Buy Economic Model

- Core arbitrage math simplified
	- Roll-ups pay $5-8M to acquire $1M EBITDA
	- Blueprint pays $100K to build same $1M EBITDA
	- With roll-up capital, could build 50-80 similar operations
- Time argument against roll-ups
	- Deal structuring, sourcing, negotiations add complexity
	- Integration costs and management replacement create delays
	- Build approach actually faster than acquisition timeline
- What to own vs buy decision framework
	- Operational tools: buy off-shelf (auth, scheduling)
	- Clinical capabilities: build proprietary (drives gross margin)
	- Integration and coordination: core competency to develop

### Document Structure Updates Needed

- Add company structure and timeline details
	- Equity ownership across OpCos
	- Capital allocation and staging
	- Series A planning and dilution
- Include one deep-dive OpCo example
	- Pediatric behavioral health expansion
	- Business model and implementation approach
	- Half-page overview sufficient
- Triple aim explanation less critical for current audiences

### Thursday Investor Meeting Approach

- Strategy: conversational first, selective follow-up
	- Frame as exploring larger opportunity beyond current success
	- Avoid sending full 40-page memo upfront
	- Send executive summary only if meeting goes well
- Positioning narrative
	- Anna performing ahead of schedule
	- Considering much larger $5-10B opportunity vs current $1B path
	- Seeking feedback on broader blueprint approach
- Meeting logistics: 5:30pm with Daisy, potential meetup with Emre before/after
