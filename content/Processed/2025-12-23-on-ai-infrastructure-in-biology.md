Mike Tyson famously said that “everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face.” As the COVID bubble burst, we learned that “every biotech has a plan until the market collapses.”

The pandemic spurred enormous enthusiasm for biotech investment. Stocks soared and many new companies were listed. I’m not going to belabor the point, but this catalyst was temporary. High-flying companies found themselves in a world of hurt.

We are still living through the aftermath right now. While the [S&P 500](https://www.financecharts.com/etfs/SPY/performance/total-return) has more than doubled over the past five years, the [XBI](https://www.financecharts.com/etfs/XBI/performance/total-return) has failed to fully *regain* its value over the same time frame.

But the biotech industry has fundamentals on its side. [Patent cliffs](https://www.biospace.com/business/5-pharma-powerhouses-facing-massive-patent-cliffs-and-what-theyre-doing-about-it) are still looming and the world’s armamentarium is still *far* from complete. Nothing about the current market cycle changes the fact that we are living through a renaissance in biology and technology. Our tools for understanding and engineering life are compounding.

And few industries offer a more direct way to produce financial returns by advancing scientific and human progress. In other words, it’s still a *beautiful* way of doing well by doing good.

Investors had to figure out how to get back on the horse. The return of capital to the sector happened in fits and starts. In 2023, there was a [big contraction in investment](https://endpoints.news/biopharma-venture-funding-falls-to-the-lowest-total-since-2019-as-startups-ponder-alternative-paths/) relative to the hyperactive cycle of 2020-2022. Less deals happened.

When dealmaking returned, it happened unevenly. In 2024, we [saw a spree](https://endpoints.news/the-megaround-rebound-private-biotechs-rack-up-100m-financings/) of $100M+ “mega-rounds” happen. Large syndicates formed to insulate companies from market volatility. Basically, a small set of anointed companies raised a lot of money. Investors seemingly sought safety in numbers.

Many of these bets reflected viewpoints on where the next big blockbuster will be. Immunology, neuroscience, and oncology were major focus areas. Next-generation modalities like *in vivo* cell therapies and T-cell engagers were also palatable.

Another major theme—which is also one of the major themes of this newsletter—has been AI for biotech. Massive new investments are being made.

In April of 2024, we saw a [$1B “Seed” round](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/new-ai-drug-discovery-powerhouse-xaira-rises-1b-funding) go to Xaira, a business aiming to reimagine many layers of drug discovery R&D with AI. This was one of the largest initial financings in the history of our industry.

Xaira was not alone. In June of 2024, Formation Bio [raised $372M](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/ai-focused-formation-secures-sanofi-backed-372m-series-d-license-more-drugs) for their own thesis on accelerating biotech with AI. In March of this year, Isomorphic Labs [raised $600M](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/ai-biotech-isomorphic-labs-hauls-600m-power-next-gen-drug-design-model) to continue scaffolding a new pharma organization around the research lab that produced the AlphaFold breakthrough.

As an early-stage investor, part of my job involves talking to a lot of different people across academia, biotech, and pharma. Broadly speaking, people don’t find these investments *that* crazy. We’ve been desensitized to mega-rounds over the years. Drug discovery is expensive! And it’s becoming consensus that AI will play a meaningful role in the future of biotech R&D.

But another set of deals is drawing more initial skepticism. Businesses such as EvolutionaryScale, Chai Discovery, Cradle Bio, Achira, Latent Labs, and Axiom have also recently raised large sums of capital to build AI solutions for biotech. A major difference between this set of companies and the likes of Xaira, Formation, and Isomorphic is that they seem to be pursuing value creation by selling technology rather than drugs.

This triggers strong reactions. Schrödinger is *constantly* cited as an example of how hard this business model is. After 35 years in business selling some of the leading drug discovery software solutions, their market cap is ~$1.5B. This is nothing to sneeze at, but it pales in comparison to the [value created](https://centuryofbio.com/p/nimbus) from *single* drugs developed using their technology, such as the sale of Nimbus’s TYK2 program for more than $4B.

**The overarching sentiment is that drugs create far more value than discovery tools and that nothing about AI will change that.** If you have a great new discovery technology, the most logical thing to do is to use it to make new drugs. The subtext is, “What are all these founders and investors thinking?!”

There is a kernel of truth to this. I spend a lot of my time searching for new platform companies with technologies that can make otherwise impossible drugs. One of the evaluation criteria for AI in biotech *should* be whether it leads to the development of fantastic new medicines that improve the human condition.[1](https://centuryofbio.com/p/infra?r=kmfsl&amp%3Butm_medium=ios&triedRedirect=true#footnote-1-176142402)

But I don’t think that means there can’t be massive, objectively investable infrastructure businesses that create a lot of value for the industry. In tech, it’s completely obvious that infrastructure businesses providing tools rather than end products can be huge. Consider Datadog, a >$50B public company that provides cloud [observability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observability_(software)) solutions—in other words, infrastructure for managing your infrastructure.

The most extreme example is NVIDIA. The biggest company in the history of the world is an infrastructure provider.

**So, how might AI infrastructure companies actually create** ***and*** **capture value in biotech?**

To explore this, I want to tell you three possible *stories* about the technological and structural evolution of our industry. Each story has *parameters*, which are numerical placeholders whose values you can personally estimate based on your own beliefs about the future.

## Compute as a Reagent

Twenty five years ago, the biotech industry spent exactly $0 on high-throughput DNA and RNA sequencing. That’s an obvious statement because the technology hadn’t been invented yet. And it certainly hadn’t [dramatically decreased in cost](https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/fact-sheets/DNA-Sequencing-Costs-Data).

**[Last year](https://s24.q4cdn.com/526396163/files/doc_financials/2024/q4/40bb9893-0143-45cf-adff-78437abde278.pdf), Illumina, the largest next-generation sequencing (NGS) company, generated $4.4B in revenue.**

Factoring in the rest of the players in the market, the total annual spend on NGS is around ~$10B—which is [the number](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/next-generation-sequencing-market) most of the market research firms converge on.[2](https://centuryofbio.com/p/infra?r=kmfsl&amp%3Butm_medium=ios&triedRedirect=true#footnote-2-176142402)

How did this happen? What drove the increase from $0 to ~$10B?

First, NGS became a ubiquitous tool in the life sciences research market. Illumina describes this market by saying, “This includes laboratories associated with universities, research centers, and government institutions, along with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies.”

Labs around the world were able to answer new questions. Initially, researchers used NGS to sequence and compare genomes. Use cases evolved. As [functional genomics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_genomics) emerged, massive gene expression experiments became drivers of continued growth and adoption. In 2022, we saw the first [genome-wide CRISPR perturbation experiment](https://centuryofbio.com/p/genotype-phenotype-maps), which involved sequencing over *two million* single cells.

This scale of experiment—let alone the CRISPR technology—would be basically unimaginable to scientists even a decade ago. **The crucial point is, as NGS declined in cost, it proved to be** ***elastic*****, meaning that scientists kept figuring out ways to use even more of it.**

In addition to the research market, NGS is now used in the clinic. Two of the largest clinical uses are noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) and cancer screening (both for diagnostics and *prognostics* to help predict treatment responses and guide care). These are both valuable applications with huge markets that are projected to keep growing.

Rare disease diagnosis and infectious disease monitoring are also big drivers of clinical NGS growth. And just like the growth of the research market, it seems likely that we’ll keep discovering new clinical applications of sequencing. For example, [T-cell receptor and B-cell repertoire sequencing](https://doi.org/10.1111/pin.13284) could become an integral part of autoimmune diagnosis in the future.

**It’s worth noting what NGS** ***didn’t*** **do.** Despite the optimism around deciphering “the genetic blueprint for human beings,” as President Clinton [stated](https://clintonwhitehouse5.archives.gov/WH/EOP/OSTP/html/00628_4.html), genomics *didn’t* solve biology. And it *didn’t* solve drug discovery or disease diagnosis.

**But it** ***did*** **prove to be a foundational technology that justified converting a growing amount of capital into biological information.** NGS *was* a technological breakthrough for biology. It continues to deliver real value to researchers and clinicians around the world.

The NGS market has consistently sustained a double digit (~11%) compound annual growth rate and doesn’t seem to be slowing down.[3](https://centuryofbio.com/p/infra?r=kmfsl&amp%3Butm_medium=ios&triedRedirect=true#footnote-3-176142402) It’s not absurd to imagine the market growing to >$30B over the next decade.

So, that’s value *creation*. What about value *capture*?

The primary way that NGS companies make money is by selling consumables—which are the reagents and materials needed for an experiment—at a healthy margin. In 2024, Illumina made 12% of their revenue from selling instruments and 72% of their revenue from consumables.[4](https://centuryofbio.com/p/infra?r=kmfsl&amp%3Butm_medium=ios&triedRedirect=true#footnote-4-176142402) The gross margins on their core business were 67.1%.

As NGS became a ubiquitous technology, people built businesses on top of it. For example, 10X Genomics sells instruments and consumables to prepare samples for single-cell sequencing experiments. In 2024, they generated $610M of revenue, with $493M of that coming from consumables.

Clinical NGS companies make money by selling tests. Some of these businesses are growing very quickly. In 2022, Natera generated ~$800M in revenue. By 2024, this had more than doubled to ~$1.7B, with gross margins increasing from 44.4% to 60.3% in the same time period.

**Interestingly, because clinical NGS is growing so quickly, Natera is now a bigger company than Illumina—who is the provider of the actual underlying sequencing technology!** As of writing, Natera’s market cap is ~$31B and Illumina’s is ~$18B.[5](https://centuryofbio.com/p/infra?r=kmfsl&amp%3Butm_medium=ios&triedRedirect=true#footnote-5-176142402)

What [Powers](https://tyastunggal.com/p/7-powers-the-foundations-of-business) give these businesses the ability to command such strong margins?

I’ve already [taken a crack](https://centuryofbio.com/i/136522755/strategic-analysis) at trying to explain this for Illumina. In large part, the primary Powers are two-fold. They have Cornered Resources in the form of a **complex thicket of patents** protecting their proprietary sequencing chemistry. Illumina also emerged as a **definitive research standard**, which introduced Switching Costs as well as Network Economies. People benefit from having the sequencing machine that most assay and software developers are developing new solutions for.

Similarly, Natera has their own IP portfolio for their tests. There is likely also the benefit of being an early mover to gain reimbursement and adoption by clinicians. But Natera will have to continue to fend off competitors, [including Illumina](https://www.illumina.com/clinical/reproductive-genetic-health.html) and [BillionToOne](https://www.billiontoone.com/), who just had a [fantastic IPO](https://www.forbes.com/sites/amyfeldman/2025/11/06/how-a-turkish-immigrant-engineered-a-successful-diagnostics-startup-ipo-billiontoone/).

**So, what does any of this have to do with AI?**

Just as NGS rapidly permeated the research market, scientists around the world are integrating new AI tools into their work. Arguably, the adoption is happening faster and is more widespread.

**And just as NGS led to growth in spend on chemistry reagents, AI is driving growth for another type of research reagent: compute.**

Taken together, these two facts could lead to greater research productivity *and* the growth of large businesses.

Let’s make this more concrete.
