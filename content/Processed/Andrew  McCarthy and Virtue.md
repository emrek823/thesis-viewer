### Axo Longevity Company Overview

- Europe’s first high-performance consumer preventive health platform
	- Targeting 5 billion euro high-performance market (elite athletes, biohackers, high performers)
	- Goal: 5% market share in 2-3 years = 250M ARR
	- Company is 13 weeks old, raised pre-seed 6 weeks ago
- Business model mirrors proven US companies (Function, Superpower)
	- €499 twice-yearly membership + add-ons (targeting €750 AOV)
	- 70% recurring revenue, 30% add-ons
	- Projecting 50% retention, 70% gross margins at scale
- Key differentiators from US competitors:
	- Optimized biomarkers based on demographics vs generic ranges
	- Better user experience control (addressing Function’s lab scheduling issues)
	- AI-powered customer-facing analysis and conversations

### European Market Strategy & Lab Partnerships

- Two markets ready for launch: Spain and UK
	- Spain: Partnership with Abaseive (hospitals/labs in 34 locations)
	- UK: Starting with retail solution, then larger partnerships
- Pan-European lab negotiations ongoing
	- In talks with Unilabs, Synlab, Limbach (largest European labs)
	- Building HL7 API integrations for older lab systems
	- Labs showing strong interest, some asking to invest
- Customer acquisition through micro-influencer armies
	- Paying €50-100 to influencers with 10k-100k followers vs macro influencers
	- Leveraging medical team’s connections to elite sports (Real Madrid doctor, access to NBA/NFL/Formula One)

### Next Steps
