# National Average Payment Table Update

The national average payment for each DRG is calculated by multiplying the current relative weight of the DRG by the national average hospital Medicare base rate. The national average hospital Medicare base rate is an average of the sum of four categories: Hospital Submitted Quality Data and is a Meaningful EHR User, Hospital Did NOT Submit Quality Data and is a Meaningful EHR User, Hospital Submitted Quality Data and is NOT a Meaningful EHR User, Hospital Did NOT Submit Quality Data and is NOT a Meaningful EHR User, using dollar amounts from new data published in the Federal Register FY 2025 Final Rule, Table 1A. National Adjusted Operating Standardized Amounts; Labor/Nonlabor (if wage index greater than 1) or Table 1B. National Adjusted Operating Standardized Amounts; Labor/Nonlabor (if wage index less than or equal to 1). This information is provided as a benchmark reference only. There is no official publication of the average hospital base rate; therefore, the national average payments provided in this table are approximate.

Calculated with an average hospital Medicare base rate of $6497.36. Each hospital's base rate and corresponding payment will vary. The national average hospital Medicare base rate is an average of the sum of four categories: Hospital Submitted Quality Data and is a Meaningful EHR User, Hospital Did NOT Submit Quality Data and is a Meaningful EHR User, Hospital Submitted Quality Data and is NOT a Meaningful EHR User, Hospital Did NOT Submit Quality Data and is NOT a Meaningful EHR User, using dollar amounts published in the Federal Register FY 2024 Final Rule, Table 1A. National Adjusted Operating Standardized Amounts; Labor/Nonlabor (if wage index greater than 1) or Table 1B. National Adjusted Operating Standardized Amounts; Labor/Nonlabor (if wage index less than or equal to 1). MS-DRGs 998 and 999 contain cases that could not be assigned to valid DRGs.

Note: If there is no value in either the geometric mean length of stay or the arithmetic mean length of stay columns, the volume of cases is insufficient to determine a meaningful computation of these statistics.

# DRG Decision Trees

## Pre-MDC

**Flowchart Description:**

This flowchart describes the decision process for assigning Pre-MDC DRGs. It starts with "ALL PATIENTS" and branches based on various criteria.

1.  **ALL PATIENTS** leads to a decision point.
    *   If "Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cell and Other Immunotherapies" is true, the DRG is **018**.
    *   Otherwise, the flow continues.

2.  Next decision is "Heart Transplant or Implant of Heart Assist System".
    *   If true, check for "MCC".
        *   If "MCC" is true, the DRG is **001**.
        *   If "MCC" is false ("No"), the DRG is **002**.
    *   Otherwise, the flow continues.

3.  Next decision is "ECMO".
    *   If true, the DRG is **003**.
    *   Otherwise, the flow continues.

4.  Next decision is "Tracheostomy".
    *   If true, then check for "MV > 96 Hours".
        *   If "MV > 96 Hours" is true, then check for "Major O.R. Procedure".
            *   If "Major O.R. Procedure" is true, the DRG is **003**.
            *   If "Major O.R. Procedure" is false ("No"), the DRG is **004**.
        *   If "MV > 96 Hours" is false ("No"), then check for "Except Face, Mouth, and Neck".
            *   If "Except Face, Mouth, and Neck" is true, then check for "Major O.R. Procedure".
                *   If "Major O.R. Procedure" is true, the DRG is **003**.
                *   If "Major O.R. Procedure" is false ("No"), the DRG is **004**.
            *   If "Except Face, Mouth, and Neck" is false ("No"), it leads to another decision point (labeled "1" at the bottom of the page, implying continuation to another tree or section not shown here for this specific path).
    *   Otherwise, the flow continues.

5.  Next decision is "Intestinal Transplant".
    *   If true, the DRG is **005**.
    *   Otherwise, the flow continues.

6.  Next decision is "Liver Transplant".
    *   If true, check for "MCC".
        *   If "MCC" is true, the DRG is **005**.
        *   If "MCC" is false ("No"), the DRG is **006**.
    *   Otherwise, the flow continues.

7.  Next decision is "Allogeneic Bone Marrow Transplant".
    *   If true, the DRG is **014**.
    *   Otherwise, the flow continues.

8.  Next decision is "Lung Transplant".
    *   If true, the DRG is **007**.
    *   Otherwise, it leads to another decision point (labeled "1" at the bottom of the page).

The decision point labeled "1" at the bottom of the page indicates a continuation or link to other parts of the DRG decision trees not fully displayed on this page.
