## Slide 1: Solace
# Solace
A MARKETPLACE FOR HEALTHCARE ADVOCATES

## Slide 2: WHAT IS A HEALTHCARE ADVOCATE?
WHAT IS A
HEALTHCARE ADVOCATE?

Healthcare advocates help patients navigate the medical system.
These advocates work directly with patients and providers to ensure people have access to the information they need to make the right decisions about their personal health.

## Slide 3: BRINGING HUMANITY BACK TO HEALTH.
BRINGING HUMANITY
BACK TO HEALTH.

The healthcare advocacy market has a massive existing TAM and is currently unbrokered. We're building a marketplace to consolidate this industry and capture a take rate.

Solace is a marketplace for healthcare advocates that provides access to experts who can:
*   Find the right doctor for you
*   Help you ask the right questions
*   Interpret medical jargon
*   Guide your decisions & next steps
*   Give you confidence in your health journey

## Slide 5: WHY NOW?
WHY NOW?

*   Trust in the medical system has deteriorated post-Covid. In a 2021 survey by the University of Chicago, 32% of respondents reported that their trust in the US healthcare system has "significantly declined" since the start of the pandemic.
*   Doctors are increasingly overworked, both in patient load and desk work. In 2014, only 33% of physicians reported spending more than 10 hours per week on paperwork. In 2021, across all specialties, doctors reported an average of 15.6 hours per week spent on paperwork and other administrative tasks.
*   Employers must offer increasingly-competitive benefits to attract top talent. In a competitive labor market, convenience is king, and employers are willing to pay for benefits that keep their people happy—as evidenced by a rise in B2B startups like Lyra Health ($5.6B) and Modern Health ($1.17B).

## Slide 6: THE PROBLEM:
THE PROBLEM:
THE U.S. HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IS INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE.

*   **DIAGNOSIS PARALYSIS**
    Understanding your health issues, your diagnosis, or where to turn is overwhelming.
*   **IMPERSONAL CARE**
    You'll see below-average doctors who aren't even specialists in your issue before you find the right one—if you ever do.
*   **EXPENSIVE CONSEQUENCES**
    You'll spend ten times more money than needed and still end up with subpar results.

## Slide 7: MARKET SIZE
MARKET SIZE

Advocacy is an emerging industry with a rapidly-scaling TAM. In the healthcare advocate space, there are currently over 1 million searches each month. As more people seek support with their health needs, supply is rising to meet that demand.

This effect is echoed in other healthcare spaces:
*   The mental healthcare market has increased 50% over the past decade as professional help becomes a social norm.
*   The elder care market has grown 54% in the same time span as America experiences its largest aging population to date.

### TOTAL EXISTING ADVOCATES
| Year | Number of Advocates |
| :--- | :------------------ |
| 2010 | 63,000              |
| 2016 | 289,000             |
| 2021 | 560,000             |

*   **Patient's Advocate.**
*   I'm Trisha Torrey, and since 2004 when I first became immersed in the American healthcare system, its possibilities, and its dysfunction, I have called myself Every Patient's Advocate.
*   That was a long time ago! And I'll admit that for the 54 years of my life before then, it never occurred to me I would become an expert on helping people get the great healthcare they deserve.
*   But then life happened, my world came crashing down – and here I am to tell the tale. I have spent these last many years using that world-crashing experience as my impetus to help YOU.

**WHY DO CONSUMERS NEED THIS?**
People are paying huge amounts of money already for advocacy, but the paths for patients to locate advocates are obscure and outdated. Solace can provide a reliable, modern health experience.

**WHY DO ADVOCATES NEED THIS?**
Current technological solutions for advocates are outdated, individualized and incomplete. Solace provides an easy-to-use, turnkey solution to help advocates find new clients and run their businesses.
