## Slide 13: A Golden Opportunity is Emerging for Valley Steer in Value Based Care

From 2019 to 2021, Investment in Value Based Care increased fourfold to $7b*

1.  **Massive Opportunity for Value Based Care (VBC) Proprietary Models**
    Our tests indicate that today's best models and frameworks are both inaccurate (<80%) and costly (~$0.10 per page) for VBC review tasks. We believe the necessary training data for these models does not exist yet, presenting a significant opportunity. We are developing proprietary models that promise lower costs and higher efficacy for VBC.

2.  **Increased Scrutiny and Heightened Enforcement of Medicare Coding**
    The Department of Justice (DOJ) has significantly intensified efforts to combat Medicare Advantage coding fraud in recent years. The solution isn't simply a better portal with more complicated technology that burdens providers even more; it's about completely rethinking the coding process with AI and technology-enabled services.

3.  **FTC Bans Non-Competes in Employment Contracts on April 23, 2024**
    Now that non-competes are banned, the only barriers physicians face to return to independent practice are administrative: inadequate infrastructure, financial pressures, resource limitations, and regulatory compliance issues. Our solution aligns payers with independent providers and subsidizes the infrastructure buildout to overcome these challenges.

## Slide 14: Our Payment Models

Our Team Leverages Our Healthcare Expertise To Find Opportunities and Minimize Workflow Changes

**Transaction Service**
We charge a fixed fee per visit or document, that is variable depending on the type of data.

**Examples:**
$0.30 per claim
$50 per visit

**Contingency Service**
We charge a performance fee for identifying information missed by existing vendors.

**Example:**
$75 per newly identified chronic disease*

\*Each additional chronic disease diagnosis is worth $1,000 to the health insurance company

## Slide 15: Raising $3m To Build Out AI and Sales Infrastructure

**AI**
*   Complete v1 of our AI infrastructure that enables non-technical staff to self-serve using our powerful LLM tools
*   Expand engineering team to increase velocity.

**Sales & Marketing**
*   Hire a head of payer sales to build on our traction in other geographies (currently we operate in SoCal, NorCal, and mid-Atlantic).
*   Build out provider success platform to build out concierge level support.

## Slide 19: Valley Steer's Unique Advantages

**AI + Clinicians**
We develop our own software and language models to reduce costs. Our clinicians then review the outputs to enhance accuracy.

**Distribution**
We contract directly with payers and collaborate on distribution to providers, eliminating the need to sell to each provider individually.

**Monetization Model**
We align incentives for both payers and providers, positioning ourselves within the payment flow without being categorized as an operating expense.

©2024 Proprietary and Confidential. All Rights Reserved. | 19

## Slide 20: What Uniquely Enables Valley Steer To Scale With Payers

*   **Data Reviewed By Clinicians (Not Admin Staff)**
    Our service is unique in the industry, as we are the only ones utilizing practicing clinicians to review clinical data, unlike our competitors who depend on administrative nurses or coders following strict protocols.
*   **No Upfront OpEx Costs**
    Our unique business model is performance-based, charging payers only for measurable results, ensuring our success aligns with theirs.
*   **AI with Humans in the Loop**
    Utilizing advanced large language models, we've created a cutting-edge multi-agent framework, incorporating clinician oversight to ensure our inferences are both cost-effective and highly accurate.
*   **Minimum Data Integration**
    Our models and staff, trained on millions of documents, require only a minimal random data sample to accurately gauge our potential impact with a customer.

## Slide 21: Valley Steer's Unique Value Proposition to PCPs

**Payer-Subsidized Back Office**
Providers are already incurring administrative burden for data reconciliation, coding, and billing of claims. However for Annual Wellness Visits, a significant part of the back-office expenses will be subsidized by the payers we work with.

**Minimal Workflow Changes**
We understand the administrative burdens on PCP's, therefore we integrate our support into their existing workflows, ensuring they benefit from our services without direct interaction with our technology.

**Not Another Provider Portal**
We simplify the process by not adding another portal for providers to manage. Instead, we integrate with existing payer portals or adapt to the provider's preferred communication method, whether it's fax, email, or direct mail / in-person.

## Slide 22: Annual Wellness Visit Incentive Payment Breakdown For Providers

### Chart: Annual Wellness Visit Incentive Payment Breakdown For Providers

**Chart Type:** Pie Chart

| Segment                       | Percentage |
| :---------------------------- | :--------- |
| Admin Fees / Valley Steer Potential | 66%        |
| Valley Steer Fee              | 25%        |
| Medical Fees                  | 9%         |

**Annual Wellness Visit (AWV)**
An AWV is a preventive healthcare appointment where a patient meets with their healthcare provider to review their overall health and wellness.

The majority (>80%) of an AWV can be performed by non-clinical staff including: Patient Intake and History Review, Measurement and Vital Signs, Screening Questionnaires, Review of Preventative Services, Health Education and Counseling, Documentation and Data Entry.

Valley Steer currently takes a 25% fee from an AWV payment, with the potential to increase to a 90% take rate by assuming additional administrative tasks.

## Slide 23: 10x Payer Return On Investment Breakdown

A Standard Annual Wellness Visit Payment is Approximately $200 - $300 per Member per Year.

### Chart: Payer Return On Investment Breakdown

**Chart Type:** Waterfall/Bar Chart

| Item                  | Value   |
| :-------------------- | :------ |
| Risk Adjustment Boost | $2,000  |
| Retrospective Review Fees | $100    |
| Cash Acceleration     | $200    |
| MLR / DM Impact\*     | $200    |
| Return on Investment  | $2,500  |

A real time review system typically yields 2 additional chronic disease diagnoses, which is worth an additional $2,000 per member per year for payers.

Additional savings come from the reduction of retrospective review fees, acceleration of cash and earlier management of chronic disease.

\*Medical Loss Ratio improvement will result from earlier detection and management of chronic disease.

| **From Provider:**                            |            |
|  Provider Non-Admin Work (9.4% of $200 = $18.8)| 9.4%       |
|  Provider Admin Work (43.1% of $200 = $86.2) | 43.1%      |
| **From Not Paid Out:**                        |            |
|  Valley Steer (25% of $200 = $50)            | 25%        |
| **From Staff:**                               |            |
|  Staff Admin Work (22.5% of $200 = $45)      | 22.5%      |

(Note: Percentages sum to 100% relative to the AWV Incentive Allocation, assuming a total of $200 incentive payment based on previous slide. The "Valley Steer" percentage is 25% of the initial allocation, which means $50 if the total allocation is $200, matching the 25% "Not Paid Out" from the Payer Side flow in slide 26. This implies Valley Steer takes the "Not Paid Out" portion.)

## Slide 29: The 4 Ways That Providers Get Paid Today

**Reimbursed Visits**
Reimbursements are for patient requested visits and paid based on services rendered

**Incentive Visits**
Incentives are for payer* requested visits and paid based on care quality, diagnoses, and patient demographics

**Quality / Risk Performance Payments**
Various quality and risk performance payments are made by payers to providers depending on contract structure.

**Per Member Per Month**
For Value Based Care markets, providers are sometimes paid per member per month.

## Slide 32: Incentive Payments Are Complex and Slow

Every $1 spent on Primary Care Provider (PCP) incentives is matched by at least $1 in administrative costs yet these payments still take up to 90 days to process.

**It's Hard For PCPs To Get Paid.**
**It's Hard For Payers* to Pay.**
*   Complex requirements
*   Administratively burdensome
*   Evolving policies and regulations

**Inefficient Retrospective Reconciliation**
(Diagram showing a flow with steps, weeks, and costs)

| Step | Description            | Duration  | Cost  |
| :--- | :--------------------- | :-------- | :---- |
| 1.   | PCP Send Claim         | 2 Weeks   | $15   |
| 2.   | Payer Process Claim    | 3 weeks   | $10   |
| 3.   | Payer Data Reconciliation Process | 4 Weeks   | $100  |
| 4.   | PCP Data Reconciliation Process | 5 Weeks   | $100  |

**Flow:**
PCP -> (1. Send Claim) -> Payer
Payer -> (2. Process Claim) -> Data Fidelity Ops
Data Fidelity Ops -> (3. Data Reconciliation Process) -> Payer
Payer -> (Data Fidelity Ops) -> (4. Data Reconciliation Process) -> PCP

\*Payers refers to health insurance companies, managed services organizations, and independent provider associations

## Slide 33: Our Payer Partnerships Provide A Foothold with PCPs

**Starting Payer**
20% of Patient Panel

**Example PCP**

**United Health**
30% of Patient Panel

**Aetna**
30% of Patient Panel

**Cigna**
20% of Patient Panel

**Step 1: Leveraging Payer Relationship To Enable The PCP**
Since payers collaborate with hundreds to thousands of primary care physicians (PCPs), we partner with payers to streamline their payments to PCPs and subsidize the development of the PCPs' coding and reconciliation infrastructure, enhancing efficiency and accuracy in their financial operations.

**Step 2: Leverage Enabled PCP's to Partner With New Payer**
After establishing the coding and reconciliation infrastructure with one PCP, we leverage this investment to expand our services to additional payers that the primary care physicians (PCPs) are contracted with, particularly within the same geography. This approach maximizes the utility of the infrastructure across multiple payer relationships, streamlining processes for PCPs.

## Slide 34: Why It Takes >90 Days To Get Incentives Paid Today

Payment processing for a PCP visit may extend up to 90 days due to difficulties in accessing and organizing disorganized data. Our first step involves collaborating with payers to expedite payments to PCP's.

## Slide 35: These Are Not Our Competitors

**Revenue Cycle Management**
Revenue Cycle Management (RCM) companies primarily aim to optimize providers' compensation for delivered services. Their economic model is largely built around hospitals and specialty practices, where billing complexities abound. These firms excel in navigating intricate billing environments, striving to ensure that providers secure maximum reimbursement for their services.

**Example Companies:**
CodaMetrix, AKASA, Fathom, Nym, Adonis, Hippocratic AI

**Portals / Middleware Platforms**
Payers utilize a mix of proprietary / vendor portals, and middleware platforms to enhance communications with providers. While at a glance our services may seem akin, we do not offer provider-facing technology. Instead, we power the backend, focusing on interpreting and reconciling unstructured data. Currently, we are in talks with numerous companies in this space to enhance their capabilities.

**Example Companies:**
Clover Assistant, Stellar Health, Optum, Availity
