Thrilled to launch RamaX: our platform for ultra-fast, accurate, and sensitive screening of massive binder libraries (from 1K to 1B minibinders, VHHs, or scFvs) in just 1-2 weeks.

This method has been an absolute game-changer for us at @diffuse\_bio. Internally, we’ve completely switched from yeast display to RamaX for screening our designs. We’re also using RamaX to generate enormous datasets to train our protein generative models. 🧵 1/

To validate RamaX, we pooled together a library of 80K AI-designed binders and used RamaX to pull out binders we had previously screened via yeast display. Incredibly, we recovered the expected binders while (1) screening against all antigens simultaneously, and (2) using a

We also found some previously uncharacterized binders that were 10-100x higher affinity. All in about a week. 3/

We next tested RamaX’s ability to find binders within a naive library of ~1e9 VHHs. Remarkably, we found VHH binders to 5 different antigens after 3 rounds of screening in <1 week. 4/

RamaX enables a rapid feedback loop for binder discovery and enables true data scaling for protein binder design models. We’re already working on additional tweaks that will enable data collection on multimodal properties at scale. AI performance scales with data 💪💪💪 6/

Finally, this work would not be possible without our researchers who went above and beyond to develop this new platform (while advancing many other exciting projects). Incredibly grateful to work with such a brilliant and dedicated team! 8/

This is amazing. Is there any limit of protein size or shape for the binder discovery?

Cool! Is this based on mRNA display?
