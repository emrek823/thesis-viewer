A new clinic is opening in Carberry, MB later this month that will focus on men's health, more specifically to diagnose prostate cancer more efficiently and effectively.

Manitoba urologist, Dr. Dave Maharajh has been working towards establishing the first clinic in Canada that uses advanced technology to take tissue samples with precision using the iSR’obot™ Mona Lisa, an AI-powered, robotic-assisted prostate diagnostics tool.

Dr. Maharajh is a recognized specialist in urology, having provided comprehensive general urological care in Canada for just under 35 years, twenty of those years being here in Manitoba.

Bringing over two decades of leadership experience in surgical care and regional health systems, Dr. Maharajh has a deep understanding of Canada's healthcare system.

He has served as Chief of Surgery in Corner Brook, Newfoundland, Vice President of medical services for Assiniboine Regional Health Authority and VP of Medical Services for the Parkland Regional Health Authority consecutively.  He was Medical Director at Winnipeg's Mount Carmel Clinic from 2006-2008.  And continues to be the Medical Director of Brandon's Wheat City Medical Clinic since 2006.

Over the past number of months, Dr. Maharajh has been winding down his practice at the Selkirk Regional Health Center to establish and prepare for the Carberry Care Centre expected to open later this month in the town of Carberry.

Currently, Dr. Maharajh serves as both Chief Medical Officer and CEO of PrecisionPro BioTech and PrecisionPro AI Diagnostics working with the iSR’obot™ Mona Lisa to lead the future of prostate cancer detection in Canada.

The Canadian Cancer Society estimates about one in nine men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer during their lifetime and one in 34 will die from it.

"But nonetheless, I had a passion for following up with prostate cancer patients and after seeing and hearing about biopsy technology, which is advanced, I realized that prostate biopsy has changed its paradigm of functioning in terms of the old system of doing trans-rectal autosome biopsy prostate," he explains.

"That is basically in simple words, taking samples of the prostate through the rectal wall with a needle, transforming itself into a transperineal biopsy of the prostate."

Using this new technology the needle will take the biopsy at the very center of the lesion, thus giving more accurate test results and minimizing the number of biopsy entry points.

"It is designed for precision to target the area of precisely putting the needle in the middle in the center of the lesion. So, this is actually great because it offers preciseness in a manner or form that we never envisioned. And hopefully this technology will gain ground across Canada and Carberry will actually be the first in Canada to really adopt that procedure and promote it across Canada.

The traditional method of inserting a thin needle through the rectum using ultrasound technology has a higher risk of infection (5-7%) in comparison to the AI-powered robotics procedure that has an infection rate of less than 0.1 %.   As well as a lower infection rate, patients can be biopsied as an outpatient from an office setting.

What are the statistics when it comes to men's health?

According to the Canadian Cancer Society, prostate cancer is the most common cancer among Canadian men. On average, 76 Canadian men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer every day.

While the risk for prostate cancer increases as men age, getting older is only one risk to consider.

Men in their 60s are most often diagnosed, often first through a consistently rising PSA level seen in a blood sample by their general practitioner - and then confirmed by an MRI and/or biopsies.  It's important to note a PSA test is often used to find prostate cancer early, however PSA levels can be higher than deemed 'normal' because of other factors such as an enlarged prostrate or a urinary tract infection.

Behaviors, substances or conditions can affect your chances of developing prostate cancer, as well as family genetics.  For example, if a man has a close relative (father, brother or son) who has been diagnosed, the greater the risk for developing prostate cancer.

It is estimated that about 1 in 8 Canadian men will develop prostate cancer during their lifetime and 1 in 30 will die from it.  In Manitoba those stats are much the same.  However, prostate cancer is not necessarily fatal.  When caught early, nearly 100% of men diagnosed will survive at least 5 years. But if it’s caught late, 5-year survival drops to 41%. That’s why prostate cancer screening through a simple blood test is so very important.

In the early stages of prostate cancer there are typically no signs or symptoms.  It is considered an indolent cancer, one that grows and spreads slowly. Symptoms will surface as the tumor grows, and that could include difficulty urinating, feeling excessively tired, or having pain or stiffness in the back, hips or pelvis that doesn’t go away.

Early detection key as prostate cancer rates rise in Manitoba

Manitoba's latest stats are from 2023 showing that 119 per 100,000 males are being tested as positive for prostate cancer as an incidence rate.  So, early detection is key to catching prostate cancer early.

"The majority of cancer we are picking up luckily for us is often low grades; stage one and stage two," says Maharajh. "So, the earlier the better, of course. And then if we can offer even precision medicine, then yes, we might even do better than to lower those stats.  But bringing men who have indolent cancers that are aggressive to the forefront and offering them earlier treatment is significant."

"This is significant for patients, significant in our healthcare system, significant in patients returning to the ER, significant in terms of admission, re-admission rates and use of ICU beds because you know, infection can be really disastrous at times and requiring our health services," he adds.

"So, after seeing the technology, I was inspired to bring it to Canada dealing with a company which manufactures the only robotic technology for doing transperineal in the prostate biopsy," he says. "And so, here I am trying to set this up in Carberry."

Carberry clinic brings robotic biopsy tech to fight prostate cancer

Dr. Maharajh had been working in the Carberry hospital for about 10 months and was looking for the ideal location for his new clinic; a location that would be cost-effective and provide enough space for his diagnostics equipment.

Carberry Mayor Ray Muirhead encouraged Maharajh to open his clinic in his southwest Manitoba town after seeing how instrumental the doctor was in the re-opening of the Carberry Health Centre in 2024.  He's eager to welcome him back to the community.
