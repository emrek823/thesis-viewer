At Customer’s request, Solstice’s personnel will access and use the Platform as Authorized Users on Customer’s behalf (the “Managed Services”).

## Fees and Payment Schedule

The fees as indicated below for [3] Teams for which Customer is using the Platform, invoiced and payable upfront in advance of each 1-year service term] If services begin at any point other than the start of a 1-year service term, the initial payment will be prorated based on the number of days remaining in that service term.
