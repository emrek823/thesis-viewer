## Physician-Validated Technology

*   We use all EMR data (labs, vitals, notes, meds, etc.) – over 30,000 data points per visit – and proprietary A.I. algorithms to laser-in on and uncover potential opportunities
*   These are vetted by board-certified, Ivy-league-trained physicians to ensure that appropriate guidelines (M.E.A.T. coding criteria) are met
*   Your CDI Specialists or Second Level Reviewers are given the recommended diagnosis as well as supporting evidence and impact in an easy-to-use workflow.
