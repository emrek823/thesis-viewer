## Summary
This is a technical correction document for a previous Medicare Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility (IRF) payment system rule. The document addresses typographical and technical errors in the original August 2025 rule regarding payment systems and quality reporting for IRFs.

## Startup Angle
While this specific correction doesn't create a direct startup opportunity, digital health and healthcare operations management startups focused on IRF compliance and payment optimization could use these technical details to refine their software. A potential opportunity would be a compliance tracking platform that helps rehabilitation facilities quickly adapt to nuanced CMS rule changes, ensuring accurate billing and reporting.
