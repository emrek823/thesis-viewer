## Slide 1: Cityblock - The first tech-driven healthcare provider built for underserved communities

CONFIDENTIAL

## Slide 2: A problem worth solving. Better care for healthier neighborhoods.

Proprietary & Confidential | 2 CITYBLOCK

*   **Low-income populations are falling through the cracks of America's social infrastructure.**
    Underserved communities are receiving suboptimal care, driving significant racial disparities in outcomes.
*   **Social factors underpin the majority of spend, but are ignored by traditional healthcare.**
    Traditional providers struggle to help members access social services that underpin health, and are not incentivized to do so.
*   **Healthcare has yet to unlock delivering care at scale, augmented by enabling technology.**
    Technology has not been built with the needs of highly diverse, multi-generational, multilingual families. Barriers such as internet access and literacy are systematically ignored.

COVID-19, its advent, its progression, and its aftermath, is **disproportionately impacting** these populations

## Slide 3: Massive annual spending in Medicaid and Dual Eligibles, with further growth expected to managed care

Proprietary & Confidential | 3 CITYBLOCK

The public payer market (Medicaid, Duals, Medicare) is a **$1.2T+ market**, with **$700B** under managed third-party care.

**Public Payer Market Breakdown (Pie Chart Data):**

| Category                             | Value    |
| :----------------------------------- | :------- |
| FFS Medicare and Medicaid            | $585B    |
| Remaining (non-complex) managed Medicare and Medicaid | $270B    |
| Complex MA                           | $125B    |
| Complex Managed Medicaid             | $180B    |
| Managed Dual Eligibles               | $120B    |
| **Total**                            | **$1,280B** |

**Cityblock sees significant opportunity to invest towards Medicaid and Duals populations:**

*   Massive TAM with transformational potential (75M Medicaid, 10M Duals, 25M complex Medicare)
*   Market barely penetrated, despite early wave of innovators already creating >$15B in enterprise value
*   Opportunity to create hundreds of billions in new value

**Continued movement towards managed care, the financial chassis that supports the Cityblock model:**

*   National and state governments working directly with providers to share risk (e.g., CMMI Direct Contracting)
*   Health plans increasingly moving providers to risk
*   COVID-19 exposing perils of volume-based FFS models

## Slide 4: Cityblock is the solution to today's fractured healthcare system

Commons, our care delivery platform, provides a 360° view of individual health and social needs, enabling inclusive care planning, multiple and integrated modalities of care delivery, protocolized alerts, and seamless care team workflows.

## Slide 7: Our model of care delivers better health outcomes and total cost of care savings, which we retain as profit from health plans

Proprietary & Confidential | 7 CITYBLOCK

**CITYBLOCK'S BUSINESS MODEL**

1.  Health plans contract with Cityblock to co-identify **impactable member populations**.
2.  Cityblock is paid **recurring fees** from day one for all assigned members, with market costs nearly always break-even from the start.
3.  Annual revenue per member of **$15,000-$30,000 in full capitation**. Varies by partner and sub-population.
4.  We **split the savings** (from reduced healthcare costs and increased revenue from diagnosis capture) as earnings.
5.  Contracting model unlocks unfair **member acquisition**; we contract for large groups of members all at once, with built in ramp for in-market growth.

**Cost of Care Comparison (Before vs. After Cityblock Intervention):**

| Cost Category          | Before (Relative Bar Height) | After (Relative Bar Height) |
| :--------------------- | :--------------------------- | :-------------------------- |
| Admin fee              | High                         | High (same)                 |
| Pharma, Other          | Medium                       | Medium (same)               |
| Outpatient             | Medium                       | Medium (same)               |
| Inpatient              | High (pink)                  | Low (pink)                  |
| Primary care, Behavioral health | Low (blue)                   | High (blue)                 |

**Key Outcomes:**

3.  The result is **total cost of care savings**, value that Cityblock captures as profit
2.  These investments deliver a **20-30% reduction in avoidable hospital use**
1.  We **increase primary care, behavioral health, and invest in addressing the social needs of our members**

## Slide 8: We are experiencing massive growth, with contracted ARR reaching $415M by YE 2020 (3.2x growth Y/Y)

## Slide 11: We build trusting relationships, meeting our members wherever they are, whenever they need us

Proprietary & Confidential | 11 CITYBLOCK

**Breaking down power dynamics to build trust**
Hired directly from the communities we serve, our Community Health Partners (CHPs) reflect the socio-economic, racial/ethnic, linguistic and cultural backgrounds of our members. We empower these members of the team to play key roles, flipping the hierarchy of traditional healthcare and giving voice to those most proximate to the communities we serve.

**Build relationships in-person or virtually, meeting members where they are**
Recruited and trained for empathy, emotional intelligence, problem-solving, accountability, and tenacity, our CHPs build trust through persistent, respectful outreach, meeting members wherever they are without judgment or stigma.

**Connect members to the right services, at the right time and place**
We equip care teams with digital tools designed for them to connect members with high-value social services and drive accountability for outcomes.

**Support and champion members in their efforts**
Our CHPs are trained in behavioral coaching, chronic disease management, health literacy, and interdisciplinary clinical communication. They amplify the care team's voice, collect health data, facilitate provider encounters, and support members in sustaining behavior change.

## Slide 12: Interdisciplinary teams (clinical, non-clinical, BH, pharmacy) work collaboratively to serve member needs, both as PCP and as a wrap

Proprietary & Confidential | 12 CITYBLOCK

**Advanced Primary Care**
Cityblock can be the attributed PCP for members without existing PCP relationships.

**Wrap Care Management**
Our care mgmt. services seamlessly augment and support existing PCP relationships.

**Care Team Diagram:**
*   CHP (Community Health Partner)
*   BH (Behavioral Health)
*   Member and Family (Center)
*   RN (Registered Nurse)
*   MD (Medical Doctor)
*   Specialty

**Key Points:**
*   Each member is assigned a designated **Community Health Partner** to support them in creating a personalized care plan, called a **Member Action Plan**, and to ensure they are connected with the care and social services they need.
*   Our **fully integrated care teams** — including PCPs, advanced care practitioners, NCPs, psychiatrists, BHSs, and LCSWs — collaborate closely on every member's care, coordinating delivery, **seamlessly integrating behavioral health** needs.
*   These flexible care teams **meet members wherever and whenever is convenient**, be it in their home, at a community spot, or virtually by phone, text, or video.
*   Our **care model and technology are flexible** enough to adjust between full ownership of the member relationship (as a PCP), or deeply impactful support for members with an existing PCP (wrap care).

## Slide 13: We deliver outcomes through a deep understanding of the heterogeneity of complex lower-income populations

Proprietary & Confidential | 13 CITYBLOCK

| Population Segment            | Socially isolated & unmanaged | Polychronic & undermanaged | Serious mental illness | Approaching end-of-life |
| :---------------------------- | :---------------------------- | :------------------------- | :--------------------- | :---------------------- |
| **Care model interventions**  | Non-clinical engagement (CHPs) and connection to CBOs and community resources | Interdisciplinary team (MD, RN, CHP) providing MTM, BH care, and social care | High-quality primary care integrated with accessible behavioral health | Advanced care planning with aggressive home-based primary care and palliative care |
| **Desired outcomes**          | Reduced social admits to the hospital | Better underlying health and fewer acute events | Reduced inpatient BH-driven admits | Reduced unnecessary end-of-life utilization |

Experience- and brand-driven retention captures recurring value over time

*(Data extracted visually, approximate values from graph)*

**Timeline of "What's happening with the member?":**

*   **08.22.18: "I can take care of my own medical needs"**
    During an initial call with an outreach specialist, Sonia insisted that she could take care of her medical needs. However, she noted that she was willing to meet with an outreach specialist in person to learn more about Cityblock services.
*   **11.30.18: "I'm having issues with paying my bills"**
    After months of missing and rescheduling appointments, Sonia arrived for an in person appointment at the hub. She mentioned that she was having issues with paying her bills and described personal goals, including losing weight, visiting the ED less, and signing up for unemployment.
*   **05.07.19: "I haven't eaten today"**
    Sonia came to the hub stating that she had not eaten that day. She also explained that she was not eligible for section 8 and that getting housing has been challenging. Her CHP bought her lunch and registered her for a food pantry. Sonia's CHP also informed about a short-term potential housing solution at the YMCA (respite housing).
*   **09.03.19: "I know this housing program is temporary but I've really enjoyed it"**
    During her stay at the YMCA, Sonia went to the ED far less than in weeks prior. She also engaged with Cityblock care team members 2x more than she had in the previous months -- from an average of less than 6 connections per month, to 16 connections during this month. When meeting with her Behavioral Health Provider, Sonia noted feeling happy and content with respite housing.
*   **06.05.20: "I'm not gonna just live anywhere"**
    During the COVID pandemic, Sonia's care team was able to coordinate a hotel stay, which lasted over a month. During her stay, Sonia's care team asked if she would be interested in supportive housing. Sonia was very hesitant, noting that she refused to live in any sort of projects, section 8 housing, or shelter. However, after months of coordination, her care team was able to find Sonia an apartment that she loved so much, that she signed the lease on the day of viewing.

## Slide 16: Trust and technology, together, build care that works.

Proprietary & Confidential | 16 CITYBLOCK

Without trust, tech falls flat.
Without tech, we can't deliver
**high-touch, personalized care**
to everyone who needs it.

Real healthcare transformation
will happen when tech is built
to **augment and scale trusting,**
**person-to-person relationships**
that solve real, complex problems.

## Slide 17: The pandemic is accelerating health tech trends and is changing healthcare for underserved communities forever

Proprietary & Confidential | 17 CITYBLOCK

*   **Our members need integrated care, and they need it in the home**
    The populations we serve are frail, sick, low-income, and disproportionately burdened by COVID-19. This group will continue to receive care at home until a vaccine is developed, which will drive a long-term shift healthcare access -- at least half of primary care will be delivered digitally and in person at home, forever.
*   **Telehealth usage is exploding, and it is here to stay**
    Social distancing has fast-forwarded market fit for virtual modalities: utilization of telehealth has increased 200% week over week in the last months as millions of Americans have their first telehealth visit. Virtual modalities are here to stay, not as point solutions, but smoothly integrated with in-home escalation.
*   **Consumers will vote with their feet, seeking new ways of consuming healthcare**
    This consumerization of healthcare is coming; Medicaid needs an option. This is when big brands are made and when customer loyalty is cemented. It's time that we show what healthcare should look like, and it's time to lean into the revolution in how care is delivered to populations who have been left behind.

## Slide 18: Cityblock is the only provider of scaled longitudinal relationships through deeply integrated virtual and home care

Proprietary & Confidential | 18 CITYBLOCK

**Only solution with seamless transition to/from our own in-home services.** Our team can meet members in the home. The result is continuity across modalities and a deeper trust layer with the member.

**Diversified capabilities.** Our model offers more than one vertical - we are underpinned by physical, behavioral, and social and will also include owned or partnered specialties such as maternity, palliative, rapid response, and DME that can be sold modularly

**Positioned for growth.** Rapidly expands member base to position for downstream risk sales post-COVID. Builds brand affinity with members at a time of peak need.

## Slide 19: Our technology enables 24/7 member front door and integrated primary care, escalating to home care from data-driven insights

Proprietary & Confidential | 19 CITYBLOCK

**MEMBER FRONT DOOR**
No wrong door for member communications (Cityblock app, SMS, phone, WhatsApp, video call) creates an always-available virtual front door to both immediate escalated response and true longitudinal primary care relationship with consistent care teams

**VIRTUAL INTEGRATED CARE**
High-quality care led by a centralized Cityblock team (CHPs, RNs, BH, MDs), with tight loops to triage escalation to in-home care and link to select specialty care partnerships (e.g., RubiconMD, Unite Us, tele-BH network providers, etc)

**HOME (AND FIELD) ESCALATED CARE DELIVERY**
High-intensity, team-based care delivered at the home (CHPs, RNs, NPs), including community rapid response for acute needs (MDs, NPs, paramedics) and select specialty partnerships (e.g., ESRD); quick transfers back to virtual care upon gap closures

**ROUTING & PRIORITIZATION** (connecting the three sections above)

**CENTRALIZED DEPLOYMENT ENGINE**
Commons remains the source of truth for all Cityblock care, maintaining member 360 view and seamlessly scaling up and down different modalities of care based on need. Serves as backbone for commodity digital health tools

Drives efficiency (message automation, routing, and deployment) while maintaining quality care and high-touch engagement

## Slide 28: The cumulative member journey culminates in significant value creation on a unit economic basis

Proprietary & Confidential | 28 CITYBLOCK

**Five Steps in Member Journey:**
1.  **Partner** with health plans
2.  **Find and engage** our member base
3.  **Plan** for their care (which expands capitation revenue)
4.  **Intervene & deliver** (which lowers external claims)
5.  **Scale** (repeat across successive cohorts)

**VALUE CREATION LEVERS**

*   We receive revenue for the full population at launch, helping fund operations
*   We take an acuity adjusted approach to **engagement**, prioritizing the members with the largest and most impactable spend
*   We are focusing on driving volume and **efficiency** in engagement and delivery
*   We are expanding our value capture (revenue creation) capabilities through proper **diagnosis capture**.
*   Initial investment investment in preventative care plans drives down **medical cost** for years to come, creating substantial LTV

*   Primary care
*   Behavioral health
*   Social care (CHP-led)

Amazon went from being a seller of books to owning the brand (e.g., Amazon Prime) and the infrastructure (e.g., fulfillment by Amazon, Amazon marketplace).
Drives competition and decentralization necessary for scaling in healthcare...
...And significantly diversified revenue

**Cityblock's Analogies:**
*   **Cityblock can directly provide care delivery, leveraging its strong consumer brand and unique integrated care model**
    [amazon Prime logo]
*   **Cityblock provides key infrastructure that wraps around a suite of networked care delivery providers**
    [fulfillment by amazon logo]
*   **Cityblock supports a "marketplace" of other care delivery providers, including those that compete with Cityblock, driving an ecosystem on its tech**

## Slide 38: Cityblock owns the consumer relationship, infrastructure, and risk; care delivery is modular and Cityblock-agnostic

*   **Payers unable to manage heterogeneous populations**
*   **Integrated entities** (e.g., ACOs) that struggle to **price risk**
*   Interest for multiple **payment mechanisms** (FFS+, PMPM fee, full risk)

## Slide 41: Summary

CITYBLOCK

*   Cityblock is the only full-stack healthcare provider and technology platform built for lower income communities.
*   Cityblock is on an exciting trajectory with significant market traction.
    *   We are on track - and contractually locked - to end 2020 with $415M of ARR, a 3.2x growth from January 2020.
    *   In 2020, we launching 2 new markets (MA in Q1, DC in Q4) and a virtual-first primary care business line to serve 53,000 members in New York (Q3).
    *   Existing markets continue to expand rapidly, with ~100% y/y growth in risk membership in our NY market in 2020.
    *   We have an additional $860MM+ revenue at maturity in high-probability pipeline.
*   Caring for low-income populations cost-effectively is difficult; most traditional health plans and providers struggle to engage these high-cost individuals. For most payers, 10% of members drive >60% of spend. Cityblock solves this challenge.
*   The total market opportunity is more than $1.2T. Very little investment has been made in this population. The switch to value based care and significant cost pressures faced by health plans create significant new market opportunity. COVID-19 is accelerating these trends.
*   Cityblock is a market-sought leader in caring for lower-income populations, especially Medicaid and Dual Eligibles.
    *   We offer deeply integrated virtual, home, and clinic based care, spanning the medical, behavioral, and social domains.
    *   Our investment in technology drives significant operational efficiencies in local markets & unlocks scale.
    *   We're the only team who can do this right. We have already operated the market-leading care models in this space.
*   We offer a highly differentiated consumer brand and experience that delivers results for our members.
    *   Engagement levels are 3-4x comparable peer set, and 8x plan baseline.
    *   Member NPS of 90 aligns with best-in-class consumer health brands and is unheard of in Medicaid.
    *   Strong utilization reduction trends and on-plan unit economics at best-in-market levels.

## Slide 42: [Closing Statement]

Proprietary & Confidential | 42 CITYBLOCK

Building healthier communities across the country requires local engagement and activism. It requires active anti-racism.

Solutions for the 1% simply do not work for lower income populations. We need all new ways of thinking.

Without trust, tech will fall flat. But without tech, we cannot truly scale.

Together, we will build lasting, effective care that all people deserve.
