### A Deeper Dive into Full Cycle Payment Integrity

Full Cycle Payment Integrity refers to the process of ensuring accurate and appropriate payment for healthcare services from provider bill submission to claims adjudication and payment.

The main challenges in Full Cycle Payment Integrity can vary depending on the specific healthcare system and context. Below we dive deeper into key drivers of a successful program that can be implemented along the stages of the claim process. Integrating all of these drivers into payment integrity governance can accelerate success.

Prepay
Prepay solutions are the first stop in the cycle. They enhance payment integrity by proactively identifying errors and inconsistencies before claims are processed.

Full Cycle Payment Integrity starts with identifying issues in claims before they are processed for payment. Below are 5 key strategies that can be incorporated into prepay:

1.  Rule-Based Edits
2.  Clinical and Coding Validation
3.  Customizable Edits
4.  Provider Collaboration
5.  AI Integration

1.  **Rule-Based Edits:** Solutions should offer automated application of predefined rules and edits on claims data to identify common errors and inconsistencies. These edits can check for correct coding, appropriate modifier usage, coverage verification, and compliance with bundling and unbundling rules.
2.  **Clinical and Coding Validation:** Solutions should incorporate all industry-standard coding guidelines governing CPT codes, HCPCS codes, and ICD codes; and validate claims against guidelines to ensure accurate coding and billing. Clinical validation provides a deeper analysis that combines coding, documentation, and clinical chart reviews to reveal higher-value errors.
3.  **Customizable Edits:** Technology solutions allow payers to customize and define specific edits based on their policies, reimbursement rules, and regulatory requirements. This ensures that claims are compliant with payer-specific guidelines.
4.  **Provider Collaboration:** Offering educational resources and training programs to providers improves their understanding of payment integrity requirements. Solutions should be developed that address provider coding questions, clarify documentation requirements, and resolve potential issues before billing submission.
5.  **AI Integration:** AI solutions automatically review claims, apply coding guidelines, and detect potential errors or anomalies to reduce the burden of manual reviewers and enhance accuracy. Prepay should incorporate the integration of AI automation to improve efficiency and effectiveness.

The evolution of prepay practices has been influenced by several factors including rising cost of care, advancements in analytics, regulatory reforms like surprise billing, focus on value-based care, increased capabilities, technology solutions fostering data sharing and collaboration with providers, and AI. Prepay is the primary building block of Full Cycle Payment Integrity.

Post Pay
Strong, well-rounded payment integrity offerings combine post pay solutions with prepay solutions to optimize accurate reimbursement at different stages of the reimbursement process.

With prepay methods in place to prevent errors, post pay methods complement efforts by identifying and addressing errors retrospectively. With a retrospective lens, several additional data points can be garnered. Payers can leverage complete claims data, and a more comprehensive dataset allows a more thorough review and analysis of claims.

There are many ways to improve accuracy after claims have been paid and 5 of the key foundational areas that reinforce Full Cycle Payment Integrity include the following:

1.  Claim Auditing
2.  Data Mining
3.  COB
4.  Subrogation
5.  Overpayment Recovery

1.  **Claim Auditing:** Validation solutions should occur in both prepay and post pay. Post pay solutions retrospectively assess accuracy and compliance with a detailed examination of paid claims data, documentation, and supporting information that can further identify errors.
2.  **Data Mining:** Data mining analyzes large volumes of claims data to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies. Data mining workflows should be continuously assessed and optimized. This may involve refining the error detection techniques or implementing preventive measures to minimize future errors.
3.  **Coordination of Benefits (COB):** COB ensures multiple coverage for the same individual do not collectively pay more than the total allowable expenses for the healthcare services rendered. COB prevents overpayment and duplication of benefits.
4.  **Subrogation:** Subrogation requires reimbursement from responsible third parties in cases of personal injury or liability claims. It allows the payer to recover funds, reduce financial burden, and maintain payment integrity.
5.  **Overpayment Recovery:** Once payment errors or overpayments are identified through post-payment methods, the process of recouping the overpaid amounts from the provider is important and should be consistent.

By retrospectively reviewing data trends, implementing automation where possible, establishing clear metrics and protocols, using feedback mechanisms, and collaborating with providers, payers can continuously improve their post pay strategy and ensure the most accurate payments in the changing healthcare environment. Data gathered in post pay is an important part of the feedback loop that can be applied in the prepay stage as well. It is important to continually enhance prepay solutions based on post pay data to stop as many errors as possible upstream in the cycle.

Analysis
Data analysis from various sources, such as claims, medical records, and payment data, can be applied in several ways to enhance Full Cycle Payment Integrity. Below are 5 key applications for analysis:

1.  Anomaly Detection
2.  Provider Profiling
3.  Comparative Analysis
4.  Claim Compliance
5.  Data Integration

1.  **Anomaly Detection:** Advanced analytics like AI, machine learning, and predictive modeling highlight anomalies indicative of waste. By applying findings from these data protocols, payers can proactively flag suspicious billing patterns for further investigation. Payers can also identify emerging risks by addressing potential errors.
2.  **Provider Billing Patterns:** Data analysis can be used to create provider billing patterns based on various metrics such as billing patterns, coding accuracy, utilization rates, and outlier identification. By comparing providers against benchmarks and norms, payers can identify providers who deviate from established patterns. This allows targeted education, audits, and interventions to improve payment integrity.
3.  **Comparative Analysis:** Comparative analysis involves comparing claims and payment patterns across regions, or time periods. This type of analysis can uncover variations, outliers, or discrepancies that support the identification of billing errors, inconsistencies, or unusual utilization.
4.  **Claims Compliance:** Data analysis can verify the accuracy and compliance of claims with coding guidelines, medical policies, and reimbursement rules. By assessing claims against established criteria, payers can identify errors, missing information, and inappropriate coding, allowing for appropriate payment adjustments and improved compliance. Claim compliance analysis can also identify specific types of claims prone to errors and implement targeted interventions, such as provider education, system enhancements, or process improvements to reduce errors.
5.  **Data Integration:** Integrating data from multiple sources, such as claims, EHRs, and external databases enables cross-referencing and validation. For example, payer data can be compared against provider-submitted data or external databases to identify discrepancies or inconsistencies in billing or patient information.

By leveraging multiple data analysis techniques, payers can gain valuable insights into claims, payment patterns, and provider behavior, enabling them to make informed decisions. Using focused analyses as part of Full Cycle Payment Integrity determines where enhancements to existing prepay or post pay solutions can be made. These strategies support the optimization of resources, error prevention strategies, and payment policy updates.
