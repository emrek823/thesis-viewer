### Changes in Diagnostics Landscape

- Lab Developed Test (LDT) regulations - FDA planning to regulate LDTs no longer happening, blessing this lab model permanently
- Abbott acquiring Exact Sciences validation - oil and water mixing but intentional move to expand capabilities beyond kits into lab revenue streams
- M&A heating up in diagnostics space moving from niche to mainstream
- Total Addressable Markets (TAMs) around $20 billion each across different diagnostic areas
	- Collective TAM approximately $100 billion
	- Current players capturing only 5-10% of addressable market

### Emerging Diagnostic Technologies and Models

- Tracer DX approach - decent stock position, advising company
	- Runs esoteric NGS test (landmark test) off patient tissue initially
	- Later uses PCR with per-patient PCR test pulled down for each tracking
	- Two key changes happening:
- Cloud-based testing model emerging
	- LDT freedom allows “I don’t need a lab” approach
	- Any path lab with sequencing capability can run test and send data up
	- Creates distributed MRD (minimal residual disease) testing network

### Proteomics as Next Frontier

- Easy answer for what’s next: proteomics focus
	- Cancer remains primary application where DNA sequencing provides meaningful medical insights
	- DNA sequencing scientifically interesting but medically limiting outside cancer applications
- Multi-omics term too vague to be useful from engineering perspective
- Proteomics fundamentally makes more sense
	- OLink acquisition by Thermo for $3 billion validates market
	- Illumina acquiring proteomics prep solution from startup company
- Technology evolution in proteomics:
- Superior business model potential
	- Proteins change constantly vs. DNA “once and done”
	- Captures comprehensive medical information
	- Regular testing cadence (weekly/monthly/yearly)
- Current state challenges
	- Nautilus and similar companies technologically missing the mark
	- Good trade-off between cost and information not yet found
	- OLink-style technology proven to work
	- Real protein sequencing still “mysterious end state”

### Personal Health Data and Market Opportunities

- Illumina executive health program experience (2010-present)
	- Annual $3,000 health exams, 15 years of detailed blood data
	- Regular analysis using advanced LLMs for pattern recognition
- Function Health vs. traditional approach
	- Function spends heavily on customer acquisition
	- Traditional reimbursed testing ($500 vs. Function’s pricing)
	- Question about data utilization and output differentiation
- Proteomics data opportunity
	- Current cost: tens of dollars per sample
	- Major gap: nobody knows what to do with proteomics data
	- Potential startup opportunity: “How do I spin this machine up” for proteomics data collection and analysis
	- Changes constantly, creating recurring revenue model
	- Could differentiate from Function Health approach

### Lab Automation and AI Integration

- Seed-round company doing lab automation
	- Robotics (not humanoid, robotic arm) plus AI/LLMs
	- Automating clinical life science lab modules
	- Targeting sequencer operation complexity (wells shuffling, etc.)
	- Second startup for founder
	- Based at New York Genome Center
	- Pre-seed phase in investor’s accelerator lab

### Drug Discovery AI Challenges

- Value proposition still unclear in AI-driven drug discovery
	- Drug companies don’t know what they want
	- No AI-driven drug companies yet successful at scale
	- Piecemeal AI solutions within organizations haven’t found clear utility
	- Remains unsolved problem in the industry
