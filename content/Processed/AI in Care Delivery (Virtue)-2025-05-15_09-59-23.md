### Fund Overview & Strategy

- Only tech-focused investor at the fund
- Regular quarterly dialogues with other healthcare investors
- Non-competitive relationship with other VCs due to different investment focus

	- Tech stack noted as only one year old

### AI Implementation Observations

- Mandolin working with Horizon infusion

	- Resistance to “red zone” applications (e.g., AI calling referring providers)
- Valerie Health pilot with USHV
	- Reduced FTEs needed for referral process from 4 to 2
- Computer Use applications showing promise in EMR integration
	- Particularly effective for difficult integrations like Flatiron
	- Companies like Luminai demonstrating impressive EMR navigation capabilities

### Market Trends & Opportunities

- Josh Kushner/Thrive Capital insights
	- Buying and AI-retrofitting accounting firms
	- Reporting 700 basis point EBITDA improvement
- Healthcare AI adoption varying by implementation area
	- Strong acceptance in administrative tasks
	- Resistance in direct provider communication
- Integration challenges remain significant

	- Bidirectional integration still problematic

### Next Steps
