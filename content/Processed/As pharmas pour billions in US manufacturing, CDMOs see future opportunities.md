## As phar­mas pour bil­lions in US man­u­fac­tur­ing, CD­MOs see fu­ture op­por­tu­ni­ties

CD­MO ex­ec­u­tives say they are un­fazed about the wave of phar­ma com­pa­nies boost­ing their in­ter­nal man­u­fac­tur­ing ca­pac­i­ty as they on­shore to the US, not­ing this could have up­sides for third-par­ty ser­vice providers in the fu­ture.

*End­points News* spoke with CEOs on the side­lines of the Con­ven­tion on Phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal In­gre­di­ents con­fab in Frank­furt, who said that phar­ma com­pa­nies may be over­in­vest­ing in their US foot­print, which could pro­vide ac­qui­si­tion op­por­tu­ni­ties for CD­MOs in the fu­ture.

Since ear­ly this year, over $480 bil­lion in in­vest­ments have been pledged to the US as Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump con­tin­ues to threat­en phar­ma-spe­cif­ic tar­iffs. Most re­cent­ly, Trump warned com­pa­nies that they need­ed to start break­ing ground in the US or face 100% tar­iffs, caus­ing them to [rush to start con­struc­tion](https://endpoints.news/drugmakers-push-to-break-ground-after-trumps-100-tariff-threat/).

But CD­MOs are skep­ti­cal whether phar­ma com­pa­nies will ful­fill their grand ex­pan­sion promis­es.

Al­lo­cat­ing an amount for ex­pand­ing man­u­fac­tur­ing is a part of phar­ma’s nor­mal busi­ness strat­e­gy, but giv­en the geopo­lit­i­cal sit­u­a­tion, they are prompt­ed to do these promis­es more than usu­al, Fu­ji­film Biotech­nolo­gies CEO Lars Pe­tersen said.

Al­so, in cer­tain cas­es, the sum of new in­vest­ment is ac­tu­al­ly much small­er than what their press re­leas­es say, Pe­tersen added. For ex­am­ple, when Eli Lil­ly an­nounced its $50 bil­lion com­mit­ment to the US in Feb­ru­ary, on­ly [$27 bil­lion](https://endpoints.news/lilly-says-it-will-invest-27b-into-us-drug-manufacturing/) was new fund­ing.

Even if phar­ma com­pa­nies do meet the full ex­tent of their pledges, they could find them­selves with too much ca­pac­i­ty down the line, Re­ci­pharm CEO Greg Be­har said. “I can bet you my good mon­ey that in 10 years from now, 75% of that will be for sale,” Be­har added.

It’s not un­usu­al for phar­ma to di­vest its fac­to­ries. Bris­tol My­ers Squibb [sold](https://www.rovi.es/en/content/rovi-announces-acquisition-injectable-drug-product-manufacturing-site-phoenix-arizona-usa) a US fa­cil­i­ty to Span­ish CD­MO Rovi last month, and Sanofi [sold](https://endpoints.news/thermo-fisher-buys-sanofi-factory-amphastar-pharma-quadruples-hq-capacity/) a fac­to­ry to Ther­mo Fish­er in Ju­ly. Last Oc­to­ber, Lon­za [com­plet­ed](https://www.lonza.com/news/2024-10-01-16-45) its ac­qui­si­tion of a fa­cil­i­ty from Roche, which is now [a key part](https://endpoints.news/lonza-expects-more-cdmo-contracts-galdermas-650m-us-commitment/) of Lon­za’s man­u­fac­tur­ing port­fo­lio.

A ma­jor­i­ty of the new builds are al­so for spe­cif­ic new drugs, like weight loss med­ica­tions, and so there’s still de­mand for third-par­ty man­u­fac­tur­ers for the rest of phar­ma com­pa­ny pipelines, Pe­tersen added. “That means they will in­vest even less in the things that CD­MOs do, and they will need us more,” Be­har said.

[Eli Lil­ly](https://endpoints.news/lilly-earmarks-3b-for-new-european-obesity-pill-factory/), for in­stance, has re­cent­ly an­nounced that a [$6.5 bil­lion](https://endpoints.news/lilly-sets-aside-6-5b-for-new-texas-site-to-make-its-obesity-pill/) site in Texas will make its oral GLP-1 pill. [As­traZeneca](https://endpoints.news/astrazeneca-breaks-ground-on-virginia-plant-after-trump-warns-drugmakers-to-build-or-face-tariffs/) broke ground on a new site in Vir­ginia that will al­so make drug sub­stances for its oral GLP-1 as­sets, as well as AD­Cs.

Nonethe­less, even with the mas­sive ef­fort by phar­ma to boost in­ter­nal pro­duc­tion, there will still be de­mand for CD­MOs from small­er and mid-sized biotech com­pa­nies that might not have the ca­pac­i­ty to make drugs for the mar­ket, Siegfried CEO Mar­cel Imwinkel­ried said. “For small mol­e­cules, 80% of the nor­mal drugs, which are ap­proved by the FDA, come from small­er com­pa­nies,” he added.
