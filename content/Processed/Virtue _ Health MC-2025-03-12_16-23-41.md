### Financing Dynamics

- Everyone aligned on financing terms
- Equity round, using SAFE instruments
- Judah considering 3-4M on 30M post-money valuation
- Minimum of 30M post-money valuation agreed upon
- Option to take up to 4M, potentially at slightly higher valuation
- 10% ESOP to be included
- Considering price equity to clean up all SAFEs
- Control terms: Judah to maintain control; discussing board composition

### Credo Partnership

- History: Connected through Vivek (ChartFast owner), introduced by Nick Hyde
- Credo’s focus: Diagnosis suspecting and provider tools
- Credo’s gap: Limited understanding of retrospective process, file creation, and AI deployment
- PCC (test partner) engagement:
	- Initial pilot: Low signal-to-noise ratio (1 usable chart per 10 sent)
	- Second pilot: 100 members, achieved 0.05-0.07 lift
	- Potential expansion: 12,000 Humana lives, 7-9 payers total
	- Logan (PCC COO) enthusiastic about results
- Credo’s market traction:
	- Pitched retrospective process to 5 customers recently
	- Targeting April 1st for larger project start
- Pricing model: $30 per patient, $6 per chart (if more than 5 charts)
- Potential contract value: $400,000 - $700,000 (error bars included)

### Pearl Partnership

- Current situation:
	- Pursuing ~$1M worth of total charts
	- Initially offering 25% of charts to HealthMC, with potential to increase
- Datavant involvement:
	- Brought in to derisk the project
	- More expensive solution (requires review of all codes)
	- Pearl prefers HealthMC for cost-effectiveness and EMR export capabilities
- Prospective opportunities:
	- Pearl interested in HealthMC’s algorithmic capabilities
	- Potential for white-labeling or revenue sharing arrangements

### Credo Relationship and Provider Pull

- Potential competitive aspects acknowledged
- HealthMC’s focus: Payer workflow, less interested in provider work
- Credo’s focus: Provider workflow
- Discussing potential rev-share arrangements for customer introductions
- HealthMC sees advantage in algorithmic capabilities

### Payer Contracts

- Focusing on retrospective work initially
- Exploring concurrent and prospective opportunities
- Considering high-trust certifications for expanded capabilities
- Leveraging Credo and PCC success for marketing to other payers

### Biggest Risks

- Rapid growth leading to capital constraints
- Potential need for extensive human review processes
- Scaling challenges with coding staff management
- Product priorities: Lowering internal labor costs, improving efficiency

### Sales Strategy

- Initial push through network connections and LinkedIn outreach
- Inbound interest increasing, especially through partnerships
- Planning to improve marketing materials and professionalism
- Considering more aggressive pricing models (e.g., percentage-based) for high-value contracts

### Product Development

- Focus on optimizing processes to reduce labor costs
- Exploring AI-driven efficiencies in chart review and coding
- Investigating high-trust certifications for expanded capabilities
- Balancing product development with go-to-market strategies
