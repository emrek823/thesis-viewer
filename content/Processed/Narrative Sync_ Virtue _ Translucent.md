### Company Strategy & Messaging

- Going live today on multiple use cases
- Act 1-3 framework evolution
	- Act 1: Medical groups (bottom left quadrant)
	- Act 3: Health systems (top right quadrant)
	- Only need 10-20 health systems to reach $20-40M revenue
	- 40 health systems required to reach $100M
- Positioning refinement needed
	- Started broad horizontal with multiple agents across use cases
	- Using application layer wedge to drive deeper, become system of record
	- Focus on horizontal then vertical expansion strategy

### ROI & Competitive Advantage

- Automating processes should drive margin improvement directly
- Bringing top 1% operating margins to all customers
	- HCA as public benchmark example
- Structured data focus differentiates from portfolio companies
- First mover advantage in FP&A bucket
	- Rubicon evaluation: 5 vendors in prior auth, 5 in coding, only 1 (Translucent) in FP&A
- UT Southwestern example validates approach

### Technical Infrastructure & Platform

- Semantic layer provides unique tribal knowledge consolidation
	- Defines weighted RVU calculations and industry nuances
- Infrastructure ownership creates defensibility
	- Orchestration layer controls data flow
	- 100% accuracy required for financial workflows
- Platform foundation built over 12-18 months before raising
	- Similar to Smart DX development timeline
	- Contrasts with voice AI companies raising without platform sophistication
