Given these risks, uncertainties and other factors, you should not place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements. In addition, such statements were not prepared with a view to public disclosure or compliance with published guidelines of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants or U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

## Slide 12: We Are THE Voice Leading the Home Care Industry Evolution

## We Are THE Voice Leading the Home Care Industry Evolution

### THE WALL STREET JOURNAL.
**Caregiver Turnover Strains Households**
January 22, 2023

“Some home care companies have adopted technology to help provide consistent scheduling and care. Jisella Dolan, chief advocacy officer for Home Instead, which has 1,200 home-care franchises around the world, says the company uses a technology platform that coordinates scheduling and allows family members, using a downloaded app, to see who is coming each day, when, and if there are any changes.

Home Instead, which is a subsidiary of Honor Technology Inc., doesn't guarantee it will find replacements if a scheduled worker isn't available, but it strives to do so, she says. Home Instead also has training for those working with Clients who have special conditions such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease."

## Slide 35: 4 For Admin Team: Leveraging Tech Capabilities to Accelerate and Automate Workstreams

## 4 For Admin Team: Leveraging Tech Capabilities to Accelerate and Automate Workstreams

### Accelerate: Allow operations teams to work more efficiently

**Example:** enabling better care pro / Client matches based on data insights
*   **Technology:** ML-powered matching system provides recommendations about the best Client / Care Pro fit
*   **Human:** Honor team finalizes matches in consultation with partner agency to ensure strong fit
*   **Outcomes:** Top quartile ML-recommended matches are 200% more likely to reach 4-week relationship length than bottom quartile

(Table: Recommended Care Pro, showing Rank, Rel, Region, Ongoing, Interest, Notes Availability for various Care Pros)

### Automate: Make the machines do the work, not the humans

**Example:** reduce manual effort to prep Care Pros and review performance
*   **What:** Prompt Care Pros to check app for updates to existing Clients with status tracking to confirm review is completed
*   **Why:** Better care quality via more consistent prep for Care Pros AND reduce manual outreach from operations team
*   **Outcomes:** Improved Care Pro task completion rates and 60% reduction in manual outreach

(Mobile App Mockup: "Updates to care" with "Review the following updates to Arlette's care and mark as read.")
*   **Client summary:** Medical conditions (Heart disease, Mild cognitive impairment), Memory conditions (Mild dementia)

## In Summary: Technology Allows Honor to Create Better Experiences Across the Home Care Ecosystem

### Example: Reduced call-off rate to improve Care Pro & Client experience

By appointment date, percentage of shifts called off
(Line chart showing call-off rates from June to April)

*   **Y-axis:** 0.0% to 16.0%
*   **X-axis:** June to April (over roughly a year period, with Feb 2020 marked)
*   **Percent 7 Day Call Offs (Orange Line):** Starts around 12-14%, drops significantly after Feb 2020.
*   **Percent 24 Hour Call Offs (Blue Line):** Starts around 4-6%, drops significantly after Feb 2020.

*   In Feb 2020, new features in Care Pro app reduced:
    *   — 7-day call-offs from **11% to 5.5%** and
    *   — 24-hour call-offs from **5.5% to 2%**

### Positive Effects Across the Continuum
*   **✓ Care Recipient:** Less worry about their Care Pro not showing up
*   **✓ Recipient's Family:** Does not need to worry about a Care Pro not being able to assist their Recipient
*   **✓ Agency:** More reliability on Care Pros
*   **✓ Care Pro:** Better engagement and improved trust with Care Recipient

## Slide 44: 3 International Expansion: Pursue Honor's Position as the Global Leader in Home Care

## 3 International Expansion: Pursue Honor's Position as the Global Leader in Home Care

### International Growth Strategy
*   \> Seek to expand into 1-2 new countries per year through franchise acquisitions
    *   – $5-10M franchise acquisition cost for new market (based on network size)
    *   – Revenue generated through royalties from franchise agencies with ~100% gross margin
    *   – Remain highly opportunistic and disciplined in our approach
*   \> Build on UK leadership position through O&O and/or acquisitions of adjacent home-care businesses
    *   – Expand O&O blueprint across UK to increase revenue recognition as compelling opportunities arise
*   \> Continue expansion in existing APAC territories (e.g., Japan, Australia, New Zealand and Singapore)
*   \> Long-term goal to convert international franchises onto Care Platform
*   \> Explore technology investments to accelerate platform roll-out in international markets

### Global Expansion Opportunities Across Europe and Other High-Income Countries (Map)

## Slide 45: 4 Grow Owned & Operated Presence in U.S. Market

## 4 Grow Owned & Operated Presence in U.S. Market

### O&O Expansion Strategy and Rationale
*   ■ Seek to grow new O&O acquisitions by up to an additional ~$20M ARR with excess capital
*   ■ Disciplined approach to O&O acquisitions
    *   — Transact at compelling valuation multiples
    *   — Prioritize growth, minimal stabilization periods, and serviceability on Care Platform
*   ■ Use O&O acquisitions as a strategic tool to enhance network and Care Platform synergies
    *   — Agencies can be acquired within (i.e., HCN, HI on CP) or outside (HI off Platform, independent agencies) of the current Care Platform network
    *   — O&O can be used to drive towards scale and density on Care Platform in certain MSAs

## Slide 53: High Confidence in Ability to Convert $85M ARR in 2023 and $140M ARR in 2024

## High Confidence in Ability to Convert $85M ARR in 2023 and $140M ARR in 2024

Across conversions and O&O, objective is to optimize for density, limited stabilization period, strong unit economics and high likelihood for growth

### 2023 ($ in millions)
(Bar chart showing conversion targets)
*   **HI Conversion:** $75M
*   **O&O:** $10M (with $3-$5 capital required)
*   **Total:** $85M

### 2024 ($ in millions)
(Bar chart showing conversion targets)
*   **HI Conversion:** $120M
*   **O&O:** $20M (with $6-$10 capital required)
*   **Total:** $140M

---

**Strong Conviction in Visionary 3 (V3) conversions**
*   ■ Highly compelling offer package and all benefits that come with being on Care Platform
*   ■ Outstanding performance of recent Visionary 2 (V2) cohorts
*   ■ In 2022, We targeted $50M of total ARR to convert onto the platform based on our implementation capacity. Identified $138M of ARR for potential conversion opportunities based on market accessibility, requiring a 36% yield. Achieved 100% of goal (Oversubscribed after 2 months)
*   ■ In 2023, we are targeting $75M of ARR conversion to the platform based on our expanded implementation capacity. Identified $425M of potential conversion opportunities (requiring only an 18% yield to achieve full capacity)
*   ■ V3 targeted agencies are a better fit for Care Platform than V1 or V2 based on portfolio mix
*   ■ High interest from agencies – implementation capacity most likely to continue to be limiter of ARR conversions
