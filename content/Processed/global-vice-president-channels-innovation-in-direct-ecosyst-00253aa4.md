**Q: How many years of experience do you have in the healthcare payment solutions industry competing against companies like Cotiviti? What products or business units did you primarily focus on?**

A: I've got about 12 years in healthcare and other kind of payment solutions, mostly on the payer side and on the vendor side. For a good chunk of that, we were working directly with Cotiviti and one of their top three rivals. So I am aware of Cotiviti in-depth.

**Q: Can you speak about Cotiviti and its relative position in the healthcare payment technology solutions competitive landscape?**

A: IMO, Cotiviti is comfortably one of the top two players in the payment integrity market. They have massive scale and their renewals are always 78% or higher and a huge chunk of the national carriers use at least one of their solutions. Their closest competitors i consider are Optum's Payment Integrity business, Veracity, Zelis in some overlap areas, and then in a small fashion I think it is MultiPlan, ClarisHealth, SAS/Veracity ID, etc.

**Q: How does Cotiviti differentiate itself from its competitors in the healthcare payment integrity technology solutions industry?**

A: Cotiviti's real differentiation bis their depth and accuracy of their clinical claims editing, the fact that they've been doing this longer than almost anyone so their concept library is enormous and continuously updated, and also that they've built a true end-to-end platform – pre-pay, post-pay, COB, FWA, provider engagement portal - so payers can consolidate vendors with them more easily than with most competitors.

**Q: Why would customers choose Cotiviti vs. competitors for healthcare payment integrity technology solutions?**

A: Customers like us prefer and then pick Cotiviti when they want the highest ROI and the lowest provider abrasion risk. Their edits tend to have the best accuracy rates in the industry and most payers recover more dollars with fewer overturned claims and less friction from hospitals and large groups. Also, a lot of plans just don't want to stitch together three or four point solutions when Cotiviti can cover 60% of the opportunity with one contract.

**Q: What areas of the healthcare technology solutions industry can you speak most in depth about?**

A: I am most knowledgeable in payment integrity overall – claims editing DRG & clinical validation, coordination of benefits, fraud/waste/abuse analytics, provider outreach & dispute workflows, and the vendor consolidation trends among payers.

you share a brief overview of your background?

### Expert
Yeah. I've been in the technology space for a while, and the reason I'm so much involved in this business, in the technology space, more importantly I also have a background as a medical doctor a long time ago, which I never pursued and got going. I have that naturally I'm shoved into all of these projects, which give me an advantage into understanding the healthcare plans that we have in the space that we have. I can bring expertise from that perspective, from more of a healthcare perspective, but also from a technology perspective. That's really the combination that I have.

### Client
Terrific. What is your interaction or involvement been with Cotiviti?

### Expert
Yeah. Multiple. I've known them for almost a decade and on different aspects. We work also with all the integrations that they do with like TriZetto, Epic, Cerner and many other aspects of integration that they are involved in. That's number one.

Secondly, we work with multiple of their clients. I'm involved with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Idaho, Blue Cross Blue Shield of California, Texas, Department of Veterans Affairs, where we are either implementing them, or actually going out and working on the technology to extend them or also ensuring that we actually provide technology to them for data analytics, especially for a lot of the things that are required for them for automation, execution, and basically what we call as event orchestration for the technology that they have. I know one of the questions you asked is like what their forward-looking focus is and so on. In that respect, I can talk a little bit about that as well.

### Client
What is the most important topic to zero in on when thinking about their future? Is it partnerships? Is it the nature of the relationships with marquee customers? Is it something unique about their solutions? What do you think?

### Expert
In my perspective, as you're well aware, the world is revolving around all of this agentic AI and artificial intelligence and automation and orchestration. It's that aspect of it. It's really the core I think is the AI and payment integrity. That's really core. The second you're pointing towards is the interoperability and data exchange. Basically, that is a key aspect, right. For the technology to work, could it be to work they really need an ecosystem that they need to work with. Whether all these EMR systems, or technology systems, and so on, and so on. It's really a combination of these two that is out there.

In addition to that, as you know, there is a lot of government pressure, especially with a new government that has come in. As you know, the whole government shutdown that took place for 40+ days and so on is all around the healthcare the regulatory shifts and the costs of healthcare and so on are exponentially rising. Given that, I feel that creativity is in the middle of a storm. In a good way. In my perspective, I feel that is going to help it move forward. Those are all the important factors I take forward. The AI and tech boom, the regulatory shift that are occurring, and the interoperability and direction. Those are the three major things in my perspective.

### Client
That being at the epicenter of all that, is there anything that makes Cotiviti unique relative to competitors?

### Expert
Yeah. I think what makes it unique is multiple things. First of all, it is about the core of what they do. The core of their platform is focused on payment integrity. Basically, the whole focus around, for me, it's a payment integrity. Of course, it is also focused on the consumer engagement, and seamless integration with

their core system. I think those key things, if you take a look at some of the competition, which I'll talk a little bit about.

Their integration with the payer core systems, the electronic health record systems, the electronic management systems like Epic and so on is really what makes them super unique into what they have. Again, the other thing that gives them a lot of credibility is that the fact they're being a very long time player in this market, a very strong player in this market, and they are trusted by some of the larges, if I talk about references that they need, the who's is who is using them by far. For example, we're working with the Department of Veterans Affairs right now. You can't get any bigger than that as an example in my view.

### Client
Okay. To what extent are they at the right place in time with all of this change where they have some leadership position that accelerates their competitive positioning? Does that exist or not? Maybe I'm just imagining something.

### Expert
Again, I could be biased because I've known them for a decade. Of course, I know some of their competitors. Like I mentioned to you, we have had an opportunity to work with some of the competitors, and some of those competitors that I'm talking about, the biggest one, if I were to say, what is that real differentiation with their competitor? I would say it is A) when customers pick up productivity, most of them want the highest return on investment and the lowest provider risk that they have. I think having a platform that addresses that, and how they process their payments is really, as you're well aware.

If I buy any software, let's imagine I buy a database, the first thing that I do when I'm evaluating the database is really if somebody is asking me, "Hey, pay me a $10 million." I'm looking at that and saying, "Okay, for $10 million, what is my return on this investment?" That's the number one thing most companies look for. I think with a product like Cotiviti the return on investment is so simple to prove, because if you save $100 million, let's imagine and you're paying them $25 million, that's like a drop in the bucket of like what you're doing. That is one of the key thing if you ask me.

What makes them different and how are they going to differentiate themselves? I think that is the easiest way they can differentiate themselves. Now the closest competitor is a company, I'm not sure if you're aware of them, called Optum. I think Optum itself also has a pretty good track record and a pretty good focus in this business. I feel a top in the rivals that they have have is really their payment systems on the payer side and on the vendor side is unmatched in my view. Again, I could be biased because of the fact that I work with them the longest and a lot of end results that have been successful.

### Client
What about the progress of the last few months or last year, has anything changed in terms of being unmatched?

### Expert
Yeah. I think a couple things that have changed. Not only one thing that has changed. They did a recent acquisition, and I can't remember who it was because I'm not paying attention to that part of it. I think if I were to look at what has happened is key thing. It is A) that they have more than any of the competitors, and this I can say it strongly because we did an evaluation probably February, so it's almost 10 months ago. I know the company because we were looking at this. It's the Edifecs acquisition that they did. That was right around the time in that February.

I think it has combined that what we are calling as natural language processing enable coding and data standardization into their analytics platform. What makes them stand out is really adopting to these new technology changes, which I feel is a massive advantage for them more than the competition. It is really embedding for diagnosis coding to make it easy analytics that they've embedded in the end-to-end workflow for what they believe is their payment integrity system, I think is a massive differentiator in my view at least. I don't think any of the competition has. If I were to bet on this company, then I think I would bet on the technology that they have.

Actually, they have advanced technology, really good data analytics, and they have specialized expertise. If I were to take a look at the combination that I just mentioned, those are the three things that stand out in my view, or what makes them stand on that number one part of the pedestrian.

### Client
In terms of adopting or adapting to new technological changes, being a major or massive advantage for them, I think was the phrase you used. What gives you conviction in that? Anything specific in terms of a feature or function or the culture of the people or pace of innovation.

### Expert
Yeah. I can give you a very specific example. What gives me real conviction is really them investing in the core technologies. What do I mean by that? Automating workflows. This has got to be key for what? I mentioned to you that one of the key differentiators that they have, and the key positives that they have is their interoperability and data exchange platforms that they have.

Now what they have done is the value that they're driving is automated all those workflows. For example, authorizations and gap closures and really cutting a huge bunch of administration costs through AI-driven normalization. People talk about AI left, right and center, but when you put it into a practice something of this nature, I think that's a major differentiator. Second thing. If you take a look at the second big thing is in basically claims processing.

The claims processing I think that there is a huge advantage that they're bringing in claims processing by actually showcasing some of the advanced, for example, if you take a look at the TriZetto assets, and then what they do in that with the prepay and the close of business processing, they have a massive advantage where they're we were able to show at least 5%-6% savings on just on the claims processing.

The second thing that I think is definitely important was like the Epic and Cerner. For example,, when we were talking about integration capabilities, and that the best benefit that they bought in was almost close to about a 90% accuracy, reducing the false positives even higher by like 30%. Again, does Optum do this? I don't know. Maybe they do it at this level, but I have never seen any other vendor like the Optum guys claim of these things. They are good at other things, but I'm not seeing them as dominant.

Ultimately, the measurable dollar savings justify something like this. It's very easy to justify something like this because of that. Let me add one more thing. I think the Cotiviti major strength it's really vendor neutral approach, allowing all of this consolidation. Integration covers and payment and so on and so on. If most of the payers, for example, use this Cotiviti API, and so you can actually shorten your like implementation times by weeks, on month where naturally this is where the money is for a lot of these payers and so and so. I think that another key differentiator that other vendors don't have.

### Client
Okay. Anything else when we look under the hood that that's unique.

### Expert
Yeah. I think the biggest nuance that is unique if I were to break this down, all of the artificial intelligence that they have put into the payment integrity systems, they have practical AI for like prepaying, post-paying, claim pattern validations, and then the Edifecs acquisition that they did now uses natural language processing and machine learning to cut all the false positives by almost like 40% I would say. I think that's a massive differentiator for them as the number one thing.

I keep talking about the acquisition that they did in the Edifecs. I think that is a really good acquisition because it's basically has AI-driven encounters reduced errors. I think a few years ago, or maybe three years ago, again some of this technology was not there, but I think this technology and their ongoing enhancements will continue. I'm pretty sure what I heard back in February when we had talked about our roadmap, they had even talked to us about in 2026, one of the major focuses they're going to put is on the payer provider portal. I think that is something that we're looking for.

You ask me like what makes them different? What like continues to bring them a differentiator in 2026? I think that's something we're looking for as they continue doing what they're doing. The value-based provider tools that they will give, and the advancements that they will have in data analytics, these are all, for us, massive differentiators. You did ask me about is it their people? Is what they do, and so on? I think that's a major part of it as well. Some of the people that support us, or are able to basically have this conversation, they have many several really smart MDs on their staff. That actually do regular QBR.

With us, I think that level of attention, all of the proactive reach outs through the support systems, just ensuring that we have a clear view of their roadmap. As I mentioned, so we have like a yearly roadmap and a clear insight like not in almost in February of 2025, I was hearing what they were doing in 2026 already. All of those are also real positives.

### Client
Few things that I've read caught my attention and just wondered, what do you think, what is the real significance of some of this over 300 million members and patients through its payer and provider clients, while also offering retail sector data management and recovery audit services to optimize business outcomes? They talk about their solutions, preventing, and recovering $9.5 billion in payment waste annually as of 2024. They hold the CMS recovery audit contractor contracts. They've got 25 years consecutively of NCQA HEDIS certification. What's the significance of some of this? What comes to mind?

### Expert
Yeah. First of all, you're spot on, right. I didn't know it was that high. If I'm not mistaken, from what I knew it was more than like 200 and all of the major contract work and stuff that they do. It may be true that they have done that. Naturally, they have a long history which is like they've been formed many, many years ago. I think they're in the '80s, maybe mid-80s. They were formed, if I'm not mistaken. Maybe not. I'm not sure about that path.

I think the leadership that is there, the product portfolio where customers are actually engaging the innovation and IT and technology stack. You're right about the customer and verticals. I know that they have some retail, but I'm not honestly had opportunity to work on that. I work more on the payer side, so I'm more familiar with that for all of the things that they do on that site. I did hear about the other parts for what they do. Of course, for the outcomes and what they derive and what they do, I think there is definitely that.

The competitive landscape naturally is strong. If you were to ask me, would somebody acquire something like this as an example because they have so much scale and so on. As you know, Cognizant acquired, which has nothing to do with their business, or Oracle acquiring Cerner, which has nothing to do with their business, which brings the healthcare. I would say that something like that would probably be a good acquisition for somebody to do that as well.

If you were to ask me general questions about this. I'm sorry if I I don't know if there was a question. I I know you made some statements there. I don't know if you wanted me to validate, which I think I can validate some of them based on the knowledge that I have and others.

### Client
What comes to mind when thinking about the significance of some of this, some of the numbers are quite big. About $10 billion in payment waste has been avoided is what I'm reading. For a long time, it sounds like they've got this expertise that's maybe accumulated over time. I don't know how much of a moat that is. They've got scale, 300 million of these members and patients.

### Expert
First of all to answer your question. I'm throwing this out as a general because as I said, a health plan with like close to about two million members might pay them close to, again, between $25 million and $40 million a year in fees and because they get like a savings of like maybe $130, $140 million in savings.

For them to shell out $26, $27 million, it's like a no brainer because this is, if you take a look at your ROI, it's between 6X and 8X savings on just on the ROI. That you could pay. Like I told you, I was working with Blue

Cross Blue Shield of Idaho. It's a mid-sized company. I remember there they were paying close to about like around $3 million per year because they were getting easily a savings about like close to about $40 million using that software.

Again, is Cotiviti expensive in absolute dollars? Absolutely they are. If you take a look at what they have. I think that's a good thing because payers see them as one of the highest return on investments in their entire budget lines. Almost I don't see, many people don't leave it because the ROI is simply there. If I were to go to my board and ask for more money, it's just money that I gain any which way. What a beautiful solution to have. It's paying for itself almost 8X over. I would say you're absolutely right, but all the statements that you said, I validate that 100% because I've seen that firsthand myself.

### Client
Coming back to this acquisition, which you've already spoken a little bit about, and this is the one from March 2025, so very recent Edifecs. Something that I learned, I wondered what do you think in terms of the significance of this, and whether others can catch up and how much of an advantage is it?

What I'm reading is that this acquisition has positioned Cotiviti as the only provider offering fully integrated payment integrity, interoperability, and value-based care solutions at scale, creating a moat against both specialized interoperability vendors like Change Healthcare, and general enterprise technology providers like IBM. How big of a deal is that? How much of a moat will others catch up? Is this something really durable, or who knows what happens in a couple years with AI or something else? What do you think?

### Expert
In my view, it is the first more advantage that they have. I knew about Edifecs before the acquisition. Naturally, they were not a competitor, but I think they had like adding solutions to that. I think the Edifecs is just not a bolt on. I think it's a strategic powerhouse that addresses some of Cotiviti's EDIs. I've been mentioning about interoperability, data exchange, and value-based care.

I think like I mentioned to you, one of the things that Cotiviti is really good at, it was already a leader in payment integrity, right. Naturally, the numbers that you mentioned that the massive saving companies were getting, if I were to put all in all together, I think absolutely right. Of course, Edifecs itself is not like a company that was a start-up or anything like that. It has, I think, if I'm not mistaken, at least two decades of experience in healthcare data management and so on and so on. I think this combination absolutely accelerates Cotiviti's end-to-end platform, making it more cohesive for players who are looking at these things.

I think first of all, where does it help and will other people catch up? If I were to take a look at, can others catch up to this? Yes, they can. I think they easily can per se because technology today has just changed dramatically. There is a lot of aggressive M&A happening, and of course, AI investments are happening. For example, I go back to the number one rival, which is Optum. They are also doing a lot of work with AI enhanced change management systems, Change Healthcare systems and so on and so on.

I think the first mover advantage that Cotiviti has with Edifecs is great. I would say that if I was the CEO of Cotiviti, I would be looking back at Optum and Zelis posed the nearest near term threat. Why? I think that especially with the guys from what our friends from Optum have done, they have basically put like a lot of investments I hear. Again, I don't know much about that, but I know that they have put a lot of investments in machine learning and AI and so on and so on, which could erode some of Cotiviti share by 2027 if they continue to make a dent in their thing.

I think that Cotiviti's Edifecs fueled AI and interoperability edge buys them a lot of time. Remember what is happening in this market is that payers vendor consolidation trends. If you're a laggard, that is a risk for them. The competition like Zelis are expanding, and that could mean a specific rival in a particular market. I think the first mover in my view is a great start. I don't see Cotiviti sitting back and saying, "Okay, I think we got it. and we don't need to worry. I think they're always looking in the back mirror if I'm not mistaken, that's something that is a positive.

Okay. What are some drawbacks if I might? I'll wait. What are some challenges?

Yeah. What do you think?

### Expert
Cotiviti is like widely praised for its scale and accuracy and return on investment in payment integrity and so on and so on. That's like no brainer. One of the things that I've heard, now I'm not experienced this directly, but I work very closely with some of my colleagues and I've heard about inconsistent support and service quality. That means that some of the users are reporting.

I know the CIO, for example, in another Blue Cross really well, and he talks frequently with his team and he says that "Hey, there's a gap in our support, the promise of responsiveness is falling short. This is leading to delays in issue resolutions and so on." That's something that we are at that. I have not experienced, but I've heard multiple. We have these yearly meetups at the medical conference. That's really where I've heard about in these roundtables, where we talk about different technologies and so on. I've heard about Cotiviti's support staff not being the best. I see that.

I heard about also, and I've experienced some of this. I think this is something that I can give you, real world implementation. There are some implementation and setup challenges that we have seen. Onboarding can be complex due to Cotiviti's depth. I think what they have not done really well is when they have sold. I think they should have more of a customer success person embedded in the account. They have not done that I think as well. This has been one of my pet peeves, honestly, that a customer service person or a product success person needs to be embedded.

Especially in the integration of legacy, TriZetto systems like those kind of systems, where they are a non expert is not able to do this. They have to have some expertise in that. Initial setup requires like almost like I remember when we did this and Department of Veterans Affairs, it took like eight weeks, which was a lot of it. There we had a competitor also putting something together. There were two systems in parallel. Zelis was the other system. The Zelis implementation we did in like three weeks and Cotiviti took us almost eight weeks because of the complexity of what we had. That is definitely an issue that we had.

Another issue that I've heard about very commonly is the ROI realization. It takes much longer than needed. It's not like you plug and play it and boom, it's ready to go and everybody realizes like, "Oh my God, what an amazing solution. I can get the ROI." The ROI realization is there, but it's taking longer than people anticipate. I think that's something that is definitely a drawback.

Now the other thing that I've experienced myself, not in the past year, I would say probably two years ago, just as COVID was there and the demand for this software was at one of its peaks, maybe they were running really fast, really hard after or during the COVID period. The bugs, downtime, and inaccuracy in the tools like the Quality Intelligence tool, and the complaints that we were getting from the team, including documentation gaps, false positives and edits was much higher than anticipated. That created a little bit of a negative technical and reliability issues for us.

A lot of cleanup needed to be done during that. I heard so many complaints from the organization about quality intelligence not working, some of the documentation in Cotiviti's system that was lacking and so on. I don't know how their systems are. I've heard that hey use a lot of offshore resources, and because of that the accuracy of some of the documentation and the support is not the highest. Of course, every company is trying to save costs by rinse and repeating some of these things. That might not be working.

The other thing that I've heard frustrations about is the pricing and contractual frustration. They're not very open on their pricing, and I've experienced this myself. This is definitely a problem when you take it. This is not a small expense, as you're well aware. You're paying millions of dollars.

The millions of dollars is easily recoverable because the ROI that is there, but ultimately when you're putting the contract together, and you have all the legal teams involved the team from Cotiviti is not making it easy by any means, and they're seeing contingency based fees. We feel they're being very opportunistic, with all of the custom work that they want to do and all the stuff. I think that is something that also is an impact or a drawback.

### Client
It sounds like you're going to provide a summary.

### Expert
My summary is, if I was sitting in front of the CEO or I don't know whoever else would care to listen, I would say support gap is definitely true. I've got this again and again. I've experienced myself the setup complexity. I can tell you firsthand. I've I experienced technical bugs, which is definitely there. Experienced myself pricing issues, which is definitely there. The last thing that I've seen is, basically, some of the provider friction that is there. It's a small part, but in times I've seen that where they add abrasion overall from some of the escalation from some of these providers and so on.

### Client
Okay. There are a few things that I'm hearing from others, and wondered what you think, but what about the importance of a robust first pass editor, how much does that matter as an operational first pass editor versus a second pass solution that identifies savings missed by initial claim processing systems? There have been comments comparing Cotiviti here versus competitors and just wondering if you've heard of anything like this.

### Expert
Yeah. My view is in the world of healthcare payment systems, especially what Cotiviti specializes in. Claims editing is all about matching, if you take a look, what is the core of it? It's all about catching errors, fraud, overpayment before or even after the money gets to the providers. I think you're right, the thing that you're saying. A first pass editor is a quick checkpoint. You know what I mean, "Hey, let's fix it the first time." Basically, it's a frontline, automated, and fast to catch obvious problems right away.

The second pass is basically naturally what I'm talking about is really a deeper drive that happens right after. This is where something may slip, and then you're trying to catch it. Remember these second passes are usually in the prepaid phase just before the first pass, is a pre-phase, and then the second pass could be a post phase and so on and so on. I would say that yes, good productivity I think layering them when you're into an integrity, the first path for quick wins they do really, really well, which is really what most people want.

I think the second path, basically what we are talking about is a myth. I would say my analysis of this the first, like they're really good at that. The basic validation codes, eligibility, duplicates, and so on and so on. They're able to do this because in the first pass, like for example, in 70%-80% of the errors, which are cost and which is really what you want, which is super fast, no payment delays, low cost upfront, great for compliance and all those good things that you do want. That's my take. Again, it's preventing like massive waste in the past and you're getting all your payments up front and so on and so on.

### Client
Great. You wondered about competitive positioning. You said a few things already. To what extent are they operating in a narrower market segment compared to competitors, such as Optum and how much does that matter? Any thoughts?

### Expert
Yeah. Again, as I said, I hate to say that I'm being biased, but maybe I think Cotiviti maintains a commanding position. Especially in the payment integrity solution market. Basically, if you take a look that market alone is supposed to be the key there. Naturally, I don't know all the exact details as far as like what is their marketing leadership and in that. I would say that they hold a robust positioning, especially against Optum.

However, if you take a look at Optum, I think they are really strong in, and that they do a really good job on the payer provider synergy, broader analytics and so on and so on. I think the analytics that Cotiviti has is good, but from what I know from Optum that I have used it maybe for like a year, maybe at the most. I've seen it there, but they've done a really good job at that.

I think that they hold a much higher position. If you take a look at like Cotiviti, I think Cotiviti holds and outpaces Optum, Zelis, and others. In the client stickiness it's AI center of excellence like payment integrity. Of course, all of the integration that they play a real value. I think that's the number one thing that it does really, really well.

I think in all the customers that we have implemented it or work with, they're always in praise with all of the performance and the accuracy that it has. That's a definite thing. I think innovation, they were poor before. I think they did the Edifecs acquisition in March. Whenever they did that, I think after post-Edifecs, I think it leads now in AI for detection of cross pay analytics and cost reduction. I think they're doing a really, really good job. If I'm not mistaken that they are following their data platform or something. The healthcare data platform or something of that nature. Some AI healthcare data platform or something like that.

Any which way. I think that if you take a look at their all of their things that they're doing there, they stand up. Now where does Zelis stand out? It's a little bit further away, but I think the differentiator that Zelis has, which that Cotiviti needs to catch up is on the real-time claims, routing, cost-effectiveness for all the mid-tier.

If I take a look at, for example, when we did this Blue Cross Blue Shield of Idaho, I think those guys love them because they feel that they are a very cost-effective solution for them. I don't think Cotiviti can play a big role there because that is their weaker play. They don't have the good solution, I believe for mid-tier as an example. Going back to what you're asking for, I think Cotiviti positioning is very strong. I think it plays a really strong focus in all of the prepay integrity, which is good. I think there are weaknesses in the mid-size plays, especially when they're competing at the lower end of the market.

Ultimately, a company like Optum, I think that they have a little bit of an edge on when they talk about some aspects like the integration with the payer provider synergy that they have and analytics that they have, which Cotiviti that if I were to put my R&D dollars, this is where I would want to actually put some meat in the business.

### Client
Okay. Almost out of time. Any final last words? Anything to add or highlight or summarize?

### Expert
Yeah. One of the things that they have not done, what I've heard some of the other competitors do is like really get into this whole agentic business. What is the agentic business? These are like automated robots that are doing a whole bunch of work and so on and so on. Most of these vendors have started on innovation. Naturally, it's all about innovation and all about catching up if I were to double down on that. I don't think you had asked that question, but I think it's really Cotiviti needs to have its innovation strategy built around more focused on its strength, which is payment integrity.

They need to actually make sure that they are there. I would say, to grow they need to start putting a lot of focus on mid-tier solutions, because as you are well aware, there's a lot of these smaller vendors that are coming out, smaller payers and providers that are coming out. They need to have solutions. I think a better solution for them as well. I think they need to avoid all the AI pitfalls. Example, what they need to do is stop over promising by grounding innovations in the clinical reality, for example. They need to do that. I think that's something that they have not done in a good fashion, I would say.

I think in the first half of 2026, they need to basically start doing more deeper ML in investments, having some kind of cage and agentic AI do a lot of the work. Remember in any payer system there's a lot of front end people doing, picking up calls, looking up claims, processing claims. Can this all be done by agentic AI as an example where everybody seems to be putting a lot of focus around that? I think that is something that they have not done in a good fashion. I know that they've been talking about it, but I think the world is now turning around that right for what they're doing.

I think in Edifecs, it's still new. It's still not even a year old. They'll get in a few months, it'll be a year old. They bought it, they've done some integration to it, but I don't think it is into a level that has created a big stir in the market and like, "Oh my God, this Edifecs is such a great business for Cotiviti." I don't think that

has happened. I think they need to do a lot more with that for doing that right.

I think they have started by building some center of excellence around AI, and they've created a Cotiviti roadmap for rollouts in 2026 for their payment integrity. I think those are some of the things that I would just try to build something. I think what they need to do to be competitive is really have more of an AI-enabled ecosystem that blends all of this payment integrity and value-based care systems to a much thing.

I think another thing that they have not done really well in my view that they should do is build stronger ecosystems for partnerships, because naturally, as you are well aware, a lot of these big system integrators, whether it be the Indian system integrators like Wipro and so on.

They are some of the bigger people who are incumbent in a lot of these bigger healthcare providers and so on. Really, bringing them to the mix, really giving them a good education on their platform, and good education on what they have done will serve them good in the long run because then these people become the front end to really becoming the core system that is selling, implementing, and stabilizing the system.

This is almost like the SAP, where SAP basically decided to embed itself in a lot of the all the big system integrators, and that became a win win for them because all the large system integrators became the front end for everything that they were doing with them. I think that's something that Edifecs has not done really well. I think that's something that I would spend some time on as well. I think those are my things.

I know you did not ask too much about like the core innovations that they're working on. I know you did not really put a lot of focus around like the ecosystem around them, which is like people who implement then specialized resellers and so and so on. I think those are some other things that I would double down on, and really put a focus around innovation, which is key.

### Client
Any quick words on that? What are the takeaways in terms of core innovations and the ecosystem around them? Anything that's a game changer or superpower or Achilles heel?

### Expert
Yeah. The superpower on that like I think is one word is the agentic integration of AI, which is really the AI deep clinical expertise that agentic systems can bring. People talk about agentic AI and say, "What is all that about?" Naturally, in the system like Cotiviti, which even if you take a look at like when I hear them talk, I think that they don't talk about that at all because they take that for granted.

They put a lot of focus around their payment accuracy, and risk adjustments, and so on and so on, but they really don't put a lot of emphasis on the technology themselves. They're putting a lot of emphasis on the core of what they are doing within their systems, but not within the things that they should be doing. I think this is a big red flag.

Yes, people like what they do, but they also like with every other company, whether your airline, whether your hotel, or in this case as a healthcare provider, AI and technology should be the front runner in a lot of this. All of the other stuff that they've done for many, many years are just the background which they have done. They know what they're doing. What they're not well known is the core of the technology. I think that's where I would say using of natural language processing, machine learning for anomaly detection. These are some of the things. Integrating agentic AI to reduce false positives, implementation with human and technology oversight.

These are all things that I think that are not buzzwords anymore. They are reality, which I don't see Cotiviti doing. Even when I look at if I were to go look at their website, it seems like it's outdated. It's just doesn't look that modern site that I want to look at, which they need to do. As simple as that just as an example, the first interference that somebody might have in a website looks very, very old.

### Client
Great. A nice balanced perspective on strengths and weaknesses, areas for improvement, and your thoughts on their future and competitors. This is great. Thank you very much for all these insights and perspectives
