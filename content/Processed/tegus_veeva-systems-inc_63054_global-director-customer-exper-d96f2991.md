## Interview Transcript

### Tegus Client
Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today about Veeva. To start off, could you please give us a quick overview of your background and experience in this space?

### Global Director - Customer Experience & Omnichannel at Boston Scientific Corporation
I joined Boston a year and a half ago. And my role is kind of a hybrid of a couple of different functions. I report into marketing. My title is the Global Director of Customer Experience and Omnichannel Efforts. My job is to find programs that modernize how we show up to our doctor customers. We've got several different divisions within our businesses. We call on many different customer doctor specialties.
Health care, in general, MedTech, a bit of a legacy industry where sales reps, marketing efforts, digital, medical education; these channels are very siloed in how they show up to a doctor. My team and I were trying to work across programs to think about the end user, the doctor and how do you build a coordinated, connected experience that is meeting the needs of that individual customer.
Although I report into marketing, I work very closely with IT, our analytics group and with sales. And through those four functions, inclusive of marketing, I work with the businesses to build out these programs that are automating a lot of the connections between sales and marketing and then figuring out how to get doctors more quickly through the buying process.

### Tegus Client
What type of technologies are you working with to accomplish that.

### Global Director - Customer Experience & Omnichannel at Boston Scientific Corporation
Lots of different platforms. For this conversation, I'll focus on Salesforce. We use our Sales Cloud as a CRM tool. We use Marketing Cloud for marketing automation work that we do, we leverage other clouds within the Salesforce universe to build off medical education programs, invitations to future events. Outside of Salesforce, we have a lot of other things like website, paid media and other platforms that can actively engage with customers on a daily basis.

### Tegus Client
And are you currently a customer of Veeva as well?

### Global Director - Customer Experience & Omnichannel at Boston Scientific Corporation
I'm not. I was a customer of Veeva for six years before joining Boston Scientific. But obviously, a big competitor of Veeva would be Salesforce. I'm currently a Salesforce customer at the present moment.

### Tegus Client
And were you there to make that decision?

### Global Director - Customer Experience & Omnichannel at Boston Scientific Corporation
I was not there to make the decision, but I'm happy to give you pros and cons of both. I'll start with Salesforce and then I'll go to Veeva. What I like about Salesforce, the offering is nothing specific to their Sales Cloud or CRM platform, but I like all the integrations from a pro standpoint. There's a lot more integrations that Salesforce has with Marketing Cloud, Sales Cloud, Community Cloud, Service Cloud. They've got portfolio of products that fits very nicely into the world that I'm trying to navigate and advance and modernize.
From an interconnection between Sales Cloud and Marketing Cloud, interconnection between Service Cloud and Sales Cloud, Salesforce has done a very nice job building a universe that is plug and play to be able to quickly build programs between the different clouds on Salesforce. The big con for Salesforce is the user experience. When I say user experience, it's how a sales rep or a marketer would engage the platform. There's a lot of clicks to get into areas. It's not very easy to find what you are trying to do.
I've seen just in my 18 months at Boston, I've heard from sales reps, sales leaders, the interface, the experience that sales reps and marketers have, it's a bit clunky. I think that's limiting our ability to drive adoption of using these tools as well as the impacts that these programs could have. That's Salesforce.
Veeva from a pro standpoint, I really like their navigation. It is very clear and the user interface, whether you're looking at your territory view, looking at a specific account view, navigating in and out of different views, looking at what's in your queue, what's a top priority, what's the medium priority, where to go next to get more information on a lead, on an opportunity. It is much easier to leverage as an end user being a marketer or a sales rep. Everything from looks, vision, iconography is much better. I think navigation of what are the flows that you would want to do if you are an end user is much more thought out. Veeva is a lot more customized to the needs of clients.
It is not everything I gave the suggestions to my Veeva account team, they could action, but they were much more likely to take something at it into their backlog of product features, enhancements and have the opportunity to see that actually move into production and enhancements that Veeva was giving to my old company, where I feel like Salesforce, they are really big and not as customer-friendly on driving enhancements based on client needs.
I think the con to Veeva is although they have multiple product lines, they have a content-approval system, I think, that's called Veeva Records. They have their bread and butter, which is a CRM tool. They've got approved e-mails that reps can send. It doesn't have the full suite of functionality that a Salesforce has. Those would be my major pros and cons for Veeva versus Salesforce.

### Tegus Client
It sounds like it comes back to the fact that Salesforce wasn't really tailor-made for the life sciences industry in the same way that Veeva was?

### Global Director - Customer Experience & Omnichannel at Boston Scientific Corporation
Yes, Veeva is tailored basically for pharma and then subsequent parts of Life Sciences, whereas Salesforce is a catchall for many different industries.

### Tegus Client
Do you think that there is potential that Salesforce creates maybe a more pharma-focused solution given the noncompetent in this area does expire with Veeva's decision to move off of Salesforce?

### Global Director - Customer Experience & Omnichannel at Boston Scientific Corporation
I think it's an interesting question. I think that pharma, life sciences, MedTech, biotech, I mean, there's a lot of opportunity to create a product that is better tailored and service the needs of health care, life sciences, that would be a big upgrade from where Salesforce is today. I don't have any knowledge that they are looking to go down that route. But if I were a strategist and a portfolio person in Salesforce, I would have to imagine they're looking at budgets.
They're looking at industry verticals and where is the biggest need to drive a more competitive, a more compelling offering within Sales Cloud and the broader areas that I hope they're at least exploring building something more specific to life sciences. But if you look at the growth, you look at any type of long-term growth trajectories, health care has got to be a top tier set of industries under life sciences for long-term growth. Veeva is specific towards life sciences and pharma, in more particular, they do have a leg up over a Salesforce as far as how business-friendly and how business-compatible the offerings are.

### Tegus Client
To the extent that Salesforce did hypothetically introduce something here for pharma or maybe life sciences in general. What do you think is the likelihood that your former employer or just other pharma companies would consider switching off of Veeva?

### Global Director - Customer Experience & Omnichannel at Boston Scientific Corporation
Yes. I think that Veeva has had a lot of success. At least a couple of years ago, they had engagements with 19 of the top 20 pharma companies globally. They're pretty entrenched. Sticking costs are relatively low. CIOs, CMOs and CFOs are trying to figure out where to squeeze out cost to improve top line and bottom line. I think this would be an area that would at least be up for evaluation.
Veeva likes to have longer-term contracts to the three- to five-year route with their clients. It would be a wait-and-see approach. But I do think that if Salesforce was able to build something that was more specific towards the needs of life sciences. There would be strong interest in the pharma, MedTech, biotech, life science verticals. There will be interest to better understand an alternative option given that Veeva really dominates the industry today.

### Global Director - Customer Experience & Omnichannel at Boston Scientific Corporation
A lot of your work is both on the IT side, but also working with marketing and sales. I'd love to get your perspective on like sales headcount across the industry. There have been a couple of high-profile reductions in force, but in the longer term, it sounds like there might still be some ongoing pressure on headcount across the industry? From the sales side.

### Global Director - Customer Experience & Omnichannel at Boston Scientific Corporation
Yes. I think the latest data out of ZS says that a face-to-face interaction with a doctor is still 20% less from a volume standpoint than where they were before COVID. So figuring out how to maximize the impact and the resourcing of your selling organization for the future, I think for a lot of sales leaders is the first question that I need to wrestle with. In short term, you can look at from an efficiency standpoint, potentially delaying the sales reps that have left the organization, retired and you may want to delay to see how that territory, that area performs while that person is dormant.
I do think that over time, and I don't think technology is going to come in and replace sales reps. That is not the role that from everything that I have seen. That's not the role the technology is playing. There is an understanding that customers' expectations and customers' behaviors and when I say customers, I mean doctors, doctors have already changed their behaviors. They've already changed how they want to engage with health care, with pharma, with MedTech, their expectations and their behaviors have shifted already.
Before they relied so heavily on their rep, they would go personally. They would professionally build a strong relationship with their sales rep over time. The reality is in an environment where there's shorter attention spans, there wants to be real-time responses and information and solutions that a doctor can quickly find, I think digital is playing a larger role.
That's where a coordination between sales and marketing play is just a much more dramatic importance now and going forward than it did before COVID. I do think that over time there will be a "rightsizing," on selling organizations. I do not see technology ever replacing or even coming close to 50% to 75% reduction of the selling organization. From a commercial perspective, sales, marketing, how do you drive a more efficient, more modern, and relevant model to doctors,
I would see a small decrease over time in field and selling organization FTEs or bodies. I would expect to see, and you're already seeing that shifts into how to leverage a technology platform that can bring more of that coordinated effort, that visibility on what customers care about. And then how do you activate in a more real-time, more relevant way to doctors, whether it's a rep going to do something, whether it's an invitation to an upcoming local event, whether it's a medical education invitation or a marketing e-mail.
Longer term, you will start to see a small minimal decreases in sales organizations because the sales rep will be more empowered with their own understanding of their customer plus then the digital tools that will enable them to be more efficient with their time and potentially even engage more customers with the same amount of resources.

### Tegus Client
It sounds like, outside of public reductions and force, this will just happen through attrition like naturally?

### Global Director - Customer Experience & Omnichannel at Boston Scientific Corporation
Yes.

### Tegus Client
What is the turnover in a rep base? How much of that do you think will get backfilled each year? It sounds like that trend may be in the medium term is like downwards, but not cataclysmic.

### Global Director - Customer Experience & Omnichannel at Boston Scientific Corporation
I don't think it will be cataclysmic in any period that you and I would be talking about. I do think that there's a lot of pressure on sales leaders to squeeze out any excess fat. Shorter term, for a quarter or even two, you can play the game of not backfilling and not backfilling through attrition or people that have moved to a different therapeutic area or a division.
I think in the longer term, though, the opportunity from a sales, sales operation standpoint is to say, I have this amount of customers, I have this amount of field reps or sales reps, and I have these business objectives. Based on that, how many reps do I need to be able to hit my objectives and best serve my current customer base. And I think that I do see, and I don't think I see technology being a way to drive more efficiencies in the processes on how you can engage a customer or a doctor.
In the short term, medium term or long term, a cataclysmic fall or decrease in field organizations. They still play a major role in how you engage a customer. And in specific industries like life sciences and health care, I think in the short term, medium term, and long term, they will continue to be the number one channel that customers and doctors will go to, to better understand the device or product, to better understand who's the right patient population to use, what is the device, the pill, the injection indicated for, and helping support with their patients to drive better outcomes.

### Tegus Client
Like it would have a fairly significant impact on productivity, also not going face-to-face, being able to do things virtually, arguably could have similar benefits allowing reps to see more doctors in one day, for example?

### Global Director - Customer Experience & Omnichannel at Boston Scientific Corporation
Yes.

### Tegus Client
Any sense of what the productivity gains are from like a quota per rep perspective? Or like any way you would try and frame that out?

### Global Director - Customer Experience & Omnichannel at Boston Scientific Corporation
Yes. In my previous company, we were actually able to increase. This is in the height of the pandemic. We were actually able to increase calls per day. That was a big metric that my previous company looked at from a metrics and performance standpoint, and we actually were able to show statistical lift based on leveraging digital tools to make reps more productive. In general, you can look at a lot of different omnichannel customer centricity white papers by McKinsey, BCG or ZS, and they will show you anywhere in the neighborhood of 20% to 40% increase on rep productivity.
That is not to say that's an increase to top line or bottom line, but that is to say, 20% to 40% increase in how productive reps are. It's determined in a lot of different ways, like quality of engagement with a customer, number of touch points or interactions over a day, a week, a month, or a quarter. They would look at things like NPS scores and being able to correlate the use of digital tools to get better customer satisfaction scores. A lot of different ways that they were getting to that 20% to 40%. I've seen a lot of different research companies and consulting firms, and they're pretty consistent in the 20% to 40% range of rep productivity with the use of digital tools in a more structured manner.

### Tegus Client
Does that mean that like the rep base could be 20% smaller over several years, just given these productivity gains?

### Global Director - Customer Experience & Omnichannel at Boston Scientific Corporation
Yes.

### Tegus Client
If you want to grow, your reps are 40% more productive, you're not going to reduce the field base by 40%, right?

### Global Director - Customer Experience & Omnichannel at Boston Scientific Corporation
Yes. A lot of health care is based on product launches or indication launches. If you're sitting with the selling organization, for simple terms, 100 reps. You have a big pipeline of a lot of products that are disruptive over three to five years like you're not going to scale down your selling organization because they're more productive.
You're going to want to make sure you're maximizing your investment in your portfolio, whether it's devices, whether it's pharmaceuticals, whether it's biotech. One thing that we're not going to talk about a lot is the portfolio and the pipeline. But that's a big reason why the selling organizations are larger than one may see them on paper at a static point in time and say, well, if you make your reps more efficient and more productive, then you can just eliminate that number of reps.
But the reality is with products that are constantly coming into the market and doctors, especially having a lot of questions, the rep is the number one channel that a doctor is going to go to, they talk and talk about the indication, who is the appropriate patient. As those are changing and you're getting new products, new devices and new pills and injections coming in the marketplace, that's the main reason why selling organizations have withstood the test of time.
It is because they are the ones in first line of defense for new products that are hitting the marketplace. Even if you get 20%, 30% rep productivity gains, I don't see that 20%, 30% or 40% decrease in staff, especially if you're in a company with a pretty robust pipeline.

### Tegus Client
And of course, the inverse of that is drugs coming off of patent and regulation. Specifically, a lot of people have spoken about the IRA being a slight near-term negative for the life sciences industry as a whole. Can you just give me your perspective on those two topics?

### Global Director - Customer Experience & Omnichannel at Boston Scientific Corporation
I'll start with the second one because that's a big focus for everyone in health care. Europe is implementing privacy and regulation standpoint. That then translate into more forward-thinking and less business-friendly more patient-friendly states like California, Colorado, and New York. And then how does that translate into the U.S. from a national standpoint. My ability to drive automation and the better connects data and data sets and visibility on what customers or accounts or hospitals are doing and then be able to better activate in real time.
That's a big question mark right now. We're able to navigate it today. Most health care companies have really strong compliance, legal, regulatory and teams that can help me on the commercial side, navigate the changing laws state by state and at the federal level. But that is a question that a lot of people in my parts of health care are talking about at every conference that I attend, it's what are the regulations from a technology standpoint? What are the regulations from a privacy standpoint? And just broader, what are patients and consumers expecting or not expecting you'd be able to do with their own data.
Some people love the fact that if they click on an ad for Zappos shoes then it shows up everywhere else, and a lot of people are really freaked out about that. I use that kind of tongue-in-cheek, but that's a one that anyone can understand. I think over the next five years, there will be some dramatic changes from a regulatory standpoint in what we can and can't do. But I do think that that is our opportunity to really navigate and drive change.
And wherever the cards may land from a regulation standpoint, from a privacy standpoint, it's up to the business side, the commercial side to understand the changes, understand the impact and to continue to leverage digital tools, both on the data and infrastructure standpoint as well as on the activation side. We can continue to drive maximum impact with our resourcing against our main customers.

### Tegus Client
Are you an IQVIA customer? Who is the biggest data provider in your organization?

### Global Director - Customer Experience & Omnichannel at Boston Scientific Corporation
A few use Komodo Data. We use IQVIA. We use Definitive Healthcare and a few other smaller data sources.

### Tegus Client
If there's like greater regulation and scrutiny on the data side, does that hamper in any way some of the productivity gains that you get from your sales force?

### Global Director - Customer Experience & Omnichannel at Boston Scientific Corporation
100%. It could hamper to a little extent or to a large extent, what we're able to do from a commercial activation standpoint. The reality is from a selling organization, the changing today and what I've seen in the last couple of years, some of the privacy work, especially coming out of Europe and then coming out of California that will eventually, in some way, shape or form, hit the U.S. from a national standpoint, it's not really impacting the traditional sales rep as much.
It's really hitting people that are trying to drive transformation, digital change and what you could do three or four years ago to what you can do now is limited based on new legislation state by state. I do think that over time, the opportunity to understand the regulations, wherever they may land, that's where things like first-party data strategy, third-party data strategy, how do we as a business, as a company, better manage our data, how do we better capture customer consent earlier on in engagements?
I always talk about a customer journey or the funnel, but how do we get contacts to engage earlier on and consent to future engagements with my company. And so we're constantly shifting priorities around based on where things are, what's looking like coming out of Washington, what's looking like that's coming in the state capitals so that we're placing bets that we think are going to pan out.
But we're doing it in a way that we're able to continue on this digital modernization on how we engage customers in a timelier relevant way but do it in a way that we're setting ourselves up and trying to future-proof what we can do based on the changing privacy and regulations that are going on.

### Tegus Client
Then just on the patent topic?

### Global Director - Customer Experience & Omnichannel at Boston Scientific Corporation
From senior executive level, you're always trying to balance your pipeline and what you can expect out of your pipeline from FDA trials and then approval of new drugs versus the patent cliffs on your blockbuster drugs that are currently in market.
The good companies, I'd say the top 10 companies, pharma companies can really balance what they see that and when they know their patents, they are going to expire versus what's in their pipeline, and they're constantly pulling up, pushing back, adding more clinical trials in to really right-size and make sure that over time, you may have a year where it's a big uptick or downtick in sales and then resource to require.
But over time, you're positively growing to whatever expectation that you and the Wall Street analysts have so that you can continue to drive your growth and drive your investment and resourcing.
Patents are always something that are a concern of sales leaders and quite frankly, marketing leaders. The good companies are able to right-size patent expiry with new products and finding ways to continue from a pharma standpoint, to continue to drive real-world evidence, to continue to drive indications. It's not even a product launch, but you have a product that has two indications, you can get another two indications with a little bit lighter lift and trying to launch a full new drug coming out there.
Patent expiries are always something that we're constantly managing from a commercial perspective. But I don't really see a big swing at a company level. So you may have a company that plays in three therapeutic areas and over a certain timeframe if Therapeutic Area one had a majority of sales reps, but the pipeline in two and three are much larger. The company's selling organization is not getting bigger or smaller, but the shift on one therapeutic area versus the other two will change.
But I don't think of patent expiry as being a true shift on the number of sales reps for a large pharmaceutical or even a large MedTech company. They may just shift the people moving around from their bag today to their bag tomorrow, but I don't see patent expiry or even just generic competition coming in. I don't see that as a major driver from an organization on the size of the selling organization.

### Tegus Client
I've heard this topic of like biosimilars come up a lot recently. What does that mean for companies relative to generic competition?

### Global Director - Customer Experience & Omnichannel at Boston Scientific Corporation
U.S. is still very business-friendly from a pipeline and what FDA is allowing companies to charge for product innovation. It takes $2 billion on average to launch a pharmaceutical drug. And with that understanding, our health care system, the FDA, the other supporting regulatory bodies allows for prices for pharma products or medical device products that can offset the investments for risky trials of medical devices and pharma.
From a volume standpoint, I think they will come in and continue to come in and take share in legacy or more commoditized therapeutic areas or business areas. The U.S. is one of the best places to invest in innovation, product innovation, portfolio expansion. In the U.S. in particular, I don't see biosimilars coming in and completely disrupting the current model of reach and frequency from a selling organization and marketing organization as well as the investment strategy on pipeline management and building out a pipeline that can meet the future and changing needs of consumers, patients around the U.S.
I do think that that question on biosimilars and generic competition is a lot more competitive and is a bigger concern outside the U.S. I think in Europe, biosimilars and generic competition is a much bigger threat to big multinational pharmaceutical and MedTech companies. This in Europe and parts of Asia in comparison to the U.S., where I think from a volume standpoint, they'll get a lot of their devices and/or products into the hands of consumers and patients. But from a revenue or a value perspective, I don't see, in the short term, them as a major threat to the business model of big MedTech and big pharma.

### Tegus Client
What about the Inflation Reduction Act and the potential impact to drug pricing and innovation from some of the pricing restrictions built in?

### Global Director - Customer Experience & Omnichannel at Boston Scientific Corporation
I'm not an expert on the Inflation Reduction Act. In some categories, especially that are a bit more commoditized and serving an older population, I think the IRA and the list price focus on top 30 drugs, top 50 drugs, top 100 drugs that meet that retiree population, there are challenges in the short term, and the long term. As you think about just where the growth in investments are in these areas like gene therapy and more down to the individual, there's a lot of innovation that is going across the aged demographic.
I think 50 years ago, a lot of medicine was going to a retiree population. Over time, there's been a shift to be more preventative and to try and catch things earlier on, so you don't have to go to an OR to be admitted. Especially with gene therapy and areas in the oncology space, like CAR T, where you're using people's plasma and other areas over a process and putting it back into their body that's new and improved, like that innovation is not something that the IRA or the list price of the top 30 drugs or top 50 drugs.
I'm not the IRA expert, but I don't think that there's a focus there. Businesses and health care companies are shifting some of their pipeline, investments and their prioritization into other areas to capture and unlock growth and value and to drive better patient, clinical trials than once they were in market patient outcomes. For businesses that do focus on that elderly population, there's for sure downside risk today and tomorrow and in the future for those medications and for those devices.

### Tegus Client
And that just primarily because this is focused on Medicare?

### Global Director - Customer Experience & Omnichannel at Boston Scientific Corporation
Yes. I don't know where Democrats and Republicans are going to agree on much more than where we are today. But I think given that the original text for IRA was really focused on that Medicare. It's the top 30 drugs, if I'm not mistaken, that has a cap of $30 or $35, on a monthly basis.
But I don't see a lot of agreements going on in Washington from a House or Senate perspective in the next two years. They've gone as far as they can for now. But five or 10 years down the road, there's definitely opportunities to expand and get drug prices in some way, shape or form reduced.

### Tegus Client
Anything else that we haven't spoken about that you think we should touch on?

### Global Director - Customer Experience & Omnichannel at Boston Scientific Corporation
We've gone around the circle a bit on this one, which is good. It's been a good conversation for me. I do think that going back to Veeva versus Salesforce. I think today in the life sciences, health care, it is literally apples and oranges. I think Veeva has a strong hold both from an experience standpoint as well as just a model and a set of products that better meets the needs of marketers and sales leaders within the health care space.
But I think your question on like once there's an ability to for Salesforce to come in with a more tailored set of product that better meets the needs of health care companies like biotech, like pharma, like MedTech, there are lots of opportunities for Salesforce to come in and to start chipping away at the control that Veeva has today.
Salesforce has an opportunity just with other industries that are truly much more global in nature. From a growth standpoint, Veeva is still pretty U.S.-centric. Salesforce with their global footprint has an opportunity to continue to push the needle from a growth standpoint there.
On the flip side, Veeva has an opportunity to leverage their U.S. dominance in the health care area and take that to other like-minded or complementary or similar markets around the globe. So as you are building out your investment case for Veeva, an opportunity that is maybe a bit unwritten or undiscussed would be their ability not just to continue to drive their product offerings and to try to mirror what Salesforce has been able to do across industries, but I think their ability to drive geographic expansion outside the U.S. and outside of North America is a pretty big opportunity.
Understanding, obviously, there's nuances in laws and regulations and privacy constraints all over the place. But Salesforce has been able to expand globally across many industry verticals. I think Veeva has an opportunity as well to get growth outside of just U.S. and North America.

### Tegus Client
At your prior employer, how much like tweaking and customization did you do on your Veeva CRM?

### Global Director - Customer Experience & Omnichannel at Boston Scientific Corporation
We had a global tech stack. The nuance or the customization. So like the stack didn't really change market by market at my previous company. What did change is the experience, the navigation, the terminology and then the workflow management that you were able to do within Veeva from a CRM perspective.
Some markets really were trying to get towards more of account-based selling. Some markets were much more at the customer level, driven by a lot of different reasons, which is probably a whole another hour-call. The actual investment didn't really change, but how an individual market team, sales, and marketers, IT would bring that to life to their end users, be it sales reps or marketers, was a bit nuanced.
I think it's a classical 80/20, 80% of the investment was truly global. But then once it actually hit an end user, the navigation, the workflow management and then some markets just had a basic Veeva license, where others were a bit more digital-forward. So things like Veeva Rep-Approved Emails or Veeva Approved Emails, like the U.S. and a bit of the European markets really jumped on that in the height of the pandemic. As to your point, you're going to have a rep that's in front of a doctor once a month. But if you can find digital touch points to get in front of that customer on the off periods.
So you're meeting and then two weeks after you're sending an e-mail; a month after that, you're sending an invitation to a local event. You're continuing to stay top of mind with that doctor without having to physically drive your car and your bag of products to go wait in a waiting room to talk to a doctor for five minutes. Reps can be much more efficient in their time, if they're not just focusing exclusively on in-person conversations, but you are able to leverage a lot more digital channels that reps can manage.
And again, whether that's medical education or whether that's Veeva Approved Emails or just being able to better track through Veeva, what an individual account or what an individual customer is doing.
I think the trackability is much better and much greater today in Veeva on what your customers are engaging with, what they're not engaging with, if they're forwarding them on to their peers, Veeva's analytical arm is much greater today than what Salesforce and Sales Cloud has. It's easier and it's stronger to see what your customers are engaging with at all levels.

Veeva has publicly announced that they're moving off of the Salesforce Lightning platform or Force.com on to Vault for their CRM. If you're at Johnson & Johnson and you've customized the software a lot, are you concerned about this backend software transition?

### Global Director - Customer Experience & Omnichannel at Boston Scientific Corporation
From a marketer's perspective, which I will caveat, I'm not concerned with the backend, as long as I'm able to do a lot, if not all, of what I was able to do on Sales Cloud. Vault is great for a whole host of reasons. I'm not as familiar with the backbone and the infrastructure to be able to replicate what's being done today with Veeva CRM. But from a marketing perspective, as long as I'm able to do a lot of what I was able to do without any additional investments to Veeva from a marketing standpoint, that's not a major concern.
From an IT perspective, that's definitely a watch-out to understand what the integration path is to move from one to the other, and what are the hard operating expenses versus capital expenses that are needed to be done. From an IT perspective, there's a lot of questions. From a marketing perspective, as long as I'm able to do what I was able to do before without any additional costs and get some type of similar functionality, I don't have a lot of concerns from a marketing perspective.

### Tegus Client
So it's more an IT concern?

### Global Director - Customer Experience & Omnichannel at Boston Scientific Corporation
Yes, there are IT watchouts as you move from one platform to another.

### Tegus Client
In your marketing CRM focused spend, what's the growth look like for that this year?

### Global Director - Customer Experience & Omnichannel at Boston Scientific Corporation
So amongst a lot of priorities and investments from a commercial perspective, there's a lot of gray. There's the infrastructure and setting the foundation to be able to connect systems. And then there's the activation.
Now that you have a fuller view of a specific person or an account, how are you able to activate off of that customer based on how they're engaging with your messaging today. And so both from an infrastructure standpoint as well as an activation standpoint, we are spending money from a CRM perspective to better connect within our existing MarTech platform, we are increasing our spend from an activation standpoint.
So how do we look at high-value customer segments and how do we build connected programs that today don't exist, but that will be in market in six to 12 months. Between infrastructure and activation, a top priority from a growth standpoint and investments is on the activation side.
How do we better leverage CRM? How do we better connect into other systems so that we're making it easier for sales reps to see what their customers are engaging with? They need to know what's important to that customer at that given time and then be able to activate to do something better and more timely that can be more relevant to their customer and better meet the needs and objectives and goals of their customers.
A lot of companies overinvested in infrastructure and tech in the pandemic. A lot of people are spending a lot of money trying to figure out, "Okay, how do you better activate? How do you better leverage all of the tools today in the tech stack? How do you activate with speed? How do you activate with quality? How do you activate in more real time to personalize how you engage with customer A, customer B, customer C."
Five years ago, those three customers got the same set of engagements from reps, from marketing e-mails for medical education. Again, customers' expectations and behaviors have changed, so how do you personalize your engagements with customer A, customer B and customer C.
From an activation standpoint, it's a top priority for many pharmaceutical and health care companies on how you leverage technology, CRM, how do you better connect it to your commercial programs so that it's not these siloed channels that are touching your consumer or your customer, but it's how do you leverage the data on the backend to be more personalized and differentiate that next engagement to the customer that truly meets the need of your doctor.

### Tegus Client
It sounds like you already have the tech, and it's more so about figuring out how to use it better? If you look at the vending priorities.

### Global Director - Customer Experience & Omnichannel at Boston Scientific Corporation
I think that's where life sciences is. Most people invested over the last five years in tech, but then they were trying to push tech as opposed to being business minded. Now we're trying to say, "Okay, what's the biggest opportunity? What's the biggest pain point? What's the biggest priority? What today is the model? How do you build a better model of the future."
Then leverage all of the technology stack, all the products within the digital enablement, commercial enablement areas to better with speed in real time with relevancy, give a doctor, give a customer a more tailored personalized experience. Tech is there, not that everyone is perfect there. There's always room to get better. From an activation step, like what do you do now with the tech to provide a better customer experience, that's where a lot of health care companies are today.

### Tegus Client
