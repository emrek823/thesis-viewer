### A Little Context

Primary care physicians are the quarterbacks of care: coordinating care, preventing complications, and keeping populations healthy.

However, the healthcare payment system is shifting. Moving away from Fee-For-Service (paying for *volume* of visits) towards **Value-Based Care (VBC)** – rewarding providers for *quality* outcomes and *lower costs*. This shift is crucial for better healthcare, but it demands new workflows and capabilities from practices.

We free primary care physicians from the administrative burdens needed to run VBC so they can spend more time guiding care and keeping their patients healthy. Healthy patients cost less, and proactive care drives the fundamental thesis of value-based care.

### What's the problem?

Independent primary-care practices sit in value-based contracts through IPAs and ACOs - but even when they have the population health insights they don't have the time, staff, or tooling to take actions and deliver savings. That gap shows up in four ways:

1.  **Capacity Shortage**
    Hiring the 3-4 extra staff required to optimize savings would push them into the red, so practices either don't do it or don't do it well.
2.  **$100K+ Per Clinician Left on the Table**
    Incomplete risk adjustment, open quality gaps, and uncontrolled referral leakage forfeit well over $100K** in upside per provider each year.*
3.  **Point-Solution Overload**
    Every "AI widget" requires another workflow change; adoption collapses

4.  **Enterprise MSOs & VBC Enablers Don't Pencil Out**
    Traditional MSOs and VBC enablers cost $500K–$1M+ to launch, take 9–18 months to break even, and demand 25–50% of shared savings—ROI that only the largest groups can stomach.

\* McKinsey & Company, *Investing in the New Era of Value-Based Care* (Dec 16 2022).

\*\* This is an estimate of the average potential savings per clinician with the VBC model. It is estimated to be between 3% - 20% of US healthcare spending. We divide this number by the number of PCPs in the US to arrive at the average potential savings per clinician.

### What do we do?

To build AI-native primary care practices, we've built a workflow engine that can interface with EHRs, and other software providers to orchestrate tasks. An agentic AI workflow platform. See more about our plan here.

In addition, we are taking a different approach to achieve adoption. We operate as a **service company, and fractional COO** for primary care practices allowing them to scale their capacity and optimize their value based contracts. This includes:

*   **Forward deploying to accomplish core value-based tasks** (Annual Wellness Visits (AWVs), Transitional Care Management (TCM), Risk Adjustment Coding, Referral Management) via a blend of humans, software, & computer usage agents.
*   **Human in the loop specialists** virtually to handle exceptions, build workflows, and drive continuous optimization.
*   **Act as Operational Infrastructure for practices** - managing other point solutions as an extension of the practice and increase savings.
*   **Own the results, not just the product** - Performance-based outcomes. We get paid when practices capture additional savings or efficiency gains.

We started 2 months ago and are forward-deploying into a practice to prove ROI for an Independent Physician Association (IPA) with 40,000 covered lives and 188 physicians.

### Why do we win / How we're different

*   **We are not just picking winners to generate savings. We can change practices.**
    By combining AI agents and operational expertise, we drive down costs to SaaS-like levels—enabling risk-sharing models that reward success, not scale. AI bends the cost curve, letting us serve the "messy middle" of independent practices that traditional MSOs & Enablers (Privia, Aledade, Agilon) can't economically support.
*   **We own the work, not just the software**
    Traditional vendors hand you tools and wash their hands. We actually embed, execute, and are able to control & optimize risk by doing so.
*   **Eventually we can work in any EHR/UI—no APIs required**
    Our AI computer usage agents will navigate the same screens staff already use, eliminating integration nightmares.
*   **Standardized, ubiquitous workflows**
    By owning the execution as a service, we scale the same proven processes across every practice - no custom build for each.

### Long Term Vision: Making the Economics of VBC Competitive

For the first time, value-based care can compete head-to-head with fee-for-service economics. By leveraging AI and a blended workforce, we deliver services at SaaS-like margins – unlocking true scalability and making risk-sharing practical for independent practices.

Once we prove savings for practices and Independent Physician Associations (IPAs), we'll launch our own AI-native IPA, creating the highest-quality care at the lowest possible cost.

### Go-to-Market

#### Phase 1: Proof of Concept

*   Intentionally partner with a Metrowest IPA (40K lives, 188 physicians) to prove our model, refine workflows, and validate ROI.

*   Replicate this approach with additional IPAs once validated to build a scalable service playbook.
*   Leverage this case study in AAFP channels to craft targeted playbooks and high-impact collateral.

#### Phase 2 – Scale via Conferences, Partnerships & Relationships

*   Secure an AAFP partnership to unlock its 130 K-member PCP network.
    *   Re-run our "cookie-market-fit" playbook at AAFP's early-season conferences —the same channel that landed our current IPA pilot.
    *   We can rerun this with several other organizations including:
        *   The Independent Physicians Association of America (TIPAA)
        *   National Association of ACOs (NAACOs)
        *   Medical Group Management Association (MGMA)
        *   America's Physician Groups (APG)
*   **Partner with pop-health vendors, VBC consultants, & enablers as their ops function.** They set up the client relationship; we own the end-to-end tech execution that drives measurable savings.
*   **Turn advisors into intro machines.** Each advisor owns a monthly quota of warm hand-offs to target ACO + IPA execs; track hit-rate and prune deadweight.

### How do we make money?

#### Risk-Sharing PMPM (per member, per month) Model

*   **Operations Cost:** A small fee per member per month to cover operations (covers AI agents, virtual coordination, core workflows)
*   **Shared Risk:** A percentage of incremental savings captured above baseline
    *   Aligns incentives: we only earn when practices succeed

We charge $2.50 PMPM to cover operations, and only take 30% of upside we generate - meaning the IPA/ACO keeps the majority of savings and upside. On $10M in value, they net $6.7M.

By combining a modest PMPM with shared upside, we unlock economics competitive with fee-for-service models—finally making value-based care affordable and attractive for all practices.

### Market Size

*   **Primary Care Market:** ~279,000 active PCPs across 161,000+ practices in the US
*   **Target Segment:** Start with "Messy middle" - independent practices and IPAs too small for enterprise Managed Service Organizations
*   **VBC Growth:** Market expanding from $12B (2025) to $37B+ (2032) at 17% CAGR.
    Source
*   **Adoption Acceleration:** 61% of healthcare executives report shifting ≥25% to value-based arrangements
*   **CMS Push:** Aggressive targets to place all Medicare beneficiaries in accountable care by 2030

| Practice Type  | U.S. Total | Avg. VBC Patients | Est. Annual Revenue/ Practice* | TAM**     |
| :------------- | :--------- | :---------------- | :----------------------------- | :-------- |
| Small (1-3 PCPs) | 80,000+    | 3,000             | $126K                          | $10.8B    |

\*Base $2.50 PMPM + 30% of captured value ($100K/provider × 40% capture × 30% revenue share)
\*\*Our long-term growth strategy will expand to clinical workflow automation, patient engagement, and multi-payer optimization to sustain growth as initial VBC optimizations mature
