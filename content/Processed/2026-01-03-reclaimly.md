#### Higher recovery

Recovery Rate

Far above the 60–70% industry average.
Our automated follow-up ensures more balances get resolved.

#### No balance left behind

![Every patient gets a personalized outreach plan](/icons/howWorks1.svg)

### Every patient gets a personalized outreach plan

Our AI processes each bill, denial, and EOB to figure out what happened, what’s owed, and why — then builds a custom communication plan for that patient.

---

![Adaptive outreach across all channels](/icons/howWorks2.svg)

### Adaptive outreach across all channels

We coordinate emails, texts, calls, and statements in one timeline:

* Each step adjusts to coverage, replies, and status
* Messages are fully context-aware
* Tone escalates only when needed

---

![Human-level conversations](/icons/howWorks3.svg)

### Human-level conversations

Our AI talks to patients in clear, natural language — pausing, listening, and responding just like a real person. It explains coverage details, denied claims, and billing terms in simple words, handles objections calmly, and adjusts its tone to fit the situation.
