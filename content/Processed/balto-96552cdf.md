Current solutions are
not meeting needs

    *   HR support is insufficient; legacy solutions lack personalization & comprehensiveness
*   **Contact insurance provider**
    *   45% of consumers spend up to a month on billing corrections; carrier support limited to business hours
*   **Hire a healthcare advocate**
