**Client**
Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today about the revenue cycle management space. To start off, could you please give us a quick overview of your background and experience in this space?

**Expert**
At AleraCare, for the past two and a half years, I'm the vice president with oversight of operations and trade relations. It is a private equity-owned entity. We have over 30 infusion sites, home health as well. There's a special division, but with our conversations here, we are in 40 different centers in six different states.

How it pertains to this conversation, we are currently in more the rare disease space with a specialty rare disease focus. It is a position class of trade in which the main objectives, we currently have around 65

different formulas on formulary. As a part of the formulary design and implementation and contracts, not only from the reimbursement side but directly with the manufacturers.

When it comes to revenue cycle management, it is very important that we have, as an entity, a great understanding of the current products that we have, the reimbursements that we receive, how the marketplace is shifting, and the dynamics are coming into play on product selection as new therapies are coming on, as therapies are moving on to life cycle management in particular disease states.

We have a focus and interest in the neurology, cardiology, infectious disease, blood therapies. This conversation is just the overall landscape of where we are currently, what others in the area are doing and moving forward, and, in essence, how we maintain our strengths, our competitive advantage and ultimately increase revenue, increased margin.

Looking at it from a very thoughtful methodical process of, "Here's the therapies we're on, how are we getting reimbursed, what software and technologies are we implementing to ensure that the revenue cycle management is captured, obtained? First, what therapies are we in? What are others doing? How is the market shifting and adjusting? Are we billing out, and are we collecting those funds?"

**Client**
Do you happen to know a ballpark number of patients or number of claims that AleraCare is processing on whatever cadence, weekly, monthly, yearly?

**Expert**
Absolutely. We are in the chronic therapy. We look at it from week-over-week, month-over-month, quarter-over-quarter, where we're having double-digit growth. The number of patients that we claim in all of our 40 current sites, the ballpark, I would say, in a monthly average around 45,000 patients, the last numbers that I saw.

**Client**
On the pharmacy side of things, is it mostly focused on infusion, or are you also playing in the specialty pharmacy space as well?

**Expert**
Specialty, yes. We have two specialty pharmacies, one in Phoenix, Arizona, and one in Southern California. We have a true specialty pharmacy, and that is all 50 states, distributing not only from the rare disease but components of all of pharmacies dispensed out.

Our focus in Phoenix, Arizona, are those therapies that are rare disease, specialty, and subsequent to support their 40 sites and centers. When a product starts an induction phase for our infusion sites, it then moves to specialty pharmacy. We then utilize that to capture within that marketplace. We run two different business models.

**Client**
How would you break up from a revenue standpoint, the specialty side of things versus infusion?

**Expert**
Certainly. The infusion side is the majority of our revenue, and so on the infusion type, it's over 60% of our total revenue compared to the 40% with our specialty.

**Client**
How would you describe the current workflow for admin tasks on both the specialty and infusion side, in particular, the tasks that go into revenue cycle management, things like patient intake, benefit verification, prior auth, all of that?

**Expert**
Absolutely. Let's put it in two different components. The life cycle of a prescription as related to revenue cycle management. As we see it from the infusion side, all claims are processed centrally. When they're brought upon, the individual is onboarded.

The benefits investigation begins to ensure for scheduling access to care and all those components that go into it to include cost sharing with manufacturers and benefits investigation. At that point, when the order is received, the benefits begin, and the revenue cycle will begin. Meaning that first, we receive the order, then a benefits investigation begin.

The billing commences within the software system, which is a proprietary software we own. We add additional components to it where the revenue cycle then begins. We utilize the, at this time, technology and leverage so that we are able to process the order, the revenue cycle begins.

The reason why I differentiated into infusion versus a specialty majority of the claims that we have is on the medical billing since it is a physician class of trade. With revenue cycle, it typically is going to take us on these high-dollar costs, around $155 to process the claim and to move forward with the adjudication and the collection.

From a revenue cycle, when an order comes to us for infusion, it's going to take us around 14 days between having the order and actually scheduling the patient. The billing begins, at that point of adjudication and then the revenue cycle collection, it can be delayed. We're typically seeing around 45 days before we receive the money that we build out.

**Client**
You mentioned that you all have a proprietary software that's being used to work on RCM and then you have additional technologies that you're bolting on. Do you mind teasing that apart a little bit? What are the aspects that you all have built internally, and which are the technologies and companies that you've met with that you're currently working with in addition?

**Expert**
Yes. The majority of the companies we use will not be anything different than what you've heard in previous phone calls. What we're finding, because the amount of revenue that we have coming in and the resources, and we are an acquisition company, which is very similar to most infusion or specialty pharmacies that are either owned by a large healthcare or private equity.

We have the funding available for rapid succession and acquisition. As a part of one of the acquisitions that we had with this recent round of funding, we acquired an infusion center company. It was based in Georgia. As a part of that, it was positioning us with their software so that we can incorporate.

We found that the $100 million mark was the point where we could afford to move away from some of the other vendors we were using. In the revenue cycle component, what we brought into the software is, we run the benefits investigation, the letter of medical necessity on the infusion for physician class of trade.

The software, what we're finding, gives, for me, a better visibility and the timing the revenue cycle individuals, and those that are responsible report to our CFO, chief financial officer. Those components, we shifted that away from operations-based so that the revenue cycle could truly understand and put into play.

We had removed our CFO and replaced him with a new, and that was one of the implementations so that we could better have understand. We built dashboards based on the software. It gives better availability so that we can see where loss was coming from and not looking at it as, "Okay, well, we've lost this so much, we've lost this so much," but that's not quite good enough.

Through that revenue cycle management, through the software, we're able to break it into very manageable buckets, meaning contracts, meaning purchase acquisitions, not only from a rebate when we acquire on the front end, but discounts on the back end.

Through the software, it gives us better visibility on all the VPs, all the executives, and ultimately the board,

where we can see truly where the loss is and how to then fix that loss. We're not writing off as much. Those were some of the key components we purchased with, we had built into the software.

Fundamentally, it just gives our owners and the investors, a better macro view that can look into that macro, micro view that we would need, or those that are in operations would need, to make better, sound decisions.

**Client**
It sounds like you decided to invest in your own proprietary RCM solutions at the $100 million mark. That's just at the top-line revenue scale?

**Expert**
Yes.

**Client**
Based on that, how are you defining the most important metrics for success? Some folks talk about the problem they're trying to solve and how they want to tackle this, framing it in terms of leakage or speed from order to scheduling, and then the whole full billing cycle getting completed. Can you share how you think about the most important metrics at this scale, and how they've shifted since you've invested in the RCM capabilities?

**Expert**
Absolutely. One of the key hurdles, as I talk to that, is just implementation and success, where we're running into because we're having growth, we have capital for investments. We had to systematically look at it because there is a risk of failure. What I mean by that is, if we're implementing these multiple changes, regardless of where it is, but our conversation will be on the revenue cycle management.

What we found is that when we're moving forward and making implementations of new systems, new changing, that there is a natural dip. That dip, there are risks that we had to clearly define, what are acceptable levels of risk, what are unacceptable levels of risk.

Through meeting with the developers, meeting with the leaders from the purchasing side, the CFO, the contracts, the operations side, it's part of all those, they touch most everything, seeing what can be done and saying, "Could you? Should you?" Moving forward with all the information that's available. Why I point that out is, we have a lot of options to move forward with.

There was a reluctancy to pick one and just stick to that and move forward because so many different components. As I break it down, we got together quickly and said, "Where is our biggest loss coming from? Where is the largest and quickest way to correct that? How do we measure it, and then what do we need as far as sustainability?"

That was the thought processes that led us to why we do, what we do, and how we do it the way we do is what we found. Everyone coming in came from a different background, came from different perspectives, and there was a reluctancy to push forward, but that is not how we'll be successful in business.

Through that approach, it was determined that the buckets were first, let's go for the low-hanging fruit, which is loss. By looking at that level first, looking at the revenue cycle management key components, including billing key components, the contracting key components, collection, that was the first and that was the highest level of priority. That was due to the amount of loss that we have had in the past.

**Client**
Just to clarify, for example, loss from not following through and scheduling the patient in time and therefore missed opportunity to deliver the services to the patient, or other aspects of loss could be, we completed and did the infusion, but patient wasn't successful at collecting the bill. Is it all of those?

**Expert**
All of those. We bucketed them first into a larger loss and then broke it down into areas that we could control

the quickest, easiest, and areas we couldn't control. First, starting in the scheduling component, moving next into the collections, and then the bad debt as a subsequent, then moving into the purchasing and acquisition component as related to acquiring the product.

We moved away from a purchasing model, which is based on operations, "Here's what we buy, here's the contracts that we need to negotiate, the terms of reimbursement, those specifics again, rebates in the beginning, a tier base, discounts on the back end." There was just a huge amount of loss that we were experiencing.

Truthfully, until we looked into it, we didn't know that much loss was occurring. From there, it came to collections, and that was a significant amount of collections. From there, we gathered the information and, through root cause said, "Why are we having this loss?" Through our system, we were able to determine through the processing, but the billing was actually occurring.

The collections were not because of inefficiencies within operation. You can't really remove one from the other. That was an area because we were very specifically silo-ing, "Here's revenue cycle management, how much money is coming in," but instead, looking at it from an interdisciplinary component, why is it not occurring?

What we found billing through either the third-party payers, United, Cigna, Aetna, or through the medical or even Part D, the government agencies. What we found through really diving in, that operations was billing incorrectly through the different coding, through the different eligibility, through the different collection states.

And then leveraging in the manufacturers have many of these cost-sharing opportunities and educations, that based on the revenue coming in, we determine and was able to decrease that loss a significant amount.

**Client**
The scale in dollar amount of what you're estimating the loss, given you're $100 million scale from a revenue standpoint, what is the opportunity to recoup?

**Expert**
It's much less now, but it was around 10% of revenue.

**Client**
Given that context, are you now in a better spot with the solution that you are using, plus the proprietary software, or looking at any other specialty pharmacy or infusion solutions?

**Expert**
Yes. Now, we were able to maintain that at what we've determined a more acceptable level, which is in the single digits month-over-month. This was a large pain point for us. I cannot extrapolate to say that all infusion centers have this much pain, but it was something we had to fix very quickly.

**Client**
Do you mind digging into the third-party softwares and vendors that you have worked with to complement your in-house software?

**Expert**
Sure.

**Client**
Maybe we can you just go through which are the folks you're currently working with? Are there other folks that you evaluated before you made your decision? We can dig into the specifics of each of them.

Sure. We have this on our internal SharePoint.

**Client**
I think on the initial survey, there were a number of companies that you had responded to, Tennr, Mandolin, Tandem, Latent, and Thoughtful?

**Expert**
Yes. I'll pull away from pulling up the SharePoint. Again, no real surprises, there's only so many. When we discuss Tennr, for example, who we're working with and who we worked with in the past, beginning with Tennr. How would we like to focus the conversations with the limitations that they had, what they were able to bring, or why we need to move?

**Client**
As you evaluated each of these vendors, what was the acute problem that you were looking to solve with the vendors? What were the decision points in assessing if they're the right partner, and then ultimately, what your takeaways were from either a pilot that you ran, or if you're currently working with any of them?

**Expert**
There is no perfect system. There was bias based on what individuals' decision-makers have used in the past. Once we remove that, there were three components that were the main driving force. That was the operating components, the education component. What I mean by that is, as we look at these different vendors across the board, either we have them or we don't.

What is needed to implement them into our system that we currently have, and what level of support do we receive for these key operatives? What is the scalability? We have a very viable business. We make money, profits are good, everything is fine. As we're looking to double our footprint in the next 18 months and make it more of a scalable business model.

Again, we're a very viable model, but the scalability is limited on many of the platforms across the board. I don't want to speak in generalities, but as we look at it, the three buckets for all of them was, either we have it already or we don't. The implementation stays, how long does it take for this to implement within our current software or future software's?

What level of support is given and provided, not only from the education component, but the actual? When do these real updates come about, these new products, these new codes? How is that updated? What level of support? Concerning the reportability, is the bucket that was of a concern. Those were the reasons we built our own software for those reasons.

**Client**
Was there any element of domain focus or expertise that was important in your evaluation here? Meaning, companies that maybe have case studies or deploy customers they could speak to specifically with their boards, or was that not really a factor for you because you're just interested in evaluating more broadly along those three dimensions that you mentioned?

**Expert**
No, and thank you for calling out that level of detail. What we found, they were all able to bring those case vignettes. We evaluated it from proof of concept, speed of implementation, and reliability. All vendors were able to give, with limited amount.

It really went to their individual business model, their experience, their expertise, how we were able to provide what our individual pain points were, and how they were to solve it. They are all able to present and come in with that type of information. The factors, nonetheless, were, "Yes, and this would work at the revenue we're at now. Yes, this will work where we're at."

However, they may not have had the grand experience, but they have more of an entrepreneurial spirit and

they seem to accommodate and be receptive. They all fell flat on that because we truly wanted just to control as much as we could to get that level of reliability that we were looking for.

**Client**
When you say they all fell flat, that was across the specialty pharmacy and the infusion therapy side, both?

**Expert**
Yes. There was a much larger emphasis on the infusion side than the specialty side. The specialty side, it was more higher numbers as we were dispensing out larger volumes, much higher prescription count, and total amount of individuals. On the infusion side, it's much lower.

The cost of the therapies was so significantly higher that we really emphasized it was more of a numbers game, meaning that it was much larger amount of dispenses. Through our marketing, we were looking to expand those therapies, not only for rare disease but really capturing as much as we could. If you're taking care of one patient, why not take care of their family?

If you're taking care of one physician, go after the large group through the contracts. On the specialty side, we still use that same formula. It was just there's only so many patients that have these conditions that we're able to dispense out to, but each one is just a higher significance. When we lose through that, it's harder to recoup the loss of these therapies.

**Client**
We've heard different folks looking for either a solution that can handle both sides, the specialty pharmacy and infusion, or ones that are prioritizing, "I want something end to end that can cover everything from referral intake all the way to the whole billing cycle aspects for infusion or specialty pharmacy." Is that type of framework for whether you're interested in exploring different solutions on both sides, or you would want a consolidated platform?

**Expert**
One of the difficulties that we had was the interoperability of systems, where we were looking at most were focused either on infusion, most were focused and concentrated on specialty. The communication piece between both is where we were running at a stalemate, meaning that our operating systems are different.

The billing component, how those two systems would communicate, it was difficult. We were looking for a method of having internally, so they all go to one way. Even though different operating systems, where a patient come in and start on, like a Stelara or a Skyrizi, a therapy in which they are infused one to two times and then move to specialty and billed through the pharmacy benefits.

We found that we were unable to find a system that could accommodate our needs for both of those in that regard, for the revenue cycle management components. In the operating systems, different conversation. They didn't seem to provide that level that we wanted in an influx that we need. That's why we turned internal with our own internal systems.

**Client**
Are you currently working with folks like Mandolin?

**Expert**
Yes. We have not switched 100% yet, nor have we gave awareness to them to state, we're moving away from you. Let's dive into that. With Mandolin, what we found was the implementation, the support, great, but the visibility was lacking.

Meaning that, we're seeing on that the information was billed out but not captured. If it wasn't captured, what type of information, what type of cadence? They were unable to make changes as we made changes to make it a more scalable business. Their updates did not happen as fast as we would like.

**Client**
What were you changing that they couldn't accommodate?

**Expert**
Again, baseline and moving up toward it. The therapies, the classes, they did very well with that. As new therapies were coming out, they were able to make accommodations and changes. For ASP or AWP, the different products, a new therapy would come out.

We're finding that there was a lag between when CMS would come out with, "Here's the J-codes, here's the HCPCS, here's the billing codes," that their system was lagging in giving us better visibility to that when those changes did occur.

**Client**
This is the primary reason you plan to quit working with Mandolin and switch over to your proprietary system or to another vendor?

**Expert**
To our proprietary system. We found that they were very good at implementation, they were very good at support. When we were making internal changes, and I'll talk a little bit more about that, meaning that we wanted it reported back to us in a different format. They could make changes that, but they didn't make the changes fast enough for us.

**Client**
You had mentioned a familiarity with Thoughtful, Tennr, Tandem, Enlighten, and some of these others. Is that a common challenge across those other vendors? If you had to pick one that wasn't your proprietary system and you didn't have your own proprietary system, which one would you think would be the best fit for you?

**Expert**
That'd be the Tennr, as we mentioned, because it is able to provide that visibility for decisions. They accommodated the request and changes and updates, and they possessed great ownership when it wasn't occurring. They escalated it quickly, and all of them escalate. They're doing a good job.

The Tennr, and I've worked with them in a previous employer as well, they were able to provide baseline analysis for us, give visibility when there are discrepancies, provide reason and rationale why that occurred. As we demanded different style of reporting by, they accommodate it.

**Client**
Are you going to use Tennr plus your proprietary system and remove Mandolin, or are there any other changes to your tech stack as a whole then of what your plans are moving forward?

**Expert**
We'll get that implemented. We will make assessments, moving from a week-over-week, month-over-month, quarter-over-quarter, beginning in Q3. That's when we plan to move that. Everything wants to be done sooner, but it just can't be. That's the reality of where we sit.

**Client**
If you do proprietary system plus Tennr, where does the solution stop and end, or scope of work with Tennr versus your in-house solution?

**Expert**
Sure. We'll use Tennr more on the front end of the revenue cycle management, and then our own on the back end, ensuring that the collections are in sync so that we can own it, with an eventual fade-out of Tennr

altogether.

**Client**
You plan to build your proprietary system to take over the front end as well?

**Expert**
We got acquired. We're profitable. It would be interest to have people interested in our software.

**Client**
Given that spend with Tennr, how much are you spending with Mandolin today?

**Expert**
About 1/3.

**Client**
Is it a full engineering team you've built in-house to build this down? How much did the overall system cost you?

**Expert**
We have our own internal engineers, and we're using a nearshore company to help build the platform. We moved from an offshore, which was based mostly in India, to a nearshore company incorporation with bases out of Mexico and the Caribbean states. The reason why we went to those specifically, Sonatafy, I believe is the name of the vendor to help us build that.

At the time, what we found there was a great amount of lapse between the communication for the offshore companies to the nearshore companies. We could have a real-time meeting at 8:00 A.M. instead of working, starting at 2:00 A.M. or 6:00 A.M. or 4:00 A.M.

**Client**
How much does that overall cost you then per year, let's say, or initial upfront investment in any maintenance cost?

**Expert**
Sure. The total span we're going to build around multiple millions for the investments, is what it was built out for this component. That's broken down by building, implementation, and then the scalability and support.

**Client**
That's few million million per year, or that was a one-time fixed cost estimate?

**Expert**
One-time to build. We're matching it with our overall spend, we are hoping to keep it within 30% of what we were spending in the other components. It is adding to our overall cost because headcount has to increase overall, supporting structure, security, and things, but because of our increase of revenue, would make up for it, is the reason and rationale. We had to wait to hit a certain level of threshold and revenue and margins before moving to our own to make it fixable.

**Client**
There are usually more components underlying some of these solutions that I'd love to talk through in more granularly. For example, a company like Mandolin covers end-to-end referral intake and entry, benefits verification, out-of-pocket estimation, prior authorization, financial assistance, scheduling, and RCM and this full capability.

When I rattle off all these different components, you mentioned and simplified in front end of RCM and back

end of RCM, but that usually, the definitions are different at different customers. Are all of these things covered with the proprietary system and Tennr at the moment then? Assuming you let go of Mandolin and Tennr, are there other vendors in the mix to cover some aspects of these?

**Expert**
Not that I have awareness of that the other vendors would be able to cover those. The current systems, as you break it down into the more granular, we are covered in that, and as we transition to those very specific granular components, taking it on in-house is the key to our success there.

**Client**
You plan to do it all in-house, although not all of it is fully built today. Is that fair?

**Expert**
Yes.

**Client**
Which of those components is most painful, in terms of capabilities, are the hardest, represent the most painful pain points for you all? Referral entry, benefit verification, out-of-pocket estimation, prior auth, financial assistance, that's the pharma portal to get patients assistance and scheduling and RCM on the backside.

**Expert**
Yes. As you label those out in those three buckets, the pharma portal, the intake, and the collections, what we're finding with the largest pain point is the collections components, the RCM on the collection side. Leveraging on the front end, those pharma portals, those support services that we have in pharma, it is a much larger lift, but with the adequate supports, the letters of investigation, and all the very specific goes through, that takes longer.

Once it's up and running, then it's sustainable where you have the key components put together. The largest pain point for us, and the reason, the rationale for moving forward with our own was that collection phase, and more importantly, the visibility of the collection phase. There was misses that we didn't quite understand until diving into it.

**Client**
When you say with adequate support, the pharma portals and things like that, it takes longer but you can cover it, that's more manually and not trying to automate it. Is that fair?

**Expert**
Yes, it is.

**Client**
Are there any of those other components that you're handling manually versus with automation?

**Expert**
No, that's it. We've been using artificial intelligence in the last six months to really help us in those processes, to help identify and just process quicker and smarter.

**Client**
That's including the scheduling portion too?

**Expert**
Yes.

**Client**
Based on the fact that you've addressed the 10% to 12% leakage and brought it down to 1% to 2%, how long did it take you to get to that outcome?

**Expert**
It took us, I believe, over six months.

**Client**
Just to clarify, you were able to get the proprietary in-house system up and running in six months?

**Expert**
No. That was after we built it and got it up. I want to be clear on that. It took us probably a year to identify, build, pilot, and then once we got up and running, it was six months. Quite a while, it wasn't that fast, unfortunately.

**Client**
It sounds like AleraCare has made the decision to build internally. It sounds like you've spent quite a bit of time in this space. How would you characterize the types of sites that would choose to partner with folks like Mandolin versus build capabilities internally like you all have decided to do?

**Expert**
Absolutely. We put them into more regional players and more national players. Your national players will have a coast-to-coast with a high infrastructure. That's going to be your Optum, Optum Rx, and the like, where your more regional players, BioMatrix, AleraCare and some of the others are more positioned in more regional areas that accompany for specific geographic areas.

Those in the smaller geographic areas, those regional players, will most likely need to have an outsourced company. Those additional be utilized. The revenue just isn't there and the personnel just isn't there. They still have much smaller site. Those sites that are below 20 sites total, 20-25.

It's going to be more difficult to have an infrastructure in place starting with leadership to create and implement. It's best served once they hit certain revenue thresholds.

The best way to hit those revenue thresholds is just to have more sites, because again, most of the more regional players, their chair time, they're going to have one to two to three, four, five, six, something like four to six chairs at some of these different sites and centers in different geographic location.

As we extrapolate out the number of sites that they have, the amount of revenue would best determine what their next course of business would be. Revenue cycle is on the lower end of need, but without proper attention, there's lack.

Those supportive services will be able to support until they hit a threshold. For many, it could be lower. It has to be economically sound to make those decisions, so differentiating between your more regional players and your more national players.

**Client**
It sounds like, just to play that back, the smaller 20-25 sites and below, those folks are more likely to outsource it versus even regional players that are larger, like AleraCare. The national players, given the size, scale, they'd likely internalize the buildout of these sorts of RCM tools.

**Expert**
That's correct.

The market itself is changing very quickly. Do you have a sense of the breakdown of the market, either by count or by dollars spend across those national versus regional or sub-25 sites overall? Do you have a rough sense?

**Expert**
From a rough sense, the scalability of those regional players, those national players still, because they're based mostly on chronic therapies, those therapies that are determined and ultimately the buy-and-build model, those individuals that are discharged from hospital, large clinics, and things, those regional players are still going to own the lion's share of over 60% of the orders coming out in the patient population.

While there's a trend, more of these regional players, as they're growing and they're interoperative and they're able to give a higher level, concierge-level of care.

That could be either because they're merging or growing like us. We're growing and buying others smaller, and many of the others are doing the same. They're going in and buying 10 and 12 so that their numbers increase, with the ultimate working with the manufacturers, working with the different therapeutic class providers.

**Client**
Just to clarify, the 60% you mentioned is a lion's share going to the regional players, but is that also including the national players overall, or is that separate? Are you breaking down into three categories or two?

**Expert**
Two categories.

**Client**
The national players, you're saying, will have about 40%?

**Expert**
Eventually, yes. They're going to switch over. The national players currently a state-to-state, they have more bodies covered because most are owned by an insurance provider, and so they already have total lives under management. They're going to own 60% of the market. As we look at it holistically, the regional players will be at that 40%, as we look at it wholly.

As we dive into the regional players, like AleraCare and BioMatrix and some of these others, they are overtaking some of those regional areas and taking away from the national in certain geographic areas. We're seeing it occurring as it goes across the U.S. as we break it up.

**Client**
Just to clarify, you previously said a different number, but national players is the lion's share of 60%, and then the regional players is now the 40%?

**Expert**
That's correct.

**Client**
If you play this out because the market is shifting quickly, in the next five years, let's say, do you expect that breakdown to shift?

**Expert**
Yes.

If so, how?

**Expert**
Yes. The regional players are growing larger, and they're taking over the different geographic areas. That shifting will decrease from those national players to the regional players having ownership, and more than the national players.

**Client**
If you had to get the estimate of the players that have less than 25 sites or less than that $100 million threshold, do you have a rough estimate count? How many players would fall in that bucket?

**Expert**
Certainly, about six. Probably it will be less than 10.

**Client**
Less than 10 in the sub-25 sites, less than 25 sites?

**Expert**
Yes.

**Client**
How many are you counting for the national players and the regional players then?

**Expert**
The national players, there's around three to four. The regional, in those larger sites, there's around six or so that are fairly large and are growing.

**Client**
Okay. Thank you again for taking the time to speak with us today. This was very helpful. Enjoy the rest of your day.
