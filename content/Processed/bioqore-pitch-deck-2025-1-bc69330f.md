## Slide 2: The Problem

Fragmented Data Slows Biomanufacturing

**1. Wasted capacity**
*   Billions of dollars in U.S. biomanufacturing infrastructure sit idle.
*   Every tech transfer or scale-up takes months because data, processes, and labs do not talk to each other.

**2. Broken feedback loops**
*   Scientists cannot see what is working. Experimental data lives in spreadsheets instead of systems, so every new run starts from scratch.

**3. Global Pressure**
While other countries adopt unified, data-driven manufacturing, U.S. teams still rely on manual workflows and guesswork.

## Slide 4: Our Vision: Autonomous Biomanufacturing

Bioqore is building the AI layer that transforms biomanufacturing into a continuous learning system.

**Relevance**
*   Bioqore serves both preclinical and clinical programs.
*   In early R&D it identifies optimal conditions fast.
*   In clinical scale-up it ensures those conditions transfer reliably.

**How data changes everything**
*   Today, process data is fragmented and reactive.
*   Bioqore unifies that data, learns from every run, and automatically designs and executes the next experiment.
*   Each cycle improves the model, accelerating development and increasing yield.

**Goal**
*   Create the first self-optimizing biomanufacturing loop where data, AI, and automation work together to cut timelines from years to months and boost productivity across all stages.
*   AI and automation are finally mature enough to close the loop in biomanufacturing.

## Slide 5: Current Case Study: From Years to Months

Proven to Cut Timelines from Years to Months

**The Challenge**
*   Mid-sized biotherapeutics company spent $1.5M+ and waited 12+ months with no results from a foreign CDMO.

**What Bioqore Delivers**
*   Bioqore scale-up in ~8 months at <25% of the cost.
*   Yields improved by 80% with unified, data-driven processes.

**The Impact**
*   Converts wasted time and capital into faster commercialization, saving $1M+ and cutting years off timelines.

## Slide 6: Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

**Primary Buyer**
Process Development Directors or Heads of Bioprocessing at small-to-mid biopharma and CDMOs (Contract Development and Manufacturing Organizations).

**Why they care**
*   They're under pressure to hit yield targets (e.g., 1.0 g/L → 1.5-2.0 g/L).
*   Their teams lose months optimizing media and process conditions manually.
*   They lack integrated software tools for experiment planning or data reuse.
*   Outsourced CDMOs are slow, opaque, and expensive – they want control and visibility.

**Target Segments**
*   **Therapeutic Biotechs** developing biologics, enzymes, cell-based products (Series A–C stage).
*   **CDMOs** wanting faster client delivery and predictive analytics.
*   **SynBio and Industrial Biotech Firms** optimizing fermentation, protein yields, or strain performance.

## Slide 7: Business Model

**Article:** "Accelerating cell culture media development using Bayesian optimization-based iterative experimental design"
*   **Authors:** Harini Narayanan, Joshua A. Hinckley, Rachel Barry, Brendan Dang, Lenna A. Wolffe, Adel Atari, Yuen-Yi Tseng & J. Christopher Love
*   **Received:** 9 December 2024
*   **Accepted:** 13 June 2025

**Summary of Article Abstract:**
Optimizing operational conditions for complex biological systems in life sciences research and biotechnology is an arduous task. Here, we apply a Bayesian Optimization-based iterative framework for experimental design to accelerate cell culture media development for two applications. First, we show that this approach yields new compositions of media with cytokine supplementation to maintain the viability and distribution of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells in the culture. Second, we apply this framework to optimize the production of three recombinant proteins in cultivations of K.phaffii. We identified conditions with improved outcomes for both applications compared to the initial standard media using 3-30 times fewer experiments than that estimated for other methods such as the standard Design of Experiments. Subsequently, we also demonstrated the extensibility of our approach to efficiently account for additional design factors through transfer learning. These examples demonstrate how coupling data collection, modeling, and optimization in this iterative paradigm, while using an exploration-exploitation trade-off in each iteration, can reduce the time and resources for complex optimization tasks such as the one demonstrated here.
