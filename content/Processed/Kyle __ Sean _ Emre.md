	- Traditional Series A ($12-15M for 20-25% dilution)
	- Smaller insider-led round ($5-6M in low 40s valuation)
- Going to committee with two firms today
- Likely to receive 1-2 term sheets in next 48-72 hours
- Strong market pull with verbal interest and signed logos
- Management focused on back half of year (buying season)
