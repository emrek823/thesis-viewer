# Ambience Healthcare, Inc. - Associate Medical Director of Informatics of Emergency Services at a Clinic

**Interview conducted on May 15, 2025**

## Topics
- Emergency Medicine
- Compliance
- Family Medicine
- Customer Service
- Medical Decision Making
- Data Analytics
- Billing Accuracy
- Product Recommendation

## Summary
The Tegus Client discussed the comparison between Ambience and Abridge coding products with an expert, focusing on customer service, product development, coding accuracy, smart data elements, customization options, compliance, and vendor evaluation. The expert emphasized Ambience's real-time feedback, two-way communication, co-development, and proactive approach in capturing accurate information for billing and coding. Ambience's product is live in the ambulatory setting and being piloted in the emergency department, with plans for expansion. The expert highlighted coding as a long-term differentiator for Cleveland Clinic, eventually saving money and streamlining processes, and expressed a higher likelihood of recommending Ambience over Abridge due to their collaborative efforts and multiple touchpoints for improvement.

## Expert Details
**Associate Medical Director of Informatics of Emergency Services at Cleveland Clinic**
Sean Doolan
sd@virtuevc.com

The expert is responsible for emergency medicine, focused on clinical and informatics work. The expert oversees 29 emergency departments. This includes implementing new tools, order sets, and onboarding new departments as well.

Delegate to the AMA at Ohio State Medical Association. Responsibilities included carrying the concerns of Ohio students, residents, and physicians to the AMA, identifying real-world situations potentially addressed by creating new AMA policy, and communicating the proceedings of the meetings to Ohio State Medical Association (OSMA) members.

## Client
Hello, thank you so much for taking the time to meet with me today. To start off we want to talk about the Ambience. Just want to get the update on that and all those processes that are moving. I think we want to spend more time around the E&#x26;M coding piece and how Ambience thinks about compliance relative to other vendors. On the coding piece, would love to just get your early perspective on how much that moved the needle for you, what you were seeing from other vendors in the category, and how good the product is.

## Expert
Sure. In terms of coding, certainly, this is something that everybody is moving to, some quicker than others. I think that Ambience and Abridge both have decent coding products. I'm not sure how much I'm allowed to get into about the specifics of our contract, but it's not something that we had enabled initially. There was some confusion as to whether or not that was initially included with our license. In terms of functionality, both seem to work pretty similarly. I think that that's important for environments where doctors are doing their own coding.

I know a lot of family medicine doctors, for example, at the end of their visits, enter in a level of service, and especially some ICD-10 codes. A lot of the EMRs have some built-in tools to suggest billing levels. Not all of them do. My work in our emergency department is a little bit different. Emergency medicine as a specialty,

we aren't expected to do our own coding. The care is too fast-paced.

There's a lot of pretty high-level things that happen that might be a little bit more difficult to capture than just your typical ambulatory care visit. That is still sent to a billing company for us. We have not yet done the A/B comparison to see if our billing company is capturing at a higher level than Ambience. At least some rough back of the napkin math shows that it's pretty good. I'd say 85% there maybe.

**Client**
Yes. Just to understand, how much did this move the needle in actually getting you all signed up? When you're comparing Ambience and Abridge, did you think Ambience coding products?

**Expert**
That was not important consideration for us. I think probably the thing that moved the needle for the enterprise for us was customer service and how willing they were to be partners with us in terms of co-development and making sure that this solution met our needs. I can say, from that standpoint, I've been very satisfied with Ambience.

**Client**
Yes. What do you mean by customer service exactly and with the products that they're willing to build and things like that?

**Expert**
Turnaround time has been fantastic. They have the capability from within their product to submit real-time feedback and not just one-off form. It disappears into the ether, real two-way communications with somebody on their team to troubleshoot issues in real time. That was very unique to this product. Nobody else really offered that service. In terms of co-development, we have so many unique needs in the emergency department that I think I spoke to during our last call.

I've had two meetings with them this week already just on working out some of those challenges and making sure the product meets our needs. I think their exec team is coming out, two weeks from today actually, to meet with us in person and really make sure that before our full emergency department go live, this is satisfactory. We have had some one-off talks and exchanged emails with the other vendors but nobody has offered the level of support that Ambience has.

**Client**
Got it. What's the footprint of Ambience today? Which departments is it live in? I imagine you don't have anything in the emergency department quite yet.

**Expert**
We have a pilot. It is very small and in development but it is almost completely live in the ambulatory setting. Of course, it went out to family medicine and a few of specialties first. It's been expanded. I think the next one that's coming on is hematology, oncology but they want to fully saturate the ambulatory space to the tune of, I think they have 3,800 physicians that have completed training so far in the ambulatory setting. That's a pretty decent chunk of docs using this product.

**Client**
That makes sense to me. Did Abridge have an ED product at the time or still working on it as well? Did Abridge have an ED product as well?

**Expert**
No. None of the vendors that we tested, except for the Time app by Dr. Haydar, had anything geared towards the ED.

Yes. I think on the EDs, we mostly understand the differences, but just want to clarify. You're going to have multiple speakers, multiple physicians talking at the same time. You have a lot of background noise, things are dynamic. You need to note the change in real time as different things happen. You also need very specific timing for each event. You can structure things into billing. Is there anything that I'm missing there, and the key product differences between ED and ambulatory?

**Expert**
Yes. All of the products did pretty well with multiple speakers, especially if you introduce them at the beginning. It is pretty amazing. I tested Abridge and Ambience in our very noisy open room, low-acuity area that has probably 20 patients in it and family members, they're all talking together, how all the products are able to filter out conversations of that particular patient. Unique to the ED is the multiple touchpoints for an encounter. Ambulatory, you walk into your family medicine doc's office. They launch your history, they do a physical exam, they come up with a treatment plan while in the room and then they leave and you never see them again, the encounter's over.

It's pretty easy for all of these software to do at the moment. What's challenging in my situation is, in my emergency department for multiple hours, they receive multiple reevaluations, and as we get test results back in real time, I might say, "You're coming here with shortness of breath. Is that due to pneumonia? Is that due to pneumothorax? Is that due to a pulmonary embolism? Is it due to a heart attack?"

At the beginning, I want the note to state all of that. As the test results come back, as I reevaluate the patient, say, "Oh, your X-ray is negative. I know this isn't pneumonia or pneumothorax." I want it to be able to update that, if not in real time, at least during defined time periods. That is a challenge for all of the products that exist currently.

Ambience, I think, is coming up with a reasonable solution. I think we're up to three touchpoints now for encounters. We have an HPI and then a medical decision making, then an imaging and laboratory studies section, which is progress. I don't think it's where we're going to end up. I think it's going to continue to evolve, but that, at least, gets us a minimally viable product that the other vendors didn't have.

**Client**

sd@virtuevc.com
What were the three touchpoints of HPI lab/imaging? The one in the middle is what?

**Expert**
We call it our medical decision-making. It's a unique EM term. Assessment and plan would be the best equivalent in the other specialties, but I don't really care what the end cause of the chest pain is. The only thing that matters in terms of complexity of billing and then also protecting us medical legally, if this patient was to have an adverse outcome, is your thought process. We put a lot of time and effort into explaining our thought processes and writing during the encounter.

**Client**
That makes sense to me. Did the presence of having any ED product at all? Relative to Abridge, did they not have one move the needle?

**Expert**
Not really. The decision was made before the announcement of any of these ED products. We did pilot them in the ED setting anyways. We shoehorned their product into our current situation, and we're going to pilot them, which wasn't bad. They all do a decent job of the history and physical. I think what did move the needle was their willingness to work with us, the customer service.

**Client**
Got it. Do you know if they have rolled out a broader inpatient product as well?

**Expert**
Yes. In fact, I expect the inpatient team to maybe get this product before the ED. We'll see how the timing.

lines up. It's going to be pretty close. They might be deployed concurrently, but the inpatient doesn't have as many challenges as we do in terms of the multiple touchpoints. One unique challenge to them is at least at my institution, which the mothership is a very large academic medical center, a lot of the care is provided by residents and fellows. You need to be able to have multiple physicians' interface with this note and not overwrite each other's stacations from the Ambience software.

**Client**
Got it. At the time of the evaluation, was there a big gap between Ambience and Abridge at the product level, or were they pretty similar products and service was the biggest differentiator?

**Expert**
They are pretty similar. There are some little differences. I tested Ambience after Abridge and I think the Abridge product had continued to evolve after I tested it. I did think that Ambience was ahead, but it wasn't a true apples to apples comparison. Launching from Haiku is pretty useful. Abridge might have a slight advantage there. Are you guys familiar with Haiku?

**Client**
Yes. The Epic mobile app.

**Expert**
Exactly. That is pretty useful. I can also launch Ambience now from Haiku. There was just an extra initiation step at the beginning. It took two minutes.

**Client**
Makes sense to me. Thinking about the long-term vision with Cleveland Clinic here, do you think coding will be a long-term differentiator here?

**Expert**
Yes. That is not important to us right now at all.
**DO NOT COPY**
We have a separate company, and they're doing great. Five or 10 years from now, it would seem asinine if anybody was hiring a medical transcription company and actual real humans to sift through these charts and extract the relevant codes and submit the appropriate level of service. There's just no way that is going to happen.

I think it is something that we really want to develop, and it's going to save us a ton of money eventually because we will be able to consolidate multiple different subscriptions and products that we are paying for now into this one product. That would be everything from patient discharge instructions to the billing and coding to the manual dictation software that we use. Ambience does have what they call core dictation mode, I think is what they are calling it, where, essentially, instead of getting the AI interpretation of what you are saying, you can say, "I want this dictated word for word. This exact language is important to me."

**Client**
Yes. It's not saving you money, yet eventually will. Do you think they'll also create net new revenue for you, as in sometimes, you're under coding or the coding company is under coding and Ambience will have better context so it will properly code?

**Expert**
I'm aiming for parity. Our coders are pretty good. This is all they do is emergency medicine coding, at least the service that we use. They're pretty good at lifting every bit of relevant information. If we had parity, that would be great. Part of the reason why they're so good is because we've built smart data elements and analytics into all of our coding so that our medical directors can see, at a glance, who is underperforming and what specific areas out of, I don't know, I think we probably have 300 smart data elements in our notes.

Not that all of those are important, but they could see who's hitting what compared to what their level of service is and do some individual coaching. None of the products have that right now, but that is something

that Ambience is actively working on with us, embed those smart data elements into different components of their formed notes. At least at a basic level, we've been able to replicate some of that. Definitely not all of it, but Abridge was not willing to do that for us at all.

**Client**
They weren't willing to do what?

**Expert**
They weren't willing to work with data and analytics to help us capture relevant bits of information so that we could use that for more accurate billing and coding.

**Client**
What does that mean exactly? They were unwilling to work with your data team internally to get to the bottom of the code.

**Expert**
We have attached certain trackers, or what we call smart data elements to bits of our note, to relevant important sections that we found through billing and coding. If you want to build a higher level of service, you really need to be interpreting your own X-rays, for example, or you really need to be documenting these conversations that you're having with consultants in the emitting team. Right now, doing that manually, we're able to capture all of that. Ambience is willing to also help us capture that in a structured way that allows us to extract that for billing and coding.

I think the other products, if we dictated, "Yes. I spoke to Dr. XYZ, the surgeon who's going to perform surgery tomorrow," it would capture that information in prose form in the note. Would there necessarily be a smart data element attached to that so we could see, at a glance, who's documenting those specific conversations needed for a high level of billing and coding? No. It was not on Abridge's radar.

Before, when we mentioned that to them, they Sean Doolan did not seem interested in pursuing that. Nothing more came with those conversations, whereas even with our conversations last November with Ambience, before the decisions were made, they said, "Yes. This is something that we haven't thought about, but something we could probably do." Here we are, three months after we've signed this contract. Some of that's coming to fruition. That's nice.

**Client**
Is that a scalable thing that you think Ambience can use for another health system, or is that smart data element process and structuring all of that, very idiosyncratic to your guys' process?

**Expert**
I think other health systems would be fools not to utilize this. I know that many organizations, even within the Cleveland Clinic, in the family medicine clinics, they have no idea what their docs are charting. They just don't have insight into any of that. I think that's part of why our particular institute has been so successful compared to others within the clinic. I do think that it's scalable. I think that it would be useful to other people. Now, whether or not they even know that they need to be doing that is a whole other question. They would be able to bill at a higher rate if they followed our model.

**Client**
That makes sense to me. Do you know why Abridge chose not to do that?

**Expert**
No. I think their focus was just elsewhere. They really wanted to develop a great ambulatory product. I sat on a panel at an American Medical Association next to the CMO of Abridge. She and I are recent acquaintances. I even approached her with some of our specific needs, and I thought meaningful feedback to improve their product. Unfortunately, despite that pretty high level access to their organization, they didn't move forward.

with that stuff at the time. I think their software is really user friendly. It's easy. I think it does a decent job.
In terms of getting to that next level. I'm glad we made the decision that we did.

## Client
Got it. In one way or another coding was part of the decision not to leave the witness here, but more so the prospect of coding down the line but not coding in its current format.

## Expert
Yes. I would say the prospect of capturing accurate relevant bits of information was a factor in the decision and I hope that in the future, we can use that to ensure more accurate coding with Abridge's product. For now, we're going to use that to ensure more accurate coding with our own. Like I said, in five or 10 years, nobody's going to be using a coding company.

## Client
That makes a lot of sense to me. Also, want to understand compliance a bit more. We've heard that Ambience provides more compliant documentation in that it captures every word exactly right. Everything in a document can be used for justification to payers when you do decide to bill. They provide this audit report at the end of each pilot that proves it out. Are you familiar with this compliance piece at all?

## Expert
Not in the sense that you're speaking about it. In terms of accuracy of what you're saying being transcribed into the note, the two are equivalent. Compliance to me means what's actually done with this data behind the scenes, how is it kept confidential, how is it disposed of, how much of that would be discoverable by a jury after the fact if there was an adverse outcome.

I can't speak a ton about that with Abridge because I just wasn't involved far enough in that process to know specifically how they handled things. With Ambience, I'm pretty satisfied. The actual recordings are deleted after a short period of time. The unedited initial transcription notes are held onto for a while. Ultimately, what's submitted isn't that AI-generated note. It's the one that goes through revisions by the physician.

## Client
Yes. Do you have any anecdotal data, things that you have heard about it?

## Expert
I can see if I can find some. They send out, every other day, summaries of physician utilization. I wonder if that is included in there. This is just a good list and naughty list of who was using it and who's completed training but isn't actually using it.

## Client
Okay. Was there anything that would make you want to try Abridge again or switch to Abridge in the future?

## Expert
I think if they put some serious effort into making a high-level emergency product that would allow really granular customization per user, that would be beneficial. I think both products allow some customization now. Abridge might have actually allowed customization before Ambience, now that I think about it, in terms of if you want your notes structured in throws or bulleted points, certainly, you want patients referred the patient, for example. They bridge a lot from high-level customization first, and Ambience now has that built in.

If they made a really granular one where you could say, "In my physical exam, for an ear, nose, and throat complaint, I always hit these three things. For a chest pain complaint, I always hit these couple of things." Right now, they allow some preferences in terms of just a generic physical exam.

Part of the reason why us docs are so fast in Epic is because I have 12 different physical exam templates for

# Document Transcript

## Expert Interview

### Client
Got it. I think maybe last thing, Nuance/DAX. Would love your opinion there. Were they a serious vendor in that evaluation?

### Expert
I think they were the first one that we piloted. Some of this might be the stage of development of the product when we piloted it, because the other ones did come a few months later. As quickly as this space is changing, those couple of months could have made a big difference. I was not super impressed with the performance of the product or the cost. I want to say it was 4 figures per user per month or something like that. It was outrageous at the time.

Back when they were first thinking about DAX, this was, I don't know, maybe 2022 or 2023 maybe, they had said, "Yes. We want you guys to pilot this for us. You can have 10 users. You only have to pay us X amount to help beta test this product for us for a few months." It was outrageous, especially considering the performance. It took a very long time to generate those notes. Initially, it was like a 24-hour turnaround almost. That has improved considerably. They're no longer using real humans to transcribe these like they were in the initial to check their model. It's gotten a lot faster, but still, Ambience and Abridge haven't beat.

### Client
Yes. I think we did this exercise before, but just wanted to capture again. On a scale of 1-10, how likely would you be to recommend Ambience to a friend or colleague?

### Expert
I'd say eight, maybe a nine. I forget what number I gave before, but I'm really coming around. They've impressed me with their willingness to work with us. We had a stand-up meeting today internally and three of their developers just showed up to see if there was anything that they could help us with, which is pretty amazing.

### Client
Got it. What about Abridge?

### Expert
Five, probably six. I'd say a nine for Ambience and a six for Abridge.

### Client
Got it. That's mostly just their willingness to work with you on these things?

### Expert
In the multiple touchpoints. They've already made some big strides on that. We're up to three. Abridge is still on one, which is valuable. Not just for the emergency department, but if you're a doc that does a lot of pre-charting or additional documentation after you finish the patient encounter, having multiple touchpoints is important.

### Client
Awesome. Thank you so much for chatting. I really appreciate it. Have a good one.
