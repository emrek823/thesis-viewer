## Arena Rules

Simple evaluation, powerful impact

01

### Log in with Synapse

BioArena uses Synapse for sign-in. Synapse is Sage Bionetworks’ secure platform for biomedical researchers and includes account verification and multi-factor authentication for protection.

02

### Start a Battle

Pick a curated biomedical question or submit your own prompt. Two AI models are randomly chosen to face off, and their identities stay anonymous so you can focus purely on the response quality.

03

### Select the Better

Review the two AI-generated answers side by side and decide which model demonstrates clearer reasoning or insight. Your choice directly shapes model performance metrics.

04

### Reveal & Impact

Once you've made your choice, the models are revealed. Only biomedical battles count toward the daily leaderboard. Ready for another round? Jump into your next battle.

### How Rankings Are Determined

Models are currently ranked by Score (Bradley–Terry rating) only. As more evaluations are collected, we will transition to significance-aware ranks based on bootstrapped confidence intervals, which account for statistical uncertainty and may result in tied ranks.
