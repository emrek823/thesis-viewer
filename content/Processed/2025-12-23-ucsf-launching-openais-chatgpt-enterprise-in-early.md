As UCSF Chancellor Sam Hawgood announced on Friday, Nov. 7, 2025, in his annual State of the University address, an enterprise version of OpenAI’s ChatGPT will be available at UCSF early next year.

ChatGPT Enterprise is a data-secure AI platform powered by OpenAI’s latest AI models, including GPT-5. Building on the success of UCSF's Versa platform for private and secure access to generative AI, our ChatGPT deployment will have enterprise-grade safeguards—including enhanced HIPAA compliance support—and will amplify AI capabilities across our clinical, research, and education mission areas, including administrative functions.

UCSF’s ChatGPT Enterprise will replace UCSF’s Versa Chat (Web and iOS) and will be available on Web, iOS, and Android, enabling the UCSF community to utilize the industry’s most advanced AI platform while maintaining user privacy and the security of our data. Our ~9,000 current UCSF Versa Chat (Web and iOS) users will be migrated to UCSF’s ChatGPT Enterprise in early 2026 and should continue to use Versa Chat until then. We will migrate the 100+ Versa Assistants in a subsequent phase.  We will assess the migration of the 100+ Versa Assistants in a subsequent phase. The timeline will be announced soon, along with information on OpenAI training opportunities.

Please note that UCSF’s Versa API will continue to provide secure API access to large language models from multiple model vendors (AWS and Azure) and developers (Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.).
