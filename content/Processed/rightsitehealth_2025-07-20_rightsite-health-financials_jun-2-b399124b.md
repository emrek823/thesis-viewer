### Overview and MD&A

Net revenue came in $8.9K below forecast due to higher reserves. SG&A was again under forecast, driven by slower hiring.

We finalized Texas case rate terms with Molina, effective July 15. Other forecasted payor start dates remain our best estimate.

Patient care costs fell for the second straight month, reflecting tighter management of Care Team compensation and more precise delivery of services based on insurance coverage and patient disposition (e.g., transportation, redirection to urgent care). We're onboarding Navigators carefully ahead of new EMS launches in Fort Worth (DFW) and Gwinnett County (ATL).

In Q3, we'll pilot the use of nurse extenders to offload time-consuming Care Team tasks, like prescription processing, which should increase physician and navigator capacity and reduce the cost per episode.

### MD&A

#### June Snapshot

*   Activations ended the month slightly above forecast, driven by higher call volume in Texas. Our new EMS partner in Beaumont is performing well, and SAFD came in ahead of expectations.
*   Diversions ended the month higher by 5% due to a higher diversion rate in Texas.

#### July Snapshot - Instituted a capacity model to support accelerated new volume and inform the remainder of 2025 go-live scheduling.

*   **Georgia** - We continue to expand ATL MSA coverage. Gwinnett and Cherokee Counties are still in contracting, targeting Q4 launches. Dougherty County Fire (Albany), has scheduled go live August and Columbus Dispatch has slotted October.
*   **Texas** - Fort Worth Fire goes live in mid-August with a newly instituted volume-ramp implementation to support an estimated 80/day Several DFW EMS agencies are following their lead including Dallas Fire, Garland Fire, Carrollton Fire driving DFW metro saturation. Bell County (Temple/Killeen) is launching in September, and additional I-35 corridor EMS agencies have followed in discussion. Montgomery County (North Houston) entered into contracting providing dispatch access to 20+ rural agencies.
*   **Florida** - Florida is gaining traction. We continue contracting with Palm Beach and entered into contracting with Gainesville County. Active discussions continue in Orlando, Tampa, and the Tallahassee region.

### MD&A

In June 628 (66%) of Telehealth Calls included known insurance coverage. Of the the 628, we were able to bill 458 FFS + Case Rate episodes ("Submitted for Billing"), or 73%.

*   115 claims (18%) were in the "No Current Contract" category, a slight increase to May (16%). Top plans in this group were:
    *   Cigna: 38 (33%)
    *   Oscar: 32 (28%)
    *   Humana TX: 15 (13%)
*   One physician still in credentialing accounted for 68% of the "Physician Not Effective” claims (25 total). We're focused on finalizing effective dates and tightening staffing schedules to reduce credentialing-related billing gaps. In the meantime, we're leveraging locum tenens rules to allow new physicians to bill under their predecessor to maintain continuity and revenue capture.
*   We may get retro effective dates for some case rate contract negotiations, but that is payor dependent.
*   Uninsured/Unknown/Other made up 34% of telehealth calls, in line with prior months. We're resubmitting these claims after month-end and recovering insurance coverage for about 10%, which we then bill. Starting in August, we'll partner with PointCare (an 8VC introduction) to support retroactive enrollment for uninsured patients.

### MD&A

A lower mix of patients with contracted RightSite coverage drove a shortfall in billable claims, resulting in a negative variance.

#### FFS Claims

Claim volume missed forecast: Medicaid 52 claims (-28%), Medicare 36 claims (-19%), Commercial 29 claims (-19%)
*   In Georgia, the shortfall was broadly spread across the payors
*   In Texas, total volume was in line with forecast

#### Case Rate Claims

*   Most of the negative variance was due to Georgia (20) with Humana, CareSource, and Centene being the primary drivers
*   Texas case rates were close to forecast (negative variance of 6), with Community First the driver

*   Net Revenue / Episode was $89, a negative variance (-$11) per episode
    *   Georgia was nearly in line with forecast while Texas was below due to reserve activity
*   Patient Care Cost / Episode was a positive variance ($46) per episode. Compensation across the Care Team was a positive variance to forecast and transportation costs came in below forecast and prior months due to tighter controls on which patients are offered the transportation resource.
