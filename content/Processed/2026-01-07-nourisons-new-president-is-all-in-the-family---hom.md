Saddle Brook, NJ – Meet the next generation of [Nourison](https://www.nourison.com/).

[Andrew Peykar](https://www.hfndigital.com/tag/andrew-peykar/ "Posts tagged with Andrew Peykar"), the first-born of [Nourison](https://www.hfndigital.com/tag/nourison/ "Posts tagged with Nourison")‘s second generation, has transitioned into a leadership role ahead of the family-owned-and-operated company’s 40th anniversary in 2020.

His C-suite promotion is more than three decades in the making.

“I’ve been working here since I was 14 years old,” he told HTT. “My first job was doing whatever my dad told me to do, from washing the dishes to cleaning the bathrooms.”

Andrew Peykar

A few years later, upon graduating from college, Peykar joined the company full time. While he calls himself a jack of all trades, Peykar’s strengths are in the technological, logistical and operational upgrades.

“I registered our website, Nourison.com, in September 1985, two months after Amazon.com launched,” he noted. “I built our first two websites myself.

He is also credited with establishing the company’s Calhoun, Ga., and [Las Vegas](https://www.hfndigital.com/tag/las-vegas/ "Posts tagged with Las Vegas") warehousing facilities. The Calhoun site, which measures 435,000 square feet, opened in 2005. And the Las Vegas site, which encompasses 120,000 square feet, went live Sept. 1.

“Those were fun projects,” Peykar said fondly. “I really enjoyed them because they took me out of my scope and challenged me to think differently.”

Peykar said his long and varied tenure at Nourison have afforded him a special perspective on the business.

“I appreciate what everybody here does for this company because I’ve done it all – I really understand the challenges everyone here deals with,” he said. “It’s because of my experience, doing so many different things here, that I feel I know how to make things work and find solutions when we are confronted with problems.”

That’s not to say he is above advice. Peykar is the son of Paul, who co-founded the business with his brothers Alex and Steven. Under the new executive structure, Paul serves as chairman emeritus, Alex as chairman and Steven as CEO.

“This is a family operation, and there is no ego amongst us,” he stressed. “My father and my uncles created that kind of [environment](https://www.hfndigital.com/tag/environment/ "Posts tagged with Environment"). I’m just the first of the second generation to move up.”

Peykar has two cousins, also second generation, who work with him: Jonny Peykar, vp of hospitality, who joined 10 years ago; and Eric Peykar, e-commerce sales manager, who has been with Nourison since 2016.

“Our relationship is the same as the one between my dad and his brothers,” he continued. “They come to me with questions sometimes, and I come to them with questions other times. We make decisions together.”

Peykar continued: “My goal is to stay the course and keep this boat upright and moving forward. Our core is strong, and I’m going to work to keep up that momentum. I’m here to be a good sounding board for our managers. I don’t need to execute, I need to encourage our people to execute.”
