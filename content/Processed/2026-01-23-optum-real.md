## A healthcare payment system that works better for everyone

Healthcare claim processing is complex, time-consuming and often frustrating. Payers and providers must navigate legacy technology, complex rules and unclear regulations, and a lack of effective interoperability between payer and provider systems. These challenges lead to significant inefficiencies like unnecessary denials, lack of transparency, untimely delays and abrasion between payers, providers and patients.

Both payers and providers end up spending unnecessary time and money on administrative tasks and rework instead of focusing on patients and their care. Powered by AI and automation, Optum Real is facilitating real-time interoperability between payers and providers to help make the health system work better for everyone.

[synth music plays throughout]

*[Words that are being uttered by the narrator appear on a white background, with black and beige animated dots moving along curved lines.]*

**On-screen text: Claims. Slow. Confusing. Costly. Fragmented systems. Manual workflows. Unclear processes.**

NARRATOR: The claims process is one of the most broken parts of healthcare: slow, confusing, and costly for everyone. Patients, providers, and payers alike are impacted by fragmented systems, manual workflows, and unclear processes.

*[Light blue dots appear on the white background and the words that are uttered appear over them.]*

**On-screen text: To help people live healthier lives and make the health system work better for everyone.**

NARRATOR: At UnitedHealth Group, our mission is to help people live healthier lives and make the health system work better for everyone.

*[The background goes back to white and orange and light blue “O”s of different shapes and sizes appear around words in the middle of the screen.]*

**On-screen text: Optum Real. Any payer any provider connect in real-time.**

NARRATOR: Today, Optum Real is bringing that mission to life—delivering the next generation of claims processing.

Optum Real is the engine that allows any payer and any provider to connect in real-time.

*[Words appear in the middle of the screen as “O”s stack on two columns to each side of them. The columns then connect to the center, before transitioning to encircle the words in the middle of the screen.]*

**On-screen text: Two-sided network. Before a claim is ever created.**

NARRATOR: It’s a two-sided network that takes the guesswork out of healthcare by providing answers before a claim is ever created.

*[The “O”s create 3 animated circles around the words in the middle of the screen. Then “O”s of different sizes fill the screen, before parting upwards and downwards.]*

**On-screen text: Digitize eligibility, claims and payment data. Real-time. Accessible. Actionable.**

NARRATOR: With Optum Real, payers can digitize their eligibility, claims and payment data, often locked in contracts, benefits and guidelines – making them real-time, accessible and actionable.

*[On the white background, “O”s of different sizes sit around the words in the middle of the screen.]*

**On-screen text: Direct access.**

NARRATOR: Providers can directly access this data without ever leaving their EMRs.

*[The scene transitions to the screen of a laptop with patient’s claim cards that open and expand as the narrator speaks. To the left of the screen a line with 4 dots connects 4 bullet points, that highlight at each step described.]*

**On-screen text: Pre-service. Visit. Review. Checkout.**

NARRATOR: Let’s take a closer look.

When a patient visits a provider, Optum Real instantly connects to the patient’s payer, verifying eligibility and coverage.

During the visit, Ambient AI records and scribes notes, helping providers spend less time on paperwork and more time on care.

The system scans the notes in real time, flagging errors or missing details so issues can be fixed immediately. In the past, small mistakes could cause a claim to be denied weeks later, but with Optum Real, the system helps address the issue before it becomes a problem.

At check out, Optum Real confirms the patient’s coverage and benefits – before the patient leaves the office.

*[The scene transitions to a white background with a big, light blue dot in the middle, on top of which a quote appears. Then, the quote slides to the left and more words appear inside orange and light blue dots.]*

**On-screen text: “It has been incredibly rewarding to see denials prevented before they even occur. David Ingham, DO, Chief Information Officer of Allina Health. >5K visits processed. LOWER denial rate for visits successfully run through Optum Real.**

NARRATOR: It’s already working. At Allina Health, we’ve seen fewer administrative errors and improved patient experience in just a few months - real impact for care teams, for patients, and for the system.

*[The scene slides to the left, with the orange and light blue dots disappearing as words appear on the white background.]*

**On-screen text: Streamlining reimbursement. Supporting efficient payment cycles. Reducing administrative overhead.**

NARRATOR: Optum Real is the foundation for a smarter, more connected health system - streamlining reimbursement, supporting efficient payment cycles, and reducing administrative overhead.

*[The words disappear and the scene transitions back to the animated dots moving along curved lines, with words appearing inside them. Then, the lines straighten and move to the top and bottom of the words that appear in the middle of the screen. Then the dots become “O”s.]*

**On-screen text: Payers. Providers. Faster decisions. Greater satisfaction. Optum Real.**

NARRATOR: By connecting payers and providers in real-time, we enable faster decisions and greater satisfaction.

It’s our mission, made real. Together, we’re building a health system that works better for everyone.

*[On a white background, the orange “O” of the Optum logo shrinks in the middle of the screen, then moves left to form the “Optum” logo.]*

**On-screen text: Optum.**
