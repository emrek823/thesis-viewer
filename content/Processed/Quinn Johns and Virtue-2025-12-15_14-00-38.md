### Product Strategy & 2026 Vision

- Core 2026 goal: dominate clinical-stage biotech manufacturing intelligence
	- Replace SharePoint-based batch review with ETRI platform
	- Position as go-to solution for Chief Technical Operations Officers
	- Target innovative clinical biopharma companies working with CDMOs
- CDMO angle: build agentic infrastructure on top of legacy systems
	- Enable AI applications over existing systems of record
	- Position ETRI team as infrastructure builders
- Success metric: proven foundation enables expansion to larger pharma and commercial manufacturing

### Market Thesis & Earned Insights

- Core thesis: decentralized manufacturing becoming increasingly specialized
	- Historical: single company could handle full drug manufacturing
	- Current trend: fragmented constellation of specialized partners
	- Drug complexity driving supplier/manufacturer specialization
- Manufacturing fragmentation examples:
	- Drug substance vs drug product split (API synthesis + formulation)
	- Biologics: protein manufacturing + vial filling by different companies
- Platform vision: navigate entire manufacturing constellation from laptop
	- Process recommendations and parameters
	- CDMO partner matching (marketplace dynamic)
	- Tech transfer and scale-up control

### Product Architecture Considerations

- Platform vs applications framework: jobs-to-be-done approach
- Key question: synergistic platform vs independent business lines
- Product categories assessed:
- Clean break between process optimization and post-manufacturing tools
- Focus on documented operation-by-operation results in paper records

### Team & Conference Updates

- Recent hires (Sam and Zach) performing well in Nomad office
- Strong ownership mentality and self-starter approach
- Domain expertise building priority:
	- Sam: drug discovery background, learning bio-process manufacturing
	- Zach: fintech background, learning clinical trial fundamentals
- Conference success: AI in drug development panel exceeded expectations
	- Strengthened consulting agency partnership
	- Generated high-quality leads across biotech and CDMO segments

### Next Steps

- January 8th follow-up call (pre-JPM)
- Quinn to send pre-read memo with formalized thoughts
- Skip JPM attendance (not ROI-positive at current stage)
