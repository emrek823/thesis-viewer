### Virtue Announces $55.75M Fund II to Continue Backing Pre-Seed and Seed-Stage Healthcare Founders

Fund I’s 100% Series A graduation rate and $1B portfolio valuation pave the way for Virtue’s next chapter of growth

[City, State], [Date] – Virtue was founded in 2021 to back healthcare founders - from seasoned healthcare operators to first-time technical founders - tackling previously intractable problems in healthcare in creative ways. 21 portfolio companies later, Virtue is announcing a $55.75M fund II to double-down on their healthcare sector and pre-seed/seed stage focus,

In just three years, Virtue’s Fund I portfolio companies – such as SmarterDx, Evvy, Mural Health, Anna Health, among others – have collectively raised over $225 million, reaching a combined valuation of over $1 billion. Virtue portfolio companies have a 100% Series A graduation rate - far exceeding the market average of 20% in healthcare VC.

Fund II, at $55.75 million was oversubscribed at more than twice the original target, underscoring investors’ confidence in Virtue’s proven track record of identifying and supporting visionary healthcare founders at the formation stage.Sean Doolan, Founder and Managing Partner of Virtue, emphasizes the need to combine deep domain expertise, a founder-first investment philosophy, and a disciplined focus on opportunities poised to enhance the entire healthcare value chain.

“We partner with founders in their earliest financing rounds to tackle the real, intractable problems that continue to hinder the broader healthcare system" said Sean Doolan, Founder and Managing Partner of Virtue. "By leveraging technology, creative ingenuity, and relentless determination, these founders can solve challenges where others have failed. We are honored to have the unwavering support of our best-in-class Limited Partners, allowing us to deepen our commitment to the next generation of healthcare innovators.”

Fund II follows the stellar performance of Virtue’s inaugural fund, which has achieved a 100% Series A graduation rate — far exceeding the market average of roughly 20% in healthcare between 2021 and 2024These results underscore the power of Virtue’s domain-focused, stage-specific approach and the firm’s reputation as a premier partner for early-stage healthcare founders.

Virtue’s stage and sector specialization allows the team to support startups spanning a range of customer types (provider, payer, life sciences, employer, D2C, etc) and product approaches (AI-enabled services, data products, engineering tools, compound software) that are key to reshaping how healthcare is delivered and financed.

“We are at a pivotal moment in healthcare, fueled by the convergence of rapid AI breakthroughs, shifting policies and regulatory landscape, pressure to modernize antiquated operating systems and unlock valuable clinical data assets, and an evolving cultural sentiment that demands more from the healthcare system. These forces — combined with ongoing shifts within the venture market — are creating unprecedented opportunities for company formation at the earliest stages, making this the most exciting corner of the healthcare sector today,” said Emre Karatas, Partner at Virtue.

Team Expansion

Alongside the launch of Fund II, Virtue welcomes two new team members whose expertise strengthens our capacity to champion early-stage healthcare innovators. Kunaal Patel joins with a proven track record in clinical AI/ML and data-focused operating roles, having previously served as a data scientist at Tempus AI, Valo Therapeutics and Cigna. Dave Singer brings over two decades of venture capital operational experience, having previously served as CFO at industry-leading firms such as Emergence Capital and Foundation Capital. Together, they expand our capabilities to deliver top-tier support for the next wave of transformative healthcare companies. Patel and Singer join Sean Doolan (Founder & Managing Partner), Emre Karatas (Partner), and the broader Virtue advisor team, further enhancing the firm’s capacity to support more founders who intend on enhancing the overall value of our healthcare system.

Notes

While the US healthcare industry represents the largest sector within the largest economy in the world – with the most robust venture capital market in the world – there had not yet been a ‘go-to’ venture capital firm built that seeks to exclusively serve pre-seed and seed healthcare founders – Virtue was formed in late 2021 by Sean Doolan to fill this capital void. And, now with the successful close of our Fund II we aim to capitalize on our early momentum, fueled by  healthcare industry tailwinds in addition to an accelerated adoption curve of generative AI and advances across the modern data stack, in order to solidify our position as the marquee earliest stage healthcare venture firm.

“We root ourselves in an unwavering determination to partner with elite founders, in their earliest financing round, who are solving real, intractable problems that plague the broader healthcare delivery, financial and data ecosystem(s) – which undoubtedly handicaps the full productivity potential of our overall economy – through technology, creative ingenuity and an uncommon drive to succeed where others have failed,” said Sean Doolan, Founder & Managing Partner of Virtue. “We are humbled by the overwhelming support from our best-in-class Limited Partners who have given us the opportunity to better support the next generation of healthcare founders.”

Fund II builds on the success of Virtue’s inaugural fund, which boasts a 100% Series A graduation rate (compared to a ~20% market average in healthcare from 2021–2024), over $225 million collectively raised by its portfolio companies since Virtue’s initial investments, and a current total market capitalization of over $1 billion across Fund I within inception only three years ago.

As both stage and sector specialists, Virtue seeks to meaningfully expand the aperture of traditional healthcare investment as well as founder phenotype. Unlike traditional healthcare firms, Virtue invests beyond solely innovative care delivery models where >65% of Fund I investments have been in pure software builds, ranging from open-source data transformation platforms to pharma cold chain logistics surveillance to specialty drug utilization prediction and underwriting models. It is clear that healthcare founders today are armed with far greater technical capabilities than ever before so it is no surprise that the healthcare industry, albeit highly regulated, has quickly become the greatest adopter of AI-native technologies.

‘5D’ investment framework typically investing in companies that focus on data, dollars, and/or delivery — three core verticals in which Virtue believes deep domain expertise can drive meaningful differentiation. When these verticals are coupled with a tangible distribution advantage, founders are better positioned to build and scale truly defensible businesses.

More experienced healthcare founders (2nd/3rd generation)

Healthcare founders take have greater technical proficiency than ever before

Potential shift in balance of power → from healthcare domain expertise to technical ability.

Highly qualified founders, from other domains, leveraging their non-healthcare domain expertise to improve intersectional / adjacent healthcare opportunities (e.g. supply chain expertise → pharma cold chain logistics; complex operations background → PACE; insurance underwriting → specialty drug utilization underwriting for self-insured employers; dental claims adjudication and administration)

We are in a moment in time where entirely new healthcare company formation opportunities are being generated due to the combination of tailwinds in AI advances, an evolving regulatory landscape and new administration, continued pressures within the healthcare sector to modernize, and cultural sentiment, combined with flux in venture market dynamics we believe the early stage represents the most exciting corner of the healthcare market.

Intriguing moment in time:

1. Tech. The rising tide of AI adoption is widespread; momentum unlikely to slow down as we’ve passed tipping point.

Building off classical ML and neural nets to generative AI creates immense opportunity set of near-term application adoption in clinical and non-clinical AI use cases.

Healthcare quality in USA generally very good however costs, historically, have been sky high → we are seeing use of generative AI materially reduce / contain costs while maintaining an appropriately high quality of care standard.

2. Regulatory

New administration, new leadership across HHS and sub-agencies (FDA and CMS, namely). Furthermore, 6/7 of healthcare congressional committees hail from rural (e.g. red) states.

Healthcare is a regulatory driven industry – more intrigued by how expected efficiency improvements in spend, across federal and state governments, will affect new build/invest opportunities.

Currently not expecting wholesale changes to healthcare policy under new admin – more so on optimizing performance, reducing W/F/A and overall inefficient spend – which alone would be a game changer.

3. Healthcare

Utilization now largely rebounded post-Covid

GLP-1 demand through the roof – not ending anytime soon

A lot of productivity enhancements in near/med-term to be had; suspect there will be increasing bias towards human condition (vs trad healthcare) by end of decade.

4. VC Market

VC industry in current state of flux – growing recognition that smaller is beautiful – alpha seeking earliest stage strategies aided by sector / thematic focus are gaining favor.

Expect the next 2-3 years to be incredibly fruitful as a pre-seed & seed stage investor.

5. Cultural Sentiment

People want more for the healthcare dollar

People want healthcare CX akin to consumer industries; expects similar real-time, high NPS service from healthcare.

Themes:

Backing healthcare founders at the formation stage whose companies could not have been possible even 2-3 years ago.
