### Ryan’s Platform Overview and Strategy

- Business model evolution from transactional recruiting to embedded talent partner
- Focus narrowed specifically to seed and Series A companies
	- Build talent pool at seed stage
	- Support through Series B
	- Help build internal talent team then offboard
- Value proposition centered on founder time leverage
	- ~25% of founder time spent on recruiting instead of GTM or product
	- High leverage activity but 80-90% of work (getting candidates to table) is not high leverage for founders
	- Founders should focus on closing candidates and first conversations, not sourcing
- Talent bar calibration in competitive market
	- Show founders good, great, excellent candidate examples
	- Help maintain standards without sacrificing speed

### Platform Technical Capabilities

- LinkedIn scraping and automation
	- Co-founder built scraping system to import profiles
	- 1,316 AI engineers imported in ~5 minutes
	- Prebuilt filters for universities, experience, degrees
- Personal email database development
	- Professional emails easier than personal
	- Concurrent outbound email sequences (3-4 touchpoints) plus LinkedIn messaging
- Embedded recruiting team makes initial candidate quality decisions
- Platform functions as lightweight ATS with full communication visibility
- Weekly founder conversations to calibrate on candidate feedback
- ~200 profiles reviewed per week per role
- Top 10-20 profiles highlighted for founder custom outreach

### Candidate Quality Assessment Framework

- Primary indexing factors:
	- Speed of career progression (promoted in 2 years vs. 4 years at same company)
	- Undergraduate degree quality and advanced degrees
	- GitHub activity and personal projects
- Target candidate profile: 2-8 years experience, senior engineer level
- Range from fresh UC Berkeley grads with hardcore coding experience to senior talent at pre-IPO companies
- Steering founders away from superficial judgments (e.g., LinkedIn connection count as negative signal)
- Focus on functional business impact rather than years of experience
	- What does this person need to accomplish?
	- Backend architecture scaling vs. pipeline generation vs. deal closing

### Market Insights and Hiring Dynamics

- First-time founders unwilling to recruit senior talent due to culture fit concerns
- Second-time founders can attract both younger and senior talent
- Age dynamics: younger founders reluctant to manage older engineers
- Culture over compensation as primary factor
	- Can’t compete on cash against Anthropic/OpenAI
	- Must compete on impact and vision
- AI native engineer demand across all portfolio companies
	- Everyone asks for this but most can’t define what it means for their business
- Strategic timing considerations: hire now vs. wait 6 months for better traction to attract higher quality talent

### Pricing and Next Steps

- $45K for 6-month engagement
- Not suitable for single hires; ideal for 3-10 hires
- Series A-B typically 10-25 hires
- Custom pricing based on hiring velocity
- Ryan to send updated deck and options for potential partnership
- Immediate opportunity: Virtue portfolio company looking for founding engineer role
