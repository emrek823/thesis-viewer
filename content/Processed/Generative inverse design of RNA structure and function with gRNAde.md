## Abstract

The design of RNA molecules with bespoke three-dimensional structures and functions is a central goal in synthetic biology and biotechnology. However, progress has been limited by the challenges of designing complex tertiary interactions such as pseudoknots, as well as engineering novel catalytic functions--problems that have remained largely intractable for automated methods. Here we present and experimentally validate a high-throughput generative AI pipeline for inverse design of RNA structure and function. Central to the pipeline is gRNAde, an RNA language model conditioned on 3D backbone structures and sequence constraints. In a community-wide, blinded RNA design competition on the Eterna platform, the gRNAde pipeline designs complex pseudoknotted RNAs at high success rates matching that of human experts, significantly outperforming other physics- and AI-based automated algorithms. We further demonstrate gRNAdes capability to generatively design functional RNA polymerase ribozymes with up to 20% sequence divergence from the wild type, discovering highly active variants in a functional landscape previously inaccessible to rational design and directed evolution. gRNAde thus provides an experimentally validated, open-source platform for automated design of complex RNA structures, paving the way for fully programmable RNA catalysts and nanostructures.
