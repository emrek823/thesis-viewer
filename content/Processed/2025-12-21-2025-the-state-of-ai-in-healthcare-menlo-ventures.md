### **Healthcare is setting the pace for enterprise AI adoption.**

Long dismissed as a digital laggard that trailed years behind every major innovation wave, healthcare has flipped the script. The **$4.9 trillion** industry,[1](#b7170d33-f27e-4b1a-878e-06c150ab74d0) which represents **one-fifth** of the U.S. economy[2](#27ca0f6f-c00f-4b56-a927-0c3956f389aa) but accounts for only **12%** of software spend,[3](#92a5f070-c10a-4d39-b6ab-8b6a579343d3) is now deploying AI at more than twice the rate (**2.2x**) of the broader economy.

![Healthcare AI adoption](https://menlovc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/1-healthcare_ai_adoption-scaled.webp)

The transformation happened fast. In just two years, healthcare went from 3% adoption to becoming America’s AI powerhouse. Health systems are leading the charge at 27%, outpacing outpatient facilities (18%) and payers (14%).

According to Menlo Ventures’ research, **22%** of healthcare organizations have implemented domain-specific AI tools, a **7x** increase over 2024 and **10x** over 2023. Health systems lead with **27%** adoption, followed by outpatient providers at **18%** and payers at **14%**. Life sciences companies are earlier in their journey but moving quickly, developing proprietary models built on decades of internal data to accelerate drug development. By contrast, AI adoption across the broader economy lags behind. Fewer than one in 10 companies (**9%**) has implemented AI,[4](#c8c4b727-aa0a-4b75-b917-9eedc633d4ef) and most rely on general tools like enterprise ChatGPT instead of purpose-built solutions.

What’s driving the urgency? Industry conditions and market dynamics have made AI a strategic priority. For providers, administrative overhead continues to erode margins[5](#dede5be7-fb80-4acf-b003-55807d84150a) and burn out clinicians,[6](#b4c00165-58fa-4777-abb7-572459e5c2e2) compounding post-pandemic labor shortages. Payers face rising medical costs and constrained premium growth. Pharma and biotech struggle with stagnant productivity, long R&D timelines, and high costs. AI offers the potential for improved efficiency, economics, and outcomes.  
  
Organizations are already investing real dollars behind the promise. Healthcare AI spending hit **$1.4 billion** this year,[7](#a3956c32-e570-490b-aa5b-094033a1265d) nearly **tripling** 2024’s investment. To put that in perspective, our [2024 Enterprise AI report](https://menlovc.com/2024-the-state-of-generative-ai-in-the-enterprise/)[8](#bb78af81-fc63-4cdf-938f-05031e8f0f2e) estimated the *entire* vertical AI market, including sectors from law to design and breakout companies like [Harvey](https://www.harvey.ai/), [Eve](https://www.eve.legal/)\*, [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/), and [Higgsfield](https://higgsfield.ai/)\*, at just **$1.2 billion** last year. Across the enterprise landscape, only horizontal chatbots and coding assistants are expanding faster.

This surge of activity has produced **eight healthcare AI unicorns** and many more rising stars valued between **$500 million** and **$1 billion**—more than any other vertical AI segment, including legal, financial services, and media. In this early phase of rapid transformation, AI is defining the future of how healthcare operates.

![Healthcare AI unicorns](https://menlovc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2-healthcare_ai_unicorns-scaled.webp)

These companies represent the leading edge of a transformation that’s reshaping how healthcare organizations operate, interact with patients, and manage their financials.

This report draws on comprehensive surveys of **more than 700** healthcare executives across the United States, including senior leaders in insurance and benefits, executives in pharma and biotech, and technology decision-makers at healthcare provider organizations. It is further informed by conversations with dozens of additional industry stakeholders.[9](#7ceb7107-4d20-4e15-9738-c2c4ba08196a) The report offers a detailed look at healthcare’s AI transformation, exploring where organizations are advancing from pilots to production, which business models are converting services into software, and where the next wave of category leaders is poised to emerge across care delivery, health insurance, and drug development.

### **The AI Imperative: Move Fast and Place Big Bets**

Large-scale investment and adoption across leading players illustrates how dramatically the industry has transformed through AI in just the last 12 months:

* [Kaiser Permanente](http://kaiserpermanente.org)deployed [Abridge](https://www.abridge.com/)’s ambient documentation solution across **40** hospitals and **600+** medical offices, marking the largest generative AI rollout in healthcare history and Kaiser’s fastest implementation of a technology in over **20** years.
* [Advocate Health](https://www.advocatehealth.org/) evaluated over **225** AI solutions to select **40** use cases to go live with, including the largest deployment of [Microsoft Dragon Copilot](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/health-solutions/clinical-workflow/dragon-copilot), imaging tools like [Aidoc](https://www.aidoc.com/) and [Rad AI](https://www.radai.com/), and AI for its call centers. These initiatives are projected to reduce documentation time by **more than 50%**, while automating prior authorizations, referrals, and coding workflows.

* [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/) is investing **more than $1 billion** in AI over the next few years across more than **200** projects that go beyond administrative automation to include diagnostics and patient care.
* [SimonMed](https://www.simonmed.com/), one of the largest independent radiology groups in the U.S., has scaled its partnerships from co-building with **fewer than 10** vendors to piloting solutions from **more than 50**, including AI systems for intake, ambient scribing, and revenue cycle management.
* [Grow Therapy](https://growtherapy.com/), a leading digital mental health platform, is building an AI care companion that bridges in-session therapy with 24/7 support and pioneering continuous measurement through voice and language analysis to replace static assessment tools like PHQ-9 and GAD-7.

### **How Leading Healthcare Organizations Choose AI**

Healthcare’s approach to AI adoption differs markedly from past technology waves. Unlike the EHR era, which was driven by regulation, centralized decision-making, and long implementation cycles, healthcare buyers now embrace rapid experimentation across the organization, often starting with low-stakes pilots in administrative functions to build AI expertise and adoption muscle.

Organizations that move quickly through this phase are capturing advantages in cost structure, patient satisfaction, and clinical outcomes. Those that move slowly risk falling irreversibly behind.

Leading health organizations like Mayo Clinic, [Cleveland Clinic](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/), and Kaiser Permanente reflect this new approach. Working with AI partners, these systems prioritize:

1. **Maturity of technology.** Buyers prioritize production-ready solutions that perform reliably at scale. The goal is to deploy proven systems quickly, without heavy R&D or custom development.
2. **Level of risk to patient care.** Tools that don’t directly interface with patients get faster approval, while higher-risk applications that are exposed to patients face deeper scrutiny and longer timelines.
3. **Short-term value delivery.** Rapid ROI matters, but so does organizational confidence. Quick wins generate the momentum and credibility needed to drive sustained adoption.

By stacking early wins, they build operational muscle for long-term transformation.

Notably, cost is secondary in this framework. Organizations will pay a premium for trusted AI solutions in a space where the risks of failure (including operational disruption, patient harm, and reputational damage) are far greater.

### **AI Procurement Cycles: Providers Accelerate, Payers Deliberate**

The shift toward rapid experimentation is reshaping how healthcare organizations buy technology. Our survey data shows that procurement cycles are compressing dramatically for health systems and outpatient providers.

![Healthcare AI vs. non-AI procurement cycles](https://menlovc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/3-ai_procurement_cycles-scaled.webp)

**Health systems** have shortened average buying cycles from **8.0** months for traditional IT purchases to **6.6** months, an **18%** acceleration. **Outpatient providers** have moved even faster, reducing timelines from **6.0** months to **4.7** months, a **22%** improvement.

Not all sectors are moving at this pace. **Payers** have seen buying cycles lengthen from **9.4** months to **11.3** months, while **pharmaceutical and biotech** companies remain steady at around **10** months.

This divergence reflects fundamentally different approaches to AI adoption. Historically known for slow technology uptake (many startups refer to provider purchasing cycles as “death by pilot”), leading providers have now crossed a threshold as they buy production solutions and deploy quickly, while payers and biopharma remain “AI-curious,” still in piloting and experimentation mode.

### **Healthcare AI Spend: Where Money Actually Flows**

Dollars are following the pace of adoption. Providers dominate AI adoption in healthcare, especially health systems—supplying **$1 billion** of the **$1.4 billion** now flowing into healthcare AI, or **75%** of the total. Outpatient providers represent **$280 million** (**20%**), while payers contribute just **$50 million** (**5%**), and bio & life sciences less than that.

![Healthcare AI spend by buyer](https://menlovc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/4-ai_spend_by_buyer-scaled.webp)

Health systems are leading in AI because the level of need is highest and the ROI is obvious: thin margins, high staffing ratios and administrative costs, and staff shortages at all levels. AI agents offer the promise of improving efficiency and margins without compromising care quality.

Two categories that address acute operational pain points and deliver measurable ROI are ambient clinical documentation (**$600 million**), which reduces physician burnout, and coding and billing automation (**$450 million**), which recovers revenue lost to coding errors and denials.[10](#fccbd094-de4a-4faa-ba55-ff045310a2ad) Other fast-growing categories include patient engagement (**+20x** year over year) and prior authorization (**+10x** year over year).

![Healthcare AI spend by category](https://menlovc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/5-ai_spend_by_category-scaled.webp)

### **Startups Capture 85% of Spending**

Our survey reveals that **85%** of all generative AI spend in healthcare currently flows to startups rather than incumbents. Even in spaces like ambient scribing where Microsoft’s [Nuance](https://www.nuance.com/index.html) had deployed DAX medical speech recognition solutions to **77%** of U.S. hospitals,[11](#3994a85c-8285-4f38-ac58-acf287e1c63a) startups like Abridge and [Ambience](https://www.ambiencehealthcare.com/) have captured nearly **70%** of the new market with superior performance.

Startups have some advantages: They can move faster and design products natively around AI capabilities, unburdened by legacy technical debt and the bureaucracy of larger organizations. Incumbents’ new AI offerings have largely been bolt-on features to legacy platforms. As a result, AI-native challengers have gained rapid adoption and market share.

For healthcare IT giants like [Epic](https://www.epic.com/), [Oracle Health](https://www.oracle.com/health/), [athenahealth](https://www.athenahealth.com/), and [Change Healthcare](https://business.optum.com/en/?src=chc), this marks a period of real disruption risk. Many AI-native solutions are starting with a single wedge like medical scribing and expanding to take on more capabilities to ultimately disintermediate incumbents over time. However, Epic and other incumbents are now reacting, leveraging their massive advantages in distribution, integration, and scale.

### **Funding AI: From Reallocating IT Spend to Unlocking $740 Billion of Services Dollars**

Healthcare IT spend has historically been both limited and concentrated relative to the industry’s massive scale. Our data reveals that total U.S. healthcare administration spending reaches **$740 billion** annually, yet healthcare IT represents just **$63 billion** of that spend.[12](#5de79b07-5874-4b6d-86e3-3e5819aff09a) Manual labor and human services still dominate healthcare and contribute to its high cost.

The market is concentrated: Epic built the dominant system of record for medical documentation. [R1 RCM](https://www.r1rcm.com/), [Waystar](https://www.waystar.com/), and [SSI](https://thessigroup.com/) captured the back-office revenue cycle, selling software to streamline coding and billing. Together, medical documentation and back-office revenue cycle management (RCM) represent nearly **60%** of all healthcare IT spending, a combined market of roughly **$38 billion**.

Within these dollar flows, AI is finding budget along two distinct paths. Many of AI’s first winners have found success selling into existing IT budgets with solutions that augment existing IT systems with intelligent modules. But t
