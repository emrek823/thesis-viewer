## Slide 4: TECHNOLOGY BACKBONE

**RemedyLogic**

### Artificial intelligence for precise:

*   **MRI interpretation**
*   **Diagnosis determination**
*   **Treatment selection**

**Inputs:** raw spine MRI images, clinical symptoms, prior treatments, and comorbidities.
**Outputs:** MRI interpretation, diagnosis, likelihood of success/failure/complications for each treatment option

## Slide 5: WHY WE BUILT IT

**RemedyLogic**

### $200B / year is wasted due to human-caused mistreatment in MSK* in the U.S.

**Circle 1:**
50% of MSK* treatments are medically unnecessary

**Circle 2:**
$200 billion/year is wasted

**Underlying Causes:**
*   Faulty MRI Interpretation
*   Wrong Diagnosis
*   Incorrect Treatment

(*) Musculoskeletal - refers to spine, knees, hips, shoulders, and other bones, muscles, tendons, ligaments, and joints.
