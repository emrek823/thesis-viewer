### Eldarragi Background & Motivation

- Currently at Terray Therapeutics (largest company he’s worked at)
- Previous experience: Split Pass (inception to seed attempt), Albert Event (formulation/material science platform)
- Chemical engineering background + software experience
	- Can discuss CSTRs and batch processes with chemical engineers
	- Can handle SOC2 compliance and IT discussions
- Louisiana native, friend worked in gene therapy manufacturing for years
- Excited about early-stage work, building infrastructure from ground up
- Wants exposure to manufacturing vs discovery side
	- Feels discovery requires 20+ years biology experience for strategic input
	- Sees more opportunity to contribute meaningfully in manufacturing

### Virtue VC Investment Thesis

- $30M Fund 1 (24 investments), $55M Fund 2 just closed
- 100% Series A graduation rate vs 15-20% market average
- Focus: Pharma tech/IT, not pure therapeutics due to fund size constraints
- Geographic focus: NYC #1, SF, Boston
- Investment size: $1-3M pre-seed to allow experimentation phase

### Etri Opportunity Assessment

- Met Quinn summer 2023 through Datavant connections
- Quinn iterated through multiple ideas before landing on biomanufacturing
- Founder-market fit: Quinn speaks same language as process engineers/biomanufacturing VPs
- Market timing: First mover advantage in biomanufacturing software with AI capabilities

### Competitive Landscape Analysis

- Current systems: Old MES systems, electronic batch records from 80s/90s
- Incumbents (Viva, Master Control) lack modern code bases and AI talent
- Benchling/Ganymede serve different markets (research vs manufacturing)
- Key differentiator: Integration layer connecting disparate systems (LIMS, ELN, quality systems)
- Cross-institutional data flow creates defensible moat

### Technical Challenges Discussed

- API integration complexity across different CDMO systems
- Generalization beyond first design partner (gene therapies to biologics/small molecules)
- Risk of incumbents building competing solutions
- Need to prove value beyond basic automation before competitors catch up

### Next Steps for Seed Round

- Timeline: Quinn could raise beginning of next year with 1-2 more hires
- Requirements for larger rounds:
	- Land and expand on product platform
	- Close first major CDMO (Lonza, Catalent level)
- Network effects: One CDMO works with ~30 sponsors, creating scaling opportunity
- Emre confident about fundraising prospects given market feedback
