Intuitive Surgical Inc (NASDAQ:ISRG) reported a strong third quarter with 18% growth in da Vinci procedures, driven by general surgery in the US and contributions from Japan, Germany, France, and the UK.

Intuitive Surgical Inc (NASDAQ:ISRG) has been successful in expanding its global reach, with a five-year compound annual growth rate of 21% in Europe and 25% in Asia for procedures.

The company has made significant advancements in digital tools, with nearly 3,000 da Vinci virtual reality simulators installed and over 14,000 active surgeon users of the My Intuitive app.

Intuitive Surgical Inc (NASDAQ:ISRG) faces ongoing capital pressure in Europe and China, impacting system placements due to government budget constraints and domestic competition.

The company is experiencing mixed market conditions in Asia, with procedure growth in South Korea below historical trends due to ongoing physician strikes.

The Ion platform, while showing strong growth, is still in the early stages of adoption outside the US, with initial placements just beginning in Europe and China.

Intuitive Surgical Inc (NASDAQ:ISRG) is facing challenges in the Chinese market due to domestic robotic competition and provincial preferences for local competitors.

Q: What are the expectations for margin progression with new products like da Vinci 5 and the mix evolving?A: Jamie Samath stated that while they aim for top-tier margins, they do not expect operating margins above 40%.

Gary Guthart added that they do not expect significant changes in forecast models due to dual console availability.

Q: How is the capital environment, particularly in Europe and China, affecting hospital budgets and capital spending?A: Jamie Samath described the US capital environment as stable, while Europe faces pressure due to government budget constraints.
