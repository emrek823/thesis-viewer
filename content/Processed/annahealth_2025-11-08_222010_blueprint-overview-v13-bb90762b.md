# ANNA Overview

# My Story

CenterPointe

Aimun Malik
Co-Founder and CEO

Family History
I grew up around healthcare. My parents were both immigrants, my
mom a resident who carried me around the hospital and my dad
drove a taxi to pay for college. They started CenterPointe-a
behavioral health hospital system they owned and operated for
25 years before selling to Acadia in 2021.

My brother started telebehavioral health company with 1DocWay
before selling to Genoa, which was acquired by Advent. He served
on the board through the Optum acquisition, where he ran the
telebehavioral business for several years before launching his
second company focused on Serious Mental Illness.

My Journey
After starting my career in M&A, private equity, and venture capital, I
joined Triple Aim Partners - a company creation platform.

As a GM of NewCo creation, I worked on four companies
collectively worth $1.5 billion: two capitated primary care MSOs
(Oasis in the Medicare Advantage space and Diverge in the Managed
Medicaid space) and two multi-site behavioral companies (Guidelight
in the IOP space and Steadfast in the MAT space)

# The Triple Aim Lessons

Remarkable De Novo Economics
Companies built with an average investment of
$5 million transacted for over $1 billion each.
This was exemplified by the successful exits of
Prospero and ArchWell, both sold for over $1
billion.

Compounding Value via Playbooks
Institutionalized playbooks across portfolio
companies for key functions like market selection,
payor development, and recruiting ensured each
successive company became more valuable
than the last.

# ANNA-NDBI Centers of Excellence
ANNA was founded on the insight that traditional Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) was ineffective and even harmful to young
children, and a novel model of clinical interventions, Naturalistic Developmental Behavioral Interventions (NDBI), was the most
evidence-based model of care. NDBI was a wedge by which we could create tech-enabled centers of excellence.

Challenges in Traditional ABA : Discrete Trial Training
- Rote Learning Focus
Limits generalization of skills, making them hard to apply in real life.
- External Reinforcement
Can lead to over-reliance on rewards and diminish intrinsic motivation.
- Discrete, Adult-Led Instruction
Less natural and can hinder spontaneous social engagement and interaction.
- Rigid Structure
Increases anxiety or resistance, especially for young children with autism.
- Limited Family Involvement
Parents are less empowered and involved in their child's therapeutic progress.
- Fragmented Care
Difficulty in coordinating multiple therapies, leading to disjointed treatment.

ANNA Care Model: Naturalistic Developmental Behavioral Interventions
- Natural Context Learning
Emphasizes learning in natural contexts, ensuring skills transfer to real-life situations.
- Intrinsic Motivation
Emphasizes child-initiated activities, fostering deeper learning and self-drive.
- Play-Based & Social Interaction
Incorporates natural contingencies and developmental principles for better social
engagement.
- Flexible, Play-Based Routines
Reduces stress and is more suitable for young children, encouraging participation.
- Active Parent Partnership
Involves parents as active partners, enhancing consistency and improving outcomes.
- Integrated Care
Fosters collaboration between behavioral, speech, and occupational therapies for holistic
support.

# ANNA's Launch
ANNA opened our first location in Sudbury, Massachusetts in February 2024 with a novel hypothesis: Naturalistic Developmental Behavioral
Interventions (NDBI) represented both superior clinical care for autistic children and a model actively sought by referral sources and families.
The response was immediate.

# ANNA's Four Core Advantages
Clinical Excellence
Repeatable, scalable approach to delivering high-quality NDBI
services that outperform traditional ABA across all major
developmental domains in Vineland Adaptive Behavior Score.

Talent Recruitment
Repeatable, scalable methodologies to recruit and develop clinical
talent with 2.7% BT acceptance rate and 10.5% BCBA acceptance
rate

Family Attraction
Repeatable, scalable, and profitable channels of attracting families
through superior outcomes and brand-led flywheel

Economic Efficiency
Consistently strong and improving unit economics with 10x cash
flow / investment economics for exponential organic growth.

The core advantage arises from the compounding benefit of layering each function upon the other. Superior clinical outcomes attract both
the best talent and families, which drives word-of-mouth growth, which enables favorable payor contracting at 20-40% above rack
rates.

# Massachusetts Market Strategy
Our real estate approach in Greater Boston consists of identifying 7
core markets that make up the region: Middlesex, Central, North Shore
Inside 95, South Shore Inside 95, North Shore, South Shore, and
Worcester County-opening locations in each.

- 8 Locations Secured
4 open locations, 1 in construction,
and 3 LOls signed

- $40mm PE ARR
Across just these 8 locations

- $16mm PF Contribution Profit
Making Massachusetts highly profitable
after deducting ~$4M corporate
expense

Key Insight: Each sub-market can support more than 1 fully-ramped
center. At 3 centers per sub-market, this represents a $105 million top-
line opportunity in Greater Boston alone-before considering
Springfield and other large metros in Massachusetts.

# Market Entry Framework

provide individualized nutrition plans. Al trains clinicians in FBT protocols, reinforces fidelity, and equips parents with adaptive coaching. Addresses
surge in adolescent eating disorder demand post-pandemic in $10B+ market.

# Pediatric Mental Health: Deep Dive
Individuals with autism are 25x more likely to make a suicide attempt than non-autistic adults. This critical adjacency to autism
care is important not only for more effective autism services but also for more effective delivery of pediatric behavioral health
overall for the 1 in 5 children with mental health conditions.

The superior clinical model combines Parent-Management Training (PMT), actively engaging parents in clinical service delivery,
with Modular Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (MCBT), a more flexible application of CBT to better fit individual needs of children and
adolescents.

improves go-to-market efficiency as patients engage in multiple services across the continuum over time.

# The Blueprint Opportunity
$2.5 Trillion Healthcare Services Market
Al has unlocked an entirely new frontier within healthcare services, creating an opportunity to transform care delivery via the
repeatable creation of category-defining healthcare businesses. The opportunity for Blueprint Health compounds the
remarkable de novo economics we've already proven at ANNA and sets a foundational opportunity to leverage core
infrastructure to build a generational company creation engine.

This transformation begins with the clinical model itself. Al has enabled the transformation of clinical care delivery to be
aligned with the highest quality, evidence-based practice at scale via tools like AI LMS, Al clinical fidelity, and Al wraparound
clinical care delivery plugging the gaps between care.

The opportunity is not just to build a category-defining business, but to build a business
that redefines the category of healthcare services.

# Appendix

# Why Vertical Integration Wins
The far and away most common path for companies embracing Al today is to build the application layer on top of foundational models
rather than vertically integrate into owning the economics of the end customer. While this will create valuable businesses, three key
insights make vertical integration more compelling:

Last-Mile Problem
Within healthcare, Al at the
application layer struggles from a
last-mile problem. Healthcare
companies are too idiosyncratic in
their workflows and technology
stacks for pure horizontal
applications. We couldn't purchase an
Al treatment plan automation tool off-
the-shelf because our clinical model
is unique and our EMR is customized.

Limited Pricing Power
Pricing power for Al applications is
generally limited. With the cost of
development collapsing due to
increasingly effective Al tooling, the
replacement cost of insourcing a
previously outsourced Al application
is substantially lower. Traditional
software relied on economies of scale
and high replacement costs to justify
pricing.

Value Capture
The profit pools have expanded so
drastically that the point of leverage is
in the residual owner of that profit
pool rather than the tooling that
enables its creation. Al applications
create exceptional value, but the
dollar amount largely accrues to the
customer.

# De Novo vs. Acquisition Economics
An M&A playbook leveraging Al can acquire a 20% margin asset at 7.5x, double top-line and double margin to 40% to flip for a
4x return. But the real value creation occurs when rather than buy at 7.5x, you can build at 0.1x for a 300x return.

| Acquisition Economics | Pre-Al | Post-Al |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Single-Unit Revenue | $5,000,000 | $10,000,000 |
| Single-Unit EBITDA Margin | 20.0% | 40.0% |
| Single-Unit EBITDA | $1,000,000 | $4,000,000 |
| (x) Enterprise Value / EBITDA Multiple | 7.5x | 7.5x |
| Purchase / Sale Price | $7,500,000 | $30,000,000 |
| (/) Purchase Price | $7,500,000 | $7,500,000 |
| Return on Invested Capital | 1.0x | 4.0x |

| De Novo Economics | Pre-Al | Post-Al |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Single Unit Investment to Breakeven | $100,000 | $100,000 |
| Single-Unit Revenue | 5,000,000 | 10,000,000 |
| Single-Unit EBITDA Margin | 20.0% | 40.0% |
| Single-Unit EBITDA | $1,000,000 | $4,000,000 |
| (x) Enterprise Value / EBITDA Multiple | 7.5x | 7.5x |
| Enterprise Value | $7,500,000 | $30,000,000 |
| (/) Single Unit Investment to Breakeven | $100,000 | $100,000 |
| Return on Invested Capital | 75.0x | 300.0x |

The acquisition multiples are expanding to fair market value as the market recognizes Al transformation potential. The
arbitrage window is closing for M&A, but wide open for de novo creation.

# Blueprint Corporate Structure
The Blueprint structure involves converting ANNA into a wholly-owned subsidiary of a HoldCo, Blueprint, and centralizing corporate staffing and infrastructure
to build new category defining companies as subsidiaries of the HoldCo initially financed off balance sheet capital and HoldCo capital structure and then
financing externally as required. This process beings with nearest adjacency of pediatric behavioral health and expands beyond specialties as competency
surface area expands.
