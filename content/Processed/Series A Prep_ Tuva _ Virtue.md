### Series A Fundraising Strategy

- Target raise: $12M (floor $10M, prepared to discuss up to $15M+ for right conversations)
- Standard Series A dilution: 20% (could be as low as 15% with multiple term sheets)
- Target post-money valuation: ~$60M at 20% dilution
- Term sheet timing: Usually 4-5 days to respond, but flexible with strong interest
- Outreach timeline: Starting in next 24-48 hours
- Aaron to provide outreach blurb today

### Pitch Deck Review & Improvements

- Slides 2-3 need strengthening: Focus on clear problem statement and “why now”
- Slide 8 (ACVs): Updated to show ranges
	- Enterprise Platform: $500K-5M+
	- MDM: $150K-500K
- Slide 9 (TAM): Needs simplification to show:
	- Current market serving (PBC, digital health)
	- Larger addressable market with arrow showing expansion
	- Focus on message “we serve everyone”
- Slide 12: Needs strengthening to emphasize:
	- Open source advantages
	- PLG (Product Led Growth)
	- Low/No CAC acquisition
	- Bottom-up contributor strategy

### Next Steps
