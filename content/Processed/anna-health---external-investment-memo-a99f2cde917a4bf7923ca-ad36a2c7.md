## Executive summary

Anna is building tech-enabled clinics to provide comprehensive, value-based care for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) by scaling access to Naturalistic Developmental Behavioral Interventions (NDBIs), the latest and most effective clinically validated approach to ASD care.

Prevalence of ASD has more than tripled over the last 20 years (2.1M children in US today), with 18,000 clinics required to meet this demand but only ~1,600 autism treatment clinics in the US today (<10% of supply). PE has invested billions of dollars over the last decade chasing rich reimbursement in the space, but much of this investment has been in the buyout of existing providers (rather than increasing access to services), and the rapid growth of these platforms has harmed patient outcomes and caused provider burnout.

Anna addresses the failures and leverages lessons learned from previous players by focusing on NDBI interventions, technology integration, value-based care, and empowering the highest quality clinicians (e.g., BCBAs, RBTs, Speech/Occupational Therapists). This approach gives Anna the opportunity to drive margin on quality outcomes and reinvest back into care and capital efficient growth. Anna is the prototypical example of what we look for in a venture-scalable care delivery model - scaling access to a clinically validated model (NDBI), efficient patient acquisition (early referral partners; 3-year patient LTV), high reimbursement per patient ($50-$100K per year), potential for ~50% clinic-level EBITDA, and clear attribution of value (comprehensive approach enables bundles for all services).

Anna has strong momentum prior to funding, a characteristic we see in the most successful companies in our portfolio. The company has already hired his core clinical team, identified its first location in Sudbury MA, identified initial referral streams, and has a GTM playbook for additional clinics in MA and beyond. By enrolling an average daily census (ADC) of 60 children, one clinic ($150k annual lease) has a payback period of 8 months and can generate enough cash flow at maturity (~12 months) to fund 8 other additional clinics to profitability.

We have been tracking Aimun, who has experience with 5+ VBC care delivery businesses from his time at Triple Aim, as he iterated on the company over the last year. We were quick to lead this round when we saw key milestones for the business (securing the first clinic, payer contracting, clinician hiring) completed ahead of schedule. With Virtue's model and fund size, we are aligned with his vision to scale this business to a $300M - $600M exit (5-10x EBITDA) without large equity raises, giving us the potential to return the fund.

We are excited to lead Anna's $1.5M pre-seed with a $750K check at a $7.5M cap to 1) to build out its first clinic and reach break-even, 2) begin expansion with MA with additional clinics, and 3) generate initial outcomes required to enter bundles with payers.

## Team

Aimun has iterated over the last year to identify the clinical, reimbursement and GTM model for Anna. Recent hires for clinical staff that are nationally-recognized experts in NDBI have only further validated his approach.

*   **Aimun Malik, CEO** - Aimun grew up in a family of behavioral health entrepreneurs and worked in healthcare investment banking and private equity before joining Triple Aim Partners (essentially the strategic incubation arm of $UHG). During his time at Triple Aim, Aimun worked on the launch of 5+ care delivery companies, with a strong focus on multi-site operations and value-based care. Virtue has been tracking Aimun over the last year as he ideated on the exact approach for Anna. We have been thoroughly impressed with his understanding of the autism market, ability to hire clinicians renowned in their field, and early momentum in Anna's first market in MA.

Her clinical and research interests are centered around early childhood, and early intervention for children at risk for behavioral, mental health, and educational challenges at school entry. Clinically, her work has focused on evidence-based interventions for children with emotional and behavioral disorders, Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS), and parent training. Her research has focused on parent-child factors and early environmental contexts as they relate to self-regulation in the service of academic and socioemotional components of school readiness.
*   **Yael Stern, PhD, Senior Clinical Advisor.** Yael received her PhD in Communication Sciences and Disorders from Northwestern University where she also completed the requirements for her clinical certification in speech-language pathology. Yael's training has focused on delivering and studying caregiver-mediated communication and language interventions for young children with autism spectrum disorder. She has experience in delivering in-person, home-based early intervention, as well as caregiver-mediated early intervention via telehealth. Yael's research focuses on how understanding family characteristics can improve the design and delivery of individualized, family-centered early interventions for children with autism spectrum disorder.

## Market Overview: Why now?

There has been a wave of private equity activity to fund autism treatment centers over the last 5-10 years in response to increasing ASD prevalence, supply/demand imbalance, and increased reimbursement coverage for these high-cost patients. Anna takes advantage of these same trends but is launching from day one with the latest clinically validated approach to care (NBDI), a focus on value-based care that gives the company the clinical flexibility and margin to hire the highest-quality clinicians, and a capital efficient approach for thoughtful scale that takes advantage of talent and clinic space left behind by PE platforms.

**Prevalence Continues to Increase.** In 2001, 1 in 150 children was diagnosed with ASD. Today, the CDC estimates that about 1 in 36 children are diagnosed with ASD (2M+ children in US). The increased prevalence is driven by earlier detection of ASD, better tools for screening and diagnosis, and increased awareness and reduction of stigma around ASD.

**Supply / Demand Imbalance:** There is an unmet demand of over 16,000 clinics to treat children with Autism, 10x the supply currently available. PE-backed clinics (CARD, Invo) are folding or rolling back operations after inefficient growth, further exacerbating these challenges in markets around the country.

**High Costs per Patient:** After a diagnosis of autism, children are in treatment for the rest of their childhood and often into well into adulthood, especially for those with additional intellectual disabilities. The average annual cost for an individual with ASD is $50K - $100K per year, with lifetime costs >$2m. Overall in the US, the costs for autism today are $200B, with another 2M cases to be identified over the next 10 years given similar increases in prevalence we've seen over the last 10 years.

**Backlash on PE-platforms:** There has been a lot of capital chasing rich reimbursement, with less regard for children and families. The majority of PE activity in the autism sector is in the buyout of existing providers, which does not necessarily lead to the expansion of services or opening of new sites. >75% of transaction volume has occurred since the start of 2016, primarily driven by strategic add-on acquisitions for companies founded in the 90's with no plans or clinical/business foundation for scale.

**Clinically Validated Models:** Traditional applied behavioral analysis (ABA) is still the most common intervention in the US today. In 2020, however, the American Psychological Association's *Psychological Bulletin* published a meta-analysis that showed NDBI approaches, which combine behavioral and developmental approaches, had stronger evidence to support effectiveness than behavioral approaches alone. Early positive outcomes from NDBI include enhanced social communication (increased use of gestures, joint attention, and language in natural contexts), generalization and flexibility (skills learned in therapy translate to real-life setting), and improved quality of life (enhances social relationships).

**Early-stages of VBC:** VBC for ASD treatment is in the early-stages, but over the last 2-3 year payers and providers have been working to define quality and outcome measures to enter VBC contracts. Companies like Cortica have entered bundled arrangement with payers for higher reimbursement rates than FFS, an important precedent that Anna can leverage. Anna can also help to measure, define, and scale access to quality measures that health plans need but lack today from their current provider networks.

## Anna Approach

Anna provides the integration of behavioral approaches and developmental approaches in the next generation of ABA therapy, Naturalistic Developmental Behavioral Interventions (NDBI). Anna leverages technology and focuses on value-based care to employ the highest quality clinicians, drive margin on outcomes, and reinvest into care - an important flywheel that drives long-term, compounding advantages.

**Clinical Model:** Anna's comprehensive clinical team (image below) treats patients in the Anna clinic for 30-40 hours per week, while other providers may focus on in-home or school-based care. A typical day for a patient include 3-3.5 hours with an RBT, and another hour each with the speech language pathologist (SLP) and occupational therapist (OT).

Anna's clinical model addresses the four key challenges that patients/families, providers, and payers are facing today.

| Current Challenges                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Anna Approach                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| **Delayed Care:** Typical autism diagnosis for children is delayed by multiple years. Pediatricians are not trained to diagnosis autism during a typical well-visit, developmental pediatrician wait times are 5+ months, and ABA clinic wait times are 5+ months.                                                                        | Anna has already identified and engaged multiple referral partners to reduce the time to care and eliminate waitlists. Its early focus is on early intervention programs (0-2 years old) that can refer into Anna after their patients age out. Over time as Anna reaches scale and has more capacity, Anna can expand to working with developmental pediatricians in a region to drive referral streams. These developmental pediatricians have ~20 new patients per month, 40% of which receive a diagnosis of ASD.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Fragmented approach:** There are a number of different stakeholders - teachers, speech language pathologists, pediatricians, occupational therapists, behavioral health therapists - involved in a child's care. These stakeholders are not coordinated nor incentivized to be coordinated today. | Anna provides coordinated diagnosis, NDBI therapy, speech language pathology, and occupational therapy within one clinic. This approach not only provides a better patient/caregiver experience, but provides an opportunity for VBC by bringing together all ancillary services under one roof.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Provider burnout:** Providers lack quality training, specialist access, ongoing supervision, and are typically regimented to strict schedules that force them to maximize FFS billing vs. patient care. Other scaled clinics (CARD, Blue Sprig, Elemy, etc) have poor provider experience, evidenced by many of their glassdoor reviews. | Anna has already hired clinicians that are leaders in the field of NDBI. Anna is able to attract these clinicians first and foremost because of its dedication to NDBI and high-quality care. Over time, Anna can also become a leader in NDBI space by training certified clinicians in these approaches to create its own supply and entering bundled arrangements with payers so providers aren't confined to the rigid structure of FFS reimbursement (discrete times and requirements for reimbursement). |
| **Lack of Quality Measures:** Providers are pushing for higher reimbursement rates but payers are struggling to define what quality care looks like. There are pockets of examples - BHCOE, Magellan, etc - but these have struggled to scale.                                                                                              | Anna can be a leader in the space today by simply measuring the current standard of quality and outcomes data. Longer-term, Anna can help create the new standard that payers are looking for to help with UM, provider networks, and FWA that they struggle with today.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

**Hiring High-Quality Clinicians:** Today, RBTs are only paid when delivering care, have very little visibility on their earnings, and lack training or technology to improve patient outcomes and make their jobs easier. Turnover in these roles can be very high, with turnover rates ranging from 45% to 75%. If Anna can focus on hiring, incentivizing, and retaining the highest-quality providers, it creates a flywheel (shown below) that can create long-term, competitive advantages. Great clinicians lead to improved outcomes, which leads to bundled rates with higher margins and more flexibility for providers, continuing the cycle.

*Anna Flywheel Diagram (Company Deck October-23)*
- **Higher Quality Incentive Payments** (center) leads to and from:
    - **Re-Investment into Care Team**
    - **Employer of Choice**
    - **Improved Outcomes**
    - **More Referrals and Direct Inbounds**
    - **Greater Patient Retention**
    - **Higher Margins**

The company has already shown it can attract providers from some of the top autism treatment centers and institutions in the country, providing early validation of the clinical approach and culture Anna wants to build. Anna wants to make boots on the ground providers the entire focus of the organization, flipping the model typically seen in care delivery. This strategy involves “little things", such as giving all providers equity in the business and positioning the corporate entity (even the CEO) as support staff versus leaders of the company, that Aimun saw success with in previous care delivery models he was involved with.

Over time, Anna wants to establish itself as a leader in NDBI practice and implementation where its brand attracts the best clinicians. It can begin to go directly to university and certification programs to create its own supply by offering NDBI training in university and certification programs (RBT training is typically 12 weeks). It can then provide a ramped clinic and program for these RBTs to enter to eventually graduate to becoming a BCBA, the ultimate goal for many RBTs.

## Clinical Evidence Overview

The field of "Applied Behavioral Analysis” (ABA) - the science of understanding how changes in the environment affect human behavior - laid the foundation for autism treatment today. NDBI is also a form of ABA, but differs from traditional ABA by combining effective teaching methods combining the science of ABA (**behavioral**) with the **developmental** methods known to enhance motivation, engagement and learning. NDBI has been proven to lead to better outcomes, but adoption is low today. The market is at an inflection point of adoption and Anna has the opportunity to become a leader in the space by training clinicians in NDBI, defining and measuring quality and outcomes for care, and helping clinicians navigate through the alphabet soup of approaches to focus on what matters - patients and families.

| Approach    | Traditional ABA                                                                                                                                                                   | Developmental Relationship-based Intervention (DRBI)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Naturalistic developmental behavioral intervention (NDBI)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| **Description** | Based on operant learning theory. Behavior is learned based on what happens before the behavior (antecedent) and what happens after it (reward). | In contrast to behavioral intervention, DRBI is a parent-mediated intervention where the primary focus is on training parents and other caregivers to build and use warm, meaningful interactions to help the child function better in communicating, learning, and problem solving. | In an effort to address some of the drawbacks of traditional ABA, NDBI incorporates more choices for children to gain their buy-in to the treatment. The learning is carried out in natural situations such as play or daily routines and involves parents, and the rewards given are related to the child's interest. |
| **Types of Interventions** | Discrete Trial Training (DTT), Intensive Behavioral Intervention (IBI)                                                                                                    | Developmental individual differences relationship-based approach (DIR/Floortime), Focused Playtime Intervention (FPI), Responsive Teaching (RT)                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Pivotal Response Treatment (PRT), Project ImPAct, Joint Attention Symbolic Play Emotion Regulation (JASPER), Early-start Denver Model (ESDM)                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

**Evolution:** In 2015, a consensus paper from *Schreibman et al* categorized several interventions as belonging under the NDBI umbrella - a 3rd type of approach beyond traditional ABA and DRBI (table above).

While the specific interventions are not new (see below), the field has been pushing over the last 8 years to drive additional outcomes through RCTs, bring together behavioral and developmental research and treatment in ASD, and disseminate these more flexible models to clinicians. Specific approaches include:

*   **Pivotal Response Treatment (1999):** Uses a child's natural motivations (toys, games and activities that a child wants and cares about) to teach and reinforce new, pro-social behaviors.
*   **Project ImPAct (Improving Parents as Communication Teachers (2015):** Parent-mediated intervention for young children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and related social communication delays.
*   **Joint Attention Symbolic Play Emotion Regulation (JASPER) (2006):** Aims to improve children's relationships with people (through joint attention and engagement) and interactions with objects (through development of play), while helping children maintain and modulate their affect and behavior (through regulation strategies).
*   **Early-start Denver Model (2010):** Focused on ages 1-5 with play-based joint activity routines and natural reinforcement (e.g., play) vs. artificial reinforcement (e.g., candy)

No matter the specific approach under the NDBI umbrella, common components of NDBI include (table 1): face-to-face on the child's level, following the child's lead, displaying positive affect and animation, modeling appropriate language, responding to attempts to communicate, and using communicative temptations.

**Outcomes:** A 2020 meta-analysis demonstrated that outcomes for NDBI were favorable for a broader range of outcomes than other approaches (behavioral or developmental alone). When considering randomized controlled trials (RCTs), the paper showed evidence of positive summary effects for developmental (DRBI) and NDBI intervention types when effect size estimation was limited to studies with randomized controlled trial (RCT) designs. Developmental interventions only, however, were limited to language and social communication outcomes. NDBI has an impact across a broader range of outcomes that patients and payers care about, including adaptive, cognitive, play, and restrictive behaviors.

**Implementation and understanding:** Despite the progress made over the last decade and evidence of outcomes through multiple RCTs, NDBIs are not implemented on a wide scale today. This is due to the differing theoretical orientations of behavioral and developmental sciences from which NDBI are derived, and a lack of training, knowledge, and support for implementing NDBIs within the behavior analytic community. In a survey of 901 respondents in 2022, only 21% of BCBAs and 12% of RBTs were familiar with the term NDBI. Even though the vast majority of respondents reported working on social communication goals with young children, less than half of respondents had received any formal training in relevant developmental sequences. NDBI interventions don't only have better outcomes in an academic or RCT setting, but are more flexible for individualized care, more feasible to implement in real-world with lower treatment intensity, and impact multiple domains that families care about.

## Competition

The majority of growth and investment in the space to-date has been for PE-backed platforms while VC-backed companies that offer tech only (Forta, Echo, Spectrum) or VC-backed clinics (Elemy, Cortica, Positive Development) have also come to market in recent years. Anna benefits from its fast-follower timing because of clinical validation of NDBI (e.g. Positive Development had to do a lot of legwork early on), ability to secure clinic space and talent from PE-backed players (e.g., CARD bankruptcy), and lessons learned for next-generation of VBC (e.g., piggybacking off of the Cortica model).

Below is a representative list of players in 3 buckets we considered for our competitive landscape - PE-backed platforms, technology players, and VC-backed providers.

| PE-backed Platforms                                                              | Tech        | VC-backed Providers                 |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------- | :---------------------------------- |
| Blue Sprig                                                                       | Forta       | Elemy                               |
| Center for Autism and Related Disorders (CARD)                                   | Echo Systems | Cortica                             |
| Autism Learning Partners                                                         | Spectrum.Ai | Positive Development                |

**PE-backed platforms:** PE-backed platforms are focused on acquisition and optimization of existing centers (rather than increasing supply with new centers), often focus on clinics that have been around for decades with no real foundation for quality growth, and utilize little to no technology.

*   **Blue Sprig (founded 2017; KKR):** BlueSprig is exclusively focused on traditional ABA therapy. BlueSprig was founded in Houston in 2017 and was acquired by KKR in 2018. Since 2018, BlueSprig has made 10 acquisitions to grow its footprint to 160+ clinics across 15+ states. KKR was typically acquiring clinics in the 10-15X EBITDA range. Florida Autism Center, for example, was acquired for $120M on $10M clinic-level EBITDA.
*   **Center for Autism and Learning Disorders (CARD) (Founded 1990):** CARD had 100 clinics and was valued at $700M when Blackstone acquired a 70% stake in the company in 2018. CARD filed for bankruptcy earlier this year after reducing its clinic footprint from 221 locations in 24 states in 2022 to 130 clinics today. High debt, rapid expansion, and acquisition of existing low-quality providers ultimately led to its demise.
*   **Autism Learning Partners (ALP; Founded 1988):** Provides ABA as well as speech, occupational, physical, and diagnostic services. Great Point Partners acquisition of ALP in 2010 formed the first PE-backed platform in the space, and then FFL acquired Autism Learning Partners in a $270M deal in 2017.

**Tech**

*   **Spectrum.AI ($20M Series A in Q1 ‘23 led by CVS Health Ventures):** Offers 2 solutions - twyll (ABA EHR for providers) and patterns (ABA network analytics). The company recently signed a deal with LEARN Behavioral (5000 providers in 19 states) with CARR of $15M ($250/provider/month). Spectrum also has payer/provider pilots in development with Evernorth (expedited authorization), Humana (UM/audit efficiencies for Tricare), and Optum and Elevance (express self-insured employer access to high-quality providers)
*   **Forta (~$20M in total funding led by Insight Partners; raised uncapped note in 2022).** In 2022, Forta hit a $2.5M+ run-rate by acquiring patients D2C and directly billing parent training CPT codes. Forta is heavily invested in using AI to automate the generation of the therapy program (based on medical record data, eye movement, speech patterns, etc) and reduce the need for RBTs. They are pursuing FDA breakthrough designation to reduce the need for RBTs in the workflow.
*   **Echo Systems (Virtue investment; $2m Seed):** Echo is building patient and provider-facing technology to facilitate parental involvement in autism therapy and an assessment clearinghouse to enable health plans to measure and standardize high-quality autism care. Echo is in early conversations with health plans as it builds out its product (payer, provider, and patient-facing).

**VC-backed platforms**

*   **Elemy (founded in 2019, $1.15B valuation, $300M+ in funding from Softbank, GC, 8VC, and others):** Started scaling ABA clinics in CA, FL, and TX, reaching a $18M run-rate in 2022. The company is currently shifting to a marketplace model to link families to entrepreneurial BCBA's to start their own practices leveraging Elemy's tech platform and services (e.g., insurance contracting + credentialing, client acquisition, RCM, etc).
*   **Cortica (Founded 2014; $115M Series D in 2023):** Cortica has 20+ clinics in 7 states and offers in clinic and at-home autism therapy. The company also offers developmental therapy (speech, occupational therapy) but is more focused on the behavioral-medical integration of care. Cortica has MD's that offer genetic sequencing, medication management, and nutrition evaluation. Cortica has struggled with its in-home business (lower margin, more wasted technician time) but has been able to sign bundled arrangements with payers with higher overall reimbursement.
*   **Positive Development (Founded 2019; $40.2M Raised; 18 Clinics):** Positive Development is live in 6 states and offers in clinic, home, or virtual visits. The company finished 2022 with 655 patients and $7.2M in net patients services revenue. Positive Development is similarly focused on developmental approaches but struggled initially because it led with VBC out of the gate, rather than generating outcomes in FFS prior to securing VBC contracts.

## GTM

Anna is preparing for the launch of its first clinic in January in Sudbury, MA, and has a playbook for identifying and launching additional clinics in MA and expanding to new markets.

As shown below, the clinic footprint even around high-density metro areas like Boston is limited. In Sudbury and the 2 towns around it (Concord, Framingham), there is a population of 100K+, which equates to 500+ children with autism in the area. Anna only needs to enroll 10 to break even, and the average daily census (ADC) for each clinic is 60. Through research and work in the Sudbury region, the Anna team has identified high waitlists for surrounding ABA clinics, a sign of demand in market they can capitalize on. Anna has already hired its core clinical team and set up payer contracting with Medicaid plans in the region, with Tufts as the plan with highest market share.

With Aimun's experience from Triple Aim, he has already developed a repeatable de-novo and inorganic growth playbook to select new markets based on the below characteristics. This same strategy was used to select Sudbury.

*   **Demographics:** High autism prevalence and growth in diagnosis rates
*   **Reimbursement:** Attractive payments rates and underlying trends for ABA and VBC
*   **Competitive dynamics:** Limited market saturation and gaps in care (e.g., waitlists)
*   **Access to qualified workforce:** Availability of qualified professionals and training programs
*   **Regulatory environments:** Few limitations in coverage with underlying tailwinds for care.

## Financials

Anna is building a sustainable and high margin business based on FFS rates alone to set the company up for VBC in the future. It is important to have a high-margin business in FFS alone so Anna can enter markets and have leverage with payers for VBC conversations. Throughout the model, it's important to note that VBC (specifically any bundled rates) are not included for conservative projections. Over time, bundles will lock in the same high reimbursement rates (>$100K per average daily census (ADC)) but provide more flexibility in care which will allow them to increase margins (43.6% → 45-50% clinic level EBITDA).

The major takeaway, as explained in the deck, is that for a $150K annual lease, 1 clinic has a payback period of 8 months and can generate pay back in ~8 months and generate enough cash flow at maturity (~12 months) to fund 8x+ additional clinics to profitability. We qualitatively walk through the pro-forma to highlight why this model is so attractive.

**Clinic-level:** Each clinic requires $165K in CapEx to launch, 10 patients to break-even, 60 patients to generate $3M+ in cash flow in Y2, and can generate 40+% clinic-level EBITDA margins. Patients require treatment for at least 3 years on average once they enter an Anna clinic, leading to high LTV for patients driving ~$500 in revenue per day.

**Market-level:** With 1 clinic generating $3m+ in cash flow at maturity, Anna can feasibly fund an entire market with 1 clinic's operations since it is able to keep corporate overhead (non-clinical FTE expenses) so low (~1% of net patient service revenue). We like businesses like Anna that can drive $30-$50M in net revenue in a single market. It doesn't require a nationwide footprint to build a massive business in this space.

**Anna as a whole:** Exit multiples for autism treatment centers have been in the 10-15x EBITDA range over the last few years given the excitement in the space, but we see multiples correcting to a healthier historical range of 5-10X. Based on Anna's projected EBITDA in 2026 and beyond, we ran a scenario analysis based on these multiples to see what it would take to return the fund.

For a typical care delivery business, we would assume 50% dilution at exit. Given the dynamics noted above, Aimun's commitment to capital efficient growth, and favorable tailwinds we are seeing in the space, we think this is closer to 30%. For exit ranges from $300-$600M, we have the potential to return the fund (assuming 7.50% ownership at exit for <$100M EBITDA and 5% ownership at exit for $100M+ in EBITDA).

## Opportunties and Risks

### Opportunities

*   **Capital Efficient Delivery Business with Key Attributes We Look for:** Not all care delivery models are venture scalable so we focus on businesses that 1) are looking to scale validated clinical models, 2) have low patient acquisition costs, 3) potential for 50+% care margins, and 4) clear attribution of value. Anna has all 4 of these plus a management team and early foundation to scale the business in a capital efficient manner. Anna can generate $30-$50M in net revenue in a single market without being reliant on external capital infusions.
*   **Non-obvious Market Timing:** Given all the PE investment over the last 10 years and recent failures of some high-profile companies (e.g., CARD bankruptcy), many other investors and management teams may view these trends as a chilling effect and ignore the space. We and the Anna management team recognize that tailwinds in the space (increasing prevalence, cost, and defined reimbursement) will continue to drive strong demand. The failure of PE-backed clinics like CARD provides additional clinical supply for Anna to hire and allows it to differentiate on quality when selling to payers. In addition, the outcomes data for NDBI has continue to grow over the years, enabling Anna to be the one to scale/implement these strategies rather than fighting an uphill battle for validation.
*   **Early Momentum for High-upside Healthcare Operator:** Every successful investment in the Virtue portfolio shares 1 simple, but common characteristic: early momentum prior to funding. Before raising a single dollar of external capital, Aimun has brought on his initial clinical team, credentialed his providers, secured FFS contracts with 3 major medicaid plans in a region, identified his first clinic and initial referral partners. Aimun spent the last 2 years at Triple Aim helping to launch 5+ care delivery businesses, the perfect training ground prior to launching Anna.

### Risks

*   **Scale Erodes Clinical Quality:** Initially, the focus is on maintaining clinical excellence as a differentiator for hiring, referrals and favorable payer contracting. As with all care delivery organizations, there is a risk that this clinical quality erodes at scale in favor of growth (similar to PE players). To mitigate this risk, Anna is starting from day one by not only hiring the best providers, but focusing on long-term retention by paying them better salaries, incentivizing them with equity, and providing training opportunities for them to upskill over time.
*   **Labor Supply Inadequate.** The labor shortages in the US provider market are only getting worse over the next 5-10 years and Anna is dependent on high-quality clinical supply. Anna has already proved prior to funding that it can recruit clinicians away from world-renowned institutions (e.g., Helena Costa) and tap into clinical supply from other clinics that have shut down. Over time, Anna will begin to create its own supply by going to University programs to train clinicians in NDBI. It's important to note the current training process for RBTs is only 12 weeks.
*   **Failure to Get to VBC:** Anna is an attractive business with FFS reimbursement alone, but VBC (specifically bundled rates with payers) would allow Anna to drive care margins to 50+% and invest this additional margin back in the business. While not a necessity in the short-term, Medicaid rates have been flat over the last few years, effectively equating to declining reimbursement rates given inflation and increased labor costs. We and management have confidence in getting to bundles in geographies of interest given the precedence set by other players in the space (e.g., Cortica) with subpar clinical models.
