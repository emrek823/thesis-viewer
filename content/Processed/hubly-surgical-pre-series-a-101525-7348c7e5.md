## Slide 3: A new category of intelligent surgical instruments.
*   A new category of intelligent surgical instruments.
*   We transformed cranial drilling. We're coming for the O.R.

## Slide 4: Executive summary
*   Hubly has the best and most consistent surgical drilling technology on the market, with **demonstrated 100% effective auto-stop and a 93% retention rate**
*   Our first product is a single-use drill for the neuro ICU. With just 2 sales employees, we've sold **6,500+ drills ($4.5M revenue)** with **95 hospitals VAC-approved** and **120+ in process**
*   Existing neurosurgeon customers are **demanding Hubly technology across their cranial and spinal use-cases**

## Slide 5: Today, surgical drilling and cutting are dangerous
### Dangerous
*   No safety mechanism; surgeries often result in plunging

### Challenging
*   Especially in less common procedures

### Slow
*   Time is critical, yet professionals must work cautiously; sometimes need 2 professionals

## Slide 6: $3B market involving 30M procedures
*   **CRANIAL**
    *   Neurosurgeons
    *   1.5M procedures
*   **SPINE**
    *   Specialists (neuro & ortho)
    *   4M procedures
*   **REST OF BODY**
    *   Orthopedic surgeons
    *   25M procedures

*Note: Procedure numbers are preliminary estimates*

## Slide 9: Hubly's SMART Auto-Stop is uniquely effective
*   Most competitors offer **no protection**
*   Those who do offer protection rely on **pressure** to stop device
    *   Slows operation, device cannot be restarted
*   Uniquely, Hubly uses **current draw** on motor as stop mechanism
    *   Permits safe, speedy work with ability to restart
    *   Current increases at point of puncture, triggering motor shut-off in proprietary algo
    *   Tapered bit prevents plunge following shut-off

### CURRENT DRAW WHILE HUBLY DRILLING
| Seconds | Current | Event               |
| :------ | :------ | :------------------ |
| 0.00    | 0.2     |                     |
| ...     | ...     | DIPLOË              |
| ~12.00  | ~0.4    |                     |
| ~16.00  | ~0.8    | POINT OF PUNCTURE   |
| ~17.00  | ~1.1    |                     |
| ~17.50  | ~0.1    | HUBLY AUTO-STOP     |
| 20.00   | ~0.1    |                     |

*   **Eliminates 100% of brain plunge** (Demonstrated clinical data)
*   **Reduces cranial dural penetrations by >90% vs. hand crank** (Kilgallon et al. 2025)

*   **25% OF HUBLY HOSPITALS USE HUBLY DRILL IN THE O.R. TODAY**

## Slide 14: Dominating O.R. Cranial
### O.R. Cranial (FDA-Cleared)
*   **Customers:** Neurosurgeons
*   **Competitors:**
    *   Cranial Perforator: stops early with no restart capability. Often results in adverse events w/ FDA warnings.
*   **Procedures:**
    *   VP Shunt Placement for hydrocephalus
    *   Brain Biopsy for tumor diagnosis
    *   LITT for tumors
    *   SEEG for epilepsy
    *   DBS for Parkinson's disease
    *   Ommaya Reservoir placement for chemotherapy

### Testimonials
*   "I use the Hubly Drill for EVDs. It's faster, easier to use, and reassuring to not worry about over-drilling. Once the O.R. cranial sizes are available, I'd replace my current drills with Hubly. It's an upgrade over the perforator and the other tools we use today."
    *   **DR. NASSIR MANSOUR, MD**, Chief of Neurosurgery, Wyckoff Heights
*   "The Hubly Drill for EVDs is fantastic. It combines precision with safety in a way that improves patient care. I look forward to future iterations with larger drill bit sizes, which will make it an indispensable tool not just in the Neuro ICU, but across the O.R. and angiosuite."
    *   **DR. LUIS SAVASTANO, MD, PHD**, Co-Chief Neuro-Endovascular Surgery, UCSF
*   "We use the Hubly Drill at our center, and I'm eager to have the Hubly sizes needed to fully replace the cranial perforator—especially for residents, where early stop without restart is a huge challenge. Hubly's auto-stop could finally bring a safe option to SEEG and endonasal procedures where no such solution currently exists."
    *   **DR. SEYED ALIREZA MANSOURI, MD**, Associate Professor and Neurosurgeon, Penn State

## Slide 15: Expanding to Spine in 2026
### Spinal Decompression (510(k)-pending)
*   **Customers:** Neurosurgeons, Ortho-surgeons
*   **Competitors:**
    *   Stryker / Medtronic M8 Matchstick: no auto-stop
    *   Misonix Bone Scalpel: ‘tissue-sparing' but lacks speed → slow to adopt
*   **Procedures:**
    *   Laminectomy / Laminotomy
    *   Discectomy
    *   Spinal tumors

### Testimonials
*   "I'm very eager to use the Hubly Drill for spinal tumor and decompression surgeries. The newer oscillating tools for spine are loud, slow, heat up excessively, and their tissue-sparing never works as well as hoped. Hubly, by contrast, is quiet, fast, doesn't overheat, and auto-stopped consistently in our lab. In cadaver testing, it was reliably safe and far better than the options we use and have trialed."
    *   **DR. KIEFER FORSETH, MD**, Neurosurgeon, UC San Diego Health
*   "It's worked perfectly every time [in neuro ICU]. I love that thing."
*   "I use the matchstick burr in my practice, and in our cadaver lab, the Hubly Drill felt safer for the dura and faster for the patient. Sign me up."
    *   **DR. DAVID SANTIAGO-DIEPPA, MD**, Neuro-Spine Surgeon, UC San Diego Health
