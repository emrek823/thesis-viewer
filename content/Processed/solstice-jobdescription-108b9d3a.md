SOLSTICE HEALTH - FOUNDING ENGINEER COMPANY OVERVIEW:

Solstice automates the medical records retrieval process for community practices across the United States, starting with cancer clinics. Our mission is to make it easier for providers to have the information they need about their patient’s prior medical history so that they can deliver the best care possible. We’ve raised $3mm+ from investors like Virtue, Twelve Below, and the founders of Datavant, Commure, and Paradigm. We are currently live with community oncology practices and are looking to expand rapidly.

Prior to a patient’s initial visit, community practices need access to their prior medical records from a variety of health systems in order to appropriately provide care. These records include imaging reports, progress notes, and labs that indicate a patient’s diagnosis and treatment history. Currently, this process is done entirely manually. Solstice automates this process by retrieving, filtering, and structuring this information into easily-readable reports for clinicians.

70% of specialty care patients are treated in the community, yet no one has been able to tap into this ecosystem due to archaic systems and cost prohibitive models of the past. Riding the growth of adoption of health information networks and LLMs, our vision is to create the first proprietary data network of community practices around the country, to store and exchange unique patient information and referral patterns not previously accessible.
