## Slide 4: Every manual step is a delay, a risk, or a missed saving

*   **Critical supplier data is scattered across emails, PDFs, and shared drives**
    *   Leading to delays, duplication, and missed insights during evaluations or escalations.
*   **No early warning system for geopolitical or tariff shifts**
    *   leaving teams blind to sudden disruptions that impact raw material sourcing.
*   **Vendor performance issues are discovered too late**
    *   leading to batch delays, escalations, or emergency re-sourcing.
*   **High-cost suppliers are used by default**
    *   because there's no automated way to identify approved alternatives in lower-risk geographies.
*   **Analyst time is drained by repetitive research and manual reporting**
    *   Instead of driving strategy, teams chase data, compile dashboards, and recreate the same insights repeatedly.
*   **Supplier onboarding takes 6-8 months**
    *   due to manual discovery and vetting processes
