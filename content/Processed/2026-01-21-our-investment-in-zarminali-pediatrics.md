Access to high-quality, affordable pediatric care is increasingly out of reach for many families in the U.S. With fragmented networks, overburdened clinicians, and rising costs, the challenges in pediatric healthcare demand innovative solutions. That’s why General Catalyst is excited to announce our seed investment in Zarminali Pediatrics, a forward-thinking company on a mission to close the gaps in pediatric care through an integrated, multi-specialty approach.

Zarminali Pediatrics, led by industry veteran Danish Qureshi, is reimagining how care is delivered in pediatrics. Drawing on his experience as former co-founder, President & COO of Lifestance Health (Nasdaq: LFST), where he helped lead the company’s impressive growth and operational innovation, Danish brings what we think is a unique perspective on healthcare transformation. By integrating a multi-specialty model with a technology-forward approach, Zarminali Pediatrics aims to create a seamless experience for patients and clinicians alike. This model addresses not only general pediatric needs but also provides easier access to specialized care—eliminating the need for multiple referrals and long wait times that so often hinder timely treatment. We believe this approach is a crucial step toward more consistent, coordinated care across the pediatric spectrum.

Currently structured around a commercial fee-for-service model, Zarminali Pediatrics' strategy includes a planned transition to value-based care over time. By starting with a strong foundation in fee-for-service, Zarminali seeks to  establish operational efficiency, build patient and clinician trust, and demonstrate measurable outcomes. As they grow, Zarminali is preparing to adopt value-based payment models to further align incentives around high-quality, efficient care.

Zarminali Pediatrics aims to scale its pediatric network to a national footprint over the coming  years through both organic and inorganic growth strategies. This will allow them to reach more families while enhancing practices through standardized support, unified operations, and best in class technology integrations. Zarminali’s model is designed to reduce administrative burdens on clinicians, boost operational efficiency, and ultimately enable clinicians to spend more time focused on patient care. By making quality care more accessible and reducing clinician burnout, we believe Zarminali is setting a new standard in pediatric health – one that children and families truly deserve.

At General Catalyst, we’re proud to support Zarminali Pediatrics in this journey to transform pediatric healthcare. We see this investment as an essential part of our Health Assurance thesis—bringing together technology, innovative care models, and responsible growth strategies to create a healthier, more equitable future.
