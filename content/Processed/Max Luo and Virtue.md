### Max’s Conviction on EMR Disruption

- Max’s story: More and more conviction for this idea - every single person, doctor, and practice manager he talks to confirms this is the way the world is headed
- Core problems driving the opportunity:
	- Consolidation running up against existing EMRs
	- Not being able to achieve real ROI until you own the whole thing
	- Point solutions can only replace 1-2 nurses on specific teams
- Provider needs are dramatic:
	- Need to increase revenue by 10%
	- Need to cut opex by 50%
	- Driven by Medicare/Medicaid cuts coming
	- Nurse staffing inflation cost increasing 3-5% annually
	- Mass unemployment in 5-10 years will force hospitals to absorb more patients
- Business dynamics: EMRs are the biggest bucket of spend in practices/hospitals by far
	- Control significant trust - practices wait to use point solutions because EMR says it’s on roadmap
	- Only position to build $100B company: national payer, national hospital chain, or EMR

### Go-to-Market Strategy and Product Vision

- Core approach: Most EMRs are billing systems because billing is most important thing for providers
	- Billing is also biggest cost center for provider
	- Starting in RCM because billing needs AI intelligence to understand payer dynamics
	- Clinical documentation (CDI) and prescribing easier transitions from RCM than scheduling
- Market entry tactics:
	- Some practices use mix of different systems - current practice has Athena ($900k spend) and NextTech ($75k spend)
	- NextTech and NextGen have weak spots, particularly in ophthalmology
	- NextTech only used for clinical documentation, Athena for scheduling/billing
- Relationship building: Playing golf with the right people - current customer wants to invest and has made intros
	- Customer organizes Retina Conference for West Coast practices (Max will sponsor)
	- Invited to Athena Conference in Nashville end of October
- Product evolution: Will be extremely different from today’s EMRs
	- In world where AI does 80-90% of work, surface only 10-20% to end users
	- Goal: minimize clicks, eventually move to voice/avatar interfaces
	- Smaller practices will adopt faster due to fewer decision makers and simpler processes

### Fundraising and Technical Challenges

- Funding plans: Raising $3-5M to hire product engineers and build out portfolio
	- Great partner customer to help build this out
	- Timeline: next 1-2 weeks, mostly talking to people he’s known for a while
- Biggest technical hurdle: Replacing Athena for scheduling and billing
	- Chief Architect of Athena: 7,000 of 8,000 employees are labor doing reconciliation on EOBs
	- Athena makes customers use their bank account, gets all EOBs, has bank scan everything
	- Current customer has built custom rules and sophisticated setup
	- May need to chunk off certain payers, regions, or handle long-tail local HMOs first
- Distribution strategy: Imaging machine distributors for ophthalmology could provide distribution
	- After $5-10M ARR, strategic partnerships will be very important
	- Referenced Vocera getting to $100M through direct sales, then hundreds of millions through Vizient distributors
