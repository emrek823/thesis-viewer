# Slope - Seed Pitch Deck (Q4 2019)

**Data-driven clinical trial supply chain management.**

Rust Felix - Co-Founder & CEO

## Problem

**94% of clinical trials are delayed more than a month. Delays cost $600K to $8M per day.**

Trial Sponsors lose hundreds of millions of dollars because their supply chains are too complex for people to manage:

- **Trial Vendors:** Drug, device, kit, and supply distribution is reactive
- **Research Sites:** No systems exist to help sites manage inventory & orders
- **Study Patients:** No easy way to forecast patient inventory requirements
- **Analytical Labs:** Ensuring samples end up at the right labs requires lots of PM

## Solution

First connected clinical supply chain management platform that ensures everyone knows where everything is.

**Before Slope:** Inaccurate forecasts cause study delays
- Sponsors, CROs, and Vendors don't have visibility into clinical inventory usage at trial sites
- Spreadsheet models and simulations relied on for demand forecasting and PM
- Site demand isn't balanced with vendor supply

**With Slope:** Data powers supply chain automation
- Sites use Slope to manage their inventory
- ClinOps teams connected to data in real-time
- Vendors improve distribution accuracy with better inventory mgmt
