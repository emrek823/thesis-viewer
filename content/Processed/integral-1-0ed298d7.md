Pipeline update

LiveRamp

Recession planning so moving a little slower

Komodo

Expert certifications - specifically around tech-based product. No flexibility around human reviews.

Whiteboard session

Outlining how we work, how we implement, technical details, zooming back out

Even better partnership than LiveRamp can be

PurpleLab

Direct customer

Solve it directly for them

Milestones for the next fundraise: We've discussed this a ton throughout the financing but let's commit to 2-3 must-have milestones to trigger a successful seed/Series A. From there we can work backwards and think about what the next 3/6/12 months look like more tactically.

Communication cadence: Let's plan to set up a call every 2-3 weeks. Do Friday mornings typically work best for you guys?

Monthly updates: Let's agree on a rough template (red/yellow/green status for progress, focus areas in product, commercial, hiring, etc) for the monthly updates. It's super valuable not only for us and other investors to stay in the loop and help where needed but also a good way to take a step back and see what worked well and what didn't over the past month. We see a high correlation between regular, monthly reporting at pre-seed & seed with long-term success. Monthly reporting is also data room material for the next round.

Resources: We will share some of our resources in airtable (advisors/KOLs in our network, downstream investors, tech vendors) and partnerships on the hiring side (Aequitas and Out of Pocket) that we provide for portfolio companies.

Hiring: Let's talk through an update on hiring and how you're thinking about the rest of this year, particularly with additional engineering talent, pharma BD, and statisticians to bring in house.

Engineering: 3 engineers hired as soon as possible. 2 of those have to be senior

DevOps engineer - someone who is automating DevOps workflows, security permissions, supporting data

Built a full-stack product

Fundamentals of compute, spun up, spun down

Canonically - 4 years in some sort of data/devops

Data Engineer - managing the pipeline. 2 candidates that are warm

Backend engineer - 2 candidates that are warm

Statistician

Brad

Pharma BD

John - front end and client facing application

Sales materials: Let's update sales materials. We'll share some sales resources that have worked very well for other portfolio companies.

Hypothesis

If we have a technology that flexible platform that integrates with all other analytics players, we create a compliance layer that everyone uses. Can we take a consulting process and automate?

Tech first

Have a contract ready (LOI) with a pharma company at the end of 12 months

SLAs

Can we turn it around in a week? Can we guarantee hors? Can collaboration happen (no zoom, no phone calls)

Product perspective

Preparing to own data (Vanta, SOC2, other things)

Staff to support a larger pipeline

Data warehouse internally to support the ETL lifecycle

Key milestones

2-3 channel partnerships (LiveRamp and Komodo) 1.5-2m in ARR

Client makeup of 6-10

Be ready to own data

LOI from a pharma company

Next 3-4 months

Work with pharma companies to put these case studies together
