## Built for Clinicians by Clinicians

By reducing cognitive load for clinicians, minimizing QA rework, and accelerating time to reimbursement, we improve the daily experience of post-acute teams. In turn, this leads to better care delivery — and better outcomes for every patient.

### Reduce Documentation Time

We simplify review and documentation so clinicians can focus their energy where it matters most: the patient.

### Support Post-Acute Workers

### Cut QA Rework

By flagging issues early and improving data accuracy, we reduce back-and-forth and boost QA team productivity.

### Speed Up Reimbursement

Our platform helps agencies move faster from care delivery to clean claims — reducing delays and denials.

## How Steno Works

![Step 1: Capture visualization](/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fhow-steno-works-1.png&w=3840&q=100)

### Step 1: Capture

#### Smarter Input, Less Work

We ingest visit audio, notes, discharge summaries, and more so clinicians can focus on patient care — not paperwork.

![Step 2: Draft visualization](/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fhow-steno-works-2.png&w=3840&q=100)

### Step 2: Draft

#### Fast, Accurate Drafts Tailored to Your Visit

Steno's AI generates a full OASIS draft, linking every answer to your actual visit notes—with confidence scores and source references built in.

![Step 3: Review visualization](/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fhow-steno-works-3.png&w=3840&q=100)

### Step 3: Review

#### You Know the Patient Best

Clinicians are guided through a compliance focused review process that highlights inconsistencies or missing answers.

![Step 4: Submit visualization](/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fhow-steno-works-4.png&w=3840&q=100)

### Step 4: Submit

#### One Tap, Fully Documented

With everything checked and reviewed, submission is fast and compliant—freeing you up for what matters next.

## You Stay in Control

The AI listens, drafts, and flags gaps, but you make the final call.

## AI designed around your unique clinical workflows

Every agency works differently. Steno adapts to your workflows, QA process, and data needs to help you work faster, with fewer errors and cleaner claims.

* Configure assessments per visit type (SOC, Recert, Discharge)
* Adjust QA triggers and validation rules to match your process
* Customize exports for EMR and billing pipelines
* Enable PDGM-specific logic where it matters
* Use real-time feedback loops to improve adoption

## What Our Users Say

Real Stories of Improved Home Care and Efficiency

"The software's been a game changer for our weekend coverage."

---

Lorri W

RN

"I do a lot of SOCs, and anything that makes the OASIS less painful is a win. The speech-to-text is decent, but what's more useful is how it fills in the actual sections automatically."

---

Joshua J

PT

"Super fast turnaround — I get the draft back in minutes."

---

Michael T

PT

"Wasn't sure what to expect, but it actually picked up most of what I said during the visit. I still had to fill in a few things, but it was way faster than doing the whole SOC from scratch."

---

Rachel M

RN

"Took a week or so but now I'm starting to get it."
