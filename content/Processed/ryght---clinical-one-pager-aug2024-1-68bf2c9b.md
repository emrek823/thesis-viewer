## Customer Testimonial

“Our NIMBC clinical research program greatly benefited from the Ryght platform. As a clinical researcher, I heavily relied on the platform’s literature review applications to delve into cytokine ratios and cytokine diagnostics used in patient treatment. Our scientific team had previously explored this, but not to the extent that the Ryght tool was able to in a brief time. Through Ryght, we were able to access comprehensive information and gain new perspectives into areas the Ryght tool had newly identified. This is like having a graduate student or research resource dedicated to our project. The Ryght tool was able to identify some cytokine relationships we had not explored, and it provided a rapid summary with documented literature sources. This not only saved us valuable time and resources, but also expanded our knowledge in understanding our PD results. Thanks to Ryght, we were empowered to advance our research efficiently and effectively.
