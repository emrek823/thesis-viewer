## Slide 17: Worked to available shifts.
Worked to available shifts.

**(Chart: Bar chart showing "Available shifts" and "Worked shifts" per 7 days over time, with a "covid" annotation in 2020.)**

**Key takeaways from chart:**
*   Unfilled shifts represent an immediate opportunity to double revenue by growing supply.
*   Available shifts have substantially increased with new enterprise customers.
*   Worked shifts are growing at a similar rate.

**Approximate data points for Available shifts (light blue bars) and Worked shifts (dark blue bars) per 7 days:**

| 2020-01-01 | 750                      | 400                   |

| (Latest point) | 1200-1300                | 600-700               |

*The chart shows a general upward trend for both available and worked shifts, with a noticeable dip around Q2 2020 (COVID-19 impact) and then a sharp increase in available shifts, followed by an increase in worked shifts, creating a wider gap between available and worked shifts in mid-2020.*

**(Bar Chart comparing Nurse CAC and LTV)**

| Metric    | Value     |
| :-------- | :-------- |
| Nurse CAC | $517      |
| LTV       | $1,612    |

**Nurse CAC Breakdown ($517 total):**
*   Referrals: $30.52
*   Paid ads & job boards: $60.99
*   Interviews: $62.41
*   Compliance: $87.49
*   FTEs: $275.94

*   **50% of CAC today is Ops headcount for manual activation tasks that can be automated**

*   **Automation:**
    *   CRM
    *   Marketing & lifecycle marketing
    *   Digital orientation
*   **Volume:** vendor compliance & interview costs go down as volume goes up.
*   **Activation funnel:** lots of low hanging fruit, for example,
    *   we switched signup form from web to native apps;
    *   signup form completion rate increased from 18% to 89% and 54% in iOS & Android, respectively.
*   **Referrals:**
    *   currently 44% of activations & break-even on activation of every referral;
    *   current referral engine is an MVP, further development will increase referral volume.
*   **Cost-sharing:** piloting CAC pass-through to healthcare system.
*   **Content marketing:** starting SEO/content marketing.
*   **Online education:** CEUs for license renewal and credential wallet to access more nurses and expand our value proposition to professionals.

## Slide 23: How we cut down onboarding time of professionals
How we cut down onboarding time of professionals

1)  Legal compliance: APIs hookups
    *   License, Background Checks
2)  Customer-specific requirements: Digitize onto Mobile App
    *   Orientation session
    *   Paperwork
    *   Learning modules
    *   Specific compliance
3)  First-day preceptor shift: Scheduled in app

**Streamlining onboarding allows us to increase our take rate and creates adjacent revenue opportunity**
