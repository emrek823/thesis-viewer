**Drug Development Lifecycle Flow Chart:**

**Investigational New Drug Prep**
→ **Phase 1**
→ **Phase 2**
→ **Phase 3**
→ **New Drug Application**
→ **Commercialization**
→ **Phase 4**

**At each phase of development:**

**Pre**
*   Decision on trial design and geographic footprint dictates protocol, ICF, lab manual content

**During**
*   Decisions implementing strategic changes to trial generate new content requirements

**Post**
*   Decision dictating study report and manuscript
*   Decision on regulatory filing strategy dictating submission content
*   Decision on commercialization strategy & content including marcomms
*   Decision on medical affairs strategy including field-based medicine coverage for prescribers
*   Post approval decisions regarding label expansion, PASS, etc. dictating all necessary regulatory, amendment and submission documents

## Slide 8: Key Customer Pain Points
# Key Customer Pain Points

*   Critical decisions made without comprehensive synthesis of information
*   Outsourced consulting costs are high
*   Manual data reviews create quality issues, time lag
*   Current tools not sophisticated (lack automation, intelligence)
*   Key decisions rely on manually updated documents
*   Amendments and protocol changes cause significant delays

## Slide 9: The Ideal State
# The Ideal State

*   **AI Synthesis:** Critical decision making incorporates fully synthesized scientific, medical, operational, commercial, regulatory information at each step in the drug development journey – driving faster and higher quality outcomes
*   **Workflow:** Stakeholders can coordinate and collaborate effectively through multiple iteration cycles
*   **Predictive:** Trial cost and duration can be accurately predicted
*   **Automated:** Operations are fine tuned in real time
