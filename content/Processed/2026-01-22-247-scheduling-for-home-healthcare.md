### Talk to the Voice AI Now

Get a live call and talk to Phoebe yourself

Each of your schedulers lose 2-5 (or more!) hours a day chasing down coverage for last minute shifts

Manual coordination efforts waste time, delay shift coverage, burn out staff, and leave clients short-handed longer than necessary.

### Call Out Coverage

Automatically contacts every qualified backup **the moment a caregiver cancels**, locks in the first "yes," and closes the loop for everyone involved.

### Shift Confirmation

Sends smart reminders before each visit, captures a quick yes/no from each caregiver, and alerts the **Call Out Coverage Assistant** if shift coverage will be needed.

### Time Tracking

Pings caregivers with clock-in/out reminders, monitors for missed clock-ins/outs, and ensures all schedules, systems, and client records are accurate and up to date.

### Availability & Preferences

Proactively keeps in touch with caregivers about their availability, location, and preferences to ensure the right people are surfaced when shifts need coverage.
