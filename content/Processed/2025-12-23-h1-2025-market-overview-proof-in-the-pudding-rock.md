# H1 2025 market overview: Proof in the pudding

The first half of 2025 played like a highlight reel: [big rounds](https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/24/in-just-4-months-ai-medical-scribe-abridge-doubles-valuation-to-5-3b/) for AI-powered solutions (with even more capital [rumored](https://www.newcomer.co/p/scoop-openevidence-an-ai-assistant)), unprecedented provider tooling [adoption](https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/healthcare-ai-adoption-data-and-integration-challenges-persist) and [impact](https://academic.oup.com/jamiaopen/article/8/1/ooaf013/8029407), and [IPOs](https://www.modernhealthcare.com/digital-health/hinge-omada-ipo-abridge-2025/) for longstanding digital health darlings. With a steady funding pace mirroring the past couple of years, the digital health sector saw several long-awaited developments signaling market maturity and momentum. But that highlight reel played against an economic and policy backdrop that is anything but steady.

This piece explores H1’s validating moments—the thawing of the IPO market and the growth of AI-native provider tools capturing investor attention and provider loyalty—as “proof points” of digital health’s promise to deliver [validated](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39794797/), [patient-centric](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250331285092/en/New-Data-Demonstrates-Behavioral-Mental-and-Physical-Health-Benefits-of-Omada-Healths-Cardiometabolic-Programs), affordable care. We’ll also take a dip into the [uncharted](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/tariffs-aha-med-tech-brace-for-impact/744496/) [waters](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/providers/providence-announces-difficult-necessary-restructure-cutting-600-positions?utm_medium=email&utm_source=nl&utm_campaign=HC-NL-FierceHealthcare&oly_enc_id=5390C6361767B2Z) on the health policy [horizon](https://www.statnews.com/2025/07/02/trump-tax-cut-bill-changes-for-health-care-medicaid-cuts-aca-obamacare-hsa-rural-health-hospitals/). But first, let’s take a look at where investors are placing their bets.

## More than just business as usual

By the numbers, H1 2025 saw a modest increase in digital health venture funding compared to the past two years, signaling a steady venture market that’s found its footing after the pandemic-driven boom. Investors poured $6.4B into US-based digital health companies across 245 deals in the first half of the year, up from $6.0B in H1 2024 and $6.2B in H1 2023. In Q2 alone, the sector brought in $3.4B in venture funding—up from the average of $2.6B per quarter since Q1 2023.

This year saw fewer deals (245) compared to last year’s first half (273). If H2 continues at this pace, this year could yield the lowest overall deal count since 2020. Despite fewer deals, average deal size grew ($26.1M compared to $20.4M in 2024), spurred by larger investments in later stage rounds (Series B-D1) as well as the bolstering impact of AI.

## AI buzz is biz

For the first time, AI-enabled startups2 captured a majority (62%) of digital health venture funding in H1 2025. These companies, on average, raised $34.4M in funding per round—a whopping 83% premium compared to the $18.8M of their non-AI-enabled3 counterparts. While this premium was partly driven by supersized growth rounds, it was also evident in early stage deals: the average Series A and Series B deal sizes for AI-enabled startups were $24.4M and $54.8M respectively, compared to $15.6M and $39.6M for non-AI-enabled digital health companies.

Overall, the top three funded value propositions (VPs) of digital health startups in H1 2025 were: non-clinical workflow ($1.9B), clinical workflow ($1.9B), and data infrastructure ($893M)—all of which are being transformed by [AI-enablement](https://rockhealth.com/insights/from-buzzword-to-business-case-constructing-ai-use-cases-for-pharma/) and [automation](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidprosser/2025/06/24/slashing-healthcare-costs-with-cutting-edge-ai-and-automation/). These VPs drew more than half (55%) of overall digital health funding in H1—a first in our data since we began tracking venture funding back in 2011.

H1 2025 recorded 11 mega deals (fundraises over $100M), on pace to surpass the 17 mega deals we saw throughout 2024. Nine of the 11 mega deals [went to](https://www.statnews.com/2025/01/15/health-tech-venture-capital-startup-investments-2025-artificial-intelligence/) AI-enabled startups—with Abridge, a top competitor in the AI scribe space, announcing two mega rounds in just four months’ time. Back-to-back mega deals within even a year’s time frame is a feat few companies have achieved since 2021.4 And we’re only in the first half of the year—newly minted unicorn OpenEvidence is rumored to be on the [verge](https://www.newcomer.co/p/scoop-openevidence-an-ai-assistant) of a mega deal after its [$75M](https://www.axios.com/pro/health-tech-deals/2025/02/20/openevidence-valued-at-1b-sequoia-75m-series-a) Series A in February. Let’s take a closer look at what’s driving this investor confidence.

## In the flow, not in the way

The relationship between clinicians and new technology hasn’t always been a [smooth ride](https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/whats-behind-ehr-induced-clinician-burnout-and-how-solve-it), which makes the recent surge in [adoption](https://medcitynews.com/2025/06/healthcare-ai-ambient-scribe-burnout-clinician/) of AI tools (particularly ambient documentation and medical reference solutions) so remarkable. Strong [outcomes](https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2025/02/study-suggests-physician-s-medical-decisions-benefit-from-chatbot) and clear [impact](https://academic.oup.com/jamiaopen/article/8/1/ooaf013/8029407) for clinicians have driven the rapid adoption of medical ambient documentation tools—[faster](https://www.mobihealthnews.com/news/phti-report-finds-ambient-scribes-set-be-fastest-tech-adopted-healthcare) than any other technology in healthcare history.5 Today, overall adoption rates hover between [30%](https://journal.ahima.org/page/as-interest-in-ambient-ai-grows-hi-professionals-focus-on-clinical-documentation) and [40%](https://www.mgma.com/sponsored-solutions/ambient-ai-solution-adoption-2024) across physician groups, with some leading hospitals reporting utilization [as high as 90%](https://www.wsj.com/health/healthcare/ai-ambient-listening-doctor-appointment-e7afd587).

Consider [Abridge](https://www.abridge.com/)—the ambient documentation solution is deployed at over 100 U.S. health systems, and [continues](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/abridge-mayo-clinic-ai-documentation-partnership/737339/) expanding its list of [enterprise](https://hitconsultant.net/2025/02/25/athenahealth-partners-with-abridge-to-bring-ambient-ai-to-ambulatory-care/) partners and its set of [use cases](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/ai-and-machine-learning/abridge-offers-generative-ai-tool-emergency-medicine-emory-healthcare-johns) and [features](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/health-tech/abridge-launches-gen-ai-tool-inpatient-clinicians-adds-outpatient-orders-feature). Abridge’s sustained momentum stems not only from proving [value](https://hitconsultant.net/2025/05/02/sutter-health-study-finds-ambient-ai-reduces-documentation-time/?hashed_user=0ecc4c74713aba4c97501205e74405db&utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=5.27.25%20Hospitalogy&utm_term=Hospitalogy) and earning trust, but also from [strategic partnerships](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/ai-and-machine-learning/abridge-wolters-kluwer-health-ink-partnership-integrate-uptodate-ai-medical) and clear plans for long-term growth. Abridge became the [first](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/health-tech/abridge-inks-epic-partnership-emory-healthcare-tie-its-generative-ai-tech) “pal” in Epic’s Partners and Pals program, enabling native integration into clinical workflows. And expectations for Abridge’s continued growth (and skyrocketing valuation) stem from its [expansion](https://www.techtarget.com/revcyclemanagement/news/366626555/Gen-AI-company-Abridge-raises-300M-targets-revenue-cycle) into additional hospital workflows including revenue cycle management (RCM), billing, and coding.

Meanwhile, AI-native medical search tool [OpenEvidence](https://www.openevidence.com) has become the [fastest platform](https://www.biospace.com/press-releases/openevidence-achieves-1-billion-valuation-in-sequoia-led-round-and-announces-content-partnership-with-the-new-england-journal-of-medicine#:~:text=Launched%20in%202023%2C%20OpenEvidence%20became,users%20in%20the%20United%20States.) to surpass 100K clinician users. With trusted brand [roots](https://www.mobihealthnews.com/news/medical-information-platform-openevidence-reaches-1b-valuation) and [smart](https://media.jamanetwork.com/announcement/openevidence-and-the-jama-network-sign-strategic-content-agreement/?utm_campaign=health_tech&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9Hb1Qa4wDkQ49KQxe3EojxE6g-NUAszP3NeVlm1tP_spIOeETi3z6qibFrqh3DVdIKykWLwVMErXPJa2kDchPSwiSPXg&_hsmi=365134772&utm_content=365134772&utm_source=hs_email) [partnerships](https://www.openevidence.com/announcements/openevidence-and-nejm), they’re adding more than 50K doctors monthly. Physicians find OpenEvidence’s chatGPT-style query interface intuitive and conversational, and the output [fast](https://www.forbes.com/sites/spencerdorn/2024/12/13/how-ai-is-changing-how-doctors-access-medical-knowledge/), [clear](https://www.healio.com/news/rheumatology/20250522/openevidence-ai-tool-lowers-the-barrier-to-vast-collection-of-evidencebased-data#:~:text=Four%20independent%20physicians%20used%20a,support%2C%20and%203.6%20for%20satisfaction.), and [clinically relevant](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12033599/).

Together, OpenEvidence and Abridge show that breakout growth is possible with the right mix of provider trust, intuitive and impactful products, and capital to scale. [Ambient](https://news.microsoft.com/source/2025/03/03/microsoft-dragon-copilot-provides-the-healthcare-industrys-first-unified-voice-ai-assistant-that-enables-clinicians-to-streamline-clinical-documentation-surface-information-and-automate-task/) [documentation](https://www.statnews.com/2025/06/17/nabla-raises-70-million-ambient-market-heats-up/?utm_campaign=health_tech&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--CTIUd0h_wGTLQ6CnJwwqzKCWQOkkaIL2pKe90j3NmA_Uh758sEQbeh09CCXLM7V1bEkvtY-19l1x_kOdbtHkcMw5Mkg&_hsmi=367121070&utm_content=367121070&utm_source=hs_email) and provider [workflow](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/ai-and-machine-learning/epic-introduces-launchpad-fuel-faster-generative-ai-adoption-among) [tooling](https://hitconsultant.net/2025/03/04/microsoft-and-wolters-kluwer-health-integrate-uptodate-into-microsoft-copilot-studio/) are fiercely competitive and increasingly saturated markets. But with most AI deployments [stuck](https://medcitynews.com/2025/03/ai-digital-healthcare-hospital/) in pilot phases (and real-world [performance](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/ai-and-machine-learning/duke-proposes-evaluation-framework-ai-scribes-vc-dollars-pour?utm_medium=email&utm_source=nl&utm_campaign=HC-NL-FierceHealthTech&oly_enc_id=3435B6627690J4X) benchmarks still in [early](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/ai-and-machine-learning/chai-collaborators-open-shop-validate-algorithms-marking-pivot-point-health) [innings](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/ai-and-machine-learning/openai-pushes-further-healthcare-release-healthbench-evaluate-ai-models)), there’s still plenty of room for new applications to [grow](https://www.bvp.com/atlas/the-healthcare-ai-adoption-index).

*“Currently, only a third of AI pilots successfully scale to full system-wide deployment. To improve those odds, vendors need to earn customer trust, which requires highly secure, accurate, easy-to-use tools. It’s also equally important for pilots to demonstrate consistent end-user engagement or an easy-to-measure ROI. Make it a no-brainer for health systems to adopt.”

## Exits and the future of tech-enabled care delivery

Seeing venture funding propel growth and impact is exciting. What’s also exciting? Exits. Undeniably, the breakout moments of 2025 so far go to tech-enabled care delivery businesses [Hinge Health](https://www.hingehealth.com/) and [Omada Health](https://www.omadahealth.com/).6 Breaking the recent hiatus in IPOs (just two digital health public exits in the past three years), digital physical therapy platform Hinge Health [launched](https://www.mobihealthnews.com/news/hinge-health-goes-public-raises-4373m-ipo) on the NYSE in May, and virtual chronic care provider Omada Health [on the](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/digital-health/omada-health-files-go-public-digital-health-industry-waits-ipo-revival?utm_medium=email&utm_source=nl&utm_campaign=HC-NL-FierceHealthTech&oly_enc_id=3435B6627690J4X) Nasdaq in June.

Just as AI-native tools are delivering on the promise of digital health in provider contexts, tech-enabled services companies are realizing transformed, sustainable care delivery.
