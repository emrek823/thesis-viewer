**Client**
Thanks a lot for making the time. I'm trying to understand more about the ambient scribe category. I see that at Mayo, you guys are pilot or a customer of both Ambience and Abridge. Is that right?

**Expert**
That's correct, yes, for over a year and a half now.

**Client**
Of both?

**Expert**
Correct.

**Client**
Great. It'd be great to first understand more about how Mayo's using these tools today. Is there a split between specialties or departments where each tool is being used and how those pilot programs have gone so far?

**Expert**
Sure. If we start with Ambience, that was the original one that was in prior to Abridge. Prior to 2024, they had already had relationships and also partnerships in terms of primarily in the family practice, internal medicine settings. It wasn't until Abridge later came on and then took that pilot over for other certain areas. Since then, I would say the practice areas have also been that internal medicine focus. It has not been a requirement. As of last year, there were over 700 physicians.

This is all out there. 700 physicians out there. They with licenses, actively using the platform. They have ambitious plans, even for this year, that number has gone up quite a bit to even extend that to not just the health system side, but also the other, what they call destination medical centers, which are the other campuses in Arizona, Phoenix, as well as Florida.

**Client**
Got it. That's for both Ambience and Abridge. Is that right?

**Expert**
The extension has primarily been on the Abridge side. I would say that one's gaining more traction, although you're not uprooting or replacing the folks already on Ambience.

**Client**
Got it. Where are you seeing more adoption today among the physicians between Ambience and Abridge for the primary Mayo campus?

**Expert**
Can you repeat that question?

**Client**
Where are you seeing the most adoption? Which tool is getting more adoption between Ambience and Abridge among the physicians on the main Mayo campus?

**Expert**
On the main and Rochester, that would be Abridge. To be more specific, also, there are collaborations. I can't go in depth about it besides high-level, but in terms of not only extending the physician scribing module, but also, I don't know what they call it, but it's basically the module for nursing documentation.

Just given that originally, these kind of tools, you have to understand that they were to alleviate physician burden, closing encounters, document their patients' activity, also just better bedside manner. As a product tool, they are also realizing that over half a patient stay is done by nursing and traditional nursing flow sheets into EHRs. They also have a similar technology, but more focused on the nursing perspective.

**Client**
Makes sense to me. Could you quantify the adoption so far? How many seats do you think Abridge has and how many seats do you think Ambience has?

**Expert**
I would say, right now, I know for sure that Mayo has over 5,000 licenses for Abridge and the Ambience number is much smaller, I would say less than half of that.

**Client**
Got it. Do you know why that is?

**Expert**
I would say this, that I observe there's more of a trend or a push to adopt those from Abridge. However, it's hard to uproot an existing system that's already in there, such as Ambience, until that full evaluation is done. I would say the other reason would be sometimes it is a strategic move in terms of having more than one player, especially at a large organization.

Not only does it help vendor management, but also in the case if there is anything I'd say wrong with one vendor, you could easily switch out of another. A great example in another upcycle space is obviously the Change Healthcare incident from last February where the hospital systems that were positioned in a way to have more than one in one space were better able to get back on their feet. I think that's also the case here, which is not uncommon.

**Client**
What's the underlying reason that Abridge is being pushed more? Is it because of physician satisfaction? Is it because of some feature or functionality? Is the Abridge product just better?

**Expert**
I speak from a revenue cycle finance perspective. We are more supporting cast members, but a lot of these decisions on what to adopt, how to adopt, where to adopt are all driven by the clinical team. What I hear is they are more in tune and they're more satisfied with the tools from Abridge and they see more promise. From a EHR integration, I would say they're both very comparable. They both offer features and then even from the standpoint of Epic strategic partnerships, Epic has these preferred partners, and both of them are preferred partners. I think it's mainly a clinical decision.

**Client**
Got it. On the revenue cycle side, have you seen any of the coding functionality from either of the tools?

**Expert**
We are not, but we are seeing more accurate results of their coding. With these tools, by nature, I would say there's improved charge capture in terms of the sense of more clinicals are being documented where the coders can code from. As a result, we are seeing more accurate coding as we compare them against standard benchmarks on E&M levels and other factors. As a result, we're also seeing decreased charge lag, meaning the closed encounters and then increase in reimbursement as well, and less denials.

**Client**
That is coming from both tools or just one?

**Expert**
I would say they're coming from both tools, but we see it more with Abridge because of the default of there's more users using it.

**Client**
How are you quantifying that uplift? How big is that?

**Expert**
It's not very big, but we have seen it already because it's noticeable, I would say those charges in those areas for what we see right now, which is a very small population of folks, there are over 30,000 providers. At a large organization like ours, we only have not even 10% of folks on it, but I would say that it is at least a 15%-20% improvement.

**Client**
That's very large.

**Expert**
Yeah, it's very large.

**Client**
I assume that's multiple seven figures, just ballparking it?

**Expert**
Yes, I would say that.

**Client**
Got it. Can I ask one follow-up? This is super helpful. In terms of the uplift, you said that you see it more from Abridge because there are more folks using Abridge. Have you looked at the uplift for someone using Abridge versus the uplift for one person using Ambience for one to see if one is better or no?

**Expert**
We haven't looked at that. There is not necessarily a team that has done that kind of analysis.

**Client**
Got it. A follow-up question, when you all bought the product, would the coding coming with the base product?

**Expert**
No, not at that time. I think right now, they do have some sort of coding functionality as well, or suggestive coding, which actually makes sense. To answer your question, no, it was not bundled at the time and we're not using that.

**Client**
Would love to hear more about why you are not engaging with the coding suggestion tools today.

**Expert**
The reason why is we have existing workflows from other vendors taking that kind of workflow. Coders are still having their own traditional tools to code, but the Ambience scribing is just exactly what it is. It's just describing and documentation in the patient chart and then that flows into the overall coding workflow where our coding teams are coding from.

**Client**
Would you want to eventually replace that?

**Expert**
I don't see that happening anytime soon. I would say the structure of not only the FTEs, but also the tools that are being used by them are pretty intact. I would say it's possible. If this recommendation was for a new provider, that may be a possibility, but in terms of large systems with existing tools that are extremely sticky, it would be very hard to replace or even get into that.

**Client**
Got it. What are these tools?

**Expert**
You could think of the traditional tools, the Optums, 3Ms.. so not only the reference tools, but also diagnosis coding, but also the hierarchy. We also have a combination of certain subsets with autonomous coding tools as well.

**Client**
What are those?

**Expert**
There's various specialty coding tools for the service lines for ED, rad onc, also pathology.

**Client**
Got it. What are the names of the tools for each?

**Expert**
I'm not going to share that information, but there's plenty of vendors out there.

**Client**
Got it. If you did see a meaningful product to come out of Ambience or Abridge, how difficult would it be to make that replacement?

**Expert**
It would be extremely hard. I would say the chances are one out of 10. If there is any meaningful introduction of their new tools or if they're trying to expand their product line, if I understand your question correctly, there's possibilities that they could pilot certain things. That's not unreasonable. I would say from a strategic advantage, they have one.

If you're talking about Ambience or Abridge, because they are controlling the documentation, they are more ahead as opposed to the other way around. In terms of replacing existing workflows, where organizations are paying millions and millions of dollars for that. I don't see that happening anytime soon, but maybe on a pilot basis that's possible.

**Client**
Got it. I'm sure you see the advantage in having the coding tool also being the scribe tool, just being at the point of care. Is that a clear advantage to you?

**Expert**
I do see that as a clear advantage to be more upfront in the rev cycle. By nature of them already capturing that documentation, it makes very natural sense that they would go downstream and then provide that coding assistance. Again, if it's a brand-new system, I could understand, but if it's already a system that already has their existing workflows, their existing coders, having that introduction would be extremely difficult. It just might take time.

**Client**
Have you demoed the Ambience, Abridge coding suggestion tools yet?

**Expert**
I have seen it, yes.

**Client**
Do you think they're effective at all?

**Expert**
I think they are. They're great. It's just, I would say you have to think about it, Abridge for certain I would say tertiary quaternary, very complex, high care areas. Right now, if you think about it, they're only being used in the internal medicine space. However, coding workflows, you don't have them just family practice.

You have them by nature set up by inpatient, outpatient, surgical for all service lines, so for them to be able to suggest codes, you're only suggesting codes for those that you're using, which is family practice is just one little piece of a large health system. Now, if you are a family practice or internal medicine organization, that may make entire sense to code and to help your areas, but in areas where they're not using it, that remains a gap. Does that make sense?

**Client**
Yeah.

**Expert**
Someone has to code your radiology, your lab, your ED, your orthopedic, your surgical, your colonoscopies, etc. If you're not using that, then you're only taking one slice of a small pie.

**Client**
Do you know why Ambience or Abridge haven't moved into other specialties as well?

**Expert**
In my mind, it's an engineering problem, I think, at some point. I say that because if you think about what you're using right now, the traditional sense on the inpatient, whether you go to your doctor's office for your annual wellness visit, it is a very controlled environment. There is not only a limited subset of codes, E&M codes, there is basically one provider talking to you.

The other specialties might have multiple people coming in and out on an inpatient stay. Imagine a patient is in there for seven days. You are going to have multi specialties giving that person different things. Having that charted in the right place in the EHR, I think is still an issue. Eventually, they are now going into certain other rooms, such as, say, the ortho or surgical space. They could bypass the small coffee talk. They have small ways of doing that.

I think just the nature of healthcare and then how you are putting information in the chart, it still remains problematic until that's figured out. I think that's why it has not expanded to its limited scope. I would say the largest organizations, even the one I am currently in, you are taking a very cautious approach in getting the small ones right in your pilot areas before you roll it out.

**Client**
That makes sense to me. That's a little bit distinct from other places like the way Mayo works where you have this full approach where you might move patients around different departments and different specialties.

**Expert**
Different departments, different specialties. Let's just say you're in an inpatient's head, that you're going to have labs run, you're going to have radiology, you might have someone doing an EKG, you might have someone do a bedside procedure. If all those people are not on your system, how are they going to log into your system and then dictate their notes?

I don't think we're there yet. I do see a day, or maybe they could just one day click a button and log in. They could document their notes in there, but that still remains a problem in the flow, especially when you have multiple people touching them and then different parts of that dictation, if we're talking about dictation, needs to be documented in a different way.

**Client**
Got it. Last thing, I'll pass it to my colleagues. Do you think in the potential expansion into other specialties, does Abridge have the advantage there or does Ambience also have a fair shot at piloting as well?

**Expert**
I think they both have. I'm not a technologist, but I think they both have a foothold. They're both good companies. There's also other smaller companies out there too. This technology, just like your Google Search or your ChatGPT, it's not just the one. There's Suki, there's DeepScribe. There's a few others out there. I would say there's room in this market for different players. Is this for a client or is this for just your general understanding of the market?

**Client**
Yeah, just general understanding.

**Expert**
I would just say there's multiple areas where these folks could expand to. Providers however, they do want to find some of those key criteria. It's almost like a chicken and egg situation where you want to go with the one that has a track record of already large clients or organizations of your similar size and scope. I think that will be the challenge for these companies as they continue to grow and expand. I do think there's room in the market for different scenarios and different solutions.

**Client**
Makes a lot of sense to me. Curious to hear your thoughts on one of the things that you mentioned around some of the improvements on the coding side. Given the better notes that's getting taken, have you considered what the compliance implication of that is?

**Expert**
Can you clarify that question?

**Client**
Yeah. An ROI calculation for having a tool that can better capture the codes. Is compliance a priority for you?

**Expert**
Compliance is always a priority. I would say in the sense of how we track that in revenue, we look at not only their standard bell curves in terms of E&M levels by site, by area, and then we could generally track that versus competitors. If your 60% or 70%, supposed to be doing a Level three or Level four or Level five, we track that and then in terms of making sure we're not over or under coding, and then we can even track that by provider and then if there are reasons for that, we do investigate.

Also on the compliance front, if I understand your question correctly, if it's terms of paybacks or compliance requests where we are over coding, that is generally called out as well. We have teams, organizations usually have teams, a robust team of whether they're in revenue integrity or provider education, that we give that feedback back to providers. I think that's a long-winded answer to answer your question. Does that help?

**Client**
It's super helpful. How do you currently track? How do you currently check for overcoding? Is it a manual process?

**Expert**
Yeah, we have dashboards and analytics. For example, right now, what I mean is there's analytics right now on a weekly monthly basis, not only tracking new provider education, but also tracking those that are essentially outliers from a physician standpoint, all the way down to their clinic and location level, their suggested evaluation and management codes. These are the 992 levels.

Anything that's outside of that, that's called out. Sometimes they're very justifiable, but that is brought to the physician's attention. From a large health system, they do this. They could also do this at a small community hospital or small practice as well. That's one way where they're measured against not only their site, other organization, but also measured against their peers as well.

**Client**
Just on that piece, real quick, I was just going to ask, have you seen that either Ambience and Abridge, the type of documentation they're producing lends itself to overcoding or undercoding?

**Expert**
I would say it's only as good as the rules you put in. They have their language models and as they're ramping up, they could take I think that's suggested as even 18 months of data. Sometimes an organization doesn't have that much to put in to make it smarter. They're going to learn from their old patterns and then they're going to understand where there's opportunity or where it is overcoding and then they'll adjust their models as necessary. It's going to look different from the day organization goes live versus six months later when they have more data. I think that's just an evolving conversation.

**Client**
Has it been a problem with Abridge or Ambience noticeably between the two?

**Expert**
Not that I know of, no. If anything, it's only called out anything that's overcoding, if anything, we've seen too many that are undercoded, at least in our organization. That could be stemming from a variety of reasons as well.

**Client**
Given that, would it be interesting to adopt a coding tool that can help better capture the codes at the right level? I think maybe one of the things we've heard about having a coding tool is it can suggest. That's integrated with the AI scribe is it can suggest codes and missing information that will be required for codes in real-time during the patient visit. Things of that nature. Would that be interesting?

**Expert**
It would be interesting, yes. I would just say that for some organizations, I would say that's a value add, but I would also say that other organizations, there's other ways to go about that as well. Whether you're using a claim scrubber, you could get that same thing. You could also do a CDI tool that could help you look at this information. No one has a perfect playbook of how you want to do your rev cycle, but I would just say that the best organizations are going to find out and make sure whether you're using that suggestive coding or you're using some sort of auditing tool afterwards, that those charges are captured accurately and compliantly.

**Client**
A tough one as it relates to that, what's your view on coding tools like CodaMetrix or Nim or Fathom?

**Expert**
Those all ring a bell. Very familiar with all of those. I would say that's where I was alluding to. The SmarterDX is a great example where they could do the same thing, but it's more of an after coding to make sure with predictive analytics that your DRG levels for your inpatient care, that they are coded at the right level. They also have a predictive denials tool as well that could help with that. Suki, Nim, Fathom, SmarterDX do something very similar to that, but more from an auditing perspective as opposed to the suggestive scenario that you just described.

**Client**
Based on what you just said, it doesn't seem like you see a necessity of combining the coding tool with the GI scribe tool.

**Expert**
The SmarterDX one, for example, they could do all your inpatient accounts or all the inpatient types of cases. Until the scribes are doing all your cases, and it's not just limited to a small subset. That's why I say that it's a nice feature to have, but I would say there are other more holistic approaches and different ways of doing it.

**Client**
Super helpful. I think that's all on my end. Just going back to one of the things that you mentioned on the 15%-20% improvement in coding results and reimbursement levels once you introduce the scribe tools, is that your concrete financial ROI that you think about and why you continue to buy these scribing tools? How are you thinking about the hard ROI here?

**Expert**
I would say the basis for some of these, it's just the cost of doing business. It's not really a requirement like we're trying to meet this threshold and on a hindsight analysis, if we're not, we're going to get rid of them. I would say the largest organizations that are in a good financial position, they're looking for these kind of tools. I would say it's not grounded in a super requirement. We do do hindsight analysis and we are already seeing that improvement. Seeing that improvement, you'll say, "So what's next?" Will just help accelerate the decisions to roll that out even more. That will just basically mean more dollars for these tools that we're going to spend on an annual basis.

**Client**
Got it. It's not that doctors love this. It's saving them time and that's enough to roll it out across all the organization. It needs to be correlated with these improvement on coding and reimbursement? I don't understand what would make you renew check the box.

**Expert**
First of all to get it through, usually they're physician champions and that was the basis for all these tools to reduce that administrative burden by physicians. That has been accomplished already. I wouldn't say it's as long as that's happy they could dictate of how they want to spend it. We are also seeing the downstream effects of that higher reimbursement which just helps the case to extend it.

**Client**
Got it. The idea that clinicians love it is enough for you all to buy a product like this and continue to buy it over time?

**Expert**
Yes. Just like they have other clinical systems that help them with helping with their patient care. As long as there's some baseline numbers that it helps with their patient care, they're generating the revenue. We're getting reimbursement for it. There's EHR integration. A lot of these things are very supported by the organization.

**Client**
Got it. A couple of the comments you mentioned about where Ambience and Abridge play as it relates to where they're well-suited is I think you hear murmurs from them being able to go into areas much broader than that. When's the last time that you all evaluated the products for outside of internal medicine and family practice that you talked about? I think that they have a vision of being able to do everything. How do you know when they're at that point? How do you think about that where you would put it into different areas?

**Expert**
I would say there's different teams involved in committees, and they're just brought up at different circles within the clinical departments on their interests. We do this with those partners in terms of asking them. We have monthly touch bases with them, and then we take that and we introduce it. It's not a requirement nor is it pushed on physicians. Usually that has to be physician-led in terms of if I'm in gastroenterology or if I'm in dermatology or whoever. Usually they have their practice and service lines meetings or some of these suggestions are brought up and then that's where they're vetted out.

**Client**
Got it. I feel like when you talk to them, it feels like they're able to do a lot broader specialties than that. I was curious if it's just because the clinicians in the other areas don't want it, or if it's the products are not, in your opinion, ready to be used in those settings.

**Expert**
Can you repeat that again?

**Client**
I was curious if you feel like the products of Ambience and Abridge are not suited or Ambience as you talk to other organizations, they're in different specialties, is it because the clinicians here are not asking for the product that it's not going into these other areas within the health system? Is it because you all don't believe that the product is suitable or ready or good enough? That was what I was trying to understand. I feel like there's like the desire piece and then there's the product capabilities.

**Expert**
Yeah, I think there's both of that. That's an ongoing conversation. They have leadership discussions with different areas of not only the clinical teams, but also the administrative teams. That's being discussed. Whether or not it's feasible, whether even physicians want it. I can't really comment on that.

**Client**
Awesome. Thanks so much for this. Have a good one. Bye.
