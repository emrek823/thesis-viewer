RightSite Health

Eligible, capture, success rates

Patients call EMS, EMS rolls ambulance, show up on scene with protocol driven assessment. EMS determines behavior change or not

EMS makes decision whether or not to call us → at the house, on seen, do exam, with patient

Criteria for avoidable EMS visits. Won’t call us or defer

Eligible -

Sales process to EMS to engage them. They don’t need to sign a contract. Not requiring to

1 EMS agency in communities that we’re in -

Dallas - might be a few

ATL - 2 big counties → 1, Cobb -> 1, Gwynnet

120K 911 calls

50% are candidates

Match our service to EMS, we will be a tool for all of their patients

Only jumping on a call and getting insurance if in-home EMS has determined that it’s non-emergent

Capture - telehealth assesmment on all of the calls and generate claim for 205 regardless of whether they go to the ER

IF the patient, once they’ve had telehealth visit with person and they’d rather be navigated to RightSite

Success - decision made by patient. Releasing EMS, going to see provider that isnt’ ER, treated and end up back home

This i

ET3 model

Incentive experiment for CMMI - good news is that they neeed to realign the incentives

Bad news - they had also required that people are participating, find out where to take them, how to get them there. Go figure it out, pay you not to take them to the ER

Workflow

Smartphones and iPad. Start zoom call

Question with medic

Patient consent

EMS makes decision to call us

Incentives

Liability

Managment

Bosses need them to do this b/c staffing issues, trucks stuck at hospital

Good news for us. Protocol driven animals. Sets the step by step process on what they do, what they report, watching how often people do this

EMTALA - once it crosses over the campus of the hospital

ER or hospital or psych facility and they don’t get

Revenue

Out of network, bill charge, collection rate is 10%

Economic proposition

Medics

Straightforward

Why does medic want to make this call?

Fire - do you want to wait at hospital. Rather be back at fire station

For-profit

Plans

Retail - plans 1x1

Credentialed FFS rates

Wholesale - avoidable ED and embed service model into RFPs. Avoidable ED guru

TX - if you’re ambulance provider and you want to take them somewhere else, we’ll pay you. Ambulance providers says thanks a lot but Im not putting my patient into

Paying EMS for taking on emergent

Navigators

See availability at urgent care centers

Lay navigators - exact model used at TAV

Sound assumptions for that too - currently at 5 but a lot of capacity right now. 215 calls / month / navigator.

Physicians

Those are not full-time hires. Current physician and CMO. Acts as physician and CMO. His time as physician goes down over time as we bring in new docs (part-time?)

Burnt out tired of working at ED - 30 hours or 40 hours / week

Time

20 min for EMS release From the time EMS calls until the patient makes a decision to go with Right Site

During that 20 min period, telehealth assesment, conversation with patient and introduction to navigator

20+ min - navigator and patient for logistics

40 min for navigator

JAX / FL

Fire chief and EMS chief and city mgr have come to table

Just like Atlanta - response times are shit, all the same

Dominant health plan - Florida Blues. Relationship in JAX has plan president coming to the table

Friendly known EMS entity with dominant health plans we know we can get to

Retail - We’re already navigating your members, get on board

Get us in as telehealth doctor

ATL and Cobb Fire

* 50% * 20% =

Another situation in Jersey

We’re a hospital and want to work with ACO

Gainshare

50% gainshare - that’s what Landmark got. The advisor says we get 50% - here is why you should ask for 50%

Plan has to do nothing

Guaranteeing it

Compared to Landmark, clean attribution

Plan pushback

Plan knows they’ve got X number of ED visits

Ability for them to say if I can do this for no cost and you hit 3% or 10% (whatever low number you want). That’s fine if they

Pretty easy to model

Why has this model not been executed

Dispatch - source of volume for them and catch them after an event (ED, let us come into your home)

Inside the 911 episode - Tele911, MDAlly

Their approach is different in 2 respects

Not using extender and only using board certified EM physicians

None of them have SDoH lens and taht’s our foundataionl lens. It’s SDoH problem and we bring physician along for the ride

SDoH

Calling ED b/c they can’t access the system

Oringiating the data - we own it

Big successful company and all the plans own  the data

Plan taking action

Nuggets of information to fill

TAV vs. RSH

TAV - staying forever

transporatoin , nvagiation of HC system, admin (paperowrk in ENGLISH), health literacy

Outbound

Root cause for 911 use
