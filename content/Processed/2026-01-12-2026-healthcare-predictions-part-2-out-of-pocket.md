## We ain’t out of office anymore!!!

Last week I talked about some predictions I had for 2026. Many of you replied saying “OOO – I’m traveling until 1 / 5”. To those people I say…enjoy my schedule send emails coming in hot at 8AM.

But the rest of you are like me - thinking about healthcare on New Year’s even, using the countdown to think about my deductible resetting. Those people sent in some of their 2026 predictions.

My favorites below, memes and comments from me.

## Direct contracts in response to the uninsured rate

“As the uninsured rate climbs (as a result of HR1 and the expiration of enhanced subsidies), hospitals will likely see a spike in bad debt and collections burdens. Paired with the rise of high-deductible plans, this creates a nightmare-like scenario for providers on the collections front. At the same time, employers are pushing for favorable deals through direct contracting (a notable effort is [Cost Plus Wellness](https://www.costpluswellness.com/), a network built by Mark Cuban’s Cost Plus company).

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/611ed5a217b32b056e5477ec/695bde9f6282cdecd166379f_294b58a5.png)

[*Source*](https://www.costpluswellness.com/)*: Pretty interesting, you can actually see a lot of their contracted terms*

Offering lower rates may seem like a loss for providers, but there are elements of direct contracts that can benefit them, such as 0% cost-sharing and deductible carve-outs. Community hospitals and small health systems may start entertaining these arrangements more seriously; negotiating a direct contract with a large local employer can create guarantees around volume and price that provide greater certainty. Large health systems may not play ball with aggressively priced direct contracts, but negotiating carve-outs (on deductibles, etc.) and renegotiating contract terms will certainly be on the table.”

‍**[NK note: I’ve been hearing “direct contracting is about to take off” for as long as I’ve heard “Hudson Yards is about to pop off”. All of the arguments seem logical especially around collections, but I just don’t think employers want to take on that burden. I was at a self-funding conference last year where someone talked about this - and it’s basically someone’s full time job to manage these contracts.**

**But hey…maybe 2026 is actually the year for Hudson Yards.]**

## The Medicare Advantage Prior Auth Experience Arrives in Traditional Medicare

“As CMS progresses towards ubiquitous value-based care in Medicare, the core vehicles are MA and CMMI pilot programs operating in Medicare FFS. Historically, CMMI programs introduced VBC features, e.g. risk adjustment, quality measurement and prospective capitation. These incentives are operationalized *behind the scenes* as EHR alerts and care gap spreadsheets. Patients only notice rising prices and the harried look of clinicians.

In 2026, CMMI’s [WISeR model](https://www.cms.gov/priorities/innovation/innovation-models/wiser) revises Medicare FFS’s minimally invasive prior authorization program. It kicks off a five year bake-off where prior authorization vendors (many already servicing commercial insurers) conduct prior auth for a *limited set of services in limited geographies.* The scope of the program today focuses on FFS fraud hot-spots (think $10B in skin grafts) which were largely [averted in MA due to prior auth programs](https://oig.hhs.gov/reports/all/2025/medicare-part-b-payment-trends-for-skin-substitutes-raise-major-concerns-about-fraud-waste-and-abuse/). Importantly, [CMMI explicitly states](https://www.morganlewis.com/pubs/2025/07/cms-is-getting-wiser-about-medicare-waste-but-at-what-cost-to-providers) it can expand the geographic scope and / or service categories of the program with each assessment of its effectiveness. Since *effectiveness = spend reduction* and the same processes are well-tested in MA, *the space of providers with effective “gold cards” will probably go down over time*.

Back to the patient UX which varies dramatically across MA and FFS. A [KFF study](https://www.kff.org/medicare/nearly-50-million-prior-authorization-requests-were-sent-to-medicare-advantage-insurers-in-2023/) of 2023 period estimates 1.8 PA determinations per MA enrollee vs. 0.1 in FFS. In 2026, a much wider swath of FFS beneficiaries will be exposed to the workflow below.

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/611ed5a217b32b056e5477ec/695bde9f6282cdecd16637a8_ae535bff.png)

[*Source*](https://www.cms.gov/priorities/innovation/files/wiser-provider-supplier-guide.pdf)*: Pg 4 of model spec. In MA, these steps throttle a lot of spend*

Not pictured is the anxious patient or caregiver who unclogs the process by:

1. Calling all three parties involved
2. Learning someone is pointing at someone else
3. Consulting GPT / friend who works in healthcare
4. Resolving the confusion
5. Service is denied anyway
6. Commences next iteration of workflow

To be fair to CMS and insurers, *this is a super hard problem*. A balanced program which averts fraud without driving clinicians and patients crazy remains elusive. My sense is FFS patients are not going to be enthused though.

To learn more, I recommend [Sidney Menack’s write up](https://www.morganlewis.com/pubs/2025/07/cms-is-getting-wiser-about-medicare-waste-but-at-what-cost-to-providers) and [the CRS Report](https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/IF13133) as starting points.”

**[NK note: I feel like one of the big reasons that people who turn 65 choose traditional Medicare is to be able to see any doctor they want and not deal with utilization management runarounds like prior authorization. I wonder if this is actually going to change how older people make the decision between them - or if the scope is still too small for it to matter since it’s only a handful of specific a shortlist of procedures it applies to.**

## GLP-1s - the king stays king

“Predictions for GLP1 (in weight loss) we can look back and verify somewhat:

> 50% of patients starting GLP1s under insurance in 2026 will be enrolled with a lifestyle program. And > 50% of patients starting a GLP1 in 2026 will be cash pay DTC.

Employers want to restrict GLP1s (via peterson institute, [Dec 2025](https://phti.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/12/PHTI-Employer-Approaches-to-GLP-1-Coverage-Market-Trend-Report.pdf)) because, you know, they like money (patient persistence also growing). The easiest (morally and feasibility) is just require a lifestyle intervention + GLP1 with evidence of ongoing benefit. CMS has signaled a similar strategy offering lifestyle interventions with [GLP1 coverage](https://www.cms.gov/priorities/innovation/innovation-models/balance)

[*Source: Brown & Brown*](https://www.bbrown.com/us/insight/state-of-glp-1-medication-coverage-for-weight-loss-employer-survey-results/)

10% of wegovy, 30% of zepbound is cash pay [right now](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/pills-tiktok-weight-loss-apps-consumer-driven-future-glp-1s-2025-12-29/). Now imagine there's an oral Wegovy (approved) and an oral GLP-1 (orfoglipron) - 150/month on < 200/month through Novo [direct](https://www.wegovy.com/about-wegovy/the-wegovy-pill.html)/[TrumpRx](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/11/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-announces-major-developments-in-bringing-most-favored-nation-pricing-to-american-patients/) for pretty much a maintenance dose of the medication.

And all the nonsense with compounding pharmacies? Yea, They're cooked According to Novo, 1 million patients are on compounded GLPs but imo this could be < 200k by EOY as customers realize it's the [same price](https://www.hims.com/weight-loss/drug-pricing) from Lilly/Novo. HIMS is not Him.

Putting these together, I will make the same prediction I made before: the king stays the king. A few new mechanisms (Amylin, triple G (is that a wrestler?), myostatin (to get f\*\*\*ing jacked), INHBE for longer dosing, etc). Amylin is the only one with a chance because of better tolerability. Tirzepatide is the King: the solution is GLP1/GIP + lifestyle + Lower dose/Oral for maintenance.

Side note: LLY will likely outspend the NIH next year for their focus Areas (Cardiometabolic, immunology, Neuro, Onc)”

* [Adu Subramanian](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adu-subramanian/)

**[NK note: HIMS is not him is a bar. That’s all.**

**One issue if 50% of GLP-1 users are actually cash pay is that this is going to be a nightmare for anyone that relies on pharmacy claims data to do anything. Plus I feel like we’re actually missing out on some interesting analyses on whether patients are seeing improvements in other disease areas]**

*I get some interesting messages on the* [*OOP instagram*](https://www.instagram.com/outofpockethealth/?hl=en)*, here’s one on someone getting off their biologic by using compounded retatrutide*

## The Medicaid doom loop increases government dependence

“HR1's Medicaid cuts will ironically make healthcare MORE dependent on government payments, not less.

When you cut Medicaid payments, already-distressed hospitals close first. They're running on thin margins and can't absorb the revenue loss. Loss-leading service lines (pediatrics, OB, behavioral health, etc.) shut down first.

But Medicaid patients don't vanish. They concentrate at the remaining providers - typically large academic medical centers AMCs that can't refuse them (EMTALA, mission, political leverage).

This creates a doom loop: The survivors see their Medicaid payer mix increase just as per-patient revenue decreases. They become MORE dependent on supplemental paymen
