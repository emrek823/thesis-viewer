# Healthtech Investment Trends in 2025

Healthtech is attracting a bigger share of venture capital (VC) investment in 2025 than ever before. Investment in provider operations is driving the surge. So far this year, **$5.5B** has been invested in activities that support the delivery of healthcare, such as scheduling, documentation, and billing. That puts provider ops well on track to surpass its 2021 record of **$7.8B**.

To be more specific, AI in provider operations is drawing a crowd. AI companies didn’t just rack up a few more healthtech deals and a bigger percentage of dollars this year — their share has leaped nearly **60%** since 2024. Valuations are climbing, but deals are also getting bigger. Among healthtech mega-deals this year, AI-enabled provider operations swept up **73%** of the total.

Healthtech has historically been focused on clinical care, dominated by alternative care models such as telehealth and care management. Now there’s a new focus on front- and back-office administrative tools, and alternative care makes up less than **10%** of total sector investment.

The biggest opportunities for AI in healthcare right now are solving business problems, not medical care problems. Using AI to alleviate inefficiencies and business friction is freeing up time for more critical things, like caring for patients.

That isn’t to say that over time, AI won’t be a transformative part of healthcare across the board. AI is developing into an integral part of the medical toolkit. Many changes appear set to stay and expand across alternative care, analytics, non-invasive monitoring, imaging, and surgical tools.

While the expanded investment into new areas of healthtech is encouraging to see, sometimes these increases don’t align with the demands of the venture economy. Many of the biggest deals are tapping into larger investment firms that aren’t traditionally involved in healthcare. Inflated premiums can contribute to a bigger and bigger investment bubble — time will tell how the market responds to this runup.

Healthcare is a tricky business at the best of times. It requires a deep understanding of the nuances of everything from clinical specialties to billing, workflows, purchasing processes, and regulations. The timelines for successful investments are long, and the rule book is ever-changing. Partnering with trusted advisors who have sector battle scars and offer sage advice can help prudent companies scale for both today and tomorrow.

# Administrative AI is driving healthtech

| **Investment Trends** | **Details** |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| Consolidation through M&#x26;A has become the most realistic exit. |  |
| 2025 is already the best year for provider operations investment since 2021. If activity stays consistent, 2025 will be the biggest year for provider ops ever. |  |
| Healthtech is now definitively an administrative sector, not a clinical one. |  |
| In 2021, alternative care was 42% of healthtech investment dollars. Today, it’s down to 9%. |  |
| Provider operations was 19% of investment four years ago; now it’s 44%. |  |
| There’s no question: The AI boom has been good to provider operations. |  |
| Strategic investors like UnitedHealth Group, Boston Scientific and CVS — along with private equity (PE) — have stepped in as liquidity providers, especially through roll-ups and platform building. |  |
| Meanwhile, recent IPOs are showing real strength. Tempus and Hinge Health showed that strong companies with solid fundamentals have a lot of appeal to public markets. |  |
| But even Omada is looking better as the bottom line improves. |  |
| Not every company that emerged during the dot-com boom was Webvan or Flooz.com. Some AI applications are noise, but some of them are very real. |  |
| Infrastructure companies or those tackling long-standing problem areas like revenue cycle are the best bets to stick around. |  |

## Seed and Series A AI valuations are bigger than the 2021 boom.

| **Valuation Trends** | **Details** |
|----------------------|-------------|
| Valuations for AI companies are growing across the board, but the bubble is worse for seed and Series A companies. |  |
| Median valuations in the early-stage have blown past the previous highs of 2021. |  |
| Massive growth in buzzy early-stage tech is what you’d expect to see in an investment bubble, but mid- and late-stage valuations are growing too. |  |

# Avoided to Save Money: Needed Medical Care and Mental Health Care

| Year | Uninsured People (Millions) | Percentage Avoiding Care |
|------|-----------------------------|--------------------------|
| 2019 | 41M                         | 10%                      |
| 2024 | 27M                         | 8%                       |
| 2029 | 30M                         | 6%                       |
| 2034 | 33M                         | 4%                       |

The steady growth of health insurance coverage in America is starting to reverse course. In 2024, the number of uninsured people in the US went up to 27 million, the first increase since 2019. Now, federal budget cuts and changes in eligibility requirements for Medicare and Medicaid could add 14 million more uninsured in the next decade.¹ That has troubling implications for costs and outcomes as more people potentially avoid or postpone needed treatments. We’re already seeing the start of this dynamic play out. The percentage of Americans avoiding medical care, mental health treatment, and medication purchases are all increasing from their low marks in 2021. But avoiding treatments doesn’t really save money. The missed doctor’s appointment can easily become a much costlier emergency room visit later.

| Year | Per Capita Spending on Healthcare (US Dollars) | Hospital Care Percentage |
|------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| 2019 | $14K                                          | 31%                      |
| 2020 | $12K                                          |                          |
| 2021 | $12K                                          |                          |
| 2022 | $10K                                          |                          |
| 2023 | $10K                                          |                          |
| 2024 | $8K                                           |                          |

Hospital visits account for 31% of total US healthcare spending, which contributes to the US spending twice the median per capita on healthcare as other developed countries. US healthcare spending may be an outlier, but outcomes aren’t. For healthtech founders, the opportunity is clear. Cutting waste and improving efficiency should lead to direct benefits for payers, providers, and patients. But declining coverage rates make the task that much harder. Payers and self-insured employers have been the biggest buyers of healthtech solutions. As their covered populations drop, the total addressable markets for those solutions will drop too.

Capital pouring into AI healthtech has raced ahead of evidence. Nearly half of all AI-enabled medical device recalls happened within the first year of clearance — double the rate for devices overall. The FDA’s 510(k) pathway, which fast-tracks approval without requiring human testing, has enabled speed but also left early performance issues unchecked.

The mismatch between investor optimism and clinical scrutiny is also showing up in adoption. Hospitals are leaning on lower-risk tools like scheduling assistants and revenue cycle automation that add efficiency without touching clinical workflows. For instance, about 46% of hospitals and health systems now use AI in their RCM operations. But higher stakes applications — such as autonomous imaging, hospital digital twins and GenAI-driven clinical decision support — remain largely on the sidelines, slowed by safety concerns, workflow challenges and regulatory gaps.

Valuations keep climbing, but the pattern is clear: Capital has moved faster than validation. Until evidence catches up, health systems will continue favoring incremental AI gains over transformative bets.

Paper becomes software, software becomes data, data becomes AI. It’s obviously revolutionary… [but] we’re in a failure-of-imagination phase. People can’t really wrap their heads around everything it will change. For a while, people couldn’t think of anything to do with a TV camera other than film a play.

### Mega-rounds in healthtech peaked in 2021, but the market has since settled into a steadier pace. While overall deal counts are lower, mega-rounds are 38% of total investment into healthtech this year, remaining a significant share of total capital raised. The focus of these deals has shifted. Where alternative care once led, provider operations now dominate, representing the majority of mega-deals in 2025. While we’ve seen this shift to provider operations in non-mega-deal investments as well, investors are concentrating on these technologies that provide health data platforms and AI-driven documentation rather than alternative care bets.

It wasn’t that long ago that alternative care — clinical tools like virtual primary care, remote specialties or asynchronous prescribing — was the central pillar of healthtech. Investment peaked in 2021 at 42% of all healthtech dollars. Starting in 2023, however, provider operations — tools for revenue cycle management, patient outreach, scheduling, analytics and other front or back office tasks — has taken the plurality of cash. Now provider ops has 44% of all healthtech investment, and alternative care is down to 9%, barely passing $1B in 2025 so far. The new low is a result of products that couldn’t scale and technology that rapidly became table stakes in most clinical platforms. Payments are complicated in alternative care and margins are thin, especially when compared to outwardly similar SaaS companies. Expansion is limited by clinician hiring, state licensing and payer enrollments. Provider ops software, on the other hand, has clearer business cases, faster return on investment and benefits more from the rapid growth of AI, especially GenAI. Now ambient documentation has taken off as the new hottest tool in the healthcare kit, at least as far as investing goes. Wave one of digital health built the foundation. Wave two flooded the market with new care models and platforms. The new wave of healthtech is about intelligence… generative and agentic AI systems that don’t just document or support the delivery of care, but will redefine how care is delivered, managed, and scaled.

# Work Efficiency

| Metric                        | 2024 | 2023 |
|-------------------------------|------|------|
| Work Efficiency               | 75%  | 69%  |
| Clinical Outcomes             | 62%  | 61%  |
| Patient Safety                | 56%  | 56%  |
| Stress and Burnout           | 44%  | 54%  |
| Capacity to See Patients      | 46%  | 52%  |
| Cognitive Overload            | 40%  | 48%  |
| Patient Privacy               | 15%  | 15%  |

There’s nothing inevitable about AI in healthcare. When it’s prospering, it’s because AI tools are offering real value, addressing long-standing issues and helping solve significant problems. In an industry plagued by staffing shortages, automation is invaluable. Workflows that are still overwhelmingly — and sometimes painfully — manual need tools that can bring efficiency, let clinicians focus on patients, and even help bring staff home at night. When AI can’t be relied on or trusted, however, it won’t make inroads. Patient safety is non-negotiable in healthcare, so large language models (LLMs) that struggle to provide consistent, accurate advice won’t find clinical adopters. Patient privacy and data security are almost as important. Watch a hospital administrator’s face when someone mentions HIPAA violations, and you’ll understand why transparent data policies are essential. A promising use case is in helping supplement clinicians domain knowledge. Chatbots may never be independent providers, but they’re good test takers. Top LLMs are performing as well as competitive human applicants on medical licensing exams and general knowledge tests.

Clinicians and administrators aren’t the only people who need to be convinced. Most patients are happy to provide consent for ambient AI until corporate partners and data policies are explained. Then willingness to give consent drops by 33%. Earning trust is going to be more important for AI healthcare companies than any technical challenge.

Providers are increasingly willing to use AI. Overwork and manual tasks in electronic health records (EHRs) have been a burden on physicians and other healthcare workers for decades. AI companies promise tools to help in difficult areas like documentation, billing, care plans, messaging and pre-visit planning.

Investors are jumping on these trends. Investment has flowed into the space, reliably doubling annually since 2023. With that much coming in, you’d expect a bustling competitive space. You’d be wrong. Of the $2.75B that's been invested since 2022, more than half has gone to just five companies. Of the nearly $1.5B already invested in 2025, 40% went to just a single company, Abridge.

This capital has concentrated while an existential threat looms. Microsoft’s Nuance partnered with leading EHR vendor Epic in 2017. While Abridge partnered with Epic in 2023, the EHR giant has reportedly divested its shares while announcing a suite of integrated AI tools. Competition emerging from within an EHR is the single biggest worry of most healthcare startups. To compete with behemoths like Microsoft, Google or OpenAI, startups need to showcase the agility and domain expertise larger companies struggle with. Companies like Eleos and Rad AI that have picked specialty niches may end up with an easier competitive path than anyone trying to compete as a generalist solution.

# Healthtech IPOs Tell a Story of Broken Expectations

| IPO | M&#x26;A | Secondaries |
|-----|-----|-------------|
| 1   | 4   | 4           |

**Current Ownership Status of Companies That Went Public Between 2020 and 2022**
| Market Capitalization | Publicly Held | Acquired/Merged | Privately Held |
|----------------------|---------------|------------------|----------------|
| $14B                 | 76%           | 18%              | 3%             |

The IPO boom of 2021 quickly gave way to a freeze, as public markets reset valuations and the window for new listings shut. By 2022, IPOs were virtually absent, leaving M&#x26;A as the only consistent path to liquidity for healthtech companies. The companies that did go public between 2020 and 2022 have struggled. Many now trade well below their offering valuations. Eighteen percent have been acquired or merged, but a handful maintain meaningful public market caps. The wave of listings did not translate into lasting public success.

Meanwhile, unicorns keep piling up. Of the 10 most valuable private healthtech companies, eight haven’t raised at a higher valuation in over three years. That long wait underscores a tough reality: Large, late-stage companies are stuck between lofty private valuations and public markets unwilling to meet them. The result is a backlog of unicorns with uncertain exit paths, waiting for either market conditions to improve or valuations to come back to earth.

While the IPO window shows a few bright spots, PE-backed combinations remain active. For many digital health companies, strategic M&#x26;A represents a practical path to scale and liquidity.
