## Slide 5: Problem Statement

The way medical providers bill for services, and the
way patients pay for care is broken, and it's only
getting worse.

Adonis

## Slide 6: The Provider Problem

The Provider Problem
Medical providers incur a **14% COGS** just to process
billing to insurance payers.
You read that right.
Billing and insurance related activities cost over **$99,000**
per medical provider per year and represents nearly **$1**
in every **$7** collected by a medical facility\*.

## Slide 7: Solution Whitespace

## Slide 11: Go-To-Market and Adonis Differentiators

Go-To-Market and Adonis Differentiators

**Adonis is Extensible and Comprehensive**
*   No matter where providers are in their RCM journey, Adonis can help them reach their full potential.
*   Adonis works with private practices, digital health companies, RCM services providers, and hospitals to: assume end-to-end billing, power automations alongside incumbent workflows, and/or provide revenue intelligence to help existing billing teams prevent and mitigate denials.

**Adonis Value Proposition**
*   Adonis' integration engine and flexible data model means providers don't have to change their software stack to start seeing revenue cycle improvements.
*   The Adonis claims ingestion and ML-driven analytics engine learns from customers' historical data and becomes smarter over time.
*   Adonis becomes smarter with every nth + 1 claim processed.

Adonis assumes all billing responsibilities for providers, including claims creation, claims scrubbing, submission and denials management.
Adonis pricing model: 2.5-3.5% of reimbursed revenue (with monthly minimums)

**Persona 2: In-house Operations and RCM teams partner with Adonis to automate workflows**
For practices and organizations that have invested in internal revenue cycle teams, Adonis can automate workflows at the front- and back-end. Examples include patient benefits verification, patient intake, underpayments detection, denials prioritization/queuing, etc.

**Persona 3: Revenue Analytics for RCM organizations (In-house and External)**
