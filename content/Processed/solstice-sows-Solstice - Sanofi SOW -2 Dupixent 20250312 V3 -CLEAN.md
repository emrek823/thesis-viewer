### Outputs; Disclaimer

CUSTOMER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT OUTPUTS MAY CONTAIN INACCURATE OR INCOMPLETE INFORMATION AND SOLSTICE MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES AND PROVIDES NO INDEMNITIES WITH RESPECT THERETO; CUSTOMER AND ITS END USERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL DECISIONS MADE, ADVICE GIVEN, ACTIONS TAKEN, AND FAILURES TO TAKE ACTION BASED ON THEIR USE OF THE PLATFORM. CUSTOMER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT SOLSTICE IS NOT PROVIDING LEGAL, FINANCIAL, TAX OR ANY OTHER ADVICE, AND THAT CUSTOMER IS ADVISED TO CONSULT WITH ITS OWN LEGAL AND FINANCIAL ADVISORS AND TAX EXPERTS.

THE PLATFORM, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ALL CONTENT, SOFTWARE, AND FUNCTIONS MADE AVAILABLE ON OR ACCESSED THROUGH OR SENT FROM THE SOLSTICE PLATFORM, WEBSITE, OR MOBILE APPLICATIONS, ARE PROVIDED “AS IS,” “AS AVAILABLE,” AND “WITH ALL FAULTS.” TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY LAW, EXCEPT AS SPECIFICALLY PROVIDED IN THE SOW, SOLSTICE MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OR ENDORSEMENTS OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER (EXPRESS OR IMPLIED) ABOUT: (A) THE PLATFORM; (B) THE CONTENT AND SOFTWARE ON AND PROVIDED THROUGH THE PLATFORM; (C) THE FUNCTIONS MADE ACCESSIBLE ON OR ACCESSED THROUGH THE PLATFORM; AND (D) SECURITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE TRANSMISSION OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION THROUGH THE PLATFORM. SOLSTICE DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE PLATFORM, ANY OF THE PLATFORM’S FUNCTIONS OR ANY CONTENT CONTAINED THEREIN WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE; THAT DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED; THAT THE PLATFORM OR THE SERVERS THAT MAKE IT AVAILABLE ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS; OR THAT BUSINESS OUTCOMES SHALL BE AFFECTED IN ANY PARTICULAR WAY.

Customer is responsible for ensuring that the Platform, Output, and any other information or materials made available via the Platform are suitable for Customer’s use. Customer understands and agrees that Solstice is not a law firm or an attorney, may not perform services performed by an attorney, and is not the substitute for the advice or services of an attorney.

No attorney-client relationship or privilege is created with Solstice.

### Indemnification

Solstice will defend Customer from and against any third-party claim to the extent alleging that the Platform (excluding Customer Data therein and Outputs generated thereby) infringes or misappropriates a third-party’s U.S. patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret, and will indemnify and hold harmless Customer against any damages and costs awarded against Customer (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) or agreed in a settlement by Solstice resulting from the claim.

Customer will defend Solstice from and against any third-party claim to the extent resulting from Customer Data or Customer’s breach or alleged breach of Section 1.4 and 2.3 and will indemnify and hold harmless Solstice against any damages and costs awarded against Solstice (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) or agreed in a settlement by Customer resulting from the claim.

The indemnifying party’s obligations in this Section 4 are subject to it receiving: (a) prompt written notice of the claim (provided that a failure or delay in providing such notice shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its indemnification obligations except to the extent it is materially prejudiced thereby); (b) the exclusive right to control and direct the investigation, defense, and settlement of the claim; and (c) all reasonably necessary cooperation of the indemnified party, at the indemnifying party’s expense for reasonable out-of-pocket costs. The indemnifying party may not settle any claim without the indemnified party’s prior consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned) if settlement would require the indemnified party to admit fault or take or refrain from taking any action (other than relating to use of the Platform, when Solstice is the indemnifying party). The indemnified party may participate in a claim with its own counsel at its own expense.

In response to an actual or potential infringement or misappropriation claim or otherwise relating to violation of intellectual property rights, if required by settlement or injunction or as Solstice determines necessary to avoid material liability, Solstice may at its option: (a) procure rights for Customer’s continued use of the Platform; (b) replace or modify the allegedly infringing portion of the Platform to avoid infringement or misappropriation without reducing the Platform’s overall functionality; or (c) terminate the SOW and refund to Customer any pre-paid, unused fees for the terminated portion of the SOW Term. Solstice’s obligations in this Section 4 do not apply: (a) to infringement or misappropriation resulting from Customer’s modification of the Platform or use of the Platform in combination with items not provided by Solstice (including Third-Party Services); (b) to infringement resulting from software other than the most recent release; (c) to unauthorized use of the Platform, breach of this SOW, or Customer’s gross negligence or willful misconduct; (d) if Customer settles or makes any admissions about a claim without Solstice’s prior consent; or (e) free or evaluation use.

This Section 4 sets out Customer’s exclusive remedy and Solstice’s entire liability regarding infringement or misappropriation of third-party intellectual property rights.

### Limitations of Liability

Except for Excluded Claims (as defined below) neither party (nor its suppliers or licensors) will have any liability arising out of or related to this SOW for any loss of use, lost data, lost profits, failure of security mechanisms, interruption of business, or any indirect, special, incidental, reliance, or consequential damages of any kind, even if informed of their possibility in advance.

Except for Excluded Claims, each party’s (and its suppliers’ and licensor’s) entire liability arising out of or related to this SOW will not exceed in aggregate the amounts paid or payable by Customer to Solstice pursuant to this SOW during the 12 months prior to the date on which the applicable claim giving rise to the liability arose under this SOW.

“Excluded Claims” means:

*   (a) Customer’s breach of Sections 1.4 or 2.3;
*   (b) either party’s breach of Section 7 (Confidentiality) (but excluding claims relating to Customer Data); or
*   (c) amounts payable to third parties under the indemnifying party’s obligations in Section 4 (Indemnification).

The waivers and limitations in this Section 5 apply regardless of the form of action, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability or otherwise and will survive and apply even if any limited remedy in this SOW fails of its essential purpose.

### Termination

Either party may terminate this SOW if the other party:

*   (a) fails to cure a material breach of this SOW (including a failure to pay fees) within 30 days after notice;
*   (b) ceases operation without a successor; or
*   (c) seeks protection under a bankruptcy, receivership, trust deed, creditors’ arrangement, composition, or comparable proceeding, or if such a proceeding is instituted against that party and not dismissed within 60 days. If the SOW is terminated for any reason, Customer will promptly cease all use of the Platform.

### Confidentiality

“Confidential Information” means information disclosed to the receiving party (“Recipient”) under this SOW that is designated by the disclosing party (“Discloser”) as proprietary or confidential or that should be reasonably understood to be proprietary or confidential due to its nature and the circumstances of its disclosure. Solstice’s Confidential Information includes the terms and conditions of this SOW and any technical or performance information about the Platform. Customer’s Confidential Information includes Customer Data.

As Recipient, each party will:

*   (a) hold Confidential Information in confidence and not disclose it to third parties except as permitted in this SOW, including Section 2; and
*   (b) only use Confidential Information to fulfill its obligations and exercise its rights in this SOW. At Discloser’s request, Recipient will delete all Confidential Information, except, in the case where Solstice is the Recipient, Solstice may retain the Customer’s Confidential Information to the extent required to continue to provide the Platform. Recipient may disclose Confidential Information to its employees, agents, contractors, and other representatives having a legitimate need to know (including, for Solstice, the subcontractors referenced in Section 2.5), provided it remains responsible for their compliance with this Section 7 and they are bound to confidentiality obligations no less protective than this Section 7.

These confidentiality obligations do not apply to information that Recipient can document:

*   (a) is or becomes public knowledge through no fault of the receiving party;
*   (b) it rightfully knew or possessed prior to receipt under this SOW;
*   (c) it rightfully received from a third party without breach of confidentiality obligations; or
*   (d) it independently developed without using Confidential Information.

Unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information may cause substantial harm for which damages alone are an insufficient remedy. Each party may seek appropriate equitable relief, in addition to other available remedies, for breach or threatened breach of this Section 7.

Nothing in this SOW prohibits either party from making disclosures, including of Customer Data and other Confidential Information, if required by Law, subpoena, or court order, provided (if permitted by Law) it notifies the other party in advance and cooperates in any effort to obtain confidential treatment.

### Proprietary Rights

As between the parties, notwithstanding anything to the contrary,

*   (a) Customer shall retain all right, title and interest in and to the Customer Data and Outputs, including all intellectual property rights therein and
*   (b) Solstice retains all right, title, and interest in and to

    *   (ii) Usage Data and Aggregated Data.

Customer acknowledges and agrees that the Platform may operate on, with or using application programming interfaces (APIs) and/or other services operated or provided by third parties (such as Third-Party LLM Providers) (collectively, “Third-Party Services”), including without limitation through integrations or connectors to such Third-Party Services that are provided by Solstice. Solstice is not responsible for the operation of any Third-Party Services nor the availability or operation of the Platform to the extent such availability and operation is dependent upon Third-Party Services. Solstice does not make any representations or warranties with respect to Third-Party Services or any third-party providers. Customer agrees that Customer’s use of the Platform including Inputs and implementation of Outputs will not breach or violate any applicable Third-Party LLM Provider terms and policies, including without limitation OpenAI’s Usage Policies, available at https://openai.com/policies/usage-policies/, or Anthropic’s Usage Policy, available at https://www.anthropic.com/legal/aup.

Customer acknowledges that Output is generated automatically by machine learning technology and may be similar to or the same as Output provided to other customers, and no rights to any Output generated, provided, or returned by the Platform for or to other customers are granted to Customer under the SOW.

Customer may (but is not obligated to) provide suggestions, comments or other feedback to Solstice with respect to the Platform (“Feedback”) and Solstice may freely use and exploit such Feedback.
