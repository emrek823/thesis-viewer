# Gyde | Investor Monthly Overview

## October 2025
### Summary
October was a big month for Gyde. We signed our first two LOIs (Avid, Benavest), and received a verbal confirmation to move to a third (Capstone). We shipped our first AI application and are now live with our design partners. Our team continues to be built out and has maintained a world-class talent bar, with key additions from organizations like Stripe, Vista Equity Partners and Resurgence, Oscar, and Bain & Company. Finally, we signed a preemptive term sheet with Lightspeed for our Series A and are now actively working to add another anchor capital partner to the round. We welcome questions, but would ask that this not be socialized externally. While we want to remain largely silent in terms of major public announcements, we launched our [homepage](https://www.gyde.ai) to strong reviews from external stakeholders. As we move towards 2026, our focus will now shift to filling key leadership roles (e.g. CTO) and executing our Value Creation plan for our acquired partners.

The combination of Avid, Benavest, and Capstone will bring us an estimated $55-$60M in revenue and ~$5M in EBITDA as we enter 2026. It also reinforces that our M&A machine can acquire assets in all three of our target segments, without an over-reliance on our own rolodex to drive deal flow and LOI signatures. While we recognize we still need to get through diligence and closing, we view the ability to get to this point in ~14 weeks as a strong signal. Looking out further, the pipeline looks strong and we have 3-5 candidates that we believe could move to LOI signature in 1H of 2026. While we acknowledge our mid-funnel performance is strong, we still believe we are underperforming in driving top-of-the-funnel action. Our model relies on our ability to execute a high-velocity M&A motion, which requires significant top-of-the-funnel lead generation. Right-sizing this will be a core focus for us, and reinforces why we are now searching for a Head of Growth.

We have started to roll out our Renewal Application to a small cohort of members on our design partner's books. The SMS-based agent is automating the scheduling of consultations, intaking auto-renewal requests for members who don't need a meeting, and collecting other clinical, financial, and living situation data. The latter can include things like needing help with SNAP (also an income proxy) and adding adopted children to their family / policy, both of which are real examples from information Gyde's agent is ingesting. We will have more information to share here as we get deeper into AEP / OEP, and launch the ACA agent on 11/1.

From a team perspective, we have added full-stack, ML, and infrastructure engineering talent with the addition of Andrew, Michael, and David (now full-time), built the foundation for our Value Creation function with Nick and Christian, and added Holland as our Chief of Staff. We continue to focus on CTO recruiting, identifying candidates to fill the Head of Growth role, and, longer term, opportunistically looking at leaders for our M&A function.

## Key Needs or Asks
*   Adding world-class full-stack engineers to the team remains a core focus for us, so we continue to welcome introductions to those with 5+ years of experience and strong pedigrees.
*   We are hiring a Head of Growth to supercharge our top-of-the-funnel M&A efforts. We'd welcome any intros here, particularly those in BD or Origination at Lower Middle Market PE firms or leading sales at high growth software companies.
*   Please hold on announcing or disclosing your involvement with Gyde until mid-January. We are coordinating a larger launch announcement and will provide guidance to all of you as we get closer to the date.
