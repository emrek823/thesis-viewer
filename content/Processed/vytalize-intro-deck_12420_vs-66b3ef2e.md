# VYTALIZE HEALTH Pitch Deck

## Slide 1: VYTALIZE HEALTH

VYTALIZE HEALTH
Faster Adoption, Better Outcomes, Lower Cost;
Value-Based Care for Medicare Patients

Faris Ghawi, CEO
faris.ghawi@vytalizehealth.com

VYTALIZE HEALTH

## Slide 2: Background

Background

As healthcare transitions to value-based payment models, physicians are being compensated for improving outcomes and lowering total costs, rather than for volume of services.

VYTALIZE HEALTH

## Slide 3: Problem

Problem

Currently, $250B/yr. is wastefully spent by the U.S. government on senior care through independent primary care physicians, who lack the infrastructure to manage the budget.

VYTALIZE HEALTH
3

## Slide 4: Solution

Solution

Instead of independent physicians managing both the $250B budget and patient health outcomes, we manage the budget for them

VYTALIZE HEALTH

## Slide 5: Introducing Vytalize

Introducing Vytalize

VYTALIZE HEALTH

Vytalize Health is a platform for integrating independent physicians and turning them from followers to drivers of value-based healthcare

VYTALIZE HEALTH

## Slide 6: Why Physicians Join Us

Why Physicians Join Us

Our solution triples primary care physicians' revenue from senior care without investment, and we take a 40% cut

(while improving patient outcomes)

VYTALIZE HEALTH

## Slide 7: How it Works

How it Works

When physicians join our platform, we gain full access to their patients' data and assume their budget

(Data received directly from Medicare through our ACO)

VYTALIZE HEALTH

## Slide 8: How it Works

How it Works

We analyze the data and identify missed revenue opportunities and unnecessary costs

Then, our platform provides tools and services to help and incentivize physicians to capitalize on these opportunities

(while improving patient outcomes)

## Slide 9: Results

Results

As a result, primary care physicians make more money while the total cost of care per patient goes down

**Annual Spend Per Patient**

| Category        | Pre-Vytalize (Total Cost Per Year: $11K) | With Vytalize (Total Cost: $10K) |
| :-------------- | :--------------------------------------- | :------------------------------- |
| Primary Care    | $500 (5%)                                | $1,100 (11%)                     |
| Other Costs     | $10,500                                  | $8,900                           |

Our business model capitalizes on both the increase in primary care services and reduction in total cost

**Average Example:**
$500 per patient → $1,500
($1,100 + $400 shared savings)

Vytalize takes a $600 cut

## Slide 10: Go-to-Market

Go-to-Market

Unlike private Medicare Advantage (MA) plans, which are required to sign up 1 patient at a time, our model has the incredible advantage of acquiring 100s of patients at a time by signing up their physicians
