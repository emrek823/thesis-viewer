## Slide 3: Background on quality registries

**What is a clinical quality registry?**
* Unique registry is completed for most surgeries, inpatient stays, and serious conditions
* Submitted to 3rd party association or society for quality benchmarking (e.g. ACC, AHA, STS, ACS)
* Data is used for quality control, benchmarking and is required to maintain accreditation
* Data abstraction is usually performed by clinically-trained staff (nurses)

**Challenges:**
* Hundreds of structured fields, but EHR data is unstructured
* Terminology and location in the record vary
* Human abstraction requires clinical and registry-specific experience
* Difficult to find and retain qualified staff
* AI-based abstraction wasn't possible at scale until now

## Slide 4: Clinical registry abstraction today...

1-2 hours per registry case spent by clinically trained staff (nurses)

**EMR**
*(Image displays a screenshot of an "Epic Home" Electronic Medical Record for "John W. Smith", showing various sections like SnapShot, Chart Review, Flowsheets, Problem List, History, Letters, Demographics, Chief Complaint, Nursing Notes, Vitals, Exercise Vitals with details on height, peak flow, and exercise level of effort.)*

**Quality Registry**
*(Image displays a screenshot of a "Coronary Anatomy" Quality Registry form, showing structured fields for Coronary Circulation, Diagnostic Cath Status, Rx Recommendation, Native Vessels (Segment Number, Segment Name, % stenosis diameter, Adjunctive Measurements Obtained, Fractional Flow Reserve Ratio, Instantaneous Wave-Free Ratio, Intravascular Ultrasonography (IVUS), Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)), and Graft Vessels with similar detailed fields.)*

## Slide 6: Our AI automatically completes the registry forms

*(Image displays a screenshot of the Health Elements interface. On the left, a navigation panel shows "Workspace Title", "Case ID: 7783342", "Demographics", "Episode of Care", "Cath Lab Visit #1", "Pre-procedure Information", "Cath Lab Visit #2", "Add Cath Lab Visit", "Discharge", "Follow-up". The main content area shows "Pre-procedure Information" with a section for "Electrocardiac Assessment Method" (options: ECG, Telemetry Monitor, Holter Monitor, Other), "Electrocardiac Assessment Results" (options: Normal, Abnormal, Uninterpretable), "New Antiarrhythmic Therapy Initiated Prior to Cath Lab" (options: No, Yes), "Electrocardiac Abnormality Type" ("T Wave Inversions" with an 'X' to remove), "Heart Rate" (with "BPM" unit), "Non-Sustained Ventricular Tachycardia Type" (options: Symptomatic, Newly Diagnosed, Other). On the right, a detail pane shows "Electrocardiac Assessment Method 5037" with a "High Confidence" tag. Tabs for "Evidence", "Patient Documents", "Definition". Under "Evidence", "Cardiology Consultation 4/23/2024" is displayed with "Diagnostic Data:" including "ECG: Shows old Q waves in leads II, III, and aVF; new T-wave inversions in V4-V6", "Chest X-ray: No acute cardiopulmonary process", "Labs: Elevated troponin I; creatinine 1.1 mg/dL, fasting glucose 142 mg/dL". An "Explanation" section states: "The text describes the findings from the ECG, indicating specific abnormalities such as old Q waves and new T-wave inversions, which are relevant to assessing the patient's cardiac condition.")*

## Slide 7: Solid results with our proprietary AI platform

*(Image displays a horizontal bar chart comparing accuracy. The accuracy scale is implicit, with a vertical line at 90% marked "Accuracy 90%")*

*   **Health Elements AI**: Bar extends to the 90% accuracy line.
*   **vs. GPT-4**: Bar is visibly shorter than Health Elements AI's bar.
*   **vs. Current Healthcare NLP**: Bar is visibly shorter than GPT-4's bar.

## Slide 8: Faster, more convenient and more efficient than traditional quality data abstraction

**Reduced costs**
Reduce costs by up to 50% vs. in-house and outsourced abstraction firms.

**Faster turnaround time**
Cut through your registry case backlog and access your quality data when it's most useful.

**More accessible data**
Access all of your structured quality data as soon as it's ready. Option to connect to your data warehouse by running in your own private cloud.

**Easy implementation**
Health Elements is easy to evaluate, implement and scale. No integration required to get started.

## Slide 9: Feedback from Customers

Our team currently spends almost **100% of our time on data abstraction and reporting**. We spend close to 0% of our time designing and implementing projects that actually improve quality. I wish that this ratio was reversed.
**Direct of Quality / NE Georgia Health System**

The software layout is perfect. I think it will be important to have a human in the loop for at least a couple of years until we can get people to accept this new way of doing things.
**Director of Analytics / UPMC**

We have conducted an evaluation of the Health Elements AI, Inc software compared to competitive solutions available on the market... **Health Elements's software solution yields strong performance in accuracy and coverage.**
**CEO / #1 Abstraction Services Company**

## Slide 10: Clinical data abstraction is inefficient

(as it's done today)

**Expensive**
A single health system may have over 100 clinically-trained people supporting quality reporting efforts, with a budget of over $10M per year.

**Wasteful**
Valuable clinically trained staff are down-leveled to working as data entry technicians

**Time Consuming**
Quality management professionals spend the majority of their time reporting on quality vs. designing projects to improve it.

**Required**
Required for accreditation by the association or society. Quality measures are increasingly used by payers.

**CASE STUDY**
Cardiology center for regional single state health system

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Full Time Employees | 7 |
| Cardiology Cases / Year | 7,500 |
| Cost per Case | $140 |
| Budget (Labor + Software) [1] | $1.1M |

[1] - Represents one service line - most health systems have 5 - 10 service lines.

Investor Deck

## Slide 11: Our business models address the needs of any health system

**Software Only**
Base License $10-$25 / Case
* Their staff performs the final review
* 3x - 5x ROI based on realized time savings
* 6-figure ACV

*(Image displays a screenshot of the Health Elements interface, similar to Slide 6, demonstrating the "Software Only" model where the software assists in filling out forms.)*

**Full-Service Abstraction**
$40-$100 / Case
* Health Elements' staff will perform the final review
* Guaranteed savings, with reduced administrative overhead costs
* 6 to 7-figure ACV

*(Image displays a screenshot of the Health Elements interface, similar to the "Software Only" view but with a visual overlay of animated dots, implying a more active, managed service by Health Elements' staff completing the abstraction.)*

## Slide 12: Example: Cardiology service line for a small regional health system

There are additional registry teams across other service lines within the same health system

| Metric | Current Process | With Health Elements Software | Fully Managed by Health Elements |
|---|---|---|---|
| FTEs | 7 | 3 | 0 |
| Registry Cases per Year | 7,500 | 7,500 | 7,500 |
| Total Costs[1] | $1,150,000 | $600,000 | $500,000 |
| Cost per Registry Case | $140 | $80 | $66 |
| Percent of Cases Submitted on Time and in Range for Accuracy | 80% | 95% | 98% |

[1] Total costs include direct labor (not management) and additional software. Example is based on projected results from inputs provided by a pilot partner

*   Difficult to staff
*   80% to 90% of all abstractions today

*(Bar chart segment: $90 - $140)*

**Outsourced abstraction**
*   Accuracy issues, expensive
*   Often chosen due to staffing shortages or to fill a temporary gap
*   10% to 20% of all abstractions today ($200M+ revenue)

*(Bar chart segment: $100)*

**Health Elements**
*   Fastest, most accurate and lowest cost option
*   Relieves staffing shortages
*   Opportunity to win the market

*(Bar chart segment: $50 - $80)*
