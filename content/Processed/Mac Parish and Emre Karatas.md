### Topo’s Business Model Evolution

- Core insight: Fundamental supply shortage on investigator/site side of clinical trials
	- No one building directly for investigators to become research providers
	- Focus on existing investigators needing support vs. de novo development
- Current approach: Enable community clinics to build research programs
	- Working with larger health systems
	- Placing research capacity in underserved geographies
- Technology evolution since pre-GenAI founding
	- All trial enrollment steps are rules-based, ripe for AI automation
	- Building platform where on-site staff, remote staff, and AI agents collaborate
	- Moving patients through enrollment funnel and maintaining them on studies

### Market Positioning & Defensibility

- Patient identification (Trially) will become commoditized
- Vertical-specific voice models won’t outperform OpenAI-based solutions
- Defensible enterprise value exists further down the value chain
- Topo creating “landing place” for comprehensive trial management
	- Full-stack site network operations
	- Technology deployment across non-owned sites
	- Pull from CROs and sponsors to use tech platform

### Investigator Ecosystem Strategy

- Concentric circles of investigator sophistication
	- KOLs at major academic centers (UCSF) - must-haves for specific trials
	- Community plus networks (Texas Oncology, Florida Cancer Specialists)
	- Long-tail community oncologists requiring more support
- Philosophy: Need high volume of sites, not every investigator needs to be KOL
- Even KOLs often poor at actual trial execution vs. research/publishing

### Growth & Expansion Plans

- No current global expansion plans - plenty of US runway
- Considering separate technology entity from SMO operations
- SMO could use debt for site acquisitions, improve profitability
- Tech platform sellable to other site management organizations
- End goal: Integrated site distribution enabling CRO services expansion
	- Moving from $12-30B site-level market to full global CRO market

### Next Steps

- Topo hiring actively in clinical trials space
- Continued conversation planned between Mac and Emre
