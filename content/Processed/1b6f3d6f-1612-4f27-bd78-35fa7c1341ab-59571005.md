## Slide 3: By the Numbers

DATA

**By the Numbers**

**$25 billion/year** are wasted by hospitals vs. achievable benchmarks
**Clinical supply inflation sits at 8%**
**Medicaid cuts will cut hospital budgets by ~$200M+ per year**
Substantial **supply chain team cuts** in latest rounds of layoffs

Supply chain teams need to save more than ever, but struggle to do so.
**... why??**

## Slide 4: What makes the hospital supply chain so inefficient?

RESEARCH

**What makes the hospital supply chain so inefficient?**

To find out, we spoke to:

* ~300 hospital execs at **158 health systems**
* **30+ vendors** in the supply chain space
* Even **scrubbed in** to OR surgeries

The biggest source of inefficiency causes MONTHS of delay...

**Clinical Integration**
Supply chain teams lack efficient ways to present rich, trusted evidence to clinicians and secure buy-in for strategic sourcing initiatives. Buy-in is also disconnected from implementation.

## Slide 5: Sourcing and value analysis is episodic, slow and complex, throttling $M of savings per year

PROBLEM

**Sourcing and value analysis is episodic, slow and complex, throttling $M of savings per year**

**Initiation**
DAYS TO WEEKS
Tedious evidence gathering

**Analysis**
WEEKS
Siloed data and unstructured sources (financial, quality, operational)
≠ data

**Clinical Engagement**
MONTHS
Delays live in meetings, 1:1s, politics
Missing data = more analysis

**Implementation**
WEEKS
Approved ≠ Adopted
If drift wins, loops restart

## Slide 6: Meet Steven, a supply chain leader

PROBLEM

**Meet Steven, a supply chain leader**

**Steven**
"My priority is reducing variation and spend"

"Our priority is treating patients, not saving money"

Slow implementation
Drift

**1**
Steven uses utilization, contracts, and benchmarks and other data to find supplies that can lower hospital costs.

**2**
Steven spends MONTHS going back and forth with clinicians trying to convince them to switch supplies. They ask him for personalized data* that's hard for him to get.
*Peer-normed, cohort-adjusted, outcome-normalized case comparisons with evidence.

**3**
Steven spends this time in repetitive meetings, 1:1s with clinicians, getting more data, and manually tracking and sharing feedback and progress.

**4**
In the months after a decision is made, some clinicians revert to using their previous products. Over time, the process starts over again.

More information in appendix

**Today's gap**
Because Steve lacks the ability to efficiently share individualized data and collect feedback, initiatives stall.
→
Those delays add up to lost/delayed savings, and time wasted by administration and clinicians.

SOLUTION

**Clinical Engagement Campaigns**

**Identify**
Proactively identify opportunities for supply chain teams.
* Standardization
* Waste & Overuse
* New Product
* Quality & Recall

**Engage**
Automate the creation of clinical outreach campaigns. Campaigns are comprised of an ask, a personalized data package, and collateral about the supplies.
* Reminders
* Reengagement
* Peer Visibility

**Implement**
Automatically set up trials and cut tickets for preference card changes. Set up reengagement campaigns and surface visibility to clinical leaders to drive alignment.
* Ticket Creation
* Trial Management
* Contracting
* ERP
* Procedure Cards

**Monitor**
Plugging the "leaky bucket" of one-time supply chain initiatives, supply chain leaders can alert themselves or clinicians when they revert to using old supplies.
* Drift Monitoring
* Formulary Compliance

**Solution**
Talys brings the right information to engage the right clinician with the right message, then directly implements and monitors supply chain improvements.

**Campaign Preview**
This is a preview of the message that will be sent to the selected clinician. The content is personalized based on their data.

**QUESTION 1**
**DBM Standardization Opportunity**
Your current use of the **DePuy Synthes DBX® DBM Putty** adds **$915 per arthroplasty case** versus peers who predominantly use the on-contract **Medtronic Grafton™ DBM**. Matched cases and cohort outcomes (90-day readmit, infection, PROMs) show no clinical difference.

For indicated arthroplasty cases requiring a demineralized bone matrix (DBM), would you support standardizing from **DePuy Synthes DBX® DBM Putty** to **Medtronic Grafton™ DBM** (putty/matrix)? Both are system-agnostic DBMs with similar indications. Standardizing to one DBM would reduce SKUs, improve pricing leverage, and simplify handling and inventory without changing implant systems.

Product Information

**Summary** (AI-generated)
Several studies have directly compared Medtronic Grafton® DBM and DePuy Synthes DBX® DBM. A controlled lumbar fusion study that implanted both products in the same patients found nearly identical fusion rates at 12 and 24 months, with no statistically significant differences in outcomes. Preclinical models (rat and canine posterolateral fusion studies) likewise show that both DBX and Grafton achieve high fusion success, with only minor variation by formulation (putty, matrix, strip). While some animal studies suggest slightly higher performance for one product at certain time points, the overall evidence indicates that both DBMs perform comparably in promoting fusion when used with autograft, and that clinical differences are minimal.

**Detail**

| STUDY | DESIGN/POPULATION | KEY FINDINGS | STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE / CAVEATS |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Chang et al. (2021):** "Surgical outcomes of two kinds of DBM putties/local autograft composites in instrumented posterolateral lumbar fusion (PLF)"* | 19 patients, 27 fusion segments. Each patient got both Grafton® DBM + autograft on one side and DBX® DBM + autograft on the other side. Followed 12 & 24 months, with CT + radiograph assessments. | At 12 months: Grafton side ~59.5% fusion vs DBX ~51.9%; at 24 months: Grafton ~70.4% vs DBX ~66.7%. Clinical outcomes (pain, function) improved similarly. | Differences not statistically significant (P = 0.425 at 12 months; P = 0.574 at 24 months) between the two sides. |
| **Bhamb et al. (2019):** "Comparative Efficacy of Commonly Available Human Bone Graft Substitutes as Tested for Posterolateral Fusion in an Athymic Rat | Preclinical animal model (rats). Tested multiple DBMs incl. DBX Mix, DBX Strip, Grafton Putty, Grafton Matrix, etc., vs other graft types. | Most DBMs (including both DBX and Grafton variants) had very high fusion ("manual palpation fusion" (F_MP) ~100% in many DBM products, | Animal model, so limited direct applicability to human arthroplasty. Also variations among products (strip, mix, putty) and carriers matter (handling, volume, etc.). |

## Slide 20: Defensibility

DEFENSIBILITY

**Defensibility**

What prevents an incumbent or competitor from fast-following after we've proved the concept?

*   **Engagement is difficult to bolt-on**
    Clarium/VC upstart focused on integrating and analyzing aggregate data, but not the personalization infrastructure needed for engagement.

*   **Data**
    By passively building a repository of clinician preferences as part of Talys usage, switching to another vendor inherently means starting from scratch in codifying clinician preferences.

*   **Misaligned incentives with GPO**
    GPOs refrain from opinionated stances on standardization since they receive a 2.5% fee from the manufacturers which has historically misaligned their incentives.

*   **Stickiness**
    Our workflow becomes core to value analysis and provider performance initiatives, especially as clinicians become accustomed to this form of engagement.

## Slide 21: Funding Ask

FUNDING

**Funding Ask**

**We are raising a $1.5M SAFE to build out the Talys platform with our three pilot customers**

**For the Talys MVP we need to focus on delivering a high-quality clinician-facing experience. If the clinician experience does not meet their expectations (primarily data, cohorts, and evidence), they will not engage.**

**Q2 2026 Objectives**
*   Delivering pilots to prove out engagement story
*   Tripling the number of pilots and convert to trial model
*   Get to revenue

**Major Uses of Funds**
*   Expand team (1 data scientist, 1-2 engineers, 1 part-time product designer)
*   SOC2 type 2 audit to smooth pathway to revenue
*   Sales license – data packages
*   Technology (Sigma computing, AWS)
*   Additional costs (admin, legal, costs)

## Slide 24: Risk Factors

RISK FACTORS

**Risk Factors**

| Risk | Detail | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| **Clinician Engagement** | We have UX research, anecdotal and survey data that indicates that clinicians will engage digitally with hospital supply chain asks if the asks are optimized based on what they want to see. | Gathering real-world data on clinician engagement is the primary focus of our pre-seed period so we can iterate on engagement quickly. |
| **Software Alone is Insufficient** | By design, nothing about the Talys platform forces clinicians to engage with clinical campaigns. Participation in clinical change will inevitably be lower for high-preference items or at IDNs without leadership buy-in. | 1) In clinician messaging, we plan to hammer home that engaging with Talys is a **replacement** for time-consuming meetings for the large amount of non Tier1 VAC meetings that happen today. <br> 2) Rejections in change campaigns will be more visible than ever before which can make in-person intervention more effective. <br> 3) Campaigns for high-preference items can still gather data that will make the value analysis process faster and still provide significant value. <br> Our software can work with bad orgs. <br> A great org makes our software even more valuable |
| **Long hospital sales cycles** | Like any SaaS product being sold into hospitals, we will likely find that the sales process is long and filled with numerous blockers. | Aggressively managing this process will be critical, especially in the early days of the company. |
| **"Second Year" Savings** | We must prove Year-2+ savings. Pilot conversations suggest recurring value, but current figures are estimate-based and must be trued-up with actuals. Ongoing market churn, new product launches, vendor share pushes, physician rotation, and persistent price pressure, create continuous opportunities to re-align to lowest cost/clinically-equivalent options; we just need the data trail to demonstrate it. | **Instrument for actuals:** lock baselines and counterfactuals in pilots; monthly true-ups that separate one-time "backlog" savings from recurring run-rate. <br> **Prove persistence:** cohort tracking by category/physician showing savings durability and re-capture after changes (new SKUs, vendor pushes, staff turnover). <br> **Automate the recurrence:** accelerate our roadmap to automate sourcing & negotiation so formulary stays aligned to the lowest-priced, clinically-equivalent items. <br> **Category rotation plan:** schedule new categories each quarter to offset tapering in early wins and keep the savings flywheel turning. <br> **Commercial alignment:** structure value-based pricing/gainshare tied to verified Year-2+ savings so incentives match outcomes. |

## Slide 25: The sourcing and value analysis process is slow, episodic, and complex, throttling $M of savings per year

PROBLEM

**The sourcing and value analysis process is slow, episodic, and complex, throttling $M of savings per year**

**Initiation**
DAYS TO WEEKS
*   **Physician Request** (request form, VAC tool)
*   **New Product Innovation** (shows, reps, conferences)
*   **Contract Renewal**
*   **Strategic Sourcing Initiatives**
    *   Contract consolidation
    *   Alt supplier ID
    *   PPI substitution
    *   GPO participation change
    *   Multi-year
    *   Single vs. multi-use
    *   SLA
    *   Tech driven
    *   Contract strategy (capitated, etc.)

**Analysis**
WEEKS to MONTHS
*   **Analytics & Scorecards**
    *   Profitability
    *   Quality
    *   Preferences
    *   Contract Compliance
    *   Performance
    *   Interchangeability
*   Analysis does not have clear ask and is often insufficiently cohort and outcome adjusted or missing key data elements

**Clinical Engagement**
MONTHS
*   **Clinical Feedback on...**
    *   Case Cost Variance Explainability Policy, practice, preference, or habit
    *   Quality explainability Commentary on quality statistics
    *   Interchangeability SME & Physician Input on interchangeability
*   Engagement is facilitated through 1000s of e-mails per year
*   Scorecards are not cohorted and outcome adjusted correctly
*   1:1s huddles → committees (episodic + calendar-bound)
*   "Show me another cut" resets work
*   VAC/P&T deferrals push decisions out months
*   Roster churn means re-education loops.

**Implementation**
WEEKS to MONTHS
*   **Trials**
    *   Temporary periop changes & feedback
*   **Conversions**
    *   Item master, contracts, MMIS, item master, preference card, etc.
*   **Monitoring**
    *   Implementation does not happen right away and often is not reflected downstream
    *   If drift wins, loops restart
    *   Case cost differences
    *   Supplier performance
    *   Off-formulary utilization
    *   Compliance rift
    *   Quality drift

**Very Manual and Episodic:** Lots of pulling data together from decision support tools, long e-mail threads, committee meetings, unanswered surveys, and task management tools, lots of 1:1s

Outlook

## Slide 26: Pilot Timeline (avoiding death by pilot)

GROWTH PLAYBOOK

**Pilot Timeline**
(avoiding death by pilot)

We have already begun with 2 systems (initial data, initiative identification, team mobilization)

We have a direct and focused path to monetization. Much our work involves upgrading our initial prototype to large production grade datasets and building out additional features. Building engagement is central to the pilots. We are building out the v1 production version with very few assumptions to allow for scalability and expansion to additional use cases.

| Milestone | Projected Delivery | Key Activities |
|---|---|---|
| **V.1 Data Prep & Opp Identification** | 11/01/25 - 12/04/25 | * Generalized schemas and normalized data. <br> * First pass identified cohorts of procedures for the selected item. <br> * Created views of the data for data package generation that includes cohorts and constructs. <br> * Onboard analyst to develop initial patterns for opportunity identification (to be replaced with AI in the future). |
| **V.1 Productionization** | 12/01/25 - 01/09/26 | * Clinical evidence and AI summarization <br> * Intelligent engagement (to be augmented with AI) <br> * First version of clinician scorecard released <br> * Email deliverability monitoring <br> * Question and data package modifications (to be augmented with AI in the future) <br> * Complete audit trail of all backend calls <br> * Buildout of enterprise configurability (settings) <br> * Likely innumerable bug fixes |
| **First Campaigns Launch** | 12/01/25 - 01/13/26 | * Initial set of campaigns launched <br> * Additional campaigns fast following or occurring during this period |
| **V.2 Groundwork** | 2/14/26 - 03/27/26 | * SOC2 Type 2 compliance certification received. <br> * Integration with benchmarking data provider (GPO) and/or ECRI (possibly sooner based on discussions) |
| **Contract** | 1/15/26 - 2/13/26 | * Contracting starts post-engagement milestone success. <br> * Supply chain team leads contracting already, allowing for faster cycles (already in discussion about parameters and ranges of future agreement) |

We expect our path to monetization to run anywhere from 3 to 4 months.

## Slide 27: Different priorities, challenging expectations

PROBLEM

**Different priorities, challenging expectations**

"My job is to deliver high-quality care for my patients."
"My job is to reduce variation and spend."

**Clinician Needs**
*   **NEEDS** peer-normed, cohort-adjusted, outcome-normalized case comparisons with evidence
*   **Generic**, cost-only asks feel risky so they won't engage.
*   Have **preferences** been trained on a certain product, prefers it, likes the rep

**Supply Chain Challenges**
*   **Manual tools** (email/Excel/portals) can't produce clinician-trusted evidence no cohorting, no quality controls.
*   **Cannot scale high-quality engagement**, leaving requests generic and unconvincing.
*   **Often not clinicians**, hard to rebut clinicians; clinical expertise can also not scale to all initiatives; lots of meetings, 1:1s

**Today's gap**
Change requests lack credible, clinician-relevant evidence
→
Clinicians don't engage
→
Initiatives stall and savings slip.

## Slide 28: Beyond analytics - pushing opportunities and realizing them through clinical engagement campaigns

**Beyond analytics - pushing opportunities and realizing them through clinical engagement campaigns**

**Opportunities pushed to Supply Chain**
* Standardization
* Waste / Overuse
* Quality
* New Product Introduction

**Supply Chain reviews opportunities** (data, physicians)

**1-Click Clinical Engagement**
Individualized ask, reports/data
Automated assembly

**Decision**
* Use less of X
* Switch from X to Y
* Stop using X
* Move X on to contract

**Input**
* Training-Gap
* Preference
* Edge-Case (e.g. unique case details)

**FYI**
* Notification of a change or observation (low friction)

**Algorithm drives personalized engagement**
* Ask Type
* Framing Priority
* Data Fidelity
* Routing Strategy
* Engagement Cohort

Low, medium, high preference distinction

(Flow chart of responses from x n clinicians)
* YES to change → Prefcard update
* Preference → Depending on context will route for escalation. Rule updated to drive better engagement
* Edge Case → Write rule to flag anomalies in future
* NO to change → Dept head + additional data request
* NO to change → Dept head + additional data request
* Training Gap → Build cohort for trial and possible updated training
