### Company Overview & Strategy

- FinCura building payments reconciliation for healthcare providers
	- Started with EFT-centric approach using bank account as source of truth
	- Plaid API connector sits on top of bank accounts to monitor insurance payments
	- Focus on money movement lens vs traditional RCM approach
- Strategic positioning against commoditization
	- Avoiding upper RCM stack (pre-auth, claims submission) - believes it will become commoditized
	- Targeting deeper fintech stack instead of health tech
	- Competing against “PDFs, pen and people” rather than venture-backed companies
- Product extends beyond reconciliation
	- Natural progression: insurance payments → patient payment collection → complete AR/AP visibility
	- Bank integration varies widely by institution (JP Morgan vs local credit unions provide different metadata)

### Market & Business Model

- Target: 1.1 million independently owned practices (vs PE-backed systems)
	- Each practice employs 1-1.5 FTE for payments posting ($40-75K annual cost)
	- ACVs reaching $50K per location (3-location dental group at 1.75% fee on $300K monthly volume)
- ROI drivers for providers:
- Distribution strategy
	- Digital acquisition at $1K-1.5K CAC with short payback periods
	- Embedded model through vertical SaaS platforms and third-party billers
	- Founder-led sales converting prospects Monday → contract signed Tuesday

### Fundraising & Next Steps

- Just kicked off seed raise yesterday
- Seeking right partner, not optimizing solely for dilution
- Data room ready, flexible on timeline (3 days to couple weeks)
- Virtue assessment: founder rated 3-4 across team strength, market, tech defensibility
	- Concerns: non-specific responses, limited defensibility beyond distribution
	- Overall gut: no second call due to risks across multiple areas
