somnolence after CPAP machine became nonfunctional. Vital
signs in the ED showed tachycardia, oxygen saturation of 95% on
4L oxygen, and he exhibited excessive daytime sleepiness, including
loud snoring. His symptoms were attributed to obstructive sleep
apnea exacerbation due to his CPAP machine failure and were
managed accordingly.

A 23-year-old male presented with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)
after having epigastric pain and a blood glucose level exceeding
500 mg/dL, despite no prior diabetes diagnosis. In the ED, he
received intravenous fluids and an insulin drip, leading to
resolution of his symptoms and improvement in blood glucose and
anion gap before ICU transfer. He was also being treated for a left
inner thigh abscess, which was managed with incision and
drainage, and had discontinued Cephalexin due to concerns over
a possible reaction.
