**Text:**
Healthcare's Missing Link
The Missing Link
* Healthcare has digitized storage (EHRs, claims, labs).
* The industry is investing in analytics (AI, insights).
* But identified data access & movement is broken and trapped in silos, faxes, and manual workflows

Data Silos → ? → Analytics

The Solution
* Hermes is building the rails for identified health data movement and access.
    * Visa for payments
    * Plaid for banking
    * Twilio for communications.

* Customer-submitted HIPAA Authorizations are frequently missing key elements required by providers.
* These deficiencies lead to denials — wasting time and money, with feedback loops often exceeding 20 days.

Solution: HIPAA Auth Checker
* Automatically reviews HIPAA Authorizations for 10 compliance gaps.
* Flags missing or invalid components and suggests precise corrections to ensure provider acceptance.

* Patients often cannot recall or accurately name the site details where they received care
* Medical canvassing is time-consuming and expensive.

Solution: Site Sonar
* Site Sonar uses a patient's PII and our Partner Network to automatically find care sites a patient has visited. Output includes:
    * Facility Name
    * Address
    * Speciality
    * Date

    * Routing directly to its ROI Partners
    * Faxing validated facilities using our efax service

## Slide 38: Step 5: OCR & Text Extraction

**Image:** An old illustration from "Alice in Wonderland" showing the Mad Hatter's tea party, with text below it.

**Text:**
Step 5: OCR & Text Extraction
Problem: Image Based Document
* Sites often send documents back that are scanned image of text documents
* These documents are thus hard to work with since they are not text based document

Solution: Text Extraction & OCR
* **Text Extraction:** Extracts the raw text from the document allowing you to work with the underlying raw text.
* **OCR:** Convert the image document into a text based PDF. It superimposes invisible ink over the tex making it searchable.

**Image Text (Excerpt):**
A MAD TEA-PARTY.

10/6
The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on
hearing this; but all he said was, "Why is a
raven like a writing-desk?"
"Come, we shall have some fun now!"
thought Alice. "I'm glad they've begun ask-
ing riddles—I believe I can guess that," she
added aloud.
"Do you mean that you think you can find
out the answer to it?" said the March Hare.
"Exactly so," said Alice.

## Slide 41: Solution: How it Works

**Image:** A detailed workflow diagram showing the flow of data and requests through the Hermes Health Unity Platform.

**Workflow Diagram Elements:**
1.  **Requestor** (top box)
    *   Arrow to "Secure Intake" and "Secure Delivery" (two boxes side-by-side)
2.  **Secure Intake** and **Secure Delivery**
    *   Arrows point down to "Unity Platform" (central box)
3.  **Unity Platform**
    *   Arrow points right to "Partner Route Engine"
    *   Arrow points down to "API Delivery"
4.  **Partner Route Engine**
    *   Arrow points down to "Partner (ROI, EHR, or RWD)"
5.  **Partner (ROI, EHR, or RWD)**
    *   Arrow points right to "Facility"
    *   Arrow points left to "Patient Data Retrived"
6.  **Facility** (rightmost box)
7.  **API Delivery**
    *   Arrow points down to "Patient Data"
8.  **Patient Data** and **Patient Data Retrived** (bottom boxes)
    *   Arrows from "Patient Data Retrived" and "Patient Data" point up to "Unity Platform" (not explicitly shown but implied loop or delivery)

**Text:**
Solution: How it Works
First Neutral API for Identified Health Data
The Hermes Health Unity Platform connects Requestors to a growing network of Partners—including ROI vendors, EHR systems, and RWD providers. How it works:
* **Secure Intake:** Requestors securely submit patient's full name, date of birth, and a signed HIPAA Authorization form.
* **Smart Routing:** The Unity Platform then routes these requests to our network of Partners.
* **Partner Fulfillment:** Our Partner networks processes these Requests and securely transmits identified patient data back to the Unity Platform.
* **Delivery:** The Unity Platform securely delivers the data back to requestors without revealing Partner-specific infrastructure or exposing individual Partner details, protecting privacy, and confidentiality
* **Transparent Pricing:** Each Partner is paid a clear, per-record/patient fee to keep pricing simple and aligned.
