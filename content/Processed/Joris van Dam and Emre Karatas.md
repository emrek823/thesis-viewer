### Background & Team

- Joris: Computer Science background with PhD in AI
- 25 years experience in life sciences (J&J, Novartis, Exact Sciences)
- Previously co-founded TriNetX with Jeremy
- Built multiple teams and platforms internally/externally in pharma tech

### Product & Technology Approach

- Platform leverages private LLM sessions with multi-agent prompt engineering
- Uses “Advocare Index” to provide targeted patient recommendations
- Features:
	- Privacy-protected environment (unlike public ChatGPT)
	- Handles complex medical record processing (750MB average size)
	- Provides personalized communication based on patient psychographics
	- Closes feedback loop with health records

### Therapeutic Area Example: Heart Failure

- 4 guideline-directed medical therapies (GDMT):
	- ACE inhibitor
	- Diuretics
	- RB
	- SGLT-2 inhibitor (added 2022)
- Key statistics:
	- 6.2M heart failure patients in US
	- 99% not treated to guideline
	- 40,000 patients/day leave doctor’s office with wrong recommendation
	- <20% of eligible patients on SGLT-2 inhibitor
- Implementation strategies:
	- Direct to patients/caregivers
	- Partnerships with stroke centers and healthcare organizations
	- Integration with existing health apps

### Commercial & Fundraising

- Revenue model: Per patient per ad cycle
	- Range: $500-$7,500 per engagement
	- Varies by therapeutic area (e.g., prostate cancer $250K-800K lifetime value)
- Fundraising target: $1.5M-$5M (flexible on final amount)

### Next Steps

- Emre to:
	- Review deck with Sean within 48 hours
	- Schedule 60-minute follow-up call if interested
	- Send 10 questions to guide next discussion
- Joris to share Boehringer Ingelheim deck specific to heart failure
