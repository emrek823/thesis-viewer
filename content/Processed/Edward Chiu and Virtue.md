### Edward’s Background & Company Origin

- Nerve damage after taking couple pills of ciprofloxacin (common antibiotic)
	- Lost functions in hand and leg with constant tingling sensation across all limbs
	- Best doctors in NYC and New York Presbyterian had no solutions
	- Asked ChatGPT - gave same clinical answers as doctors (basically take gabapentin)
	- Wife did everything because he couldn’t function
	- Read thousands of stories, articles, comments from 1999-2020
	- Found common patterns among people who healed from nerve damage
	- One month later burning sensation dissipated, four months later regained all strength
- Built social health network that aggregates every patient story and user story in real-time
	- Vision: become de facto community for health with largest real-time population health data
	- Self-reported efficacy data can power payers, providers, research organizations, clinical trials
	- Torch and TMV led $3M on $15M pre-seed in March
	- Many investors said don’t build consumer, don’t do social health network, no one will post about health publicly

### Product & Early Traction

- Private small beta launched couple weeks ago to learn about users
	- Unexpectedly hit #2 on App Store Health and Wellness section
	- Thousands of public logs from people sharing what works/doesn’t work
	- Covers everything from PCOS to type 1 diabetes to anxiety to gut motility
- Core product flow:
	- Tell us what you’re dealing with - we read thousands of comments and watch hundreds of videos for you
	- Neatly package information, heavily weighted towards clinical backing
	- Scan PubMed and NIH to pair with community health data
	- Purposefully didn’t launch filters on community side - wanted to see raw user interaction
- Real-time conversation matching launching soon
	- AI scanning own data feed in real-time
	- Suggested questions to filter out specific details (milligrams, routines, timing)
	- In 2 weeks already amassed thousands of data points
- Current user behavior metrics:
	- Most people: “scan this for me and let me go about my day”
	- 60% didn’t notice there was a feed (fixing this)
	- 600 illnesses covered, 350 activated
	- 60% of logged items were non-supplements (foods, routines, exercises, devices)
- Data strategy: Optional automation if users provide demographic, lifestyle, wearable, blood work data
	- Can scroll/read/digest community threads without sharing data
	- More data = better automated recommendations

### Business Strategy & Fundraising

- Last company was B2B - took unstructured data from Snowflake, RedShift, BigQuery and structured it
	- Team already building dashboard to make sense of current data
	- Will test with different healthcare organizations
- Four key focus areas for next 6-9 months:
	- Move users from scan/read → full lifecycle health management
		- Blood work and health portal integration
		- Wearable integration
		- Automated concierge recommendations
	- Collection and structuring of data for providers/payers
		- Segmentation by gender, race
		- Self-opt milligrams, dosing, timing details
	- Branded partnerships
		- Products above efficacy/safety threshold unlock branded accounts
		- Annual fee for brands to manage pages
		- Example: Eight Sleep as branded product under cold therapy for sleep
	- Nailing and owning community as singular dominant player
- Fundraising: $4-7M round, mid to end stage
	- Multiple co-leads potentially coming together
	- Two funds considering leading entire round
	- Torch and TMV want to double down from inside
	- Decision by end of next week latest
