Oak Street Leverages Value-Based Contracts with Medicare Advantage Plans to
Capture the Value Created by Improving Care Quality and Patient Outcomes

1.  Oak Street enters into globally capitated or full risk contracts with MA plans or with CMS (via Direct Contracting) to receive a percentage of each members' monthly premium ("PMPM")
    *   Payments are adjusted on a per patient basis to reflect patient health conditions
    *   OSH data and analytics capabilities increase accuracy, which can be reflected in a higher PMPM
2.  Delivery of the right care in the right setting can greatly impact outcomes and reduce costs associated with ED visits, hospital readmissions and other avoidable high-cost episodes
3.  OSH makes significant investments beyond ordinary primary care in direct patient costs via its comprehensive care model
    *   Investment in welcoming centers, interdisciplinary care teams, purpose-built technology and a differentiated approach to care delivery create the OSH platform
4.  Sustainable, predictable unit economics

## Slide 7: Near-term: Unengaged Members Hurt a Plan's Bottom Line

Near-term: Unengaged Members Hurt a Plan's Bottom Line

Zocalo has seen XX% of Latino MA members are “unengaged" (e.g., no HRA or AWV in last year)

Unengaged members...
- Impact the ability to accurately risk adjust patients
- Reduce quality scores
- Hurt enrollment and retention of patients (especially for plans outside of the Big 4)

## Slide 11: 3 to 4-star rating improvement can drive 8-12% increase in enrollment

3 to 4-star rating improvement can drive 8-12% increase in enrollment

"Analysis found that a 1 star increase in rating was associated with an 8 percent to 12 percent increase in beneficiary enrollment in the year following the increase. This increase was independent of overall changes in enrollment (i.e., the change would be in addition to overall county level changes in enrollment)."
