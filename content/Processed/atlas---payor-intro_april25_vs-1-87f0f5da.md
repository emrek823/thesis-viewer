## Slide 3: The Problem: Cancer spend is massive and growing rapidly, yet the principal influencers of care are not incentivized to manage cost and quality

### Payers have more exposure to cancer spend than ever; oncology is a burning platform
#### Monthly Total Medical Cost of Care (2021 Avg. Patient vs. Actively Managed Cancer Patients)
| Category         | Medicare FFS: Avg. Patient | Medicare FFS: Avg. Actively Managed Cancer Patient (1) | Commercial: Avg. Patient | Commercial: Avg. Actively Managed Cancer Patient (1) |
| :--------------- | :------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------- |
| **Monthly Cost** | $950                       | $2,114 (2.2x)                                          | $500                     | $4,877 (9.7x)                                        |

### Treating cancer patients is increasingly complex and long term in nature
- Medical oncologists actively manage patients for multiple years, in most cases replacing PCP
- Paradigm shift requires new approaches to clinical care and moving away from short-term, transactional incentive models

#### Month Since First Cancer Diagnosis (PCP vs. ONC Patient Management)
*This graph illustrates the percentage of patients being managed by a PCP or ONC over 48 months since their first cancer diagnosis.*
- **PCP (orange line):** Starts around 47% at -6 months, drops sharply to below 10% by month 2, then gradually declines and stabilizes around 25-30% from month 10 onwards.
- **ONC (blue line):** Starts around 5% at -6 months, rises sharply to around 40% by month 2, then continues to slowly rise and stabilizes around 30-35% from month 10 onwards.
- **Crossover Point:** The lines cross between month 8 and 10, where ONC management becomes more prevalent than PCP management.

**(1) Patients with actively managed cancer have metastatic cancer or non-metastatic cancer with treatment and have at least 1 E&M visit with oncologist every 18 months. Source: MFFS Claims set, Milliman and Merative MarketScan.**

## Slide 4: The only oncology platform partnering with physicians to deliver value-based care and guaranteed MLR impact

*This slide presents a 2x2 matrix categorizing different approaches based on "Physician engagement" (Y-axis) and "Value-based care focus" (X-axis).*

### Large aggregators
- **Logos:** One Oncology™, The US Oncology Network
- Traditional volume-oriented MSO approach wherein value-based care would be one service line among many to repair income scrape.

### Atlas
- **Logo:** Atlas oncology
- The only oncology care company focused on value-based care in partnership with physicians

### Specialty Benefit Managers
- **Logos:** AIM Specialty Health, OncoHealth, evicore healthcare by Evernorth, New Century Health
- Top-down payer solution to manage utilization of oncology drugs, costly for payers and creates friction for providers

### Care management vendors
- **Logos:** Thyme Care, Jasper
- Oriented to value-based care (though historically with less than full risk). Payors are the primary client with physician alignment and engagement a secondary consideration.

*Privileged & Confidential*

## Slide 5: Our Solution: Serve as “market maker” to bring the right resources and payment model to deliver a high-touch, concierge patient experience for little/no copay

### What We Deliver to Provider Partner
- Partner with medical oncology practices to offer a set of enhanced services to eligible patients
- Allow oncologists to extend their team, giving greater leverage and a better patient experience
- Act as an "internal referral" within the practice white-labeled to patient
- Hire, manage, and fund all incremental staff and infrastructure
- Share meaningful economics with practices

### Atlas oncology (Logo)

### What We Deliver to Payor Partner
- Enter into contracts with payors to manage the medical spend of their members with cancer
- Create aligned incentives between payor and provider
- Paid a monthly care management fee to fund our operations with provider
- Generate shared savings surplus from improving outcomes and lowering spend
- Member enjoys these enhanced services for very little out of pocket

## Slide 6: First, we align incentives: “Medical home” risk model for cancer patients

| Differentiated Approach   | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

|                           | - Scope of spend managed is total medical cost of care for attributed lives (not including pharmacy)                                                                                                                                   |
| **Broad Eligibility**     | - Attribution triggered by active engagement with Provider partner                                                                                                                                                                     |
|                           | - Includes adult patients with metastatic or non-metastatic cancer (having received or receiving treatment)                                                                                                                            |
|                           | - All cancer types in scope; limited clinical exclusions (ESRD, transplant, CAR-T, select drugs)                                                                                                                                       |

|                           | - Provider partner and Atlas split shared savings; Atlas provides downside protection                                                                                                                                                  |
|                           | - Value contract remains independent of FFS payer contracts                                                                                                                                                                            |

## Slide 7: How we work with health plans: Deal Structure

### Structure
*Diagram illustrating the deal structure:*
- **Top Layer:**
    - Capitated Provider
    - MA / Commercial Plan
- **Middle Layer:**
    - Risk Contract (connects Capitated Provider and MA / Commercial Plan)
    - Armada Oncology IPA (RBE) (receives from Risk Contract)
- **Bottom Layer:**
    - Existing FFS Contracts (connects to Participation and Collaboration Agreements)
    - Participation and Collaboration Agreements (connects Armada Oncology IPA (RBE) and Oncology Provider Partner)
    - Oncology Provider Partner (receives from Participation and Collaboration Agreements)

### How this Works

#### Atlas' Role
- Partner with oncology practices within payor network
- Provide enhanced services for all eligible members seen at practice
- Form an RBE and enter into VBC contract with payor
- Share 50/50 surplus with provider partner

#### Payor Economic Structure: 2 Parts
1.  **Monthly care management fee** paid to Atlas to fund cost of model
2.  **Total medical cost of care risk contract** for attributed patients flowing through partner practices
    -   MA: Full risk MLR model with savings guarantee
    -   Commercial: As above OR pay for performance, depending on payor appetite, operational capacity

## Slide 8: How we work with providers: Operating approach maintains practice infrastructure while offering a modular approach to deliver enhanced services

*REFINED WITH PRACTICES DURING COLLABORATIVE DILIGENCE*

### Operating Model

- Ongoing support by nurse/care coordinator dyad (Performed by Nurse/Care coordinator dyad)

## Slide 10: Current geographic focus in Gulf South region

### Market Focus
- Our launch payer contract covers a four-state footprint: TN, AL, LA, MS
- Priority serviceable market = community groups
- Launching in Summer 2025 with community practice in Memphis (under contract)
- "Platform" term sheets out covering 4 additional practices across LA, AL (priority), TX, NC (fast follows)
- Additional exploratory engagement across these states and others in earlier stages
- Notably, targeting practices across regions who serve patient populations outside of major metropolitan areas

### Map of Gulf South Region
*A map showing four states highlighted:*
- TN (Tennessee)
- AL (Alabama)
- MS (Mississippi)
- LA (Louisiana)

## Slide 11: We are actively building operations for our “Anchor Provider Launch Partner”

### Partner Snapshot
- Diversified community oncology practice that provides comprehensive care (med, rad, surg)
- Covers expansive territory across urban, suburban, and rural western TN, northern MS, eastern AR
- 11 clinics with one "mothership" in Memphis
- 113 providers incl. 25 medical oncologists
- Current EOM participant
- Known in industry as top tier for innovation in and delivering clinical excellence

### Current Status: Building for Summer 2025 Go-Live
- Multi-year contract executed
- Finalizing care model components for launch (OncoPCP Suite and Triage) vs. fast follow (Palliative Care)
- Aligning on recruiting and hiring plan for local clinical team
- Securing clinic and local office space
- Configuring tech stack (OncoEMR <> Athena) and establishing data connectivity (Zus, Ursa)

## Slide 12: Impact: A Comprehensive Cancer Care Solution for Health Plans

### A differentiated cancer care asset
- Integrated and physician/practice-driven vs. point solution
- Squarely addresses top payor priorities to improve costs and outcomes

### An inclusive model that simplifies administration
- +80% of cancer patients included
- One model for all
- Mimics ACO structure
- Can sit under PCP capitated arrangements when risk has been delegated

### A solution that will deliver reduced cost
- Various levers exist to drive down cost of care for existing patient base
- Materially reduces downside exposure faced by payor
- Greater predictability of spend; especially critical given rising cancer spend trend

## Slide 13: Potential Next Steps
- Discuss partnership potential in Gulf
- Identify and discuss other priority markets
- Light data exchange to inform opportunity assessment
