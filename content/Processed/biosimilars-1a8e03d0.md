### Scientific Considerations in Demonstrating Biosimilarity to a Reference Product: Updated Recommendations for Assessing the Need for Comparative Efficacy Studies
#### Guidance for Industry¹

This draft guidance, when finalized, will represent the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.

### I. INTRODUCTION

This draft guidance describes considerations regarding a comparative clinical study or studies with efficacy endpoints (a “comparative efficacy study” or “CES”) to support a demonstration of biosimilarity in a biologics license application (BLA) submitted under section 351(k) of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act. Section 351(k) of the PHS Act (42 U.S.C. 262(k)) provides an abbreviated licensure pathway for biological products shown to be biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference product and sets forth the requirements for a BLA submitted under section 351(k) (a “351(k) BLA”). The sponsor of a proposed biosimilar product must, among other things, demonstrate that the proposed product is highly similar to the reference product, notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components, and that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the proposed product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency.² A 351(k) BLA must contain, among other things, information demonstrating that the biological product is biosimilar to a reference product based upon data derived from analytical studies, an assessment of toxicity, and a clinical study or studies,³ unless the Agency determines, in its discretion, that an element described in section 351(k)(2)(A)(i)(I) of the PHS Act is unnecessary in a 351(k) BLA.⁴ Although the 351(k) pathway generally applies to all biological products, this guidance focuses on therapeutic protein.

34 products, providing an overview of important scientific considerations for determining when a
CES may inform a demonstration of biosimilarity.5,⁶

In April 2015, the agency published the guidance for industry Scientific Considerations in
Demonstrating Biosimilarity to a Reference Product (April 2015) (Scientific Considerations
Guidance) which described, among other things, general considerations for comparative clinical
studies intended to support a demonstration that a proposed therapeutic protein product (for the
purposes of this guidance, these will be referred to as proposed product, proposed biosimilar, or
proposed biosimilar product) is biosimilar to a reference product for the purpose of submitting a
marketing application under section 351(k) of the PHS Act (42 U.S.C. 262(k)).⁷ The guidance
recommended that, as a scientific matter, a comparative clinical study will be necessary to
support a demonstration of biosimilarity if there is residual uncertainty about whether there are
clinically meaningful differences between the proposed product and the reference product based
on comparative analytical studies, an assessment of toxicity, comparative human PK and PD
studies (if there is a relevant PD measure(s)), and a clinical immunogenicity assessment. The
guidance also stated that a sponsor should provide a scientific justification if it believes that a
comparative clinical study is not necessary. Comparative clinical studies typically have been
designed to analyze and compare a clinical efficacy outcome or other relevant therapeutic effect
between the proposed product and the reference product.

Since the publication of the Scientific Considerations Guidance, the scientific approach to
determine the need for CES has evolved, and FDA has gained significant experience in
evaluating data from comparative analytical and clinical studies used to support a demonstration
of biosimilarity. Accordingly, FDA is issuing this draft guidance to describe an updated
framework for determining when a CES may not be necessary to support a demonstration of
biosimilarity.

In general, FDA’s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities.
Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only
as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of

When final, this guidance will represent FDA’s current thinking on this topic. For the most recent version of a
guidance, check the FDA guidance web page at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-
documents.

6 For recommendations regarding a switching study or studies intended to support a demonstration that a biological
product is interchangeable with a reference product, see the draft guidance for industry Considerations in
Demonstrating Interchangeability with a Reference Product: Update (June 2024) available at
https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents.

7 In this guidance, the following terms are used to describe biological products licensed under section 351(k) of the
PHS Act: (1) biosimilar or biosimilar product refers to a product that FDA has determined to be biosimilar to the
reference product (see sections 351(i)(2) and 351(k)(2) of the PHS Act); and (2) interchangeable biosimilar or
interchangeable product refers to a biosimilar product that FDA has determined to be interchangeable with the
reference product (see sections 351(i)(3) and 351(k)(4) of the PHS Act).

68     II.  DISCUSSION
69
70     Section 351 of the PHS Act sets forth the requirements for an applicant to demonstrate that a
71     biological product is biosimilar to a reference product.
72
73     An application submitted under section 351(k) of the PHS Act seeking licensure of a biological
74     product as biosimilar or interchangeable must contain, among other things, data from “a clinical
75     study or studies (including the assessment of immunogenicity and pharmacokinetics or
76     pharmacodynamics) that are sufficient to demonstrate safety, purity, and potency in [one] or
77     more appropriate conditions of use for which the reference product is licensed and intended to be
78     used and for which licensure is sought for the biological product[.]”⁸
79
80     FDA has gained significant experience in evaluating analytical differences between proposed
81     biosimilar products and their reference products and understanding the impact of those analytical
82     differences on clinical performance. ,9,¹⁰,¹¹ Moreover, currently available analytical technologies
83     can structurally characterize highly purified therapeutic proteins and model in vivo functional
84     effects with a high degree of specificity and sensitivity using in vitro biological and biochemical
85     assays. A comparative analytical assessment (CAA) is generally more sensitive than a CES to
86     detect differences between two products, should any exist, that may preclude a demonstration of
87     biosimilarity.¹²,¹³,¹⁴ The lack of sensitivity of a CES is potentially due to a number of factors,
88     such as therapeutic dose range selection that is commonly chosen to reach pharmacologic target
89     saturation and the therapeutic plateau, as well as characteristics of the clinical study population

90     chosen and primary endpoint selected (e.g., floor and ceiling effects). Accordingly, FDA’s
91     scientific approach is evolving as to when a CES may inform a demonstration of biosimilarity.
92
93     FDA recommends that sponsors carefully consider what clinical study(ies) would be necessary to
94     support a demonstration of biosimilarity when designing their development programs.
95
96     Generally, if the CAA supports a demonstration that the proposed biosimilar is highly similar to
97     its reference product, notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components, an
98     appropriately designed human pharmacokinetic similarity study and an assessment of
99     immunogenicity may be sufficient to evaluate whether there are clinically meaningful
100     differences between the proposed biosimilar and the reference product in terms of safety, purity,
101     and potency.¹⁵ In such an instance, FDA recommends that sponsors consider a streamlined
102     approach where a CES may not be necessary to support a demonstration of biosimilarity. The
103     adequacy of the data from a CAA, pharmacokinetic similarity data, and immunogenicity
104     assessment to support a demonstration of biosimilarity, would be evaluated based on the totality
105     of the evidence submitted in the biologics license application.
106
107     A streamlined approach should be considered when:
108
109      •  The reference product and proposed biosimilar product are manufactured from clonal cell
110         lines, are highly purified, and can be well-characterized analytically;
111
112      •  The relationship between quality attributes and clinical efficacy is generally understood
113         for the reference product, and these attributes can be evaluated by assays included in the
114         CAA; and
115
116      •  A human pharmacokinetic similarity study is feasible and clinically relevant.
117
118     We note there remain circumstances when a CES may inform a demonstration of biosimilarity,
119     e.g., for locally acting products such as intravitreally administered products where comparative
120     pharmacokinetics is not feasible or clinically relevant. Also, there may be circumstances where a
121     comparative clinical study with a clinically relevant endpoint other than an efficacy endpoint
122     may be useful to support a demonstration of biosimilarity. In both situations, sponsors are
123     encouraged to discuss their proposed approaches with the Agency early in product development
124     and prior to initiating clinical studies.
