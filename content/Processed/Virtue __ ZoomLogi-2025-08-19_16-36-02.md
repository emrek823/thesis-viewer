### Sales Pipeline Performance

- Highlights: couple more deals signed, good diversity in segments and customer size
- Lowlights:
	- Length of sales cycles major concern
		- Beacon: first meeting December, ~6 months to close
		- Cardinal: first meeting March, ~6 months timeline
	- Health systems conversations extremely slow
		- Yale New Haven Health wanting peer validation
		- Pharmacy leadership transitions causing delays
		- “Let’s reconnect later in the year” pattern
- Current focus: accelerating sales cycle in back half of year
	- Average cycle for recent pipeline (row 12 down): ~1.5-2 months
	- Zero case studies currently limiting pitch effectiveness

### Go-to-Market Strategy & Hiring Plans

- Accelerating sales hire timeline from January to now
- Target profile: Ryan archetype
	- ~10 years experience (2015 graduate)
	- Previously sold software to health systems/pharma
	- Mid-career, has Rolodex but high energy
	- $150K + incentives compensation
- Segmentation approach:
	- Health systems: hiring specialist who knows the ecosystem
		- Need to navigate CMO, CIO involvement
		- Relationship-driven sales (knows “Josie” contacts)
	- Pharma/wholesale distributors: leveraging existing advisors
- Goal: own entire segments vs. product-focused approach

### Product Development vs. Sales Focus Debate

- Current bottleneck: go-to-market, not product
- AI engineer hiring discussion:
	- Market pressure to hire “AI native engineers” at $200K + 2.5% equity
	- Internal view: can achieve 90% of value with existing team + ChatGPT/prompt engineering
	- Product already 10x better than Excel spreadsheets (main competition)
- Strategic decision: prioritize tactical BD hires over expensive engineers
	- Focus on proving market demand with existing V1 product
	- Use revenue growth to justify future technical investment

### Customer Segments & Conversion Strategy

- Pilot evolution: moving from free pilots to paid pilots
	- Cardinal: $5-8K/month paid pilot
	- Beacon: $4K/month paid pilot
- Health systems challenges:
	- Need peer validation before proceeding
	- Budget cycles and decision-maker complexity
	- VPL competitor analysis: relationship-driven, not tech-driven
- Pharma segment traction:
	- Multiple advisors added (former Novo Nordisk president, Accenture head of cell/gene therapy, Pfizer Europe transportation director)
	- Verily and Amber Life Sciences meetings scheduled

### Revenue Projections & Next Steps

- Q2 target: $1M+ ARR from Cardinal and Beacon ramp-up
- Strategy for 12 months:
	- Prove large enterprise + SMB can use same product
	- Show Cardinal expansion into additional divisions (Radiopharma)
	- Convert 5-10 more customers from current pipeline (10-20% conversion rate assumed)
- Focus on breadth across verticals while adding segment-specialist salespeople
- Timeline: test health systems specialist hire, if successful, apply model to other verticals
