## Slide 3

Enabling biopharma to move at the speed of software

Why haven’t we seen a new pharma giant in decades? The Mag7 is on average just 33 years old, yet most top biopharma were founded in the 1800s.

Biopharma has long required massive capital and expert networks, forcing biotechs into acquisition before reaching scale. That’s changing. As software takes on the role of experts, a new generation of AI-native pharma giants will emerge. These companies won’t run on legacy tech or rely on an army of consultants. 

They will operate on Solstice.

## Slide 8

Solstice is not just a platform, we recreate the white-glove experience biopharma is used to.

Model

Now…

All client interactions happen through Solstice’s platform.

Communicating strategy and marketing vision to platform directly is faster and easier than speaking with a person.

They can use the platform directly for simpler changes.
Clients prefer to communicate strategic vision with a Solstice commercial engagement lead to bring to their ideas to life for complex tasks.
The platform expedites content strategy execution.

Pharmaceutical marketers are used to communicating their ideas to humans.

15-20 people per client
$10-50k per digital piece (email, display)
 2+ months to execute on any asset

1 engagement lead per 5 clients
Zero variable costs per digital piece
Idea to MLR within an hour

Future…

LLMs make this uniquely possible now

Bayer pharma goes all-in for digital media buying, moving external operations in-house

Why Now

Biopharma wants to move things in-house and LLMs finally make it possible

$110k

$650k

$2.3m

$4m

*ARR at the start of each quarter

## Slide 11

Competition

Can’t build product or recruit good technical talent

Face the innovator’s dilemma. Will they disrupt their own business model?

Only solve a very small part of workflow, forcing biopharma to duct-tape the rest
Pharma likes pharma specific solutions (see Veeva)

This is a real threat 
Distracted by their battle with Salesforce
Very important for us to build our ecosystem outside of Veeva

…

We are the only technology built for pharma, without the baggage of an existing business model

Short-term we differentiate on product superiority through  our sophisticated compliance-first workflow

Long-term we differentiate by becoming a system of  record that houses real data on content and how it performs as well as through our brand and relationships.

## Slide 12

GTM

We can get to $50mm ARR just with just our current clients and current product

(More products)

(More brands)

It’s a race to the Top 20 logos
