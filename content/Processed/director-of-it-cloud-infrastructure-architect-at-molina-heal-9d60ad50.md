## Expert Details
Director of IT Cloud Infrastructure Architect at Molina Healthcare Inc, a customer of Autonomize AI The expert can speak to being a customer of Autonomize AI

Director of IT Cloud Infrastructure Architect at Molina Healthcare Inc. Reporting to the VP of Cloud Infrastructure, the expert is responsible for managing the infrastructure for claims processing, payment integrity, claims adjudication, and platforms within Molina such as azure, cloud etc.

**Q: Are you a customer or have you evaluated Anterior (fka Co:Helm) or Autonomize AI?**
**A: Customer - Autonomize AI**

## Client
Hi. We will be discussing the prior authorization space and saw that you were a customer of Autonomize. Let's start with your background.

## Expert
I'm the director for IT on the prepay and post-pay for payment integrity. I'm overseeing all of the prepay and post-pay vendors, all of the nightly and operational type of work that goes into that, and receiving the files and response files from our vendors, along with a lot of our AI efforts around this area too, which include a lot of the claims examination for post-pay, and then even some prepay activities as well.

## Client
Got it. Could you explain to me what those, just for some context, I don't have a ton of context around what the day-to-day workflows are. Maybe if you could just talk me through, what does a typical day look like? What are the manual workflows that are involved?

## Expert
Sure. As far as manual workflows, so typical day. Let's start there. Typical day would be we have multiple vendors that we deal with for prepay, which run nightly as part of our post MAS activities. Basically sending the prepaid vendors data, and then we get the response file back from them and take decisions on payment basically on a nightly basis. That's within a certain window in our nightly batch window.

Our post-pay activity, which could take up to a day or two. That's obviously after everything is paid, what kind of recommendations we get back from these vendors on that as well. Manual work really resides mostly on the post-pay activity. If there's something that needs to be reviewed or recommendations show, deny, we have manual work that's done there.

## Client
How many people are in your department and how many people are involved in doing all of these processes?

## Expert
In my area we have 50 or so on the IT side. On the business side, for payment integrity, we have close to 200 folks.

## Client
Is that divided on the business side? Is that nurses and clinicians who are reviewing the claims?

## Expert
No, these are claims examiners. That's the role that we have for them. It's not really a nurse or a physician or anyone doing any of that stuff. This is more of just someone who understands the rules for each state. We have multiple states, health plans. Somebody who understands those rules and can manually look at a claim and understand why a recommendation is being done and then do a final review and approve.

## Client
Interesting. It's more about that there are so many nuances and differences in rules between different states.

## Expert
Correct.

## Client
Okay. You said there's 50 people on your team on the IT side. What are you guys doing? You mentioned the prepay and post-pay vendors, but could you talk me through what's actually happening? Somebody for example, they break their leg and then they need to get surgery. Their doctor says to them, "Okay, we want to get you this leg surgery. We're going to put the prior auth claim in to the healthcare plan," and then what happens on your side?

## Expert
For prior auth, there's the diagnosis codes that are reviewed based on the health plan and then we get recommendations again from our vendors to whether to move forward or not. If there is a denial, then it goes to our claims examiner person to her group to go ahead and do final approval.

## Client
Got it. Maybe we could then chat through Autonomize. How did you find out about them? What made you decide to buy the platform?

## Expert
Autonomize was introduced to us by a vendor that we worked with very closely and they're our primary along with another AI solution vendor that we work with. It was introduced through a primary partner that we work with in technology.

## Client
Awesome. What was the need that they were solving? What was the problem that you guys had that made you want to buy them?

## Expert
It started with the ChatGPT function of basically one, we had a huge need for document search and retrieval and summarization of data. Like I said, the claim examiners before they would have to go in and go through and sift through thousands of documents for different policies and rules by health plan to do their due diligence and homework on this stuff. With Autonomize, ChatGPT, we're using it for the same. Examiners are now just able to type in a basic question like a ChatGPT function and it returns and summarizes the data nicely for them and quickly where they would have to maybe spend hours going through documents you're getting them in seconds.

## Client
Got it. It's more you're saying they're state specific. Could you give me an example of the question that they would ask?

## Expert
Yeah, like your example in the broken leg. Can you tell me what benefits are there for a senior citizen that has broken leg in Ohio with these conditions, diabetes and so forth? It will go ahead and spit it back out. A summarization. While in Ohio this is what it's covered, but it's not covered for this, and in case of this, it gives all the conditions, everything summarizes it.

## Client
Okay, super cool. Once you have that answer, is there anything else that you're using Autonomize for or is it more just to ask those questions?

## Expert
Right now it's just that.

## Client
Are you thinking about using it for anything else? Are there other areas that you would expand into?

## Expert
We're looking at some automation around our file intake. We have files that we receive from vendors like rate sheet files to update our rates for pricing. That's a bi-weekly process that takes some time to do it manually. We're looking at Autonomize to help us with not only just receiving the file from the vendor and then applying but also doing test validation steps that a human would normally do.

## Client
Interesting. This rate sheet, the pricing, can you tell me more about why does it change every two weeks?

## Expert
This is like an ever-changing process based on the health plans and so forth. They have different rules that come in and then they have different nuances that will change a price on a certain procedure, or what have you, based on diagnosis codes and so forth. It's basically a service that we pay for that will save us money as staying up to date with the rate sheet changes and recommendations.

## Client
Got it. You said it takes time to do this manually, what would they be doing that makes it faster?

## Expert
It would be more of an intake process. The file is sent to us from the vendor. The AI agent in this case, we're going to use an agent to pick up the file move like a file watcher. When it arrives in a location, as expected, it will pick up that file. It'll apply it to our system in a lower environment and then start the testing and validation on its own and doing some pre-checks. Does this look like the right data? Is it comparable to the last file? All that stuff. Put some rules in there in the workflow and then finally when it gets done with that, it will go to a person. By that time a lot of the pre-checks are done.

## Client
That's really helpful. Could you tell me about it sounds like you got introduced to them through a vendor that you work with, but did you look at any other companies that were doing something similar? You mentioned it's similar to ChatGPT. Did you guys try using ChatGPT? I'm curious about the other competitors.

## Expert
Sure. We tried using Enso. I don't know if you have heard of Enso. That didn't work as well as Autonomize, so we settled with Autonomize on that one.

## Client
Okay. Do they offer exactly the same thing?

## Expert
Yeah, they offer similar solutions.

## Client
Cool. What about a company called Anterior? Have you heard of them and have you tried using them at all?

## Expert
No, I'm not familiar with that one.

## Client
Okay. They used to be called Co:Helm. Maybe that rings more of a bell. As far as I'm aware, they're still developing their product, so I think they're just talking with healthcare plans. They haven't really actually started selling yet. What about ChatGPT?

## Expert
You mean like Microsoft?

## Client
Yeah. Or just using OpenAI directly. Like just using ChatGPT directly.

## Expert
Yeah. We leveraged ChatGPT through Azure Microsoft. We've levered that OpenAI, haven't had too much success just on the basic stuff. Probably the most advantageous solution we've got out of there is we got a fax-scanning AI capability through Azure that actually scans the documents and translates the human writing into text. Not so much a ChatGPT, but more of a scanning option.

## Client
I see. More like next-gen OCR kind of stuff. It's like here's the image.

## Expert
Image recognition.

## Client
Got it. That's so helpful because so much of the prior auth work is all fax?

## Expert
Exactly. They're still using faxes, but yeah.

## Client
That's crazy.

## Expert
It's able to read doctors' writing, which was surprising.

## Client
Super cool. In your opinion, because you're working in IT, do you see the LLMs getting better at this kind of stuff and being able to actually do this versus Autonomize? Do you think if ChatGPT gets better over time they would be able to do the same capability?

## Expert
I think so. I think it's been a marathon for the last two years since this thing hit. I've seen improvements with ChatGPT where they're catching up with a lot of the vendors. The Autonomizes of the world, they boxed up their solutions, put a little bow on top of it. There's still definitely work to do with Autonomize as far as you just can't use it right out of the box type of thing. Obviously there's a lot of prompt engineering involved with if you're going to ask to do a ChatGPT type of solution and then Microsoft is always coming out with their new versions and so forth. It's becoming more intuitive and so forth for OpenAI. I think it is catching up.

## Client
Interesting. Do you feel Autonomize is a bit of a wrapper?

## Expert
It is.

## Client
Okay, that's really helpful. Have they shown you anything on the roadmap that makes you excited that you're like, "Oh, wow, this seems like pretty differentiated kind of stuff or it's like super deep"? Are there any workflows that they're doing that it's maybe like outside of all the new age AI stuff, but they deeply know your workflows and you feel like, "Oh, that's adding a ton of value"? A more generic LLM would struggle to be able to put all these extra workflows in place?

## Expert
So far, it's very typical of just generic. Nothing specific for our company, but it's been very generic. A lot of the ML stuff that they're showing on the roadmap and it's pretty typical. Nothing specific for us.

## Client
Do you feel like there's anything any of these verticalized vendors could do that would really wow you that you're like, "Oh, yeah, if they do this, then that's really worth paying for and if we would stick it out for the long term?"

## Expert
I think they have yet to show us, but if it's anything around our efficiencies in mass operations, I think that's a void right now. They're trying to catch up on that because every healthcare company, they conduct their operations and structure it differently.

## Client
What was the efficiency in their mass?

## Expert
Mass adjudication.

## Client
Map?

## Expert
Mass adjudication.

## Client
Okay, what's that?

## Expert
Yeah, basically claims adjudication process.

## Client
Got it.

## Expert
We process millions and millions of claims nightly. That's a pain point for us in the window that we do it and then operating with our users, getting everything done by the time the users get in. That's always a pain point, but, yeah.

## Client
Got it. You said that they haven't necessarily shown you anything there that would be really helpful for you.

## Expert
That would be something that we've been talking to them about, but there's nothing that came up as far as some strong solution that they've come up with yet.

## Client
Okay. That's like a top wish list thing.

## Expert
Yeah. There you go.

## Client
That's really cool. I guess just like an NPS score. A score of 1-10, 10 being the best, one being the worst, how good is Autonomize? Do you think you'll continue using them in the future? Do you think you would upsell your contract or stay the same or down-sell? Just some context would be great.

## Expert
I would rate them a 7.5. We are going to continue with them. I think so far so good type of thing. The engagement's only been maybe a year and a half now. I think it's positive.

## Client
Okay, super cool. What would bring you up to like an eight or a nine or a 10?

## Expert
I think just being maybe engaging closer with, like I said, some of our key or critical processes like claim adjudication and reducing the manual work there, optimizing it to shorten our window, maybe throughput processing more claims per minute, that kind of stuff. All those critical key areas that we're struggling with. I think if they can engage themselves there more, we would probably get to a nine. That kind of stuff.

## Client
Super cool. How are they on customer service and responsiveness?

## Expert
Pretty good. There are no issues there.

## Client
What do they do super well?

## Expert
I think their pre-sale team as far as solutioning have a pretty strong team in that area. As far as when we gather our requirements and then having them solution up different options and very transparent with the price tags, I think that's been appreciated.

## Client
That's super helpful. How about professional services? How much is this platform something that you guys just use by yourself versus do you have people on their side help your people to be able to work through it and answer questions and do the prompt engineering?

## Expert
We definitely leverage them for PS work for our area because internally we don't have a lot of experience, so we use them for either training or professional services and in different areas depending on the solution. We do use them for that.

## Client
Super cool. What does that involve? Is that like do you have a dedicated customer support person or is there some more heavy engineering? Is it quite customized to you guys?

## Expert
It's really project based. It's more like SOW type of work. If we let professional services for six months or for XYZ solution and if we need them for another six months, we'll do so. It's more on SOW type of term.

## Client
Got it. What would that entail? Could you give me an example of what would be one of these projects?

## Expert
It would be like just for the document search that I mentioned. Prompt engineering working with as we release the product and then there's professional services that will come in when maybe the answers are not coming as expected. We have to use prompt engineering tactics on a certain degree of how it's answering the question and then work with the business on saying, "Okay, is this what you're looking for?" Doing some more testing and fine tuning basically solutions with their professional services help.

## Client
I see. It might be basically that it's not working totally. You are like, "Hey, let's spend six months really focusing on the prompt engineering and the fine tuning."

## Expert
Yes, that's a good example.

## Client
That's awesome. I know we've got two minutes left and there's one question I'm just trying to remember. Is there anything else that you'd say about them that you feel like is important that I've missed out on?

## Expert
I think we covered everything. They're a good partner for us. My overall is positive as I mentioned and so far so good type of thing.

## Client
Sorry, I remembered. They're basically operating system or middle layer orchestration between all of the different processes that you guys do to being able to basically have an OS between all of these different siloed prior auth claims adjudication, letters, all of that kind of stuff. Is that something that's useful to you guys? Does it feel very differentiated?

## Expert
No, a lot of the solutions that we get from them, they packaged up and we're able to deploy within our domain. It's like a path, like a platform as a service type of solution. We don't have to go with SaaS. That is an option, but we prefer to have everything in-house for security reasons.

## Client
Awesome. I think we're on time now. Thank you so much. Really appreciate all of your thoughts here.
