## Summary
The Tegus Client speaks with the Vice President of Clinical Affairs at Sonex Health about their experience with Mural Health and their involvement in the clinical trial process. Sonex Health is a current customer of Mural Health and has signed a four-year deal for two studies. They initially used Ledger Run and Tango Card for participant payments but switched to Mural Health due to a negative experience. Sonex Health is developing a surgical instrument for carpal tunnel release and plans to expand their portfolio with other devices. They anticipate running four to six trials over the next eight to ten years, with most trials being two-year follow-ups. The trial is a hybrid model, with 88% of the data collected remotely. Mural Health is suitable for both centralized and decentralized models and has a payment system that keeps patients engaged in long-term studies. Patient feedback is limited to vocal patients, and research coordinators play a crucial role in building relationships with patients. Sonex Health has implemented a system where patients are paid within 24 hours of submitting data, which has been well-received. Mural Health offers payment flexibility compared to Greenphire, with various payment options available. The issue of lost payment cards can lead to fraud, and transportation options are now provided by Mural Health and Greenphire through integrated mobile apps. Mural Health's accounting tracking and reporting capabilities have been helpful for site and patient payments. Greenphire's lack of urgency and responsiveness in obtaining a quote is disappointing. Recruitment and retention are significant challenges in clinical trials, particularly for start-ups. Sonex Health has found time savings, speed to market, and cost savings with patients through Mural Health. They value patient retention and have seen a significant reduction in patient attrition rates with the use of Mural Health.

**Tegus Client**
Hello. Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today about the clinical trial software space. Specifically, we want to talk about solutions around participant payments, participant transportation and participant communication. We understand you have some experience with Mural Health. Just to confirm upfront, are you a current customer at Mural? How long have you been a customer?

**Vice President of Clinical Affairs at Sonex Health**
I am. We started talking with them in August of last year and signed contract in June of this year. And we've just signed a four year deal with them for two studies.

**Tegus Client**
Awesome. What was the difference or change from the contract in June versus the four year deal? Did you just roll them out on one study, or what did that initial contract look like?

**Vice President of Clinical Affairs at Sonex Health**
There's two studies. So to understand the background of our company, in particular, we're a post-market product that is a Class 1 device. When I joined Sonex Health in January of 2022, we thought we would only have to do two studies to apply for our own CPT code. So it really had to do around reimbursement. So we had two studies. One was an RCT, and we did payments through Ledger Run.

We used Ledger Run in collaboration with Tango Card. That experience was so tough, and we've just had so much bad patient feedback on how that rolled out. And there was no tracking with Tango Card. It just ended up being a nightmare and making sure all the patients were paid. And patient retention was super important for that study because it only had 122 patients in it for long term.

So for our second study, which was a single-arm, in-office study, 149 patients, we had started with Ledger Run and Tango Card and started running right into the same problem. So we, at that point, decided to pivot within the first two months of the study being live. We took bids from Greenphire, Mural Health, and I think there was one other one, but it didn't make it very long. But it was really between Mural Health and Greenphire. So we pivoted and chose Mural Health.

We moved all of our patients mid-study over to Mural Health payment and our site payments to them through Mural Health in June of this year. And then we are starting a 2,000-patient registry with two year follow-up up to 50 sites, and the first patient will be enrolled in January. And for that study, we signed up solely with Mural Health.

**Tegus Client**
Got it. Can you tell us a little bit more about Sonex Health? My understanding is you've developed a surgical instrument.

**Vice President of Clinical Affairs at Sonex Health**
We did. Sonex Health is an orthopedic hand surgery company. What's interesting about Sonex Health is the two company founders that started the company, Jay Smith, and Darryl Barnes, they are physicians from Mayo in New York. I think one is a sports medicine doctor, and Jay is a PM&R doctor.

So neither of which were surgeons, but they are very much entrepreneurs in devices and how to make procedures less invasive, and office space is really their focus. Jay Smith is a world-renowned expert in ultrasound.

So as they started comparing different procedures that were out there that could be moved from an OR or ASC to an office space to be a much more patient-friendly environment, they started leaning in and looking at carpal tunnel release. So carpal tunnel release today gets about 2.2 million diagnoses a year. And only 500,000 or 600,000, I think is the latest number, a year actually go on to surgery.

So what happens to the remaining 1.7 million patients? Where are they sitting? So that's what they were trying to figure out. From their research, what they were looking at is what it seems to be is that the most popular way to do carpal tunnel release in patients is an incision in the palm.

It's a three to five centimeter incision right down the middle of the palm. The surgeon goes in and clips the carpal tunnel ligament, stitches it up and the full healing amount takes about three months. They do them unilaterally. So if you have carpal tunnel in both hands, they'll do one, wait for it to fully heal, and then they'll do the second one.

So anybody undergoing that's going to spend a year in the healing pathway. Our device itself is a minimally invasive and almost, say, percutaneous. We have a two to four centimeter incision at the base of the crease of the wrist. And it comes up underneath the carpal tunnel ligament, which you're using ultrasound on top of the palm to see your landmarks and give you the visibility that you would normally get.

**Tegus Client**
Got it. And how is Sonex involved in the clinical trial process? You mentioned at the outset you thought you'd only need to run two clinical trials. So, is this the type of situation where you'll be a lifetime customer always running trials, or you only have to run a handful, and then you're done?

**Vice President of Clinical Affairs at Sonex Health**
We're having a conversation internally because of this space. Ultrasound has played such a bigger role in, not only in orthopedics, but in a lot of different areas, where we lean more and more to less invasive diagnostic opportunities that we have the opportunity to be a portfolio company and not a one-trick pony.

And this is my eighth medical device start-up. So this is what I typically focus in on. It's usually benched to that side. Once we get FDA approval, I move on to the next one. In the last two companies, NxThera, which was bought by Boston, where I ended up going to work for a while. And Sonex, I think, really lend themselves to be portfolio.

If ultrasound is your visualization device, what else could we do around it? So we have a second device at Sonex called trigger finger. So the TFR, trigger finger release, we have trigger thumb, and we are looking at other indications.

So instead of really positioning ourselves to be an acquisition, it really makes sense for us to be a more attractive portfolio company because there truly isn't a true acquiring company that fits for us. This is because we use ultrasound, and we use the disposable device.

**Tegus Client**
Got it. So what implication does that have on the number of trials that you'd be running with, say, a Mural Health moving forward?

**Vice President of Clinical Affairs at Sonex Health**
So I think it's a bit of a pivot. When I joined Sonex, when you will apply for your own CPT code you need five publications. And none of those five publications can have the same authors or the same patient data set, and one has to be an RCT.

So when I joined Sonex, they had three publications already, and they needed two more. They needed an RCT, and they needed an in-office. If we were going to move it from a surgery suite to an office, we needed in-office data to show that it was efficacious and safe as the gold standards today in an office.

So those are the two studies. I have the dream team on clinical. I thought we would be here four years. We're going to run the studies and be out. We'll sell the company. But the more we've leaned in, the more I've learned about it. This space, in particular, is really ripe for more technology.

So when that happens, you pivot as a clinical decision-maker of, “Hey, are you building the team to really be a tiger team to knock this out and move on, or do you really want to have to build your own infrastructure?" So at Sonex, we don't use a CRO. We have built our own clinical team and our own data management team, and that is growing over time.

With that, the thought process is for each product you bring in, you're going to do the set of studies that you will need to have your own CPT code for every indication. So that means three to five studies every device that you do. So this is a long-term build for us. So we anticipate the Mural Health relationship to be long term.

**Tegus Client**
Makes sense. So at that cadence, do you have a rough sense for about how many trials you run in a given year?

**Vice President of Clinical Affairs at Sonex Health**
Right now, we have four. I think between when they close and open up, we're going to be somewhere between four and six over the remaining eight to 10 years.

**Tegus Client**
Got it. And these are multiyear trials, is that correct?

**Vice President of Clinical Affairs at Sonex Health**
Correct. They're a two year follow-up, most of them.

**Tegus Client**
Got it. And in terms of phase, what phase are these in?

**Vice President of Clinical Affairs at Sonex Health**
Well, this is a strange part for me, and it's new to me. Most of my career, I've spent in the premarket space. So it's odd to be a Class 1 or Class 1 exemption or even a 1 with de novo. But being post market, these are all seen as post-market Phase IV studies just for the sense that we are doing them after we've gotten full approval.

It's an odd space. Now we look at what the level of evidence ends up really being. So RCT for us is a level evidence two, and a comparative two arm study is a level evidence three. It's less about phasing because we're a post market.

**Tegus Client**
Makes sense. And are these centralized, decentralized, hybrid?

**Vice President of Clinical Affairs at Sonex Health**
Well, let me tell you, this has been the biggest eye-opener since I've been here. So when I went to Boston Scientific in 2018, the company I was with was acquired, I moved into urology and ran their studies for about a year there. And right after that, I wanted to do something and really understand how Boston ran studies better and really look at all of the six divisions.

So I moved into corporate clinical about three months before the pandemic hit. And moving into my global clinical position, what was interesting at that time was we had 151 ongoing clinical studies at Boston when the pandemic hit. I would say 95% of our studies were devices we were studying were we required the patients to come back in, but it was an elective procedure. And suddenly, all the offices were shut down.

So what I spent two years at Boston doing is looking at how do we ensure that as a company, we were never going to be in the same spot again where we challenged or that we put our investment for a clinical study at risk due to patients not being able to go back in the office. So we did a 20-vendor RFP, knocked it down to four vendors, and Viedoc was our winner for e-studies, ePRO if we decided to lean in.

While I was still at Boston, we rolled it out for PMCF for post-market surveys to get clinical data in Europe on devices where we had acquired a company, but they hadn't run their own data. They were pointing through their 510(k) application to a competitor's device, and we were now required to have our own clinical data. So we're kicking the tires or testing it on PMCF.

When Bob Paulson called me, the CEO for Sonex, he was also the CEO for NxThera where I worked before. And he called me and said to me, "This is an easy one for you. If you could take your knowledge of ePRO and bring it here to Sonex, this would kill." I went in and talked to them, and totally agree.

So I was still skeptical about how much could you decentralize the trial, worried a lot about it. I will tell you that pharma world, they're much more comfortable with less monitoring, really remote data capture than the medical device world. Everything, if it isn't written down or I didn't see the patient, it clearly didn't happen, and they question the data.

This device being a Class 1 device and post-market approved; this is the ideal. Plus, for this patient set, this procedure is the way they see them today, carpal tunnel patients they have their release done, and then they come back one time between seven and 10 days, and they never see them again unless there's a problem.

So bringing them back was absolutely going to be disruptive to an office anyway. So we rolled out Viedoc in partnership with Mural Health now. They're integrated today. But Viedoc was our vendor for EDC, and they have done a phenomenal job. We're sitting between 95% and 100% data retention for all time points that were out to one year.

**Tegus Client**
Awesome. So it sounds like it's a hybrid where they have to come in for one physical appointment and then the rest is decentralized?

**Vice President of Clinical Affairs at Sonex Health**
Correct. 88% of the data we collect in our RCT was done remotely from the patient to database not monitored.

**Tegus Client**
Got it. And do you think Mural Health would work for both the centralized and a decentralized model?

**Vice President of Clinical Affairs at Sonex Health**
They would. You know what I love about Mural Health? I've got a unique background with Mural Health and then Sam Whittaker. So when I was at AMS, American Medical Systems, back between 2009 and 2012, Greenphire was just starting up. Sam came into the office and cold called me on Greenphire.

At that point, we were running a premarket Phase III study to go to panel because we knew we're going to have to go to panel with it. And part of what we were struggling with is the patient payments. It was a fecal incontinence study, a ton of in-office visits, and the administrative burden we were putting on the sites was significant.

So through that, we agreed to be one of the early beta sites, AMS is. So I was one of its first probably 10 customers, maybe in five, and it worked beautifully. I love the ClinCard and I love the brand. It had the logo and it was a huge step forward in innovation in 2010.

I was like, what a great idea that now the sites would get a stack of prelabeled cards, had your study logo, which was almost in itself its own marketing. The sites would handle my card, but then you had the administration portal.

You go in and work through the portal, and you'd approve things. And yes, that visit came in, I'd agree to it, it wasn't as integrated, but it allows us to take on half of the duty for what the sites would have to do.

And then the sites, it was limited. Plus they didn't have to carry cash, and that's a huge liability. A lot of sites today, there's just no way. They won't manage that piece of it. And if you tell them they have to pay a patient out of their own funds that we just funded over, they won't pay the patient until the end of the study, which, for us as a sponsor, is a super high risk for patient retention.

Patients drop out especially if they're doing good. The ones that stay in the study are the ones that are doing bad. The ones that are doing good, they're like, I'm good. I don't need it. I don't need the money. I'm out.

So I had Greenphire, used Greenphire, loved them. I talked about them to everybody. I was a huge proponent of Greenphire. As I went through and moved on to other start-ups along the way, Greenphire's expense grew exponentially. And it was 3x more expensive than being an early beta.

I get that there's a lot of expense with it. But the marketplace still hadn't shifted their mind to being so much more electronic and having your payer vendor be so integrated into your study. So I never used them again in all honesty. So in this time around, Ledger Run, who we were using for our RCT, they called me and said, "Have you heard of Mural Health?"

They were struggling with Tango Card. They're like, Tango Card has no reporting capabilities. We can tell if the patient opened up the e-mail, but that's it. We don't ever know if they redeemed it. It just became a real nightmare because Ledger Run doesn't want to get in this business of clinical study payment. So we were talking about it, and he said, "Have you heard of Mural Health?" And I said, "I really haven't." So wouldn't you know within a week, they had told Mural Health about me.

Sam and I had disconnected. Sam sent me an e-mail, and he was like, “I don't know if you remember me. I worked with you at AMS." I'm like, I love Sam. He's just so innovative. So when he sat down, and we did the side-by-side comparison between the two systems, I like where Mural Health is going. I feel like it's more cutting edge of what we need in the industry. And myself, after 28 years of running clinical studies, I'm pushing the envelope of what we can do to make it as least burdensome on the office as well as intuitive and give the patient a voice, which I think Mural Health does.

**Tegus Client**
Got it. So of the products that you're using for Mural Health today, could you walk me through what each of those are?

**Vice President of Clinical Affairs at Sonex Health**
Yes. We don't use all of them. We use some of them. So they're integrated into our database. Every 24 hours, they come through our database to see what visits have happened in the last 24 hours, and they push the payments directly to the patients.

So the patients do use their Mural Health app. They log in, set themselves up at the beginning of the study, and within 24 hours of providing their data, they get their payment. We are also using them for site payments. Now our contracts are very different in the sense we don't like in-person visits.

So sites get an upfront when they start the study. They get a lump-sum payment for all of the research training that they have to do and our device training. And then they get onetime payment on procedure date. So after procedure has been done, they get a onetime payment to the site.

So it's not as laborsome on the site. We do not have patients coming back to the office, so we don't get to capitalize on the rideshare or the Uber app pieces. We don't do that because our patients don't have to go in. I can see where that would be of huge value, but we don't do that.

One of the things we're kicking the tires on right now is when you do a long-term study, it's not as important for one year. But for two, three, four, five year data, if you're going to go out to long term, you have to keep the patients engaged.

And we as a sponsor and every company I've been in have struggled about how do you reach out to make the patients understand that they're participating in the study and providing their data, potentially provides a product in a physician's pocket for somebody else farther down the road, give them the what and the why in it for them beyond just what their personal data is.

So in the past, I've provided as a sponsor template newsletters that we've asked the site to send out to the patients, get their feedback, and how things are going. But we're always adding more work to the site, which is a really crappy thing to do. It's hard as it is.

Research coordinators in most spaces today, this role was added to whatever they were doing in their normal job anyway. So they don't have a whole lot of time. What we always have to think about in the sponsor's perspective side is, how do we keep the minutes, it has to be minutes that, that research coordinator touches that patient to be able to move them forward in the study without disrupting their normal day practice.

Mural Health, the way they built their app, they have the opportunity for us to send out messages for the sites that can be labeled by the site and sent directly to the patient. So it's a way to keep the patients engaged, and know what's the status of the study.

We said it would be 120 patients enrolled. We're at 80 patients enrolled. This is the timing we think that the data will be published out there where you could see it. You're making a difference, human interest stories. That, to me, it helps us as sponsors, allows us to be able to connect with the patients without us connecting because we're not allowed to have their PHI.

**Tegus Client**
Got it. As a sponsor, what is your relationship typically with patient feedback or participant feedback historically without Mural Health? Meaning, do you have a good pulse on what's going on from your sites? Do you feel in the dark?

**Vice President of Clinical Affairs at Sonex Health**
It really depends on the therapy because in my time, I've done cardiology, immunology, hepatology, pulmonology, urology, and now I'm in orthopedics. So very different. If you bring the patients back, you get some feedback. Most of the time, the feedback that you get is squeaky wheel.

If you ask the sites to provide them information, you're going to get some of the research coordinators that are just super diligent. That's what they do. They like building that strong relationship with their patients. The relationship between the site and the patient is really what gets the patient to come back for their follow-up visits.

I think that as we move more to decentralized trials, we're going to struggle. It will be blind to us. All we'll know is either the data is coming in or the data is not coming in. So the way we have chosen at Sonex to derisk that is ensure the patient is paid within 24 hours when they submit the data.

The added bonus of being able to reach out and get some feedback from the patients, our sites when we talk to them about it, they're loving it. So the mission registry we're launching, that's huge. 2,000 patients is a lot of patients to be running through, and we're going to enroll them all by 18 months. So when we talk to the sites, the research coordinators are expressing their concern about, how do I keep up with this? What if I get information?

The other issue we run into with payer vendors a lot of the times, if a patient has a problem with their payment, they want to reach out to us. So they go through our website, which is a medical device manufacturer, and they're calling our customer service. And now they're giving us PHI. They're like, "Hey, I need help. My payment didn't come through."

What we as a sponsor can't do is we can't talk to the patient. So then we're going back to the site saying, "Hey, we can't talk to your patient. Can you talk to the patient about that?" That is a burr in the saddle. Mural Health, because of the way they've built their app and are building the relationship with the patients, the patients don't call our sites. They're calling Mural Health, which is the way they should do it.

**Tegus Client**
Got it. So you mentioned that Mural Health can pay within 24 hours. Is that unique in the industry? How does that compare to the payment timeline of something like a Greenphire?

**Vice President of Clinical Affairs at Sonex Health**
Yes. So Greenphire says they can do it. I will tell you that I have not been in that boat. So when I started using them in 2010 for our study at that point, it was two to seven days. It took for a while and it was really just loading the money on the card, and how quickly that transferred.

I understand from Greenphire's presentation when they came and bid, they could do that. The difference was the setup time and the reporting that I immediately got. I think I'm probably biased to Mural Health just because of the way they've built their platform. It looks and feels a little bit different. I like the versatility of how they pay the patients. Now to me, that stood out for Greenphire versus Mural Health.

So when I talked to Mural Health about it, I said everybody can do ACH bank transfers. They can do a check, they can do an e-card, e-Visa. The e-Visas are nightmare because people get a lot of the time to e-mail, gets caught in someone's junk folder and the patients are calling. It's just not great using the app right away.

When I was talking to Sam, he's like, "We could do Venmo, PayPal, we could do a debit, credit. What do you want to do?" I'm like, "What do you mean you can do Venmo, PayPal?" So if you think about patient payments in the disease space you're in, for ours, we have a wide range of ages. So technology, those that are even in the PayPal and Venmo are probably your 30 to maybe 50. But above 50 to 80, they're not doing Venmo or PayPal, they want a paper check. So when I sat down with Mural Health and talk to them, they gave me like eight different ways.

And it's interesting to see what I've been tracking, and it's part of what I'll talk about in the upcoming two different conferences about decentralizing your studies, and what's worked and what hasn't worked for us. But I've broken down by what type of payment type patients have selected and by their age group. So you need that versatility, but you really should be looking at a sponsor as what's your patient profile and then find a vendor that serves that.

**Tegus Client**
That makes sense. And why isn't Greenphire able to offer that flexibility of payments? My understanding is they only offer prepaid cards or direct deposit or check. Is that correct?

**Vice President of Clinical Affairs at Sonex Health**
Well, I don't know that. I said they presented to me in the bid process this year. They presented where they could do just those, but they can also do e-Visa, which is what we were doing with Ledger Run and Tango Card, and that was just a nightmare for us. The harder part is when you work with innovators, and I think Sam Whittaker is an innovator for me. So I love doing clinical studies. I love working for companies that go, "You're going to do what to who?"

I like the cutting edge, push the envelope, why do the normal? So when I talk with Greenphire, what I get today is not Sam Whittaker of 2010 passionate, listening to the customer. How do I get there? This is a behemoth payer system that was 3x more expensive than I was willing to pay for this study.

A guy that knows the system but doesn't have an ease way in changing and driving them to be on the cutting edge. They're comfortable in the space they're in. And some companies like even Boston, they're risk averse. So that may work really well for a Boston or a Medtronic. But for us in the start-up environment, we have a defined runway. And our money runs out at a certain point, or we go out and raise more money.

I need to move quickly. And that's where I think Sam Whittaker in particular, and Mural Health, they're listening and leaning into those that want to drive the industry, not those that are just watching the study, it's those that are driving their studies.

**Tegus Client**
Makes sense. And you talked about some of the challenges with an e-Visa card. Can you help me understand just the differences between a prepaid card and e-Visa? Is that the same thing?

**Vice President of Clinical Affairs at Sonex Health**
One is tangible, one is not. One is an actual thing you hold in your hand. So I still have the original ClinCard demo that they gave me. But usually, when patients come in, and they sign up for the informed consent, they sign up for the study, the sites on Greenphire will hand them a pamphlet that has a card taped in it.

It doesn't have the patient's name, but it is branded with the logo of the study. So with all color coded, it's marketing, and we used to say it's marketing in your wallet. So every time they wanted to use it, they can pull it out and use it as a debit card or a Visa card anywhere. And they hang on to it for the life of the study.

And then the sites would go in as well as the sponsors, and they would release payments, and it's just the money just showed up on the card. So it would send an e-mail to the site where it would set up with the patient's e-mail. The site would approve a payment, will send an e-mail to the patient to let them know, "Hey, we've just loaded $25 more or $100 more in your card, feel free to use it."

There also came with that card was servicing fees. So if they left a balance on it, there was like a $3 annual fee. And once the study was over, that mean the patient is now responsible for paying to keep the card open if they hadn't used all the money. So there were some other fees attached to it. It was great for marketing and it was innovative in its time.

Then it moved to this middle space where, if you've ever done an e-survey online and say, "Hey, we'll send you an e-Visa or send you an electronic Visa card." It's an e-mail, you go and click on it. It gives you a Visa card number that you can use for online shopping. You can't go in and use it on an ATM, but you could use it for online shopping purposes, or you can get a specific. So for us, we have Ledger Run. And when we pay the patient, the patient got then notified to go to this Tango Card site.

They got an e-mail from Tango Card with a link, they click on it, and the patient could pick at that point do they want a $50 e-Visa like that, and they'll give you a number, or you would get either a vendor card or target card or cold card and they were all electronic. The interesting part about how Tango Card does that is us as a sponsor, we fund the amount of visits that have happened.

So if it's happened, we put the money over there in their accounts, so the patients could draw on it. If the patient never figures out how to get their card from that or how to use it, Tango Card keeps that money. They never give it back to you. It's done. We couldn't get reporting to tell if a patient had pulled that money from the account, or if they had actually used it.

So we had a scenario where patients calling Ledger Run or us saying, "Hey, I never got my card, I can't find my e-mail," and you have to go through all of their e-mails or junk e-mails to find it, and it just became a nightmare. A lot of our aging population, those with carpal tunnel are seniors, a lot of them and they have no idea how to do online shopping. So it just ended up the technology and the application of it was like 20 clicks in. That isn't something somebody who's not internet savvy is willing to do.

**Tegus Client**
Makes sense. So Greenphire today, they're still offering those physical ClinCards as well as more of a digital e-Visa, which is the online shopping code, and then check. Is that the right way to think about it?

**Vice President of Clinical Affairs at Sonex Health**
I believe so, yes. I think there's the portal where they could do the physical card, and that's probably the easiest thing for patients, unless they lose their card. That's always an issue. But I think those are the three.

**Tegus Client**
Makes sense. You said it's always an issue if the patient loses the card. What happens in that case?

**Vice President of Clinical Affairs at Sonex Health**
So you run into a lot of fraud. So let's just even say, someone in the house steals the card, takes it and uses it. So now you've got a situation where the patient's payment, "Hey, we loaded your card. Your card is missing. Somebody used it." Now the site has to issue them a new card, and the sponsor has to approve to give them their money again.

**Tegus Client**
And how do you even know when that's valid or not?

**Vice President of Clinical Affairs at Sonex Health**
We end up just usually taking the word of the patients and just saying, "Okay, well, we'll have to issue them." But that often requires, either the card has to be mailed or FedEx-ed to them. We ask for tracking when you do that, if you don't physically hand the card to a patient. Then we ask you to FedEx it to someone you can track it that the person gets it. Or the patient has to come back in.

And then our type of scenario where patients never come back in after their one week follow-up, it just did not make sense for us to be so involved or lean so heavily on a touch base where the patient has to come in.

**Tegus Client**
Okay. And I know that you mentioned you are not using transportation options because of your particular trial but help me understand the existing landscape of transportation options with Greenphire, let's say, or other vendors in the market and how Mural Health's current solution compares to those.

**Vice President of Clinical Affairs at Sonex Health**
Yes. It has moved so far along the way that the studies that I ran between 2010 and today, a lot of the times, we would get invoiceables for the sites. I didn't use a vendor, I didn't use Greenphire or Mural Health or any of the vendors for that.

Those are qualified in your contract as invoiceables. If a patient is out of pocket, a lot of times, the sites would just pay for it. The nurse practitioner would have to set it up or the research coordinator will have to set up an account with Uber or at that point, it was mostly taxi services. Then within 30 days, we would pay them. It's a nightmare. Oftentimes, it becomes one of the gating factors for patients not coming in for their follow-up visit, they don't have transportation and it's a problem.

I hadn't even thought about it. To be really honest, I hadn't even thought about it as a problem that needed a solution through our payment vendors like this. So it wasn't until we did the RFP this time around for the study, that both Greenphire and Mural Health came forward and said, "Hey, we have this built in to what we do."

The app for Greenphire isn't as user-friendly and progressive as it is for Mural Health. So when I looked at the demos for both of them, I thought, if I'm a patient and I wanted to get an Uber to go where I need to go, I think the integrated nature of how Mural Health has built it in would be more successful and easier for a patient to use.

I think that's a phenomenal feature, especially for patients that live in the black and brown community, or they're in a study and they're paycheck to paycheck and can't afford to even cover it for 30 days. And it's a nightmare for big universities trying to cover the cost while sponsors figure that out.

**Tegus Client**
Just to clarify a little bit more around the transportation offerings of each. My understanding is both Mural Health and Greenphire offer a mobile app for participants. And that mobile app has an integration with, let's say, Uber, I don't know if Lyft as well, but ride-sharing. So if I'm a participant, I basically pull up my Mural Health app, I request a ride-share directly through that mobile app. Is that right?

**Vice President of Clinical Affairs at Sonex Health**
I haven't used it. So I would say that's the way it was demoed to me, and it looked pretty slick.

**Tegus Client**
Got it. And then as a patient, am I paying for it right then and there, and then I'm getting reimbursed? Or I'm basically requesting a ride, and that's being paid?

**Vice President of Clinical Affairs at Sonex Health**
The way I understand it is when we bid out our contract, part of what they asked about was, would there be invoiceables? And if so, what would they be?

**Tegus Client**
And what is an invoiceable?

**Vice President of Clinical Affairs at Sonex Health**
So typically, in a study, what you'll have is what the patient gets paid for their follow-up visit, their data, what we're paying for them to spend the time, to enter the data. Invoiceables are anything like, they came back on an unscheduled visit because they have an adverse event. So the site needs to get paid for this extra visit. It wouldn't be something that they would normally do if the patient hadn't been in the study.

An invoiceable might be as easy as an IRB renewal fee but it can also be for patients. Say, a patient needed to come back, and they needed a hotel room. Maybe they live 200 miles away and there's a hotel room and a ride to and from. Those are all invoiceables and we handle them in a separate part of our budgeting process, but it depends on the type of the study and how many follow-up visits. We'll have a slush fund sitting out there.

We put the onus on the sites to prove it happened. So the historical way we've done it we said, "You send us an invoice saying what it is, provide the receipts, and we will reimburse you." The way that Mural Health presented it to us when we were building out our budget, they said, "Hey, what do you think the chances are you would bring them back?" It's a minor zero, but what if I did? What if a patient did have to go in? They said, "We have prefunded a good portion of the first six months of the study."

So we put in amounts of money with Mural Health, but that sits in its own ownership account that Mural Health draws upon. I want to say they have access to it. So they're one of the access folks, but they manage that, but it's not in their bank account. It's like in a holding account, and it can draw down from there.

Now we can make the choice as a sponsor to either go in and say, "We have to approve every one of these before they happen." Or in good faith, at a $50 cab ride, we would allow them to draw down from our prefunded amount. And that's what I would do. It doesn't happen that often. It's really the exception and not the rule.

**Tegus Client**
Got it. So essentially, if I'm a patient, I open the mobile app, I hail a ride-share even from the site. I don't come out of pocket, the money that's financing that. It's basically requesting that Mural Health is providing the compensation to cover that through this prefunded account, that the two of you effectively have stewardship over. Is that the right way to think about it?

**Vice President of Clinical Affairs at Sonex Health**
Correct. That is an excellent way to write that. The beauty of that as well, they give us accounting tracking. The reporting we get from Mural Health is awesome.

**Tegus Client**
Tell me more about that. Do you still have visibility for that?

**Vice President of Clinical Affairs at Sonex Health**
No, and it's not been good. In the industry and then total, everybody that I've ever used, it's been really tricky. So oftentimes, when you're dealing with site payments and reconciling, you're very transactional for one at a time. Having somebody or having a banking partner like this that can give you the breakdown, not only in what you pay to each site. I provide my study budget by site to my vendor. So whether it be Greenphire or Ledger Run or Mural Health, I provide my study budget to them for site payments and patient payments.

Then they build it on their site. So I have a report that shows me how it broke down. So as they're paying them out, it just checks it off and said, "Okay, here's what you anticipated paying for this patient. This is what you've already paid." I can do it by the patient level or by the study level.

I get two reports. I get patient report, and I get a site report. So I can see if I've gone over or under or if I'm on pace, what I paid. That piece is huge for us. Plus, they also help us with Sunshine Reporting Act at the end of the year, which was just a nightmare.

**Tegus Client**
Do they help you with what?

**Vice President of Clinical Affairs at Sonex Health**
So that we know how much we paid into the research hospitals. The last reporting piece that we have to get often on our side is we need an accounting by site for research centers to do the Sunshine Reporting Act. And it gets gray when it's like, what's patient payments, what's reimbursement for services versus what actually was the institution and/or physician. So, they can break that down for us. It's great.

**Tegus Client**
And how would you do all of that otherwise?

**Vice President of Clinical Affairs at Sonex Health**
We have to do it in our own accounting, and it's pulling all of our own books. So on our side, we have to look at how much did we transfer over. And then we have to come up with our own internal reports to say, "Okay, we sent this lump sum over." Then we get our itemization. We create our own report, and then we send it to the physician to say, "Hey, does this look right?"

They validate it, or they say, "Hey, there's a discrepancy in it." They give a period of responding to that, and then it goes back to them, and then we report it from there. They're much more collaborative to hearing what our needs are.

I can just say, Ledger Run this year has really struggled on giving that to us for TUTOR just because this isn't their area of responsibility. Patient payment and site payments like this isn't what Ledger Run was built to do. They've been super helpful for us. I like them, and they're a small company, but time savings on the reporting for our accounting team is super helpful.

**Tegus Client**
And to that point, do you have a rough estimate of how much time is spent as more manual way versus Mural Health's approach?

**Vice President of Clinical Affairs at Sonex Health**
Well, I can tell you this year, when we did the Sunshine reporting, it can go from a week for the accounting team and my clinical team to sit down to reconcile it all, to maybe a two hour to pull the reports, and make sure everything looks good to us.

**Tegus Client**
And if you were using Greenphire, would the approach be similar to that, a reduced two hour process?

**Vice President of Clinical Affairs at Sonex Health**
I would think so. What I found even in the quote process with Greenphire, and this is just a personal pet peeve, when you're in the process of trying to get a quote, if it takes six weeks to get a quote, I can only guess what it's going to take to get my Sunshine Reporting Act because in my head, if I'm dating you at that point, this is as good as it's going to get. So if this is as good as it's going to get, then I don't feel like you're hungry for my business.

It's an add-on that I get. We're a small start-up. We're not your bread and butter. But there are people like me who are really loud voices when you do well. I was disappointed with Greenphire's urgency and when I've asked for things, they're like, "Well, we can add that as an enhancement idea. We'll put it on our list." I think, great. That's wonderful. That's not going to help me.

Sam would like lean in and say, "Tell me more about that. How does that save you? How does that help you? Let me talk to my team." I got a, "Let's talk about it. And if we find that there's significant savings, you're probably not the only person that could benefit from it."

**Tegus Client**
Yes. Going back to the transportation, does Mural Health also offer a white glove services transportation, meaning like almost like a KAYAK for coordinating my hotel or like a number I call where I'm like, "Hey, I got to get to and from the site. Can you coordinate it at all"? Is that something that's also in the market today?

**Vice President of Clinical Affairs at Sonex Health**
I don't know. I haven't needed it, I haven't asked. No one has come to me and said, "Hey, this is a killer idea for that one-off scenario."

**Tegus Client**
So before integrations with ride-sharing apps, transportation and hotels, how was all that facilitated for participants?

**Vice President of Clinical Affairs at Sonex Health**
So typically, a site would contact me, our contact or whoever is running the study and say, "Hey, we've got a patient that's coming up on their three month follow-up visit. They're over 200 miles away. Can I get approval from you to go ahead and book a hotel room and provide transportation to and from?" And we say, "Give us an estimate. Tell us what it is." And then we say, yes. Then this hospital itself would cover it, they would invoice us, and that in itself, it just becomes a nightmare.

Now what we can do, and I think even in early Greenphire, we could have done invoiceables in the sense that we could have loaded the money. If the patient could afford to cover the hotel, I think early on in 2010, I do think we had one or two scenarios where we actually pushed the payment on their Greenphire card, their debit card to cover a hotel, that a patient had to send the receipt to the research coordinator. The research coordinator had to upload it and send it to us, so we could approve it. And then we transferred over the money in two to seven days. But there's a lot more administrative hand-holding.

**Tegus Client**
Great. If you think about kicking off a clinical trial, how difficult or easy is the actual recruitment and retention of participants? Is that considered a top priority challenge of initiating the clinical trial?

**Vice President of Clinical Affairs at Sonex Health**
The landscape has changed so much in all of these industries, especially in the sponsor side of things. I'll tell you, each patient population in each disease state is different. Recruitment really depends. For us, there is a 1.7 million patients sitting on the sidelines that aren't getting carpal tunnel release, and we're trying to figure out why.

So what we believe, and what I've seen in the 1.5 years I've been here, is the patients don't want an incision in their palm. And they don't want to have to go to an OR to get it done. Can't we do it in an office?

So if we go direct to patients, we found that for us, for this particular procedure and this patient population, that if we do direct to patient, whether it be social media, radio ads and doing free scanning, open houses with ultrasound, and working with physicians to bring patients within the clinic, that, to us, led to rapid enrollment.

We enrolled our RCT in four months once we started doing patient recruitment activities. Unbelievable how fast it happened. So the patients are there. And then we were white knuckling through ePRO. We decided after procedure date, we never require you to come back for this study. I had my Board looking at me like I was crazy. I said, "Trust me, ePRO is going to work. These patients are going to give us their data."

And the big concern is you've now put the money into it. And if you have a study that has a 70% retention rate, you've lost 30% of your patients. The criticism at the time you go to publish that data is they're going to say, "Okay, you have 70%. What happened in the other 30%?" Knowing you need 95% to 100% of your data to really be able to push back on the naysayers.

You need all the available data to say, "This is everybody or as much as everybody as I can get." And numbers that are 90 or above are the ones that you don't see much of in clinical publications or haven't in the past.

The new systems we're leaning into is ePRO but it works in two. And to me, the magic piece to ePRO is all three. I would say, the patient has to believe in that they're making a difference. And so the patient population being able to do ePRO, they have to be able to not be a flip phone patient. Do you have a corded phone or a flip phone? You're probably not ideal for the study.

So to be technology savvy, there has to be rapid payment. They need to get paid, they can't wait until the end of the study to get their payment for it. And you have to have some communication to win hearts and mind, given the why. Why are they selling this? What is their data? How is their data contributing to a bigger initiative that changes the marketplace?

**Tegus Client**
Makes sense. In your current role, recruitment has not been particularly difficult. What about retention? Has that been difficult?

**Vice President of Clinical Affairs at Sonex Health**
No it hasn't been. And surprisingly, both studies that we have launched, both TUTOR and ROBUST, they're at 90% to 95% at all time points. I think all of the big ones, which is baseline, two weeks, one month, three months, six months to 12 months, we're at 100%.

**Tegus Client**
Is that why there is a shift towards more decentralized trials because it drives better retention?

**Vice President of Clinical Affairs at Sonex Health**
I think it's at risk of whether it really drives better retention. I think you have to look at the patient population. And I will tell you that the carpal tunnel patients that we've treated so far, the majority of them are Caucasian and middle-class families. So electronics and being able to get to technology is not an issue. I think if you get into disease states that are much more challenging and you're in a depressed economy or a Black or Brown community, that makes it very difficult.

The assumption that everybody has Wi-Fi is inaccurate. That's one of the things that I led at Boson, is like, "Hey, this space, if you really want true diversification in your patient population, we need to solve the technology problem, access to technology, access to getting to visit." So I love that Mural Health and Greenphire as well, are, "Let's give them transportation with not money out of their pockets." We have to meet them at where they sit economically.

I think patient retention coming in, ePRO, nobody's going to believe my numbers. I'll tell you that today, when I get up there and stand at the podium in October and November and start talking about what we're doing at Sonex, people are going to be blown away because these are numbers you don't see with ePRO. I think it's doable, are you leaning into the right solution partners?

**Tegus Client**
So in your experience, most recently aside, are retention and recruitment generally considered one of the biggest challenges of clinical trials?

**Vice President of Clinical Affairs at Sonex Health**
Yes, I would do for sure because time is money. Now I'll tell you, at Boston and some of the larger companies, they have the grace for studies to slowly enroll. I will tell you, for start-ups, that's not it. I mean you were a plane going down a runway. So recruitment is massive in the start-up, and way more important in the start-up than it is anywhere else.

And then retention really is about engagement. You need the clinical data to be able to either get approval or publish on it to get purchased or get CPT code. So we're driving time lines all the time in start-ups. So yes, I would say those are our two key issues right there.

**Tegus Client**
Makes sense. And then as you think about measuring the ROI of something like a Mural Health, you mentioned time savings for the accounting and reconciliation that they can help you with. What are the other areas that you have found time savings or speed to market or maybe other cost savings with patients, just any areas where you feel like there's been a clear tangible ROI?

**Vice President of Clinical Affairs at Sonex Health**
So it's an interesting conversation that we just started having. So this mission registry we're going through right now and this 2000-patient registry, the cost to do a Mural Health or a Greenphire is about the same between the two of them, to be honest. They're expensive and they're significantly expensive.

But I sat down with our Board and our CEO and said, let's talk about it. How much is it worth to keep that patient in the study? Let's talk about that. At what point would you be willing to pay? If you're paying $2.5 million for a study or a $5 million for a study, and you've lost 30% of your patients at two years, you now are running the risk of the data being criticized when you go to publish it. If you could have 80% retention, what would you pay for that? What would that be worth to you? If you get a 90% retention, what would you pay for that?"

That's where the conversations come in, is that data being bulletproof. How do you make the data more bulletproof? That is around having all of the patients. I'm amazed the numbers that our investors have said, "Yes, I'd pay that." So would you pay $100,000 to have 10% more of your patients in the database? They're like, "Yes, probably so."

The value of the incremental loss of each patient is significant. So we're talking more about, we want rapid enrollment, we want engaged data. We cut it several times in the clinical study. So for our RCT, we needed to start the study in July of 2022. We needed to complete enrollment by end of January 2023. We had to clean and publish all of our data and have it EPUB-ed by May of 2023 for a CPT code application in June of 2023. They gave me one year to run an RCT and get it published, and we did it. And that is because we used Viedoc, and we leaned into an ePRO system and then did patient payments within 24 hours.

**Tegus Client**
That makes sense. And then what role specifically did Mural Health play in that? Or how much would you attribute to Mural Health as opposed to ePRO?

**Vice President of Clinical Affairs at Sonex Health**
Yes. So here's the part with that. We started with one vendor and finished with another. So Mural Health came in and saved us. What was interesting to me, and I'll be real frank about it, is that when we decided to make the shift from Ledger Run to Mural Health and they took over, we were trying to figure out how many of the patients had not redeemed their Tango Card, even though they have been sent the link. So we wanted to make all patients whole regardless.

So as we're going through it, we worked with the sites. We sent that. Mural Health worked with the sites directly to get everybody moved over, all their patients signed over into the new portal. Out of 122 patients, we probably had 20 that came back and said, it's a varying degree, either "I didn't get my last payment from Tango Card," or, "I never got any payments," but yet, they still give us data. And I think that plays into it. It's early on in the study. So they're not dependent on it.

None of the amounts are a big deal. They're $50 per payment. So it isn't like it's earth-shattering, it's not your mortgage, but they still were giving data. Where you end up running the risk is when you go long term and you've got $100 payment or $200 payment on an annual basis. That's when they start dropping off. So yearly, you really see a big drop-off.

So for Mural Health, they went in and they came back to us and said, "Hey, we've talked to all your patients, and we've helped the sites get them all moved over. We have 20 patients, and here are the visits they said they've missed. What do you want to do about it?" And we said, "Pay them out of Mural Health, back pay them, and we're going to write off the money we send to Tango Card."

Now that means that we had to assume that these were lying to us, that the patients were. So we're like, all right. Tango Card kept our money anyways regardless, so we went ahead and paid it. That piece, I think making the patients feel heard and I think it was very important to us as we roll into ending the study this year.

**Tegus Client**
Makes sense. It sounds like Mural Health was really important to retention or can you help me understand that?

**Vice President of Clinical Affairs at Sonex Health**
I feel like Mural Health leaned in, and we're doing what the research coordinators weren't doing. We're keeping their fingers on the pulse. Once the patients have already been treated, the research coordinators are oftentimes, like I said, PAs, nurse assistants, office managers, they moved on to their regular job. It's a squeaky wheel. Unless the patient has a problem, they're not calling the patient again because we're getting all the data remotely.

So what happened was is you lose touch of these patients that aren't getting paid or have payment issues. Mural Health stepped in, and they were the ones that worked through the patient resolutions. Most of the time, when they were 20 patients, the site had no idea the patient haven't receive their money.

So I do appreciate that and we didn't have reporting to even see it. So the site was like, "Hey, you're asking me to make these phone calls when I've got a regular day job. Can't we run a report and see what they've been to pay and did they use it?" And with Tango Card, I couldn't. But with Mural Health, I could.

**Tegus Client**
Got it. On a scale of one to 10, how likely are you refer Mural Health to a friend or a colleague?

**Vice President of Clinical Affairs at Sonex Health**
That's going to be 10, would be at 12 at this moment. I'm telling you, I think they're awesome. Now I'm sure there are other awesome technologies out there. I haven't met them.

**Tegus Client**
And then as you think about the average cost per patient, I know it varies by trial, but how should we think about what it is today and how it changes with Mural Health?

**Vice President of Clinical Affairs at Sonex Health**
Average cost of a patient. So there's a lot that goes in when you think of acquiring the cost of a patient. Is it fully burdened or not burdened? I think Mural Health is like belts and suspenders. I don't own numbers, and I need some time to think about that one because I do think that's a good one.

When I think of when I partner with different technologies with patient recruitments, communicating with patients, all of them are belts and suspenders. So how do we make sure that we are shoring up and putting ourselves in the best bets to have a full dataset? But if you're looking for a value, shoot, that's a tough one. I don't know yet.

**Tegus Client**
I'm trying to put a number or quantify an improvement to retention or dollar savings or anything that you could tangibly point to, if you had to justify the spend for this moving forward to your Board.

**Vice President of Clinical Affairs at Sonex Health**
Yes. So typically, what you'll see in a typical study, you will see 10% patient loss attrition at one year. And then you will get 10% to 15% every year thereafter. That tells you how much you lose. So in a fairly well-run study, you'll be somewhere within 25%, 20% of your patients are gone in two years. So if you think about that, at one year, we are at 4% on one study. And on the second study at six months, we're at 0% attrition. To me, that's huge. When you can take the number from a 15, 20, 25 down to a single digit, that's huge. That's worth it.

**Tegus Client**
And what is the cost per lost patient to you?

**Vice President of Clinical Affairs at Sonex Health**
I haven't calculated that out. It depends. It's exponential, so the more expensive the more you lose. So a handful of them. If you're at 10%, that's easy to justify away. But if you get to 20% to 25%, then you've got a problem. You're looking at 80% to 75% of your data. That patient could be worth $100,000. That was that conversation I had with the Board. I'm like, at what number would you buy your way back up? If you could buy points up, what would you buy?

**Tegus Client**
Okay. Well, thank you again for taking the time to speak with us today. This was very helpful. Enjoy the rest of your day.
