### Fundraising Strategy & Timeline

- Call option with trusted advisors for feedback before formal Series A
- Two key proof points required before fundraise:
	- Next market (Minnesota) operational and running
	- Massachusetts achieving market-level profitability
- Anna can function standalone or layer on Blueprint for multiple opportunities
- Current investor conversations:
	- Transformation: positive, wants updates when ready to fundraise
	- Andreessen Horowitz (a16z): Daisy and Eva leaning in significantly more
		- Eva (Left Lane) has multi-site healthcare services investment experience
		- Pitched PT roll-up previously, showing deep domain knowledge
		- Could influence Daisy despite being junior
- Hold period strategy: not racing, open to preemption but no pressure

### Market Expansion Plans

- Massachusetts profitability timeline:
	- Currently generating ~$1M annualized center-level profit
	- Opening 2 new centers (J-curve expected)
	- Target: $2M aggregate cash flow by mid-2026, offsetting corporate expenses
- Minnesota acquisition opportunity:
	- Two founders with Medicaid contract looking for exit (~$250K)
	- Buys 9 months of market expansion runway vs uncertain timeline
	- Would need GM to run market initially while installing own team
- Arizona/Indiana Medicaid contracts secured but MCO contracting needed (6-9 months)

### Technology Architecture & Vision

- Centralized tech product suite as competitive moat:
	- Data ingestion layer: Airbyte, AWS Glue, Kinesis feeding data lakehouse
	- Critical semantic data ontology layer for structured/unstructured data
	- Foundation models: Bedrock, LangChain, Pinecone vector database
	- Continuous reinforcement through Sagemaker
- Key insight: advantage lies in machine learning/data mapping vs pure LLM play
- Current status: ~10% complete with mini-stack for Blueprint VB map parser
- Resource constraints: need significant capital and specialized talent for full build
- CTO hire would be first priority with Series A proceeds

### Clinical Leadership Assessment

- Potential transitions needed in clinical co-founder roles:
	- Elena (Chief Clinical Officer): may not scale to current business requirements
	- Possible knock-on effects with Ellie (training side)
	- Yael: strong NDBI expertise, want to retain
- New clinical leadership requirements:
	- Case consultation capability for complex cases
	- Clinical team inspiration/rallying ability - “who clinicians want to become”
	- Thought partnership with business and tech teams
- Timeline: 1-2 months for decisions, common at this stage (seed to Series A)

### Next Steps

- Minnesota acquisition decision needed within few weeks to 2 months
- Tech architecture validation through Aaron/Tuva community introductions
- Potential clinical leadership search if transitions proceed
- CMO introductions requested from portfolio companies for calibration
- Continue proving Massachusetts profitability and Minnesota market entry
