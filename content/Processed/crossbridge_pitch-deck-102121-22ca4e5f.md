### Problem
*   Chronic autoimmune care is uncoordinated, wasteful and often not evidence-based resulting in over **$18 billion wasted spend** and poor patient outcomes.
*   Payers increasingly expecting life sciences to **prove value** in contracting for market access and are unprepared.

### Solution
*   Autoimmune care with improved patient access, right-touch clinical team and coordination with specialists.
*   SaaS platform with shared predictive AI analytics to align provider, payer and pharma to **improve outcomes and lower total cost of care.** EMR integrated software to optimize evidence-based care and treatment effectiveness.

### Market Size
*   **$1 Billion + total addressable market** expands with additional disease area growth.
*   Rheumatology initially, then gastro and neurology.

### Go To Market
*   At risk payers and "payviders”. Life science companies, both manufacturers and diagnostic companies.

### Traction
*   **Geisinger as customer and development partner**—acquired Geisinger's proven rheumatology platform to improve physician productivity, workflow and outcomes.
*   Pipeline & market validation include early paying **life science and payer customers**, with a growing opportunity pipeline.

### Funding
*   **Raised $2.5 million seed funding since Feb 2020.**
*   **Seeking $8 to $10 million series A in Q1 2022.**
*   Use of funds to pursue customer opportunities, product development and go-to-market strategy.

care model for chronic
autoimmune patients in a
value-based setting.

We work with payers,

*   **1 in 6** Americans has some type of autoimmune disease (That's ~50M!)
*   **~$140 Billion** Spent each year. (about the same as cancer)
*   **2X** Demand for specialists than supply
*   **& 26%** of care is not evidence-based
