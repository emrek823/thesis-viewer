## Summary
The proposed rule updates the Increasing Organ Transplant Access (IOTA) Model for Performance Year 2, likely modifying reimbursement mechanisms for organ transplant procedures and networks. This suggests potential refinements to how Medicare reimburses and incentivizes organ transplant care delivery.

## Startup Angle
A precision matching platform that uses AI to optimize organ allocation, reducing wait times and improving transplant success rates by leveraging the new model's potential performance metrics. First check would come from a progressive transplant center or organ procurement organization (OPO) looking to demonstrate superior clinical and economic outcomes under the updated model. The startup could create a real-time matching algorithm that wasn't economically viable before the policy's performance-based incentive structure.
