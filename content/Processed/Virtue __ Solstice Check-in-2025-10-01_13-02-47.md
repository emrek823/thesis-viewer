	- Chandru from Columbia joining May 2025 (delayed due to scholarship/research)
- Focus on younger AI-native talent
	- More cost-effective and technically aligned with platform needs

### Technical Integration

- PromoMats integration successful
	- Full access to Phathom’s documents achieved
	- Setup completed in few days by team
	- Replicable process for future clients

### Fundraising Strategy
