### Enterprise Sales and Product Development Strategy

- Workflow-focused approach gaining momentum
	- Hiring engineers quarterly specifically for workflow development
	- Transitioning away from other responsibilities to focus solely on this area
- Market validation through rapid prototyping
	- Built basic version of what Tennr does in 3 hours
	- Immediate customer interest and adoption requests
- Target vendor replication strategy
	- Hubspot CRM functionality
	- Referral management systems
	- Comprehensive platform covering 70% of digital health company needs

### Technical Architecture and Differentiation

- Business logic maintenance as primary operational expense
	- Customer communication workflows (4 text maximum before cardiac rehab)
	- Automated state transitions replacing full-time manual processes
- Palantir comparison and competitive advantage
	- Forward Deployed Engineers (FDE) translate business logic into conditional statements
	- Tonic eliminates need for engineering maintenance when changing scripts
	- Focuses on smaller-scale data problems vs. Palantir’s enterprise pipeline complexity
- DFA (Deterministic Finite Automaton) implementation
	- Enables deterministic natural language processing
	- Leverages past run data for performance optimization
	- Handles narrow, repetitive workflows (5-20 daily executions)

### Customer Implementation Examples

- Health system deployment requirements
	- Complex healthcare workflows with deeper data pipelines
	- Regulatory compliance considerations
- VC fund use cases (Sean and Emre’s workflows)

### Next Steps and Strategic Considerations

- Knowledge graph development through multiple source integration
- Higher-level implementation approach before deeper technical investment
- Continued evaluation of market positioning vs. existing solutions
