### ****AI Boom vs. Bubble****

For all the fears of over-investment, AI is spreading across enterprises at a pace with no precedent in modern software history.

For nearly three years, AI enjoyed unwavering confidence and record capital flows. The surge crowned Nvidia the world’s most valuable company.[1](#4e03a784-4a54-4f8f-a3a1-cc36827fe026) Foundation models announced close to **$1 trillion** in AI infrastructure commitments. Venture funding surged back toward all-time highs, with nearly half of it concentrated in just a handful of frontier AI labs.

Then the euphoria peaked. An [MIT study](https://mlq.ai/media/quarterly_decks/v0.1_State_of_AI_in_Business_2025_Report.pdf)[2](#55ec2039-4e62-4d4d-abb2-629eb0d1be67) claiming that **95%** of generative AI initiatives fail rattled markets over the summer, exposing how quickly sentiment could shift beneath the weight of AI’s massive capex spend. The whispers of a bubble became a din.

The concerns aren’t unfounded given the magnitude of the numbers being thrown around. But the demand side tells a different story: Our latest market data shows broad adoption, real revenue, and productivity gains at scale, signaling a boom versus a bubble.

![Enterprise AI is the fastest-scaling software category in history](https://menlovc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/0-enterprise_ai_growth.webp)

Enterprise AI has surged from $1.7B to $37B since 2023, now capturing 6% of the global SaaS market and growing faster than any software category in history.

**For Menlo’s third annual State of Generative AI in the Enterprise report, we surveyed ~500 U.S. enterprise decision-makers and combined their insights with a bottoms-up model of the generative AI market spanning model APIs, infrastructure, and applications. Since 2023, our team has tracked AI’s evolution from early experiments to broad enterprise deployment, giving us a multi-year view of the speed and scale of this transformation.**

### **Follow the Money: Where Do Enterprise Dollars Flow?**

Our data indicates companies spent **$37 billion** on generative AI in 2025,[3](#b80db139-f442-4176-8179-56de9fa744e8) up from **$11.5 billion**[4](#bac4b9dd-2752-467b-9bf4-3f4f06cca02e) in 2024, a **3.2x** year-over-year increase. The largest share, **$19 billion**, went to the user-facing products and software that leverage underlying AI models, aka the application layer. This represents more than **6%** of the entire software market, all achieved within three years of [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/)’s launch.

Growth extends far beyond a handful of AI chat apps, touching every domain in the economy. By our count, there are now at least **10 products** generating over **$1 billion in ARR** and **50 products** generating over **$100 million in ARR**, led by the model APIs powering applications ([Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/)\*, [OpenAI](https://openai.com/), [Google](https://gemini.google.com/)), but increasingly distributed across departmental solutions in coding, sales, customer support, HR, and verticals from healthcare and legal to the creator economy.

![Generative AI spend by category: 2023-2025](https://menlovc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/1-genai_spend_by_category-120825-scaled.webp)

In 2025, more than half of enterprise AI spend went to AI applications, indicating that modern enterprises are prioritizing immediate productivity gains vs. long-term infrastructure bets.

### **How AI Enters the Enterprise: The Path to Production**

After three years, enterprise AI’s path to production has taken shape. Early adopters had no playbook. Now, distinct patterns have emerged that break from traditional SaaS. Enterprises prefer buying over building, showing stronger purchase intent, and adopting AI through product-led growth at a scale rarely seen in enterprise software.

### ****Enterprises Are Buying More Than Building****

For a while, the prevailing wisdom was that enterprises would build most AI solutions themselves. Bloombergtrained [BloombergGPT](https://www.bloomberg.com/company/press/bloomberggpt-50-billion-parameter-llm-tuned-finance/) for finance in 2022, Walmartbuilt [Wallaby](https://corporate.walmart.com/news/2024/10/09/walmart-reveals-plan-for-scaling-artificial-intelligence-generative-ai-augmented-reality-and-immersive-commerce-experiences) for retail in 2024. Teams were confident that, with the right data, domain expertise, and scaffolding, they could handle everything in-house.

In [2024](https://menlovc.com/2024-the-state-of-generative-ai-in-the-enterprise/), that confidence still showed in the data: **47%** of AI solutions were built internally, **53%** purchased.[5](#8d1f4365-11bc-415d-a0d6-8a5ba43b2f18) Today, **76%** of AI use cases are purchased rather than built internally. Despite continued strong investments in internal builds, ready-made AI solutions are reaching production more quickly and demonstrating immediate value while enterprise tech stacks continue to mature.

![Building vs. buying enterprise AI solutions: 2024 vs. 2025](https://menlovc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2-building_vs_buying-scaled.webp)

Last year, enterprises were split on building vs. buying. Today, enterprises have more ready-made AI solutions in production as their internal builds mature.

### **AI Buyers Convert at Higher Rates**

Enterprise buyers approach AI with notably high intent. We found that, once an organization commits to exploring an AI solution, deals convert at nearly twice the rate of traditional software: **47%** of AI deals go to production, compared to **25%** for traditional SaaS. That elevated conversion reflects strong buyer commitment and clear immediate value. Our survey data reveals that most organizations surface a long list of potential AI use cases—often **10** or more—but focus their adoption on near-term productivity gains or cost savings. While enterprises identify slightly more internal-facing use cases(**59%**) than customer-facing ones (**41%**), both categories move through the pipeline at nearly identical rates, suggesting that operational AI investments deliver value just as reliably as customer-facing innovations.

![Conversion rate of AI buyers vs. traditional software buyers](https://menlovc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/3-ai_buyers_vs_saas_buyers-scaled.webp)

AI buyers convert at 47% vs. SaaS’ conversion rate of 25%, indicating that AI delivers enough immediate value to short-circuit standard procurement processes.

### **PLG: Individual Users Now Drive AI Adoption at 4x the Rate of Software**

Outside of centralized procurement channels, AI solutions are increasingly finding their initial “land” in the enterprise through individual users rather than the enterprise executive. We found that **27%** of all AI application spend comes through product-led growth (PLG) motions, nearly **4x** the rate in traditional software (**7%**).

And that number is conservative. When we account for “shadow AI adoption”—employees using personal credit cards for tools like [ChatGPT Plus](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-G7TYuJJCE-gpt-plus), where roughly **27%** of usage is work-related[6](#f33a028a-0597-4b44-9ef5-2754bd2c24bc)—PLG-driven tools may represent close to **40%** of application AI spend.

![Product-led growth (PLG) as a percentage of AI spend](https://menlovc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/4-plg_ai_adoption-scaled.webp)

In AI, PLG motions reach and convert enterprise users far faster than traditional SaaS. Real usage proves value well before any formal contracting process begins.

In AI, PLG motions are reaching enterprise scale faster and going further than in traditional SaaS. [Cursor](https://cursor.com/)reached **$200 million** in revenue before hiring a single enterprise sales rep. [n8n](https://n8n.io/)built its business on open-source community adoption, formalizing contracts only after hundreds of employees were already active users. [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/), [Gamma](https://www.gamma.app/), and [Wispr Flow](https://wisprflow.ai/)\* scaled in the same way.

Developers and technical teams are especially receptive to this motion. Many discover tools for individual use, prove their value in day-to-day work, and create bottom-up demand that eventually converts to enterprise contracts. [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/),[OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/)\*, and [fal](https://fal.ai/) follow this pattern, turning informal adoption by product managers and engineers into enterprise agreements once the tools are embedded in development workflows.

### **Startups vs. Incumbents: New Entrants Gain Ground in AI Apps**

At the AI application layer, startups have pulled decisively ahead. This year, according to our data, they captured nearly $2 in revenue for every $1 earned by incumbents—**63%** of the market, up from **36%** [last year](https://menlovc.com/2024-the-state-of-generative-ai-in-the-enterprise/)[7](#01521709-fdd6-4710-b410-35ae63aff480) when enterprises still held the lead.

On paper, this shouldn’t be happening. Incumbents have entrenched distribution, data moats, deep enterprise relationships, scaled sales teams, and massive balance sheets. Yet, in practice, AI-native startups are out-executing much larger competitors across some of the fastest-growing app categories.

* **Product + engineering** (**71%** startup share): Code generation is the canonical example for why startups win. [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)was the first mover and had every structural advantage, yet Cursorcaptured significant share by shipping better features, faster—beating Copilot to repo-level context, multi-file editing, diff approvals, and natural language commands. Cursor’s model-agnostic approach let developers adopt frontier models like Claude Sonnet 3.5 the moment they launched, rather than being limited by Microsoft’s partner choices. That product velocity created a PLG flywheel: Cursor won the ground game with individual developers, who then brought it into the enterprise.
* **Sales** (**78%** startup share): AI-native startups like [Clay](https://www.clay.com/)and [Actively](https://www.actively.ai/)win by attacking workflows Salesforcedoesn’t own: research, personalization, and enrichment, which rely heavily on unstructured signals (web, social, email) that sit outside the CRM. By owning these off-CRM surfaces and expanding downstream, they become the AI layer reps actually interface with—disintermediating the legacy system of record in the near term and positioning themselves to potentially become the system of record in the long term.
* **Finance + operations** (**91%** startup share): In highly regulated domains like finance, incumbents like Intuit QuickBooksface high demands for accuracy that slow their ability to ship AI-native workflows. Although the total dollars here are still small, this paralysis creates a vacuum for startups like [Rillet](https://www.rillet.com/), [Campfire](https://campfire.ai/), and [Numeric](https://www.numeric.io/)\* downmarket to build AI-first ERPs with real-time automation and intelligent workflows—winning because the incumbent cannot move fast enough to deliver a credible next-gen product.

The chart below shows how this dynamic varies across enterprise departments, each with its own function-specific tooling. Teams grappling with fragmented, data-heavy workflows that lend themselves to automation lead AI adoption. Incumbents remain stronger where reliability, integration depth, and existing system dependencies outweigh the benefits of rapid iteration.

![Departmental AI: startup vs. incumbent market share](https://menlovc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/5-departmental_ai-startups_vs_incumbents-scaled.webp)

AI startups thrive in agile departments like market research, sales, marketing, and product. Incumbents hold their ground in IT and data science, where reliability and deep integrations outweigh speed.

The story changes as we move down the stack. At the infrastructure layer, the picture is more mixed. According to our data, incumbents hold **56%** of the market as many AI app builders continue building on the data platforms they’ve trusted for years. Although new AI-native infrastructure companies like [Temporal](https://temporal.io/), [Supabase](https://supabase.com/), [Neon](https://neon.com/)\*, and [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/)\*are seeing impressive growth, incumbents like Databricks, Snowflake, MongoDB, andDatadog have enjoyed just as meaningful re-acceleration—as even new AI-native app builders are still primarily choosing existing platforms to manage their data, orchestrate workflows, and monitor operations.

![Startups are winning across application AI but trail incumbents in AI infrastructure](https://menlovc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/6-startups_winning_application_ai-scaled.webp)

Startups dominate AI applications, earning nearly $2 for every $1 incumbents earn, while enterprise infrastructure spend continues to favor incumbents.

### **AI Applications: A $19 Billion Market**

The application layer captured **$19 billion** in 2025, more than half of all generative AI spending. This spend segments into three categories:

* **Departmental AI** (**$7.3 billion**), built for specific job roles like software development or sales;
* **Vertical AI** (**$3.5 billion**), targeting specific in
