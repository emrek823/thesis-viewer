### Company Background and Strategy

- Rob Davenport, Founder at Squid IQ - platform for medical device utilization management
- Origin story: Discovered problem while working with NY Hospital Association on supply chain localization (2018)
	- Chief supply chain officer: “We know what devices we purchased, have no idea what we own”
	- Nurses can’t find equipment when needed, causing waste and frustration
- Key insight from Kaiser’s Bernie Tyson: Healthcare systems should focus on clinicians, buy everything else “by the drink”
- Shifted from asset management to utilization management approach
- Partnership with American Hospital Association for national marketplace development
	- Piloted during pandemic for ventilator sharing between IDNs

### Product and Market Approach

- HTUM platform (play on HTM - Hospital Technology Management)
- Two core components:
- Problem scale: 2-3x overcapacity but inaccessible to frontline staff
	- 9-15 cents spent per capital dollar annually on device management
- User groups: Finance, biomedical engineering, nursing, IT
	- COO typically the decision maker (not CFO) - has control over operational inputs
- Go-to-market: Start with infusion pumps (“everybody has way more than they need, nobody has enough”)

### Fundraising and Next Steps

- Raising $3M Series A
- Currently in 2nd-3rd meetings with handful of investors
- First customer already renewed
- Landing larger IDNs: RWJ Barnabas next (14 medical centers, largest NJ system)
- Rob to send product architecture documentation for technical review
- Virtue process: 2nd call within days if mutual interest, then 1-2 weeks for decision
