Clayton then reviewed specific payor updates, noted specific delays and introduced new payor strategies including both state-specific and avoidable units-based approaches intended to simplify and accelerate contracting. He then shifted to EMS agency updates including new contracting in Texas and Georgia and discussed how RightSite is leveraging patient volume in its payor negotiations.

Michael reviewed RightSite's government relations strategy and the potential impact to RightSite from the BBB.

The Board engaged in discussions and provided feedback to management to help with Payors and expectations for the remainder of 2025.

The Board then shifted to Executive Committee and management was dismissed.
