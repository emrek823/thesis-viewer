**WASHINGTON, D.C.** — Today, **Congresswoman Diana DeGette (CO-01) and Congressman Larry Bucshon, M.D. (IN-08)** released next steps for Cures 2.1 and the 21st Century Cures initiative. This follows a request for information in June which yielded over 300 responses and recommendations to further innovation and access to quality health care.

“Building on the success of previous *Cures*legislation is vital to further the innovation that is necessary in health care. The information we received is helping to lay the groundwork for further bipartisan achievement in health care discovery, development, and delivery, and as we head into the 119th Congress, there is a clear path for us to power innovation,” **said Rep. DeGette.** “I am grateful to Dr. Bucshon who has been a tremendous partner in this process, and I look forward to continuing our work to ensure that patients, caregivers, health care providers, and the biomedical research community receive the support they need.” 

“Today represents another milestone in advancing a more dynamic, patient-centered health care system that incentivizes the development and discovery of new treatments,” **said Dr. Bucshon.** “Previous iterations of *Cures*legislation brought transformative changes to how we develop and deliver life-changing treatments to patients who so badly need them. The responses we have received over the past few months will undoubtedly continue to help shape a health care landscape that is innovative, responsive, and patient-focused. I am proud to have partnered with Rep. DeGette on this critical initiative as we continue to revolutionize America’s biomedical research for generations to come.” 

In June, DeGette and Bucshon put out a request for information which received over 300 comments on next steps for the 21st Century Cures Initiative. Major themes included improving clinical trials, improving the use of health information technology (IT), expanding the use of real-world data (RWD) and real-world evidence (RWE), improving Medicare coverage policies, ensuring proper Medicare payment for novel technologies, and addressing artificial intelligence in the health care space. 

A potential “Cures 2.1” update would aim to: 

* Create an environment that enables the rapid and appropriate deployment of innovative technologies to improve health outcomes;
* Build a health care infrastructure that enables information sharing, continuous evidence gathering, and implementation of new knowledge; and
* Foster innovations that improve public health, promote patient-centric care, reduce the burden of chronic disease, and conserve valuable resources.
