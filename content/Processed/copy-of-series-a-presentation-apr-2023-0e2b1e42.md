## Slide 1

Optimizing hospital revenue through AI

---

## Slide 2

1. We have created an AI-first workflow that helps hospitals improve revenue through more accurate documentation

2. Our first three customers have $18M in net new revenue (annualized) and we have $5.5M in new CARR (6X YoY growth) on $3M of burn

3. The same approach directly unlocks additional product areas

Traditional ML approaches have limited precision

Patient admitted

CABG

5L NCday 1

“post-op resp failure”
Surgeon note

4L NC, CXR
day 4

Patient d/c’ed

NLP limited due to one:many relationships and physician inattention

Post-operative respiratory failure (J95.82) results in a penalty

## Slide 14

Traditional ML approaches have limited precision

Patient admitted

CABG

5L NCday 1

4L NC, CXR

Patient d/c’ed

Supervised learning: limited due to confounding features and historically inaccurate labels

Acute respiratory failure with hypoxia (J96.01) results in a denial

These models then directly apply to new areas

Like CDI, denials software focuses on prioritization worklists; the user finds the evidence

SmarterDx can directly surface rejected diagnoses that can be appealed
