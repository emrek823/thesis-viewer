### Company Background & Team

- Christian (Co-founder): 3rd year medical student at University of Toronto, dropped out 2 months ago to build full-time
	- Funded $30-40K from line of credit until YC acceptance
	- Research background: Zero Tracker (living systematic review for government of Canada/WHO during pandemic)
	- Started as grunt, grew to co-lead research team
	- Self-taught coding after ChatGPT release
- Zion (President): Former Google Other Bets team (digital electricity incubation), Lux Capital offer (visa issues prevented), Index Ventures
	- Strong VC/startup ecosystem knowledge
	- Brought aboard for fundraising and recruiting capabilities

### Current Product Performance & Technical Advantages

- Why Otto Labs outperforms competitors:
	- Data quality issues in existing solutions
		- Human researchers only 60-80% accurate due to fatigue on repetitive tasks
		- Competitors train on incorrect data, naturally capped at 70% accuracy
		- Elicit (raised $20M Series A) claims 99.7% accuracy but benchmarks show only 70%
	- Novel pipeline techniques and verification layers
		- Accumulated ~1,000 datasets by leveraging user signups for data access
		- Benchmarking across OpenAI, Anthropic models vs fine-tuned open source
- Research validation: Preprint released June 2024 showing significant performance lead vs human researchers and commercial tools
- User traction: 1,500+ signups first week, top 10 pharma inbound, pilots with Government of Canada

### Business Model & Growth Strategy

- Phase 1: Capture systematic review researcher mindshare
	- Private alpha with 6 clients (2 recurring), $40K pipeline cleared
	- Public alpha releasing to ~100 researchers next 3-4 months
	- Target: 50K-100K users in 12 months through word-of-mouth from influential researchers
- Phase 2: Own systematic review supply chain
	- License access to constantly updated reviews (vs static PDFs from current publishers)
	- Leverage automation tool ownership to maintain competitive advantage
- Phase 3: AI-native publishing platform
	- Support for negative results, experimental data, work-in-progress
	- Neutral data layer for both human and AI agent consumption
	- GitHub/Hugging Face model for research ecosystem

### Fundraising Status & Milestones

- Current raise: $1.5M lead secured, seeking additional $300-600K
	- 18 months runway at $1.6-1.8M annual burn
	- Hiring plan: 1 engineer every 3 months
- R&D spend: $30K over 2-3 months for benchmarking and performance optimization
- Self-serve platform launch target: 6 months (conservative: 12 months)
- Revenue projection post-platform: Significant jump expected due to global adoption potential and career advancement incentives

### Next Steps

- Emre to discuss with Sean (partner) regarding ownership threshold concerns
- Emre to provide feedback tomorrow morning
- Potential angel investor introductions if Virtue decides to pass
- Memo sharing permissions confirmed for targeted outreach
