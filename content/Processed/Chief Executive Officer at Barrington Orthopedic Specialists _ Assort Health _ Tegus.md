## Client Interaction
Hi. Thanks for taking the time to talk with me. I am interested in learning more about the impact or potential for AI companies to have in the healthcare realm. We're having much more of a focus these days on the potential to automate a lot of the phone calls related to patient support, scheduling, things like that.

I wanted to get your take on the space and hear about what you're doing these days. I see you're CEO. Maybe, just to start, could you tell us a little bit about Barrington Orthopedic Specialists, how many...

**When did you evaluate these new AI reception options? Was it a couple months ago? Can you walk us through that process in which ones you looked at?**

### Expert
Sure. We have 17 physicians and we also have 11 mid-level providers that we have to schedule for. We have four offices. We also have physical therapy and occupational therapists in all four offices, of which there's about 40 headcount as far as PT and OT providers, as well as MRI in two of our locations. Pretty good-sized group, needless to say, that's there and we have to handle the scheduling of all visits and that kind of stuff for all four offices.

### Client
**What technologies do you use to help with receiving phone calls and all of the scheduling process?**

### Expert
Until we actually went live with Assort, it was all being done internally with a call center with live people. Just using normal call center phone as you might imagine.

### Client
**What do you use for your phone system? What technology was that?**

### Expert
It's an antiquated at this point in time. It was a Mitel software system, and they are in the process of sunsetting their support on the Mitel software. We're actually in the process right now of looking at and contracting with another vendor to provide the phone software.

We've brought Assort on. They are agnostic, is the easiest way to put it, regarding which phone system software we're using. We've been at Mitel for, I can't tell you how many years, a long time, probably 15+ years. We are looking actually in the implementation stages right now of RingCentral as the phone system.

### Expert
Yeah. We actually were forced. Maybe I'll give you a little bit of the use case scenario behind it, which is when we really started looking at this. Our call center, which functioned reasonably well, not great, but reasonably well. At one point in time, we had seven FTEs that were in the call center.

In late summer, early fall, we started to have some attrition, and hiring people was difficult and people that we hired that would come in would all of a sudden go, "This isn't what I was hoping for." They would leave. We were down to three and a half FTEs, so we were probably half-staff within the call center itself.

With that, as you could imagine, our wait times on hold were very long, in the 15-20-minute range. Our abandonment rate was close to 40% or a little bit higher at times. We were forced into looking at what the alternatives were. That's really what brought us to Assort. I will tell you, we did not evaluate anybody else other than Assort.

There was really a recommendation through a different vendor that we were working with on some other technology and integration and with that referral as well as talking with them and then really having a very good understanding of healthcare and physician practices, we felt like there might be others out there that were somewhat close to it, but we like to be early adopters in the practice and work with folks, and they were really wanting to ramp up their system and their capabilities, etc.

We really, within a matter of about three to four weeks, not even probably two weeks, from the time that we first heard about them and saw the demo to the time we signed an agreement, it was probably three to four weeks and then about a four-week implementation stage at that point in time. It's pretty quick.

# Client-Expert Interaction Transcript

## Client
Who was it that put you in touch with Assort or pointed them out?

## Expert
It was a company called Nexus-MD. They're a company that we were working with in order to gain images that were done at the hospital through the ER or whatever, so that we would have access to those and patients would not be forced to go get their CDs with all their images on it to bring it in, so they could avoid having to have X-rays done again.

We were already working with them with athena, which is our EMR and practice management system, to integrate in there, so we would check off the box that says imaging was done for an ankle injury or whatever. If we knew that it was done at one of the local hospitals, they would go out and query the hospital, be able to obtain those images and bring it back and stick them in our PAC system. That was the use case for that. They knew of Assort, they had worked with, I think the founder for Nexus as well as the co-founders at Assort, all knew each other, and that's how we got introduced to them.

## Client
Makes sense. When exactly did you go live with Assort? Which month was that?

## Expert
We went live very end of November. Really, call it December.

## Client
You have had some experience with it now. How happy is your company with Assort? If you had to rate your satisfaction on a scale from 1-10, 10 being the best, what would you give it as a rating right now?

## Expert
Today, I would probably give it at least a nine, if not a 10. They've done a phenomenal job taking the idiosyncrasies of our practice and being able to really teach the system to do things correctly. There's always issues that pop up that you can't account for, but for the most part, they've done a fabulous job dealing with all those parameters and specifics that each of the physicians want to see, patients they want to see, what types of injuries, etc., what kind of body parts they want to deal with. It really handles that extremely well.

## Client
How do you measure the success? Do you continually test it and make sure its AI is high quality? Do you have any metrics on the abandon rate, or anything to speak to on that?

## Expert
Sure. We continue to measure our abandonment rate across the board. I haven't seen June's yet. May's abandonment rate was 6% or 7%, and April's was 4%. Down from a high of 40%+, so we know that it's working and we're getting the patients because they're not just hanging up with all that. It's helped a lot. Length of calls have dropped, and wait times have dropped.

Length of calls were probably close to seven to eight minutes before. They're down to two, two and a half minutes, and that includes our own individual live agents that are handling all of that as we've cleaned up the questions that we ask our patients on both sides. They're the same as if they were being asked by the AI attendant as well as a live agent. It all works itself together. It's been really great.

Call wait times have drastically dropped, the abandonment rate has drastically dropped, and our call satisfaction, one of the things that we asked Assort to do probably about a month into it since we were getting ad-hoc kinds of things and we wanted to do a survey after the fact.

Patients that got all the way through the process they were asked just a one-question survey like, "How was your experience?" On a four-point scale, they were averaging, when it first started, probably 3.4-3.5, and now up to about a 3.9. It's never going to be perfect. It's never going to be a 4.0. We continue to monitor.

**Client**
How much roughly do you pay? You can give a very ballpark answer if you're comfortable.

**Expert**
Sure. When we started, we were between $60,000 and $90,000. We're a little bit north of that now. We're in the six-figure mark, but we've also expanded services with them to exceed that six-figure mark.

**Client**
Do you see it expanding much more from here?

**Expert**
I think there are definitely opportunities to expand. From the time we started, which was really just looking at the call center itself, and being that extra agent while the phones are open between 8:00 A.M. and 5:30 P.M. We've now expanded. When our call center is down, i.e., all of our staff has left for the day, Assort is still on the phone, so to speak, so patients can actually schedule at 8:00 P.M., at 2:00 A.M. for next day.

That's cut down the amount of phone calls that we get at 8:00 A.M. when the phones open up because patients are able to get in earlier and, if they've had an acute injury, they're able to get scheduled with the doctor first thing in the morning if there's an availability, or definitely sooner than they would have, had they had to wait until the phones actually open.

That's the second use case that we've done. They're really running 24/7, 365 days a year as an agent on a call center. The other piece that we're not quite ready for prime time yet, but pretty close to it, is when patients will call in and they have a question for one of the doctors, clinical team members.

If the clinical team member isn't available, they'll be able to leave a voicemail that'll actually get transcribed by Assort and then actually uploaded into our electronic medical record for somebody to follow up. Some of our clinical team members will message from home as an example, versus being in the office. If they're at home, instead of having to dial in to a voicemail and check the voicemail and listen to the voicemail and everything else, it's already transcribed and waiting there.

They're able to react to that patient phone call significantly quicker. There's less of a discrepancy over interpretation of what the patient was looking for because they've got the true transcribed message from the patient that's there. Those are the two newer things that we've got. We're testing it with one of our physicians right now, so it's about ready to go live. Once we go live with the one, we'll test it for probably another week and then start to roll it out for each of the other physician providers we have.

Beyond that, I think there's definitely some capabilities for confirmation phone calls which we do via text right now, but could be confirmation phone calls and leaving voicemails. I think we can start to use them in our pre-authorization, pre-certification methodology there on outbound calls. I think there's a lot of opportunity. I just couldn't tell you what they're going to be right now. We keep coming up with new things that we could use them for.

**Client**
What technology do you use right now for the confirmation texts?

**Expert**
It's actually through athenahealth PM system. Right now, having been a patient of recent, I get the text that says, "Your appointment with Dr. John Doe tomorrow at 1:00 P.M. in our office. Please hit one to confirm or two to reschedule." Those go out now, but what was very interesting and what we found through Assort, is that even though we send those confirmations out, and they will go out via email, they'll go out via text, we still have a significant number of patients that call up, want to confirm with a person that they actually have an appointment tomorrow.

We get probably 40-50 phone calls every single day to confirm an appointment for tomorrow, which makes no sense because they've already confirmed that via text and/or via email. Patients just feel more comfortable making sure that they truly have an appointment that's scheduled.

It's been very interesting. Never would have thought that, but it's been consistent not just with our own practice, but we've seen and heard the same things from other practices at the number of people that are just calling to confirm. That's a phone call that if you're waiting for 20 minutes just to confirm your appointment for tomorrow, what a waste of time of everybody's time, whether it be a live agent or the patient that's calling. Makes it very easy.

## Client
Just confirm, sounded like you were understaffed before, but since using Assort, has it allowed you to change the dynamic of the team for contact center or reduce it?

## Expert
Yeah, when we started with this, like I said, if we were fully staffed we would have been at seven FTEs, and we were down to three and a half. As we brought Assort in, we were able to hire up. We actually got back up to seven along with Assort, and then we've since lost a couple of those folks again. Not a position I would ever want to do by the way.

I have a lot of empathy for the folks that are in that role, that are taking phone calls all day long from patients and everything else. We're down to really four FTEs, and our break-even when we did this originally from an ROI perspective was about one and a half FTEs. We're already exceeding that process with better outcomes for our patients and lower wait time for abandonment rates, so on and so forth.

## Client
Great. Are there any areas that Assort can improve on? I know you rated them nine out of 10 earlier. Is there anything they can do to improve?

## Expert                                     Sean Doolan
DO NOT COPY
Anything they can                          sd@virtuevc.com
do to improve? They've been extremely responsive to our needs and making adjustments when we can. I guess the answer is, nobody's perfect from that perspective. They've been extremely timely with making adjustments and I really can't think of anything that I would sit here and say for sure, "Boy, I wish they would do this better."

Again, they've been extremely responsive to us. Now part of it's because I think we're a reasonably good-size player for them. They've been able to test a lot of their software on a pretty good-sized group. They probably handle about 3,000 phone calls a month for us right now, which is probably about half the volume that comes in for scheduling. The other half is all either going to different individuals or patients that don't want to talk to a "robot" and opting out. They've done a great job. I really can't think of anything I'd say, "Boy, I wish they would have done something differently."

## Client
That's pretty exceptional. Are you working with the founding team at Assort?

## Expert
Yeah, we've been working with Jon and Jeff as well as Maura O'Sullivan, who's been the boots on the ground, our main contact through all this. As they've hired up to bring on new software engineers, they've brought those folks in so that we don't miss a beat. If Jeff or Maura isn't available, their software engineers already know what's going on. I think they've done an awesome job from that perspective.

That was my biggest concern, that they were going to grow too quick and not have the bandwidth to really handle new clients and still provide the same level of service that we were used to. I don't think it's just because it's us. I think they've really hired some great folks that really understand it, that do understand the healthcare and what needs to be done, and can step in for each other and really help out.

## Client
That's excellent. Just to quantify that, what would you rate their founding team from 1-10?

## Expert
That's a good question. I always hate to give somebody a 10 because nobody's perfect. I would probably give them a nine. Jon, one of the co-founders, when he started and when we started, I would say was a tad bit maybe aggressive, from the standpoint of wanting to close the deal and not giving us probably enough time to really mull it over as to what's the best fit for us.

Even though we got there, it was a bit of that pestering, "Hey, have you made a decision? Hey, have you made a decision?" Again, that's not necessarily a bad thing. I mean, if you're the one trying to sell it, you better be all in on it. That would be the only maybe criticism, if I want to call it that, that I would have of the process.

I just think it was a little bit aggressive with it, but not overly so, not enough to say, "I'm not going to deal with you," kind of thing. I think that's toned down a lot as they've continued to grow client base and everything else. I think he's recognized that. I had that conversation with him personally early on, and I think he took that the way it was really meant to be. It was more of a, "Hey, I just want to make sure you don't burn a bridge or two in here."

## Client
I'm curious if you think about all the use cases you could use Assort for over the next few years, what is the maximum you could see spend getting to?

## Expert
Boy. It depends on what else we end up wanting to add to it.

## Client
Sean Doolan
Let's say you add all the possible use cases you've considered.
DO NOT COPY
sd@virtuevc.com

## Expert
I'd say, probably double what we're paying right now. I could see that happening.

## Client
What is the piece of software you're paying most for in your organization?

## Expert
Overall?

## Client
Yeah.

## Expert
Just AI-related, it would be our practice management EMR system with athena.

## Client
Could you ever see an Assort getting close to the same amount of spend as the practice management software?

## Expert
No, I don't. I don't see that. I could see them partnering with somebody like an athena or whatever, because again, from my perspective, you like to stay in your lane. If you're really good at something, get really good at it and continue to improve upon it.

**Client:**
Yeah. Just to jump in, how much are you paying for Assort?

**Expert:**
We're paying low six figures right now, a year.

**Client:**
What about athena?

**Expert:**
Less than $1.1 million.

**Client:**
In terms of the technology you use to reach out to patients and say they have a bill and collect that payment, is that all athena handling that?

**Expert:**
It is right now, yes, it is all athena. That is something that we could potentially use Assort for on outbound calls. More of a predictive dialer kind of an idea behind it all. I could see us using something like that.

**Client:**
Got you. If someone came along with a new athena competitor and it was half the price and much better technology, would you consider it, or do you never want to consider switching that platform?

**Expert:**
Personally, the only way I want to switch a platform like that is if I'm ready to retire. It's the quickest way to lose a job. With that being said, I also know that it's a competitive market out there. It's all a matter of, would I consider somebody that was half the price, that could do the same job as what athena does for us right now? Would I consider it? The answer is absolutely, we would have to consider it. It only makes sense from a business perspective.

The use case behind it all and the EMR with all the records that are there, is really where I think it gets to be difficult. Just trying to translate everything from one system to another and have it go in the right place. All things being created equal, and that was something that could be done, the answer is absolutely, we would absolutely consider something like that.

**Client:**
Thank you for taking the time to speak with me. Have a nice day.
