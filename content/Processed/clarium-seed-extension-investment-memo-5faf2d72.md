## Investment Overview

We are seeking approval to invest $6M in Clarium's Seed Extension out of HAF2. We are leading the round at a $40M pre-money valuation and are leaving room for up to an additional $4M of capital from insiders and strategics (specifically health systems). At a high level, Clarium is building the core OS for healthcare supply chain management. We have spent significant time with Clarium's founder, Steve Liou, and have been impressed by the elegant platform he's built. We've also spent time validating the thesis with our Health Assurance partners and other experts in the ecosystem, which has increased our conviction in Clarium's product.

Post-Covid, hospital executives placed increased pressure on creating resilient supply chains. They are now cognizant of how essential their supply chains are to the day-to-day functioning of their systems and realize that they need to be more strategic about their processes. As systems today contend with rising costs, executives also see the supply chain as low-hanging fruit from a cost optimization perspective.

Although non-labor spend accounts for ~40% of a system's costs, there does not yet exist an end-to-end enterprise platform for supply chain management. This has resulted in a complex and cumbersome supply review/query process that requires investment in supply-chain specific personnel (often referred to as the value analysis team) and significant physician attention. Today, supply chain teams (which be as large at 100 individuals for very large health systems like CommonSpirit, a Clarium pilot customer) work across 7+ systems (supplier, warehouse management, EHR, ERP, POU, GPO, and EDI), leading to inefficiencies. Specifically, given the fragmented nature of information and manual coordination processes, supply chain specialists struggle to prioritize cases, identify and manage disruptions, and, most importantly to executives, manage costs.

An optimized system requires: 1) deep technical expertise and integrations across several systems; 2) a flexible and customizable UI; and 3) the ability to take action on action. Given the specialized nature of the workflows and integrations required to create this system, we don't believe a more generalized HCIT platform is well positioned to build supply-chain specific tooling, nor do we think those types of platforms will want to compete with sub-verticalized offerings. We have seen big platforms emerge in sub-verticals, such as RCM. Thus, we believe there is an opportunity to build a multi-billion dollar business in the space.

Clarium's goal is to become the core OS for supply chain management on both the provider and supplier side. They started building for providers first as it allowed them to be supplier agnostic. However, Clarium believes the data they aggregate from health systems will give them a lot of leverage as they start selling to suppliers.

Since founding the company in 2020, Steve and his team have spent ~2.5 years building Clarium's infrastructure and workflows. They worked with three early development partners — Yale NewHaven Health, Geisinger, and Boston Children's Hospital — all of whom have converted to paying customers. With the core platform and first three applications built, Clarium entered into pilots with Ochsner, CommonSpirit, University of Wisconsin, and Carle Health. Steve expects these contracts to convert by EOY or early Q1. On the back of this commercial traction and factoring in Clarium's robust FY24 pipeline, we believe now is the right time to partner.

It is important to note that one of the core drivers of our excitement is Clarium's ability to move beyond data observation and into data remediation. The first product Clarium launched, Disruption Monitor, is a data observation/workflow tool that detects early warning signs and helps teams resolve supply disruptions. However, all of Clarium's subsequent products (substitute manager, card optimizer, clinical intelligence, etc.) are designed to help teams directly optimize costs. Products on the roadmap (demand planner and vendor monitor) are also cost optimization tools that Clarium's existing partners have explicitly asked for.

## Broader Context & Problem

In the wake of Covid-19, when many health systems grappled with supply chain shortages, health system executives now recognize the supply chain as essential to the day-to-day functioning of their systems. Across industries, one of the biggest challenges during the pandemic was that companies didn't know what was going on with their supply chain because of poor technology. Many companies have since learned that being able to see what is happening along their supply chains is critical to avoiding and adapting to disruptions.

In health systems, because the supply chain oversees most of a health system's external spend, there is increased attention in making investments that optimize supply chain performance. The supply chain interfaces with and impacts every department. Despite the interconnectedness of supply needs, goals and objectives are frequently misaligned across departments, resulting in siloed and inefficient supply chain management. Currently, US hospital supply chain overspend costs ~$25B annually.

Analytics is the backbone of supply chain excellence, yet it remains a critical gap for many health systems. Specifically, systems struggle to aggregate data across all their systems to create an enterprise-wide view of the supply chain. Provider and supplier data is spread across multiple systems, and most teams still coordinate through spreadsheets and phone calls, resulting in disaggregated information and inefficient workflows. Given how narrow the margin of error is in supply chain operations, late or uninformed decisions can have significant adverse impacts both on costs and patient outcomes.

Several of the incumbents - Vizient, GHX, Tecsys, Cardinal, etc. - offer analytics products. However, they are expensive, use-case specific, and heavily reliant on consulting services to generate outcomes. There's a general consensus that analytics tools are only useful if they provide relevant insights to users and are embedded into daily operations to enable decisions. Thus, existing products on the market are severely lacking.

Our market research and calls with experts/HA partners has led us to believe that there is a need for a healthcare specific data visibility and remediation platform like Clarium. By starting off with low-hanging fruit like substitution and preference card management, we believe that Clarium can embed deeply into core supply chain operations and eventually become the de-facto operating system in the space. Over time, as Clarium garners a data advantage and scale, we believe there is an opportunity for Clarium to start selling to suppliers, and, eventually, disintermediate the GPOs. The purchasing of medical supplies is a much larger, $600B market opportunity.

## Product Overview

Clarium is a data integration, analytics, and workflow/remediation platform. Clarium seamlessly ingests, unifies, and normalizes data across all supply chain, finance, and clinical systems. It connects provider data with recurring feeds from suppliers, EDI platforms, and the FDA to provide end-to-end visibility. It identifies network signals on supply disruptions, usage spikes, approved substitutions, and item availability. And, it deploys workflow automation with task assignments, @ mentions, and alerts to improve collaboration. Net-net, Clarium is a N of 1 product on the market that allows supply chain/value analysis teams to make enterprise-wide supply chain decisions.

When Steve began working on Clarium, he leveraged his personal network to identify three design partners — Yale NewHaven Health, Geisinger, and Boston Children's Hospital. In the first few years of building, Steve was focused on creating integrations into all the major systems hospitals work with, so he could create an extensible market that would sell easily once he went to market. Today, Clarium offers end-to-end visibility on supply and demand at the system, hospital, physician, and procedure level. Clarium currently has three live products — disruption monitory, substitution monitor, and card optimizer - with a fourth - clinical intelligence - ready to deploy in Q1.

Clarium's flagship product is **disruption monitor**, which enables a system to proactively manage inventory and supply disruptions with its real-time network of data signals from suppliers, EDI, and FDA. Today, there is a lack of visibility into inventory, usage, availability, and potential disruptions. This is exacerbated by the fact that disparate systems and Excel reports/manual processes are used to manage inventory. Disruption monitor identifies and predicts disruptions in a unified platform that turns network signals into predictive analytics. Clarium's built in workflow tools — such as the ability to prioritize top disruptions using Clarium's "criticality" score and automated assignments/notifications — dramatically improve efficiency and collaboration.

The **substitution monitor** app was the next logical product in helping supply chain/value analysis teams make decisions based on the data Clarium surfaces. Today, it is a manual and time-consuming process to research and identify clinically equivalent substitutes. It is difficult to obtain approvals and track history/reversion to the primary item. The substitution monitor identifies substitutes using Clarium's crowdsourced database for medical devices and supplies approved by other providers. It also unlocks greater visibility by managing substitutes in the same platform as supply disruptions.

Most of Clarium's partners purchase disruption monitor and substitution monitor as a bundle. Clarium recently ran a study with Yale, which the system will soon publish, showing that their apps led to a 35% reduction in disruption resolution time and a 45% reduction in substitute approval time. This translates into $1.5M of annual labor savings (“soft” ROI).

Clarium started moving into "hard" ROI categories with the launch of **card optimizer**, which automates preference card management with AI-powered recommendations to standardize supply usage and minimize waste. Preference cards are documented supply lists for each procedure that assist OR staff in setting up instruments and supplies. They also provide data to track costs and patient charges. However, preference cards are manually updated every 18-24 months by nurses, which causes them to become outdated and unreliable, leading to data errors and significant waste. Clarium's app allows teams to review AI-enabled recommendations on updates to all preference cards, including team conversions, deletions, and additions, as well as adjustments to open and hold quantities. Clarium enables teams to communicate directly with clinicians to receive feedback on proposed card changes via mobile or desktop apps.

As a point of reference, Intermountain implemented a similar solution (which they subsequently sold to Olive, where it was shut down) that generated $90M+ of cost savings over three years. ROI is easy to generate for this product given straightforward attribution, so we believe this product provides Clarium with a unique opportunity to move into a shared savings model.

Clarium is also actively building three other products, which their system partners have asked for:
*   **Oculus AI:** LLM interface to allow users to ask questions and derive insights on normalized data across all systems (ERP, EHR, RCM, POU)
*   **Vendor Monitor:** Tool for tracking supplier performance (i.e., backorder rates, compliance rates, exception rates, etc). in real time to enable better business reviews with vendors and more informed negotiations/RFP processes
*   **Demand Planner:** Tool for surgical planning

## Total Addressable Market

According to Definitive Healthcare's HospitalView database, there are ~7.3k hospitals in the U.S., ranging from <25 beds to >250 beds. Based on Clarium's existing pricing, ACV per system ranges between $150K-$1.125M depending on the number of apps deployed. This represents a ~$4B SAM, or up to a ~$1B SOM for the top 500 health systems Clarium is targeting today.

It is important to note that we only looked at Clarium's existing SaaS business. However, based on the hard ROI we believe Clarium can deliver, there is a clear opportunity for the company to go at-risk and start taking a percentage of savings, thereby increasing revenue per system.

Long term, Clarium plans to create a marketplace for purchasing supplies. There is an open-ended question of whether they replace the GPOs entirely or partner with them to negotiate even better rates for their systems. However, Clarium believes the level of purchasing data they have from systems and their supplier-agnostic positioning is a much stronger value proposition than what GPOs offer today. If Clarium is able to build a next-generation GPO, they would have the opportunity to take a slice of the ~$600B healthcare supply market.

## Customer, Expert, Health Assurance Partner, and Investor Commentary

### Customer Call

On the customer front, we spoke with Christine L'Heureux, Director of Supply Chain Administration at BCH. Christine has been working in the healthcare supply chain sector for 24 years and has worked at several systems, mostly in the northeast. She has been at BCH for three years.

Before implementing Clarium, BCH faced significant challenges in managing their supply chain efficiently. The existing ERP system, while capable of retrieving necessary data, was cumbersome to use. The typical workflow involved manually pulling data sets from multiple systems, aggregating them in Excel, and attempting to construct macros that demanded regular, active updates. Her team did not have any dashboard, leaving members to sift through dense data pages, sorting and filtering information to extract insights. Christine noted that this workflow mirrored those of other systems she worked in.

This challenge was exacerbated during the pandemic when BCH established an offsite distribution center (ODC) to gain better control over their inventory. Despite the initiative, they grappled with a lack of systems to effectively understand and respond to real-time inventory demand. Their reliance on a distributor's software was also fraught with issues. They attempted to co-develop a more fitting solution for over six months, but the distributor never produced the software.

There seemed to be no technology on the market comparable to what Clarium offers. To Christine, the existing solutions were not geared towards genuinely addressing supply chain complexities.

BCH's engagement with Clarium began in the summer of 2021, when Christine connected with Steve. Christine was impressed with the mockups Steve showed her (this was in the early development days) as well as the acumen and agility of Steve's team. She communicated the challenges her team faced, emphasizing their need for proactive data management. Steve's team then spent weeks ingesting BCH's data, building a tool tailored to their specific requirements.

The first tool BCH used was exception monitor, and they later adopted disruption monitor. The latter has proven invaluable; enabling the BCH team to conduct real-time vendor reviews, flag critical inventory shortages, and manage purchase orders—all seamlessly on one dashboard. This transformative technology has streamlined BCH's operations—like automating order placements, a task which previously consumed two hours daily for a buyer—in a way that Christine thinks is indispensable. One of Christine's value analysis team members told her “he would cry" if she ever took Clarium away from him. Christine proactively evangelizes Clarium to her colleagues at other systems given the impact it has had on her own operations. She said she would partner with Clarium again "in a heartbeat", and she's ensured that leadership is aware of Clarium's necessity, so they continue to pay for it.

With regards to ROI, Christine thought about it on a product-by-product basis. With exception monitor, the most immediate ROI was on labor costs. BCH also managed to recapture funds that were previously left on the table due to the lack of real-time visibility. Disruption monitor also had a labor cost ROI. Beyond that, it curtailed BCHs frequent reliance on expedited deliveries. Prior to Clarium, BCH frequently overnighted supplies—sometimes even resorting to same-day deliveries for critical items. Now they find they rarely need to order JIT. If Christine were to add up the reduction in shipping costs, she believes the savings would be significant. Ultimately, ensuring that the right supplies are available when patients need them remains the overarching objective, and Clarium helps them accomplish that.

Looking ahead, Christine is particularly enthusiastic about the upcoming demand planner tool. The rollout has been slower than she's like because BCH is set to move fully to EPIC next year, but she's confident they will purchase the product. She believes demand planner will help them streamline pref cards to attain a utilization-based inventory system.

### Expert Calls

**Frank Longo - Vice President - Supply Chain Operations, Vizient**
Background: Frank has dedicated 26 years to Vizient, focusing the last 20 on supply chain operations.
Currently, Vizient's supply chain activities hinge on numerous systems, demanding the integration of diverse data sources, a task that proves to be a significant challenge. Actions such as new product value analysis and supply requests predominantly occur within an ERP system, which heavily relies on data either entered or fed from the EHR. This system has a glaring flaw: the necessity for the business and clinical sides to constantly interact. These two segments aren't inherently designed to mesh well, resulting in a plethora of inefficiencies. Consequently, many supply chain decisions resort to face-to-face meetings, occurring in real-time and, alarmingly, often devoid of crucial details. Although Vizient has attempted to address these challenges by introducing analytics tools, these platforms merely scratch the surface, offering only basic predictive capabilities.

**Rick Tayloe - Former Spend Management Executive, Vizient**
Background: Rick is a pharmacist by training. He worked in pharmacy supply chain for ~15 years at Novation before moving to Vizient, where he interacts with hospitals for their value analysis needs.
Today, this space is cluttered with a myriad of sub-scale analytics tools, predominantly sourced from GPOs. This fragmented approach has prevented the emergence of any comprehensive, leading solution. Despite supply chain departments being responsible for a staggering ~40% of hospital expenditure, healthcare purchasing remains trapped in outdated modalities. The aftermath of the COVID pandemic further underscored an essential need: predictive supply chain management. Yet, availability has overshadowed cost as the primary purchasing concern, signaling a shift in priorities toward supply chain operations. Disturbingly, many supply chain management solutions today remain rudimentary, akin to spreadsheets or even index cards. Big players in the space, like Vizient and Premier, often deliver analytics that are isolated from other vital data sources, further fragmenting the data landscape. While GHX showcases a glimmer of progress with their modular approach, and there are initiatives like Mayo Clinic's Clinical Supply Integration Network aiming for pricing transparency, the overall scenario remains bleak.

**Steve Lefar - Chief Strategy Officer, Strata**
Background: Steve has worked at Strata for ~5 years, most recently as CSO.
Strata, despite being the go-to financial system for many health systems, has limited engagement in the supply chain, primarily focusing on data extraction. The current state of supply chain management is dispersed, managed by a mix of clinical and business teams across various non-interoperable systems. This fragmentation means that there's no consolidated source of truth in supply chain management. While some analytics tools have emerged, they are limited to their specific segments and don't facilitate efficient decision-making. The manual nature of current processes, coupled with the high costs of some supply chain modules (reaching up to $1-2M annually), underscores the need for innovation in the sector.

### Health Assurance Partner Calls

We spoke with several of our system partners, including Intermountain, Ohio Health, and UCI. All our conversations were consistent, but the most salient points were made by UCI. They reiterated that they have also been focused on supply chain resilience over the past few years. A recurrent theme was the challenge presented by the fragmentation in the current systems. The healthcare sector appears to lack a holistic platform for end-to-end supply chain management, emphasizing a need for a modular solution that could integrate seamlessly into a broader ecosystem platform. Such a system would be invaluable, facilitating direct interfaces between health systems and supplier data.

While other senior executives might reference existing solutions, UCI suggested that there is a considerable gap. The current landscape, with constrained data analytics teams, emphasizes the necessity for a consolidated platform. Ideally, this platform would not only centralize clinical intelligence but would also provide a unified solution for all supply chain matters. With the vast amount of data available, a unified platform could usher in transformative insights, offering nuanced perspectives on various organizational operations. The supply chain, given its structured data and limited patient touchpoints, stands out as an apt domain for the deployment of this type of solution.

UCI noted that introducing a solution like Clarium, would likely prompt an RFP process given the ACV. They suggested that Clarium focus on quantifying and clearly articulating the ROI. They were in favor of a shared risk model.

### Investor Calls

We also spoke with the major institutional investors, AlleyCorp and 1984, as well as an angel investor, Labor Capital. Across the conversations, investors signaled a genuine respect for Steve's strategic approach and his ability to navigate the complex HCIT landscape. The investors found Steve to be intentional from the outset, notably in his selection of design partners. Although it took a longer time to build the product, they think this will pay off from a commercial traction standpoint. All the investors think that now is a good time to start building out the commercial team.

What resonated most across the conversations was Steve's temperament. Everyone we spoke to perceived Steve as calm and collected, which is an asset in HCIT given the arduous sales processes. They thought he had done a good job building an expert team and were impressed by his clear understanding of the GTM challenges. There's a shared belief that the company's recent traction is a direct result of genuine product-market fit. 1984 noted that Clarium is a standout in their portfolio with regards to healthcare enterprise sales.

We felt aligned with existing investors on the need to think through how to expand ACV and diversify revenue channels. We were also in agreement that it would be good to expand beyond founder-led sales and bring in a sales lead with more industry experience.

## Commercial Traction and GTM

Since founding the company in 2020, Steve and his team have spent ~2.5 years building Clarium's infrastructure and workflows. They worked with three early development partners — Yale NewHaven Health, Geisinger, and Boston Children's Hospital — all of whom have converted to paying customers. With the core platform and first three applications built, Clarium entered into pilots with Ochsner, CommonSpirit, University of Wisconsin, and Carle Health, and is expecting to enter into a pilot with University of Wisconsin Health in November 2023. Steve expects these contracts to convert by EOY or early Q1. Furthermore, Steve has generated a broader pipeline ~$4.5MM of unweighted revenue potential. The company's total pipeline represents ~$8.1M in annual recurring revenue potential, or ~$4.1M on a weighted basis.

## Metrics & Financials

Clarium is expecting to end FY2023 with ~$1.4MM ARR and is forecasting to hit ~$4M ARR by FY2024, which we believe is feasible with just existing, late-stage pipeline / pilot discussions. As a reminder, the below model assumes ACVs of $80k - $390k, depending on size, which we believe is conservative.

Our GC base case maintains management's assumptions on ACV and average products per customer ramp (as we believe these assumptions are feasible) and applies a discount to the FY2024 and onward total customer ramp, as shown below:

The business is likely to face 2 key challenges as they grow, and the management team is focused on proactively managing these concerns:

1.  **Slow adoption timelines:** Though the company does not anticipate delays with respect to implementation of their platform (which to date has taken ~4-8 weeks per customer), sales cycles to the hospital system end market are notoriously slow in nature, and it can take up to ~6 months to fully convert a prospect to a customer.
2.  **S&M Maintenance:** Given the often arduous nature of the health system GTM, the company may face challenges containing its S&M spend as it makes hires and attempts to accelerate customer conversion. The GC case assumes higher S&M spend as a % of revenue to account for this possibility.

We believe there is a substantial amount of upside for both price (Clarium is already charging current customers more per product than assumed in this build) and products per customer. We anticipate ACVs over time, as the company develops and sells more products, to reach $1.5-2M per customer for the full suite of products. Our assumptions on price per product and products per customer inform our GC upside case:

## Valuation & Returns

### Entry Valuation Benchmarking

Based on our healthcare valuation benchmarking work, we target pricing early-stage HC SaaS companies at ~18x NTM revenue to achieve a ~8-10x returns threshold, based on average growth profiles observed across our portfolio and steady-state margin profiles & valuation multiples at exit. Note that applying a ~18x NTM revenue multiple to our FY2024 GC Base Case ARR forecast of $3.8M would imply ~$68M TEV, which is higher than our post-money valuation of $50M.

### Pro-Forma Cap Table

Pro-forma for the seed extension, General Catalyst would own 12.0% of FDSO. Note that this assumes GC invests $6M of a $10M total raise at a $40M pre-money valuation, and that the ESOP is topped-up to 8% of FDSO on a pre-money basis.

## Public Comps

At exit, Clarium's business would mirror that of HC-focused verticalized SaaS companies that typically exhibit ~80% gross margins and >20% EBITDA margins. Given their strong FCF conversion, these businesses tend to command premium valuation multiples, which we believe should apply to Clarium as well. The most direct healthcare vertical SaaS financial comps are Veeva, Definitive, and Doximity; collectively, these comps trade at a range of ~3.9x-10.1x NTM Revenue. We believe Clarium benchmarks well to Veeva given it has been the most successful vertical healthcare growth story to date and is particularly sticky within its end-market (limiting churn risk) given its modularity. Similarly, workflow tools built on top of interoperability layers tend to be sticky solutions across verticals. For the purposes of returns, we assumed Clarium would exit at ~12.0x NTM Revenue.

A $40MM pre-money represents ~28.6x FY2023 ARR and 10.6x FY2024 ARR. This is a premium to the top-end healthcare vertical SaaS comps today, which trades 12.0x FY2023 revenue (majority recurring), and 10.1x FY2024 revenue (majority recurring). We think, given the Clarium's growth velocity and margin profile, the premium to HC SaaS (superior growth, in-line margin) is deserved.

Furthermore, long-dated software valuation comps imply that a ~12.0x NTM Revenue multiple is quite appropriate. Over the past 5 years, direct HC SaaS comps trade at ~12.0x NTM Revenue, whereas Other SaaS Comps trade at ~8x NTM Revenue. Overall, valuation comps have subsided from 2020-2021 highs back to long-dated averages.

## Returns

For our returns analysis, we assume an EOY 2028 exit based on NTM revenue figures. Our GC Base Case for 2029 is conservatively $61.4M in revenue. At a $40M pre-money valuation with ~30% future dilution and a 12.0x TEV / NTM Revenue multiple, our base case implies a 12.9x MoM / 67% IRR for GC Capital invested at the seed extension. To put their FY2029 revenue assumption into perspective, even conservatively assuming a base case of a ~$1.7Bn SAM, the company would need to capture <5% of available dollars to achieve our FY2029 projection.

We will note that we believe there are significant upside levers to this model as the company continues to expand per-customer ACV over time. This is represented by our upside case. At a $40M pre-money valuation with ~30% future dilution and a 12.0x TEV / NTM Revenue multiple, our upside case implies a 38.9x MoM / 108% IRR for GC Capital invested at the seed extension.

## Competitive Landscape

The healthcare supply chain landscape is characterized by the proliferation of many stakeholders, fragmented systems which create data silos, and a general lack of interoperability; this makes it difficult for provider organizations to optimize their supply chain properly. Furthermore, supply chain operations today involve interaction with many systems and several internal and external stakeholders, which requires supply chain professionals to accommodate the lowest common denominator medium for communicating information, which in many cases is still paper documentation, phone, and email. Data remains stuck in analog formats, and digitized data is often locked up in legacy systems. As a result, supply chain decisions are often made without complete situational context, and workflows remain cumbersome.

Legacy companies and stakeholders involved in supply chain management, including EHRS, POU systems, GPOs, WMS systems, EDI systems, and ERPs, have been under pressure to provide better interoperability, enhanced analytics, and an overall better end-user experience. Several incumbents Vizient, GHX, Tecsys, Cardinal, etc. - offer analytics products. However, they are expensive, use-case specific, and heavily reliant on consulting services to generate outcomes. There's a consensus that analytics tools are only useful if they provide relevant insights to users and are embedded into daily operations to enable decisions. Thus, existing products on the market are severely lacking.

For example, since 2020, Vizient, via its acquisition of Intalere and Safe & Reliable Healthcare, its divestiture of its Contract Labor Management division, and its investments in Panda Health and Phrase Health, has doubled down on its software and analytics strategy. However, the adoption of their analytics solutions has been limited due to their limited functionality and inability to produce or enable cross-functional insights or workflows. On the EDI side, GHX has seen a similar outcome after they acquired Lumere.

Legacy vendors have further led to the need for robust middleware infrastructure where a comprehensive application layer can reliably be built on. This largely mirrors the evolution of the fintech ecosystem, where middleware infrastructure providers like Plaid made it much easier to build modern application-layer software on top of legacy banking systems. We believe the healthcare supply chain is at a similar inflection point in the push toward digitization, which has paved the way for a newer wave of supply chain enhancement software companies.

Today, although a plethora of supply chain enhancement software solutions exist across the entire value chain, none has done a great job of embedding themselves as a source-of-truth middleware layer. For example, supplier intelligence platforms today rely heavily on the ERP for data, which is often incomplete and lacks the flexibility in architecture to help scale the development of a comprehensive application set. As a result, the healthcare supply chain today still broadly lacks a comprehensive interoperability and visibility layer that not only functions as a source of truth for supply chain professionals but also helps automate key workflows that occur between supply chain professionals, business decision-makers, and clinical decision makers via the development of applications.

We believe Clarium has:
1.  Intentionally developed a robust set of integrations such that they can act as a robust middleware infrastructure
2.  Built high criticality, ROI-generative applications that streamline their GTM

By starting with low-hanging fruit like substitution and preference card management, we believe that Clarium can embed deeply into core supply chain operations and eventually become the de-facto operating system in the space.

In addition to the software companies outlined above, a plethora of marketplace/GPO companies provide consulting services to healthcare organizations (e.g. ECRI, and Cardinal Health). We view these services as largely replaceable with proper interoperability and technology leverage. Furthermore, several procurement, AP management, and payment platforms exist, such as Hybrent, triValence, Helia Care, and Gather & Procurement Partners. These companies, due to their lack of broad interoperability and because they are primarily downstream in the value chain, don't present a compelling wedge. Finally, the DME landscape is rapidly evolving as equipment sharing becomes more efficient and hospital-at-home services become more ubiquitous. Companies like Cohealo, Tomorrow Health, Verse Medical, and GC portfolio companies Better Health and Maribel Health are servicing this shift.

## Double Down Criteria

We would consider doubling down in Clarium if the company:
*   Consistently delivers fast and seamless implementation cycles while maintaining 80%+ gross margins
*   Demonstrates a repeatable pathway towards seven-figure ACVs through a scalable 'land and expand' motion with their modular-oriented customer base
*   Proves the value proposition to health systems through significant traction for relevant modules and continuous, attributable ROI
*   Maintains strong new product development velocity and rapid customer feedback implementation cycles

## Key Risks

*   **Scalability of GTM:** Clarium needs to create a replicable and efficient end-to-end GTM motion and implementation process that can help reduce customer conversion timelines. The health system GTM is typically a notoriously lengthy process, posing a risk to the company's ability to achieve customer conversion goals.
*   **Platform vs. Best of Breed:** In most cases, there is a debate on whether to purchase a single platform with broad functionality or choose best-of-breed solutions for each use-case. Though we believe that Clarium has the engineering and product talent to create best-of-breed solutions across all of their modular offerings, if other companies in the supply chain stack (e.g., GPOs) that are more embedded today make point solution offerings that overlap with Clarium's offerings, this may be a threat to the company's ability to expand into new customers or capture expansion revenue.
*   **Ability to Unlock ACV Expansion:** Though we don't assume or capture ACV expansion in our base case model – either through higher pricing or higher average modules per customer – Clarium needs to prove that they can continue to land and expand at higher-than-assumed prices, as they have with their initial customers. Furthermore, though we don't assume any revenue from at-risk dollars, we believe there is a significant opportunity for Clarium to capture a percentage of savings attributable to their platform.
*   **Ability to Generate Continuous ROI:** As mentioned, capturing at-risk dollars is a great way to accelerate GTM and unlock ACV expansion. However, there is a risk that most savings are captured in the early years of implementation, which could hurt the company's ability to maintain its revenue capture over the lifetime of its contracts. Today, the company charges a SaaS fee and thus does not face this problem.
*   **First-Time Founder:** While we have been impressed with Steve, his humility, and his thought process around this problem space, he is a first-time founder, and he may struggle to effectively operate and grow the business once it reaches more scale. Although Steve has never led a large team and the majority of his prior experience has been on small teams within banks and buy-side funds, we have been encouraged by his talent acquisition capabilities to date, his ability to sell the Clarium vision, and his thoughtfulness around prioritizing team additions to date. We believe the biggest risk will be his ability and willingness to delegate BD responsibilities as the company scales, as this is unproven today.

## Health Assurance Considerations

A core tenet of our Health Assurance thesis is to build the infrastructure layer for transforming health systems. We have hatched and invested in several companies that address parts of this stack but have a gap in an end-to-end supply chain management vendor who can attract the majority of the market with end-to-end and modular offerings:
*   Commure - Healthcare OS, RCM & RPM
*   Aidoc - Clinical Decision Support
*   Tendo - Patient Engagement
*   Memora - Care Journey Management
*   Adonis - Revenue Cycle Management
*   Clarium - Supply Chain Management

Furthermore, Clarium 1) promotes a better patient experience and 2) supports and unburdens care teams. Fundamentally, provider organizations have to run best-in-class companies/businesses for health assurance to exist. Clarium's capabilities can drive meaningful efficiencies in the healthcare supply chain to ensure that care is not delayed and organizations are financially optimizing their spend and reducing waste. These gains, both operationally and financially, can alleviate the burden provider groups face today due to complex supply chain management processes run on antiquated systems, allowing them to focus on what matters most: delivering high-quality care. Ultimately, supply chain financial efficiencies can lower the total cost of care provided, and these gains can accrue directly to providers and, more importantly, patients.

## Responsible Innovation

### Founder Mindset

Steve is a founder with a clear mission. With his background and deep understanding of the intricacies in healthcare IT, his motivation for Clarium stemmed from witnessing firsthand the operational inefficiencies in the healthcare supply chain. Recognizing the vast discrepancies and fragmentation in existing systems, Steve embarked on his journey to make healthcare operations more transparent, efficient, and interconnected. His dedication is not only evident in his strategic approach to Clarium but also in his focus on building a team deeply rooted in healthcare and technology expertise. The platform's evolution, from its inception to its traction points, underscores Steve's commitment to a product that addresses core inefficiencies while prioritizing user experience.

### Societal Impact

Efficient healthcare operations directly correlate to better patient care. Current challenges in the healthcare supply chain, from data integration bottlenecks to lack of transparency, have tangible implications on the quality and speed of patient care delivery. By streamlining operations, enhancing visibility across the supply chain, and centralizing information access, platforms like Clarium can not only improve operational efficiencies but also indirectly enhance patient outcomes. In the long run, this can translate to cost savings for healthcare institutions, reduced patient wait times, and overall improved healthcare service quality.

### Possible Unintended Consequences

As with any system that centralizes critical information, there are inherent risks related to data security, privacy, and potential misuse. In the healthcare domain, these risks are magnified given the sensitivity of the data. Over-reliance on a singular platform also raises concerns about potential disruptions should the system face technical challenges. Additionally, there's the challenge of ensuring that the platform remains adaptable to the ever-evolving landscape of healthcare operations and regulations.

### Risk Mitigators

Clarium is deeply committed to ensuring a secure, robust, and adaptable platform. From a technical standpoint, Steve and his team prioritize stringent data security protocols and regular system health checks to ensure uptime and reliability. Furthermore, the platform's modular approach ensures adaptability, allowing for seamless integrations and updates based on user feedback and changing operational needs. Additionally, with Steve's focus on team-building, he ensures that the company is surrounded by individuals who understand the nuances of both technology and healthcare, enabling a holistic approach to potential challenges. Their close ties with stakeholders in the healthcare industry also place them in a strategic position to continuously adapt and refine the platform based on real-world feedback and requirements.
