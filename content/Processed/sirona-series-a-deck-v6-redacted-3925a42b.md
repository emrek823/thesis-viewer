## Slide 3: OUTPATIENT RADIOLOGY HAS A WORKFLOW PROBLEM
### OUTPATIENT RADIOLOGY HAS A WORKFLOW PROBLEM
Poor Workflow Increases Cost & Decreases Quality of Care

**BEFORE EXAM**
*   **Referral**
    *   Referral & pre-cert takes ~30-60 mins of physician & PA time
    *   ↑ Cost
*   **Scheduling**
    *   >14% of referred patients never get scanned
    *   ↓ Revenue

**DURING EXAM**
*   **Scan Acquisition**
    *   High variance in exam duration & inter-patient time
    *   ↓ Efficiency
*   **Interpretation**
    *   ~15 mins per interpretation = limited throughput
    *   ↓ Revenue & Efficiency

**AFTER EXAM**
*   **Results Returned**
    *   ~10% of cases returned to rads for billing-related modification
    *   ↓ Revenue
*   **Administrative**
    *   >20% of patients don't come back for necessary follow up scans
    *   ↓ Revenue & Efficiency

## Slide 4: CURRENT SOLUTIONS ARE OVER-ENGINEERED & UNDER-DESIGNED
### CURRENT SOLUTIONS ARE OVER-ENGINEERED & UNDER-DESIGNED
Poorly Designed, Discrete, On-Prem Software Only Compounds the Problem

+ 2-5 additional pieces of discrete software

## Slide 5: Sirona's Insight
### Sirona's Insight
1.  Radiology isn't just about images, it's about reports.
2.  CV & NLP algorithms work. The distribution is broken.
3.  Doctors seldom pay for quality, but will invest in efficiency.

*Distribute AI through a reporting-centric workflow that drives clinical efficiency.*

## Slide 16: WHY AI & WHY RADIOLOGY FIRST?
### WHY AI & WHY RADIOLOGY FIRST?
Sirona Improves the Efficiency of Diagnosis Today, Entire Episode of Care Tomorrow

Medical images are the heart of orthopedic care.

They determine more than just diagnosis; the geometry of a patient's disease is often the primary determinant of that patient's course of care.
