### GenMD Platform Overview

- Synthetic data generation for healthcare/life sciences
- AI models run behind firewall on-premises
	- Creates “digital twin” replicas of patient populations
	- Generates fake patients that mirror real population characteristics
	- 99.97% of healthcare data currently unused due to privacy concerns
- Low/no-code environment for researchers
	- SQL and R capabilities
	- Build ML models on synthetic data
	- Workflows rerun on real data for final results

### Technical Approach & Validation

- Fidelity as primary focus (80% of development time)
	- Built on improved GAN models vs. 5 years ago
	- Fine-tuned LLMs for clinical text generation
	- Automated fidelity reporting with variable-to-variable analysis
- User validation results:
	- 85% of 40+ Stanford researchers couldn’t distinguish synthetic vs. real data
	- 92% said they would use synthetic data for grant proposals
- Privacy-fidelity tradeoff knob
	- Larger populations enable better privacy + quality
	- Minimum ~30 patients needed for oncology use cases

### Market Strategy & Use Cases

- Initially targeting mid-market vs. top 20 pharma
	- Companies with ~$500K budgets currently buying insights
	- Belief that direct data access preferred over pre-built insights
- Key use cases mirror Komodo Health/Truveta:
	- Sales enablement (40% of Komodo’s revenue)
	- Clinical trial recruitment via patient re-identification
	- Market access analysis
- AI training applications:
	- Shareable synthetic clinical notes for RLHF
	- Turing pays doctors hourly to write fake notes due to HIPAA
	- Potential to sell training data to AI labs

### Fundraising Status

- Raising $4M on $18M SAFE
- $2.6M wired in past 2 weeks
- Looking to close remaining $1.4M in next couple weeks
- Multiple investors in partner call/due diligence stage

### Next Steps

- Virtue team to discuss internally over next few days
- Response by end of week/early next week
- Ayin to keep Virtue updated on fundraising progress
