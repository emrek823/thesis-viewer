### Proposed Structure Overview

- Hank (Flex by Fenwick) proposed Virtue invest in GPV fund as fund-of-funds
	- Only requires LPAC consents on both sides
	- Virtue waives 20% single investment cap
	- Sean becomes GP of GPV fund
- Sarah (Morrison & Foerster) raised concerns
	- Departure from Virtue’s investment strategy
	- Creates flow-through rights issues for LPs
	- Securities law complications with fund-of-funds structure

### Alternative Structures Discussed

- Keep funds separate with co-investment agreement
	- Contract between two funds defining investment allocation
	- Maintains existing fund terms for all LPs
	- Addresses parallel investment opportunities systematically
	- Avoids new LPA requirements
- Combined co-investment vehicle option
	- Each fund contributes to new managed entity
	- More complex with additional flow-through concerns
	- Creates similar issues to fund-of-funds approach

### Consent Requirements Analysis

- Management company changes require LP consent under Advisers Act
	- Both funds need new combined management company
	- GPV has third-party investor in management company requiring advisory committee approval
- Time commitment provisions create potential conflicts
	- Both funds require substantial time devotion from managers
	- Co-investment structure may address allocation concerns
- Parallel fund designation ruled out
	- Fee schedules and carry structures differ between funds
	- Terms must be identical for true parallel fund status

### Next Steps

- Incorporate agreed structure into MOU
	- JS and Stephanie to draft revisions
	- New management company formation
	- LP consents for management change and co-investment agreement
- Sean to coordinate with portfolio company issue, then connect later today
- Both GPs to be appointed to each fund for consistency
