Q: Can you break down the levers of the 2025 MLR guidance, including the impact of IRA changes and the greater-than-expected loss of D-SNP?A: Celeste Mellet, Chief Financial Officer, explained that the improvement in the ratio is primarily driven by the exit of high-benefit ratio MA plans and adjustments to benefits in remaining plans. The favorable calendar in 2025 also contributes. Increases in the ratio are due to business mix changes, IRA impact, and incremental investments. The arrows provided in the prepared remarks indicate the order of size for these factors.

Q: How should we think about the path to achieving a 3% margin, and does it assume any Stars improvement?A: James Rechtin, President and CEO, stated that achieving a 3% margin requires a competitive Stars position, a normalized rate environment, and optimal operating performance in clinical excellence and efficient back office operations. Stars is a crucial part of this, and the focus is on improving these operating levers to allow competitive pricing in the market.

Q: Can you provide details on the few hundred million in investments offsetting earnings growth in 2025? Are these ongoing or one-time?A: Celeste Mellet clarified that the incremental investments are across initiatives to improve operating performance, including Stars and clinical excellence. These investments are not one-time and will be detailed further as the year progresses.

Q: How do you view the integration of Medicare and Medicaid in light of CMS's push for further integration by 2030?A: James Rechtin emphasized that Humana's Medicaid strategy aligns with the integration goals, with a focus on winning Medicaid states and increasing footprint. The integration applies to states with HIDE and FIDE SNPs, and Humana is prioritizing states with dual membership to protect margins and growth.

Q: What is the outlook for Medicaid margins from 2024 to 2025, and will the business reach profitability in 2025?A: George Renaudin, President of Insurance, noted that Medicaid is emerging as a strong business with meaningful earnings potential. While modest margin improvements are expected in 2025, profitability is not anticipated due to the J-curve effect, with 45% of members in states with less than three years of experience. Florida, the most mature state, is performing at expected margins.
