# Integral One Pager

## Introduction & Mission
Integral is a software company headquartered in San Francisco, CA. Integral's mission is to streamline the compliance process required when working with healthcare data for analysis, research, and marketing. We enable companies to work with their desired data in hours, rather than months. This one-pager will outline how Integral works.

## Problem
The current compliance process involving HIPAA experts certifying dataset combinations takes too long and cost too much. This is primarily because there is no technology to bridge the gap between the collaboration necessary between data partners, clients, and vendors and the technical analysis to reach HIPAA expert approval.

## Solution
Integral is a software layer that sits on top of any system to manage the compliance process for integrating healthcare data. Integral has technical analysis and organizational automations to eliminate manual processes and dramatically advance dataset combination go-live timelines.

## How It Works
Integral has 2 key automations enabling companies to work with healthcare data in hours instead of months.

1.  **Real Time Collaboration with Automated Tracking and Documentation**
    Today, the HIPAA certification process requires coordinating with all of your data partners to answer open questions, hosting numerous meetings, juggling email threads to ensure open tasks are completed, and a variety of other manual methods. Integral offers real time collaboration so various stakeholders across companies can collaborate, solve open questions/tasks, and communicate in one easy-to-use platform acting as a single source of truth.

2.  **HIPAA Expert Review Analysis Automation**
    With the current process that exists today, all datasets for a workflow are manually gathered and sent to a consultant to run HIPAA risk analyses. Instead, Integral plugs directly into data systems for continuously monitoring. This enables a suite of automations to run the HIPAA risk analyses as different datasets are populated, as well as providing real time compliance statuses and remediations.
