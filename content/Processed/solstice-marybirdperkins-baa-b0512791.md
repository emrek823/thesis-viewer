# AMENDED AND RESTATED BUSINESS ASSOCIATE AGREEMENT

This Business Associate Agreement (“Agreement”) dated 12/9/2022 (the "Effective Date”), is entered into by and between Mary Bird Perkins Cancer Center and Solstice Health, Inc.

WHEREAS, Mary Bird Perkins Cancer Center (“MBPCC”) is a “covered entity” as defined in 45 CFR 160.103;

WHEREAS, Solstice Health, Inc. (“Business Associate”) is a “business associate” as defined in 45 CFR 160.103;

WHEREAS, MPBCC and Business Associate have or are entering into agreements or other documented arrangements (collectively, “Business Arrangements”) pursuant to which Business Associate may provide services for MBPCC that require Business Associate to access health information that is protected by state and/or federal law;

WHEREAS, Business Associate and MBPCC desire that Business Associate obtain access to such information in accordance with the terms specified herein;

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises set forth in this Agreement and other good and valuable consideration, the sufficiency and receipt of which are hereby severally acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:

1. Business Associate Obligations. Business Associate may receive from MBPCC health information that is protected under applicable state and/or federal law, including without limitation, protected health information (“PHI”) as defined in the regulations at 45 C.F.R. Parts 160 and 164 promulgated pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) and the Health Information Technology for Economical and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH Act”), as amended (the “Rules”). All capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this Agreement shall have the meanings set forth in the Rules. Business Associate agrees not to use or disclose (or permit the use or disclosure of) PHI in a manner that would violate the requirements of the Rules if the PHI were used or disclosed by MBPCC in the same manner. Business Associate shall use appropriate administrative, physical, and technical safeguards and comply with Subpart C of 45 CFR Part 164 with respect to electronic PHI to prevent the use or disclosure of PHI other than as expressly permitted under this Agreement.

2. Use of PHI. Business Associate may use PHI solely for MBPCC's benefit and only (i) for the purpose of performing services for MBPCC as such services are defined in Business Arrangements, and (ii) as necessary for the proper management and administration of the Business Associate or to carry out its legal responsibilities, provided that such uses are permitted under federal and state law and Business Associate obtains reasonable assurances from the third party to whom the PHI is disclosed that the information will remain confidential and be used or further disclosed only as required by law or for the purposes for which it was disclosed to the third party, and the third party notifies Business Associate of any instances in which it is aware the confidentiality of the PHI has been breached. MBPCC shall retain all rights in the PHI not granted herein. Use and disclosure of de-identified health information is not permitted unless expressly authorized in this Agreement or in writing by MBPCC in the Business Arrangements. Business Associate is prohibited from disclosing PHI except as provided in this Agreement.

3. Disclosure of PHI. Business Associate may disclose PHI as necessary to perform its obligations under the Business Arrangement and as permitted by law, provided that Business Associate shall in such case: (a) obtain reasonable assurances from any person to whom the information is disclosed that it will be held confidential and further used and disclosed only as required by law or for the purpose for which it was disclosed to the person or entity; (b) agree to immediately notify MBPCC of any instances of which it is aware that PHI is being used or disclosed for a purpose that is not otherwise provided for in this Agreement or for a purpose not expressly permitted by the Rules; and (c) ensure that all disclosures of PHI are subject to the principle of “minimum necessary use and disclosure," i.e., only the minimum PHI that is necessary to accomplish the intended purpose may be disclosed.

4. Individual Rights Regarding Designated Record Sets. If Business Associate maintains a Designated Record Set on behalf of MBPCC, Business Associate shall (a) permit an individual to inspect or copy PHI contained in that set about the individual under conditions and limitations required under 45 CFR 164.524, as it may be amended from time to time, and (b) amend PHI maintained by Business Associate as requested by MBPCC pursuant to 45 CFR 164.526. Business Associate shall respond to any request from MBPCC for access by an individual within five (5) days of such request and shall make any amendment requested by MBPCC within ten (10) days of such request. The information shall be provided in the form or format requested, if it is readily producible in such form or format, or in summary, if the individual has agreed in advance to accept the information in summary form. A reasonable, cost-based fee for copying PHI may be charged. Business Associate shall accommodate an individual's right to have access to PHI about the individual in a Designated Record Set in accordance with MBPCC's privacy policies and the Rules set forth at 45 CFR 164.520, as it may be amended from time to time, unless the regulation provides for a denial or an exception expressly applies. MBPCC shall determine whether a denial is appropriate or an exception applies. Business Associate shall notify MBPCC within five (5) days of receipt of any request for access or amendment by an individual. Business Associate shall have a process in place for requests for amendments and for appending such requests to the Designated Record Set. This Section 4 of the Agreement shall become effective on April 14, 2003 or on such later date that compliance with the federal Rules is required by the regulations, subject to any earlier state law requirements.

5. Accounting of Disclosures. Business Associate shall make available to MBPCC in response to a request from an individual information required for an accounting of disclosures of PHI with respect to the individual, in accordance with 45 CFR 164 as may be amended from time to time, incorporating exceptions to such accounting designated under the regulation. Such accounting is limited to disclosures that were made in the six (6) years prior to the request and shall not include any disclosures that were made prior to the compliance date of the Rules. Business Associate shall provide such information necessary to provide an accounting within thirty (30) days of MBPCC's request. Such accounting must be provided without cost to the individual or to MBPCC if it is the first accounting requested by an individual within any twelve (12) month period; however, a reasonable, cost-based fee may be charged for subsequent accountings if Business Associate informs the MBPCC and the MBPCC informs the individual in advance the individual is afforded an opportunity to withdraw or modify the request. Such accounting shall be provided as long as Business Associate maintains PHI. This Section 5 of the Agreement shall become effective on April 14, 2003 or on such later date that compliance with the Rules is required by the regulations, subject to any earlier state law requirements.

6. Withdrawal of Consent or Authorization; Restriction of Use or Disclosure.
    (a) If the use or disclosure of PHI in this Agreement is based upon an individual's specific consent or authorization for the use of his or her PHI, and (i) the individual revokes such consent or authorization in writing, (ii) the effective date of such authorization has expired, or (iii) the consent or authorization is found to be defective in any manner that renders it invalid, Business Associate agrees, if it has notice of such revocation or invalidity, to cease the use and disclosure of individual's PHI except to the extent it has relied on such use or disclosure, or where an exception under the Rules applies.
    (b) MBPCC shall notify Business Associate of any restriction on the use or disclosure of PHI that MBPCC has agreed to or is required to abide by under 45 CFR 164.522, to the extent such restriction may affect the Business Associate's use or disclosure of PHI.

7. Records and Audit. Business Associate shall make available to MBPCC and to the United States Department of Health and Human Services or its agents, its internal practices, books, and records relating to the use and disclosure of PHI received from or received by Business Associate on behalf of MBPCC for the purpose of determining MBPCC's compliance with the Rules or any other health oversight agency, in a timely manner designated by MBPCC or the Secretary. Except to the extent prohibited by law, Business Associate agrees to notify MBPCC immediately upon receipt by Business Associate of any and all requests served upon Business Associate for information or documents by or on behalf of any and all government authorities.

8. Notice of Privacy Practices. Upon request, MBPCC shall provide to Business Associate its Notice of Privacy Practices (‘Notice”) when adopted and any amendments thereafter. Any use or disclosure permitted by this Agreement may be amended by such Notice. Business Associate agrees that it will abide by the limitations of any Notice published by MBPCC of which it has knowledge. The amended Notice shall not affect permitted uses and disclosures on which Business Associate has relied prior to the receipt of such Notice.

9. Confidentiality. Business Associate shall take any steps required to (i) protect PHI from unauthorized uses or disclosures and (ii) maintain the confidentiality and integrity of PHI. In accordance with 45 CFR 164.502(e)(1)(ii) and 164, 308(b)(2), as applicable, before Business Associate discloses PHI, Business Associate shall ensure that any agent, including a subcontractor (collectively, “Recipients”), that creates, receives, maintains or transmits PHI on behalf of Business Associate agrees, in writing, to the same restrictions, conditions, and requirements that apply to Business Associate with respect to such PHI. To the extent permitted by law, Business Associate shall be fully liable to MBPCC for any acts, failures or omissions of Recipients in furnishing the services as if they were the Business Associate's own acts, failures or omissions. Business Associate shall report to MBPCC any use or disclosure of PHI not permitted by this Agreement of which it becomes aware, including any security incidents and breaches of unsecured PHI as required by 45 CFR 164.410. Such report shall be made within five (5) days of the Business Associate becoming aware of such use or disclosure. Business Associate agrees to mitigate, to the extent practical and unless otherwise requested by MBPCC in writing, any harmful effect that is known to Business Associate and is the result of a use or disclosure of PHI in violation of this Agreement.

10. Term and Termination.
    10.1 This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall remain in effect until terminated in accordance with the terms of this Section 10, provided, however, that any termination shall not affect the respective obligations or rights of parties arising under this Agreement prior to the effective date of termination, all of which shall continue in accordance with their terms; and provided that the effective date of Sections 4 and 5 shall be in accordance with the provisions of those sections.

        (b) Return or destroy the remaining PHI that the Business Associate maintains in any form;
        (c) Continue to use appropriate safeguards and comply with Subpart C of 45 CFR Part 164 with respect to electronic PHI to prevent use or disclosure of the PHI, other than as provided for in this Section 10, for as long as Business Associate retains the PHI;
        (d) Not use or disclose the PHI retained by Business Associate other than for the purposes for which such PHI was retained and subject to the same conditions set out in Section 2 above which applied prior to termination; and
        (e) Return to MBPCC or destroy the PHI retained by Business Associate when it is no longer needed by Business Associate for its proper management and administration or to carry out its legal responsibilities.
    10.6 The obligations of Business Associate under this Section 10 shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

11. Indemnification. Business Associate will indemnify, defend, and hold MBPCC and its officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns harmless, from and against any and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or related to any third-party claim based upon any breach of this Agreement by Business Associate or similar breach by Recipients (“Claim”). If Business Associate assumes the defense of a Claim, MBPCC shall have the right, at its expense, to participate in the defense of such Claim, and Business Associate shall not take any final-action with respect to such Claim prior written consent of MBPCC.

    14.2 Waiver. No provision of this Agreement or any breach thereof shall be deemed waived unless such waiver in writing and signed by the party claimed to have waived such provision or breach. No waiver of a breach shall constitute any different or subsequent breach.

    14.3 Assignment.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, MBPCC shall have the right to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to any entity that is an affiliate or successor of MBPCC, without the prior approval of Business Associate.

    14.4 Severability. Any provision of this Agreement that is determined to be invalid or ineffective to the extent of such determination without invalidating the remaining provisions of this Agreement or enforceability of such remaining provisions.

    14.5 Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the complete agreement between Business Associate and MBPCC relating to the matters specified in this Agreement, and supersedes all prior representations or agreements, with respect to such matters. In the event of any conflict between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of the Business Arrangements or any such later agreement(s), the terms of this Agreement shall control unless the terms of such Business Arrangements are more strict with respect to PHI and comply with the Rules or the parties specifically otherwise agree in writing. No oral modification or waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be binding on either party.

    14.7 Equitable Relief. Business Associate understands and acknowledges that any disclosure of PHI in violation of this Agreement will cause MBPCC irreparable harm, the amount of which may be difficult to ascertain, and therefore agrees that MBPCC shall have the right to apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for specific performance and enjoining any such further disclosure or breach and for such other relief as MBPCC shall deem appropriate is to be in addition to the remedies otherwise available to MBPCC at law or in equity. Business Associate expressly waives the defense that a remedy in damages will be adequate and further waives any requirement in an action for specific damages by the posting of a bond by MBPCC.

    14.8 Nature of Agreement.
