## Slide 57: Information Lifecycle Management

Confidential & Proprietary 57

*   The cloud storage resources (buckets) have defined retention and archival (nearline, cold) policies as mandated by HIPAA and customer requirements
*   32Health implements soft-delete within the dbs using well defined APIs
    *   We only update the is_deprecated flag in every record and mark them as deleted
    *   The same flag is reverted to restore the records
    *   This is part of the BaseModel which is used by all the models in our APIs
*   Used by all Models and APIs on 32Health Platform

**Retention policy (for compliance) Screenshot:**
*   Prevents the deletion or modification of the bucket's objects for a specified minimum period of time after they're uploaded. The optional setting of "retention mode" to "locked" ensures that no one (including you) can shorten or remove the retention period.
*   Retention period: 10 years
*   Effective date: August 4, 2023 at 12:14:22 PM GMT-4
*   Retention mode: Unlocked
*   Tip: You can save on storage costs by adding a complementary lifecycle rule to delete objects when they reach the end of their retention period.

**`taxonomy_code` table schema:**

| PK | taxonomy_code_id | integer |
|:---|:-----------------|:--------|
|    | taxonomy_code    | character varying |

## Slide 64: Security: Tenancy

Confidential & Proprietary 64

*   Each client's data is logically and physically separated from other clients
    *   A set of database per client
*   Access to the database is via separate IAM service accounts which enforce separation of data
*   Only the Application instance and related services -deployed for client - is authenticated to communicate with db

## Slide 65: Security: Access Control

Confidential & Proprietary 65

*   For external access to the app, we use Auth0 to implement support for multiple roles and groups
*   For internal access, we leverage GCP identity groups and roles created using Cloud Identity/GCP Workspace group & Cloud IAM using the principle of least privileged access and zero trust as much as possible.
    *   Example: prod-users group only has (limited) read access to Prod and the general dev-users has no access to Prod
    *   Example: Machine to Machine auth and general auth within pipeline is via strictly via service accounts
*   Admin access is via a dedicated admin identity group defined at the 32Health org level (GCP best practice) with access to limited authorized personnel. Membership into this group or its privileges cannot be tampered with by project level admins. This is not set via IaaC and is set directly on the console.

*   ❏ Backup, Recovery & Replication
*   ❏ System Processing, Scaling & Monitoring

## Slide 80: Backup, Recovery & Replication

Confidential & Proprietary 80

*   32Health’s supported model is Cloud SaaS
*   Operational DB RPO < 5min
    *   EDA keeps data messages in queue indefinitely
*   BigQuery (99.99% availability), Spanner(99.999% availability) DBs are automatically multi-region with backup and recovery built in
*   For Cloud SQL, planned RTO is 1hr
    *   Data backup to multi-regions and read replicas are easily setup through a simple interface
    *   We are implementing GCP's Backup and DR service to further improve the resiliency
    *   For reads we automatically failover to the read replica. For write failure, we slow down write retries while we recover the db
*   For the application, the external load balancer automatically handles failover
    *   Note that we don't use managed instance groups (compute vms) for hosting the application
*   The system supports replication of the db and configuration info both via the UI and via IaaC
    *   Cloud Datastream is used for Change Data Capture logs. Other instance logs can be easily replicated using a combination of Cloud logging and BigQuery.

## Slide 81: System Processing, Scaling & Monitoring

Confidential & Proprietary 81

*   Hybrid processing architecture supports both Event Driven Architecture (EDA) - primary arch and Batch
*   Our system comprises of microservices and is fully distributed with horizontal scaling based on meeting queue, cpu/memory loads and priority thresholds.
*   Batch processing is implemented using one or more of Cloud Workflows (GCP's pipeline tech), Cloud Data fusion (ELT/ETL tech), Cloud dataflow (Apache Beam) tech.
    *   Common to combine sync and async sub-workflows in a pipeline
    *   GCP's Cloud Scheduler to schedule jobs and start/restart and stop jobs at arbitrary times
*   We leverage Kubernetes underneath and we are able to scale up servers in the 1000s to process millions of records per hour - paper claims, EDI 837D and Eligibility, CSV files for claims and eligibility
*   We use GCP’s built-in load balancing within region and zone and an external/internal load balancer for multi-region https
*   We detect duplicates to improve processing
    *   Cache intermediate step results in the pipeline
    *   Fast composite key hashes (e.g. combining provider, member, claim info, dates of service)
*   For real-time monitoring, we use GCP Operations Suite
    *   Real-time Dashboards
    *   Alerting to phones, slack, email, pager-duty
    *   All resources on GCP stream logs into Cloud Operations Suite
    *   GCP Chronicle in consideration for a native SIEM implementation

- We use scalable compute (Kubernetes) and storage (CloudSQL, Spanner, Datastore,Firestore, vertex ai vector db, elastic search) that can be horizontally and vertically scaled with increased workloads. The servers scale with fixed cpu, memory and queue size thresholds. Memory and cpu increase often correlate to increase data sizes. Data storage is conservatively upper bounded at ~ 700GB per 100K members - Note that this estimate is subject to change

## Slide 103: Implementation Strategy & Perspective

Confidential & Proprietary 103

### Iterative & Agile Phased Implementation Strategy
*   Iterate on the following agile model
    *   Configure Module → Data Conversion → Core Adjudication Engine → Configure Module
    *   Configuration based with minimal code development
*   Reduce human resources and implementation costs by migrating to the 32Health system in an automated and agile process
    *   Bulk load prior claim history, provider and member data, network contracts, fees and hierarchy
    *   Load plans using Document AI to bring over the existing plan designs
*   Data Driven Implementation
    *   Small sample of data, create requirements, outline edge cases/exceptions, iteration with client team for validation
    *   Change Management & Training Incorporated
*   Designed to provide continual value thus mitigating risk
    *   Identify gaps and risks ahead and resolve them immediately
*   Strong Implementation Team
    *   Domain Expertise
    *   Prior Experience with large legacy conversion projects

### Joint Implementation Approach
Within each module, iterate on the following:
*   Work with client SME to gather and validate high level requirements
*   32Health configures the module
*   32Health works with client to gather the data
*   32Health convert/loads data into 32Health platform
*   32Health completes system integration testing for those modules
*   client completes Business Acceptance Testing

This approach has worked well from our past experiences and our current client

## Slide 107: Go Live - In Production Proposed Strategy

Confidential & Proprietary 107

### Strategy A - Begin with one standalone module for one line of business
*   Start with Provider Network Module (recruiting, credentialing, contracting, onboarding) and roll out for one line of business (e.g. Individual or one state or TPA or one business partner)
*   Roll out Provider Network Module for other lines of business
*   Continue rolling out other logical groups of modules
    *   Pros: Quick value realization for recruiting and contracting Providers to client Network

### Strategy B - All modules for one line of business
*   Follow the configuration and implementation plan and roll out one line of business at a time
*   Roll out other lines of businesses in two more phases (least risky lines of businesses first, high risky businesses next)
    *   Pros: Lowest risk, ensuring all kinks/bugs are detected early and mitigated, business exceptions for lines of business are identified, segregated in the planned release, feedback can be incorporated into the next business line that goes live, ensuring client’ clients customer satisfaction and SLAs are not disrupted
    *   Cons: client will have to maintain two systems in parallel for a short period of time

### Strategy C - All modules live at once for all lines of business
*   Least preferred approach
*   Very risky, as minor issues could impact client operations across all lines of business, potentially disrupt the business and have customer dissatisfaction

### 32Health is open to client preferred approach and will work together on deploying client strategy
