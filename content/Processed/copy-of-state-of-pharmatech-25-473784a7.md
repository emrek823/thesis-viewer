## Slide 1: PharmaTech Investment Opportunities

PharmaTech Investmenet
Opportuntiies
By Kunaal Patel

## Slide 2: (Blank)

## Slide 3: Pharmaceutical Data Ecosystem

Pharmaceutical development and commercialization facilitated by advances in data and analytics.

**Diagram: Pharmaceutical Development Process**

*   **Discovery/Preclinical**
    *   Identify and screen molecules
    *   Pre-clinical
    *   Drug discovery analysis
    *   Drug repurposing analysis
    *   *Lower risk but low ROI; Crowded tools market (Latch Bio, Seqera Labs etc.) building relatively undifferentiated tech for a relatively 'small' market (~$18B)*

*   **Clinical**
    *   Phase I
    *   Phase II
    *   Phase III

*   **Commercialization**
    *   Launch
    *   In-use mgmt.
    *   Generics

**Supporting Layers (bottom to top):**

*   Real World Evidence (RWE)
*   Pharmacovigilance
*   Market access: pricing and reimbursement
*   Medical communications: sales and marketing, product and brand management, and patient engagement
*   Market research, competitive intelligence, and portfolio planning
*   Commercial intelligence
*   Clinical development data management

## Slide 4: Pharmaceutical Data Ecosystem

Pharmaceutical development and commercialization facilitated by advances in data and analytics.
But wait... here to market = ~10% chance of success

**Diagram: Pharmaceutical Development Process**

*   **Discovery/Preclinical**
    *   Identify and screen molecules
    *   Pre-clinical
    *   Drug discovery analysis
    *   Drug repurposing analysis
    *   *Ok great so if you solve this you've accelerated drug discovery*

*   **Clinical**
    *   Phase I
    *   Phase II
    *   Phase III
    *   *High risk, high ROI but we still fail here. Point solutions don't work. 80% of trials fail enrollment goals/timelines = ~$600k-$8m/day lost*

*   **Commercialization**
    *   Launch
    *   In-use mgmt.
    *   Generics

**Supporting Layers (bottom to top):**

*   Real World Evidence (RWE)
*   Pharmacovigilance
*   Market access: pricing and reimbursement
*   Medical communications: sales and marketing, product and brand management, and patient engagement
*   Market research, competitive intelligence, and portfolio planning
*   Commercial intelligence
*   Clinical development data management

## Slide 5: Pharmaceutical Data Ecosystem

Pharmaceutical development and commercialization facilitated by advances in data and analytics.
Hard technical problems but most are solvable with the right data/team and display immense ROI opps

**Diagram: Pharmaceutical Development Process**

*   **Clinical**
    *   Phase I
    *   Phase II
    *   Phase III
    *   *AI native cos are just starting to be built...*
        *   (Slope, Zoomlogi, Inato)
    *   *$100B+ market opportunity to accelerate workflows with Agentic AI*

*   **Commercialization**
    *   Launch
    *   In-use mgmt.
    *   Generics

**Supporting Layers (bottom to top), with associated companies:**

*   Real World Evidence (RWE)
*   Pharmacovigilance
*   Market access: pricing and reimbursement
*   Medical communications: sales and marketing, product and brand management, and patient engagement
    *   (Solstice Health, Tycho Pharma - stealth)
*   Market research, competitive intelligence, and portfolio planning
    *   (Prudentia Sciences, Intangia)
*   Commercial intelligence
*   Clinical development data management

## Slide 6: Where to Invest? Major Trends Driving Pharmatech

**Left Column: Major Trends Driving Pharmatech**

*   **Evolving Demographics**
    *   Aging generation → rising chronic disease prevalence
    *   Increased trial protocol complexity (biomarkers, larger patient populations, more endpoints)

*   **Financial Pressure**
    *   Patent Cliff imminent
    *   Increasing complexity of Tx (biologics) driving increased costs

*   **Regulatory Pressure**
    *   Biosecure Act (divestitures from Wuxi Apptech)
    *   Stricter requirements for real-world evidence in approvals & reimbursement decisions
    *   Drug pricing caps → constrained budgets

*   **Personalization / AI enablement**
    *   Specialized manufacturing of higher complexity, low volume medicines
    *   Expectation of AI/ML to accelerate insights across the drug lifecycle

*   **Increasing demand for Pharma tech (data + software)**

**Right Column: Investment Opportunities**

*   Simulations/optimization of trial designs / protocols to enable higher clinical trial recruitment rates

*   Direct enrollment platform to aggregate RWE with real-time health data streams (wearables, EHRs, social determinants) into dynamic, permissioned "patient profiles," enabling AI-driven matching to hyper-specific clinical trials while enhancing cohort diversity through granular behavioral, genetic, and phenotypic targeting.

*   AI-enabled platforms offer transparency into vendor datasets for pharmaceutical companies by detailing aspects like duplication, data longitudinality, and the number of observations across various therapeutic areas. They also identify gaps in real-world evidence (RWE) and autonomously acquire the necessary data to fill those gaps.

*   AI to enhance and speed up end to end of tech transfer + IP/patent filing strategies (ex. Indication expansion like for Keytruda/Humira)

*   AI + robotic automation that scales bespoke manufacturing of personalized medicines and biologics by ingesting historical yield data to optimize processes—such as simulated cell growth and fermentation—for increased throughput and yield
