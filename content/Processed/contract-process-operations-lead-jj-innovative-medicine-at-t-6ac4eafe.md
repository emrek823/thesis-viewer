## Client
Hi. Thanks for taking the time to talk with me. I am interested in learning more about different clinical trial software providers, specifically those that are focused on the execution space when the trials are actually going on. I think maybe to start, if you could give just a little bit of background on yourself and your current role and what types of trials you guys are focused on. Could you maybe just give a little bit of background on yourself and your current role and responsibilities at J&#x26;J?

## Expert
Yes. I sit within a global clinical relations organization and I'm responsible for the engagement with clinical trial, eClinical solution, and payment vendors, managing the contractual relationship, focusing on the operational excellence of some of these activities. You probably know, when you think about execution of clinical trial payments, we have patient payments, we have site payments, and then we have the budgetary management, so more of the internal processes as well. That's where different companies come into play.

We also have to think about the integration of some of these systems, when you need to have these trials integrated with your budget, with your forecasting, your FMV systems, fair market value systems, and when you don't, then is it more external when you're paying patients? Do you need it to be? From a compliance perspective, do you have to think about reporting, transparency, tracking of these payments for open payment reporting? When do you do that and how are these systems going to support you in doing that?

These are the sort of things that we think about. I'd love to hear from you. You're looking at all of these. How are you distinguishing this payment space? The considerations are not the same from a regulatory perspective, from an operational perspective when it comes to the different types of payments.

## Client
Got it. Maybe just a follow-up question to that, can you explain how the payment providers fit in the broader software landscape that you guys are using for these trials?

## Expert
Maybe help me understand, what do you mean by payment providers? Maybe help me understand. Are you looking at clinical payments? Are you looking at payments to subjects? To sites? Let's just make sure that I understand.

## Client
Yeah. I would say all of the above.

## Expert
Maybe let me start at a high level. Greenphire is only for patient payments. It's not for all of the site payments. The reason is because of the integration, just so you know. If we think about Greenphire, we've known that they are the vendor that has been really put in place. They've been really created because they realize that when it came to patient payments, there wasn't any patient subject payments to subjects. There wasn't really nobody who was doing this.

There started to be in the last, let's say, five to 10 years more of scrutiny around how pharmaceutical companies or how manufacturers are paying clinical trial subjects and how are they tracking those payments. There's not necessarily a fair market value calculator in the same way that there is for healthcare providers. At the same time, a lot of companies started to hear regulatory like FDA is really looking at the way that they're paying subjects.

**Sean Doolan**

That's where Greenphire came into play. **DO NOT COPY**
sd@virtuevc.com
They were the only player in the market and I would say they still are who's doing this, which is they understand the regulatory landscape when it comes to subject payments from reporting, from compliance, from tracking. That's for the company. They also realize it for the site. They also realize it for the subjects, how to make it convenient for a subject to just get a card and track what payment is for which activity. The more complex the trials are, the more difficult maybe you come to figure out how these subjects are being paid.

Typically, these are milestone-based activities for sites, but for patients, it may be very different. Sometimes you could also argue, "Hey, if a subject completes this milestone, they should be paid." There's some trials that don't pay them for that. They only pay them not only after the milestone, but also after another test of another milestone. That can be really complex. A lot of sites don't want to deal with this.

What Greenphire realized is it's a burden for all of these stakeholders. It's been the burden for sites. It's been a burden for many factors, been a burden for patients. They took on this challenge and said, "Hey, look, we can help streamline the whole process." They started to study the space. They realized there's really nobody who's doing this.

The companies that are big are Medidata, Ledger Run with their ClinRun system, they are not necessarily doing exactly this. They're not trying to streamline the customer or the patient experience perspective. They're more trying to integrate. That's more of a Medidata. I would say Ledger Run is very similar. They realized, "How can we support the internal processes?" whereas Greenphire was really thinking more externally. If you're a subject in a trial, you want to be paid. How do we streamline your experience to make sure that you can be paid on time?

What it is, is payment gets loaded once the subject is eligible. They track that information. They figure out how to get that information from the sites in a way. The site's tracking if a patient gets paid because they don't get paid unless a patient completes a certain degree, certain activity which is they're hitting a certain.

## Transcript

**Expert:** Milestone. Essentially, Greenphire figured it out. That's I would say what's the biggest difference with Greenphire is that they really do stand out in supporting a lot of these types of pain points when it came to supporting the patient payment experience.

**Client:** Got it. I think maybe to take a little bit of a step back and repeat a little bit of what you just said, but it seems like a huge driver of the need for someone like Greenphire is the complexity of tracking these payments for the patients. Could you give an example of just what a typical trial difficulty would be that makes it so difficult that they need to use a third-party vendor for this? Just a real-life example of something like that.

**Expert:** Yeah. Again, some of this is already streamlined because Greenphire existed for quite some time. Just as an example, let's just say it's an oncology trial, they have multiple arms. Again, you have patients because you have patients in different arms of the trial. You understand what a clinical arm is? I don't need to explain that.

**Client:** Actually, if you could explain, that'd be helpful.

**Expert:** Yeah. A treatment arm is there's different types of treatment groups. For example, you may have one that receives the subject. They receive an investigational drug. An easy arm is two. One is experimental treatment, one is the one who's receiving an investigational drug, the other one is not. In a lot of the oncology, especially trials, there's multiple arms, there's people who receive different doses or different combination of treatments. Imagine now you're complicated. It's not just a placebo. It's easy, one is a placebo.

Those that are in the investigational arm, some of them may receive combination X + B, somebody may receive clinician X + B + C. You can imagine these patients have to be tracked differently. If one is in treatment arm 1A, one is in treatment arm 1B, 1C, or whatever, some patients, you can imagine if they receive three different combinational drug, they may have more tests they need to do. There's burden-associated complexity of that because patients will only be paid if a site reports that a patient has completed a certain number of tests.

Imagine the more complex your combinational drug formula is, the more tests you should do. We want to make sure that this drug is actually working. We want to make sure it's safe. The more complex the intervention, the more complex you can think of the operational activity associated with paying this subject. Does that make sense? I don't want to overcomplicate it because there's a lot that goes into it, but that's a best way to think about it.

If you have multiple treatment arms, not just the pay, you either receive a drug or not, but what kind of drug are you receiving? If you're receiving combinational therapy and you're receiving three different drugs, somebody's receiving two drugs, somebody's receiving four drugs, somebody's receiving three drugs maybe on month one, but month three, you're receiving now this plus something else. Your process around the kinds of tests you need to do, hence around the kinds of activities you do and hence the kinds of payment that you're going to receive after completion of these activities, these are going to look very different.

That's where the complexity comes in. A lot of the more specialized drug trials have a lot more complexity. It's not as simple as, "Hey, you completed it, it's great, get paid." A lot of it is like, "Hey, what did you complete?" Even two different types of subjects who are in different arms of the trial, their milestone activities, their timing for these activities, their payments may look very different. Think about it, if you have maybe three different activities before you can be paid under maybe treatment arm A versus under treatment arm B, sites don't want to own this complexity. This is where Greenphire has come about.

Patients don't need to understand this complexity. Patients basically rely on sites to tell them what they need to do. Manufacturers don't have the time for this. Where Greenphire came about is they realized, "Hey,

we understand the patient experience. We have experience in financial management, we have experience in clinical trial payment from a compliance, from operational perspective. We can redefine that patient and outside experience." That's essentially where Greenphire has come about. Now, by the way, it's very different. I know they've merged with Suvoda. That's different than the recent announcements. I'm just talking about Greenphire arm, not the Suvoda.

## Client
Got it. Our understanding is that there's typically a separate vendor that's doing the randomization and putting the different patients in the different treatment arms. There's the payments vendor such as Greenphire. Are they typically integrated? How does that work?

## Expert
No. By the way, site payments are very different too. You know what? You missed another vendor. What about site payments? Maybe in a biotech, in some companies like ours, Greenphire just takes care of the patient payment. Site payment, somebody else takes care of. Now, I'm not saying Greenphire can't do that, but in a lot of companies, historically, they don't have Greenphire doing it all.

There's another caveat which is not just like you said, your RTSM, your eCOA, your eConsent, your supply chain randomization vendors. There's also another vendor who may be working on budget. There's another vendor who may be supporting travel and logistics. Across each of these, you have multiple vendors. There's just complexity in all of this because a lot of the steps are managed by other vendors.

## Client
Got it. The Greenphire payments, how are they actually tracking when a patient completes? How does that actually work?

## Expert
Yeah. The easiest way is Greenphire is contracted separately between the manufacturer and Greenphire, so separate agreement. In every clinical trial agreement, a CTA is an agreement between a manufacturer, the drug provider and a site, regardless of the site. Could be a site management organization, could be what we call an IRO, an independent research organization, or could be an independent site. Again, you also realize there's different types of sites. Regardless of what it is, you still have a CTA in place. That CTA will indicate who your payment provider is for managing payments per subject. The site is responsible for supporting each payment and registering.

Here's an easy sight, you know how you get a credit card? You sign up for Chase, Chase sends you a card, Chase tells you, "Hey, maybe download the app, register." Very similar. Subject is randomized. The site supports that randomized patient. They're sending them a link to let them know, "Hey, register for Greenphire, you're going to get a card." That card is going to load up money for you like a debit card. It will load up money for you once you're completing these many milestones. That's all it is. It's as simple as that. Manufacturer's out, you don't see it. Sorry, go ahead.

## Client
Yeah. I was just going to ask, who is actually in the platform and using the portal or whatever it is on a day-to-day basis? The patients presumably don't really know. They have their debit card and that's all they need to know.

## Expert
No, they do. They have visibility. Depending on how tech-savvy the patient is, they do have an ability to log in. They don't see as much information, but they see information around what they get paid for. For instance, $95 or whatever it is loaded up on this card, you can now use it. They see that. Sites really have more liberty because they are responsible for making sure that certain visits are triggered. That visit completion trigger dictates whether that patient is now eligible for that payment.

Of course, you have Greenphire who's just managing the logistics, the operations, the financial management.

You have the manufacturer who's more on the receiving end. Remember, as manufacturer, we want to be independent as much as possible. We don't dictate how these patients get paid. The only thing we really care about is reporting.

We want to make sure, let's just say, across this trial how much of the spend has been allocated to our patients and is this what we predicted? For example, if we're saying for trial A, we've seen, I don't know, let's just say $1.2 million allocated to patient payments, we may say, "Hey, is that what we've seen in previous trials?" More so for management oversight, that's what we see.

Compliance, for the most part, that's what we rely on Greenphire for. We're still accountable for making sure these payments have gone through a particular account transparency requirements. For the most part, we heavily rely on Greenphire to support us in a lot of that because they understand some of the regulations behind reporting of patient payments.

## Client
Got it. When a trial is first set up, is there a pretty long setup, programming process with Greenphire so that it's then all automated throughout the life of the process or is it still something that the site has to go in and track and log every time? How does all that work?

## Expert
I would say a lot of trials may have a given trial. If it's an oncology trial, the more complex trial is, the more amendments it's going to go through. If that amendment to the clinical trial protocol impacts patient payments because let's just say a visit was added or requirement was added, that may then require sites to understand, "Hey, you have a step that you need to take care of." Also, there's an impact obviously to the architectural setup, the technical setup of how patients get paid for a certain visit.

For example, if visit one had two components and now it has three components, and maybe now we've paid patients, I don't know, let's just say simple, $50, but now we're going to pay them $60 because there's one more step they need to take, all of these parties who have a responsibility in the process would have to be notified. Does that make sense?

### Sean Doolan

## Client
Yeah, that makes sense.

## Expert
The process can be complex if there's an amendment, but not every amendment impacts the patient payment. Imagine, what if there's something that was added? For example, let's just say decision was we're going to ensure that patients get another blood work at visit five. Visit five, maybe patients were not paid, but now they're paid. It's going to impact because now Greenphire has to know, "Hey, guys, here's an amendment. Patients are now going to be paid more for visit five."

Before, we didn't think about that or maybe we said, "Hey, we're going to add that in, but there's going to be no impact on patient payments. It's a requirement. This is maybe a standard payment that we have to do," then it may not impact. Every time I have to do make that assessment where it's like if there's an amendment to the clinical trial protocol, is there an impact on patient activities and hence processing of payments and payment amount? Again, processing impacts whoever's doing the operations, amount impacts financial management, reporting, tracking, forecasting. That's just patient payments.

## Client
Got it. Would you say it's fair to say that someone like Greenphire is really only relevant for a more complex trial where maybe there's constant amendments or it's just harder to keep track of or do you guys use it for every single trial?

## Expert
I would say Greenphire has really penetrated the market. I don't know, there's probably other companies out

there that can pay patients. You have companies like Tremendous who can issue these debit cards, but I think the problem is it's like, do they understand the clinical trial regulatory environment? I feel most pharmaceutical companies probably are aware of Greenphire.

There's other companies also. There's other companies who can do this. I would say it's who do you trust? One, what are you looking for? If you're thinking, "Hey, what's going to streamline patient experience?" I think you're going to think of companies have done it long enough and that's going to be Greenphire.

If you're saying, "Hey, for us, what's more important is integration and we want to work with the same company who's doing our eCOA, our EDC, our CTMS," that's not going to be Greenphire, at least let's exclude the Suvoda integration. Maybe you're going to pick Medidata because Medidata is your EDC and your CTMS provider, but then are you ready to manage some of the complexity associated with those integrations or are you going to have it separated?

**Client**
Would you say Greenphire's capabilities are significantly ahead of someone like Medidata or the other players in the space?

**Expert**
It's a great question. I would say depends what you value as a manufacturer. Greenphire does not have a CTMS system. They don't have an EDC system. Medidata does. We don't pay sites using Greenphire, we pay patients using Greenphire. Sites leverage Medidata, but Medidata doesn't pay. It's a different payment system to pay. Sites don't get paid the same way. How you pay a site doesn't make sense to use Greenphire because you pay a site, you pay them, I don't know, you continue to process payments. They have start-up payments, all that.

There's just such a volume of payments that you just use probably your own payment systems like your SAP integrated with your EDC and your CTMS. You leverage CTMS. Medidata doesn't give you a payment portal. Does that make sense? You use your own. My point is in those instances, integration is really important because you can't pay a site.

**Sean Doolan**

It doesn't integrate with your current clinical system. Patients are different because of what inputs you're requiring. It's a matter of figuring out what's relevant for you and what are the pain points that you have and which processes, what are you trying to intervene, what are you trying to streamline.

**Client**
Got it. I'd just be curious if you could walk us through, if I were to set up a trial, what is involved with setting up Greenphire to be able to process these payments and what programs is it integrated into and how long does it generally take from the manufacturer's perspective?

**Expert**
Yeah. Again, I don't know when you join the call. Greenphire is used to support patient payments. You're not using it to pay your sites. Just because, again, what I explained, sites get paid a lot more than patients frequency perspective. It's milestone-based. More often than not, you don't have it in the same way that you have it with Greenphire. Let me simplify working with Greenphire, you have to have a CTA first. As you do your study start-up, you're already identifying who's going to be your vendor to support your patient payments.

Within then every trial agreement with the site, once you work with your internal teams to get a CTA template approved, your contract template approved, you're going to include Greenphire and you're going to include instructions there as to how to register. Sites need to support patients in getting registered. You don't want to own that as a manufacturer. You work with sites to make sure that they understand what the requirement is. That's assuming, again, you already have a contract separately with Greenphire. Greenphire is going to support you.

Within that agreement with Greenphire, it's going to indicate what is Greenphire providing you and what are

they providing to every site. You could also imagine, how would Greenphire know which site? There's information that we need to provide them as a manufacturer. There's a given team that gives Greenphire information around which site it is and then they work individually with these sites to help them set themselves up.

If I am, I don't know, [Montebello Medical Center] I'm working with and I have 100 patients I'm going to enroll, every time I have patients that are enrolled in trials, as a site coordinator, I'm setting up an account for them within Greenphire. I know what to do. Manufacturers think out of it. We want to make sure it's as independent as possible. We don't want to influence the patient payment experience because that's between the site and the patient. We care from a Greenphire perspective. Manufacturers make sure the reporting is correct. We don't want to overpay patients for activities that they're not eligible for.

That's where the reconciliation and the audits come into play. That's where your agreement with Greenphire is to make sure that there's some degree of check-ins that are being conducted. There's some oversight the manufacturer does, but you're also asking Greenphire to do those reconciliations as well to make sure.

There's definitely a possibility of, let's just say a patient was paid and triggered a payment, but somehow their visit was not complete. Site may be indicated as complete, but the data showed it otherwise. That's where Greenphire works for the site to say, "Hey, by the way, either you entered the information incorrectly or maybe somehow this test the patient was supposed to do as part of visit two that was indicated completed is not. Did you do it? Did you not?"

There's some logistical activities that are still required because we want to make sure we're doing it as compliant as possible. We're not just paying patients just to be paid. They're paid for completion of every single milestone. How that's defined is driven by the clinical trial agreement because your clinical trial agreement is going to have a budget table. That budget table will allocate what sites get paid and what patients get paid for it.

You can imagine certain visits, a start-up visit, it's not going to have a patient component because the patient is going to be enrolled only after the informed consent. They sign the informed consent. Most patients don't get paid for informed consent. That's Sean Doolan just part of the process. Once you start to maybe do your initial visit and you do blood work, that's when you're going to be paid.

That's where, again, it's important. What if a site somehow triggers payment after informed consent, but based on the agreement, we're like, "No, they shouldn't be paid at this stage"? Let's just say they were paid earlier than they should have. All of those things, somebody has to be checking to make sure that this is what the contract says, this is what the informed consent says. Is the technical setup aligned with the documentation?

That's what I was saying to your colleague earlier. If you have an amendment to the contract and that amendment impacts your budget table, you're going to have to probably modify your informed consent because what if patients consented to this payment process, but your amendment said, "By the way, you're also going to be paid for these visits because we've added this. The trial has shifted. Here's new requirements"?

If there's an impact, all of these parties have to be informed. Greenphire has to update their processes on their end. Patient has to be informed, site has to be informed. That's what I'm saying. The more complex the trials are, the more amendments that often are ongoing and hence the more those changes drive sometimes changes to each of these processes.

## Client
Got it. Is it right to say that the extent of your involvement as a manufacturer is upfront in selecting Greenphire's vendor and their role within the clinical trial? On an ongoing basis, you review the reporting that comes out of their product and make sure that everybody's being paid according to the clinical trial agreement and then on a day-to-day basis, Greenphire is working with the person conducting the clinical trial to set it up and all that stuff. Is that the right way to think about it?

Yeah. I would say from a high-level perspective, that's correct.

**Client**
As a manufacturer, do you have a master agreement with Greenphire that you are going to use them in every clinical trial or in every clinical trial, do you have discretion to select them or not?

**Expert**
We don't usually do it. Imagine how complex that would be. Are you saying if there's a new trial, will we select Greenphire? We think about Greenphire as the right platform for it, but more often than not, if there's patient payments, they're going to be the company. There's no other company.

Yeah. The question was more around do you have a contract with Greenphire that you're exclusive to Greenphire for patient payments?

**Expert**
No. There's no exclusivity clause. Companies typically don't do that.

**Client**
Makes sense. Who were you guys using prior to Greenphire? Was this all done in-house and is that pretty common?

**Expert**
Yeah. There's really nobody else. It's pretty common across multiple companies. Again, think about it, this is patient pay. Here's what would happen before, you'd still pay sites. How else patients would be paid? The question would be, how would patients be paid? Sometimes there would be checks, but the question came how would you track that? There's still an ability to track because then you would require sites.

EDC still tracks patient activities, which visits are tied to site milestones and which visits are tied to patient-based milestones.

You could still see that information. It's just financially would be challenging because you'd be like, "Well, what if the check bounced? Who's going to manage it?" A lot of manufacturers took that on and that's really what the space that Greenphire would say streamlined or disrupted and that they realize, "Manufacturers don't want to deal with this." It's a little bit easier if you have a separate platform that helps you do that.

I would say historically, there really wasn't because Greenphire doesn't have that many competitors. I wouldn't say there's really nothing. There is Ledger Run, but they're not in the same ravine. Greenphire has their own card. They really manage the process end to end for patient payment, if this is what you're talking about. Remember, this is just patient payment.

**Client**
Why do you think there's been no real competitors? Is the market just not really big enough right now for someone else?

**Expert**
Some of this is regulatory environment. You probably know open payments for physicians. There's a lot of companies who support the open payment process because open payments is real. It's a regulation. It still stands. ProPublica publishes information on how physicians get paid. There's a lot of scrutiny around it.

For patient payments, you don't have the same visibility from a risk perspective. Patients get paid. There's certainly probably data available. There's no data that says, "Hey, this company paid this much money for patients." More and more, the pharma industry is talking more about the fact that in the near future, regulations are going to be even more stringent about patient payments. We also want to make sure that from a reimbursement perspective, compliance perspective that patients are not just being solicited.

## Transcript

**Expert:** Systems, and multiple processes governing each step. I would say that's where Greenphire sees, "We're not done. Our work isn't done just because we've streamlined the patient experience. We have so much more to go." I think this is where the integration with Suvoda, which was announced today, is because what they want to try to do is figure out how to integrate with some of the other data collection solutions because they want to be able to be that vendor of choice for all of these things or at least as many systems as possible.

**Client:** Are you guys also customers of Suvoda?

**Expert:** Yeah, but not for everything. They support some of the randomization, eConsent, and ECOA. Actually, eConsent and eCOA, there's multiple vendors because globally, nobody says you have to use one vendor. Study budgets, we are with Ledger Run. We've piloted that solution five years ago and now we're with them. It's just all of these things are not in one system. They never had to be because you're like, "Hey, eConsent is managed by one system, eCOA is managed by another."

I think there's more complexity that rose to the surface. A lot of companies started to realize integration needs to be made possible while historically, a lot of these vendors have been able to provide customized individualized solutions. If you Google eCOA, there's probably five to 10 vendors that can name you. eConsent, same here. Suvoda is just one of them. RTSM, you have to separate it. Randomization is one vendor, supply chain's another.

Yes, you have vendors who claim that they are an RTSM vendor, they can do it all, but they really can't. Think about it, how could you have the same vendor who's doing randomization and the same vendor who's doing supply chain who's shipping the drug? It's just not possible because they're in different phases. You randomize first. By the time you ship the drug, that may be a month later. It's just from a process perspective.

That's where some of these vendors are starting to come together and say, "If we start to integrate and we start to bring these new portals and offerings into the attention of the pharmaceutical company, it might change the way that pharma is starting to look at the way they work with vendors." Ideally, nobody wants to work with 10+ vendors across each of these things, but in reality, that is what happens. For the most part, we have one EDC and one CTMS vendor, but everything else, you might have multiple vendors.

**Client:** Got it. With the recently announced merger, how difficult do you think it'll be to cross-sell the respective products? For example, are most Greenphire customers already using an RTSM solution and whether that's Suvoda or not, they probably don't really need a new one, or do you think that there's actually a pretty large market opportunity there? That would be part of their thesis?

**Expert:** Yeah. I think initially, if I had to guess, they would want to probably combine their networks probably a lot more. One, a lot more companies are probably using patient payments through Greenphire, but probably not as many are using Suvoda across each of these. They probably will have to evaluate who's using eConsent and eCOA. The other thing, a lot of these contracts are going to be separate. A contract for eCOA and eConsent is going to be one contract. A contract for RTSM may be another, even if it's with the same company. I think they're going to have to first clean up their network database and then figure out how do we unify everything.

Again, from a strategic perspective, I think it does make sense for companies to work with one or two vendors, but operationally, it's going to be really difficult. Think about it, again, if you look at the process, the company might have historically said, "Hey, the reason why we want randomization and supply chain to be different is because one, it's managed by different teams." Supply chain is managed by one team, randomization is managed by a whole different team. Maybe they have their own budget.

It's almost like even companies internally, even if Suvoda does come or Suvoda plus Greenphire, whoever.

new name that they decide to come up with, they come and say, "Hey, Johnson, by the way, we have this new offering. What are your thoughts?" I think the conversations internally within the partnership company is going to be like, "Hey, let's do a deep dive. Let's understand what's possible. Maybe we haven't thought about really RTSM integrating with patient payments. Maybe it does make sense."

If we think about how we brought Ledger Run, because Ledger Run we realized how we price, the budgets with forecasting, with clinical planning was all very inseparate. What Ledger Run did for us was a pilot to be able to help us in figuring out which of the processes we could start to use their solutions. If you think about also budget management and financial management, there's other things that come out. There's contracts. Again, there's pricing. I think what I envision will happen, and this is what we did with Ledger Run, is we first would do a pilot. Pilot would be almost like first a deep dive then a pilot. It could be done simultaneously where they can help you.

Let's just say Suvoda comes to Johnson and says, "Hey, we'll be a partner, let's work together through this pilot/deep dive to understand how we can help you in integrating some of your solutions. Where is your burden? Where are your increased cycle times? Where are your site relationships maybe hurting? Let's figure out what makes sense," and through that, develop a strategy to say, "What can we do now? What can we do in the future? What do we require a company to do to make this happen?"

Again, you very likely going to realize J&#x26;J has 10 agreements with multiple companies. Maybe they're going to say, "Okay, when we look at U.S., well, let's take a small subset of trials where they're using similar systems." You also, again, will realize across each of these things, there may be multiple systems, some manual, some third party, some in-house.

You're going to have to figure out, maybe what can we first standardize? You have to come to some agreement that some things are going to have to standardize, some things you're going to have to probably pivot and say, "Okay, maybe there's an exception to this," and then really see how it can be made possible.

I think the vision makes sense because what a lot of CROs are starting to realize is a lot of these eClinical solution vendors want to centralize. They almost want to bring forces together so that a pharmaceutical company could just contract with one organization and they can be the go-to for all of these things. In reality, I think a lot of these companies are starting to also realize that in order to do that, they need to help organizations get there. They almost have to demystify complexity in the means of supporting them and identifying new ways of working.

## Client
You talked about Ledger Run. You use that as your budget solution. Do they also offer payments? As a follow-up to that, does Greenphire offer a budget solution that you guys have evaluated or is there a reason why you keep them separate?

## Expert
Budget management and contract management is very different. Whoever's managing contracts is one team, whoever's managing pricing is another team. If you look at Ledger Run, you'll see they have a budgetary solution, contract solution, planning and forecasting solution, and then the payment solution. For us, we worked with them to help streamline the actual process, not the vendors itself, but say, "Hey, how can we make sure that the resources that are used, the internal processes that are used to figure out how much money is allocated to a given trial?"

That's from budgetary perspective, supporting some of the planning, supporting some of the payments and contracting, it's all coming together. They can give you the portal, but we didn't necessarily work with them for the portal. We worked with them for the process to have a one portal. You have modules that can help you pull in your EDC payments. You almost would pull in your Greenphire payments just to see it. A lot of it is for visibility. That's what I was saying. You almost have to ask yourself the question, what are you looking for? Is this for internal management?

That's where Ledger Run comes in. That's more of an end-to-end process management, or is it more to determine which tool do you need to issue payments? Site payments, are you comfortable with your SAP

## Main Text

solution integrated with your CTMS and your EDC or do you want something different? Patient solution, are you comfortable with Greenphire getting information from integrating with some of your systems like RTSM, EDC, getting that information? Those are the process deep dives that you have to go through to be able to assess what are the pain points within each of those things.

Each thing, around site payments, even if you prepaid budget, budgetary management with sites is one thing. How can we look at previous data to evaluate what do we predict these trials to be? Are those predictions in line with what we've asked for and what we have received?" You need support tools to do that. That's what I'm saying. That's more of an internal management, but those things can help you decide.

If you think about, again, Greenphire is just a tool, but what helps you decide how much you pay patients? How do you know if you should pay $50 for this milestone visit versus $75? What benchmarking are you doing? Now, all those things is where some of the support that Ledger Run can provide you. That's why some of these solutions, I would say they're not necessarily the same.

That's why I wouldn't say Ledger Run is a direct competitor to Greenphire just because their offerings, their capabilities are very different, and that's okay. They play a role in different spaces, whereas I would say Medidata could be a direct competitor because Medidata has EDC and has CTMS and a lot of other systems. Medidata, we run into and by the way, I've done it on a full RFP, multiple RFPs actually on patient payments because we do these quite a bit. I've done them both for site payments and patient payments and then individually for patient payments. Once we've isolated the site, payments should be completely separated.

Medidata, the integration is very powerful, but we did not like how complex the actual experience would be in working with Medidata to support patient payments. We felt like Greenphire just had a very easy solution, "Here's a card, here's a platform, we'll make it for you." It just made sense. I think Medidata just could not replicate that. That's why, again, who are you looking for?

I would say Medidata is more of a generalist. They're not necessarily a specialist because they have so many platforms, whereas Ledger Run doesn't, although I think with integration with Suvoda, it's going to be interesting to see how they might change their ways of working and their offering. That's where I would say you have to look at these and say, "Hey, Sean Doolan are you looking for somebody who can integrate systems?" Maybe the patient experience is not going to be as seamless.

Veeva's another one. Veeva has site payment solution. Veeva has your Vault. Veeva is similar to Medidata, where I think it would be more powerful as a vendor for integration, but I don't think the patient experience is something that they're specialists in compared to Greenphire. It's just a matter of looking at these solutions and realizing what are these companies known for, where do you think their strengths are, and who do you think can deliver on the pain points that you're having at a given moment?

I say at a given moment because I think if a new regulation comes about and now the whole industry needs to track patient payments, we're going to look at these companies very differently than we do today. I think we're going to look at the speed of integrating some of these solutions very differently. We're not right now rushing and say, "Hey, let's integrate with."

That's why I think this integration with Suvoda is going to take some time for companies to process and think because there's no regulation that says you need to be able to report externally how much you're paying patients. I think as we do that, a lot of companies are going to be like, "Mmm." It's good what we have, but the process it takes to get that information, we're pretty much heavily relying on the trust and the relationship that we have with Greenphire.

If you're saying how much of that information showing through EDC and how much through Greenphire, you might see some discrepancy, hopefully not a major, but there's going to be some margin of error because these systems don't talk to one another. Ideally, I think if an FDA comes, they're going to probably say, "Hey, you should get it all from one system. You shouldn't be having multiple systems talking to one another." I don't think FDA is doing that.

I think it's just as companies are starting to prepare for some of these possibilities, that's probably where the integration with Suvoda makes more sense because they're like, "Well, in the future, I think especially as we see a lot of budget cuts across the organization." That's going to happen with inflation, macro,

## Microeconomical Changes Impacting Industry Spending

I think a lot of these eClinical providers are starting to realize like, "Let's combine forces and let's become that go-to vendor so that J&#x26;J doesn't have to structure distinct agreements with three to four eClinical solutions, but they can trust one." At least that's my guess. That's what they're thinking of.

### Client
Got it. I know you mentioned that Medidata and Veeva are more viewed as competitors than someone like Ledger Run. Are you able to use Medidata as your EDC and would that information plug in directly to Greenphire? Do they actually integrate from a tech perspective?

### Expert
They don't, but we do use them. Medidata is our EDC vendor for the majority of our trials. They are a CTMS vendor, but they don't talk to one another. It's not a fully integrated effort because these are competitive. The problem is Medidata doesn't want to share information directly with Greenphire because they know they can steal some of their capabilities and Greenphire does the same thing. It's mostly a manual effort.

### Client
Got it. One last question for me, it's actually a few separate questions. One that we just touched on that I think is a pretty straightforward question, but just curious how the typical contract structure works. What determines any given contract value with Greenphire as a customer?

### Expert
It depends when you start. We're probably in a multi-year agreement, but historically we've had a pilot with them as well. A lot of companies including us start a pilot phase where it's a short-term implementation, see if this is the vendor you want to work with. You typically have a contract where you might have a service component and you have a subscription component because you have access to the portal and then you have access to certain services they may provide.

#### Sean Doolan
As you work with them long term, you're probably relying less on services and more of a self-service model. As you're more comfortable with the platform, there's less enhancements. You've gotten to the point where you're not really looking for them to service you as much as access the platform at any point to get information you need.

### Client
Got it. Is the actual subscription typically based on the dollar of payments or number of patients that you have in the trial? Isn't there a volume component?

### Expert
Yeah. It's the volume component, obviously, volume of data. You could take up transactional. If you're managing millions of dollars, you could assume. It's not really based on spend on volume, but then also capabilities. There's certain enhancements. You're using certain modules from them, you're going to be paying more.

### Client
Got it. Just a summary takeaway question is, how do you guys actually evaluate the ROI of using a solution like Greenphire? Would you say that you guys are gaining value from just knowing that your payments will be compliant with whatever regulatory requirements there are? Would you say it actually increases patient engagement and retention? What do you think is really the reason?

### Expert
Yeah. We can't really look at the first one, compliance because right now there's no regulation that says companies have to report. I think it's the patient experience that Greenphire can report and say, "Hey, by optimizing patient experience by 20%, you can increase patient retention." That makes sense that patients...

who are happy with the way they're paid, if they're paid consistently, they're paid on time, then hopefully they'll remain in the trial because it's an effort for patients. Some patients have to travel, so there's travel.

The other thing, you don't even think about complexity. There's travel costs. How do you assess how much and how do you assess when? Even those pieces, I think having a company who did that, especially we started to look at post-COVID, a lot of people didn't want to travel and they were realizing, "Unfortunately, you can't. You need to get this test on site." Greenphire was managing that. Absolutely, it's a lot of that.

**Client**
That was really helpful. Thank you for taking the time to speak with me. Have a nice day.
