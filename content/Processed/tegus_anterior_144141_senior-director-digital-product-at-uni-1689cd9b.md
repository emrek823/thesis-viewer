**Q: When did you first adopt Anterior either for a pilot/POC or as a customer?**
A: We first started using Anterior in May of 2025.

**Q: Were you the key decision maker / evaluator?**
A: Yes, I was one of the team members who evaluated and chose Anterior.

**Q: What is your use case for Anterior?**
A: We use it for Prior authorizations and payment integrity.

## Client
We're particularly interested in just understanding the prior authorization space and the AI solutions there. We're particularly interested in understanding Anterior, which from our knowledge, you are currently a customer of. Is that correct?

## Expert
That is right.

## Client
Got it. Maybe to kick things off, could you just clarify, at UnitedHealthcare, are you a true paying customer now or are you in an evaluation or are you doing a pilot? We just want to understand the exact relationship.

## Expert
At UHC, we're in a pilot phase with Anterior. I've been a customer of theirs through other healthcare companies that I've consulted for. At UHC, it's in a pilot phase.

## Client
Can you just walk us through maybe your background and also mention what other healthcare organizations you were at that use Anterior?

## Expert
For sure. My most recent role, as you noted at UnitedHealthcare, in a product leadership position. I oversee a few of the key consumer journeys as we define them in the consumer product. It's really consumer experience, corporate, or shared service function. I do work across all of our lines of business, commercial employer plans, Medicare, Medicaid and ACA exchange. The department's divided up into about a dozen teams which each own a set of products focused on a stage of the end-to-end life cycle with UHC as a carrier.

I've been the lead for the coverage and benefits team which is probably most relevant to this, basically ensuring that members understand and best utilize all of the benefits and offerings available that are included with their plan. I'm also in the pharmacy and prescription experiences which could be relevant to this as well, focus on all things, accessing formularies, pricing drugs, placing prescription orders, etc.

I've owned a few of our payment processes and payment experiences as well, basically how members make premium and claim payments, then how we facilitate payments with providers as well, so more capability-focused. I also work as a healthcare consultant to other clients as well. Can't necessarily say specific names, but have served various Blue Cross Blue Shield organizations, a few PBMs and a couple integrated payviders if you will in the industry.

## Client
Quickly on that point, earlier you mentioned that there are other health organizations that you worked with that use Anterior.

## Expert
It is a Blue Cross Blue Shield organization.

## Client
Just to kick things off, would love to just hear what the expected use case for Anterior is, why you guys chose to join a pilot in the first place as well.

## Expert
The expected use case with Anterior is definitely around streamlining and better facilitating prior authorizations both in how health plans navigate that with prescribers and providers in terms of receiving, being able to interpret and make the proper decision, communicate that back and then also how members can track the status of a prior auth, better understand when they are or aren't required and even do some prompting and nudging, not necessarily to request the prior auth themselves like it needs to be provider initiated, but to expedite the process and work around any bottlenecks in terms of missing information or delays on behalf of the provider.

We've basically been able pursued a couple use cases in our member portal as well as in our provider portal and then our mobile app that we make available to drive more digital engagement around prior auths and using Anterior's AI to power a lot of that, both in a chatbot-like experience but also just in a status tracker and more like workflow perspective.

## Client
Could you specifically explain what the company does, what the real product is?

## Expert
Yeah. I think Anterior has use cases beyond the prior auth one I mentioned, but essentially, they're a healthcare AI company that's basically developing agentic and generative AI solutions grounded in my understanding is anything that involves clinical data, clinical decisioning, not necessarily selling them to provider organizations, but trying to streamline those things for how those areas within health plans work, whether it's prior auth departments, medical necessity, clinical reviewers, trying to automate clinical processes within payer organizations.

## Client
Could you be a bit more specific there? We understand the high level but exactly what is Anterior doing that streamlines any clinical decisioning?

## Expert
Sure. They're a platform, so it's all in the use case that their end clients want to pursue or want to automate within clinical, but whether it is how payers are allowing to perform self-service like eligibility checks which happen routinely before a visit instead of picking up the phone and calling the health plan, deploying a solution like an AI agent developed by Anterior on a provider portal or in a mobile app or in some digital assets allow them to do that, like I walked through the prior auth use case, which would be a similar thing, allow that to happen.

## Client
Can you walk just walk through the prior auth use case? Maybe just pick United. How does prior auth work today? What's that flow? I imagine it's relatively complex at times, and there's probably some escalations. Is that done manually? Who within the organization is doing that? What specifically is Anterior doing in the prior auth flow? Is it automating all of it? How does it work?

## Expert
For sure. There are other dependencies and points. If we walk through that use case, an existing member, let's say it's a Medicare Part D member, either PDP or Medicare Advantage, has a lengthy list of medications that they're on. Their doctor has recommended or prescribed them a new medication for some chronic condition. It needs to have prior auth approval before Part D coverage from that insurer will kick in.

The prescriber needs to submit that request to the payer. That could be in a number of different formats. There are standard prior auth formats and that's what we require. It could be literally with a faxed form, it could be through clearinghouse or EDI, or it could be through provider portal. Something like Anterior, that request can be basically ingested by whatever system the plan is using to adjust that.

Anterior can read the prior auth request via API connections, and the AI that Anterior has built out, hopefully summarize and basically instantaneously understand if there is clean enough information in that prior auth request, if it's missing any critical information, if it has any inaccurate information, or if anything is basically missing. It can also be trained to be smart enough, if all the relevant elements are present, at least in our pilot, it would make a recommendation to a clinical reviewer of whether that prior auth should be approved or denied.

Whereas previously, in the past, clinicians have had to spend time doing that all on their own, manually reading through the prior auth request. If things are missing, they need to flag those, communicate it back to the provider. That often results in delays because the provider doesn't see it in timely fashion, don't understand what exactly they need to correct, etc., which leads downstream then to members not having visibility into the status of why they're not getting approval for their drug, is the holdup with the provider, is the holdup with the plan. What's the issue? No visibility into that whatsoever.

With Anterior solutions sitting in the middle of that, we can power status trackers on our member-facing digital assets, in chat channels, in voice channels, and then again, more importantly, we're streamlining and making more efficient the process of automating a great deal of that process and only needing the human clinician reviewer to either review the recommendation or simply sign off on the approval or denial that the technology is recommending.

## Client
As you think about the pilot, the key KPIs that you're benchmarking to understand success, can you share what those are and what thresholds you're hoping to accomplish? If there's some sort of X percent, it gets automated or automated correctly. What are those benchmarks?

## Expert
Yeah, the KPIs we're looking to drive and quantify as many of them as possible, but there's certainly some qualitative elements would be both. From a cost reduction standpoint, we're greatly looking to reduce the amount of time it takes to do all of those tasks, ingest prior auth requests, analyze them, do any manual documentation, summarize, so completely automate that.

Really the benchmark we put is to automate over 50% of the process and then reserve our clinicians to be able to review and make human-in-the-loop-type clinician decisions on approvals and denials. We're looking to take out basically 60% of the time. It takes reduced turnaround times and we're able to track accuracy of our prior auth decisionings after the fact too. We're looking to increase our accuracy under 20%.

A big KPI as well, w. What I focus a lot on is driving call obligation. That would be both between from our members and from our providers, checking on the status of prior auths, needing to remediate any missing or inaccurate data, and need to get in touch with support staff. By automating all of that, hopefully, we're reducing the need for our contact center staff and not just eliminating calls, but also reducing handle time for those that do need to be escalated to a human. It can quickly get to the point of complexity that the human needs to intervene on and not rehash any of the manual points or things that have already been addressed.

We have targets of increasing our NPS and satisfaction scores again both from our members and our providers in terms of their satisfaction with the prior auth process. It's routinely one of our biggest detractors having to deal with prior auths. I think that's pretty consistent across the industry. Even a couple point increases in NPS, even if it still is in the negative overall or whatever, we consider a big success. We have an internal methodology for quantifying the value of each and every point increase in NPS.

## Client
Did you ever meet with the Anterior team?

## Expert
I was on demos and then I met with them several times. I have a point of contact from their team.

## Client
In terms of the evaluation, what other solutions did you evaluate that would be competing with Anterior?

## Expert
We've looked at several. We've looked at some from Anthropic as more of a platform AI solution. We do work with Amazon Lex for a lot of our internal build-outs of AI use cases and developing LLMs and then solutions more specific in prior auth and even actually the Rx prior auth space. We already obviously work with Optum Rx as our in-house PBM. We looked at Surescripts as well as Connecture is a firm we use that's more in the data space for Rx, but those are some of the ones we've looked at either to build out our own LLM in this use case or look at an alternative.

## Client
For Anterior, what kind of prior auth are you focusing on? Are you focusing largely on Rx or complicated procedures? What is the focus?

## Expert
Yeah. We've focused right now for a subset of core medical procedures in imaging and radiology and then we focus on Rx prior auths as well. We have not yet gotten into any ancillary benefit types outside of core medical, like dental or vision or even other medical procedures.

## Client
Just comparing Anterior to the other companies you mentioned, like Surescripts, Connecture, what is the difference in solution here? What does Anterior promise that these kind of older solutions weren't able to deliver on?

## Expert
Yeah. It's been refreshing to work with a smaller, more nimble organization on a use case like this. We actually, I believe, came in contact with them initially through our accelerator program. They at least applied for it where we partner with start-up and firms who maybe have received a round or two of funding for mentorship and guidance and then that has led to us pursuing this pilot with them. That's been refreshing.

I'm not a technologist myself. I sit between business stakeholders and engineering and tech teams as a product person myself to make sure we're prioritizing the right things and serve as a conduit. They appear to have a very compelling and strong AI platform that has grounding in clinical expertise. It's not maybe like some of the other large just tech platform vendors we use that can say they can do anything and everything and yes, maybe have very strong tech, but it's generalized for really any industry.

They seem to be grounded not only even healthcare specifically, but in payers specifically. It's not like they built something for clinicians or for provider or hospital organizations and that are trying to secondarily configure it for payer use. It seems to be built for payers but still grounded in the clinical data, clinical side of things. It's just been good to be able to explore an ove use case with them.

## Client
Could we be more specific here? We understand that there's been a whole host of companies that have claimed to do something like this. There's companies like EviCore and it seems like this has existed for a long time to try to automate prior authorizations. What has not been able to been automated so far in UnitedHealthcare? What is the Anterior doing that's actually enabling these to be processed and what that prior companies weren't?

## Expert
To be quite honest, I don't know if it's necessarily doing anything that we haven't tried before. For one, it's taking out the manual work and all of what used to be just manual data population, manual summarizing of data and basically through the testing we've done and the piloting we've done had a much higher just accuracy rate and success rates in what we're able to auto approve which determinations after the fact are able to be more clinically accurate. The speed of those either auto approvals or even auto denials or when it's very clear that it's a prior auth that should not be approved are far faster than they would have been.

I wouldn't necessarily term it as anything that Anterior is doing that we haven't already tried or thought of. It's just in the results, in the logic and the ability of their LLM and AI model to learn and take in all of our different data inputs from quality, from risk adjustment, from claims history, from eligibility systems. You have those higher metrics in terms of turnaround accuracy and overall performance.

## Client
You mentioned that Anterior can auto-approve or auto-deny prior authorizations.

## Expert
It will come back with it and anything that comes back with a "auto denial" needs to have that sign off from a human reviewer as well. We won't let the system itself auto deny, but it will come back with a denial recommendation. It will actually do auto approvals within the thresholds and things that we have set.

## Client
From our understanding, UnitedHealthcare tried to build this internally, correct? Can you just walk us through why not do this in-house instead of relying on a third-party provider?

## Expert
Yes. We definitely try to build it in-house. I think with something like this, I would still very much consider it a hybrid partnership, buy, build approach just because of the level involvement our tech teams have with integrating the Anterior solution. I think it's been very helpful to have a third party as basic as that sounds to have something to work with out of the box versus we could never seem to quite get it launched from getting proper buy in from stakeholders on what it should or shouldn't do, getting held up on the necessary requirements like defining a product vision basically building from scratch.

Quite honestly, some of the political turmoil that between UHC stakeholders and Optum Rx stakeholders, specifically for those Rx prior auths, the way that has worked is we consume a lot of things that are built by Optum Rx and reuse them in UHC experiences. However, we're not Optum Rx's only client as a PBM. I think they have 18-20 other clients. Never seemed like we could get a priority.

As crazy as that sounds, I know we're in the same enterprise owned by the same parent organization. Having again a smaller nimble company who could work with us very fast on pursuing something and still very much in pilot mode with it has just been way faster than how we've approached it in the past.

## Client
When did you start the pilot and how has it been going so far?

## Expert
Yeah. The pilot really just officially got off the ground in late 2024. I believe Anterior would have been part of that UHC Accelerator program in late 2023 into 2024. Conversations have been going on for a while, but we're able to get sign off from legal and compliance and finance and everyone to pursue a pilot interest. It would have been in November 2024 and I think the pilot's going very well. We've been able to get working prototypes, make design enhancements. The objective is to get really a more in production solution out there in place for AEP, so towards the end of this calendar year by late October at the latest, and all signs are pointing to that being very feasible.

## Client
How does this rollout work? Do you separate it out by the type of prior authorizations used? If Anterior, this goes well, do you start expanding to more procedures? Do you start expanding to more plans? Could you walk us through how you would split this up or how the company plans to split something like this up?

## Expert
This implementation approach or pilot approach is centered on, like I said, a few specific types of prior auths in medical imaging services as well as Rx for a subset of Medicare members and plans to start in this initial scope, Medicare Advantage members specifically, not duals, not group retiree, not med supp members, but purely MA.

Intent is to get the pilot which is fairly lightweight through and in production again towards the end of this year. It will be monitored and the results looked at in early 2026, especially curious how the results and how performance and satisfaction and things come back in what we call our peak season throughout AEP and from there, hopefully, reception is strong enough and performance is strong enough to expand it to other areas of the Medicare line of business. The next logical one would be into some of our dual Medicare, Medicaid populations, although our needs in Medicaid is not nearly where it is at for Medicare. From there, we look to explore it and apply it into our commercial or employer plan segment, but no timetable set on that yet.

## Client
When you think about UnitedHealthcare's priorities and the most important technology in this industry, where does Anterior rank? How much of a game-changer is it if Anterior works?

## Expert
I don't think Anterior is high up on any BTO's list or anything. They're a pretty small organization just getting off the ground. There's much bigger partnerships and things in place with Microsoft, with Amazon Lex on pursuing other AI use cases, but this, again, was a really specific one with the struggle in prior auths. Who knows? Hopefully, it's successful and partnership with Anterior is only able to grow. There's tons of possibilities. Again, they're fairly new. I really have no idea what their ultimate strategy or exit strategy or acquisition strategy, or anything like that is, but I would anticipate any of that is possibilities with them.

## Client
Maybe just talk about how much it costs to run, let's say, a relatively complex imaging prior authorization today without a solution like Anterior.

## Expert
How much does it cost just to do a straightforward imaging prior auth? Is that what you're saying?

## Client
No, a more complex imaging prior auth where you're getting a clinician involved, I assume, and you're hiring a nurse to actually go through it.

## Expert
Yeah. It can be very time-consuming and costly. We're talking one complex prior auth that's going through one of the least happy paths with delays and lots of back and forth between the provider and us as the plan that can drag on for weeks, if not months. That's expensive time from clinical reviewers, contact center staff on status, a whole bunch. We're talking thousands of dollars for one prior auth.

## Client
In the case with Anterior, do you have any estimates? How much of a time saving are you hoping to achieve, let's say, if it's not an auto approval?

## Expert
Yeah. If it's not an auto approval, literally above 50% is our goal and it might be over% time savings. Maybe that's a stretch, but that's what we try to do with our objectives and key results around any initiative. We're looking to literally take out over 50% of the time on anything that doesn't auto-approve to your point and that previously would require a fair amount of intervention from operations and clinical and contact center. We're looking to take out over 50% of that time all around.

## Client
How much would you pay for a solution like Anterior? Let's say that it works for prior authorizations. Can you give us any sense of what the annual spend might be?

## Expert
Annual spend with Anterior?

## Client
Yeah.

## Expert
It's fairly lightweight at this point given we're still in a pilot basis. We're paying to access their APIs and for support time and things. I don't know the specific number just because I'm not seeing the procurement invoices, a couple hundred thousand.

## Client
Let's say that you guys deploy Anterior. You know it works, it reaches the goal of a above 50% time savings. How valuable is that to your company? How much do you think you might be willing to spend for something like that?

## Expert
Yeah. That's again extremely valuable based on increased satisfaction, reduced time, cost savings. We think ROI of something like that is at least a few times what we're going to spend on it. It really depends on the scale. Let's just say within the initial pilot population, we would spend low 7 figures on it next year to expand it across all of Medicare.

## Client
Are you guys customers of any of the other prior authorization solutions that have existed in the past? Even beyond software like Cohere, do you guys work with any of the outsourced BPOs or EviCore or anything like that?

## Expert
Yep, we work with EviCore more so for BPO services as opposed to pure SaaS. We've definitely looked at and explored working with Cohere. It hasn't really come to fruition. Who else? We've been a customer of Connecture as a vendor for a long time, but they're more on powering a lot of the behind-the-scenes data and even some of the renewal and retention shopping experiences on Rx utilization. It's not as specific in the prior auth use case, but those are the ones we have some experience with.

## Client
For EviCore, you said you used it for the BPO essentially. Do you view Anterior as a replacement for what you're using EviCore for now?

## Expert
No, not at all. We view Anterior as a SaaS partner for the core technology and AI capabilities and LLMs. Not at all. We're using other parts of EviCore for resource augmentation and staff support and contractors and things like that.

## Client
If Anterior works though, what do you think happens to the partnership with EviCore? Do you still need as much BPO support? I'm just trying to understand, who do you view as Anterior's competitors within your organization?

## Expert
Yeah. We have a handful of preferred BPO vendors that we use, EviCore being one of them. We definitely still need those for more business operations, keep the lights on type work and engineering support and tech product managers and QA and testing and things. Cohere is definitely a competitor, anyone who has pre-built clinical-based AI solutions for payers, specifically in prior auths. Myndshft, I think, is another one we've looked at. They spell it funny. Those would be the competitors.

## Client
Our understanding is for these prior authorizations, you need to get a clinician to be able to review the prior authorization and approve or deny it. Our understanding was EviCore basically just has a lot of nurses and doctors that people outsource to. Do you not use EviCore for that, or do you use any BPO for that?

## Expert
No, we do. That's what I'm saying. We use EviCore in addition to tech resources, but in clinical resources as well, to expedite or handle a greater volume of clinical reviews today. Long term, we don't want to just address the problem with more resources. We want to find tech replacement and AI automation, and that's what Anterior offers.

## Client
The question behind the question is just when you think about how much you spend on EviCore versus how much you might spend on Anterior, do you think that's similar? Do you think you would have spent significantly less on Anterior, significantly more? How much do you spend on EviCore?

## Expert
We spend way more on EviCore than what we're spending with Anterior for this pilot or even what we would spend with them if we were able to expand it to a greater scope and population. EviCore is used across lines of business as a BPO resource support scale up and down with resources during our peak seasons. There are two different types of vendors, entirely very different bends and scales.

Sure, if we're successful with something like Anterior, it would naturally lead to hopefully less need for all of our BPOs, in this case for clinicians from those BPOs to do as many in-depth clinical reviews of prior auths. There's not necessarily a direct one-to-one correlation there, but that could be an impact for sure.

## Client
Do you have any estimate of how much you spend on EviCore BPO services just getting the clinicians do prior auth?

## Expert
For that specific piece, for all types of BPO services we use from EviCore, it's definitely in the tens of millions annually.

## Client
Can you just talk about Cohere? Why did you guys ever end up working with Cohere?

## Expert
Yeah. We definitely evaluated and I think they're a leader in this space. For whatever reason, I think conversations got quite far. We may have even maybe before my time or unbeknownst to me or something like have similarly done some proof of concepts or test use cases with Cohere. I think given their footprint of other carriers they're working with and stuff, there was some hesitancy there.

Also, when the opportunity with Anterior popped up, it was much more because we had a past relationship with them from the accelerator program. Cohere's at least further along from an organizational development and timeline and funding perspective. Wouldn't rule out working with them. I think maybe we just wanted to pursue something a little smaller and with a specific start-up who again came to us through one of our start-up mentor programs and see where that goes first.

## Client
Do you have any sense of how the platforms are different? What one may be better at or worse at, or did you not evaluate or get close enough to Cohere to speak to that?

## Expert
Part of the, I think, appeal is that Anterior does do more than just prior auth. They do other clinical use cases. Maybe Cohere does as well, but I think they're pretty specialized in prior auth and maybe other interoperability. That's part of the appeal of Anterior's advantage. There's broader interoperability and FHIR protocols and things that we might be able to further streamline and augment.

## Expert
Other than that, I have not seen in-depth demonstrations or things like that of Cohere, so I can't speak to direct comparison of prior auth. I feel like there's probably not a ton of differentiation. Obviously, Cohere is successful and a leader and good at what they do too. That's about the most comparison I can make. I think Cohere is a little bit more positioned for providers as well. I could be wrong there but built for the actual clinical users as opposed to being built for the payers.

## Client
Just at a higher level, how strategic is the entry point of prior auth for a UnitedHealthcare? Obviously, Anterior wants to expand into a ton of other clinical use cases and expand into things like utilization management and care coordination, all these things. Is prior auth the right starting point? Are there other companies that are better positioned to expand into those areas within UnitedHealthcare?

## Expert
Prior auth has intentionally been picked out as a big focal point. Over the past couple years, beyond just the technology and the consumer experience side, UHC released a new Gold Card program and eliminated a bunch of prior auth categories. It's very bullish on the fact that it remains one of if not the top pain point that affects really all sides of the industry, plans, providers, patients/members, not to take anything away from those other areas, like you said, increasing focus on CM, UM, payment integrity, cost and coverage transparency. There's a bunch of chips being placed on prior auth improvement specifically. I personally feel the same that it's a huge opportunity area to disrupt and introduce improvement into the industry.

## Client
Just maybe footing that back with, there's a huge opportunity here. The pain point is very real and it affects all sides of the industry. You made some comments about how it impacts NPS. This seems like a really important thing to get right. Just tell me, I would have imagined the promise of Anterior would be a lot more exciting for you and UnitedHealthcare. If they can automate and save you over 50%+ time on all prior authorizations that are coming into UnitedHealthcare, that seems like it would be a very big deal. I know it's early and they haven't done that yet. Just help me foot the gap in the excitement around that future world and how you've been framing this on the call.

## Expert
No, I think there's tons of excitement around it it and compelling use case. It just doesn't have the scale and the same external-facing marketability as you see with things like us unveiling billion-dollar partnerships with Microsoft on advancing AI use cases and things like that. There's still a ton of excitement around it. It's definitely one of the favorite things I've worked on here and I think has tons of attention.

That excitement, it just hasn't been able to be widely broadcast externally and then there's still just a lot to be proved, like you said, on it as well. The opportunity is extremely real. I think everyone realizes we set stretch goals. It's not going to be in the next couple of months that we eliminate over 50% of our time spent on non-happy paths prior auths. It's a good goal to strive for. We're very encouraged and compelled by what we've seen from Anterior and our ability to work with the technology. I think there's a ton of momentum behind it.

## Client
Another broader question, one of the big, I think, issue or difficulties with this space is obviously the incentives are strange here where honestly for UnitedHealthcare, if Anterior is approving too many prior authorizations, that could lose money to some extent. If they're denying too many, obviously, there's issues there too. How do you guys think about aligning incentives so that Anterior is a truly neutral third party and provides you the ROI you need, but also make sure that they're satisfying any regulatory requirements on being fair?

## Expert
Yeah. That's the double-edged sword in striking the right balance of profitability and just the essence of being an insurer, you can't cover and approve everything. That also to the last question feeds into a little bit of why maybe it can't be showcased as strongly as maybe some other use cases. Sorry, I'm distracting myself with that. What was the essence of your question?

## Client
Maybe put another way, maybe I think I being unclear. Maybe put another way, let's say the Anterior works that it's really good at making the right decision on prior authorizations, but it actually leads to more prior authorizations getting approved. Do you see a world in which Anterior or any of these prior authorization solutions could be negative ROI for you guys just on the fact that more prior authorizations potentially rightly, but do get approved?

## Expert
Yes. Thanks for reiterating that. That is a very real unfortunate reality of anything like this is the right balance has to be struck. I think part of it, quite honestly, is just in policy setting and where prior auths do have a rightful place or don't, educating the market, both everyday consumers as well as healthcare members alike on why there is a purpose behind prior auths, but that is very real. We might realize a major success in ROI on the time savings and the satisfaction level increases.

From a economic or financial viability standpoint as a payer, then if we're just approving everything, or we could be losing our asses on that, so that leads to some hesitation as well and why it really needs to be tested and start small with it and retroactively analyze both the auto approvals as well as the other outcomes that are taking place to make sure of course that they're accurate and right, but strongly analyze the all around financial outcomes and profitability outcomes from it as well.

## Client
Maybe on that incentive and I I know we're up on the hour, how do you feel about Anterior working with providers? Is it possible that they can do both, or would that just be a structural misalignment from your point of view?

## Expert
Of course, they could do both if they chose to. I I think that's what most of the other players do, like Cohere. That can lead to faster growth and certainly increase their total addressable market, and just given, of course, that prior auth touches both the provider and the payer side. I'm a fan of the fact that Anterior is focused solely on payers at this point.

Sure, it might be slowing them down a bit because if they had better access points built out and relationships with more providers, that could accelerate their growth. I think there's a ton of opportunity from an efficiency standpoint on both sides, but especially on the payer side that I tend to like that angle. Of course, I'm biased focusing on the payer side myself. I like it but I have to admit it significantly reduces, again, their market potential and their potential customers.

## Client
My last question is you see technology come and go. Would you put your own money into Anterior if you could invest in them?

## Expert
Yeah, I would. I think they've been great to work with. Again, I'm sorry if it's not coming through fully but excited about the possibilities and certainly the promise of the technology. It's all about fitting it to the right use cases and some of those things that we mentioned on, what is the right level of prior auths to auto approve and stuff. That's a little more independent of the technology, more on how it's configured and the decision-making protocols you put into it. I think, again, the fact that it's geared towards more of a specific healthcare audience is refreshing and strong to me. I think they're super strong and I would invest in them.

## Client
This was a very informative and very helpful call. Have a great week!
