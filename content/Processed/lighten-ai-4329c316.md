## Slide 3: Today's highly human-dependent process is ripe for 100x efficiency gain potential with AI
Today's highly human-dependent process
is ripe for 100x efficiency gain potential with AI

**Process Flow:**
1.  **Structured + Unstructured Clinical Data**
    *   EHR, claims, registries, clinical trial data, etc.
2.  **Variable Extraction**
    *   from notes/PDFs/patient histories, if necessary
3.  **Phenotyping + Cohorting**
    *   Define and encode clinical concepts
    *   Select the right patient group with SQL
4.  **Data harmonization & quality check**
    *   Ensure data make clinical sense
5.  **Analytics + Insights**

**Bottlenecks:**
*   **Often relies on manual human labeling.**
    *   Can take up to months.
*   **Involve manual literature/codes search or clinician consultation.**
    *   Can take up to months.

We build the end-to-end automation flywheel
using LLMs for clinical data wrangling and information retrieval

**Process Flow (Automated):**
1.  **Structured + Unstructured Clinical Data**
    *   EHR, claims, registries, clinical trial data, etc.
2.  **Variable Extraction**
    *   from notes/PDFs/patient histories, if necessary
3.  **Phenotyping + Cohorting**
    *   Define and encode clinical concepts
    *   Select the right patient group with SQL
4.  **Data harmonization & quality check**
    *   Ensure data make clinical sense
5.  **Analytics + Insights**

Existing players only solve pieces of this workflow, many still done manually.

## Slide 5: Phenotyping + Cohorting: AI could reduce the workload by weeks to months
Phenotyping + Cohorting:
AI could reduce the workload by weeks to months

**User Query:**
*   "How many people have diabetes in this dataset?"

**Phenotyping:**
*   "Diabetes defined as at least 2 ICD-10 code E11 OR 2 high HbA1c measurements within 30 days"
*   All manual today
*   Takes up to weeks/months

**Cohorting:**
*   Wrangle and slice data to build patient cohort
*   Existing engines are inflexible
*   "I'd rather write my own code.” - J&J scientist speaking of Aetion

**Our solution for a 5x efficiency gain**
*   LLM for retrieving clinical definitions from publications & clinical guidelines
*   Interactive user editing with community voting and curation
*   Dynamic cohorting engine
*   LLM-enabled data wrangling & code generation

## Slide 6: (Quote slide related to Phenotyping and Cohorting)
"Finding code lists and phenotyping definitions is the biggest bottleneck to get any study off the ground. Sometimes it takes a few hours, but often times it takes a few weeks or months for one clinical concept. If there is a good vendor solution, we would use it. But we haven't seen any."
– Director of Global Medical Affairs at Pfizer

"At Komodo, we had a team of 30-40 that only focuses on medical codes curation and mapping. It's a massive team and is core to Komodo's business. I think there is a huge opportunity to use Gen AI here."
– Komodo alum
→ a simple calculation: medical codes curation and mapping is 3-4% of Komodo's revenue (Staff cost is ~$6-8M/yr; Komodo's revenue is ~$200M/yr)

**Two camps of existing solutions both fall short**

| Category                  | Examples                                     | Limitation                                      |
| :------------------------ | :------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
| **Off-the-shelf NLP**     | Google Cloud, AWS, MDCLONE, John Snow LABS, KAIDhealth, ScienceIO | Can't extract complex clinical relationships    |
| **Train your own ML with human-curated training data** | MENDEL, flatiron, Centaur Labs, intellis | Cost to extract one custom variable ~$100-150K |

**Our solution for a 5x efficiency gain**
*   Replace human-curated training labels with AI-enabled fuzzy labeling grounded in medical ontology

## Slide 9: (Quote slide related to Data quality checks)
“We can charge more than other data vendors because we have a really robust internal data quality check system and can market our data as the best-in-class. Most vendors don't have the resources to do this."
– Quantitative Scientist at Flatiron

"One of our biggest pain points is that we don't trust the data quality from our data vendors."
– Director in HEOR at Bristol Myers Squibb
