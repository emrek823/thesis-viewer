COLLABORATION, MARKETING, AND LICENSING AGREEMENT

This Collaboration, Marketing, and Licensing Agreement (the “Agreement”) is entered into as of July [___], 2024 (the “Effective Date”), by the American Dental Association (“ADA”), and 32Health Inc. (“32Health”). ADA and 32Health are sometimes referred to herein individually as a “Party” and together as the “Parties.”

BACKGROUND

A.	The Parties entered into a Term Sheet dated on or about May 9, 2024, and this Agreement is the definitive agreement contemplated by that Term Sheet.

B.	The Parties believe that coordination of credentialing and re-credentialing between providers and payers for delivering dental care can reduce overall costs and can improve timely patient-centric care. The Parties will collaborate to standardize delegated credentialing processes and information delivery, improve credentialing and recredentialing experiences between providers and payers, and deploy a scalable solution leveraging 32Health technology (including artificial intelligence (“AI”) algorithms and models) as further described below.

C.	32Health has developed a proprietary, cloud-based, AI-powered real-time credentialing and re-credentialing enterprise software platform (the “Platform”).

D.	ADA desires to (i) collaborate with 32Health to achieve the foregoing and other mutually agreed objectives; (ii) have 32Health operate and make a version of the Platform available on an ADA rebranded basis (the “ADA Branded Platform"); and (iii) market and promote such ADA Branded Platform to ADA members, including interested dentists, small groups and dental support organizations (“DSO”) as described in this Agreement.

E.	32Health will operate and make available the ADA Branded Platform in accordance with this Agreement and share a percentage of net amounts 32Health receives and retains in connection with the ADA Branded Platform, as further described below.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and the covenants set forth in this Agreement, and other good and valuable consideration, the sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the Parties, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:

Collaboration and Going to Market.

General Collaboration and Appointment. Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, 32Health and ADA each appoint the other as a collaboration partner relating to credentialing and recredentialing processes and technology. The Parties will collaborate to standardize and improve such processes and technology as mutually agreed, including as initially described in Exhibit A.

Marketing and Branding Licenses. Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, 32 Health hereby grants ADA (and mutually agreed ADA affiliate(s) (each an “ADA Affiliate Entity”) a license to market and promote the ADA Branded Platform to its members, dentists, small groups, and DSOs (each, an “End Customers”), and ADA hereby grants 32Health a license to use and incorporate ADA’s designated marks and branding on the ADA Branded Platform. ADA will be responsible for ensuring ADA Affiliate Entities comply with applicable portions of this Agreement as if they were ADA (whether or not expressly stated).

End Customer Relationships. End Customers accessing or using the ADA Branded Platform must agree to 32Health’s terms and conditions for access to and use of the ADA Branded Platform and pay 32Health applicable fees for such access and use. 32Health’s terms, conditions, and pricing for the End Customers and ADA Branded Platform will be generally consistent with 32Health’s then current generally applicable and published terms, conditions, and pricing for the Platform, as reasonably adopted for the context and subject to the other provisions of this Agreement.

Restrictions. ADA will not (and will not permit any ADA Affiliate Entity, End Customer, or other third party to), directly or indirectly: (i) interfere with, disrupt, alter, translate, or modify (other than as expressly contemplated or permitted under this Agreement) the ADA Branded Platform or any part thereof, or create an undue burden on the infrastructure underlying the ADA Branded Platform (or the Platform it was derived from); (ii) reverse engineer or decompile the ADA Branded Platform (or the Platform it was derived from), in whole or in part, for any purpose, or use, access, or otherwise reference the ADA Branded Platform (or Platform it was derived from) to build a competitive product or service or a solution using similar ideas, features, functions; or (iii) use, access, distribute, resell, or make available the ADA Branded Platform or Platform other than as expressly permitted under this Agreement. Except as expressly set forth herein, no express or implied license or right of any kind is granted regarding the Platform or ADA Branded Platform or any part thereof.

End Customer Support. 32Health will provide credentialing and onboarding customer support for End Customers who license or subscribe to the ADA Branded Platform in connection with this Agreement. Such customer support will be provided (i) by personnel located in the continental United States of America; (ii) during 32Health’s business hours; and (iii) in accordance with the support 32Health generally provides its other customers.

Platform Security and Controls. 32Health will comply with all security and privacy guidelines agreed by the Parties for healthcare transactions that are applicable to 32Health and its Platform, including SOC 2 Type 2 compliance. 32Health will also work toward achieving HiTrust and other mutually agreed certifications. During the Term, the Parties will further detail these security requirements. If the costs of compliance are materially greater than anticipated, the Parties will discuss through governance how to address such situation.

Governance. The Parties will form a governance committee, made up of senior management personnel from each Party (the “Governance Committee”). The Governance Committee will meet periodically to discuss and evaluate the relationship and the ADA Branded Platform, including End Customer pricing, projected revenue, costs, roadmap of future updates and enhancements thereto, compliance with security requirements, each Party’s roles and responsibilities (as initially set forth in Exhibit A or otherwise agreed in writing) and other mutually agreed topics. If the Parties disagree on any issue, the Governance Committee will use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve any such issue.

Economic Terms.

Collections and Operating Costs. 32Health will be responsible for collecting fees from End Customers (“Revenue”) and 32Health’s operating and other costs associated with the ADA Branded Platform, including hosting, support, third party licensing, tax, and other costs and expenses (“Operating Costs"), as determined using generally accepted accounting principles. The “Net Amounts” mean the Revenue collected by 32Health less such Operating Costs, in each case associated with the ADA Branded Platform.

ADA Share. 32Health will pay ADA a percentage of the Net Amounts as further described in Exhibit B (the “ADA Share") on a monthly basis in arrears.

Payment and Reporting. Within thirty (30) days following the end of each month, the ADA Share payable by 32Health to ADA will be paid to ADA. At least annually, the Parties will review, forecast, and/or reconcile actual versus forecasted amounts and make any reconciliation adjustments as required by Exhibit B or otherwise agreed in writing.

Intellectual Property.

Background and Foregoing Intellectual Property. Each Party will solely own and retain all right, title, and interest in and to its Background Intellectual Property and Foreground Intellectual Property. No Party will have the right to practice or exploit the other Party’s Background Intellectual Property or Foreground Intellectual Property, unless explicitly provided otherwise in this Agreement.

“Intellectual Property” means all patentable and unpatentable inventions, works of authorship, or expression, including computer programs, data collections and databases, AI algorithms or models, trade secrets and other Information. “Information” means any and all ideas, concepts, data, know-how, discoveries, improvements, methods, techniques, technologies, systems, specifications, analyses, products, practices, processes, procedures, protocols, research, tests, trials, assays, controls, prototypes, formulas, descriptions, formulations, submissions, communications, skills, experience, knowledge, plans, objectives, algorithms, reports, results, conclusions, and other information and materials, irrespective of whether or not copyrightable or patentable and in any form or medium (tangible, intangible, oral, written, electronic, observational, or other) in which such Information may be communicated or subsist. Without limiting the foregoing, Information includes any technological, scientific, business, legal, patent, organizational, commercial, operational, or financial materials or information.

“Background Intellectual Property” means any Intellectual Property of a Party that was developed, created, conceived, or acquired by or on behalf of, or was owned or controlled by, such Party before the Effective Date. The Platform constitutes 32Health’s Background Intellectual Property.

“Foreground Intellectual Property” means any Intellectual Property that one Party made, invented, developed, created, conceived, reduced to practice, or acquired, or that becomes owned or controlled by such Party, after the Effective Date during the Term (as defined below), in the conduct of activities outside of, or otherwise independent from work performed under, this Agreement.

License to Background Technology.  Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, each Party hereby grants to the other Party a nonexclusive, royalty-free and fully paid license (without the right to sublicense) to use its Background Intellectual Property for the sole purpose of the other Party performing its obligations or exercising its rights under this Agreement.

Derivative Intellectual Property. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, each Party (the “Owning Party”) exclusively retains all of its rights, title, and interest in and to any derivative works or improvements made to its Background Technology (collectively, “Derivative Intellectual Property”), regardless of whether the Owning Party or the other Party (or its affiliates) developed such Derivative Intellectual Property, solely or jointly. To the extent that the other Party (or its affiliates) has or acquires any ownership interest in the Owning Party’s Derivative Intellectual Property or any intellectual property rights therein, the other Party agrees to assign and hereby irrevocably assigns to the Owning Party all of its right, title, and interest in and to such Derivative Intellectual Property and all intellectual property rights therein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, ADA hereby irrevocably assigns any derivative works or improvements to the Platform (or ADA Branded Platform, excluding only ADA Marks) to 32Health and will cause each ADA Affiliate Entity to do the same. Any feedback, suggestions, or improvements 32Health provides to ADA regarding ADA processes will be owned by ADA. Any feedback, suggestions, or improvements ADA or (an ADA Affiliate Entity) provides to 32Health regarding the Platform (or ADA Branded Platform, excluding only ADA Marks) will be owned by 32 Health, and all rights, title, and interest therein are hereby irrevocably assigned to 32Health.

AI Learnings. The Platform (including the ADA Branded Platform but excluding only ADA Marks) includes AI algorithms and models, and any improvements or learnings associated therewith (but not any underlying personal information or ADA, ADA Affiliate Entity, or End Customer data) will be deemed Derivative Intellectual Property owned by 32Health.

Branding and Marks. Each Party hereby grants to the other Party a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license during the Term to use its respective trademarks and logos (“Marks”) for the purposes contemplated under this Agreement, subject to the other provisions of this Agreement. Each Party will comply with the other Party’s guidelines and policies made known to it regarding such other Party’s Marks. Each Party acknowledges the other Party’s exclusive ownership of its Marks and agrees not to claim any right, title or interest in or to the Marks of the other, or to apply for registration or register any of the Marks used by the other in any jurisdiction. All goodwill created or otherwise associated with the promotion, marketing, distribution and support of a Party’s products and services and the trademarks and trade names associated therewith during or following the term of this Agreement will accrue directly to the benefit of such Party and will be the sole and exclusive property of such Party. The ADA Branded Platform will include ADA Marks and attribution (such as “powered by 32Health”) as agreed by the Parties.

Joint Intellectual Property.  If the Parties decide to jointly develop any Intellectual Property that is not Derivative Intellectual Property, the Parties will enter into a separate addendum to be attached hereto delineating their respective rights in and to such Intellectual Property.

Miscellaneous. There are no implied licenses granted under this Agreement, and all rights not expressly granted herein are reserved to their owners. Each Party agrees to execute any documents and make any filings necessary to confirm and effectuate the intent of this Section and cause its affiliates and its and their personnel to do the same.

Confidentiality.  “Confidential Information” means any nonpublic information of a Party (the “Disclosing Party”), whether disclosed orally or in written or digital media, that is identified as “confidential” or with a similar legend at the time of such disclosure or that the receiving Party (the “Receiving Party”) knows or should have known is the confidential or proprietary information of the Disclosing Party. Information will not constitute the other Party’s Confidential Information if it (i) is already known by the Receiving Party without obligation of confidentiality; (ii) is independently developed by the Receiving Party without access to or use of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information; (iii) is publicly known without breach of this Agreement; or (iv) is lawfully received from a third party without obligation of confidentiality. The Receiving Party will not use or disclose any Confidential Information except as expressly authorized by this Agreement and will protect the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information using the same degree of care that it uses with respect to its own confidential information, but in no event with safeguards less than a reasonably prudent business would exercise under similar circumstances. The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information to its affiliates, employees, and representatives as necessary to perform its obligations or exercise its rights under this Agreement and will causes such affiliates, employees, and representatives to comply with confidentiality restrictions consistent with this Section. The Receiving Party will take prompt and appropriate action to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information. If any Confidential Information must be disclosed to any third party by reason of legal, accounting or regulatory requirements, the Receiving Party will promptly notify the Disclosing Party of the order or request and permit the Disclosing Party (at its own expense) to seek an appropriate protective order.  The Parties acknowledge that any breach of the obligations in this Section may result in irreparable, immediate and continuing damage to the injured Party for which there will be no adequate remedy at law, and each Party agrees that in the event of such breach the injured Party will be entitled to seek injunctive relief and other equitable remedies in addition to all other remedies available by law.

Warranties; Disclaimer.

Mutual Warranties. Each Party represents and warrants that: (i) it is a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing in its jurisdiction of incorporation and principal place of business; (ii) it has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute, deliver and perform its obligations hereunder, and (iii) it will comply with all laws and regulations applicable to the performance of its obligations hereunder. Each Party further represents and warrants that it will perform its obligations in accordance with industry leading practices.

DISCLAIMER. EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT, EACH PARTY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, INTEGRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ACCURACY AND ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES ARISING FROM STATUTE, COURSE OF DEALING, COURSE OF PERFORMANCE OR USAGE OF TRADE.

Indemnification.

By 32Health. 32Health will defend, indemnify, and hold ADA and each ADA Affiliate Entity harmless against all costs and reasonable expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees), damages, and liabilities arising out of any third party claim that any use of, or access to, the 32Health Background IP (including the ADA Branded Platform, but not the ADA Marks) as expressly authorized under this Agreement infringes or misappropriates, as applicable, any patents, copyrights, or trade secrets, provided that ADA gives 32Health (a) prompt written notice of such claim; (b) authority to control and direct the defense and/or settlement of such claim; and (c) such information and assistance as 32Health may reasonably request, at 32Health’ expense, in connection with such defense and/or settlement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, 32Health will have no obligation or liability to the extent that the alleged infringement or misappropriation arises from (1) the combination, operation, or use of the 32Health Background IP with ADA related Marks, branding, data, products, services, materials, technologies, business methods or processes not furnished by 32Health; (2) modifications which were not made by 32Health; or (3) ADA’s breach of this Agreement or use of the Background IP other than in accordance with this Agreement (collectively, “IP Exclusions”). Upon the occurrence of any claim for which indemnification is or may be due under this Section, or in the event that 32Health believes that such a claim is likely, 32Health may, at its option (i) modify the Background IP so that it becomes non-infringing, or substitute functionally similar services, platforms, deliverables, or documentation; (ii) obtain a license to the applicable third-party intellectual property; or (iii) terminate this Agreement on written notice.

By ADA.  ADA will defend, indemnify, and hold 32Health and its affiliates harmless against all costs and reasonable expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees), damages, and liabilities arising out of any third party claim that any use of, or access to, the ADA Background IP, including ADA Marks, infringes or misappropriates, as applicable, any patents, copyrights, trademarks, or trade secrets, provided that 32Health gives ADA (a) prompt written notice of such claim; (b) authority to control and direct the defense and/or settlement of such claim; and (c) such information and assistance as ADA may reasonably request, at ADA’s expense, in connection with such defense and/or settlement.

Limitation of Liability.

IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY (OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES) BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY LOSS OF REVENUE, SAVINGS OR DATA) ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ADA BRANDED PLATFORM BASED ON ANY THEORY OF CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, NEGLIGENCE, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

A PARTY’S (INCLUDING ITS AFFILIATES’) TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES EXCEED THE NET AMOUNTS DURING THE PRIOR TWELVE (12) MONTHS FROM THE LAST EVENT GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY. THIS IS AN AGGREGATE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND NOT A PER CLAIM OR INCIDENT LIMITATION.

THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY WILL NOT APPLY TO THIRD PARTY CLAIMS FOR INFRINGEMENT SUBJECT TO INDEMNIFICATION, THE UNAUTHORIZED USE OR DISCLOSURE OF THE ADA BRANDED PLATFORM OR OTHER CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT.

Term and Termination.

Term.  The initial term of this Agreement will commence from date of the Effective Date and continue for a period of six (6) years, unless earlier terminated pursuant to this Agreement (the “Term”).

Termination.  In the event there is a material breach by either Party then the non-breaching Party may give written notice to the breaching Party demanding the breach be cured, and if not cured within one hundred twenty (120) days from the date of such notice, then the Agreement is immediately terminated. 32Health may terminate this Agreement upon ninety (90) days written notice to ADA in the event that Revenue is below the Operating Costs for two consecutive years.

Effect.  Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason: (i) the licenses granted hereunder will terminate, except to the extent necessary to fulfill then current obligations to End Customers for a reasonable wind-down period; (ii) each Party will promptly return to the other Party all copies in its possession or control of the other Party’s Confidential Information and will certify in writing to the other Party within thirty (30) days of such expiration or termination that it has fully complied with the terms of this subsection; and (iii) applicable Sections will survive as necessary to give effect to the intent, including payment, disclaimers, limitations of liability and miscellaneous provisions.

Miscellaneous.

Most Favored Nation Terms for the ADA. During the Term, 32Health will not provide to any similarly situated alliance partner, who desires to offer a white-label version of the Platform similar to the ADA Branded Platform, financial terms that are materially more favorable than those contained in this Agreement, taken as whole.  If such occurs, the financial terms hereunder will be adjusted to provide ADA the same or better financial terms.  This provision does not apply to trials or proof of concept offerings.

Audit and Other Review. Either Party or its designated representative may reasonably review the other Party’s (or its affiliates’) books and records to confirm compliance with this Agreement, including the ADA Share and compliance with information security obligations, once per year in accordance mutually agreed audit and review plans. 32Health will make available copies of SSAE 18 or other audit or control reports as generally provided to its customers or channel partners as reasonable requested. If any audit or review determines that ADA Share due and owing to ADA has been under-reported or not been paid as required, then a reconciling payment will be made by 32Health to ADA.

Independent Contractors.  The Parties hereto are independent contractors. Nothing in this Agreement will be deemed to create an agency, employment, partnership, fiduciary or joint venture relationship between the Parties.  Neither Party (nor any agent or employee of that Party) is the representative of the other Party for any purpose and neither Party has the power or authority as agent, employee or in any other capacity to represent, act for, bind or otherwise create or assume any obligation on behalf of the other Party for any purpose whatsoever. No Party will be deemed as a third-party beneficiary to this Agreement.

No Assignment; Amendment.  Neither Party may assign this Agreement or any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement, except with the prior written consent of the other Party; provided, however, that this Agreement may be assigned without such consent in connection with a merger, reorganization, acquisition, or sale of all or substantially all of the assets of a Party or as a collateral assignment to its creditors.  This Agreement may be modified or amended only by a separate written agreement executed by the Parties expressly modifying or amending this Agreement.

Notice.  Any legal notice or other communication required or permitted to be made or given by either Party pursuant to this Agreement will be in writing, in English, and will be deemed to have been duly given: (i) five (5) business days after the date of mailing if sent by registered or certified U.S. mail, postage prepaid, with return receipt requested; (ii) when transmitted if sent by facsimile or email, provided a confirmation of transmission is produced by the sending machine and a copy of the notice is promptly sent by another means specified in this Section; or (iii) when delivered if delivered personally or sent by express courier service.  All notices will be sent to the other Party at the address for notice specified in the signature block or at such other address as the Party may specify in a notice given in accordance with this Section.

Disputes.  At the written request of either Party, the Parties will attempt to resolve any dispute arising under or relating to the Agreement through the informal means described in this Section. Each Party will appoint a senior management representative who does not devote substantially all of his or her time to performance under the Agreement. The representatives will furnish to each other all non-privileged information with respect to the dispute that the parties believe to be appropriate and germane. The representatives will negotiate in an effort to resolve the dispute without the necessity of any formal proceeding.  Formal proceedings for the resolution of the dispute may not be commenced until the earlier of:  (i) the designated representatives conclude that resolution through continued negotiation does not appear likely; or (ii) thirty (30) calendar days have passed since the initial request to negotiate the dispute was made; provided, however, that a Party may file earlier to avoid the expiration of any applicable limitations period, to preserve a superior position with respect to other creditors, or to apply for interim or equitable relief.

Governing Law and Venue.  The laws of the State of Delaware will govern this Agreement and any dispute arising hereunder without giving effect to the choice of law provisions thereof.  Any legal suit, action, or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement will be instituted exclusively in the courts located in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.  Each Party waives any objection which it may have or hereafter to the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding, and irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in any such suit, action, or proceeding.

Entire Agreement.  This Agreement, including its schedules, attachments, and exhibits, contains the entire understanding of the Parties relating to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all prior written or verbal and all contemporaneous verbal agreements and understandings relating thereto. Any terms in any purchase order which conflict with the terms and conditions of this Agreement or any terms on any pre-printed document will be without legal effect and null and void.

Attorneys’ Fees.  The prevailing Party, whether plaintiff or defendant, in any legal action or other proceeding to enforce this Agreement or as a result of a dispute, breach, or default under this Agreement will be entitled to recover (in addition to whatever other remedy to which it may be entitled) its attorneys’ fees and other costs incurred in connection therewith in addition to any other relief to which such Party may be entitled.

Further Assurances.  Each Party will execute and deliver any and all additional papers, documents, and other assurances, and will do any and all acts and things reasonably necessary in connection with the performance of its obligations under this Agreement or to carry out the intent of this Agreement.

Severability.  If any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable, such provision will be fully severable and this Agreement will be construed and enforced as if such illegal, invalid, or unenforceable provision never comprised a part of this Agreement and the remaining provisions hereof will remain in full force and effect and will not be affected by the illegal, invalid, or unenforceable provision or by its severance herefrom.  Furthermore, in lieu of such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision, there will be added automatically as part of this Agreement a provision as similar in its terms to such illegal, invalid, or unenforceable provision as may be possible and be legal, valid, and enforceable.

Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original, but both/all of which together will be deemed to be one and the same agreement. Counterparts may be delivered via electronic mail (including PDF or any electronic signature complying with the U.S. federal ESIGN Act of 2000, e.g., www.docusign.com) or other transmission method, and any counterpart so delivered will be deemed to have been duly and validly delivered and be valid and effective for all purposes.

In Witness Whereof, the Parties have caused this Agreement to be executed as of the Effective Date.
