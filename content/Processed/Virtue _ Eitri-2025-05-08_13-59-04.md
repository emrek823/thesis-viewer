### Skylark Implementation Deep Dive

- Found through cold LinkedIn outreach in February with head of technical operations - Tom Gulgeary
- Advisor connection with Anjul Giri (https://www.linkedin.com/in/anjilgiri/) who is highly motivated to be advisor
- Fast implementation timeline: First contact Feb 7, followed by 4-week fundraising pause, then 2.5 months to scoped implementation
- Skylark profile: Pre-clinical gene therapy company at optimal timing for engagement

### Knowledge Transfer Framework

- Process Gap Analysis / Facility Fit

- Comparing pharma company process requirements against CDMO capabilities
- Identifying differences and needed adjustments

- Artifact Generation

- Writing batch records and documents for plant operations
- 2-8 month process of writing/reviewing initial batch records

- Manufacturing Data Tracking

- Tracking data from manufacturing runs
- Ensuring product meets specifications
- Cross-referencing against previous capabilities

### CDMO Integration (Forge)

- No direct interaction with Forge to date
- Current workflow: Forge sends data back to Skylark with minimal guidance
- Takes Forge 2-3 weeks to collect and curate data into Excel format
- Forge positioning:
	- Markets as modern CDMO (acquired for $620M, serving 35+ gene therapy clients)
	- Still uses paper batch records despite modern positioning
	- Practical reality: Paper better than iPads in hazmat suits
	- NLP/LLMs now make processing handwritten documents significantly easier

### Product Development Status

Data Sources:

- Earlier stage process development data
- Productivity metrics from 5L batch runs
- Quality data measuring product specs
- Multiple Excel spreadsheets
- Scanned batch records

Key Metrics:

- Titer from batch reactor
- Recovery percentages from purification
- Quality measurements (e.g. viral capsule gene loading)

### Technical Implementation

- Brought on Chris Sue part-time (10-15 hours/week) for May
- Building initial database to visualize cross-batch data
- Developing pipeline to ingest Forge batch record scans
- Demo to wider Skylark team scheduled in coming weeks

### Strategy & Next Steps

- Using Skylark as learning partner for smaller biotech implementation
- Planning to leverage implementation details for demos with 3-4 other small biotechs
- Exploring larger CDMO strategy (Catalent, Lonza, WuXi biologics)
- Need to identify key executive contacts at major CDMOs
