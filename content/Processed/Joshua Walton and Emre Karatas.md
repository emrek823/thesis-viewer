### Joshua’s Bio Foundation Model Work

- Built multimodal foundation model moving between different data modalities
	- Histopath data analysis
	- Compound biomarkers for patient-drug matching - got most traction here
	- Inferred phenotypes and omics from various data sources
- Worked on this for ~1 year, stepped away couple weeks ago
	- Had deals with Novo Nordisk, Organon
	- Co-founders wanted to be researchers, not founders
- Plans to eventually return to bio foundation model space
	- Considering end-to-end platform for probability of success prediction
	- From initial molecule/biomarker through trial design and patient matching
	- Speaking with CROs this week about probability success applications

### Current Projects & Opportunities

- Revenue cycle/scribe project with former boss from Haddon House Hospital
	- AI scribe listening to patient conversations
	- Automatic clinical coding based on insurance
	- Medication prescribing based on insurance coverage
	- Advent Health signed LOI for 50 clinics
- Teleradiology opportunity through friend’s father
	- Runs one of biggest telerad companies in US, no AI currently
	- 60,000 scans per week with data retention rights
	- Unlimited imaging data access potential
- Market challenges identified
	- Talent competition against OpenAI offering millions
	- Pharma skeptical of AI - need internal champion
	- Research-based companies can be “boomer” businesses

### Next Steps

- Emre to connect Joshua with Standard Model Bio team (Kevin Brown)
	- Company training multimodal foundation models for pharma
	- Focus on imaging, pathology, radiology
	- About to raise $10-20M+ in January
- Joshua to send one-page overview to Emre for Standard Model introduction
- Follow-up conversation next week to discuss Standard Model meeting
- Joshua considering multiple parallel opportunities rather than single focus
