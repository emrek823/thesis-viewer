Only two health insurance companies are slated to offer marketplace health plans in central Illinois next year, [halving the amount of insurance issuers](https://idoi.illinois.gov/content/dam/soi/en/web/insurance/consumers/documents/2025-il-exchange-plan-analysis-eng-final2.pdf) the region currently has as Aetna and Health Alliance announced they will be exiting the insurance marketplace in 2026. However, Aetna will still offer Medicare plans next year.

In addition, health policy nonprofit KFF estimates the average cost of monthly premiums for central Illinoisans will increase by at least 65% as a result of federal tax credits expiring.

All the while, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois – the only company that covers the entire state – is proposing to raise rates at the highest clip of any health insurer in Illinois.

Health Alliance, which is based in Urbana and issues the second-largest share of all health insurance plans in Springfield, [stated](https://news.healthalliance.org/news-releases/regional-individual-and-group-insurance-plans-discontinuing-in-2026/) it would be discontinuing group health insurance plans next year as it “struggled to achieve operational and financial efficiency” amid rising costs of health care, marking the end of an Illinois insurer that has been in business for nearly 35 years.

Aetna already exited the marketplace once before in 2017, a few years before CVS Health’s [$69 billion](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/28/cvs-creates-new-health-care-giant-as-69-billion-aetna-merger-closes.html) purchase of the insurer was finalized. The American Medical Association [continuously protested the merger](https://www.ama-assn.org/health-care-advocacy/access-care/cvs-aetna-merger), alleging it would violate federal antitrust law and “likely harm patients.”

The National Association of Benefits and Insurance Professionals, or NABIP, noted in a May press release this is now “the second time in a decade” Aetna has exited the insurance marketplace “and will leave nearly 1 million enrollees seeking new health insurance options” across the country. Although NABIP acknowledged the decision was a part of “broader market headwinds,” the trade organization “warns of the cascading impact this move could have on health care access.”

Tax credits introduced with the Affordable Care Act, which were then expanded and extended by the Biden administration in 2021, are set to expire at the end of 2025. Such credits have been recognized as making marketplace health insurance reasonably affordable for more than 90% of recipients, according to the [Center on Budget and Policy Priorities](https://www.cbpp.org/research/health/premium-tax-credit-improvements-must-be-extended-to-prevent-steep-rise-in-health). Cuts to Medicaid could result in fewer options for care – regardless of a patient’s insurance status – as health care providers that rely on Medicaid reimbursement could cut staff, decrease service hours or even close clinics.

Brokers from the Illinois chapter of the National Association of Benefits and Insurance Professionals, or NABIP-IL, told *Illinois Times* that almost 100,000 people would be affected by Aetna’s and Health Alliance’s exit. They also warned of how people on marketplace insurance plans should expect to pay substantially more for health care next year.

“Everybody is going to see a decrease in their tax credits, drastically,” said Melissa Shepherd, a licensed broker who was recently appointed to an advisory committee for the upcoming state-based marketplace. “Compound that with the fact that carriers are asking for large (rate) increases this year.”

The lack of tax credits means insurance enrollees may feel the brunt of rate hikes for the first time in years. Last year, the average monthly premium that marketplace enrollees in Sangamon County were charged was near $850 before tax credits brought the average down below $200.

Health insurance companies filed their [initial rates](https://idoi.illinois.gov/consumers/consumerinsurance/health/affordable-care-act%2D%2Daca%2D%2D%2D%2Dillinois-rate-filings.html) for 2026 with the Department of Insurance last month; half of all submitted insurance plans increase the average premium rate by double digits, including a nearly 30% average increase for Blue Cross plans. Blue Cross also submitted the highest rate increases for next year’s individual and small group plans, though all companies proposed decreasing rates for their [lowest-level plans](https://www.healthcare.gov/choose-a-plan/plans-categories/) on the individual marketplace.

Rates are finalized after the Department of Insurance reviews filings submitted by insurers.

Keeping in line with the national average, about 90% of central Illinoisans on marketplace insurance plans have government subsidies to help them out, according to KFF, the nonprofit formerly known as Kaiser Family Foundation.

Shepherd said the tax credits are likely expiring due to “bad actor” insurance agents who, with access to enrollee personal information, switched people over into [zero-premium plans](https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/aca-obamacare-plans-switched-without-enrollee-permission-investigation/), even if they shouldn’t have qualified based on their income level.

Sherri Stewart, a licensed broker at American Central Insurance in Springfield, said Illinois had few zero-premium plans due to state mandates requiring more coverage from health insurers.

“That was an unintended consequence of the tax credits being expanded,” Stewart said. “It did happen in other states; it was very rampant.” The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services [finalized rules last month](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cms-finalizes-major-rule-lower-individual-health-insurance-premiums-americans) that aimed to limit federal spending and increase a variety of eligibility checks.

Sara Walker-Hite, a licensed broker and president of NABIP-IL, said while it was not something that happened in Illinois, “we all certainly pay the price.”

Aetna and Health Alliance’s exit may open the market for Blue Cross Blue Shield’s Health Care Service Corporation, which already issues more than half of all health insurance plans in Springfield, according to the [American Medical Association](https://www.ama-assn.org/system/files/competition-health-insurance-us-markets.pdf), and insures more than 500,000 Illinoisans.

Blue Cross and Springfield Clinic, a provider that claims to serve almost one million patients across nearly 100 locations in central Illinois, had a public standoff during contract negotiations in 2021 that resulted in the insurer removing Springfield Clinic from in-network coverage for almost two years. The two companies eventually [struck a five-year deal](/news-opinion/springfield-clinic-blue-cross-make-a-deal-17851422) that categorized Springfield Clinic as an in-network provider through 2028.

This spring, Springfield Clinic laid off almost 70 employees while citing nationwide economic concerns and “insurance reimbursement constraints,” according to an internal memo obtained by *IT.*

Get Covered Illinois, the state’s health insurance marketplace, has a [frequently asked questions](https://getcovered.illinois.gov/resources/faq%2D%2D-insurer-changes-for-2026-marketplace-coverage.html#faq-whyismyhealthplangoingaway-faq) webpage about changes to next year’s marketplace. In addition to the department sending out more information in October, Get Covered Illinois plans to have call center representatives available “to help people choose a comparable plan.”

Although open enrollment doesn’t begin until November, Illinois has a network of navigators that can provide free, in-person assistance any time of the year. Springfield has two such navigators: Springfield Urban League and Central Counties Health Centers. Visit [getcovered.illinois.gov](http://getcovered.illinois.gov) to schedule an appointment.

Editor’s note: A previous version of this story incorrectly referred to Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois as a for-profit company when it is a licensed nonprofit, though state Rep. Sue Scherer [floated the idea](https://www.illinoistimes.com/news-opinion/blue-cross-fined-339000-by-state-14890906) of removing its tax-exempt status in 2022.

1. Obamacare DESTROYED the health insurance industry. What we have now can’t honestly be called health insurance. It’s a putrid, decaying mass which is circling the drain ever more quickly.

   Imagine if car insurance worked the same way as our “health insurance” does today…someone crashes their car into Baskin Robbins and the car bursts into flames. The person exits the burning car, walks over to State Farm, and buys a car insurance policy. Then, State Farm is forced to cover the cost of the accident.

   Requiring health insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions signed a death warrant for the entire industry. The commies who have been crying for a government healthcare system will get it sooner than they know, and they will get it good and hard.

   Instead of a 4 hour wait in the ER, they will have an 8 hour wait. Instead of a 2 month wait to see your doctor, they will have a 6 month wait. Instead of being forced into bankruptcy after a life-saving surgery which they can’t afford, some bureaucrat will deny them the surgery outright and then they will crawl into a corner and die.

   Thanks Obama!

2. We have been headed for a shortage of physicians for years, particularly in rural areas. This is a huge contributer to long wait times to see physicians. Obama care has provided many with an affordable way to get health insurance. It was never intended to be the final answer. But while people complain about it, government has done nothing to improve on it. There are many moving parts and requires direct input from many industries including insurance professionals, hospitals, physicians, pharmaceutical companies, consumers, and others. What we get is lip service from politicians who have no idea what American families endure.

3. This reminds me that less government is better government. I am 81 and heavily dependent on health care. Prescriptions include $1,000 monthly necessities that are $50 with insurance. Open heart surgery became a necessity when 2 arteries were blocked. Thank God we have Aetna. Oh wait , Aetna is dropping out because of patients like me.

4. You can thank the democRatic party for this. Force the insurance company to pay for unnecessary things and this is what happens. The same thing happened in California, the democRats are too stupid to see what they are doing.

5. The only way to lower medical costs is to get rid of insurance altogether. In pre-ACA days, insurance only benefited the healthy and wealthy.

6. Never had insurance before Medicare….now it looks like I’m screwed. How can I afford health insurance on 2200 a month [spouse included]  
   Policy went from 150 to 190 and Rx from 9.99 to 49.00 a month. Then there is the home owners insurance. Car insurance.
