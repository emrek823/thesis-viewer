# Gyde | Investor Monthly Overview

## November 2025

### Summary

November was another meaningful month of company building and execution for Gyde. We continued to scale our technical organization with the addition of two exceptional engineers who spent time at Oscar and Ramp respectively, and have hired our first Head of M&A, Fredric. We have also formally opened searches to fill the remaining foundational roles across the company, including Head of HR, Head of Data, Front-End Engineer, Value Creation Director, and Product Designer. These hires will expand our leadership bench, unlock our ability to scale M&A and product simultaneously, and ensure we enter 2026 with a complete, high-performing team.

On the product side, we saw significantly above-expected engagement and automation performance in both our MA and ACA renewal flows. Appointment booking rate and auto-renewal volume are all trending well above our campaign targets, giving us confidence in both the near-term conversion impact and longer-term commercial advantages of our agent-led workflows (performance snapshot below). Perhaps the most encouraging feedback has been the glowing reviews we've received from broker users. A couple of examples: “I don't know how I would have survived Q4 without Gyde” and “I love Gyde. Thank you for the service y'all provide. Some of my people believe it's a real person, that's how intelligent it is”. We kicked off development on our cross-sell application, which builds on the success and infrastructure of our Renewal agents.

M&A momentum remained strong. We conducted onsite visits for Avid and BenaVest under LOI, and advanced diligence materially across both opportunities. Each is highly likely to close and remain attractive as our first partners from a value creation standpoint. While late-stage deals are not moving as quickly due to the time of year, our broader pipeline also deepened meaningfully: we scheduled 30+ intro meetings with agency owners post-AEP/OE. Combined with our search for a Head of M&A and continued discipline in sourcing, we expect a further uplift in top-of-funnel velocity heading into Q1. We are still working to move Capstone to LOI signature, but expect to get there by EOY. We have one additional target that has accelerated in the funnel, and could sign an LOI by mid-January if we can align on deal structure.

From an organizational standpoint, we finalized plans for our first company-wide onsite, which will be held in Austin on December 11–12, and we secured office space options in both Austin and NYC to support in-person collaboration as the team expands. We also continued preparation for our public launch: we selected our PR partner for the late-January Gyde launch announcement(s) and completed the website, marking a major milestone in our readiness for external visibility. In next month's update, we will provide more guidance to you around our launch plans, how we are sequencing the initiatives across stakeholders, and where we need your support.

As we move toward year-end and into 2026, our focus remains on:

1. Finalizing & onboarding key hires
2. Executing diligence and closing for partners under LOI
3. Accelerating product development velocity
4. Generating top-of-the-funnel momentum to fuel pipeline

### Key Needs, Reminders, or Asks

1. World-class full-stack engineering recommendations, with a focus on those with expertise in building Voice AI products. This remains a top priority as we increase product velocity, expand AI enabled communication modalities, and prepare to onboard new partners.
2. Reminder to please avoid any public announcements or disclosure of involvement with Gyde until the PR launch in late January. We will provide more details, coordination guidance, and shareable materials as we get closer to the date.

### Renewal application early metrics

**Gyde AI Renewal Campaign Overview**

**Renewal AI Agent outcomes are trending 2-2.5x above target across Consumer LOBs.**

| Line of Business (Timestamp: 11/15) | Campaign Start Date | Clients Engaged | Response Rate To Date | Scheduled Appt. Rate | Auto-Renewal Rate |
| :---------------------------------- | :------------------ | :-------------- | :-------------------- | :------------------- | :---------------- |
| Medicare                            | 10/15               | 317             | 39%                   | 10%                  | 9%                |
| Individual & Family Plans           | 11/3                | 696             | 36%                   | 11%                  | 6%                |
| **End of AEP / OEP Target**         |                     |                 | **20%**               | **8%**               | **6%**            |
| **Aggregate Pace for End of AEP / OE** |                     |                 | **50%**               | **15%**              | **15%**           |
| **Expected Performance vs Target**  |                     |                 | **2.5x**              | **2.5x**             | **2x**            |

*   The Medicare campaign has reached a 39% response rate, well above the overall campaign goal we set at 20% (based on industry benchmarks), and the IFP campaign is pacing even faster after 3 weeks of activity
*   We expect response rates to continue to rise with additional follow up attempts and natural urgency towards the end of the enrollment period
*   We're particularly excited about the auto-renewal rate, which represents a significant amount of time savings for the broker and can be directly invested into driving net new growth
*   The appointment booking and auto-renewal processes are both receiving glowing feedback from design partner and users

\*Target driven by talking to brokers in the market regarding what "market leading is, Will's experience at Oscar, and Sam's experience at Spark and tied to +5% growth assumption in revenue model

## October 2025

### Summary

October was a big month for Gyde. We signed our first two LOIs (Avid, Benavest), and received a verbal confirmation to move to a third (Capstone). We shipped our first AI application and are now live with our design partners. Our team continues to be built out and has maintained a world-class talent bar, with key additions from organizations like Stripe, Vista Equity Partners and Resurgence, Oscar, and Bain & Company. Finally, we signed a preemptive term sheet with Lightspeed for our Series A and are now actively working to add another anchor capital partner to the round. We welcome questions, but would ask that this not be socialized externally. While we want to remain largely silent in terms of major public announcements, we launched our homepage to strong reviews from external stakeholders. As we move towards 2026, our focus will now shift to filling key leadership roles (e.g. CTO) and executing our Value Creation plan for our acquired partners.

The combination of Avid, Benavest, and Capstone will bring us an estimated $55-$60M in revenue and ~$5M in EBITDA as we enter 2026. It also reinforces that our M&A machine can acquire assets in all three of our target segments, without an over-reliance on our own rolodex to drive deal flow and LOI signatures. While we recognize we still need to get through diligence and closing, we view the ability to get to this point in ~14 weeks as a strong signal. Looking out further, the pipeline looks strong and we have 3-5 candidates that we believe could move to LOI signature in 1H of 2026. While we acknowledge our mid-funnel performance is strong, we still believe we are underperforming in driving top-of-the-funnel action. Our model relies on our ability to execute a high-velocity M&A motion, which requires significant top-of-the-funnel lead generation. Right-sizing this will be a core focus for us, and reinforces why we are now searching for a Head of Growth.

We have started to roll out our Renewal Application to a small cohort of members on our design partner's books. The SMS-based agent is automating the scheduling of consultations, intaking auto-renewal requests for members who don't need a meeting, and collecting other clinical, financial, and living situation data. The latter can include things like needing help with SNAP (also an income proxy) and adding adopted children to their family / policy, both of which are real examples from information Gyde's agent is ingesting. We will have more information to share here as we get deeper into AEP / OEP, and launch the ACA agent on 11/1.

From a team perspective, we have added full-stack, ML, and infrastructure engineering talent with the addition of Andrew, Michael, and David (now full-time), built the foundation for our Value Creation function with Nick and Christian, and added Holland as our Chief of Staff. We continue to focus on CTO recruiting, identifying candidates to fill the Head of Growth role, and, longer term, opportunistically looking at leaders for our M&A function.

### Key Needs or Asks

## Page 5

*   Adding world-class full-stack engineers to the team remains a core focus for us, so we continue to welcome introductions to those with 5+ years of experience and strong pedigrees.
*   We are hiring a Head of Growth to supercharge our top-of-the-funnel M&A efforts. We'd welcome any intros here, particularly those in BD or Origination at Lower Middle Market PE firms or leading sales at high growth software companies.
*   Please hold on announcing or disclosing your involvement with Gyde until mid-January. We are coordinating a larger launch announcement and will provide guidance to all of you as we get closer to the date.

## August 2025

### Summary

The month of August was primarily focused on developing our M&A pipeline and accelerating our product development efforts as we move towards a 10/15 launch of Gyde's first AI Application: Renewal Automation. We remain active in filling out our launch team, particularly key leadership roles.

From a pipeline development perspective, we have started moving prospects into more formal proposals, and we have achieved our goal of having 10+ qualified deal conversations by 8/15. Our model is winning high praise from prospects, who have repeatedly indicated that they have not seen an approach or talent roster like Gyde's before. However, we are finding that many of our prospects have never been through a formal end to end sale process, so we need to do a fair amount of education around how a buyer arrives at a valuation, Gyde's process, deal structure, etc. This insight is not necessarily surprising - we are targeting a mid-career owner who still has ambitions to grow, which may require slightly longer deal cycles relative to the aging owner who is running a process. We will adjust our M&A outreach, meeting cadence, content, and sequencing to account for this, and plan to increase the time we spend with targets in person.

On the product development front, we are rapidly developing the Renewal Automation application. We have completed the build of our foundation data models, which will fuel the Application, AI-enabled experience, and foundational infrastructure work. As we move into the latter half of August and September, we'll kick off the development of the AI agent for the Application and automate the SMS / voice-based renewal experience. We've also built of the V1 of the Application's Operator UI, which will serve as the core managerial dashboard to view members engaged by the Application. We are bringing on an AlleyCorp Nord to own the development of our Broker Dashboard, which will free up more time for Enrique and George to focus on building the core agents that fuel the Application. You can find a snapshot of our Product Roadmap below, and we have conducted kick-off discussions with three design partners to socialize our approach to Q4 and beyond.

We have kicked off a formal search for our CTO, led by True, and continue to actively recruit for another AI Engineer and a Head of M&A. We have brought on David Winder and Ryan Procaccini to support us from a fractional Infrastructure Engineering and M&A perspective, respectively, with both being candidates for full time roles in the future. We've also brought on Dan Marshall as a GTM / Ops Associate to streamline our M&A process and machinery, improve our outbound motion efficiency, etc.

We have completed our brand design and continue to progress forward towards our Q4 launch, which we've included below. We will keep you all posted as we finalize the go-live date for websites and / or other externally facing pieces of content.

As a heads up, we expect that we may not see material top of the funnel movement from any net new prospects after mid-September.

## Page 8

Agencies start to be heads down and focused entirely on AEP / OEP and Q4 renewals. We will be focusing efforts on current prospects in the next 4 weeks, while starting to warm the pipeline for Q1 2026 as agencies come up for air.

### Key Needs or Asks

*   Continued support in identifying engineering talent (preference for PLTR and Ramp backgrounds), and those who have done M&A at scaled brokerages and / or lower middle market PE (e.g. Shore, Alpine)
*   We will likely be tapping some of you for closing and deal acceleration support, and we'll be in touch with you directly with more guidance here as deal discussions progress
*   Any referral channels that could be beneficial or supportive for deal sourcing (e.g. banks, business brokers, influencers in the space, etc.)

### Key Deliverables and August Grading

Additionally, we have a handful of engineers in the prospect pipeline who would be valuable additions to the team. We'll also be adding contractors (a UX/UI designer and software engineer) from Alleycorp Nord to support non-core AI product build out like the broker dashboard and appointment scheduling.                                    |

Our referral channel is in its infancy of it's development, and the development of this channel will be a key focus for the next 4 weeks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

# Gyde | Investor Monthly Overview

## July 2025

### Summary

The Gyde team just wrapped up our second week of collective full-time employment, which we largely spent onsite with key design partners across FL and TX. These partners have agreed to partner with us to be Beta testers of the product and be intimately involved in feature development and iterations based on their feedback. Coming out of the discussions, we've narrowed our initial product focus for Q4 to Renewal Automation, with Customer Service being a secondary need for the partners. This aligns well with our updated thesis that driving revenue growth will be the vast majority of our focus (vs reducing headcount). Each partner represents a different profile and allows us to have a representative client for the target segments and markets we will pursue. For reference, these partners are: CareTeam, RF Masters Insurance, Davidson Camp, AHIA, and The Enrollment Store.

We will welcome two new team members this coming week, George and Brian, who will help to accelerate our product development and top-of-the-funnel M&A efforts, respectively. Dan, our top prospect for Head of M&A, will conduct final round interviews with our leadership team next week before moving towards an offer. The addition of Dan will give us a solid foundation for our M&A machine, and he will partner closely with Will on strategy and Sam on post-acquisition Value Creation plans.

Critical deliverables for the next four weeks include driving technical design decisions, building backend infrastructure for the AI application(s) and moving 10+ targets into active deal discussions.

### Key Needs or Asks

*   Intros to advisors and influencers in the brokerage space who could accelerate our M&A efforts, ideally one scaled brokerage leader or a highly visible executive from a health plan (e.g. Bruce Broussard)
*   Potential CTO candidate intros and / or candidates you'd recommend we reach out to directly
*   Perspective on trade offs of going after one larger target of $10M vs two smaller targets at $4-$5M

Note that in future iterations of this report we will include snapshots of product roadmap, M&A pipeline, and hiring pipeline for key roles for reference.

These folks know the space intimately (each have done 100+ deals) and would accelerate us over the next 18 months.<br>• Top of the Funnel Development: We have hired Brian Keene to lead our top-of-the-funnel efforts. He brings a combination of rolodex and hustle that will drive velocity here. We will likely supplement his efforts with an SDR profile to further accelerate our progress, which we think we will have in seat by early August. |
