	- Eva Borden (behavioral health business lead)
	- Business leadership, clinical team, and product development team involved
- Success metrics defined:
	- Processing success rate
	- Average processing time
	- Progress/regression tracking
	- Missing data identification
	- Goal alignment analysis
	- Early provider performance indicators

### Product Development Progress

- System analyzes deficiencies and treatment goals to verify alignment
- Built data entry system as backup for unrecognizable file formats
- Successfully recruited Wes Doyle (AI modeling expert) as full-time developer
- Now have two full-time developers on backend platform

### Implementation Strategy

- No technological changes required from providers or health plans
- Clinical validation process:
	- Three clinical resources ready to review assessment findings
	- Will compare AI model findings vs. manual clinical write-ups
- Patient assessment frequency: 2 files per patient every six months
- Manual workaround developed for taste test:
	- Data entry system for unrecognizable formats
	- Clinical leadership reviewing findings

### Additional Business Development

- Discussions ongoing with Reliant Medical Group (Optum)
	- Contact promoted to oversee Atrius division
	- Different challenge: no existing autism processes
	- Clinical meeting held two weeks ago
- Q2 Focus: 99% focus on Evernorth taste test

Next Steps:
