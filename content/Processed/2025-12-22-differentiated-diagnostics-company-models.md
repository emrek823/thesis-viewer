# Differentiated Diagnostics: Creative Company Models for High Margins

## Executive Summary

**The Question:** What does "Tempus for autoimmune" or "Function Health with novel biomarkers" look like? How do you build a differentiated, high-margin diagnostics company?

**Core Insight:** The margin hierarchy in diagnostics is clear:
1. **Data licensing to pharma** (70%+ gross margin) >
2. **Specialized LDT testing** (60%+ gross margin) >
3. **Routine lab testing** (43% industry average) >
4. **DTC wellness panels** (lower than B2B clinical)

The winning formula combines: (1) proprietary assays that justify premium pricing, (2) recurring patient relationships (monitoring, not one-shot), (3) pharma data partnerships as second revenue stream.

**Hypothesis Outcomes:**

| ID | Hypothesis | Prior | Posterior | Status |
|----|------------|-------|-----------|--------|
| H1 | Tempus model replicable in autoimmune | 0.60 | 0.75 | **CONFIRMED** — Rheumatology underserved, biologic therapy selection is $100B+ market |
| H2 | Distribution > novel biomarkers for moat | 0.70 | 0.80 | **CONFIRMED** — Exagen, Scipher show novel assays need specialty channel |
| H3 | DTC wellness has worse margins than B2B | 0.55 | 0.50 | **INCONCLUSIVE** — Function Health's asset-light model may compensate |
| H4 | Proteomics enables differentiated panels | 0.65 | 0.70 | **PARTIALLY CONFIRMED** — 11,000+ proteins measurable, but clinical utility still proving out |
| H5 | Autoimmune underserved by diagnostics | 0.75 | 0.85 | **CONFIRMED** — No Tempus-equivalent, "Russian roulette of medications" current standard |

## 1. Business Model Archetypes

### Model A: Tempus (Clinical + Data Platform)

| Metric | 2024 | Q2 2025 | Source |
|--------|------|---------|--------|
| Total Revenue | $693M | $314M/quarter | [Tempus Q2 2025](https://www.tempus.com/news/tempus-reports-second-quarter-2025-results/) |
| Gross Margin | 45.5% | 62.0% | Q2 earnings |
| Data/Services Margin | — | 72.7% | Q2 earnings |
| Oncology Test Volume | — | 84K NGS tests | Q2 earnings |
| Data Contract Value | — | $1B+ TCV | AstraZeneca, Pathos deals |

**How It Works:**
1. **Genomics testing** (base layer): CAP/CLIA-certified lab runs NGS for oncologists
2. **Data licensing** (high-margin layer): De-identified datasets sold to pharma for $200M+ multi-year deals
3. **Apps/AI** (platform lock-in): TIME, Next products create physician workflow stickiness
4. **Acquisitions** (scale): Ambry Genetics ($600M), Deep 6 AI expand coverage

**Why Margins Improved:** Data licensing at 72.7% margin now 23% of revenue; genomics improving with volume leverage.

### Model B: Function Health (DTC Wellness Subscription)

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Annual Subscription | $499 (or $365 intro) | [Function Pricing](https://www.functionhealth.com/pricing) |
| Revenue Run Rate | $100M (Feb 2025) | [Sacra](https://sacra.com/research/function-health-at-100m-year/) |
| Subscribers | ~200,000 | Sacra estimate |
| YoY Growth | 450% | Sacra |
| Valuation | $2.5B (Nov 2025) | [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/19/function-health-closes-298m-series-b-at-a-2-5b-valuation-launches-medical-intelligence/) |
| Tests Included | 160+ biomarkers | Function website |

**How It Works:**
1. **Asset-light model**: Partner with Quest Diagnostics (2,000+ locations), no owned labs
2. **Subscription stickiness**: Two comprehensive panels per year, 3-6 month tracking
3. **Upsell expansion**: Add-on specialty tests ($39 avg), Galleri multi-cancer ($499 after Ezra acquisition)
4. **B2B partnerships**: Equinox "Optimize" tier ($40K) for high-end wellness market

**Unit Economics (Estimated):**
- $499/year subscription
- Quest reimbursement for 160 tests at $3-5/test = ~$500-800 cost
- Gross margin potentially negative or break-even on core panel
- Margin comes from: add-on tests, low marginal cost of tech platform, future marketplace

### Model C: Natera (MRD/Recurring Oncology)

| Metric | Q3 2025 | Source |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Oncology Tests | 211,000 | [Natera Q3 2025](https://www.natera.com/company/news/natera-reports-third-quarter-2025-financial-results/) |
| YoY Growth | 53.9% | Natera earnings |
| Total Revenue | $592M | Natera earnings |
| MRD Sequential Growth | 21,500 units | Record quarter |

**Why MRD is the Dream Model:**
- **Recurring by design**: MRD tests ordered every 3-6 months for years post-surgery
- **High clinical value**: Detecting recurrence before imaging creates urgency
- **Reimbursement tailwind**: Payers covering MRD as standard of care expands
- **Competitive moat**: Tumor-informed approach requires initial tissue sample = patient lock-in

## 2. Autoimmune: The Underserved Opportunity

### Market Scale

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Autoimmune Diagnostics Market | $5.7B (2024) | [Grand View Research](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/autoimmune-disease-diagnostics-industry) |
| 2030 Projection | $8.2B (6.2% CAGR) | Grand View Research |
| RA Prevalence (US) | 1.3M+ people | Market reports |
| Lupus Prevalence | 200K-300K in US | Literature |
| Biologic Spend | $100B+ globally | Industry estimates |

### Current State: "Russian Roulette of Medications"

> "Right now, in clinical practice, we go through a Russian roulette of medications. We start with one, we wait several months, and if it doesn't work we go to plan B." — Dr. Lanata, NIH researcher

**Why This Creates Opportunity:**
- **No validated predictive biomarkers** for treatment response in RA/lupus
- **Biologics cost $30K-100K/year** → huge payer incentive to get it right first time
- **TNF inhibitors fail 30-40%** of RA patients → precision selection matters
- **Synovial signatures** can predict TNF response but not yet in clinical practice

### Existing Players in Autoimmune Diagnostics

| Company | Focus | Status |
|---------|-------|--------|
| **Exagen (AVISE)** | Lupus diagnosis, RA, Sjögren's | Public, niche, ~$100M revenue |
| **Scipher Medicine** | PrismRA - biologic selection in RA | Private, $232M raised, pharma partnerships |
| **Anokion** | Immune tolerance (therapeutic, not diagnostic) | Private, novel approach |

**Gap:** No company has built the Tempus model (testing + data + AI platform) in autoimmune.

## 3. Novel Biomarkers: Proteomics Platform Comparison

### Technology Landscape

| Platform | Proteins Measured | Precision (CV%) | Strengths |
|----------|------------------|-----------------|-----------|
| SomaLogic (SomaScan 11K) | 11,000 | 5.3% | Broadest coverage, best precision |
| Olink Explore 3072 | 3,072 | 11.4% | Clinical translation focus |
| Olink Explore 5K | 5,000 | 26.8% | Broader but less precise |
| Alamar Bio (NULISA) | 200+ inflammation | Attomolar sensitivity | 10-100x more sensitive |

**Key Insight:** SomaLogic has best precision but now owned by Illumina. Olink now part of Thermo Fisher. The platforms are consolidating into big diagnostics players—opportunity is in **vertical application**, not platform building.

### Clinical Application Potential

**Autoimmune-Relevant Proteomics Opportunities:**
1. **14-3-3η protein** in RA improves prognostic precision for biologic selection
2. **Urine-based lupus nephritis biomarkers** for non-invasive monitoring
3. **Type I interferon signatures** predict anifrolumab response in SLE
4. **Synovial B cell/myeloid signatures** predict TNF vs tocilizumab response

## 4. Creative Company Models

### Model 1: "Tempus for Autoimmune"

**Concept:** Precision rheumatology platform combining genomic/proteomic testing with pharma data licensing.

**Mechanics:**
1. **Wedge:** PrismRA-style biologic selection test for RA as first product
2. **Expand:** Add lupus (AVISE competitor), Sjögren's, IBD
3. **Data Layer:** Build largest autoimmune multiomics database; license to pharma
4. **Platform:** AI-driven treatment selection recommendations

**Why Now:**
- Biologics market is $100B+ with 30-40% first-line failure rate
- Payers desperate for precision selection to avoid trial-and-error waste
- Pharma needs RWD on drug response for label expansion and competitive positioning
- No incumbent owns the full stack (Exagen = diagnosis only, Scipher = single product)

**Financial Model:**

| Revenue Stream | Margin | TAM Potential |
|----------------|--------|---------------|
| Biologic selection testing | 55-65% | $1B+ (if captures RA alone) |
| Monitoring/recurrence testing | 60%+ | $500M+ (recurring) |
| Pharma data licensing | 70%+ | $100-500M (AZ deal = $200M over 3 years) |

**Risk:** Scipher has 3-year head start; Exagen entrenched in diagnosis; specialty channel is slow.

### Model 2: "Function Health with Novel Biomarkers"

**Concept:** Premium DTC wellness with differentiated proteomics panels not available elsewhere.

**Mechanics:**
1. **Differentiation:** Offer Alamar NULISA inflammation panel (attomolar sensitivity) or Olink panels
2. **Positioning:** "The biomarkers your doctor can't order" — inflammation, longevity, neurodegeneration
3. **Subscription:** Annual testing with quarterly add-ons
4. **Data Play:** Build wellness proteomics database for longevity pharma R&D

**Why It's Hard:**
- Novel biomarkers lack clinical guidelines → "so what" problem for consumers
- High-plex proteomics costs $200-500/sample → margin pressure
- Regulatory risk if claims too clinical
- Function Health has distribution; differentiation via tests may not matter

**Better Variant:** Partner with Function Health or Superpower as their proteomics supplier, not competitor.

### Model 3: "Autoimmune MRD" (Monitoring Model)

**Concept:** Apply Natera's MRD playbook to autoimmune disease—serial monitoring for flare prediction.

**Mechanics:**
1. **Test:** Serial proteomic/autoantibody monitoring every 3-6 months
2. **Clinical Utility:** Predict lupus nephritis flares, RA progression, medication response
3. **Billing:** Create CPT code pathway for "autoimmune disease monitoring"
4. **Moat:** Longitudinal data on individual patients = proprietary prediction model

**Why This Could Work:**
- Autoimmune diseases are chronic, lifelong—recurring revenue built in
- Current monitoring is symptom-based; biomarker-based monitoring is clinically valuable
- Urine biomarkers for lupus nephritis gaining traction (non-invasive = higher compliance)
- Natera proved MRD model works; can adapt for chronic disease

**Financial Model:**

| Year | Tests/Year | ASP | Revenue |
|------|-----------|-----|---------|
| Year 3 | 50,000 | $500 | $25M |
| Year 5 | 200,000 | $600 | $120M |
| Year 7+ | 500,000+ | $700 | $350M+ |

**Risk:** No reimbursement pathway yet; clinical utility must be proven in trials.

### Model 4: "Specialty Pharma Data Factory"

**Concept:** Skip consumer-facing entirely. Build the Tempus data licensing business without the testing lab.

**Mechanics:**
1. **Acquire data rights** from existing labs, health systems, specialty clinics
2. **Structure data** for pharma use (treatment response, outcomes, biomarkers)
3. **License exclusively** to pharma for drug development and competitive intelligence
4. **Asset-light:** No lab CapEx, no reimbursement risk

**Precedent:** Tempus data/services at 72.7% gross margin. Caris Life Sciences pharma deals at $1.4B potential value.

**Why Autoimmune:**
- Biologics market starving for real-world treatment response data
- Limited existing data sources (no autoimmune equivalent of Flatiron for oncology)
- Specialty rheumatology practices are consolidable

## 5. Margin Analysis: What Actually Drives Profitability?

### Gross Margin Comparison

| Company/Model | Gross Margin | Key Driver |
|---------------|-------------|------------|
| Tempus Data/Services | 72.7% | Software + data licensing |
| Tempus Overall | 62.0% | Mix shift toward data |
| Guardant Health | 62% | Specialized LDT |
| Natera | ~60% est | LDT + volume scale |
| Quest Diagnostics | 40-43% | Commodity routine testing |
| Function Health | Unknown (likely low) | Asset-light but thin spreads |
| Superpower | Unknown (likely negative) | $199/year unsustainable pricing |

### Margin Drivers Ranked

1. **Pharma data licensing** — Highest margin, lowest volume dependency
2. **Specialized LDT (proprietary assay)** — 60%+ if own lab, differentiated test
3. **Monitoring/recurring tests** — Same margin as LDT + volume growth built-in
4. **Routine clinical testing** — 40-45%, commoditized
5. **DTC wellness** — Depends on model; asset-light helps but thin spreads

## 6. Red Team: Limitations & Counter-Evidence

### Challenge 1: "Tempus for Autoimmune" Already Exists

**Counter-argument:** Exagen and Scipher are doing this.

**Assessment:** PARTIALLY TRUE. Exagen is diagnosis-focused (AVISE CTD), not treatment selection or data platform. Scipher is single-product (PrismRA) without broad platform ambition. Neither has Tempus-style pharma data deals. Gap still exists.

### Challenge 2: Novel Biomarkers Don't Matter to Consumers

**Counter-argument:** Consumers can't interpret proteomics results; clinical utility undefined.

**Assessment:** TRUE for DTC. Novel biomarkers work for B2B clinical (pharma selection) but struggle in consumer wellness. "So what" problem is real.

### Challenge 3: Autoimmune Monitoring Has No Reimbursement

**Counter-argument:** Unlike MRD in oncology (covered), autoimmune monitoring isn't standard of care.

**Assessment:** TRUE today. Would require clinical trials proving flare prediction utility. Multi-year pathway.

### Challenge 4: Pharma Already Has Data Partnerships

**Counter-argument:** Tempus, TriNetX, Flatiron already supply pharma with RWD.

**Assessment:** TRUE in oncology. FALSE in autoimmune—no equivalent exists. This is the gap.

---

## 7. Investment Implications

### Bull Case for Autoimmune Diagnostics

1. **Massive biologic waste:** 30-40% first-line failure at $30K-100K/year per patient
2. **No incumbent:** Exagen is diagnosis, Scipher is single-product, no Tempus equivalent
3. **Pharma hunger:** $100B+ biologic market needs RWD on treatment response
4. **Clinical validation emerging:** Synovial signatures, urine biomarkers gaining traction
5. **Proteomics maturity:** 11,000+ proteins measurable enables novel panels

### Bear Case

1. **Specialty channel is slow:** Rheumatologists harder to reach than oncologists
2. **Scipher has head start:** 3+ years in market, Kythera Labs partnership
3. **Reimbursement uncertainty:** Monitoring not covered, selection tests still fighting
4. **Platform sprawl:** Easier to be single-product than full Tempus stack

### What Would Change Our Mind

| Signal | Interpretation |
|--------|----------------|
| Scipher hits $100M ARR | Proves market; but also proves competition |
| Major pharma acquires Exagen | Validates space |
| CMS covers RA precision selection | Reimbursement unlocked |
| Tempus enters autoimmune | Both validates and threatens |

## 8. Recommended Approach

**If Building a New Diagnostics Company:**

### Highest Conviction: "Autoimmune Precision Platform"

1. **Start with treatment selection** (like Scipher but broader)
2. **Expand to monitoring** (like Natera MRD but for chronic autoimmune)
3. **Build pharma data licensing** (like Tempus but for autoimmune)
4. **Avoid DTC wellness** (margins are bad, differentiation is hard)

### Wedge Strategy

| Phase | Focus | Timeline |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Year 1-2 | Single indication (RA biologic selection) | Build clinical utility |
| Year 2-3 | Expand indications (Lupus, Sjögren's, IBD) | Leverage same infrastructure |
| Year 3-4 | Add monitoring panel | Create recurring revenue |
| Year 4+ | Launch pharma data licensing | 70%+ margin business |

### Capital Efficiency

- **Own lab vs partner:** Own lab for margin control; partner initially for speed
- **Clinical trials:** Must run utility studies for reimbursement—budget $10-20M
- **Specialty sales:** Rheumatology is concentrated; 500 high-volume practices = 80% of volume
