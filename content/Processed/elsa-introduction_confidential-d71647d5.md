END-TO-END PLATFORM TO HELP
MORE DOCTORS OFFER EGG FREEZING

CONFIDENTIAL | 2023

## Slide 2: Problem/Solution/Traction Summary
There are only **1,300 fertility specialists** in the US - not enough
to accommodate **millions of patients**.

We train OB/GYNs and PCPs to perform egg freezing and
enable **more doctors** to see **more patients** at a **lower cost**.

We secured **4 LOIs** in 2 months, primed for entry into **9 states**,
and ready to unlock **$900,000 ARR**.

## Slide 4: The Problem: Treatment is Expensive and Unavailable in Most Areas
THE PROBLEM: TREATMENT IS EXPENSIVE AND
UNAVAILABLE IN MOST AREAS
Why? Severe supply and demand mismatch in the fertility industry

01
Only ~1,300
fertility doctors
(REIs) in the US

02
One cycle of egg
freezing ~$15,000

03
Care deserts
outside of CA, NY,
IL and TX

## Slide 5: Our Solution: Expand the Pool of Providers with Non-REI Physicians
OUR SOLUTION: EXPAND THE POOL OF
PROVIDERS WITH NON-REI PHYSICIANS

We are "ready-to-use" for doctors we upskill

01
We source and onboard patients for our
doctors

02
We train local OB/GYNs and PCPs and create
new revenue streams for them

03
We provide on-going clinical support with our AI
guided ovarian stimulation system

04
We provide egg freezing specific lab and storage
support

**Unique AI guided ovarian stimulation system to tackle
the most complicated part of egg freezing**

## Slide 6: Our Advantages
OUR ADVANTAGES
Effortless, adaptable, no capital expenditure, collaborative

**01 QUICK TO LAUNCH**
Minimal lead time from training
to launch (we add just egg
freezing, unlike our competitors,
we do not convert OB/GYNs into
full-service REIs)

**02 ABILITY TO SCALE WITH ANY
PROVIDER**
AI to streamline fertility
medication management (see
appendix)

**03 ASSET-LIGHT**
Lab-free: we have a lab team, we
do not need a physical lab

**04 MINIMIZED PUSHBACK FROM REIS**
REIs partner with us to extend
their clinical outreach

## Slide 7: We Offer a Much Lower Price for Patients
WE OFFER A MUCH LOWER
PRICE FOR PATIENTS

**ELSA: $5,000**
*   Pay per procedure
*   No labs capex needed
*   Use existing infrastructure
*   Cost-saving pharmacy partner

**STATUS QUO: $15,000**
*   X Pay for full-time REIs
*   X Lab: $3-5M
*   X License: 6 months+
*   X More staff/equipment

## Slide 8: Our Business Model Leads to a High Margin Profile
OUR BUSINESS MODEL LEADS TO A HIGH
MARGIN PROFILE

75%
Elsa steady state contribution margin

**ONE TIME
IMPLEMENTATION
FEE**
OB/GYN partners pay a one-
time implementation fee

**REV SHARE**
OB/GYN partners pay us a
% revenue every time they
see a new patient

30%
Traditional IVF Clinic margin

## Slide 9: Our Traction: 2 Months, 4 LOIs, with OB/GYNs in 9 States
OUR TRACTION: 2 MONTHS, 4 LOIS, WITH
OB/GYNS IN 9 STATES

**(Image: Map of the US showing states with varying shades and plus signs)**
The map indicates several states:
*   WA
*   OR
*   ID
*   CA
*   MN
*   IA
*   IL
*   CO
*   DE
States with a "+" symbol (Elsa pilot OB/GYNs license to practice) are shown in WA, CA, CO, IA, IL, DE.
The density of shading suggests low-cost competitors are present in many of these states and others.

Note: Density map includes low-cost competitors:
Kindbody, CNY, Mate

+ Elsa pilot OB/GYNs license to practice

**4 LOI**
Signed with pilot OB/GYNs

**9 STATES**
Elsa can enter in non-metropolitan areas

## Slide 10: We Can Quickly Reach $100M ARR
WE CAN QUICKLY REACH $100M ARR
By capturing <1% of the overall OB/GYN market¹

**~$900,000 ARR**
With the current **4 pilot
OB/GYNs** already on our
platform

**~$20M ARR**
**100 non-REI physicians**

**~$100M ARR**
**450 non-REI physicians**

Note: Assuming each doctor sees 15 egg freezing patients per month at $5,000 per patient, all in ~25% fee to Elsa (15% procedure fee + 100% lab fee).
Calculations exclude one-time implementation fee

1) ACOG estimates there are ~60,000 OB/GYNs in the United States. We assume the 450 non-REIs at $100 M ARR are OB/GYNS

## Slide 11: Roadmap: How Do We Get There

## Slide 15: Upside: Building Moat with Unique Dataset
UPSIDE: BUILDING MOAT WITH
UNIQUE DATASET
Elsa uses data from REIs clinics to build AI guided ovarian stimulation system

**BACKGROUND**
The patient cycle typically lasts 10 days, with
medication administered from Day 1 to 9.

Medication management is central to infertility
treatment.

Market data focuses only on total dosage, which
makes it difficult to calculate rates of raise and
trends in protocol.

**ELSA**
**Automation with AI:**
Our system **automates** the medication management process,
taking the burden off any non-REI physician.

**Our Data Advantage:**
We have comprehensive data from day 1 **through** day 10, which
helps us build a **precision tool** that can ensure **excellent clinical
outcomes**

## Slide 17: Why It Matters
WHY IT MATTERS
Financial and physical barriers are getting in the way of patients seeking
preventative care

Jane Doe, age 30, lives in
Wyoming

Wyoming has no state
mandated fertility coverage
and no in-state REI

To receive treatment, Jane
will have to pay **out-of-
pocket** and travel **out-of-
state**

**STATUS QUO**
Jane cannot afford to pay ~$15,000 for one round of egg freezing cycle
at age 30.
She waits until age 40 – meanwhile, her fertility declines dramatically
with age. She now must pay $50,000 – 100,000 for multiple rounds of
full IVF treatment. She will also need to spend ~$10,000 on travels and
hotel in New York/California. Treatment might bankrupt her and her
family.

**ELSA**
At age 30, Jane pays $5,000 for one round of egg freezing cycle her
local OB/GYN in Wyoming.
She still waits until age 40 to start a family. She goes back to use the
younger, healthier eggs she froze at age 30 and successfully have a
child through one round of ART.
