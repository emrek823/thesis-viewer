### Fundraising Update

- Round progressing well after legal misunderstanding
	- Super priority provisions being removed
	- Virtue remains protected in structure
- Two outstanding commercial points resolved:
	- Block on carve-out for secondary sales under 5% (minimal impact)
	- Common board seat language clarified - Transformations wants 1 of 2 common seats available if CEO leaves
- Reference calls completed:
	- Colleen (former Groups CEO) scheduled for Monday
	- John (Amino, sold to Capital RX) provided candid feedback
		- Transformations supportive but not tech-focused investor
		- Need technical co-investor for balance (Sean Flowers likely choice)
		- Won’t push aggressive growth like General Catalyst would
- Current round structure: Transformations $1.5M, Watershed $1M, Sunflower $1.5M
- Timeline: Wire planned for Thursday (before Christmas vacations)
- Diligence process intensive but nearing completion

### Regulatory & Structure

- PCM ASO structure now fully established vs. previous round exposure
	- Physician owner in place
	- MSA contracts completed
	- Still credentialing with payers including Medicare/MassHealth
- Current licensed psychologist operates outside structure temporarily to maintain billing capability
- Corporate practice of medicine compliance confirmed by lobbyists and HHS contacts

### Key Hiring Plans

- Three major hires under consideration:

### Market Expansion Strategy

- Two LOIs signed: Minnesota and Missouri
- Minnesota acquisition: $350K total ($250K down, $100K deferred)
- Missouri acquisition: $425K total ($75K down, 6-year amortization at ~$60-70K annually)
- Market expansion decision pending:
	- Conservative: 2 centers initially to test market
	- Aggressive: 4-6 centers from launch for faster scale
	- Key risks: recruiting BCBAs, lease obligations in unproven markets
	- Missouri particularly attractive: cheap labor/real estate, high reimbursement rates
- 22-state survey planned to identify additional acquisition opportunities

### Next Steps

- Legal documents expected by Wednesday
- Virtue, Sunflower, and Watershed teams need document review before wire
- Timing tight due to holiday schedules
- 2026 budget and board materials preparation for Q1 meetings
