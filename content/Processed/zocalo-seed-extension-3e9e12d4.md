# Zócalo Health - Investor Deck

## Slide 1: Zócalo Health

## Slide 2: Introducing ZÓCALO Health

Introducing
ZÓCALO Health

Our vision is to transform the health and wellness of Latino communities through culturally aligned, tech-enabled, community-oriented primary care.

*   Technology-enabled, integrated platform to deliver efficient, culturally proficient health & social care
*   Initial focus on a new Enhanced Care Management (ECM) program from CA Medicaid, representing a $1B opportunity for Latino members alone
*   Raising $2M seed extension to execute on signed contracts ($4.8M in 2024 revenue) and lay foundation for expansion in CA and beyond

## Slide 3: Millions of Latinos Need Zócalo Health - Opportunity Summary

### US Latino population is large and growing

*   Latinos currently represent 18% of the U.S. population
*   Latinos will be 30% of the population by 2050 at ~100M
*   Population growing faster than any other group in the US

### Latinos are currently underserved by US Healthcare system

*   1 in 3 of Latinos report no access to healthcare
*   Up to 3 month waits for PCP appointments
*   <6% of physicians speak Spanish
*   Below average engagement with providers leads to poor outcomes and high costs

### Publicly funded healthcare rewards risk management

*   Latinos make up ~30% of Medicaid beneficiaries nationwide, with 59+% in California
*   Risk adjustment programs align with ZH care management capabilities
*   Reimbursement for CHWs & Enhanced Care Management

## Slide 4: Bridging the Gap: Healthcare Disparities in the Latino Community

### Challenges for Patients

*   **Access & Convenience:** Limited availability, extended wait times, and inconvenient locations.
*   **Navigational complexity:** A one-size-fits-all healthcare system that is hard to navigate and use.
*   **Cultural Misalignment:** Lack of culturally aligned health resources, providers, and educational materials.
*   **Language Barriers:** Inadequate services in the patient's native language and cultural context.

### Challenges for Health Plans

*   **Engagement & Differentiation:** Struggles to attract and engage Latino members due to a lack of tailored services and differentiation.
*   **Quality & Financial Outcomes:** Poor performance in key metrics like Stars, HEDIS scores and financial results.
*   **Culturally Competent Staff & Resources:** Difficulty in managing member costs and engagement due to absence of culturally competent staff and resources.
*   **Equitable Access in Key Areas:** Challenges in ensuring equitable access to health and social services, especially in areas with significant Latino populations.

## Slide 5: A Latino Focused Care Model

That fills critical care gaps in Latino communities

Our community-oriented care model is centered around the effective use of Community Health Workers (CHW) and begins with engagement & trust building. We then enable comprehensive care that is culturally aligned and is effective in driving positive member outcomes and financial results.

**Net Promoter Score: 94.7**

**A Latino Focused Care Model components:**
(Starting from the top right and moving clockwise)
*   Social Services
*   Urgent Care
*   Complex Care Mgmt.
*   Cultural Proficiency
*   Care Coordination
*   Primary Care
*   Behavioral Health
*   CHW (Community Health Worker)
*   PdS (Patient-centered data system/platform/provider)

**Overall flow:**
Engagement -> Integrated Care -> Member Outcomes

## Slide 6: Community-Oriented Primary Care for Latinos, by Latinos.

Our advanced primary care team is comprised of our community health partners, nurses, physicians, behavior health professionals as well as non-clinical coordinators to expand access and deliver an elevated member experience.

### Primary Care

We coordinate with members' existing primary care providers or match member with Zócalo Health providers based on their personal preferences and needs.
*   Clinician
*   CHW

### Behavioral Health

We provide therapy, support groups and family counseling.
*   Clinician
*   CHW
*   CBO (Community-Based Organization)

### Social Services

We help coordinate housing, employment, legal aid, food, childcare and other services members might need.
*   CHW
*   CBO

### Care Coordination

We work with members' doctors, specialists, and case managers to arrange home-based care, in-person appointments, and virtual support as needed.
*   Clinician
*   CHW

### Complex Care Management

Our care teams are experienced at working with members with complex needs that make it difficult to improve their health.
*   Clinician
*   CHW
*   CBO

### Urgent Care

Members can call us for any urgent needs. We're expanding hours to include 24/7 in 2024.
*   Clinician

## Slide 7: Our Care Model in Action

**Maria** is a 65-year-old Latina with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and a recent history of congestive heart failure. She lives alone in a community with limited access to healthcare services. Maria struggles with English, which makes navigating the healthcare system challenging for her.

### Without Zócalo Health

Maria has several emergency room visits due to poorly managed diabetes and hypertension. Her conditions have been exacerbated by her difficulty in following dietary recommendations and medication schedules, partly due to cultural preferences and language barriers.

*   4 ER visits a year at an average cost of $2,000 each: **$8,000**
*   1 hospitalization for congestive heart failure: **$15,000**
*   Monthly medications for diabetes and hypertension: **$3,600** ($300/month)
*   Potential additional costs for complications (e.g., kidney issues, additional hospital): **$5,000 - $20,000**

**Total Without Zócalo Health: $31,000 - $46,000**

### With Zócalo Health

*   Comprehensive Care Assessment
*   Personalized Care Plan
*   CHW Led Care Coordination
*   Social Support Integration
*   Ongoing Monitoring & Adjustment

**Total With Zócalo Health: $12,000 - $16,000**
(Savings of 65.2%)

## Slide 8: GTM Strategy provides value for members and health plans

### Members

**Pain Points**
*   Similar to other Latino communities, 91.8% of Merced County lives in a severe health professional shortage.
*   FQHCs have 3+ month waitlists and do not have any extended hours or offerings for care management.

**Engagement Strategy**
*   Meeting patients where they are - in-person outreach, virtual telephone, or in-app messaging
*   Working with local communities where these members already live, work, and play to drive outreach and engagement

### Health Plans

**Pain Points**
*   Unengaged Medicaid members are more expensive and can cost up to $46K per year
*   Plans are struggling to identify and enroll Latino members, let alone provide social services that exacerbate complex conditions

**Contracting Strategy**
*   Enhanced Care Management (ECM) in CA ($400 - $625 PMPM - yielding ~65% in savings annually per patient
*   In-network FFS reimbursement for primary care
*   Leverage ECM and FFS to prove outcomes beyond CA for similar care management opportunities and shared savings

## Slide 13: Financials: $9.7M Annual Revenue Run-rate with 59% Gross Margins by EOY 2024

85% of patients in '24 are Medicaid VBC; Additional commercial expansion in '25

Annual Revenue Run-rate = $9.7M

59% and 66% gross margins driven by CHW-led model (1 CHW : 190 members)

S&M scales efficiently over time (10% of revenue in '25) as plans directly work with Zocalo and in some cases provide direct funding for member outreach and enrollment

Efficient growth and opportunity to "own our own destiny" after seed extension

## Slide 14: $2M Seed Extension: Key Milestones to Raise Series A

1.  **Execute on current contracts** - ECM ($625 PMPM with Alliance) and commercial contracts (Blue Shield of CA) - in CA to secure attractive reimbursement and demonstrate success (enrollment rates, clinical outcomes, cost-savings)
2.  **Demonstrate ability to scale capacity** with CHWs (increasing capacity from 50 to 150+ members) while maintaining strong outcomes and internal processes (hiring, training, etc)
3.  **Continue expansion outside of CA** by proving clinical outcomes in ECM and build pipeline to scale our complex care management approach to different lines of business and other payment models
