2.  Chain creation: retrieval and LLM config, question answering (Ask question → LLM → Answer with)
3.  DEPLOY LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (LLMs)

### Screenshot of Databricks Notebook:
*   **Biomedical Question Answering over Custom Datasets with LangChain and Open Source LLMs on Hugging Face**
*   **ASK QUESTIONS AND RECEIVE ANSWERS WITH GENERATIVE AI**
*   Example question: "what are the primary drugs for treating cystic fibrosis (CF)?"
*   Answer: "The primary drugs for treating cystic fibrosis (CF) include pancreatic enzymes, mucolytics and antibiotics, including low dose macrolides."

### Answer biomedical research questions with generative AI
Generative AI is taking the world by storm. In the healthcare industry, researchers, clinicians and medical professionals are turning to large language models (LLMs) to analyze and summarize large amounts of medical data, like biomedical literature.

What makes LLMs run effectively is high-quality data, and lots of it. When 30% of the world's data volume is generated by the healthcare industry, there's opportunity to operationalize and deliver new insights with the help of LLMs.

With the Databricks Lakehouse for Healthcare and Life Sciences, and this Solution Accelerator, organizations can:
*   Unify numerous medical data sources, including PubMed biomedical literature
*   Choose any open source, fine-tuned large language model to answer biomedical questions based on a collection of PDF documents
*   Summarize biomedical documents

## Slide 40: Big Data is super cool now...
Big Data is super cool now...
For those of us who are veterans of Big Data in HLS, it's exciting to watch the "heyday" of it unfold, in
part, because many of us were the "Data Nerds" relegated to working in back rooms.

| THEN                                                   | NOW                                                           |
| :----------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Data collection was artifact of another business that was pursued | Data collection is intentional and a primary business focus |
| Data was stored on large on prem servers with colo facilities | Data is stored in cloud environments                        |
| Data Governance was focused on procurement and user access | Data Governance is a comprehensive workflow & management of assets |
| Data-driven decisions were less popular                | Data-driven decisions are the way                             |
| A small collection of individuals know the ins and outs of the data | A small collection of individuals know the ins & outs of the data – but now there is a huge user base |

## Slide 44: Massive Demand with Little Understanding & Appreciation
Massive Demand with Little Understanding & Appreciation

### Huge demand for analytics & insight, but there's a big gap in the role of the data
*   Everyone, especially Leadership Teams, is talking about AI & Machine Learning and across every organization there's mounting pressures for its adoption and use
*   One of the consistent findings we continue to see out of Stanford HAI, MIT, & Leaders in AI & ML is how Data & Data Quality shapes AI & Machine Learning outcomes

### Stanford University - Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence
*   **Machine Learning: Data-Centric AI: AI Models Are Only as Good as Their Data Pipeline**
    To produce higher performing AI systems, researchers need to focus on the data.
*   "All that progress in algorithms means it's actually time to spend more time on the data..." - Dr. Andrew Ng, AI/ML Pioneer

## Slide 45: The Data Governance Process in HLS is a Hellacious Endeavor
The Data Governance Process in HLS is a Hellacious Endeavor

*   The HLS industry presents a lot of challenges for optimizing the data it collects
    *   HIPAA Compliance & Privacy
    *   Lack of standardizations & consistency
    *   Conflicting standards of data integrity for end user needs – "what does good even mean?"
*   Data Governance framework is dictated by HIPAA Compliance, and this impacts every aspect of our collection and operations
*   DH works with de-identified patient level data which is certified via Expert Determination
*   Expert Determination (“ED” or “Cert") assesses re-identification risk and the de-identified patient level data undergoes a comprehensive review process
    *   This review considers sources, fields, field content, personnel access, other datasets in the ecosystem
    *   The Expert Determination sets the rules DH must abide by including who can access, what fields need to be redacted, levels of fidelity permissible
    *   And those rules change every time we want to add an additional source of data, meaning, we have a moving target of rules of follow
*   In other words, someone else is telling us what we can & cannot do with our data...

## Slide 47: Databricks Helps Us Create Single Source of Truth
Databricks Helps Us Create Single Source of Truth

### Data Architecture
databricks

*   Lakehouse enables multi level data flows to unify assets
    *   Landing, Raw, Curated, and Data Marts that enable proper data curation for multiple assets
*   Preceding Stages are still easily accessible to enable Data Quality checks and comparisons post synthesis & transform
    *   If something is awry, we are instantly able to monitor and troubleshoot to isolate the cause
    *   This is critical, as for some of our major data assets, DH is **not the source of the data collection**
    *   DH is running 10+ tokenization link packages for de-identified patient data & aggregating millions of records from all different sources...a lot can go wrong
*   Assets are unified in a single location on Lakehouse and create one main database that powers everything else
    *   Still able to create Safe Locations to place assets that can't be combined and need to be siloed from others like consumer, customer assets, or new de-identified data source

## Slide 49: Data Models That Are Logical and Explainable
Data Models That Are Logical and Explainable

### Data Modeling
databricks

*   A unified source of truth from Lakehouse allows us to create data models and data marts from the unified asset with downstream broader access
*   This enables different stakeholders to create versions of the data that are optimized for their end use
    *   DH has a self-service platform, Custom Reporting, Advanced Analytics, and Data Science & AI Teams, and produces Data Extracts and API's all with similar yet different priorities
    *   There are data curation layers on the main data sets, but additional data models address and implement additional transformations that may be needed to optimize performance for products or require creation of derivative variables for AI/Machine Learning needs
*   Core Teams create downstream Data Models, Data Marts, and views and limit/remove major problems are that associated with altering data and variables at a warehouse level as it prioritizes accountability for differences via methods, not data
    *   DH needs to be accountable to for differences in the numbers we put forth to our Clients and that needs to be explained by methods not by disparate data sets

## Slide 50: Data Models That Make Everyone Happy and Scale Data SMEs
Data Models That Make Everyone Happy and Scale Data SMEs

### Data Modeling
databricks

*   Removes time spent on discussions of the definition of "Good"
    *   Data Science vs. Product vs. Custom Reporting don't have to face off
    *   Data Science, Custom Reporting, & Advanced Analytics have increased pressure on precision and accuracy for the perceived success of their work

### Definitive Healthcare - Atlas US Healthcare Reference & Affiliations Dataset
*   Free
*   Billions of contextual elements on US healthcare professionals and organizations.

*   DH scale's their limited Data Experts who know the assets inside and out
    *   The SME's work with company wide stakeholders or directly create the Data Models and Marts needed for wide scale use
    *   The minimizes errors due to lack of knowledge and maximizes output for the SME's
    *   Ad hoc builds that end up with wide scale value can easily be deployed and automated with DB
*   The extension of the expertise is carried through to our clients via Databricks Marketplace and Private Delta Share
    *   DH builds and can customize our data marts for end point ingestion presenting the data in the optimal way to ingest and use
    *   The has significantly reduced time needed from SMEs who are working directly with Clients that inadvertently create issues with their own ETL process or revisions to the data model that are illogical

## Slide 51: Compliance & Agility Coexists on Databricks
Compliance & Agility Coexists on Databricks

### Privacy & Compliance
databricks

*   Unity Catalog is one of the most critical and useful tools for our data governance process especially when it comes to Compliance and Privacy
    *   DH assets must comply with consumer, HIPAA, and GDPR Regulations
    *   Unity Catalog's 4-tiered object models allows for maximized flexibility to restrict users and access with various levels of our assets
    *   User Groups along with the object model hierarchy enable our approach so we can restrict individuals to assets that have been curated properly from the main source
*   Database (schema) levels enable user permissioning for peers regarding access for their work
    *   This is critically important as our teams can independently leverage and use Client proprietary data such as territory alignments and other information that is restricted to only the individuals working on the project
*   Additional views of data assets and masking functions are used to restrict sensitive data points that we need on the data for certain purposes but do not want everyone to have access to without duplicating large data
    *   Example: Internal source names at the transaction level is masked in other views as its disseminated to a larger user base to democratize access but not risk compliance issues

## Slide 52: DaaP is Only as Good as your Data Governance Process
DaaP is Only as Good as your Data Governance Process
Any organization that is looking to use their data internally or sell it externally needs to embrace data
governance processes and all that comes with it because:

*   Data is your foundation
    *   Integrate multiple assets into one data governance process to maximize value and utility
    *   Create processes that are repeatable, explainable, and leverage the data expertise
    *   AI/Machine and Analytics may have the hyper focus, but data hygiene is what enables quality output

### Garbage In, Garbage Out (GIGO Forever)
*   Image shows: GARBAGE DATA → GREAT MODEL → GARBAGE RESULTS
*   You WILL end up paying on the front end, so it's worth your time to build a process to address it on the back end

*   Databricks has a significant impact of data governance streamlining and efficiency
    *   This is where Databricks is superior in utility and function as it creates the ideal balance of process and security without compromising accessibility and optimizing data democratization for an organization

## Slide 67: Internal Model Development Environment
Internal Model Development Environment
MODEL DEVELOPMENT AND SERVING VIA DATABRICKS

Development of internal, fine-tuned LLM's supported via

### Example Penn Efforts
*   Image analytics (e.g., Radiology, Cardiology)
*   Patient message responses (e.g. Inbasket management) and patient history (e.g. summarization)
*   Open source (e.g., Dolly, MPT, Llama2) and proprietary (e.g., GPT) model availability for research, fine-tuning, validation, and deployment

### Data Needs
*   Structured clinical data (EMR)
*   Unstructured notes and voice data
*   Clinical documents, e.g., labs, results
*   Imaging data (e.g., radiology, pathology, cardiology)

### Databricks Notebook Code Snippet:
```python
1 import pandas as pd
2 import mlflow
3 import json
4
5 mlflow.set_registry_uri("databricks-uc")
6
7 from datetime import date, datetime, timezone
8 from dateutil.relativedelta import relativedelta
9 import pytz
10
11
12 est = pytz.timezone ('US/Eastern') #Set timezone, Databricks default is UTC
13 def session():
14 d = json.loads(dbutils.notebook.entry_point.getDbutils().notebook().getContext().toJson())
15 return {
16 'timestamp': datetime.today().astimezone (est).replace(tzinfo=None),
17 'user':d['tags']['user'],
18 'notebookId': d['tags'] ['notebookId'],
19 'notebook_path': d['extraContext') ('notebook_path'],
20 'model':llm_model
21 }
22
23 def saver (log, tablename):
24 save_sp = spark.createDataFrame (pd.DataFrame ([log]))
25 save_sp.write.mode("append").option("mergeSchema", "true").saveAsTable (tablename)
26
1 # llm_model = "LLM-dolly-v2-3b"
2 # llm_model = "LLM-dolly-v2-7b"
3 # llm_model = "LLM-dolly-v2-12b"
4 llm_model = "LLM-mpt-7b-instruct"
5 # llm_model = "llm-mpt-30b-instruct"
6
7 loaded_model = mlflow.pyfunc.load_model(f"models:/prepared.common.{llm_model}/1")
```
