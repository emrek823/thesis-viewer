Investor Presentation

## Slide 2: Accomplish HEALTH EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Best-in-Class Obesity Care & Clinical Outcomes
*   Our care model includes regular clinician visits, pharmacotherapy, regular dietician visits, nutrition plans and connected scales.
*   Our clinical outcomes are weight loss of 22% of total body weight after 1 year, which compares to peers achieving 5-16% weight loss.
*   We directly employ all of our clinicians and dieticians, rather than via staffing agencies, leading to more expert, more on-brand care provision.

### Strong Recent Traction with Rapid Revenue Growth
*   Revenues have grown ~8x to a ~$1.8m run-rate from August 2023 to May 2024, and we expect a ~$3m run-rate by the end of 2024.
*   Over the same period, our Active Patient count grew ~5x to ~1,000 in May 2024, and Appointments were up ~5x to ~800 monthly appointments.
*   This was driven by organic D2P growth, wider insurance coverage (up from 2 payers to the Big 5 + Medicare), and our first health system partnerships.

### Seasoned Team with Vast Healthcare & Startup Experience
*   A seasoned healthcare CEO Andrew Olanow, who co-founded and scaled Sollis Health, became the Accomplish CEO in 2H 2023.
*   Our CMO Dr. Mike Albert is a leading obesity expert, having built the program at Cedars and with a large social following (~300k on TikTok).
*   Our COO Tina Robilotto scaled and/or oversaw clinical operations at Columbia, John Hopkins, Planned Parenthood and Phosphorous.

### Affordable and Sustainable, In-Network Weight-Loss
*   We are in-network with all major insurers across our markets, helping to limit out-of-pocket expenses for patients, leading to lower churn.
*   GLP1 drugs are often not in-network and costly for patients, so we advocate for coverage (2/3 of our patients) or steer them to alternate covered medications (remaining 1/3) to reduce patient expense.

### Unique Partnership Model with Health Systems
*   Health systems are under resourced in the clinical obesity care needed for obese patients ahead of surgery, which has led to a material loss of procedure volumes in bariatrics, fertility and orthopedics.
*   Accomplish serves as a virtual affiliate practice for these hospitals, shortening patient wait times, reducing health system expenses & driving system revenue.
*   We also work with health systems to build cardiometabolic programs for obesity and other chronic conditions to help patients across all departments.

### Fundraising to Fuel Our Growth in Chronic Care Management
*   We are raising funds to accelerate bus development, scale clinical/operational staff, and enhance product/technology... to fuel growth & efficient scalability.
*   We are also assessing acquisitions in virtual care and remote monitoring for chronic conditions to expand our abilities to support health systems.

## Slide 4: Obesity is a massive problem with a large associated cost burden; 42% of US adults live with obesity, with ~50% expected by 2030.

### Half of American Adults (~140M) Will Suffer from Obesity by 2030.
**U.S. Obesity rates, 1990-2030 Legend:**
*   <20%
*   20-29%
*   30-39%
*   40-49%
*   50-59%

*   42% of American adults (~108M) suffer from obesity in 2020, which is expected to grow to 50% in 2030.
*   Obesity-related conditions include heart disease, stroke, diabetes and certain cancers. These are among the leading causes of preventable, premature death.

### Obese Patients are >2x More Costly for Insurance Plans.

**Chart: Obese Patient Costs for Insurance Plans ($)**
| Year | Enrollees without an obesity diagnosis (Avg. Cost) | Enrollees with an obesity diagnosis (Avg. Cost) |
|------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| 2011 | $3,000                                           | $6,500                                          |
| 2013 | $3,500                                           | $7,500                                          |
| 2015 | $4,000                                           | $9,000                                          |
| 2017 | $4,000                                           | $10,000                                         |
| 2019 | $4,500                                           | $11,000                                         |
| 2021 | $4,500                                           | $12,500                                         |

*   Medical costs to insurance plans for adults with obesity are significantly higher than those with healthy weight.
*   The medical cost of obesity in the US was estimated to be ~$147-260B in 2019.

## Slide 5: Reduction in BMIs for patients with obesity unlocks major health benefits and enable an increase in critical “elective” procedures.

### Reductions in Patient BMI correlate to significant health benefits.
*   ↓ Blood Pressure levels
*   ↓ Cancer
*   ↓ Cardiac Disease
*   ↓ Cholesterol levels
*   ↓ Diabetes Type II
*   ↓ Physical Function Issues
*   ↓ Liver Disease
*   ↓ Mental Illness
*   ↓ Osteoarthritis
*   ↓ Pain
*   ↓ Premature Mortality
*   ↓ Sleep Apneas

### Patients can access recommended procedures and treatments.
*   Bariatric Procedures (70% of patients eligible for bariatric surgery are lost to follow-up)
*   Orthopedic Surgeries (80% of patients with high BMIs do not convert to surgery)
*   Elective Surgeries
*   Fertility Treatments
*   Enhanced Cardiological Care
*   Enhanced Primary Care

These are highly revenue-generative & profitable areas for hospitals.

## Slide 6: Due to limited available resources, only <3% of patients who suffer from obesity access the guideline-recommended care they need.

### Only ~3% of patients with obesity receive the guideline-recommended treatments.

**Chart: Access to Guideline-Recommended Obesity Treatments (%)**
| Treatment Type                | Percentage of Obese Patients |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Obese Patients Eligible for Care | 100%                         |
| IBT (Intensive Behavioral Therapy) | ~2%                          |
| Obesity Medications           | ~3%                          |
| Bariatric Surgery             | ~1%                          |

**Patient Opportunity** (highlighted over IBT, Obesity Medications, and Bariatric Surgery)

**Source:** "The Struggle Is Real - What To Do When You Feel Like You've Done It All." Scott Kahan. YWM2021.

*   The American Board of Obesity Medicine indicates that there are only ~8,000 obesity-specialized physicians in the US.
*   This implies a patient-to-physician ratio of ~15,000:1, which is unserviceable, leading to wait times of 6-18 months.
*   As a result, the vast majority of US individuals with obesity (~95%) have not received recommended care.
*   Even with many new efficacious obesity drugs on the market, access is still limited with relatively low penetration.

## Slide 7: There is a large $180B TAM for obesity-related cardiometabolic services in the US, which is set to grow rapidly over the coming years.

### TAM is large and will grow inline with obese population

**Chart: TAM Growth for Obesity-Related Cardiometabolic Services**
| Year | Metric             | Value     |
|------|--------------------|-----------|
| 2022A| Spend              | ~$15B     |
| 2022 | TAM                | ~$180B    |
| 2030 | TAM                | ~$410B    |

*   In 2022A, the actual obesity-related medical services spend was ~$15B.
*   In 2022, our estimated TAM of ~$180B is based on ~120m Americans suffering from obesity, with ~$1,500 per patient of annual spend on obesity-related medical services.
*   In 2030, our estimated TAM of ~$410B is based on ~165m Americans suffering from obesity, with ~$2,500 per patient of annual spend on obesity-related medical services.

## Slide 8: Our broader vision is to increase TAM by using our Virtual Care and Monitoring platform across additional chronic diseases.

### Prevalence of Chronic Diseases
*   1 chronic disease: 60% of US adults
*   >1 chronic diseases: 42% of US adults
*   >4 chronic diseases: 12% of US adults

### Chronic Disease Patient Counts
*   Heart Disease: ~133m Americans
*   Hypertension: ~133m Americans
*   Obesity (launched): ~120m Americans
*   Diabetes: ~38m Americans
*   Kidney Disease: ~37m Americans
*   Cancer: ~17m Americans
*   COPD: ~16m Americans

### Acquisition
*   To accelerate growth, we have seen the opportunity to acquire virtual care and remote monitoring companies under duress at low prices.

| INDUSTRY                              | ARR     | STATUS           |
|---------------------------------------|---------|------------------|
| Target 1: Virtual Obesity Care        | $300k   | Partially Acquired |
| Target 2: Remote Monitoring of Diabetes Patients | $6m     | Under Review     |
| Target 3: Medication Monitoring       | $1m     | Initial Diligence |

*   We are actively pursuing additional targets.

## Slide 9: Accomplish uses telemedicine to provide evidence-based obesity care, managed by obesity-specialized physicians and dieticians.

### Our Obesity-Specialized, Physician-Led Care Model

**Monthly Visits**
Our physicians and NPs visit with patients on a monthly basis, in order to create, monitor and adjust care plans to deliver our best-in-class clinical outcomes.

**Rx Medications**
We use FDA-approved medications to treat the underlying, biological causes of weight gain, under the supervision of an obesity-specialized clinical team.

**Nutrition Therapy**
Our dieticians see patients regularly to develop and enhance healthy nutrition plans. There is no one-size-fits-all diet, so we design our plans to be flexible.

**Connected Devices**
We remotely monitor key patient metrics through connected scales, blood pressure cuffs and other devices, in order to drive optimal clinical results.

Telemedicine Increases Visit Accessibility by ~40%

## Slide 10: Unlike most competitors, we accept most insurances and steer patients to covered drugs to minimize patient out-of-pocket expense.

| **Meaningful Advances in Medications** | GLP1s have raised the profile of obesity as a disease and driven patients to seek care more pervasively.                 | Drug cost & availability requires providers to be smart & nimble, so our model focuses on treating 1/3 of patients without GLP1s, accessing GLP1s when needed, & reducing overall GLP1 costs.                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Obesity Care Delivery Models** | Obesity care providers initially used direct-to-patient membership models with monthly out-of-pocket fees and GLP1 cash pay, in order to attract patients & grow. | As the market becomes more saturated, patients seek care delivery models that are covered by insurance and limit drug costs, in order to maintain low churn levels, which is why we are fully in-network.                                                                                                                                          |
| **How to Best Manage Chronic Conditions** | Traditional online pharmacies have had success selling GLP1s or less effective compounded alternatives, but with no specialized clinicians or care for the patient. | Patients seek dedicated obesity-specialized clinicians to manage their care longitudinally over time and steer them towards the best courses of treatment, which is why we FT employ obesity-expert MDs, NPs and RDs.                                                                                                                                    |
| **Obesity Care Service Models** | Obesity care players have been primarily focused on D2C acquisition and partnering with payers or employers, in order to gain market share, but these channels have shown limited stickiness and high churn. | We partner with health systems to drive their revenue and profits, but also to become intrinsic to the core care infrastructure that patients are us to; this enables us to acquire many patients in one go & at a low CAC.                                                                                                                              |

## Slide 16: After proving efficacy with D2C patients, we have turned our focus to B2B partnerships with health systems to scale more rapidly.

### The Health System's Dilemma in Caring for Patients with Obesity

**1) Pre-Op Requirements**
Health systems (and payers) have protocols for obese patients before bariatric and other elective procedures

**2) Long Wait Times**
In-house medical teams that care for patients with obesity are understaffed, with wait times of 6-18 months.

**3) Leaked Patients**
Patients eligible for surgery are lost, as they seek care elsewhere during the wait or abandon treatment altogether.

**4) Lost Revenues**
Leaked patients equates to less procedures, reduced revenues and lower profits across the health system.

## Slide 17: Accomplish uses a flexible partnership model with health systems to care for their patients with obesity in ways that benefit all parties.

### Accomplish-Health System Referral Partnership
1.  **Referral:** Health system partner sends referrals to Accomplish.
2.  **Clinical Services:** Accomplish provides clinical services to shared patients.
3.  **Higher Conversion:** Shorter patient wait times drive less leakage & more surgeries.
4.  **Staff Savings:** Health system saves on staffing and increases staff flexibility.
5.  **Fee Sharing:** If health system delegates payor contracts, there is fee sharing.

### How Each Party Benefits

**ACCOMPLISH BENEFITS**
*   Access to Patients (Each hospital partner unlocks thousands of potential patients)
*   Better Payor Contracts (2-3x our rates)
*   Trusted Local Brand (To drive penetration)

**HEALTH SYSTEM BENEFITS**
*   Reduced Staff Costs (We pay for MDs and dieticians)
*   Reduced Leakage (Retain patients for future referrals)
*   Increased Procedures (~5-10% increase in surgery conversion)
*   Revenue Share on Services (when delegating credentialing)

**PATIENT BENEFITS**
*   Reduced Wait Times (<4 weeks vs 6-18 months)
*   Best-in-Class Obesity Care (Industry-leading weight loss results)
*   Telemedicine Convenience (Access our care from anywhere)
*   In-Network Care (Accept most major insurances)

## Slide 18: In Obesity Care alone, we see a clear path to >$100m of Revenues % >30% EBITDA margins in the next 5 years, with breakeven in 2025

### Chart: Revenues and EBITDA Projections

| Year | Revenues ($) | EBITDA ($)     |
|------|--------------|----------------|
| 2023 | ~$1,500,000  | ~$0            |
| 2024 | ~$5,000,000  | ~$0            |
| 2025 | ~$12,000,000 | ~$0            |

| 2028 | ~$115,000,000| ~$33,000,000   |

### Revenue
*   We assume ~20 health system partners by 2028.
    *   -> can be achieved with fewer large systems and more rapidly.
*   2028 active patient count is ~60,000, with ~100,000 patients since inception including churn.
    *   -> reflective of only 0.08% penetration of the overall TAM.

### EBITDA
*   Scale gross margins reach ~50%.
*   Scale EBITDA margins are >30%.

## Slide 19: Our revenue per patient and unit economics at scale are compelling, with best-in-class GM of ~50% and upside from hospital deals.
