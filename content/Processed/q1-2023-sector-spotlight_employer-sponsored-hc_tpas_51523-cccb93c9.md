## Slide 2: Large and Growing Addressable Market

### U.S. Health Insurance Market by Coverage Type

*   **Employer-Sponsored**
*   **Individual**
*   **Traditional Medicare**
*   **Medicare Advantage**
*   **Medicaid**

#### U.S. Health Insurance Market by Coverage Type (Pie Chart Data)
*   **Total Insured Population (1):** 310M+
    *   **Employer-Sponsored:** 51%
    *   **Individual:** 8%
    *   **Traditional Medicare:** 8%
    *   **Medicare Advantage:** 10%

*   Employer purchases health insurance from a carrier; carrier assumes financial risk of providing healthcare for employer's beneficiaries
    *   **×** Carrier keeps any surplus
    *   **×** Limited insight into cost drivers
    *   **×** Lack of dedicated support
    *   **×** Lack of customization
    *   **×** No rate, access, or repricing control
    *   **×** Misaligned incentives

#### Self-Funded Health Plan
*   **~105M Lives Covered (65%)**
*   Employer pays for claims incurred by beneficiaries and partners with TPA for claims administration, stop-loss, and value-add solutions, including data analytics and cost containment
    *   **✓** Employer keeps surplus
    *   **✓** Not tied to carrier's rates, fees, or restrictions
    *   **✓** Plans customized to employer's specific health benefit requirements and goals
    *   **✓** Complete visibility into each claim incurred and active management of costs
    *   **✓** Options to address cost drivers through incentives and educational resources

Employers are increasingly moving toward self-funded health plans in order to reduce costs and retain surplus; the TAM will continue to increase, benefiting innovative TPAs prepared to capitalize on new SMB lives entering the market

## Slide 3: Self-Funded Strategies Prevailing

### Estimated Workers Covered in Self-Funded Plans by Firm Size

*   Recent changes in the U.S. healthcare system have created a favorable environment for alternative healthcare insurance options
*   Employers are frustrated with the escalating insurance premiums associated with fully insured coverage
*   The widespread adoption of self-funded insurance strategies, **especially by SMBs**, has amplified the TAM
*   Large employer trends (**5,000+ employees**) have caught on by SMEs capable of carrying stop-loss insurance (**100+**)
*   Collectively, since 2001, the number of companies electing to self-insure has increased by 16 percentage points

#### Estimated Workers Covered in Self-Funded Plans by Firm Size (Bar Chart Data)

| Firm Size     | 2001 | 2011 | 2022 |
| :------------ | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 3-199         | 13%  | 17%  | 20%  |
| 200-999       | 50%  | 52%  | 59%  |
| 1,000-4,999   | 59%  | 66%  | 79%  |
| >5,000        | 91%  | 96%  | 82%  |
| All Firms     | 49%  | 60%  | 65%  |

As employers take more control over rising healthcare costs for their employees—increasingly implementing self-funded strategies—they will look to their TPAs for ROI-generating cost containment strategies to minimize risk

**Sources:** Kaiser Family Foundation - Employer Health Benefits Annual Surveys; Wall Street research.

## Slide 4: Tailwinds Accelerating Self-Funded Strategies

Unsustainable healthcare cost trends, rising insurance premiums, and the potential for cost savings are driving the adoption of self-funded health plans.

### Healthcare Cost Per Capita

Regulation and an aging and increasingly chronic population drive growth in healthcare spending ($ in 000s)

#### Healthcare Cost Per Capita (Line Chart Data)

| Year | Spending ($ in 000s) |
| :--- | :------------------- |
| 2008 | 7,910                |
| 2009 |                      |
| 2010 |                      |
| 2011 |                      |
| 2012 |                      |
| 2013 |                      |
| 2014 |                      |
| 2015 |                      |

| 2018 |                      |
| 2019 |                      |
| 2020 |                      |
| 2021 | 12,913               |

**CAGR:** 3.8% (2008-2021)

*   Healthcare costs are currently at all-time highs
*   At $4.3 trillion today, healthcare spend represents ~19% of GDP
*   Spend is projected to grow to $6.8 trillion by 2030

### Annual Contributions for Coverage

Employer and employee contributions have continued to increase

#### Annual Contributions for Coverage (Bar Chart Data)

| Contribution Type     | 2016        | 2021        |
| :-------------------- | :---------- | :---------- |
| Employer Contribution | $12,865 (71%) | $16,253 (73%) |
| Employee Contribution | $5,277      | $5,969      |
| Total                 | $18,142     | $22,221     |

**CAGR (2016-2021):**
*   Employer Contribution: 4.8%
*   Employee Contribution: 2.5%
*   Total: 4.1%

*   Health benefits are a key component of attracting and retaining employees
*   Continued increase in employer burden of employee healthcare costs
*   4.8% CAGR in average employer premium over the past five years

### Fully Insured vs. Self-Funded Plan Costs

Self-funding provides employers with additional visibility into healthcare costs compared to fully insured plans

#### Fully Insured
*   Non-Refundable Premium

#### Self-Funded
*   Potential Savings
*   Actual Claims
*   Stop-Loss Insurance
*   Administrative Costs

**Key Trends:**
*   Unsustainable Cost Trends **+** Increasing Employer and Employee Premiums **+** Increased Demand for Transparency
*   Self-funded plans provide greater price transparency, breaking down costs by component, and flexibility through customizable plans and solutions
*   Opportunity to keep savings due to effective management of healthcare costs and reduced utilization

## Slide 5: TPA Value Proposition Strengthening

TPAs are an essential component of a self-funded strategy and are in use now more than ever—orchestrating innovative cost containment measures for the payor and introducing difference-making advocacy services to members.

### The Benefits of Self-Funded Plan Administration

*   BSPs are designed to contain costs; employers (and other self-funded groups) can avoid perennial premium increases attributable to commercial payors, which they pass on to their employees
*   BSPs furnish employers with full access to member claim data, allowing them to identify member cost drivers and design better cost management and member advocacy strategies within their plans to suit members
*   In addition, as Transparency in Coverage proliferates, BSPs serve an essential compliance role

## Slide 6: TPAs Effectively Orchestrating Innovative Strategies

The employer market has long attempted various approaches to control healthcare costs. In order to see greater success in cost containment, newer, more sophisticated strategies are emerging—these are now a top priority for employers.

### Historical Approaches Have Failed to Effectively Reduce Employee Healthcare Costs

*   **Disease Management**
    *   Helping members with chronic illnesses through behavior change and routine adherence
*   **Utilization Management**
    *   Evaluation of the medical appropriateness of treatment, with the approval or denial of service or payment
*   **High Deductible Health Plan**
    *   Putting the bulk of the financial burden on the member to be more mindful in their healthcare spending
*   **Wellness**
    *   Preventative employer programs aimed at reducing the risk of chronic illness through compensatory incentives

### Employers Demand Innovative Strategies to Combat Inflating Healthcare Costs

*   **Payment Integrity**
    *   Ensuring the proper payment of claims, including medical bill review
*   **Reference-Based Pricing**
    *   Replacing contracted provider network rates with transparent and fair pricing based on reference benchmarks
*   **Direct Contracting**
    *   Enabling direct contractual relationships between providers and employers to drive cost savings
*   **Narrow Networks**
    *   Restricting a network to a smaller set of providers or PPO in exchange for advantageous pricing or more stringent standards
*   **Value-Based Contracts**
    *   Payment models focused on the quality of services provided, rather than just the quantity
*   **Rx/Program Management**
    *   Prescription drug plan management to optimize cost savings, medication adherence, and patient outcomes

Forward-thinking benefits solution providers are essential centerpieces within the employer health market—conducting the most innovative, ROI-driving strategies to reduce costs for the payer and add value to the member

## Slide 7: Regulations Mandating Transparency Spur Innovation

As regulators push for clarity around provider pricing, plan coverage, and balance billing through the introduction and amendment of enacted legislation, the competitive moat for scaled TPAs and other benefits solution providers will continue to deepen.

### Transparency in Coverage Rule

*   The Transparency in Coverage rule (TIC) requires employer-provided group health plans to provide cost-sharing information to members such as:
    *   Negotiated rates for covered items and services between the plan and in-network providers
    *   Historical payments and billed charges from out-of-network providers
    *   In-network rates and historical net prices for all covered prescription drugs
    *   Tools for enrollees to receive personalized out-of-pocket cost estimates for care
*   For plan years beginning in 2023, an online tool must provide cost-share estimates for 500 shoppable services, expanding to all covered services in 2024

#### Trends Driving Increased Usage of BSPs

*   **✓** Greater need for guidance on TIC's impact on self-insured plans
*   **✓** Increased risk of severe non-compliance penalties
*   **✓** Demand for innovative solutions promoting plan transparency
*   **✓** Tech-driven solutions provide insights and tools to better manage costs

### No Surprises Act

*   The No Surprises Act (NSA) includes several different requirements specifically affecting employer-provided group health coverage:
    *   Prescription drug and healthcare spending reporting
    *   An advanced explanation of benefits (EOB) requirement
    *   Medical/Rx identification card disclosure requirements
    *   Opportunity for consumers to appeal disputes over coverage
*   This ruling will likely result in employer-sponsored plans being burdened by increased medical costs
*   The plan sponsor of a self-insured plan can delegate reporting responsibility to a TPA, creating further demand for specialty outsourced solutions

### Value Proposition for Innovative Benefits Solution Providers

*   **$** Ability to contain costs and drive ROI
*   **☰** Guidance toward compliance and adherence
*   **📊** Responsibility for reporting

As transparency regulations stiffen, poorly capitalized competitors will be crowded out, catalyzing consolidation for carrier-owned TPA aggregators and increasing investment opportunities for employer-sponsored healthcare investors

*   Carrier-Owned TPAs now account for +50% of covered lives, continue to be acquisitive (especially BCBS affiliates), and offer steep discounts to retain existing and sign new members
*   Independent TPAs are setting pace with flexibility, service, custom networks, and value-add owned and vended solutions to lower costs and improve members' experience
*   Collectively, TPAs and other Benefits Solution Providers have attracted more private capital support than ever before
*   Interest in TPA platforms and expansion via tuck-in M&A is at peak level

## Slide 15: Case Study #1: Allied Benefit Systems

**Project:** 59

### Company Profile
Allied Benefit Systems (Allied) is a national healthcare solutions company that supports healthy workplace cultures. Founded in 1980, Allied has grown to be one of the largest independent TPAs in the U.S. Allied provides customized benefits solutions, medical management, and cost control strategies to more than 9,000 small and medium-sized employers—the fastest growing segment of the self-insured market. In addition, the company offers a broad array of network options, pharmacy solutions, and care management strategies to enable its customers to reduce costs and drive improved member satisfaction.

### Transaction Snapshot
The Houlihan Lokey deal team designed a quiet, custom sale process to maximize value while minimizing distraction. Houlihan Lokey maintained a highly competitive process through carefully targeted outreach while maintaining strict confidentiality throughout the entire process.

In February 2021, following a brief pause in summer 2020 due to COVID-19, Allied completed a majority recapitalization with Stone Point Capital. Stone Point's reputation as a value-add sponsor, along with its TPA experience, complementary portfolio, and value proposition to Allied shareholders, served as competitive differentiators in the process.

### Client Testimonial

– Mitch Wilneff, President, Allied Benefit Systems

### Buyer Testimonial
"We share management's enthusiasm regarding the partnership...We believe that the group health TPA market is poised for consolidation, and the company's full suite of innovative cost containment solutions, designed to help clients combat rising healthcare costs, will position the company for continued success.”
– Chuck Davis, CEO, Stone Point Capital

### Houlihan Lokey Role
Houlihan Lokey served as the exclusive financial advisor to Allied and assisted in initiating, structuring, and negotiating the transaction on its behalf.

## Slide 16: Case Study #2: Trustmark Health Benefits

**Project:** Transcend

### Company Profile
Trustmark Health Benefits (Health Benefits) is a leading third-party administrator of self-funded, employer-sponsored health plans. Health Benefits designs, implements, and administers custom plans to manage costs through innovative solutions, data transparency, and member-centric support.

Health Benefits' parent, Trustmark, through its operating divisions and subsidiaries, offers specialized expertise in voluntary benefits, self-funded health plan design and administration for smaller employers, and the delivery of wellness, fitness, recreation, and injury prevention and treatment programs.

### Transaction Snapshot
In October 2022, following a competitive, multistage process comprising varying buyer types and transaction structures, Trustmark completed the sale of Health Benefits to Health Care Service Corporation (HCSC).

In addition to favorable pricing and terms, HCSC's market reputation, cultural similarities to Trustmark, and retention of the existing management team served as competitive differentiators in the process. HCSC sweetened the deal by offering Trustmark incremental upside through a post-closing contingent consideration package and an ability to achieve it using HCSC's commercial capabilities.
