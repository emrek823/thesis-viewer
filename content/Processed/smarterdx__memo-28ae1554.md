SmarterDx Investment Memo

# OVERVIEW

# INVESTMENT DETAILS

## PRODUCT

Problem: Hospital payment hinges on accurate medical coding, yet c. 10 % of codes are wrong because physicians omit details; Clinical Documentation Specialists (CDSs) must pore over every chart with legacy tools that still demand word-by-word review – a 5-minute slog per chart → hospitals leave c. $20 B in annual revenue on the table and suffer lower quality scores

Solution: SmarterDx ingests 100 % of EMR data and uses custom-labeled AI to pre-identify missing or inaccurate diagnoses; CDSs simply click "agree / disagree" on suggested fixes, slashing review time to 0.5 min, enabling coverage of all charts and rapid capture of otherwise lost revenue

## INVESTMENT HIGHLIGHTS AND RISKS

Highlights

Risks

(?) Incumbent entrenchment: 3M and Iodine are deeply embedded in hospital workflows; displacing or layering on top of them may face long procurement cycles and political push-back
(?) Early stage execution: Company is pre-seed/seed with only pilot and LOI data; hitting the planned jump from $3M → $10M ARR in 18 months requires rapid scaling of sales, implementations and support
(?) Integration complexity: Solution relies on ingesting ‘ALL’ EMR data—interfaces, data quality and IT security reviews vary by health system and could extend deployment timelines
(?) Contingency pricing attribution: Revenue uplift must be provably tied to SmarterDx; disagreements over attribution or changes in coding regulations could compress realized fees
(?) Competitive response risk: Incumbents could add similar ML “suggest  click” features, narrowing SmarterDx’s speed advantage and compressing pricing power

## WHAT YOU NEED TO BELIEVE

Hospitals will adopt SmarterDx’s full-EMR AI that converts a 5-minute manual documentation hunt into a 0.5-minute agree/disagree click, enabling every chart to be reviewed, eliminating 10 % coding errors and unlocking $20 B of lost U.S. hospital revenue while safeguarding quality ratings

Why now: Diagnosis sets that drive payment and quality have exploded from ~50 codes in the 1990s to 250 in the 2010s and 1,000+ tomorrow, making traditional nurse-led or NLP-only workflows untenable; hospitals facing post-pandemic margin pressure and public score scrutiny are actively looking for tech that recovers revenue fast—SmarterDx’s live pilots showing +$12 M, +$10 M, +$6 M lifts validate readiness for rapid budget reallocation today

Why them: Founder-physicians Michael Gao MD and Josh Geleris MD bring deep clinical insight while CTO-caliber quant Nathan Perilo has built large-scale data systems; their proprietary pipeline ingests ALL EMR data with custom labels—surpassing 3M and Iodine’s NLP-first approach—and early customers across academic and community hospitals have already signed or signaled seven-figure deals, evidencing the team’s ability to sell into complex health-system procurement and turn technical differentiation into tangible dollars

## PRODUCT ROADMAP

## TRACTION

⇒ Early commercial momentum with clear value proof: pilots converted into multi-$1M opportunities across leading health-systems  

• Quantified ROI at first three live clients: +$12 M (Academic MC, NC), +$10 M (Academic MC, NY), +$6 M (Community Hosp, MT) incremental revenue on top of incumbent 3M/Iodine solutions  
• Pipeline of signed / near-term deals >$6 M: East Coast Hosp $1.2 M, Midwest Hosp $1.2 M, PREMIER (NASDAQ:PINC) $1.0 M, additional $800 K / $700 K / $600 K tiers, AMN Healthcare (NYSE:AMN) $400 K  
• Paid validation work already underway: $200 K early pilots and $80 K consulting engagement, plus micro-pilots ($0–$10 K) seeding future upsells  
• Go-to-market ramp: Product development completed pre-Q3 ’21 → proof-of-value Q3 ’21 → AMN referral channel launched Q4 ’21 → accelerating direct  channel sales Q1 ’22  
• Targets in sight: 7 health-system installs / $1.2 M ARR by H1 ’22; 22 installs / $2.7 M ARR by H2 ’22; $9.9 M ARR by H1 ’23  
• Contingency-based pricing resonating with CFOs; “freemium” analytics outreach and partnerships with AMN Healthcare  Premier provide leveraged distribution  
• $3 M seed raise underway to fuel sales hiring and integrations, expected to carry company to $3 M ARR inside 12 months and $10 M ARR within 18 months
