Interview conducted on September 11, 2023

## Topics
Clinical Trials, Pharmaceutical Industry, Payments and Logistics, Compliance, API Capabilities, Cost Containment

## Summary
The VP of Pharmacovigilance & interim VP of Clinical Development at Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc spoke with the Tegus Client about their positive experience with Mural Health. They have been a paid customer for 18 months and have expanded their studies from one trial to two Phase I and three Phase II studies. Mural Health's system allows for easy payments and logistics management, and it is 21 CFR Part 11 certified. While currently limited to domestic trials, there are plans to expand globally. The VP expressed satisfaction with Mural Health's services and their ability to streamline processes and reduce costs. The expert confirms that Mural Health is a fit for both centralized and decentralized trials. They have tested the platform in Phase I, Phase II, and are currently testing it for a Phase IV study with positive results. The number of transactions per patient increases with the number of visits and treatments, with oncology and high-impact indications having the highest number of transactions. Any study with more than two visits per quarter per participant would benefit from using Mural Health. The upfront expense is around $10,000 per study with maintenance fees of $100 to $150 per patient per quarter. The VP of Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc explains that as they increased the number of studies, the ROI ranged from 25% to 45% per year. They emphasize the importance of compliance and the value of using a system that allows for tracking and budget control. The VP states that their work with Mural Health has saved the company millions in the 1.5 years they have been working together. Mural Health offers multiple payment methods and real-time communication with the EDC system, making it more efficient than Greenphire. Mural Health has had a positive impact on participant retention and site satisfaction. The VP believes that Mural Health can potentially expedite the drug development process by improving patient participation and site efficiency. The VP acknowledges the gap between sponsors, clinical research sites, and participants and suggests that Mural Health's portal for patient feedback could help bridge it. They also mention the importance of case studies and analytics to demonstrate the effectiveness of Mural Health to sponsors.

## Tegus Client
Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today about Mural Health. To start off, could you please give us a quick overview of your background and the company that you're with and how you got introduced to Mural Health?

## VP - Pharmacovigilance & interim VP of Clinical Development at Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc
Yes. I've been in the industry for almost 22 years. I do clinical development and R&D. KPTI, MedPacto and Nexus is a conglomerate system right now because we purchase and cultivate intellectual properties in early-stage, late-stage development products, unlike your typical single arm of a company or a CRO, we're amalgamated of two for all practical purposes.

Therefore, it allows me to work with the collaborations of combination therapy, as we actually use our own IMPs investigational medicinal products. I identified a need that we didn't have when I to KPTI, Karyo, some four years ago. And prior to that, when we had a clinical trial, all payments to the participants, the patients and the consumers, depends on what clinical trial we were running.

As well as providing the payments and following up with the payments and following up with the individuals and who gets what and when and how, providing logistics to the patients, hypothetically if the patient needed assisted disability transportation logistics or the patient needed to go to the offsite study place.

As simple as that, the patient had to go get themselves the transportation, either call the site and the site will call us, a lot of manual process in order to get an approval. Then the patient would go and pay for it or we provided a voucher. Later on, we learned that we could actually produce an Uber voucher, which that made a difficult process and so on and so forth.

We needed a system that does all of that. And we were not going to be charged an arm and a leg for the ancillary project management cost that usually contract research organization would charge us. Because any of the logistics that I just explained would give us additional charges and change of work order would come into picture, sometimes as much as 15% to 20% of the total budget of the clinical trial itself.

In other words, if a budget goes for a Phase IV of a non-site $85,000 per patient to about $225,000 Phase I/II of oncology trial with the on-site and off-site participation. Imagine 10%, 15% per patient goes up just for these additional logistic project management charges, not the base cost, but that.

So we went around and there were some companies that they would provide payments, but they wouldn't provide other things, and I'll explain what I mean by that. Companies like Greenphire, PayQuicker, Zura Bio, InnaMed, there are quite a few of these companies that provide logistics one-off, payment one-off. But the way they work is you have to give them the requisition.

You go on the portal, you provide a requisition. You have to tell them which site or which individual. And then they have to make a payment and/or they would, again, manually and semi-manually provide the logistics. Like they would get Uber for them or they would send the PayPal, if you will, or Zelle to the patients for additional charges for the participation costs and things as such.

Now Mural Health has one portal, all you have to do CSR or AVX, the list of the participants and/or sites and/or. So whoever you want to pay, whichever the account, you would load it up or, for additional costs, you would ask them to API it. In other words, they would produce the interface with your SAP. Or they would API it with other electronic systems like your EDC, electronic data capture. So technically and practically, you would be able to tell your EDC when the time comes that a payment is due for the site X. And that payment speaks to our SAP.

And our SAP, would allow their API to release the cost, and we get invoiced for it. And/or we actually produce a debit system with Mural Health X amount of dollars. At first, we had to produce a debit, because they're a small company, and we didn't have that level of confidence in the process. So we gave them one trial, eight sites. That's where the whole thing started. And then we gave them multiple studies and multiple sites. So that's how the progress occurred and the why and how are they helping today. I hope that makes sense.

## Tegus Client
Super helpful. So when did you become a paid customer and walk me through what that upsell looked like. It sounded like you started with one trial across eight sites. Where is that looking today?

## VP - Pharmacovigilance & interim VP of Clinical Development at Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc
When? It's about 18 months ago. We had a trial run of about three months with only one study, eight sites of Phase I with minimal amount of using their services without an API. Then at the end of that trial, we had the application program interface done with our SAP and EDC. We alpha and beta ran it. It looked like it's working. And then we gave them two more studies about a year ago.

And as of six, seven months ago, now we're up to two Phase Is and three Phase IIs. And we're hoping to increase the upcoming Phase IIIs and potentially one Phase IV into 2025 that it goes online also. Now for the Phase I and II, this is low volume, low number of transactions. But for a Phase IV, it's going to be high volume, high number of transactions.

Because 1,800 patients, instead of providing the patients individually with a Visa card that they go to a local pharmacy and they get their co-INPs and treatment related to adverse events, products, OTCs that they have to get and things like that, this way, the patient gets reimbursed at the value cost.

So we know exactly what the CVS Walgreens would charge them. And then we reimburse them on those levels at the flat fee. So the site doesn't have to get involved. CRO doesn't have to get involved. The patient directly gets paid. And by the way, the system has to be 21 CFR Part 11, which is the FDA ruling before the clinical trials.

And the difference between Mural Health as opposed to the rest that I know of, the competition, it's at least a validated 21 CFR Part 11. So other companies like Zura Bio or Greenphire, they're compliant with 21 CFR Part 11, but they're not certified, if you will, or at least they don't tell us that they're certified.

They keep on staying compliant and as a part of due diligence record, we ask them for compliance certification, we just get a response that they are compliant, but there is no certification. But Mural Health provided us the certification. I think Eurofins did it. Now the significance of Eurofins is we could use Eurofin, which is traditionally a European system, for our global trials.

So Phase III and the IV that I was talking about, which is definitely global as opposed to Phase Is and IIs that we're currently doing or the Phases I and II that we're running, they're only domestic, there are no sites that Mural Health is involved with our global system. Still, the global is being done manually as in the past.

But for the Phase III and IV studies, using what we have, which is a certification process of Eurofins, and hopefully, we have to do one another set of certification with that. Then we can use them, which we're not going to have a problem with EMC, the European Medicinal authority system. So that is also an added bonus to have that.

## Tegus Client
Got it. So it sounds like, today, the use case is limited to domestic trials within the United States, but you see a very clear path checking the necessary regulatory and/or compliance boxes to be able to take the solution globally. Did I follow that?

## VP - Pharmacovigilance & interim VP of Clinical Development at Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc
That's exactly what it is. First, we have to run it with our global studies in the EU as a part of the European Medicinal authority, EMA, to be compliant with them. And then hopefully, down the road, which we do have that plan post 2024-2025, we have to think about potential APAC, which is, for us, South Korea and China. But that's another leap of faith that we have to think about.

## Tegus Client
Got it. And then what about the types of trials? Are these decentralized? Are they centralized, hybrid?

## VP - Pharmacovigilance & interim VP of Clinical Development at Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc
That's a good point. Right now, we're only doing centralized. But for the Phase III and IV, they are actually hybrid and decentralized. But even for the centralized trial, you could call them hybrid, because some of the patients needed to receive ancillary care and/or workup and/or other investigative tooling associated with the trial itself, radiography, off-site labs and so on and so forth, off-site and not necessarily traveling to the site.

Because of that, it helped us that way because then we didn't have to go into the system and keep on changing the point of service in order to adjust the costs and adjusting the level of compensation for the patients. The system would actually read through it without the manual interference.

## Tegus Client
Got it. So I was under the impression that Mural Health may have been a better fit for decentralized trials, but it sounds like you are finding value with centralized as well. Can you help me understand what about Mural Health is a fit for centralized and decentralized, the pros and cons or differences between those two?

## VP - Pharmacovigilance & interim VP of Clinical Development at Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc
Okay. So the first question is decentralized versus centralized, what's the difference of them? And the answer to that is, by definition, anything more than 75% of the provided goods and services to the patient in the process of clinical trial, if they are done at the point of service of the clinical site, it's called a centralized clinical trial.

Now if the value point, in other words, the number of the hours the patient potentially will spend in treatment and visits below the 75%, then it becomes hybrid or decentralized. Now the lower the number, the closer you become to a concept sheet of a decentralized. A true decentralized study is one of those studies that the patient will do, let's say, remote ICF, the patient would do a remote consent.

And then the patient will sign the paperwork remotely. The patient will be trained remotely on the dos and the don'ts. The patient would receive their meds remotely, and the patient would actually proceed with the study completely remotely. I'm not aware of a fully decentralized study yet for any process of new drug application, NDA, or biologic licensing application.

I am aware of decentralized studies, not in my therapeutic area. I do oncology immunology, some CNS, about 25% CNS in neurosciences and about 10% in rare disease, mostly rare disease in associated immunology and oncology. But I've been told of fully decentralized studies, but mostly in dermatology, cosmetics and things like that. And most of them are safety studies, which are their Phase I.

But truth to be told is most of the current studies, high-paying studies, if you catch my drift by hyping, studies that they have high cost per patient per study as opposed to the other studies that we're talking about, lower volume in number of patients, participants and patients, but the higher cost per patient, they're usually centralized or hybrid.

And the level of hybrid will go lower as we move forward. And that's the trend. We're trying to decentralize as much as possible. But in oncology and CNS and rare disease that I work on, that's really not as quickly as could be done in other areas, that meaning men's and women's health and so on and so forth.

## Tegus Client
That makes perfect sense, the delineation. So it sounds like Mural Health is a fit for both decentralized, centralized and hybrids. Is that right?

## VP - Pharmacovigilance & interim VP of Clinical Development at Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc
I would think so. But then again, our primary cause of using them has been the cost-containing and application program interface capability that it has for both the duality itself, lowering the costs at the same time, making life easier for us. And we use them for hybrid and centralized. So it's been working for us.

## Tegus Client
That makes sense. And then what about the actual stage of the study? You talked about this working on Phase Is and IIs, but eventually, IIIs and IVs. Does Mural Health have the capacity or does the value proposition make sense across all of those stages or only certain stages?

## VP - Pharmacovigilance & interim VP of Clinical Development at Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc
Yes. So one is the type of studies, which phases of studies, which is lower in number of the patients, I mean Phase I is up to 23 patients, plus or minus. You can go to extended Phase Ib to about 35, 40 patients in some studies. And then you go, let's say, up to a couple of hundred in Phase II and then 300 to 400 up to probably 800 in a Phase III, the number of the patients.

The question is not the number of the patients, the average number of transaction per year per patient per study, those are the questions that you should ask in a system like this. And the answer to that is, based on the studies we do a test run with them. So in other words, we don't put all the patients at the same time to start getting their services from a system like Mural Health. We do it in stages.

As I explained, we did a Phase I and then Phase II, which is 23 plus or minus patients, and we did like up to a couple of hundred. Now we're doing a test like an alpha function for compression of about 1,500 patients for a Phase IV, which is going in line end of 2024. And it looks like they're passing with the flying colors. So the long answer was what I gave you, but the short answer, it looks like they could actually take the compression.

## Tegus Client
Got it. So you said the way we should think about this platform is the average number of transactions per patient. Help me understand that and unpack that a little bit.

## VP - Pharmacovigilance & interim VP of Clinical Development at Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc
Sure. So a typical study has your protocol, and as part of protocol, you have a table of visits and treatments. It would tell you how often the patient is supposed to go to the site, health care professional and/or to be tested for whatever, how often the patient is supposed to receive a product and how often the patient needs to have an interaction. Now as a number of the treatments and the visits go up, the number of the transactions for the patient goes up.

In other words, the patient needs transportation, which means we have to make payments to the patient. The patient potentially needs drug to be delivered to them or purchase the drug. Or they have to walk into a Walgreens and get their OTC and so on and so forth. And the site has to compensate them every time they come and go to the site. Also the patient potentially needs transportation to and from for unscheduled visits.

And the number of the unscheduled visits increase per study as the cause of them. And usually, it's adverse events and/or potential unscheduled visits for workup and unanticipated workups. So a typical study may have no more than five or six visits hypothetically in some therapeutic area. But a typical study for some other therapeutic area, like in oncology, it's the highest number of treatment visits, patients spending time and potential opportunity for unscheduled visits.

So a typical study that is done in oncology or immune disease or maybe chronic and high impacted indications in CNS, such as MS, relapsed/refractory, they have the highest number of those transactions as opposed to the studies, let's say, in just medicine. You come in, you get your topical, you go home. That's only one visit every three months.

Versus what we do, every three weeks, the patient has to have four or five visits to different centers and do different things. Because of that, we have to look at the compression point, how many times these transactions are going to occur for the same patients, how compliant the transactions are supposed to be, how reliable they are, lines down, compressions associated with the total number of the transactions in one shot.

Imagine, all of a sudden, we have to make payments to the sites, hypothetically. Well, they're all happening within the first week of the month or the first week of the quarter. And if the number of the sites for a Phase IV goes to about 100 to 300 to 600, there's a high scale of compression occurring. So those are the things that we have to be worried about when we have a platform like this.

## Tegus Client
Got it. And as you think about the number of transactions per patient, is there a threshold at which something like Mural Health is a good fit for, meaning anything below that transaction volume, you don't need something like Mural Health and after a certain number of transactions you do? Does that make sense?

## VP - Pharmacovigilance & interim VP of Clinical Development at Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc
Perfectly. And the answer to that is, any time you have more than two visits per quarter per participant in a study, it actually starts paying for itself to have them. Because don't forget, when you bring a company like Mural Health, first, we have to spend money to become interfaced with them. There is an internal and external cost associated with that. Then there is money to be paid for the services.

## Tegus Client
How much is that roughly? How much is that expense to start interfacing with them?

## VP - Pharmacovigilance & interim VP of Clinical Development at Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc
We negotiated at around $10,000 per study. So every study that we will sign up with them for the registration of that study was somewhere around there. So immediately, around $10,000 for 23 patients is shy of about $300 to $500 upfront that we have to put in. So the question was, so it's $500 per patient upfront. And then there is a maintenance fee that we have to pay, which is around $100 to $150 per patient per quarter.

And then there is a seat we purchase, which is around $10,000 per year per portal per individual. That's one password, one user. And usually, we have three of them for project managers to do. So if you add up all of those costs, we did that and anywhere between 5% to 20% upcharge that the CRO used to do. And when we did the ROI, it definitely paid for itself and then some in the bag and chips.

## Tegus Client
And as you were calculating the ROI, how do you think about total cost to value and what that ROI was?

## VP - Pharmacovigilance & interim VP of Clinical Development at Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc
So the way we did it, there was a sliding scale, and I don't remember exactly, but once we went more than one study, just one study. In other words, from one study, we went to three studies. From three studies, we're going to five studies and five studies to more than that, which is eight studies, both with the Phase III and IV into it. As we were going up, the return on investment was more than 25% to 45% per year.

With one big difference, and that's compliance, which is a binary, if you will. It's invaluable. You can't put a value to this KPC. In using a system like this, I not only know how much is given to whom, when and how. And I have a backtrack system in place. I would never go over my budget this way. So that would stop the payment. Not even $0.01 extra is going to be spent unless I approve it.

Usually, with the other system, which is manual process through the CRO, I have never seen not go over the budget for these compensations ever, because truth to be told is everything is done manually. And you have to spend anywhere between $35 to $75 per person per account to actually do the manual calculation. SAP doesn't do it for you. ADC doesn't do it for you. You have to do it all manually.

So if you put all of that, the 60% to 70% is easily attainable. That's 60% to 70% of the total cost of those ancillary upcharges. So if we can do a backward minimum of 5% to 10% per patient, per study. Now one study can go as much as three years. So for $250,000 of the patient, you work backwards. It's about $60,000 to $70,000 per patient per year and 5% to 10% of 6,000. Now added up to the total number of the patients, it easily pays up.

We did a calculation. Our work with them alone has saved the company millions so far in the 1.5 years that we've had as opposed to what we would have done and then as I said, you have the invaluability of compliance because everything is traceable, we could easily see it. Another thing is it's invaluable for you to keep the participants and the patients happy and the sites happy. Because don't forget, they're going through a dreadful disease of cancer. Their caregivers are involved. They themselves are inconvenienced for everything that they're supposed to receive and not received.

If I am late for giving them a hydrocortisone 2% for just 24 hours, they're not very happy. And unhappy participants mean lack of compliance with the study. So all of that adds up, so to speak. And we couldn't put a value, obviously, to those. We just go with the upcharge of the CRO versus what we pay them versus what the patients benefit from it.

## Tegus Client
Yes. You mentioned saving millions in the 1.5 years that you've been working with Mural Health. That sounds like a lot in isolation. But when you put that in the context of the amount of money that's spent taking drugs to trial, that actually could be only a pretty small amount.

So can you help maybe contextualize that number for me a bit more, I know a lot of sponsors out there will go and spend whatever they need to, to bring these drugs they'll pay off CROs, a misallocation of like, let's say, the CRO is asking for more money. They just round up thousands and hundreds of thousands of dollars without even thinking, because if they bring these drugs to market, they pay off in such a handsome way. So how do you contextualize that and piece those two things together?

## VP - Pharmacovigilance & interim VP of Clinical Development at Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc
So what percentage of your total budget associated with all the studies that they are participating this program in equals to a few million? I have to do a little bit of calculation off the top of my head. You have to appreciate that in this case, it is a lot of saving, because it's about 5% to 10% of the total expenditure associated with the engaging patients. And that's a lot of money. In other words, by using a system like that, potentially I could save about 5% to 10% of the total budget.

## Tegus Client
Got it. So you mentioned how you piece together what you're paying from a price point standpoint. My understanding is, every time you have a new clinical trial project, you are basically repricing the solution. So could you maybe walk me through the different price points of what you're paying across the various projects you're running? What that range is because I know it varies project-to-project.

## VP - Pharmacovigilance & interim VP of Clinical Development at Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc
Yes. Every clinical trial has a different table of treatment and visits. Every patient as opposed to the other set of patients in the other study, they would have different visits. And not every visit is the same. In other words, one visit may take 0.5 hour, one visit may take three hours. There are visits that a patient has to stay overnight, hypothetically.

So the participation cost, the ancillary costs associated with that, the provided services that something like Mural Health does in lieu of what I just said differs from one study to another. A typical patient would get an average of $150 per visit per study in the life of the study. A typical patient would have at least one visit. We call it a visit, but it's not necessarily a visit per week throughout the study.

So a typical patient would have 52 of those. And this is just a rudimentary cost value proposition. So a typical patient would have about $5,000 per year in remuneration process associated with what we're talking about. And in addition to that, you probably would double that, the cost of the patient is.

In other words, for the transportation, you have to pay consumable products that they have to, like Band-Aid and things like that they may need to use. During the COVID, we used to pay for them to purchase masks at one point because they had to do visits and stuff like that. They'd have masks on. So we provided all of that. So a typical patient would have anything about $7,500 per year, if you will, allotted to them.

Now by using a system like this, that $7,500 usually goes to about $9,500, $9,800. Now using a system like that will shave off about $2,000, $3,000 per patient. So if you add it up to the 23 patients that we just said, immediately, you shaved off $40,000 year one.

But the only cost to me for that study for those 23 patients for the Mural Health would be somewhere around $20,000 to $25,000. But as the number of the studies increase, we are renegotiating the startup costs and everything else. So it's got to come down. That's the reason we're saving 50% to 60% in the total cost. So that's just the cost. Again, the ease of the operation, the compliance associated with it, the facilitation associated with these patients and logistics, those are invaluable to speak of. The less headache that we have to go through with the CRO, that by itself is invaluable.

## Tegus Client
Got it. And how familiar are you with Greenphire? Have you used that solution in the current company?

## VP - Pharmacovigilance & interim VP of Clinical Development at Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc
Yes, we used Greenphire right before we fully got Mural Health. Greenphire primarily does payments, very good. And it does electronic communication and sends like prepaid debit cards like a Visa and Mastercard that we used to send to the patients for them to go buy their OTCs and stuff like that. We didn't use them for like application development or anything else that they were trying to sell us. So our use was limited to the myriad of the services that they sell.

## Tegus Client
Got it. And is Mural Health and Greenphire, should we think of those as one-to-one, meaning they're like equivalent competitors? Where are the gaps are in each?

## VP - Pharmacovigilance & interim VP of Clinical Development at Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc
Yes. So for instance, Greenphire claims to do electronic communication tools. But when you think about it, electronic communication tools is the API that you have to think about, the interfaces that you're supposed to do. Well, it only interfaces with QuickBooks. Almost all medium-sized and large biopharmas, we are considered to be medium sized, they use SAP. Well, Greenphire doesn't have API because they're not a global partner of SAP. And we all use SAP. So that by itself is a major disadvantage to them.

In other words, their system doesn't work well with SAP. They do have a no-code interface, which has major issues. So I don't recommend it, at least to the last diligence that we did, I don't recommend them for that. Communication that they talk about, like app development, they have a single app, and I think it's an Oracle app that they use.

And on the front end, it's their app. On the back end, it's Oracle app. It's extremely limited in the use as opposed to Mural Health, the development that they have. As far as the payment system, Mural Health does multiple PIM. You could get it in Zelle, your money. You could get it in an electronic Visa card on your smartphone. You could get it even in, what's that, Cash App.

There are like five or six different ways you could get your money. They could do global. And Greenphire, the only global that they do is PayPal. Well, not everybody can get PayPal, plus there's a 3% loss on the PayPal part that we can talk about. There are a lot of differences. Like the communication that they do.

For instance, when a payment is made to the patient, it's supposed to talk to the EDC. Their system works in the form of a data dump to EDC. In other words, it's not a real-time communication with the EDC, electronic data capture, system. But Mural Health directly talks to the EDC. In other words, when the EDC says patient X is supposed to go off-site and do their lab work, it would automatically generate an Uber electronic token and things like that.

Now imagine in a large volume, this is extremely valuable. So the patient would have absolutely no issues doing that. Because of the things that I just said, you can't do one-on-one with them. The closer company that we came with is Prolocor.

The problem with Prolocor is it's extremely European-oriented, the way the system is. I think they're French, if I'm not mistaken. So the issue with that is they are a SAP partner but they're not Oracle partner. So they do exactly the same thing that I said there's a no-code interface for the EDC. Again, they have to do a data dump, and then they have to do reconciliation. Their communication system doesn't work. The number of the methods of payments are very, very limited. You can't even get electronic tokens of the Visa with them to do a dump on your smartphone. These are very helpful nowadays. Makes it a lot easier for people.

They don't have to wait for us to send them something in the mail. Everything comes to their cell phone. It's all trackable. So because of that, I would say Greenphire is not the one-on-one if you want to compare. They do some services, it's like a payment and stuff like that, but not the whole spectrum of set of services that you need.

## Tegus Client
Got it. And how much customization did Mural Health do for you versus they have an API that's more universal that could plug in and help, call it, any medium-sized company like yours?

## VP - Pharmacovigilance & interim VP of Clinical Development at Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc
We didn't do that much of customization per se. We did have some hiccups at the beginning to make sure that the system definitely works, their claim versus our test run. So we were supposed to have a test run of a sandbox about 1.5 months, and it took us about three months to compliant check it, so to speak. Now I don't know the problem was because we weren't doing a good job to work with them or they weren't doing a good job or their system had problem. I don't know. But we did have some issues.

Things weren't working. They were claiming that it was because of the Internet sometimes, which I don't know. It shouldn't be. They were claiming that the cell phones that we were using that were on different systems, like you're using Verizon or someone. And that doesn't make sense to me. We did it both on the different Wi-Fi systems. They said it's a security Wi-Fi. Because we have to test run it in different sandbox systems, in different environments before we say yes to it.

But outside of that, if you call that customization. But outside of that, it wasn't that bad. It was only 2x as far as the time is. And our 45 days amalgamation, lead time is pretty aggressive across different systems in this industry. In other words, in my past life, a not so typical system like that with Cognizant or Accenture would take me probably 4x as much, like as much as six months.

## Tegus Client
To walk through that?

## VP - Pharmacovigilance & interim VP of Clinical Development at Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc
Output and exactly in sandbox.

## Tegus Client
Yes. Shifting gears just a bit as we think about the value proposition that you've realized around the solution. Have you seen any improvement to participant retention, for example?

## VP - Pharmacovigilance & interim VP of Clinical Development at Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc
Absolutely. Retention to us is a number of the patients in this concept. Retention means premature discontinuation of the patients without cost, in other words. And the answer to that is it's very difficult for us to nail it down. We think it has been because we talk to the patients and they say, oh, they love it because of the facility and facilitation associated with their logistics and payments and everything else.

The other part is, not just the retention, but keeping the sites happy and it's invaluable because the retention is three ways. We're happy, so we're more aggressive to use the sites and the patients who are participating in the study. More so than us is the sites, they are happy because their patients are happy, because they get paid fast, easy, no issues, this and that.

Last but not least, the patients would not drop off because we're just yanking their chain, so to speak, in the process. And they don't have to be waiting and all of that. Because of these three pillars of so-called retention that you were talking about, the answer to that is yes, definitely a positive impact.

## Tegus Client
And do you have any quantifiable metric to point to that shows an increase there?

## VP - Pharmacovigilance & interim VP of Clinical Development at Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc
No. We have to do more than 18 months, to be honest with you. At least we have to wait for at least two or three Phase II studies to close and compare them in the previous dropout rate and then come back and find that what we have done. So the root cause analysis to do that analysis is not as easy as doing it in 18 months while the studies are running. So the answer to that is no, I don't have numbers to give you.

## Tegus Client
All good. What about just qualitative feedback from the sites themselves or from participants? Anything there that you could point to?

## VP - Pharmacovigilance & interim VP of Clinical Development at Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc
The sites love it. My project managers, they love it because life is a lot easier for them, less spending time on doing manual, redundant and mind-boggling tasks. Patients love it, and we get that feedback from the sites all the time that they love this system. It's very easy. The patient just chooses how they want to get paid.

The Uber token goes to them as quickly as you can imagine. They don't have to put a requisition and then they have to wait for their money. Sometimes they have to give them an invoice. It's 22nd century type of discussion versus 19th century production level. people are happy.

And you ought to appreciate something else. I work in an environment that the patients that we have that are less patient in their conduct of daily routine. If I had cancer, I would be extremely impatient. I don't want to be yanked off, my Uber is not here, and I have to pay $60 to go to the site and get infusion.

I could relate to that. Plus in follicular lymphoma, we deal with elderly patients that they have cancer. So we deal with those populations. Imagine for a pediatric osteosarcoma study that we do also. So these are very, I would think, good quality value to think of. And that's how I sold it to the CEO, not to the Board.

## Tegus Client
Yes. And speed to market, I know that's something that we've heard as well that by using something like Mural Health, companies are able to actually increase their time to taking a new drug to market. Is that something that you've experienced? I know you probably need more time to pass there as well. But how do you think about that from a value proposition perspective?

## VP - Pharmacovigilance & interim VP of Clinical Development at Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc
So you're bringing a good point. You're looking for a tangible evidence associated with a utilized tool, which would directly or indirectly translate into expedited process of getting the product to the market. The answer to that is, it is tangible. Is it a primary direct value proposition, I don't know if you could measure it that way. What I could say is this, the positive impact associated with the patient participation and a site expediency in the process is positive enough to say it makes life a lot easier. Now let me flip the coin a little bit differently to answer this.

If the site is having competing trials and my study has Mural Health to help the site and the patients versus the other one, which does not, and this is apple-to-apple patient population for inclusion/exclusion criteria, I can assure you the study coordinators will put their available patients on my study first before they put it on their study.

And we do face that situation a lot in the competitive space in oncology. And because of what I just said, one would say, yes, it would make life a lot easier for the company to take a drug to the market because it would improve the accrual, which is participation rate.

## Tegus Client
Makes sense. And on a scale of one to 10, one low, 10 high, how likely are you to refer Mural Health to a friend or a colleague?

## VP - Pharmacovigilance & interim VP of Clinical Development at Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc
Very high. I would say an eight to 10, depends on cost value proposition they have, how small the company is. If the company is the same size with the same challenges that we had with the CROs and stuff, which I would say all medium to large companies they have, a tool like Mural Health would be helpful.

I don't know how their intellectual property is and how easy would it be for someone else to come from the left flank and just copy their process. To be honest with you, I don't know. But assuming all of those are tight, then I would say it's a unicorn, so to speak, in the myriad of the products that they have associated with this logistic facility and expediency.

## Tegus Client
Makes sense. And I have this working hypothesis that there's a gap between the sponsors of clinical studies, the sites that are actually administering the studies and the participants, where the participants in the clinical research sites, they have a negative experience with a lot of these more legacy incumbent payment and transportation options.

But the sponsors aren't necessarily aware of that pain point. So the sponsor, which is ultimately the one who is paying for these solutions, a pay per solution like Mural Health, they are satisfied, so they won't necessarily change, but it's because they lack like a closeness or a proximity to the actual end user of the product. How would you react to that? Do you think that's true? How would you sort of think about that?

## VP - Pharmacovigilance & interim VP of Clinical Development at Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc
Yes, it's definitely true. The problem is sponsors, generally they won't get that feedback from the patients or they don't get the primary feedback from the site coordinators that they are on the first line of fire by the patients. Now Mural Health does have a portal that will allow the patients to provide masked, blinded feedback communication directly to the sponsor.

So essentially, they could tell the sponsor, hey, you're messing up here or you're messing up there. And that's a masked, blinded response coming to us. In other words, if they're unhappy about something, we'll get to know it. And we haven't used that portal. And the Mural Health, they call it, I think, Patient Link or Communication Link. I forgot what they call, or Dynamic Link.

But having a tool like that, I think especially in the large scale Phase III and IV that we're having, we should be thinking about doing that, because that gives us exactly what you just said, positive or negative feedback, which helps us not to have that disconnect, because absolutely, the space has the disconnect between the patients, participants and the sponsors.

Usually, the sponsors wouldn't hear it. First the site hears it. And if we're lucky, we get some feedback through the site, CRO and then us. It's like grapevine. We don't get a direct appreciation. And don't forget, we always had these accrual process that we are dealing with. Patients don't want to participate or the patients drop out and things they're unhappy with.

Even compliance, Imagine the patient compliance. In other words, the patients are just frustrated with the study. They say, I just don't want to do it. It's a lot easier to tip the point than a cancer patient to say, I don't want to be a participant.

I mean with all the respect to all of us in this space, that is the tool of, I would say, at least a weapon for the patient. Because imagine if you push the patient to that frustration that they don't want to get what's necessary for them to survive, which is inhumane. So if you appeal on those levels, I would say having tools like this is invaluable.

## Tegus Client
Got it. What about for Mural trying to sell into a sponsor? If that gap exists, how difficult or easy is it for them to actually sell in a new solution? Does that make sense?

## VP - Pharmacovigilance & interim VP of Clinical Development at Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc
So the sponsors, they are aware of this gap. I think the challenge for Mural Health is to show that not only that gap has been well thought out and mitigated, but actually they have case studies showing that, that gap is, in fact, bridged because of the use of Mural Health.

If they could make that simple for us, black and white it, we had 150 participant patients, we did this questionnaire, and these are the responses they gave us. Because of that, we believe it's going to help, this and that. I can come up with a simple analytics of the presentation that you could actually whiteboard this, dashboard the salesmanship and the message. And if you message it properly to the sponsors, it's very easy for the sponsors to appreciate that.

## Tegus Client
Got it. Thank you so much for the time. This has been extremely helpful. And I hope you have a good rest of the day.
