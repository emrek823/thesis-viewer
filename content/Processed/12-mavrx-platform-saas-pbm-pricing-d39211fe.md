## Slide 6: Why PBMs Win with Our PMPM Guarantee

**MavRx**
by WriteWise

**Why PBMs Win with Our PMPM Guarantee**

**The Challenge**
Most PMPM guarantees in the market are synthetic — built on old claims data, inflated with exclusions, and lacking actuarial credibility.

**The WriteWise Solution**
WriteWise enables PBMs to issue real, risk-backed PMPM guarantees:
*   Built on predictive analytics (trend, churn, manual rates, volatility)
*   Modeled at the NDC level, not channel averages
*   Receives underwriting credit of 15% on average on Medical Stop Loss policies
*   Delivered in minutes, not weeks

**Outcome:** Data-backed, future-looking pricing you can confidently stand behind.
