## Slide 1: HealthScope

**HealthScope**
Training AI to understand—then defeat—every disease

Jan 2024 - confidential

## Slide 2: Disease "training data" will be bottlenecked by sample collection

Disease "training data" will be bottlenecked by sample collection
Biological data is getting cheaper to produce, but samples are not

**Chart Description: Cost over time for data generation and sample collection.**

*   **X-axis:** Implied time (moving left to right)
*   **Y-axis:** Cost

*   A downward sloping curve labeled "Data generation e.g. multi-omics" shows cost decreasing over time.
*   A horizontal dotted line labeled "Sample collection e.g. phlebotomy" shows a constant cost.
*   A vertical line labeled "Today" intersects the data generation curve at a point where its cost is still above the sample collection cost. To the right of "Today", the data generation cost drops below the sample collection cost, indicating that sample collection becomes the bottleneck.

## Slide 3: HealthScope is building a "full-stack" longitudinal biobank

HealthScope is building a "full-stack" longitudinal biobank
The foundation for reinventing medicine—and a $1T opportunity

**Diagram Description:**
This diagram illustrates the inputs into a biobank and the outputs (applications).

**Inputs (top row):**
*   Medical records
*   Imaging
*   Blood sample (This is central and further broken down)
*   Wearables
*   Etc.

**Blood sample breakdown:**
*   Plasma
*   PBMCs
*   iPSCs
*   Etc.
*   An arrow points from these components downwards to "Biobank".

**Output Applications (right side):**

*   **Diagnostics**
    *   Redefine ~every disease, quantitatively
*   **Drug discovery**
    *   Longitudinal omics at scale to unravel causal biology
*   **Clinical trials**
    *   Precision recruitment + stratification
*   **Care delivery**
    *   Next-gen population health

## Slide 4: There are opportunities to commercialize along the way

There are opportunities to commercialize along the way
Building a biobank sustainably is critical to achieving scale

1.  **Collect samples**
    *   In progress @ Phoenix, AZ
    *   Establish sample "acquisition channels" (e.g. clinical partnerships) to collect high-quality samples
2.  **Generate data**
    *   Work with biopharma customers to fund data generation, starting in specific disease areas
3.  **Build AI applications**
    *   Train AI to define & diagnose disease, discover & validate targets, stratify patients, etc.
