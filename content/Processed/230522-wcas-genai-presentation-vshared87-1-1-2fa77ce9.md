## Slide 8: The emergence of Generative AI has suddenly and drastically changed the landscape of Artificial Intelligence

**PRELIMINARY**

**A new paradigm of Artificial Intelligence**

*   **Traditional AI** : Classification, Anomaly Detection, Prediction
*   **Generative AI** : **Generates new content** e.g., text, image, video, code, synthetic data
    *   Foundational models; don't start from scratch
    *   New business use cases (e.g., human style response to digital Q&A, synthetic data to manage privacy concerns, creating artwork for marketing)

**Enabled by several recent breakthroughs**

**"WHY NOW"**

*   Improvements in GPU performance
*   Reduction in compute costs
*   Massive public data availability
*   Creation of new model architecture (Transformers)
*   Growth in AI research funding

**Leading foundation models\* provided by few key players**

**LANGUAGE MODELS**
*   OpenAI
*   Google
*   Meta
*   AI21labs
*   Hugging Face\*

**IMAGE MODELS**
*   OpenAI
*   stability.ai
*   Midjourney

\*recently partnered with Amazon
\*\*”Foundation models” refers to the underlying large AI models that have been general-purpose trained on massive amounts of data and can be adapted to a wide range of customized use cases

## Slide 9: Generative AI is very different from traditional AI

**Traditional AI/ML**

*   Focuses on **solving specific tasks in one domain**
*   Input and output are most often **numbers**
*   Typically requires **lots of data**
*   **Great at math**, poor at reasoning and content generation
*   Generally used to **aid in decision support**:
    *   E.g., demand forecasting, pricing, targeting

**Generative AI**

*   **General-purpose reasoning engines for many domains**
*   Input and output are often **unstructured data**
*   Most advanced models use **less data**
*   **Great at reasoning & content generation**, poor at math
*   Used to **create unstructured content**
    *   E.g., new marketing content, chat-bots, summaries

**Generative AI is enabling mostly new use-cases, combining two can be very powerful**

## Slide 10: Generative AI leverages various types of learning data to create new content

## Slide 14: While GenAI will improve Chatbots, it will also enable a ChatUX layer that customers and employees will use to interact with apps and data

**Chatbot**
Software application that simulates human conversation with external user
*   **User** (icon: person)
*   **Users typically interact with chatbots to address questions or remedy issues**
*   **Chatbot** (icon: chat bubble with person)

**Primary use cases today**
*   **Customer service bot:** Field and resolve customer queries quickly and efficiently; hand conversation over to live rep
*   **Sales bot:** Engage with potential customers and provide product information to convert leads into customers

**Examples**
*   **Seattle Balloon Assistant** (chat interface with "Hi! We're excited to take you on a ballooning adventure. Let's get all your questions answered! Ask away or select a button.")
*   **Verizon Digital Assistant** (chat interface with "Hey there! I'm the Verizon Digital Assistant. Ask me a question! If I can't help, I can connect you with a live chat agent.")
*   **Vanta** (chat interface with "Welcome to Vanta. We're the fast, easy, trusted way to get SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, PCI, and GDPR compliant. How can we help you today?")

**Primary source of conversational interfaces to date**

---

**ChatUX**
Chat overlay where external or internal user engages with internal data or applications from a company
*   **User** (icon: person)
*   **Engage with application via text**
*   **Applications** (icon: grid of squares)

**Example go-forward use cases**
*   **B2B:** Pull information from CRM to draft an email, generate report for specific fields / inputs, add a column to a spreadsheet and perform calculations
*   **B2C:** Customer engages with grocery delivery company to ask what they should have for dinner based on various preferences (e.g., type of cuisine, preparation required, grams of protein, etc.)

**Example** (Smartphone screen showing text commands)
*   "....list contacts we have in Texas"
*   "....add xx@gmail.com to our contact list"
*   "....show me average length of website visit as a bar chart over the LTM"
*   "....draft me an email to our top 10 clients to thank them for their continued business"

**Recent development of conversational interface; go-forward opportunity to add overlay across applications to create additional value for customers and employees**

**PRELIMINARY**

**Table: Challenges with Generative AI Adoption**

| Category                   | Challenges                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| :------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Timing**                 | • Large language models can be time-consuming to train and run; minimized by leveraging third party models (e.g., from OpenAI)                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Integration complexity** | • Capturing full potential benefits involves addressing substantial data / systems integration challenges                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Accuracy / correctness** | • Baseline models (prior to fine-tuning) can present inaccurate or false output                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Training & user proficiency** | • Users are new to engaging with Generative AI, and are unfamiliar with its limitations; users must be trained to get the most out of these new tools                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Quality / refinement**   | • Quality of language / images / output does not always meet requirements for some applications                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Talent availability**    | • Newer capabilities can make it challenging to identify / onboard talent required to manage it                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Data privacy and protection** | • Safeguards need to be put in place to ensure proprietary data is not used to either enrich models or engage with unapproved applications                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Rights / ownership**     | • Ownership rights of created content remain somewhat ambiguous <br> • Unclear liability for harm                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Ethical concerns**       | • GenAI's cost-saving ability may render many jobs obsolete <br> • Rise of deepfakes reduces trust in public figures, news and content                                                                                                                                                                                    |

**Callout Box: While real, these challenges are all addressable and early adopters have an opportunity to establish a competitive advantage by capitalizing on the flywheel between user engagement and data / model performance**

## Slide 44: While security remains a key concern, there are several mitigations firms can deploy to manage risk today

**Table: Mitigations to manage Generative AI risk**

| Category      | Mitigation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| :------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Technology** | **Data privacy and compliance:** Ensure training data for GenAI model is secured and anonymized, and in compliance with regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA). Sensitive data should be stored separately and access to it should be controlled, with regular audits to ensure compliance <br> **Testing and monitoring:** Regularly test GenAI model for vulnerabilities, ensuring it is protected against attacks. Monitor model and output to detect any suspicious activity or anomalies <br> **Access control:** Access to GenAI model and its training data should be restricted to authorized personnel only. Implement a strong authentication and authorization process to ensure that only authorized personnel can access the model <br> **Regular updates:** Regularly update GenAI model to fix any vulnerabilities and to keep it up-to-date with the latest security standards |
| **Personnel**  | **Training and awareness:** Train employees on importance of data privacy and security, to create awareness of best practices specifically for GenAI. Establish culture of security to ensure that everyone is responsible for maintaining security of the GenAI model <br> **3rd party vendors:** If using third-party vendors for any part of GenAI process, ensure those vendors also follow the same security measures and comply with all relevant regulations                                                                                                                                                                                          |

## Slide 56: Speed and breadth of commercial GenAI adoption will depend largely on regulatory environment and investment

**Bull case for GenAI**

*   Big Tech (e.g., Google, Microsoft) thoroughly embeds GenAI in its workflows and suites
*   Proliferation of GenAI-driven companies
*   Businesses allocate significant resources to GenAI
*   AI continues to become less expensive, as architectures and training techniques advance and processing costs decline
*   Regulatory clarity increases
*   Global GDP growth accelerates
*   LLMs continue to train on internet data

**Bear case for GenAI**

*   Regulation slows development (e.g., recent ban in Italy) and / or hinders GenAI development; potential drivers include:
    *   AI-driven real-world event (e.g., industrial accident)
    *   AI-driven online event (e.g., AI-generated "deep fake")
    *   Ecological concerns due to high amount of compute required
    *   Social concerns due to wide-spread elimination of jobs
*   Extended legal battles regarding IP limit training data sets, slowing or reversing model development
*   GenAI is difficult to safely integrate with workflows, making implementation challenging and limiting GenAI application
*   Cost of GenAI remains relatively high

## Slide 57: Emerging pockets of “arms dealers” / horizontal ecosystem are emerging

**Cloud CAPEX had grown at 20-40% p.a., generally following CSP revenue growth. Near-term outlook suppressed by macro environment. Long-term growth of model scale outweighs efficiency gains.**

## Slide 58: The foundational model landscape could unfold in a variety of ways, but likely to have more than one large model going forward

**More likely end-state zone** (horizontal bar across the middle of the graphic)

| Scenario | (i) Single, leading provider of Internet-scale foundation model | (ii) Two leading foundational model providers | (iii) Few horse race within heavyweight CSPs (2-3 foundation model providers per modality) | (iv) Cambrian explosion continues (limited consolidation/ emergence of hyper-specific domain upstarts) |
| :------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|          | Multi-model models outperform and continue to improve with more data | Network effects for first movers to commercialize | R&D costs prohibitively high outside of CSPs | Unique models for each mode & use case prove most cost-effective |
|          | Broad out-of-box effectiveness | Severe talent, research concentration towards the 2 leading winners | Unique models for each mode prove to be the most cost-effective | General model improvement slows-down (more data stops improving performance; specificity does) |
|          | Higher stickiness than typical SW | Relentless efforts to disrupt/defend Search & Productivity strongholds | CSPs continue major investment in AI tools & services across the stack – competing aggressively for 1st party & 3rd party workloads for cloud infra | Open source “good enough” models lower barrier to entry |
|          | **Talent/research concentration** | | | |
|          | **Compute scale** | | | |
|          | **Data inertia** | | | |
|          | **End-to-end platform** | | | |
|          | | **Too early to tell... but dynamics point to a multi-CSP future with heavy focus on open source, data portability and select best-of-breed point solutions** | | **Open-source gravity** <br> **Multi-cloud bias** <br> **Domain-specific data** <br> **Best-of-breed preference** |

**Traditional AI/ML**
* Focuses on **solving specific tasks in one domain**
* Input and output are most often **numbers**
* Typically requires **lots of data**
* **Great at math**, poor at reasoning and content generation
* Generally used to aid in **decision support**:
 - E.g., demand forecasting, pricing, targeting

**Generative AI**
* **General-purpose reasoning engines for many domains**
* Input and output are often **unstructured data**
* Most advanced models use **less data**
* **Great at reasoning & content generation**, poor at math
* Used to create **unstructured content**
 - E.g., new marketing content, chat-bots, summaries

**Generative AI is enabling mostly new use-cases, combining two can be very powerful**
