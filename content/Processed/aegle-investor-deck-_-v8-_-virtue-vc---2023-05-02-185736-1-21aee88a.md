## Slide 9: Risk Financing

# Risk Financing

## Overview

Substitute stop-loss premium with purpose-built unsecured credit instrument

*   **Predictable, Budgetable Spend.** No matter the underlying plan design, employer health spend will never exceed budget on a cash basis. Credit neutralizes the impact of claims volatility irrespective of source.
*   **Cost Savings.** decrease fixed costs by reducing stop-loss premium, remain equivalently protected by credit.
*   **Flexible.** Risk financing can be applied to safely increase individual specific deductibles, address individual lasers, and as a carrier-agnostic equivalent to 100% accommodating aggregate.

---

## Ideal Fit and Strategy

**Employers (>200 employees) with Finance involvement, interest in outside-the-box solutions, and solid financials**

*   Must have basic familiarity in cashflow management and be able to open an unsecured line of credit

**There will still be a stop loss policy in-place, and the CCSP will continue to complete the procurement process with our preferred stop loss carriers, but the specific deductible will be increased and/or additional lasers will be included. Retained liability will be assumed by the employer, but will be effectively "neutralized" by the lower-cost credit instrument provided by our preferred vendor**

*   CCSP can complete premium/risk analysis for assumed retained risk based on historical claims and Monte Carlo projections
*   Our preferred vendor will provide a quote using the same data used for purchasing stop loss and request familiar financial data normally used to secure lines of credit. To activate the policy, the employer will sign a credit and subscription agreement, and exchange bank account wiring information.

## Slide 10: Risk Financing Structure

# Risk Financing Structure

# OVERVIEW OF RISK FINANCING

Example marketing material from Lockton

This slide presents three bar charts comparing different financing structures over a year (JFMAMJJASOND).

### Pay As You Go
*Somewhat capital efficient, not predictable*
*   A bar chart showing highly variable "Actual Claims" (blue bars) month-to-month.

### LOCKBOX
*Predictable but not capital efficient*
*   A bar chart showing stable "Lockbox Contribution" (orange line) over time, with "Actual Claims" (blue bars) varying but generally lower than the contribution, implying a surplus or buffer.

### RISK FINANCING
*Predictable, capital efficient, 15%+ savings*
*   A bar chart showing "Credit" (grey bars), "Spend" (orange line), and "Actual Claims" (blue bars). The "Spend" line appears more stable and lower than "Actual Claims" in some months due to the application of "Credit."

## Slide 11: Case Study

# Case Study: $370k savings, 243ee group, $120k spec

With Aegle: spend only up to pre-set budget and achieve $370k cost savings (41%) versus existing stop-loss

---

## TODAY: WASTED STOP-LOSS SPEND

This stacked bar chart shows monthly spend components from January 2021 (J21) to November 2022 (N22).
*   **Components:** Group Spend (orange), Stop-Loss (blue)
*   **Total represented:** $898K

The Stop-Loss component (blue) appears consistently present each month, even when Group Spend (orange) is low, indicating "wasted" spend as it's a fixed premium.

---

## AEGLE: 40%+ COST SAVINGS, PREDICTABLE SPEND

This stacked bar chart shows monthly spend components with Aegle from January 2021 (J21) to November 2022 (N22).
*   **Components:** Credit (light orange), Group Spend (orange), Interest (light blue), Fixed (dark blue)
*   **Budget:** A horizontal line indicating a fixed budget.

Here, the total spend (Credit + Group Spend + Interest + Fixed) closely adheres to or stays below the "Budget" line. The "Credit" component fluctuates, implying it's used to smooth out variations in Group Spend to stay within budget, demonstrating predictability and potential savings. The Fixed component is much smaller and less variable than the 'Stop-Loss' from the 'TODAY' chart.

---

**Aegle cost assumptions:** $4 PEPM subscription fee, 14.5% interest on drawn, $250k annual high-attachment stop-loss premium
