## Slide 2: Ataraxis is unique among AI-focused precision medicine companies

**Ataraxis is unique among AI-focused precision medicine companies**

*   Billions of dollars are spent every year on precision oncology, with little impact.
*   Most companies culture tumor specimens, test drug sensitivity – slow, costly, inadequate.
*   Most AI-based companies use single dimensional patient data platforms, predictive value highly limited.
*   Ataraxis proprietary AI integrates complex patient digital data across multiple information platforms to achieve superior predictive capability for cancer recurrence, treatment response.
