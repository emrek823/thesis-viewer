| No. | Reference | Vendor Question | Answer |
|-----|-----------|----------------|--------|
| 1.  | eVP RFP   | The online RFP seemed to show two Addenda but we were not able to access those. Has any Addendum been added yet to the RFP? If so, where and how can we access it/them? | The Plan has not released any addenda other than this addendum. |
| 2.  | eVP 2.5, PROPOSAL QUESTIONS, page 7 | The RFP states “Questions received prior to the submission deadline date in Section 2.4 RFP Schedule, the Plan’s response, and any additional terms deemed necessary by the State will be posted in the form of an Addendum to the electronic Vendor Portal, https://evp.nc.gov, and shall become an Addendum to this RFP.” There are 2 addenda posted on the eVP with a message stating “This solicitation has been modified in Ariba and posted as an addendum. Please log in to Ariba and review for any updates.” Will the addenda be posted on the eVP? | The Plan has not released any addenda other than this addendum. |
| 3.  | General   | Will any 3rd party consultants require access to the platform? If yes, please provide the names and number of licenses required. | At this time, the Plan does not know whether a third-party consultant will need access to the platform. Any cost related to access and/or licensing should be included in the cost proposal. |
| 4.  | General   | Will you confirm whether the state has any restrictions regarding the use of offshore resources? | The Plan prefers that Vendors use resources located in the United States. As part of their proposal submission, Vendors must submit Attachment E: Location of Workers Utilized by Vendor, which is included in the posted RFP. As Section 3.5 and Attachment E describe, offshore resources are not prohibited, though use of offshore resources will be evaluated to ensure that any award will be in the best interest of the Plan. |

|-----|-----------|----------------|--------|
| 5.  | General   | What are your top priorities when it comes to managing healthcare spend and member outcomes over the next 12-24 months? | The Plan does not have a specific list of priorities at this time.

Is there an existing solution or vendor you’re looking to supplement or replace? | The Plan has a data warehouse that contains claims and pharmacy data. To date, the Plan has not supplemented this data with clinical information or other data, nor does the Plan currently have the staff with the appropriate expertise to evaluate the data. |
| 10. | General   | Could you share which stakeholders or teams will be using the analytics platform and what their primary roles or goals are? | Plan staff, and possibly the Plan’s actuary, will utilize the data for a variety of purposes including, but not limited to, evaluating the utilization and health of all members to develop new programs and initiatives. |

| 12  | General            | Is there any budget allocated for this contract? If yes, can you please let us know the same? | The Plan has not allocated a specific budget for this project. The bids will be evaluated based on content and cost.                                                                                 |

| 15  | General            | Will the agency allow us to provide replacement personnel with similar or more skill sets? | Vendors will be able to replace resources, as needed, although Section 4.8 requires that the Vendor obtain the prior written approval of the Plan’s Contract Administrator to substitute key personnel. Section 4.8 also provides that the Plan has the right to request new resources if those provided are not satisfactory. |
| 16  | General            | Given the complexity of this RFP, is there a possibility of an extension of 2 weeks for the deadline to allow for more preparation and clarification of certain aspects of the RFP? | The timeline for this RFP will not be extended.                                                                                                                                                        |
| 17  | RFP cover page     | Is the “eVP number” on the cover page the “customer number” in the eVP portal? | Yes, the “eVP number” on the RFP cover page is the “customer number” in the eVP portal.                                                                                                            |
| 18  | Section 1.0 pg. 5  | Who is the incumbent vendor for population health analysis and management?      | The Plan does not currently have an incumbent vendor for population health analysis and management.                                                                                                   |

| 19. | Section 1.0, Page 5            | Is there an incumbent?                                                          | The Plan does not currently have an incumbent vendor for population health analysis and management. |
| 20. | Section 1.0 Page 5             | Is there an incumbent on the contract? If yes, could you please let us know the incumbent name and spending done on contract so far? | The Plan does not currently have an incumbent vendor for population health analysis and management. |
| 21. | Section 1.0 -- Purpose, Page 5 | What types of insights and reports are most valuable to the Plan’s leadership, Board, and stakeholders? (e.g., executive dashboards, risk stratification models, detailed provider scorecards) Can you provide examples of past reports, dashboards, or insights currently delivered to the Board, Treasurer, or stakeholders? | The Plan is interested in seeing what the vendor has to offer and will not be providing samples. |
| 22. | Section 1.0 -- Purpose, Page 5 | Will the Plan require regular reporting on predefined KPIs or support for ad hoc strategic analyses? | The Plan would like predefined KPI reporting and support for ad hoc analysis. |
| 23. | Section 1.0 -- Purpose, Page 5 | Are there particular quality or performance metrics currently used to evaluate population health outcomes and provider impact? (e.g., HEDIS, Star Ratings, Plan-defined benchmarks) | The Plan does want these types of reports but also needs the ability to develop its own reports using vendor tools. |
| 24. | Section 1.0 – Background       | The reduction in total NCSHP members of 740,000 to the focused population of 572,000 members seems to be related to the funding mechanism (i.e. self-funded vs fully insured). Is that the determining factor between these two populations? If so, if the selected Vendor can ingest fully insured data (e.g. claims, eligibility, demographics, etc.), would NCSHP consider expanding the focused population to include all 740,000 members? | The Plan is focused on its self-funded members. The fully insured members are managed by the Plan’s Medicare Advantage vendor. There is no need for the Data Aggregation Services Vendor to ingest that data. |
| 25. | Section 1.0 Purpose and Background, Background State Health Plan, Page 5 | The section states that there are 740,000 eligible lives, the services herein are focused on 572,000 plan members. Can the State verify the delta in eligible lives and plan members may be because only 572,000 of those eligible are participating in? | This Contract is focused on the self-insured members. There are currently approximately 572,000 self-funded members. This includes both subscribers and dependents. |

Any insight that can be shared with regard to the assistance NCSHP will provide assuring timely data provision from the data sources (e.g. TPA, PBM, etc.) will be helpful. | The Plan intends to kick off the implementation Monday, June 2. The intent is to complete the Business Requirements Document (“BRD”) for the claims and enrollment history that first week. Once that is finalized the data can be provided within a couple of weeks. The BRDs for the ongoing vendor data will be developed and finalized by the end of June. The Vendor will have to set up file transfers with Plan vendors to receive ongoing data. |
| 34  | Section 2.4, Page 6                  | Could there be an extension to Deadline for Submission of Proposals from May 2nd to May 9th? | There will not be any extensions.                                                                |
| 35  | Section 2.4, page 7                   | Can the Plan confirm if the data files for each Plan vendor could be delivered to the awarded Vendor no later than 6/30/25 for a 9/1/25 Go Live date? | As long as the Vendor is able to finalize the historical data BRDs with the Plan during the first week of June, historical data will be provided by the end of June 2025. |
| 36  | Section 2.4 pg. 7                     | Is there opportunity for a system demo before contract award? If so, where does this fall in the timeline? | There will not be a system demonstration.                                                        |
| 37  | 2.4, RFP SCHEDULE, page 7            | The RFP schedule lists Services Begin on September 1, 2026 – please confirm that the year is correct. | Services will begin on September 1, 2025. This Addendum includes an amendment correcting the schedule as listed in the RFP. |
| 38  | 2.4, RFP SCHEDULE, page 7            | Will the state consider granting an extension for the proposal deadline?       | There will not be an extension.                                                                  |

| 39. | Section 2.6, pages 7 &#x26; 8     | Acknowledging that we are prohibited from submitting via USPS and that vendors must use a different parcel or package delivery service, please confirm if hand-delivery by the proposing entity will be accepted. | As stated in the question and as the RFP notes, Vendors are prohibited from using the USPS to submit their bids because the USPS does not deliver directly to the Plan’s office address. Vendors are permitted to hand-deliver their bids to the Plan’s office address. |
| 40. | 2.6 Proposal Submittal sub-section a) | Can the State confirm that the submission should include 11 total copies of the proposal – each in its own binder? | There should be two signed, original executed technical and cost proposals and nine copies of the technical and cost proposals, for a total of eleven unredacted versions of the technical and cost proposal. The technical and cost proposals should be in separate binders, each binder no more than 3”. If Vendors desire to submit redacted versions of the proposals for the Plan to use in response to public records requests, Section 2.6 requires Vendors to submit an additional physical copy and an electronic copy of the technical and cost proposals with redactions. |
| 41. | 2.6 Proposal Submittal sub-section a) | Can the State clarify – will each hard copy submission need to be in its own sealed package? Or, can all copies of the Technical Proposal be in one package, and all copies of the Cost Proposal be in another package? | Each hard copy submission does not need to be in its own sealed package. All copies of the Technical Proposal can be in one package, and all copies of the Cost Proposal can be in another package. Flash drives must be clearly marked and in a separate envelope, but that envelope containing the flash drives may be included with either the Technical Proposal or Cost Proposal. |

| 50. | Section 4.4 HUB Participation  | Can the State please clarify what this section means, or what is required?   | This section has been marked “reserved” because it is not being used in this procurement. Therefore, nothing is required related to this section. |

|-----|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
|     | Vendor Technical Proposal      | should be addressed in our response. However, there doesn't appear to be any specific criteria or guidance provided on this response, and the questions in the Technical Response section are primarily formatted as “CONFIRM” or “DOES NOT CONFIRM.” Could you please confirm whether you are also expecting a narrative response that addresses the Minimum Requirements separately from the Technical Response section? |                                          |
|     |                                | If the Minimum Requirement only asks the Vendor to confirm a response, then “confirmed” or “not confirmed” is all that is needed. If, however, the requirement asks the Vendor for a description, then that is what the vendor should provide. Minimum Requirement number 1, for example, asks for a description. Some Minimum Requirements, such as Minimum Requirement number 4, asks the Vendor to confirm and provide; therefore, that is what the Vendor should do. |                                          |
