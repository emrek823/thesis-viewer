When you talk to our primary care providers, they will tell you it takes a skilled professional to dig through charts to complete a prior authorization. Latent’s real superpower is taking on that heavy lifting behind the scenes, so our top clinical talent can stay focused on what truly matters: caring for patients.”

Every January, we had to reauthorize thousands of patients—a process that used to stretch until mid-March. With Latent, we’ve cut that time by 50% and now finish within the same month."

Before Latent, the manual PA process could significantly delay therapy initiation. Now, we’re accelerating time-to-therapy and ensuring patients can start their medications as soon as possible.”
