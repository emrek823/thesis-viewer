### TriBridge Background & Current Status

- TriBridge temporarily on back burner after Visa backing fell through
	- Change outage made industry skittish about revenue flows
	- Visa leadership change brought more conservative approach
	- Combined factors killed Visa interest
- Matt now leads stablecoins for Visa
- Problem has gotten more acute since, no movement toward solutions

### Key Market Insights & Learnings

- Provider financing landscape changed:
	- Providers could get very cheap AR pre-funding from financial institutions
	- 1-2% float to play with (material for large health systems)
	- Reduced traditional 3-4% interest rate advantage
- Blue Cross network dynamics:
	- Three key Blue Cross plans set tone for entire system: Horizon, Michigan, Florida Blue
	- Getting these opens rest of Blues network
	- Opposite also true - other wins don’t carry over effectively
	- Blues association wasn’t helpful for scaling
- Geographic market assessment:
	- Pacific Northwest identified as optimal region
	- Multiple Blues plans, Kaiser presence, fragmented provider market
	- 70% coverage achievable with 2-3 players each side
	- Chicago too fragmented on provider side despite good payer concentration
- Network infrastructure improvements:
	- FedNow/RTP network gained material scale since TriBridge
	- 70% coverage for bank accounts (up from 30%)
	- Wire vs RTP payment timing: 24-48 hours difference
	- Provides additional rails for real-time payments

### Ongoing Opportunity Assessment

- Core problem remains unsolved:
	- ERAs and EFTs still don’t reconcile properly
	- Manual reconciliation still happening in health system basements
	- Two standards that don’t talk to each other
- AI integration potential for long-tail provider deployment
- Market validation from multiple angles:
	- Ramp successfully selling direct to healthcare providers
	- Welsh Carson portfolio companies using Ramp effectively
	- Stedi raised significant funding but stuck serving RCM vendors
- Emre considering incubation approach with General Catalyst backing
