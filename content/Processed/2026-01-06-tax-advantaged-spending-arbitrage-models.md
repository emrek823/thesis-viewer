# The $200B Tax-Advantaged Spending Arbitrage: TrueMed Is Just the Beginning

**Lead take:** TrueMed ($34M Series A, a16z/Bessemer) proved the model: unlock $159B in HSA assets for wellness spend via Letters of Medical Necessity. But this is one play in a much larger arbitrage landscape. The real opportunity is **expanding the definition of "medical necessity"** across multiple categories—fitness, food, sleep, mental health, GLP-1 companions—while legislative tailwinds (Big Beautiful Bill) legitimize what was previously gray-area spending. The next TrueMed will either (1) go deeper on food/grocery (the holy grail), (2) bundle with GLP-1 prescriptions, or (3) aggregate employer LSA + HSA into unified wellness wallets.

## The Core Arbitrage: Tax-Advantaged Dollars Want to Be Spent on Wellness

### The Numbers

| Account Type | Annual Limit | Tax Treatment | Total Assets/Market |
|--------------|--------------|---------------|---------------------|
| HSA | $4,300 / $8,550 family | Triple tax-free | **$159B** (40M accounts) |
| FSA | $3,200 | Pre-tax (use-it-or-lose-it) | ~$30B annual spend |
| Employer LSA | Avg $1,029/employee | Post-tax (employer-funded) | Growing rapidly |
| Dependent Care FSA | $5,000 | Pre-tax | ~$6B annual |
| Commuter Benefits | $325/month each | Pre-tax | ~$4B annual |

**Total addressable pool: $200B+**

### The Problem

People WANT to spend on wellness (gyms, supplements, sleep tech, healthy food). The IRS says NO unless it's "medical." The gap between what people want and what's eligible = arbitrage opportunity.

### The Loophole

**Letter of Medical Necessity (LMN):** A licensed provider certifies that a purchase is "medically necessary" to treat a diagnosed condition. This converts discretionary wellness spend into tax-deductible medical expense.

**76% of Americans have at least one chronic condition.** Almost everyone qualifies for something.

---

## Model 1: TrueMed (The Proof of Concept)

### What They Do

[TrueMed](https://www.truemed.com/blog/truemed-series-a-announcement) issues LMNs via telehealth to unlock HSA/FSA for wellness purchases.

### Metrics

- **Funding:** $34M Series A (Dec 2025) led by Andreessen Horowitz + Bessemer
- **Merchants:** 3,000+ (Peloton, Eight Sleep, Nike Strength, 24 Hour Fitness, Barry's, SoulCycle)
- **Revenue growth:** 3x YoY for past 2 years
- **Consumer proposition:** ~30% savings via pre-tax dollars
- **LMN fee:** $30/year covers 12 months of fitness expenses

### Business Model

1. Consumer pays $30 for LMN evaluation
2. If approved, can purchase from partner merchants with HSA/FSA
3. TrueMed takes revenue share from merchants (likely 3-8%)
4. Partnership with Navia Benefit Solutions for benefits ecosystem distribution

### Why It Works

- 76% of Americans have chronic conditions = massive LMN-eligible population
- Merchants get access to $159B in otherwise inaccessible demand
- Consumers save 30% (marginal tax rate) on purchases they'd make anyway
- Telehealth LMN is low-friction ($30, no doctor visit)

### Competitive Moat

- 3,000+ merchant relationships
- Clinician network for LMN issuance
- Compliance infrastructure (IRS audit defensibility)
- a16z/Bessemer backing = capital for land grab

## Model 2: The Food/Grocery Arbitrage (Holy Grail)

### Why This Is the Big One

Everyone buys food. If food becomes HSA-eligible, TAM explodes.

### Current Rules

Per [IRS FAQ](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/frequently-asked-questions-about-medical-expenses-related-to-nutrition-wellness-and-general-health):
> Food or beverages are eligible but only if (1) the food doesn't satisfy normal nutritional needs, (2) it alleviates or treats an illness, and (3) the need is substantiated by a physician.

Translation: Regular groceries = NO. Specialty medical food = YES (incremental cost only).

### Exploitable Angles

**1. Medical Nutrition Therapy (MNT)**
- Dietitian-prescribed meal plans for specific conditions
- Diabetes, celiac, PKU, renal disease = clearly eligible
- The "incremental cost" rule: if gluten-free bread costs $2 more than regular bread, that $2 is eligible

**2. GLP-1 Prescribed Diets**
- GLP-1 users need high-protein, low-calorie diets to preserve muscle mass
- Could a provider prescribe specific foods as "medically necessary" for GLP-1 therapy?
- Protein supplements already TrueMed-eligible

**3. Therapeutic Food Delivery**
- Medically-tailored meals for chronic conditions
- Companies like Mom's Meals (Medicaid) could pivot to HSA
- The "hospital food at home" framing

**4. Functional Food as Medicine**
- Emerging category: food formulated for specific health outcomes
- Requires LMN + "doesn't satisfy normal nutritional needs" argument
- Gray area, but TrueMed has expanded what's possible

### The Startup Opportunity

**"TrueMed for Food"** — LMN-based platform enabling HSA/FSA for medically-prescribed groceries/meal kits.

Challenges:
- IRS rules are strict ("doesn't satisfy normal nutritional needs")
- Audit risk is higher than gym memberships
- Need strong clinical evidence base

But if someone cracks this, it's 10x TrueMed's TAM.

## Model 3: GLP-1 Companion Stack

### The Thesis

GLP-1 users (1 in 8 US adults) need companion products to maximize outcomes:
- Protein supplements (muscle preservation)
- Gym memberships (resistance training)
- Body composition tracking (DEXA, smart scales)
- High-protein meal delivery
- Adherence apps

**All of these can be argued as "medically necessary" for GLP-1 therapy.**

### The Model

Bundle GLP-1 prescription (via telehealth) + HSA-funded companion products:
1. Prescribe GLP-1 via telehealth ($200-450/month)
2. Issue LMN for companion products as part of treatment plan
3. Patient uses HSA/FSA for gym, protein, tracking devices
4. Platform takes margin on both drug and companions

### Why This Works

- GLP-1 creates medical necessity for previously discretionary spend
- The prescribing provider controls the LMN
- Companion products improve outcomes (which improves adherence/retention)
- High-ticket stack: drug + gym + protein + tracking = $500+/month

### Who Could Build This

- Hims/Hers (already doing GLP-1 + building full-stack)
- Noom (GLP-1 Companion + behavioral platform)
- New entrant bundling telehealth + TrueMed-style LMN + merchant network

## Model 4: Sleep/Recovery Tech Integration

### HSA-Eligible Sleep Products (with LMN)

| Product | Price | Condition |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| Eight Sleep Pod | $2,500+ | Insomnia, sleep apnea, chronic pain |
| Oura Ring | $300+ | Sleep disorders, HRV monitoring |
| Whoop | $30/month | Recovery optimization for athletes |
| Cold Plunge | $5,000+ | Chronic inflammation, pain management |
| Sauna | $3,000+ | Cardiovascular, chronic pain |
| Red Light Therapy | $500+ | SAD, chronic pain, skin conditions |

Eight Sleep and others are already TrueMed partners.

### The Opportunity

**Vertical-specific LMN platforms** for high-ticket wellness categories:
- "Sleep Health HSA" — LMN + curated sleep tech merchants
- "Recovery HSA" — LMN + cold plunge, sauna, red light
- "Mental Wellness HSA" — LMN + meditation apps, float tanks, breathwork

---

## Model 5: Employer LSA + HSA Unification

### The Fragmentation Problem

Employees have multiple benefit accounts:
- HSA (medical)
- FSA (medical, use-it-or-lose-it)
- LSA (wellness stipend, post-tax)
- Commuter benefits
- Dependent care FSA

Each has different rules, different cards, different portals. Nobody optimizes.

### The Opportunity

**Unified wellness wallet** that:
1. Aggregates all benefit accounts
2. Automatically routes purchases to optimal account (HSA if eligible, LSA if not)
3. Generates LMNs dynamically for borderline purchases
4. Maximizes tax savings across all pools

### Players to Watch

- **Forma** — Already doing LSA for Microsoft, could add HSA
- **Benepass** — Multi-benefit platform
- **Lively** — HSA + LSA integration
- **Compt** — LSA leader (average $1,029/employee)

---

## Model 6: Dependent Care Arbitrage (Underexploited)

### The Pool

$5,000/year pre-tax for childcare (Dependent Care FSA).

### Current Use

- Daycare, nanny, preschool, summer camp
- Au pair programs (room/board portion)
- Before/after school care

### Arbitrage Angles

**1. "Educational" Childcare**
- Coding camps, language immersion, STEM programs
- If it's childcare during work hours, it's eligible

**2. Backup Care Platforms**
- Care.com-style marketplaces optimized for DCFSA
- Employer-subsidized backup care (50% employer, 50% DCFSA)

**3. Nanny Share Optimization**
- Pool DCFSA across families
- Reduce per-family cost while maximizing benefit use

Less sexy than HSA, but $5K/year is real money.

---

## Model 7: The Legislative Arbitrage (Big Beautiful Bill)

### What Changed

The **One Big Beautiful Bill Act** (July 2025) made fitness expenses explicitly HSA-eligible:
- Gym memberships (not private clubs)
- Group fitness classes
- **Cap:** $500/individual, $1,000/family per year
- **Effective:** Distributions after Dec 31, 2025

### Implications

**1. TrueMed's LMN business partially commoditized**
- For fitness up to $500, you don't need an LMN anymore
- Above $500, you still need medical necessity

**2. But...**
- $500 cap is low (one year of gym membership)
- Personal training NOT included
- Virtual fitness NOT included (unless live)
- This creates continued demand for LMN-based expansion

**3. The Real Signal**
- Congress is expanding HSA eligibility
- More categories will follow
- Position for the next expansion (food? mental health? sleep?)

## Investment Thesis: Where to Play

### Tier 1: Proven Models (Growth Stage)

| Company | Model | Stage | Why Interesting |
|---------|-------|-------|-----------------|
| **TrueMed** | LMN for wellness | Series A ($34M) | a16z/Bessemer validated, 3x growth |
| **Forma** | LSA platform | Growth | Microsoft customer, multi-benefit |
| **Lively** | HSA + investing | Late | $200M+ AUM, expanding to LSA |

### Tier 2: Adjacent Opportunities (Seed/Series A)

| Opportunity | Model | Why Now |
|-------------|-------|---------|
| **GLP-1 + HSA bundle** | Telehealth + LMN + merchant stack | GLP-1 creates medical necessity |
| **Food/grocery LMN** | TrueMed for medically-prescribed food | Holy grail if regulations bend |
| **Unified wellness wallet** | Aggregate HSA + FSA + LSA | Fragmentation pain point |
| **Sleep/recovery vertical** | LMN + high-ticket wellness | Eight Sleep $2,500 = big AOV |

### Tier 3: Watch/Wait

| Opportunity | Why Wait |
|-------------|----------|
| Pure-play HSA admin | Consolidating, HealthEquity dominates |
| Commuter benefits | Small TAM, limited innovation |
| 529/ABLE arbitrage | Regulatory risk, niche |

## Bull/Bear Cases

### Bull Case (Tax-advantaged wellness explodes)

- TrueMed hits $100M+ GMV, IPO or strategic exit
- Congress expands HSA eligibility further (food, mental health)
- Employers consolidate benefit accounts into unified wallets
- GLP-1 companion market reaches $10B+
- "Medical necessity" interpretation broadens under RFK Jr. HHS

### Bear Case (Arbitrage closes)

- IRS cracks down on LMN mills (audit enforcement)
- TrueMed-style models face legal challenges
- Big Beautiful Bill caps ($500) limit upside
- HealthEquity acquires TrueMed, commoditizes
- Employers don't adopt unified benefit platforms

**Queries for Exa/research:**
- "HSA FSA food grocery startup 2025 2026"
- "GLP-1 companion products HSA eligible"
- "Letter of Medical Necessity telehealth platform startup"
- "employer wellness wallet benefits aggregation"
- "medically-tailored meals HSA FSA"

**People to talk to:**
- TrueMed customers (merchants and consumers)
- Benefits consultants at Mercer, WTW
- Telehealth providers doing LMN at scale
- GLP-1 telehealth founders (Hims, Ro, Calibrate)
- IRS/tax specialists on HSA eligibility

## Key Insight

The regulatory environment is **loosening, not tightening**. The Big Beautiful Bill expanded fitness eligibility. RFK Jr. at HHS favors "food as medicine." The trend is toward broader definitions of medical necessity.

**The play:** Position for the next expansion. The startup that can:
1. Build merchant relationships in emerging categories (food, sleep, mental health)
2. Develop compliant LMN infrastructure at scale
3. Create defensible distribution (employer benefits, telehealth integration)

...captures the next wave of tax-advantaged spending unlock.
