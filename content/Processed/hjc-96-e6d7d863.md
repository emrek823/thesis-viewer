Head of clinical

Ryan Gallagher - 3 or 4 convos, interview exercise

Is he down to be another co-founding executive or not?

Psychiatrist - leaning too much towards current vs. new HJC model. Balancing these things is difficult. Can psych do that?

3 ideas

Can’t pay - full stop

People come to the free session

Loss for acquisition

Demoralizing for the group

160 groups → 9 folks full time

How do we build that pipeline

Sticky

Payment flow - moved in-house. People will leave our program

Operational overhead off our plates - Intercom, change payment, group them. Doing that stuff by hand today. Build this into the product to make this streamlined

“Friends as a service” or camp counselor

User research

She does all the moderation and has friendships with people

She could not get moved along with therapists. She would be DM’ing this mental health advocate out of sessions. She transported a 40-pg conversation with her friends and annotated the discussion and gave her thoughts.

Contextualized

Deepen community
