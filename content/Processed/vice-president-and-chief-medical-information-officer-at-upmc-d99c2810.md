# Abridge - Vice President and Chief Medical Information Officer at UPMC Pinnacle

**Interview conducted on January 12, 2024**

## Topics
User Distribution, Integration, ROI Measurement, Auditability, Digital Health, Innovation, EMR, Speech Recognition

## Summary
During the conversation, the Vice President and Chief Medical Information Officer at UPMC Pinnacle discusses their experience with Abridge and Nuance as vendors for their electronic medical record systems. The majority of users at UPMC Pinnacle use Nuance's DAX Express, while a smaller percentage use Abridge. Surgeons and specialties with quick visits find the AI technology less effective compared to templates. Clinician satisfaction with both systems is high. Pricing for the products is based on the number of licenses purchased, with larger customers receiving better discounts. UPMC Pinnacle plans to expand the user base once integration with the mobile Epic Haiku version is complete. The decision to expand to 100% of the user base will depend on the consolidation of their two Epic instances. The VP compares the strengths and weaknesses of Abridge and Nuance, noting that Abridge has stronger auditability and multilingual capabilities. They prioritize actual delivery over promises when evaluating vendors. The VP also emphasizes the importance of price, ROI, workflow, integration, maturity, and continuous evolution in the AI space. The pricing difference between Abridge and Nuance DAX Express is not significant.

## Client
Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today about Abridge. To start off, could you please give us a quick overview of your background and experience in this space?

## Expert
Yes. So I am a CMIO, Chief Medical Information Officer, digital health executive. Been in this space for 15-plus years. And UPMC, there's a large integrated delivery and finance system, almost 40 hospitals and close to 1,000 clinics and housing physicians and providers. We try to be on the front end of innovation in terms of adopting new technologies, creating sort of a path for others to follow in terms of creating road maps for really the industry.

We do have Epic EMR on the ambulatory side. We overall have a couple of EMRs, so we have Epic on the ambulatory side across our clinics. And specifically, we have two Epics and guess we'll get into the details of sort of why we are able to have two different EMRs – or sorry, two different vendors, Abridge and Nuance.

And as you alluded to, we have had Nuance for a while in terms of front-end speech, probably, gosh, like more than a decade. And Abridge is newer. We've used them for other things, but AI specifically, probably for a year now. And that's sort of in the two different EMR spaces, we have two different vendors.

## Client
Yes. So, just help me understand. Two different EMRs, Epic on the ambulatory side, and it's two different versions of Epic you're saying on the nonambulatory side?

## Expert
Yes, two different Epic instances. Just through acquisition, we grew to fully hospitals. So one of the health systems had Epic before they were acquired so we've kept them. They haven't consolidated yet. So that's why through acquisitions, we just have two different Epic instances, and we've been able to manage to get Nuance, DAX Express on one and then Abridge on one. We are one of the first customers of Abridge to do the deep integration with Epic with SDE back last year.

## Client
I see. And then if I just had to think about the mix, let's say, maybe it's a number of endpoints or seats, like is it 50-50 between these two different instances of Epic or what's the mix?

## Expert
You mean for the AI or just in general users?

## Client
Just in general users.

## Expert
Yes. So I would say 70-30. So on Epic, probably has 70% of the users and the other has 30%.

## Client
And then where you have Nuance's DAX Express, is that tied to the 70% or the 30%? And the same question goes for Abridge, just the inverse.

## Expert
Yes. So the 70% has the DAX Express and then the 30% has Abridge. But there are some nonintegrated Abridge users as well across the enterprise.

## Client
I see. And then I mean, any plans to consolidate further? And like any feedback on DAX Express versus Abridge? And I know the pricing is a bit different. From a functionality perspective, maybe you have some commentary.

## Expert
Yes. So that's a loaded multiple question so I'll try to get through each of one of them. If I forget, just remind me. So first feedback, I think from physicians and maybe it's a selection bias. So we have a couple of hundred users on both now. Probably I shouldn't say a couple of hundred but like 100 each, and we're going to expand into a few hundreds for both of them as the year progresses.

But the selection bias has been -- we have been selecting physicians that have been struggling with documentation where M&S is struggling, spending a lot of time in documentation, have a lot of pajama time. So this has been really just our physicians -- many of our physicians have expressed being a game changer. So I've described desktop, their plans for retirement, et cetera. So the initial way, of course, it's those users that really, really needed help.

Now between all this, we also have tried some of the surgeons that are super -- they see a lot of patients in a day and quick in and out. They haven't found it to be as effective if they have templates, really good Epic templates. And if you like that, they can go through their documentation quickly. And they usually stopped using it pretty quickly because they did feel like right now, the workflows are still clunky. It takes more time to use this than just using their templates.

## Client
Yes. And does that apply across both DAX and Abridge, the sort of feedback that surgeons and in-patient is not quite there yet?

## Expert
Surgeons, yes, and sort of those specialties like OB is another one we try. They have quick visits, short visits. And DAX Express maybe a little bit less because DAX Express doesn't have that many hoops to jump through. And DAX Express is also a little more integrated in terms of you can use Haiku Epic native mobile app to have the conversation record versus Abridge is not there yet. They are planning to release that soon enough, in a couple of weeks, maybe a month or so.

So I think Abridge is working to reduce some of that friction. But yes, so one platform, maybe that's one of the distinguishing factors. But we still have -- regardless of that, we still have users that haven't found it as useful, or they only find it useful for their longer visits where there's a new patient, where they're getting a lot of history, et cetera, where it's not a quick follow-up, 10-minute follow-up, they're only asking some very targeted questions. And for those targeted questions, they have really good templates.

They do find this AI technology not to be really helpful enough to use it. And that's also typical for front-end speech. We have pretty good penetration of front-end speech for Nuance or what is called Dragon. Not everybody uses it. For example, I never use it because I feel like I'm a fast typer. And even the people that use it might not necessarily use it for every single patient encounter. They might use it for half or maybe only for the new patients. And I think to your question is something about cost, I forget what you said.

## Client
Yes. So I mean, if I were to summarize so far, the feedback, it seems like DAX Express has a few more workflows and integrations, and you're saying that it has fewer hoops to jump through. Maybe if I could just follow up on that piece. Like if you had to summarize clinician satisfaction on a scale of one to 10 for DAX Express and for Abridge, what would you rank it based on the feedback you've heard from clinicians in your org?

## Expert
Yes. And we're measuring that, but both have been pretty high satisfaction, so eight to nine, and I'm conservative survey. And it's only I'm saying both because the users don't necessarily use both systems. They're two different Epics. They're using two different vendors, so they don't really know what the other vendor looks like.

They just know what's been given to them. And they're usually pretty happy with what they have. Does that make sense? I mean, of course, they might find one over -- clunky over the other, but it doesn't -- they don't necessarily know that, oh, this could be less clunkier.

## Client
Makes sense. And then let's talk about pricing and how you think about cost and ROI. From my knowledge, to be able to use DAX Express, you also need to pay for Dragon, which is pretty expensive. Can you help us understand like, first, like how are these products priced for you? And how do you think about spend within the overall health care IT tech stack?

## Expert
Yes. So some things, of course, I can't share confidentially in terms of the exact pricing and things. I'm sure you can understand that. Number two, our pricing is probably very different than others. And the thing I can share that is because the more licenses you buy, it's license-based, the cheaper it gets. And I think that's like anywhere anything in the world. Like you have more the bigger the customer you are, the better the discounts you get.

Now only if you buy like 10 licenses or even 100 licenses, the price is higher than compared to if you were to buy 2,000 licenses or 5,000 licenses or even enterprise license, then the price goes down significantly. And then, of course, we also have an advantage of being early adopters for both. And then both companies also know that we're comparing each other -- each of them against each other so that helps drive down the price.

Usually, health systems typically don't have the resources, don't have the capacity and don't have two different EMRs, to be very frank, to purchase that. And also, we are one of the largest, if not the largest Microsoft Healthcare customer. And the more you buy -- same thing, more you buy from Microsoft, their prices, you get -- you continue to get steeper discounts. And probably one of the first ones to be bundled like that under Microsoft, so I'm not saying Nuance or DAX Express.

I haven't heard what you just said about you have to Dragon to have DAX Express. We do already have Dragon so maybe that's why I haven't heard that. But I don't believe that's exactly 100% true. Now I do know if you do have that Dragon integration, you can use that to have your DAX Express integration or move that quickly if you didn't have Dragon integration with Epic. Does that make sense? So things are a little bit easier if you already are on Dragon in terms of your IT work to integrate early on.

But it's not impossible to just get DAX Express and do integration. We did that with Abridge. We didn't have integration before. And so I was just going to say one other thing. Before DAX Express, there was DAX, that had the human component on to it. That was quite pricey relative compared to Abridge. Now things are kind of leveling.

And of course, there's competition in the market. I'm sure you know there's like 12, 15 vendors. These two, I think, still are the top two vendors, I think I would rate them as. But of course, they are competing against each other, so the prices are coming down and they're not as different as DAX and Abridge as it used to, let's just say that.

## Client
Yes. Could you help me understand like I know 70% of your org on the one Epic instance is allowed to use DAX, and 30% of your org clinicians are allowed to use Abridge. Do you have a sense of active user base between those two? Like what is the mix? And then yes, maybe that -- let's start with that.

## Expert
Yes, yes. So we have been limiting this for now, so we only have like a few hundred on each, like maybe actually less on Abridge because we have been following that. We were waiting -- and there are several reasons to it. First, we had tried the nonintegrated Abridge, like one of the first ones. And like I said, nonintegrated Abridge can be used by anyone in the organization, even by the 70% users.

So there's no like there's no -- nobody is blocked from using that. It's not like 70% users can only access DAX Express, but they can only get DAX Express with their Epic if they wanted to use the integrated one. Because we had tried a nonintegrated approach with Epic -- I mean, sorry, Abridge first.

And we had that experience, we want our users to use the integrated version. And we're really swaddling it to wait until it gets integrated with the mobile Epic Haiku version that's coming out here pretty shortly. So we have on purpose not added, but I would assume once that's available, we would have a few more hundred users.

I mean, we have licenses for a few thousand on both sides. But we want to do this in a step-by-step approach, train physicians, train the end users and the workflow because it's not as simple as we turn it on here, you go anybody can have it. It's what you really have to do.

It's a change management project, takes resources, takes time for it to be really successful. And we're measuring it, to your point, ROI earlier, we're really measuring it very closely all these factors. So we need -- it's a very closely tracked project. We need to know when somebody is onboarding and how they're using it and so on and so forth. So we can -- we have ways for that.

## Client
So you said like you're waiting for Epic or for Abridge to launch a mobile integrated version?

## Expert
Yes.

## Client
Would doing so then enable Abridge to expand to 100% of the user base? Or do you think that it'll it will still be constrained to 30% for a bit?

## Expert
For a bit until we do have plans for -- to consolidate our two Epics into one. So perhaps at that point, we will decide between one of the vendors.

## Client
I wanted to ask a couple of questions here. One is in terms of as you think about the new entrants, Abridge and Nuance, Nuance, I imagine you have a multiyear contract. Is that the same with Abridge as well?

## Expert
Yes, yes, without getting into too many details there.

## Client
Got it, got it. But in this like multiyear arrangement, it's generally -- we can assume that there is like a phased approach to try and to get them to the whole organization if they do well. Do you usually do that by like milestones for them to hit in order for them to kind of earn the right to expand? Or is this something more time-based?

## Expert
A little bit of both. So time-based as well as milestones and the ROI that we continue to measure and follow. And like I said, like neither of those vendors have the full -- we have close to 6,000 providers' contract to expand across, and that's on purpose. I mean, it wouldn't make sense to give both -- it wouldn't make sense for 6,000 to have contracts for 6,000 providers with both. You wouldn't want to double pay to vendors.

## Client
Got it. And, in terms of we can get a lot of insight from other customers but one thing that is different to you, you spend a lot of time using Nuance. You also know the management team at Abridge. Could you just help provide some color on the teams? How effective are they? How fast do they move? Just any additional kind of perspective on primarily on the management team driving both of these products.

## Expert
Yes. That's an interesting question. And I think some of it is like you sort of have to know where they're coming from. Microsoft is a well-run $2 trillion huge multinational corporation versus you're comparing a startup. So they -- one has deep experience, knows how to support health care clients. Nuance got bought by Microsoft, but Nuance has been in this business and knows how to support physicians and Epic. I mean, the customers in general. They've been doing this for a while.

I know some of their CMIOs pretty well too, and colleagues, physician leaders that have been there for quite some time versus Abridge. Strong leadership team but still start-up and growing pains, as you can imagine, at any start-up and really sort of having that customer solutions support that any growing company would have.

And then also on the flip side of things, to be fair, we were, as I mentioned, I don't know if you had joined the call by then, we were the first ones to have the deep integration with Abridge for any Epic customer in the world. So that hat is on growing pains as well as nobody had done it. You're sort of charting that path. I'm sure things got easier for other customers. After all, all lessons learned.

But is that -- I don't just look at leadership sort of strength, I think that's what you asked, but more of an overall company and overall organizational sort of structure and support that they provide to customers. That makes any sense. Because you could have a strong leader but you might not have as full deep management to support a large a pretty large organization like ours.

I guess, yes, I should frame it that way to you. We're pretty large with our very, very diverse and very unique needs and a high level of expectation from our vendors as well. Now on the flip side, if you're a small customer, yes, small health with them and kind of used to vendors not supporting you as much, then probably it's okay. But we have large contracts with large vendors, and we hold them pretty tight in terms of support of ongoing maintenance.

And I think I got that. Again to add more color, like the start-up is probably able to move a little bit faster in terms of innovation and rolling out new features. But also on the flip side, they can also break things faster. And sometimes that's okay sometimes, not so much because this is health care and providing a note could have a tremendous impact in patient's chart.

We've seen some of that, also in terms of the timing, the EMRs truly of what they can and can't do. So a company might be ready -- EMR is now ready to move in that direction, then it doesn't really matter whether the start-up is ready or not or Microsoft is ready or not either way.

## Client
If you had to build your kind of -- if you had to choose from scratch, you don't have Nuance, you don't have Abridge. You have one Epic instance across the entire org, who do you go with and why?

## Expert
Oh boy. It depends -- it will depend on a couple of things. It will depend on how large of a health system I have that I'm dealing with, and what kind of pricing and ROI I could get. And also, I'd probably frame it as limit their contracts as well. So without getting into too many details, but it's not -- I would not do a long-term contract with either one of them, and we don't have long-term contracts with either one of them because the market is still sort of even though these two are top, it's going to be seen which one really matures or kind of comes out of ahead.

That being said, if I was a health system with a large Microsoft relationship, a large Microsoft customer and I was looking at -- I'm not just looking at AI sort of medical style space, I'm just looking at AI in general, and I have interest in having a lot of different AI solutions for my organization, whether it's efficiency, revenue, patient engagement, nurses, then I'll probably go with Microsoft because I'm not keen of having 10 different AI vendors -- solution vendors or to do 10 different things.

Would rather pick one horse and bet on all -- bet on that and also in terms of economies of scale because if I'm buying 10 things from you versus I'm buying 10 different things from 10 different vendors, it costs -- usually ends up costing more. Managing 10 different vendors and relationships are a lot tricky.

Now that being said, if I was a small health system or even medium-sized health system, I only really have money, resources, funding and plans to do only one or two AI solutions. I really want a good deal. I can negotiate with a partner, a vendor. I'm not a large Microsoft customer, might not even have Microsoft. Maybe I'd use Google Suite, that really don't have any leverage to negotiate with Microsoft. And Microsoft doesn't really negotiate with small clients because I've been on both sides. So I know how that works. Then probably go with Abridge.

Sorry, that was a long-winded answer, it's not a straightforward answer. But I mean, again, it depends on where -- because I have experience in both from large health systems to smaller midsized health system perspective.

## Client
So I mean, one thing I'll ask is from a product perspective, do you think there are parity? Like some things that we've heard about Abridge versus Nuance, like Abridge has stronger auditability and like actually being able to flip back to the recording and tie out whatever is transcripted, or it's multilingual to a greater degree, or there's some product features that we've at least heard are helping them win. First, can you validate this? And two, if it is true, how much weight do you put into it?

## Expert
Yes. And the second part of your question is really who, where. That's the bigger question to be quite honest. Sure. Abridge, that I can validate what you just said. The one or two things Abridge, you can do some auditability that DAX Express really doesn't have today. Same thing with languages. I think DAX Express is coming out with two, three languages, though, two, three languages. So that's yes, that's happening soon.

Again it depends on the health system you're in and how big of a market you have with different languages. So where I am in, middle of Pennsylvania, to be honest, like -- sure, we have diversity, but.

## Client
Mostly English, yes.

## Expert
Yes, mostly English, Like 95% of my patients -- actually, one more, 95% to 97% of my patients are English-speaking. Sure. Now don't get me wrong. Would it be nice to have for a solution that can cover my 2% to 3%? Absolutely. Now am I using that to make a decision on a huge vendor like this? Absolutely not.

Yes, same thing. Auditability, nice feature. Some of my really anal physicians that I respect very well like to go back and look at things very closely. But I also -- those are a handful. Most of my docs don't have time to go back and write like, let's just say, for example, you go through eight hours of clinic, eight or 10 hours a day. Nobody has time to go back and listen to eight and 10 hours of recording, if you can imagine.

Like this is what you guys do, I don't know, five calls a day, and you make notes and you make a recording sometimes. I know you're not recording but you might look at your notes. And usually, if you find hallucinations are one of the other things that do happen and could miss some things, could reframe things that you didn't really intend.

But at the same time, I also trust on well, it depends on workflows, too, number one, because now the workflows are fast enough and the note is generated in real time. So they are able to -- you don't really have the recall of -- you don't need to you don't have to recall like two days later.

You can look at the note right there and then and figure out like, oh, person X said this about UPMC, but oh, this note says this. You can recollect from your memory and fix it, if that makes any sense. You don't really necessarily need to go back and listen to figure out the auditability. Now granted, some docs, some providers might not go back two or three days later and could scratch and say, did he say 100 users or 10,000 users? Oh my gosh, I can't remember. I need to go back and listen to it because the AI made a hallucination on it.

Then it absolutely becomes a huge differentiator. But I think it's the workflow. And of course, the models continue to improve. That's playing a factor as well. The more the recordings, the more accurate it becomes. So the auditability goes down probably more and more. Now again, a nice feature to have, but it's not.

## Client
Yes. So it seems like the biggest factors for you are really it comes down to price a little bit and ROI and workflow and the depth of integration. Is that the right way to encapsulate sort of how you think about the driving factors between choosing vendors?

## Expert
To a degree, yes, all of the above, but also maturity and the overall landscape of each of the companies on how fast and continuously they will be able to evolve. Like we're pretty bullish on AI and we don't want to stop just with notes. We want to do other things as well. So which company will continue to evolve on the AI sort of promise?

## Client
Have you evaluated Abridge's road map at all? And have you seen sort of.

## Expert
Yes. Yes, absolutely. And both, Microsoft and Abridge's road map, been pretty close to that.

## Client
Which one excites you more?

## Expert
Good question. I think they both have promise, but a lot of vendors make a lot of promises to me so I don't get to it until they deliver it.

## Client
Last question for me is just if you had to like give me a sense of percentage difference, I recognize you're probably getting a discount because of bundling DAX Express with your broader Microsoft Health spend. But if you had to set a per doctor basis, what is the difference between Abridge pricing and Nuance DAX Express pricing?

## Expert
It's not that big, and I'll leave it at that.

## Client
Which one is bigger?

## Expert
No, it's not -- there's not big a difference between the two if that's what you're asking. And probably a unique perspective from me, I don't know if that's style, because of course, I talk to others. I don't know if that's accurate for everyone.

## Client
Perfect. Thank you for your time. This was very helpful.
