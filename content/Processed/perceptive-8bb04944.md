## Slide 3: PROBLEM
PROBLEM

**Legacy point solutions haven't delivered real leverage to care teams**
* Patient engagement tools are transactional, impersonal, and ineffective
* Don't integrate into the operations of healthcare teams
* Forms and symptom checkers produce incomplete or inaccurate assessments

**Outcomes-focused care models don't scale**
* 50-60% of total revenue spent on labor costs
* Variable quality and clinician burnout at high patient volumes
* Insufficient capacity to deliver frequent follow-up
* Economics don't work for many patient populations

What patients are saying

"There's a lot of online tools that let you answer multiple choice or forms to check symptoms...I think I would rather put it in my own words...because I'm pretty well able to articulate what's going on with me...
I'll be interested to see this become mainstream, I'm sure it will..."
Dawn, 63

"Great... it read between the lines and made it easy... it asked about things I didn't even think about."
Lisa, 74

"I'm amazed. Astonished beholding this... Its intelligence... If I have this, I'm not going to forget what I need to say"
Jean, 61

"I'm open to telling it everything because it won't judge me"
Natalie, 30

"It gives a better understanding... an active listener, both from the patient's point of view, as well as the doctor's point of view, is always, always helpful"
Marc, 53
