### Team Assessment & Investor History

- Shubh and John met summer 2022, 7th/8th investment from first fund
- Both were 25, youngest team in portfolio
- Evolution over 18 months shows exceptional maturity and strategic thinking
	- Shubh: Strong technical background from LiveRamp healthcare team, excels commercially
	- John: Sharp CTO who never stops working, thoughtful product development
	- Both now confident and hitting their stride
- Initial 18 months to gain commercial traction, significant inflection over last 12 months
	- 40+ customers currently
	- Data volume serves as leading indicator for revenue growth

### Market Position & Competitive Landscape

- Series B evaluation underway, data expected from Shubh shortly
- Continuous HIPAA certification vs 3-6 month consultant cottage industry
	- Automation reduces timeline from months to minutes/days
	- Clear product superiority established in market
- Datavant competitive dynamics shifting favorably
	- Privacy Hub performance issues driving customer migration
	- Datavant no longer neutral player due to IPO preparations
	- Acquisitions (Aton, Talis) creating conflicts with analytics customers
	- Industry feedback: customers proactively seeking alternatives
- Product excellence + market dynamics creating significant opportunity

### Expansion Strategy & Growth Vectors

- Looking at Series B, followed Shubh particularly interesting to hear
- Current customers: deepening pipeline + data without major new initiatives
- Expansion across multiple vectors
	- New products: Privacy agent, connect agent, insights layer
	- Biopharma: Clinical trials beyond current marketing/commercial focus
	- Share from Snowflake/Databricks: Data marketplace integration
	- AI tailwinds: Real-time certification for training data
- Multi-modal data opportunities (voice biomarkers, imaging, x-rays, MRIs)
- 50+ distinct client types with diverse use cases showing unlimited demand
- Long-term vision: Own value capture in AI deployment pipeline vs just being broker
