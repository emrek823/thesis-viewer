### Bad News Update

- End-to-end coding program for Astrana terminated (worst performing providers with 65% annual wellness visit completion rate, 60% HTC recapture rate)
- Achieved their annual average in 3 months before termination
- Stock price dropped 40%; contract cancelled without warning 2-3 weeks ago
- Stopped working with all vendors across quality programs
- Still expecting $200-300K from that program
- Outstanding invoices from February remain unpaid

### Financial Position

- $8.9M booked revenue for first half
- $300K in AR (Clover $200K, Astrana $50-100K)
- $3.1M in cash with $300K in outstanding AR
- Current burn rate: $100-150K/month
- Payroll: $100-140K/month
- Services business: 20% gross margins
- Tech/document review: 80-90% margins

### Pipeline & Opportunities

- Belong Health (ACO Reach)
	- 10K lives
	- $9 PMPY pricing
	- Expecting 6-figure contract
	- Additional services: billing, coding, chart chase
- Vituity Progress
	- Working on Epic access
	- Arrowhead integration challenge (don’t own hospital/health system)
	- Potential hack: Use Particle/HIE for data access
	- Steps: Get Epic access, compare to Particle, contract
	- $2-3M opportunity; targeting $200-300K retainer with 30% upside
- Additional Targets
	- Emblem + 1 more
	- Target: $1.5M - $2M

### New Mountain Capital (NMC) Intelligence

- No equity rollover post-SDX acquisition
- SDX current business expected to continue growing
- NMC focused on data science team potential for provider-focused assets
- Planning unusual approach to payment integrity and UM
- Existing investors not fully aware of strategy
- Additional acquisitions: Machinify, Apixio

### Market Analysis

- Datavant is scaling
- Vytalize is scaling
- NMC is scaling
- Building (vs scaling) is challenging in these environments
- Opportunity: Partner and build out coding capabilities
	- Risk adjustment chart chase and coding
	- HEDIS chart chase and coding

### Series A Targets

- Goal: $10M ARR with less than $10M invested
- Milestone targets: $1-2M ARR with $2M in bank
- Current runway: $3.3M for 9-12 months
- Key differentiator vs SDX:
	- SDX: Clean data, simple encounters ($10K encounters = $1M revenue)
	- ValleySteer: Complex records requiring prediction and follow-up
	- Strategy: Moving to “at-risk” model - customers pay only for findings
