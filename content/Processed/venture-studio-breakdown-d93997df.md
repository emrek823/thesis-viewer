## Page 1: Introductory Notes

Hey guys,

A few important things to note before you read:

*   Firms are experimenting with approach to strategy and structure, so what's captured here is generalized from the data points I have (there are obviously exceptions in cases)
*   I gathered this from my POV as a founder evaluating diff models, which is why many of the descriptors reference things like: point in time when founding CEO is brought in, firm resources, founder ownership %
*   For apples-to-apples comparison, numbers capture a snapshot @ seed, fully diluted (unless stated otherwise). In cases where I only had data on pre-seed or Series A I made standard dilution assumptions, etc.
*   Happy to talk in more detail... the numbers are intentionally anonymized because I was asked NOT to share specifics linking terms to names of firms. If names are called out, it's because it was OK'ed by the person or publicly available
*   Please don't share more broadly. I don't want things getting randomly forwarded and potentially taken out of context from what this initial exercise was meant for -- my own selfish life decision-making!
