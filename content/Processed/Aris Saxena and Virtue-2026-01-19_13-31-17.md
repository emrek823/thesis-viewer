### Revenue Recognition & Contract Structure

- Current signed ARR: $1.5M (live with all customers as of Friday)
	- Alexion: $350K (12-month contract, signed end of last year)
	- Sanofi: Two teams - Dupixent and General Medicine brands
	- UCB: Quarterly contract structure for Bimzelx
	- Pfizer: Going live Friday
- Booked pipeline: $2.7M total (includes $1.2M in contracts expected to close within 2-3 weeks)
	- Row 17-20 contracts represent over $1M in near-term revenue
	- High confidence on closure timeline - finalizing contract language
- MSA agreements secured for 4-5 year terms (the actual hard part)
	- SOWs structured as series of episodes, not traditional recurring software contracts
	- Replacing marketing agencies in pharmaceutical commercial space

### Pitch Positioning Strategy

- Report as “run rate” rather than “recurring revenue” to avoid investor credibility issues
	- Live run rate: $1.5M
	- Expected run rate by end of month: $2.7M
- Avoid three-tier categorization (live/contracted/booked) - simplify to live vs pipeline
	- Contract-to-live timeline extremely tight (days to 2-3 weeks max)
	- Strong relationship between contracted and actual revenue recognition
- Emphasize product-market fit evidence
	- 10+ signed contracts across major pharma companies
	- Email snapshot showing C-suite validation of approach
	- Land-and-expand already happening with existing customers

### Fundraising Process Coordination

- Byron call scheduled at 4:30 PM Eastern today
- Dee Dee also reaching out for coordination
- Tier 2/3 firms first to build rhythm, then approach Sequoia/GC-level firms
	- Additional week could add material run rate before top-tier meetings
	- Risk mitigation if pipeline contracts don’t close as expected
- Model updates needed to show expansion by customer/brand rather than arbitrary ACV assumptions
	- Break out revenue by specific brands within each pharma company
	- Show concrete expansion paths (e.g., AstraZeneca’s 7 brands, Takeda’s 5-7 brands)

### Next Steps

- Update forecast model with sales pipeline as source of truth
- Adjust slide 3 to show $1.5M live run rate (remove $2.7M until contracts signed)
- Add expansion revenue section showing brand-level contract progression
- Coordinate fundraising timeline with Byron and Dee Dee
