## Partnering for Progress

Primary care teams of patients with multi-chronic conditions are responsible for coordinating treatments prescribed by 7-9 physicians and delivered by 15-25 extended care team members. Because general EMR tech advances only add administrative burden to this type of outcome-critical coordination, primary care teams resort to easier manual, outdated processes. Communication becomes more fragmented, care is delayed, and treatment plans are merely reactive. Ursamin delivers clinical-grade coordination tools that include seamless onboarding and ongoing support for even the most overwhelmed care teams.

## What we do

Ursamin is a digital health platform that helps doctors, nurses, and staff streamline care coordination by organizing data and surfacing care needs by patient and by role. We connect to national exchanges and EHRs to assemble a longitudinal patient profile, align it to team workflows, and highlight critical care gaps in real-time. Our platform supports role-based data alignment, task tracking by user, and longitudinal management—revealing workflow bottlenecks and empowering clinics to reallocate staff more effectively. Instead of spending hours hunting for records or chasing faxes, teams know exactly what’s due next, for whom, and by whom. The result: better outcomes for high-risk and chronic patients, improved clinic efficiency and profitability, and reduced burnout across the care team.

## Imagine a world where:

## What providers are saying:

"We receive patients round the clock, every day of the week. Without immediate access to their medical records, we have to rely on the PCP office to send the necessary past medical history, medications, and test results via fax or discuss them over the phone. Unfortunately, the offices are closed at night and on weekends, causing significant delays in obtaining vital information. As a result, we often have to repeat tests to get the results quickly, which means subjecting the patients to unnecessary needle pokes, urine catheterization, or radiology procedures. In the case of pediatric patients, this is especially distressing as they are often scared and the procedures can be painful. I can't stress enough how impactful Ursaminis in solving these problems. It puts the entire medical record in the hands of the patients and caregivers, ensuring crucial information is available at the point of care."

## Navigate the Shift to Value

Your Patients are Getting Robbed. Old school paperwork robs patients of 50% of their clinical team’s time and energy, a root cause of burnout and leaving the healthcare field. Administrative overload is quickly becoming the greatest threat to patient outcomes.

Ursamin’s Care Coordination platform enables every team member to quickly access the right information at the right time and in the right format, so they can focus on their expertise, precisely when your patients need it.
