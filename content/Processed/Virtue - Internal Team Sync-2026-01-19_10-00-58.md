### Deal Flow and Investor Process Updates

- Processing higher volume of pitches than expected
	- Quality concerns: many lack domain expertise despite LinkedIn credentials
	- Strategy shift: let founders talk more vs. constraining to specific topics early
	- Follow-up cadence: check back in 3-6 months for noisy top-of-funnel deals
- Call summary automation improvements
	- Maintain separate sections for manual vs. automated content
	- Add “To Do” and “Discussion” sections at top for manual entries

### Active Pipeline - Priority Prospects

- Tushar (10X/Will’s company)
	- Strong payments background from logistics/trucking, applying to healthcare
	- Specific expertise: AR/AP dynamics, matching EFTs to ERAs
	- Current status: defining customer focus vs. what to build
	- Clear 3-6 month roadmap with hiring plan in place
- Will (translucent midstream/supply chain)
	- Reminds of Zach Gonzalez - strong operator potential
	- Young with operating background, need to meet co-founder
	- Similar approach to Tushar for partnership development

### Portfolio Updates and Reinvestment Strategy

- SMB reinvestment decision
	- Acknowledging this doesn’t meet new diligent reinvestment bar
	- Need robust defense for LPs given previous messaging about disciplined approach
	- Priority position requiring bi-weekly check-ins going forward
	- Third commercial hire needed to secure pharma contracts
- Solstice progress
	- Strong customer validation email from CEO requesting specific builds
	- Email dated Jan 13 serves as product-market fit proxy
	- Recommend redacting names and including in deck as case study
- Integral status check needed
	- Multiple ICs scheduled (Flair, Maverick, Wavemaker)
	- Round still open after month+ - confirm term sheet status

### Next Steps

- Today/This week:
	- Text Tushar and Will with follow-up calls
	- Prepare dossiers/memos for both prospects using healthcare workflow analysis
	- Connect Will with Jack if both parties interested
	- Aggressive outbound to 70-bucket prospects vs. 30-bucket
- Portfolio management:
	- Contract review for SMB with specific numbers validation
	- Solstice customer email integration into pitch materials
	- Confirm Integral round status and remaining ICs
- Q1 goals:
	- Target 2+ new deals this quarter
	- Maintain momentum from Q3 pace
	- Focus: deal flow #1, portfolio #2, LP relations distant #3
