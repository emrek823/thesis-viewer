# Assort Health - C-suite Level Employee at a Surgical Services Management Organization

Interview conducted on May 02, 2025

## Topics
AI Patient Engagement, Call Centers, Voice in Healthcare, AI Voice, Cultural Diversity, AI Interface, Appointment Scheduling, Algorithm Development

## Summary
The Tegus Client and expert discussed the successful implementation of the AI patient engagement tool Confido in 74 clinics, starting with one clinic handling 100 calls a day. The importance of Confido understanding accents in a diverse patient population was emphasized, with extensive training and customization for each clinic. The transition to AI aimed to streamline operations, reduce staffing costs, and provide continuous service to patients, replacing the pre-AI setup involving clinic coordinators and a central call center for overflow calls.

**Client**
Hi, thanks for taking the time to chat about AI patient engagement or AI call centers. I don't think there's a term to it, but it's everything around engaging the patient using voice in healthcare as well as engaging payers and whatever workloads go to the call center. I think you mentioned that you guys are customers of Confido.

Would love to understand reasons for that adoption in terms of evaluating the player. How did you guys go about it, what were criteria that was important to you? Lastly, how performance has been post implementation adopting the tool. Broadly, these are dimensions I'm looking to understand. If you're comfortable with it, we can proceed.

**Expert**
Sure. We actually went through a pretty extensive process before we moved forward with Confido, so can share that with you.

**Client**
Okay. I would first just love a brief overview about how the practice has, and where have you implemented Confido? A little bit about the scale, volume of calls Confido is handling, how much you're paying them. Just a brief and then I can get into the details.

**Expert**
Just a little bit about us. We have now technically 74 different practices across the country in 16 different states. North to south and east to west really represent a cross section of America and practice types. I think in the end, that's why we settled with Confido. It was important to us that whoever the AI voice was was able to understand and respond to people with accents because we are in some really culturally diverse regions and the patients have pretty accented people. That was really a big thing for us.

**Client**
Got it. In terms of the volumes that you guys are probably routing through Confido and anything on even the contract size in case you guys have started paying or using the tool.

**Expert**
We rolled them out at one clinic first. Everyone's always anxious about using AI as the interface with patients. We rolled it out in our clinic where they love us and even if we fell flat on our face, they still wouldn't be upset with us. Confido started handling about 100 calls a day during regular business hours. We actually rolled it out at full steam, just had it start taking all the calls on the day it did.

Actually, It's been really well. I don't have the exact specifics, but it's in the high 90s that a high 90% of phone calls actually make it through to either booking or asking to speak to a person. The vast majority of them end up just booking their phone call.

We set it up that way that if it's simple and straightforward, we want Confido to make the appointment. If the patient has any questions whatsoever, if they fall off the algorithm at all, we want them to refer that over to a human. It's been less than I expected. I was expecting folks to say, "I want to talk to a human right away." That's not been the case. They've just been scheduling their appointments.

**Client**
Interesting. You said you started off with one location. When did you start working with them? Is it that one location only?

**Expert**
We started working with them in about January. Kudos to them for this. The ramp-up process took some time. They actually spent time in a lot of our clinics listening to how our people answer the phone and respond. It turns out our scripts are not the same in every location.

They actually spent a good amount of time learning how we do that and what the algorithm ought to be. It seems like they're not doing much in the beginning, but that's what they're doing. They're building out the algorithm so that when they show you the demo, it's pretty much done. There was very little editing that we needed to do and so we were able to roll that out pretty quickly.

Now we've been doing it about a month down in the Southwest market. We also are starting in the Denver market as well. We did a little pilot in the Denver area. It worked, and so we'll be rolling it out completely in the Denver market on, It's May 1st. That will be today, and then we will roll it out over the rest of the country in June.

**Client**
That's awesome. Out of the 74 locations, these three areas that you guys have rolled it out to, how many would that in terms of just numbers?

**Expert**
Four. There have been four that have it and they're really pretty different. The four that have it are pretty different. We're feeling confident that they can manage it.

**Client**
Understood. What was your role in this entire engagement and who else was involved from.

**Expert**
I'm a C-suite level employee, and it was my COO who did the legwork on this.

**Client**
Makes sense. Overall, the entire front-end patient engagement piece, does that roll up to the COO?

**Expert**
Yes.

**Client**
I think this gives me great understanding. I'd love to just get started a little bit on the way you were handling some of this prior to Confido coming in. I've heard different ways people do it. You either have a dedicated contact center, you may just have nurses picking up the phone. I'd love to understand this pre-everything voice AI. How was some of this running and what were some pain points that actually led you to maybe explore those often?

**Expert**
Our standard approach is we have folks who work in the clinic. Depending upon how busy the clinic is determines how many clinic coordinators we have. Their job would be to answer the phones and get all the patients scheduled for their follow-up. We are big enough that we also have a national call center that all of our programs are hooked up on the same phone system.

If somebody is out, somebody is sick, there are a lot of calls. They can go into our central call location, and we have people there who know where the call is coming from and know the appropriate script for each of those programs. If you are calling from the Southwest, you are calling from Scottsdale, they will know what program that is. If you are calling from Tucson, they will know what program that is, and will respond accordingly.

It was really 100% dependent on humans. People get sick, they are expensive, they need raises. We are looking to scale, too. This was a big decision for us because this takes a lot of time. People are answering the phone eight hours a day. By moving to a system like this, we are able to staff our clinics a little bit lighter with people and still deliver really good service.

The other thing is sometimes people get busy, and basically the robot never stops. The phone is not ever busy. They can always interact with the AI agent, which I think is better than trying to get them to leave a detailed message, which is what we used to do.

**Client**
Understood. The setup that you have, would calls first go to the clinic, and if there was excessive load, it gets routed to the national center? How did that system work?

**Expert**
Correct. At the clinic site, if the clinic coordinators are busy or they're out for the day, whatever it is, they forward the phones automatically to our central call station, and then the phones will be managed centrally.

**Client**
Got it. At each clinic, how many folks? What I'm also trying to understand is just out of the admin stuff, if there's any split where you say there's X number of people in charge of handling the phone calls, is that a way you look at it? Is everyone in charge of picking up the phone when working?

**Expert**
At our busier clinics, it's shared tasks. Everybody does everything. Even though everyone's trained to do everything, it always shakes out that somebody ends up doing more of the phones than somebody else. That's just the way it works. At our smaller clinics, there is only one coordinator, and they are responsible for doing everything, including rooming the patients. The phones get forwarded during times when we're busy, when we have patients in the clinic. This AI piece was nice to cover that.

**Client**
Well, this was super helpful. Thank you for your time and hope you have a great day!
