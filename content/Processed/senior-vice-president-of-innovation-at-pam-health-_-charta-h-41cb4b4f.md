**A:** LTPAC and Chronic Health

**Client**
Hi, thanks for taking the time. For some context, I am looking at a company, Charta, in the chart review space, and you guys are currently in a POC with them. I would love to maybe just start with hearing a bit about your background, PAM Health and how you guys got introduced to Charta and a little bit about the POC.

**Expert**
What specifically?

**Client**
We can start with, what at PAM Health made you guys look for a solution like Charta?

**Expert**
I think really, from our perspective, one of the things we realized is that on the revenue cycle time process, the typical standard is you send a claim out, the claim goes to the clearinghouse, ultimately gets accepted or denied, and then you have to rework it and there's delay, there's lag, and you can't review 100% of all your claims.

You can do spot checks and things of that nature, but imagine if you had a tool that you could do a pre-bill analysis of what you're sending out to determine on the front end if it's going to have a high degree of success making it through the ultimate payment and reducing turnaround time, denial rates, and ultimately, improving cash flow. For us, that was the rationale to do it.

**Client**
Got you. When you're doing the POC with Charta, did you guys also look at other products in the space?

**Expert**
We did, and I think I found Charta to be the most advanced, and met with their CEO and folks, and see how they did their operation to know where they're at and how they're projected for future.

**Client**
Got you. Which other products did you guys look at?

**Expert**
The ones you had listed.

**Client**
Just Brellium and SmarterDx?

**Expert**
That's it.

**Client**
Yeah, I would love to hear the more detailed breakdown between what.

**Expert**
I think the biggest piece, as mentioned, is we want something that's pre-bill review, and that the AI is based on workflow and current understanding of payer rules because you have to design it for your specific payer contracts. It's got to be something that can be easily adapted, the tool. Something that the rulemaking shouldn't be an arduous process, but that once you are able to develop the rule book and you do your initial assessments, you can do it easily.

I think some of the other tools that I saw is to get the rules of your specific contracts entered was a heavy lift. A lot of development time, a lot of engineering time to get those rules input into their data. To me, that's the challenge. We want the team to work quickly. We want them to be able to interpret the contract in such a way that it shouldn't be that much of a burden.

**Client**
That makes a lot of sense. To my knowledge, the other players, Brellium and Charta, which we looked probably most closely at these two, Charta is more focused on coding and certain primary care-type practices, and Brellium is more quality of care-focused, and also maybe more on the behavioral health side. Would you say that's.

**Expert**
That's true. I think to your point, it's probably looking at the outcomes piece. I think Charta, if you were to think about what are the spaces that Charta has probably, could be very helpful. Imagine a physician practice can be very helpful because there's no way they could audit 100% of their charts, and do so in a manner to adapt rules and things of that nature.

This, of course, is a great tool that would normally take an outside RCM company that they would pay for, that this can be layered on in their existing practice, done at a relatively reasonable cost, but act as if they were using an outside entity to do this for them. When I mean outside entity, a billing company. I do think there's a lot of strength there.

The other piece is, if you think about the Charta tool, it's adaptable to the ambulatory space period, and it can go into the inpatient space too. I think it has a number of pathways. When you work with their team and you identify your scope of work or what you're looking for, they will design it for you. It's very customizable. That's the difference.

**Client**
Yeah. We would love to learn more about the POC metrics you guys are seeing/like. Would want to see for you guys to go into production, in terms of denial reduction, days for accounts receivable, or any other metrics you guys might have.

**Expert**
Yeah. I think the biggest piece, what I would say is, and I'll give you some broad terms, just to give you some guide. If we were having a 78% pass-through success, and in some other lines maybe 81% initial pass-through success, now we're seeing mid 90s-percent.

If you can equate that to days, in terms of getting your cash flow sooner, and what I mean by that is, if a claim is denied and you think the cycle time to process and readjust it and edit the claim, let's say it's another 45 days. If you've improved from, let's say, 81% to mid 90s-percent, you had a +10%, +12%, +13% increase in favorable first initial pass, and then if you reduced cycle time to getting your cash flow, it's material.

**Client**
That makes sense. In terms of how good are each of these solutions out of the box for you guys? Where did each solution struggle the most or need customization for the specific ambulatory workflows you guys deal with?

**Expert**
I think the biggest piece is that when you go into the initial scope of work and you work with their engineers and their team, they're very hands-on. I think it's A) because they're in rapid growth and they want to do a good job. Initially, we were early adopters, so I think for them, they were wanting to make sure they did it right with us, and so they put a lot of resource into it. I think now, if you try to get into their queue, their queue is probably quite a bit of time to get in to be a new start. I think the experience that we have from early adoption was very favorable. If you think about it, it's about a six-week process from soup to nuts.

**Client**
That makes sense. My impression is also that Charta is more focused on serving more the upper end of the market. It seems like PAM Health is also a pretty big organization and Brellium is more serving the smaller/medium-sized practices. Would you say that's the case, and what about the product would you say makes it that way?

**Expert**
I think Charta is aligned with Kaiser. If you think about how large Kaiser is, to be able to support that and have a lot of success at some large health systems, I think it's a testament, their tool has applicability in being able to accurately review large data sets. I think that's the big difference. I don't see Brellium being able to have that same impact. I think their leadership too. I think Justin Liu has a strong reputation and he's willing to put himself in the position to support it.

**Client**
Yeah. Could you maybe dig more into that point about the Kaiser alignment, what that looks like? You mentioned larger data sets as well as just the product experience overall.

**Expert**
I think for me, experiential, you think about the white-glove service that we found with Charta versus the others. To me, that's important. Again, I preface it, that they were new and they were trying to make an impact in the market, so I I think that from that sense, it's important when you're trying to make an impact that they're willing to go above and beyond and try to make it work for you.

**Client**
Got you. Are you guys aware, for them to get to this 90% for Chart review? I think all of these teams have some services component as well to catch the last mile of errors. Are you aware of that as a customer, how much of a percentage that accounts for?

**Expert**
Yeah. One of the things that was important to us is being able to know, based on how we use the tool, what are the errors that it's identifying for us. As part of the rules, you can narrow them or you can widen them. Initially, you have pretty narrow rules just to make sure things are you got it to where you want it, then when you start getting experience, you can see, "Okay, I can widen the tolerances here," but what comes back is the ability.

I think what's important is that as you adjust your rules and you start seeing like, "Oh, it kicked back this claim and these are the reasons," so "Oh, this is a simple X modifier issue," and it's picking it up a lot, then we know that we need to make some adjustments. Once you do that, then you say, "All right, I cleared that. Now I know in our actual claims processing, what we're seeing as an issue."

It identifies things that you can actually proactively adjust. You adjust it, and then all of a sudden, instead of taking back a whole bunch of claims because it had a unique issue that you hadn't built within your own EMR system, you solved even more problems that was going to arise from that.

**Client**
Got you. In terms of where Charta expands from here, if you were to guess, what other parts of the general RCM workflow or within adjacent spaces do you think they're planning to expand or could.

**Expert**
If you think, right now, they probably have a niche in a couple areas. They're probably doing really good in the physician office space. They're doing really good in developing ambulatory capabilities. When you say ambulatory capabilities, I think they can expand into every space that has a claims submission-based issue.

If you think about why they developed their organization, they developed the organization, they were looking at what problems needed solving, and they recognized RCM was a problem that needed solving, then there was a lot of lanes within that space. As they perfect and they gain success in the ones that they are in, I think it lends to a couple places. I think about, it can get into infusion, it can get into home health, it can get into the outpatient surgery spaces.

I think there's a lot of lanes for it, but right now, they're probably focused on the things that A) will give them the biggest packet, and then what are synergistic. If you think of Kaiser, and Kaiser has a lot of different avenues that would lend them to get expertise and have scale and then compete with, or not so much compete. If they can get a Kaiser health system, a Kaiser, then plan, imagine being able to offer their services in reverse to payers to predict how they can be better at ensuring their prior authorizations.

I think there's a payer angle here that they can do. I just think it's probably going to be a later offering once they build continued success where they're at. Great, you're helping me, as a provider, get through better results on my claim submissions, but I can also see on the payer side, "Hey, these providers are getting really good at their first-time pass. How do we reverse engineer now to be able to know how we can ensure our authorization systems are better, to capture nuances that maybe we're not picking up?"

**Client**
That makes sense. In terms of how you guys think about what you'd be willing to pay for a chart review solution, how do you think about what makes sense there?

**Expert**
I think chart review is one thing. I think the standard has been, "Oh, we'll take 10% of certain claims and things of that nature," and you do a statistical snapshot, but the complexities of your contracts are so different at every state that we operate in every market, within a state that we operate, and the different contractual terms that we have to have, just doing randomized spot checks isn't going to be enough, but you also don't want to get an external agency that all they do is a lot of manual chart review process because then you're getting to human error and they can't review as many charts. Imagine being able to do 100% of your chart reviews through an AI tool.

**Client**
That makes a lot of sense. You mentioned there was a six-week setup process. How would you break down the different parts of that timeline, like the contracting, testing, go live? Just want to get a better sense of what that looks like.

**Expert**
Yeah. I think the biz terms, and getting through that initial piece, I felt that was fairly quick as you know it, but the first piece, of course, was understanding the scope, "What are we asking and what does our business model look like and what are the claim types that we're going to feed through the system and the payers?"

They need to have a little bit of due diligence to be able to understand, "How do we model for your entity?" We were rather new for them, looking at it differently, non-physician office, so to speak. In doing that, it opened up their eyes like, "Oh, guess what?" We also use them for reviewing we have our wound center claims which looks different.

I just think that there's more utility there. For us, the first period of time, and I don't count the contracting review as part of the six weeks. For me, the six weeks is once you get the terms, once you get to understanding what the scope of work is and they've done their assessment of what our ask is, then I think it's the six weeks of "All right, it's going to be about two and a half weeks to three weeks of developing the rules." It's going to be some dry runs. It's going to be some testing, and then specific work groups in content areas.

If it's outpatient therapy, having PTs, OTs, and speech, understanding what are the rules that are aligned with their types of bill submissions because they have different rules. It could be a timed rule, it can be a session rule, it can be a treatment rule, and really understanding what are the things that they need to incorporate into the rules so that when we process the claim it does it.

**Client**
Got you. What week are you guys into your POC?

**Expert**
We are about three months into it.

**Client**
Got you. The six-week setup, that was prior to the POC?

**Expert**
Yes.

**Client**
Got you. How's the POC going after three months?

**Expert**
That's going good. That's where we're starting to see some initial positivity on our reduction time, in terms of the denials, and we're starting to see how we can adjust our rules to be a little broader and not be so narrow, everything's not coming back. We've identified fixes on our end.

**Client**
Makes sense. Jumping back to the earlier point, I know we talked about Brellium versus Charta, we'd love to hear more about your thoughts on SmarterDx because they are the oldest player in this space, and I think there's been some maybe PE consolidations where they've joined up with other parts of.

**Expert**
Yeah. Think of it as in terms of an Epic and an Oracle Epic was built ground up. It's a particular tool type. Oracle is multiple tools that they're trying to seamlessly integrate together and to be more full suite of capabilities. I think I look at Charta as an Epic, and that their goal is to really streamline the physician burden on the administrative process. I didn't meet with the SmarterDx CEO. I think he's got a physician background, so he's looking at it from that lens. I think there's something there. We didn't do a lot of due diligence with them, given that we just recognized that they weren't there yet.

**Client**
That makes sense. A lot of these companies that have been around for a long time don't necessarily build the best product either.

**Expert**
Yeah.

**Client**
Yeah. Anything else you think I should have asked to understand Charta's positioning in this market?

**Expert**
What I would say in terms of their positioning, I think they have multiple pathways that they can do, but they're going to be smart. They're going to focus on the areas that they can build some really good strength and gain market adoption. I think they've identified, and rightly so, on the physician space is going to have a significant impact. That's going to lend to the health systems, and then from there, within the health systems, it's going to open up different service lines. I think it's the right approach.

I also think that it's the way they're building it, "Yes, grow fast, but grow smart. Don't lose sight of what your core competencies are." They're going to allow them to be more successful. I think the market's rewarding. If you're looking who's backing them, it's telling you that they've really put a lot of value in their tool.

**Client**
That makes a lot of sense. The market in general for chart review type tools, would you say it's a fairly large market?

**Expert**
Yes.

**Client**
Got you. What are the other software tools you guys use at PAM Health, AI or software?

**Expert**
I think we're all looking at our EMRs, what type of AI capability will be, to be able to do longitude assessments of our own data to make predictive insights, and then understand that "How can we take these insights and apply them at bedside?" Not only from an outcomes perspective, but guess what, that we can reduce expenses.

**Client**
Makes a lot of sense. You guys are, I think, paying six figures for Charta?

**Expert**
Yeah, we're in the low six figures right now because I think we're very tailored to how we're utilizing it right now. I think also because we were early. I'm sure if we were to try to redo this now, it'd be different. I think if we were to have to start off as a brand new customer like today, I'm sure the pricing would be different.

**Client**
That makes a lot of sense. Thank you so much for taking your time. It's super helpful.
