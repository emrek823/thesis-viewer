## Abstract

Technological innovations such as eHealth are vital for improving healthcare accessibility, quality, and sustainability. While most research addresses adoption at the individual or team level, less is known about organisational factors enabling sustainable transformation. Organisational readiness is a key determinant of success. The Organizational eHealth Readiness (OeHR) model, developed in Polish primary care, assesses five dimensions: Strategy, Competence, Culture, Structure, and Technology, but its applicability in Dutch health care remains unclear. This mixed-methods study evaluated the OeHR model in Dutch hospitals. A validated 32-item questionnaire, translated into Dutch, was completed by managers and implementation specialists of 15 top-clinical hospitals (n=22). Descriptive statistics, regression analyses, and Principal Component Analysis provided insight into how the five dimensions jointly reflect organisational readiness for eHealth. Three focus groups (n=14) in two hospitals explored construct interpretation, missing dimensions, and model usability. Qualitative data were analysed using deductive coding on OeHR dimensions and emergent themes to refine the questionnaire. Quantitative analyses identified organisational culture as the only significant predictor of subjective eHealth readiness, while other dimensions showed no independent effect. Open responses and focus groups confirmed the centrality of culture and suggested refinements to all components, including clearer definitions, structural flexibility, and attention to external factors. Overall, the OeHR model was valued for strategic guidance but required contextualisation for practical use. This study showed that the OeHR model provides a valuable framework for assessing eHealth readiness in Dutch hospitals, with cultural readiness emerging as the most influential yet conceptually ambiguous dimension. Strategy, competence, structural and technological readiness mainly act as contextual enablers rather than direct predictors. The findings highlight the need to refine definitions, reduce overlap, and explore additional layers such as personal, operational, and societal readiness. Strengthening conceptual clarity and developing context-sensitive tools could enhance applicability and guide hospitals in translating readiness into digital transformation.
