The healthcare technology sector is at a turning point, which could mark the bursting of a financial bubble. After a two-year period between 2024 and 2025 characterised by unprecedented capital inflows and booming valuations, the market would be heading for a structural correction in 2026.

The fear of a 'bursting' of the artificial intelligence bubble applied to healthcare is not attributable to a simple negative venture capital cycle, but appears to be the mathematical outcome of three converging forces, according to analysts at consultancy Nelson Advisors: 'an abrupt regulatory jump imposing typical hardware compliance costs on software start-ups, the maturation of financial obligations taken on at the height of the euphoria phase, and an operational 'reality bath' in healthcare systems, which is rapidly closing the window on the pilot project-based business model'.

The data indicate that while the small group of so-called 'AI aristocrats', i.e. companies such as Abridge, Xaira and Strive Health, have sufficient resources to make it through a recession, the majority of the ecosystem survives on 'unlabelled' bridge funding (which does not include a value attribution to the start-up) and unvalidated clinical promises. In 2026, the shift from 'promise' to 'proof' risks exposing the business fragilities of many AI-based services, valued as high-margin SaaS platforms, but in reality dependent on heavy human intervention and very long sales cycles, according to the report.

The Four O's of the Bubble

Nelson Advisors' analysis identifies the systemic risks that will converge in 2026, identifying them in the four 'O's' of the bubble (Overinvestment, Overvaluation, Overownership and Overleverage), to which are added the existential threat posed by the European AI Act and the FDA's Quality Management System Regulation (QMSR), as well as the phenomenon of 'death by pilot', i.e. start-ups that fail because they are trapped in an endless sequence of pilot projects that never turn into true, scalable commercial contracts. Added to this, analysts point out, is the aggressive entry into the market of incumbents, such as the big incumbent digital health player Epic Systems, which is destined to drastically reduce the space for niche solutions proposed by start-ups.

In conclusion, therefore, 2026 could mark a real Darwinian selection for AI start-ups dedicated to the healthcare sector, paving the way for a more industrialised and consolidated digital infrastructure.

Macro-financial distortions

To understand the magnitude of the correction expected in 2026, it is necessary to analyse the financial anomalies of previous years: in 2024 and 2025, capital allocation became progressively disconnected from market fundamentals, creating an unbalanced and vulnerable ecosystem, according to the Nelson Advisors report. For example, in the first three quarters of last year, the digital health sector had raised $9.9 billion, exceeding the previous year's pace. Almost 40 per cent of this capital, however, went into just 19 'mega deals' in excess of $100 million. Deals such as Strive Health ($550 million), Judi Health ($400 million) and Ambience Healthcare ($243 million) took up the bulk of the available cash.

"This concentration signals a 'flight to safety' on the part of closed-end fund investors and venture capitalists, who have preferred to focus on a few perceived winners, leaving the 'middle class' of start-ups without resources," the report reads. So much so that in Q3 2025, Series B rounds were half the historical average, with just 30 deals, creating a bottleneck in the companies' growth path.

Of further concern is the rise of 'unlabelled' rounds: in 2025, around 35 per cent of digital health funding took place without a specific round series or start-up valuation. Historically, these rounds represent an attempt to postpone the recognition of a valuation, analysts point out. Next year, when these financing instruments expire, investors will have to choose between converting the loans on penalising terms or writing off the investment, with the risk of a wave of forced liquidations.

Also weighing on the macroeconomic front is the so-called 'maturity wall' of corporate debt scheduled for 2026. "Start-ups that have resorted to venture debt during the zero-rate era will face much higher refinancing costs. In a scenario of rates hovering around 3.5 per cent, as predicted by Vanguard, even companies with good products but high burn rates (the rate at which the company consumes available cash) could be pushed towards bankruptcy," the report highlights.

The operational crisis: 'death by pilot'

If finance can sustain a company for a few quarters, it is the operational reality that decrees its survival. For many healthcare AI start-ups, 2026 will mark the end of the pilot era, according to the report, which points out that healthcare systems have been inundated with experiments in recent years: digital scribes, predictive algorithms, decision support tools. However, the conversion of pilots into actual contracts with client companies has remained minimal. Moving from proof of concept to production requires deep integrations with electronic health records, rigorous cybersecurity controls and a tangible ROI. By 2025, healthcare executives have begun to openly declare 'pilot fatigue', initiating a drastic reduction in vendors, analysts point out.

"A downsizing of niche solutions is expected in 2026. Hospitals are rationalising their technology stacks, favouring integrated platforms such as Epic, Oracle or Commure, at the expense of start-ups focused on single functions, whose addressable market does not justify the costs of integration,' the report states.

The regulatory guillotine

2026 will see the convergence of key regulations in the US and Europe. As of 2 August this year, the full requirements of the European AI Act will come into force for high-risk systems, a category into which much of clinical AI falls. "Compliance audits, stringent requirements on data governance and algorithm interpretability will result in estimated costs of between $1 million and $2 million per year for a Series A start-up, with the risk of a veritable 'market blackout' for non-compliant companies," the analysts write.

The real risks of a bubble

"The fear of an AI bubble bursting in healthcare in 2026 is not the result of scaremongering, but the logical consequence of inflated expectations, regulatory tightening and economic constraints. The industry is moving from an exploratory phase, dominated by pilots and hype, to an industrialisation phase, where compliance, clinical validation and measurable returns will count,' Nelson Advisors writes, continuing: '2026 could bring widespread failures, opportunistic M& A deals and a profound reassessment of valuations. However, for those companies that survive, those that have invested early in integration, quality, and clinical soundness, a new phase of growth on a healthier and more sustainable footing will begin."
