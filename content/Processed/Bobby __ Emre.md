### Protege Business Update

- Almost all major labs are either customers or serious prospects
- Business growing 2x faster than expected in Q1
- Traditional healthcare companies actively pursuing AI initiatives
- Medical device companies showing strong interest - likely to sign first med device customer this quarter

### AI Model Training Landscape

- Labs driving majority of high-volume purchases
- Other healthcare companies focusing more on ML applications and fine-tuning
- Large medical device companies making significant imaging data investments
- Specific use cases emerging for specialized data types (e.g., hospital timestamps)
- Small startups unlikely to spend $20M+ on model training initially

### Strategic Focus and Market Position

- Deliberately avoiding pharma sector
- Claims data not a primary focus for their business
- Shifting from pure data brokerage to platform approach
- Building massive longitudinal multimodal datasets
- Goal: Achieve scale with millions of patients worth of linked notes, pathology, and imaging data

### Real World Data (RWD) Market Insights

- Challenging experiences with specific pharma-type deals
- Example: Complex project requiring 400 patients with specific multimodal criteria
- Industry trending toward massive longitudinal multimodal datasets
- AI space driving acute need for comprehensive linked data
- Traditional RWD companies facing market challenges

### Next Steps

- Bobby to connect with Rafa from Network Files (via Emre’s introduction)
- Future meetup in New York when schedules align
- Continue discussions around model providers and industry developments
