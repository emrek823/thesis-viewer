“We see tremendous potential in Claude being able to streamline how we bring drugs to market. The ability to pull from various sources of clinical data and reason against them to create GxP-compliant outputs is going to help us to bring life-changing cancer therapies to patients faster while maintaining the highest standards of quality. We see tremendous potential for Claude to power AI applications across several major functions at our company.”

Hisham Hamadeh, Senior Vice President, Global Head of Data, Digital and AI

“AI in R&D only works through an ecosystem. Anthropic is doing this right, bringing together the best technologies while putting access, governance, and interoperability first. Benchling is uniquely positioned to contribute. For more than a decade, scientists have trusted us as the source of truth for experimental data and to modernize their workflows. Now we're building AI that powers this next chapter of R&D.”

Ashu Singhal, Co-founder and President

“Broad Institute scientists pursue the most ambitious questions in biology and medicine, and we create and share tools to help empower scientists everywhere. We’ve been working closely with Manifold on the next generation of the Terra.bio platform—Terra Powered by Manifold. Among the most exciting of these upgrades are AI agents built on Claude that enable scientists to carry out tasks at an entirely new scale and efficiency and explore scientific domains in previously impossible ways.”

Heather Jankins, Head of Data Science Platform

“Accessing 10x’s single cell and spatial analysis capabilities has traditionally required computational expertise - from writing command-line scripts to managing high-performance computing systems. Now, these same tools can respond to questions asked in plain English. Using Claude, researchers can now perform common analytical tasks—including aligning reads, generating Feature Barcode matrices, performing clustering and other secondary analysis—through a conversational interface that complements traditional computational workflows, making it faster and easier for researchers to engage directly with their data. Claude lowers the barrier to entry for new users and scales to meet the needs of large-scale analyses for advanced research teams.”

Serge Saxonov, Co-founder and CEO

“Claude has been an invaluable progress multiplier for Axiom as we build AI to predict drug toxicity. We’ve used billions of tokens in Claude Code, and use it to write many of our PRs. More recently, Claude agents with MCP servers have become core tools for our scientific work. With the right MCPs, Claude agents can directly query databases and storage services to interpret, transform, and test correlations in data, and help us identify what data and features are most useful for predicting clinical drug toxicity.”

Prompt

My colleagues recently published the attached single-cell dataset that describes gene expression differences between adult and pediatric liver samples with a focus on the immune system. I would like to explore these samples but focus on the parenchymal cells and differences between adult and pediatric liver. Can you help me first go through the differentially expressed genes and create a heatmap and then also identify pathways or sets of genes that are enriched in each sample?

* Read(qc\_metrics\_after\_filtering.png)↳ Read image (1.1MB)
* Perfect! I've successfully completed the QC analysis on your raw feature matrix using the scRNA-qc skill. Here's a summary of the results:QC Analysis SummaryDataset: 2,700 cells × 32,738 genes (raw)Quality Metrics Detected:
  + 13 mitochondrial genes
  + 106 ribosomal genes
  + 13 hemoglobin genesMAD-Based Filtering Thresholds:
  + Total counts: 709 - 6,812
  + Genes detected: 367 - 1,821
  + Mitochondrial %: MAD threshold 3.65%, Hard threshold 8.0%Filtering Results:
  + 266 cells removed as outliers (9.9%)
  + 2,434 cells retained (90.1%)
  + Gene filtering reduced from 32,738 to 9,487 genes (29.0%)Key Observations from Visualizations:
  1. Before Filtering: The data shows typical scRNA-seq quality with most cells having 1,000-2,000 counts and detecting 500-1,000 genes. Mitochondrial content is generally low (<5%), which is excellent.
  2. Thresholds: The MAD-based thresholds are permissive (5 MADs for counts/genes, 3 MADs for MT%), following scverse best practices to avoid over-filtering.
  3. After Filtering: The filtered dataset shows cleaner distributions with tighter clustering, lower mitochondrial content (mostly <3%), and good cell-gene correlation.Output Files Created:
  + raw\_feature\_bc\_matrix\_filtered.h5ad - Clean filtered dataset ready for downstream analysis
  + raw\_feature\_bc\_matrix\_with\_qc.h5ad - Original data with QC annotations
  + QC visualization PNGs (before/thresholds/after)The data quality looks excellent! You can now proceed with downstream analysis like normalization, dimensionality reduction, and clustering using the filtered dataset.
