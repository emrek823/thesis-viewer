### UT Southwestern Deal Progress

- Met CFO 3 weeks ago, had 4 conversations
- Agreed to pricing/ROI, said “send me the contract” on Friday
- Started scoping process, going through legal review
- Exceptionally fast sales cycle pull-through

### Product Demo Success & CFO Pain Point

- CFO hired financial analyst for every department (80 departments)
- Paying ~$150K per analyst = $12M total cost annually
- Key frustration: “All I’ve been asking for is average gross charge per wRVU for every service line and cannot get an answer”
- Product demo showed this capability with synthetic data
- Created “holy shit moment” - perfect client quote opportunity

### Revenue Opportunity & ROI Model

- Translucent pricing: $20K per department × 80 departments = $1.6M deal
- Massive cost savings for client vs current analyst model
- 1% improvement on $5B organization = $50M value
- CFO immediately understood ROI: “there’s no CFO who doesn’t believe in financial planning analysis”

### Market Positioning Updates

- Why now: AI enables non-super users to access financial analysis
- Healthcare financial analysts need 4 skills:
	- Healthcare domain knowledge
	- Financial expertise
	- Data engineering capabilities
	- Communication to operators
- Most organizations lack people with all 4 skills
- Platform built for operators (Oliver), not just finance directors (Frank)

### PR Strategy & Timeline

- NEA marketing team reached out to Axios yesterday
- Also contacted other publications
- Expecting at least 1 week timeline for feature
- Sequence: Axios feature → wire release → LinkedIn posts → website updates
- Additional targets: Becker’s, Fierce, Modern Healthcare
- Organic channels: Health Tech Nerds community, Out of Pocket newsletter
- Nikhil (Out of Pocket) has equity in Translucent through small investment

### Market Validation & References

- Rubicon’s evaluation: Translucent only logo in FP&A category
- Mitch at Rubicon called Translucent “company he’s most excited about”
- Strong LP feedback confirming market opportunity
- Consider focusing on large health systems vs smaller medical groups

### Action Items to Add to Memo

- Why now positioning
- ROI model with specifics
- Product anecdote from UT Southwestern
- Non-super user component for operators
