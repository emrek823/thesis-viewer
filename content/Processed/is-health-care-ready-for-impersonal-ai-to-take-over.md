A common medical procedure where artificial intelligence is beginning to make its presence felt is blood draws.

In China, and even in the United States at institutions such as Northwestern Medicine, health systems are beginning to explore robotic phlebotomists designed to locate veins and insert needles without human assistance.

The patient sits beside the device and places their arm on a sloped arm rest. After pressing start, a tourniquet tightens while infrared light, an alcohol spray and an AI-driven probe locates a vein, according to a Rutgers University article. The device then inserts a needle and collects blood, with about a 95% success rate for at least one device maker in a 2024 clinical trial.

Meghan Connolly, 20, a junior nursing major at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, says that a robot drawing blood overlooks an essential part of patient care.

“A robot may be able to find a vein, but it can’t calm a nervous patient down or explain what is happening and it may even mess up,” Connolly said.

“I am scared of needles and I know a lot of people who are. I think human reassurance is part of the job, and that can’t be done by a robot, you need a human.”

Connolly’s concerns highlight a central issue in healthcare: while AI may be able to perform technical tasks, it cannot replicate the judgment or empathy that human workers bring to patient care.

Dr. Sandeep Reddy, a professor of healthcare management at Queensland University of Technology in Australia, acknowledges the challenges that come with replicating human interaction, but notes that AI has been successful in other areas.

“In Japan and certain other parts of the world, robots are already being used as social companions for the elderly,” he said. “AI avatars and chatbots can provide emotional connection in other areas, so you could imagine a situation where robots with human-like features offer some social and emotional support in a clinical setting. But at the end of the day, it is still difficult to achieve the full human touch that patients rely on.”

Reddy said these systems rely on AI to interpret data, which can occasionally generate incorrect outputs, commonly known as AI hallucinations.

“It is early days to have completely automated robots,” he says. “There is a risk of hallucination, and in healthcare those errors can have serious consequences. We need a rigorous scientific evaluation process before introducing any fully automated, AI-enabled system.”

However, Sandeep adds that while AI carries inherent risks, its benefits can outweigh them in certain contexts. Sandeep said large language models — AI systems designed to understand and generate human language — should not be used for direct patient care, where errors could cause serious harm, but noted they can be helpful for lower-risk tasks such as documentation.

Schoene notes that AI documentation tools rely on precise input, and even minor errors can affect patient safety. She adds that these systems can misinterpret or neglect information, requiring extra time from physicians to review and correct records.

These challenges connect to a larger debate over efficiency. While AI is often marketed as a way to speed up care, Schoene says the reality is more complicated.

She said that in the past six to nine months, AI has not improved efficiency. Doctors often must return to correct notes or fill in missing information, which can actually increase workload. And routine procedures, such as blood draws, require clinicians to reassure anxious patients and respond in real time to their emotional cues, skills that, Schoene said, remain difficult to replicate through automation.

“I always think about when I call customer service and you blatantly know it is an AI agent and you get annoyed and you scream at it because it doesn’t understand you. Just imagine that in the healthcare setting where it is actually safety-critical,” Schoene says.

For students and early-career nurses, this human element is a foundation for nursing. Connolly reflects on her own training: “Learning how to calm patients, read their reactions, and respond with empathy is a huge part of what being a nurse is about.”
