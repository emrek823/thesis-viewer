Another 2 weeks to get GC over the line

Other firms, still just the 3rd conversation

We need to buy ourselves our time into next week

Negotiate with structure so we can bring others in anyway

By end of next week, both sides will have much more clarity. Thend ecide to run with TS (negotiated version) or someone else with more serious offer on the table

We’re a year into operations (or 6 months if shit hits the fan).

Break-even, revenue is a bit under $10M

Pull comps of OSH / MA plans

If we raise enough capital today, we can put shovels in the ground for 3-4 other centers and we’ll able to finance

4 centers and proven partnership and partner that has given us all the support we’ve required

Repliacbility of design, playbook, partnership. Duplicate everything

Marginal difference

Rank

Control - 1st

G&A expenses (beyond HC) - very materials

Can we do this with $10M? Sure

7.5M? Maybe not

Any eorr
