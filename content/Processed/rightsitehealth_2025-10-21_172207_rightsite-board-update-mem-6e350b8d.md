# Investor Update - September 2025

## September Overview
### Overview
• September's Net Revenue/Episode shortfall came in at $66 versus a goal of $189, with
most of the shortfall from delayed payer contracting.
• The Diversions/Day shortfall came from lower call volumes, mainly from overestimated
call volume in Fort Worth and weaker performance at Grady, both of which were
diagnosed and corrected by quarter-end. We also had a shortfall in Diversion %,
attributed to the large number of newly onboarded physicians, whose diversion rate
climbs the first few months of service as they become more familiar with telehealth
care.
• Patient Care Cost/Episode dropped $10 from August as call volume rose in September.
But Patient Care Cost but remains $92 above forecast, driven by physician overstaffing
linked to the Fort Worth overestimate. Increasing call volume remains the key lever to
absorb excess Care Team capacity and reduce cost per episode.
• Employee Net Promoter Score held strong at 93, showing continued engagement and
team satisfaction.
• The table below summarizes September and Q3 performance.

## Finance
Gross Profit missed forecast due to delayed payor contracts, lower call volume, and new
physician credentialing delays (resulting in some Care Team shifts staffed with "unbillable"
physicians). Adjusted SG&A met forecast. Note we have attached September Financials in the
email with this update.
## Sales
Payor sales focused (but not exclusively) on BCBS-TX, United, and Molina, our top revenue
drivers for Q4. BCBS-TX contract is in final redlines, and the last step before execution is for
them to load the contract into their payment system. United-TX is finalizing its analysis, and
continues track on agreed upon milestones, while Molina is now live and paying claims. Paul
McBride joined the team as our SME network consultant and has been a very effective
contributor to plan sales strategy and as a participant in sales calls.
EMS sales remain strong as we move to a hunter-farmer model to better manage growth.
Hunters sell new EMS partnerships, while farmers account manage agency call volume
performance. Also, instead of using publicly available data to forecast EMS volume, we will
now require new EMS partners to share their historical call data before implementation. This
helps the Care Team staff physicians and navigators with greater accuracy, and gives “farmer”
account managers better insight to compare EMS-identified RightSite-eligible calls with actual
referrals. Using our change management framework, this will help each agency reach its full
potential.
## Q4 Company Priorities
The Company Priorities are set for Q4 and listed below. These have been cascaded to each
employee as their customized list of priorities, rolling back up to support the Company's Q4
goals. For Q4, we are pausing EMS growth in Florida until Q1 due to the political situation in
Jacksonville, and refocusing Florida resources on Georgia and Texas growth.

The tables below show monthly call volume targets for Q4 that with the May Forecast. The first
table includes Florida, whose projected launch has shifted to 2026. The second table reflects
volumes without Florida. The May Forecast also assumed weekend coverage beginning in
December 2025, which we've now deferred to 2026. The lost volume has only a minor revenue
impact in Q4.

## Payor Sales Update
Our payor strategy advanced meaningfully in Q3, driven by an improved sales process that
resolves common financial and contracting hurdles earlier, avoiding delays later in the cycle.
We refined our value proposition to focus on “units of cost” saved-specifically, Avoidable
Ambulance Transports and Avoided ER/Hospital Admissions—and now negotiate separate
case rates for each. This approach covers nearly all RightSite patient volume, as 93% of cases
avoid ambulance transport and 70% avoid an ER/hospital visit. For payors, it simplifies value
measurement and contract administration. For RightSite, it increases overall case rate revenue,
reduces denials, and avoids member balance billing.
We are transitioning from manual case rate invoicing to a fully auto-adjudicated billing process.
This change simplifies administration, reduces dependence on payor staffing and budget
cycles, and makes revenue more predictable. The setup takes longer (Molina required about
90 days, and BCBS-TX expects to load the contract by December 2025), but the result is
greater program stability, higher revenue per activation, and faster payment once live.
Another key learning this quarter was that many payors use narrow internal code sets to define
preventable ED visits. These codes capture far fewer eligible members than the population
RightSite actually treats. When payors run analyses using their own codes, they underestimate
both eligible volume and savings, which slows contracting. To fix this, we created a proprietary
RightSite eligibility code set that we now share early with medical economics teams to guide
their analysis and avoid undercounting the program's impact.
Strategic consulting investments have accelerated payor decision-maker access and reduced
friction in key accounts:
• Billy Milwee – Centene (Superior CEO) and Texas county-based Medicaid plans
• Paul McBride – Aetna Georgia market leadership, helping navigate corporate barriers
• Havarti Actuary – Development of intellectual property and eligibility frameworks
improving case rate valuation and health-plan outcomes
Our 2026 EMS network expansion and the anticipated increase in call volume are positively
pressuring payers in negotiations. We believe that continued expansion of our EMS network
will expedite deal closures and, once operational, provide the call volume savings our plans
expect.
Our main payor sales challenge is not closing the deals since the value proposition is strong
and no plan has disputed it, but predicting when they will close. BCBS Texas, United, and
Oscar have all validated our savings and moved into contracting, with execution expected in
2025. The timing remains unpredictable due to both executive sponsor turnover and internal
operational delays. For example, BCBS-TX is ready to sign but won't execute the contract until
its engineering team loads our contracts into their claims platform and their engineers have
a quarterly release cycle.

## Havarti Risk Analysis
Based on our nearly 20,000 patient encounters, our actuarial partner, Havarti, has completed
a new cost savings analysis for our payor sales process. We are finalizing outcomes data, but
early figures show a 39% rise in payor costs compared to our original model (from $4,456 to
$6,231), further increasing RightSite's economic value to payors and supporting higher case
rates in future negotiations and renewals.
Key drivers of the increase in the updated analysis include:
• Higher Cost of Care: The 2024 Medicare data used in the updated analysis shows
increased paid claim prices, greater frequency, and higher patient acuity compared to
the 2019 sample, making avoidable ER visits and Hospital admissions more expensive.
• RightSite Eligible Codes (Broader Definition of Eligible Avoidable ER Visits): With
over 20,000 RightSite episodes completed and analyzed, we now have a RightSite
Eligible Code Set that adds 362 codes to the baseline NYU codes. This expanded
code set adds a 12% increase to episode savings as RightSite captures more high-
cost, non-emergent cases.
## Deal Highlights
Here are some selected updates as of October 20th:
• BCBS-TX - We expect redlined amendments this week, targeting execution before
year-end and an effective date of January 1, 2026. The only delay is IT and claims
system readiness. We've begun settlement talks for 2025 volume and will meet with
CMO Dr. Mark Chassay and CEO Jim Springfield at the Texas Association of Health
Plans Conference (Nov 3–5). Our goal remains a >$1,000 case rate and Q4 activation.
• United - Texas negotiations remain on track. The CEO, CMO and SVP of Network
continue to champion RightSite. We shared the RightSite-Havarti expanded code set
on October 16 to increase the included codes to their previous analysis. Next, we'll
meet with the state plan sponsor and UHG sponsor to confirm the contracting path,
scheduled for October 29. We also advanced with WellMed, a full-risk Optum Provider
group. Nisha Patterson, SVP Optum Care Delivery is supportive and scheduled a
follow-up with Dr. Dan Frank, WellMed's CMO, and Circadian, an HC9 portfolio
company with a strong Wellmed relationship.
• Oscar - After identifying new program sponsors, and reminding them about our
previously validated 350% ROI analysis, the team is validating the prior analysis against
our new expanded code sets before formal contracting. With these strong internal
champions, we expect progress soon.
• Aetna - ABH-TX approved RightSite's Texas Medicaid extension and entered
contracting, with redlines expected this week. The new model replaces fee-for-service
telehealth rates with a case rate for “avoided ambulance” encounters, roughly equal in
frequency to the FFS telehealth claims, but priced higher. Aetna agreed to $310 per
avoided ambulance and $775 per avoided ER/hospital admission.

• Elevance Health - Both Virginia and Georgia markets continue to move forward, but
we expect timelines to extend into early 2026. Georgia leadership recently re-engaged
requesting a path to contracting in 2025, but their original analysis will need to be
negotiated to support a viable case rate. Our new expanded code set will be tested
here with Havarti's assistance.
• Centene - Through Billy Milwee Associates (former head of Texas HHSC/Medicaid), we
are connecting with Superior's new CEO, Mitch Wadsen, and coordinating with Equality
Health, their largest sub-cap provider, before our November 2 meeting at TAHP.
## ER Walk-In Service Line
We are close to launch. We have an MVP workflow with University Health (UH) ER leadership,
agreed on a simple Epic-to-RightSite Connect data interface that eliminates double entry, and
credentialed our physicians as UH staff. The contract is in near-final redline, pending a few
minor points and agreement on UH's uninsured rate for RightSite intervention.
We have begun amending existing health plan contracts to add coverage for ER walk-in
patients, a new concept for most payors. We don't expect pushback since these plans already
cover EMS diversion, but if a plan declines, we won't intervene in the ER, but rather send their
on through the ER. We'll track that avoidable ER use and use the data to re-engage those
plans as avoidable ER costs mount.
## Government Relations
We met directly with Medicaid leadership in Florida (AHCA), Georgia (DHS), and Texas (HHSC).
Each meeting achieved its goal of strengthening state-level alignment and support for
RightSite's work with Medicaid populations.

## EMS Update
September EMS call volume came in below forecast, with activations down 15% and
diversions down 25% versus the May forecast. Texas performed relatively well, up 3% in
activations and down 6% in diversions. Most of the shortfall came from Georgia (Grady) and
Florida. Although Grady improved by quarter's end, the lower call volume increased the fixed
cost burden of Care Team staffing.
### What Happened
• Forecasting: We built Fort Worth call volume projections from public EMS data instead
of agency-sourced data, which overstated non-emergent calls by about 2x, and caused
Care Team overstaffing of physicians and navigators.
• EMS Readiness: Fort Worth's merger of MedStar EMS people and process into the Fort
Worth Fire/Police dispatch center at the same time of RightSite's activation created
change fatigue and delayed adoption.
• Dispatch Training: At Grady, high dispatcher turnover left 40% of new Grady hires
without RightSite training until mid-quarter, which limited call transfers. With our focus
on new EMS sales, we were late to catch the high turnover, and therefore late to train
these new Grady dispatchers.
### What We're Doing
• We are requiring all new, larger EMS partners to give us agency-sourced call data
before implementation, so call volume forecasts and Care Team staffing are more
accurate and we can provide consistent performance metrics based on their
operational data.
• The EMS sales team is improving its discovery process to include a readiness
assessment to flag operational risks before launch, and we've dedicated personnel to
existing accounts to ensure a more consistent approach to account management.
• We improved training and adoption tracking to improve dispatch performance after go-
live. In fact, at Grady, call volume for September is up, and continues to improve in
October.
• We launched Operation Easy Button to reduce the time dispatch medics spend on
each call, improving their experience and increasing RightSite referrals. Future
initiatives will test white-labeled versions of our service to reduce patient confusion and
lower refusal rates.

## Care Team Operations
Operational metrics remain on track overall, though Patient Care Cost/Episode in September
was $334 versus a target of $242. The variance was driven mainly by physician overstaffing
tied to overestimated Fort Worth call volume and lower EMS call volume.
The Care Team continues to improve efficiency while maintaining quality and patient
experience. Key initiatives include:
• Operation Free Rider (aka "you can't use my Netflix password anymore") – A multi-
department effort to redirect plan members whose payors have not yet signed case
rate amendments. These patients will go directly to the ER via rideshare rather than
ambulance, preserving the value created for EMS partners while avoiding
uncompensated volume.
• Prescription Pathway – Our first RN joined the Care Team to manage e-prescribing
and same-day clinical questions, reducing physician time on task. She is also building a
formulary of generic and OTC medications for our Care Team to lower costs within
case rate bundles.
• Updated Scheduling Platform – A new scheduling tool improves efficiency in
physician and navigator staffing.
• Credentialing Process Improvements – We identified missed billing opportunities
when physicians were scheduled for shifts while licensed but not fully credentialed.
We're improving the complicated credentialing process to optimize for our physicians
being credentialed and billable for their shifts, while scheduling fully credentialed
physicians in our busier shifts.
• Billable Follow-Up Calls – We're now capturing physician telehealth visits completed
after the diversion day but within the seven-day service window, allowing us to bill for
those telehealth calls.
• MediDrive – We implemented MediDrive to compare real-time rates across Uber, Lyft,
and other providers, selecting the lowest-cost rideshare for each patient. This ensures
safe, reliable, and cost-efficient transportation and reduces rideshare cost per trip.
• Pharmacy Partnerships – We held our first meeting with a statewide retail pharmacy
chain to automate e-prescribing, OTC, and DME fulfillment, including delivery and
payment processes, improving both efficiency and patient access.

## Engineering
In Q3, the Engineering team was focused predominantly on moving our new reporting platform
into production and extending the capabilities of our billing system processes to allow for more
efficient and accurate billing for our services. The Sigma Computing reporting solution is
already providing us with some capabilities we were lacking, allowing our internal reporting
teams to be much more efficient in supporting our growing number of customers. In addition,
we remained focused on identifying and resolving inefficiencies for our Care Team, including
better access to work to be completed, streamlined data entry procedures and more.
Looking forward to Q4, the team is concentrating on improving Care Team efficiency where it
can make a direct impact on cost and revenue. We're implementing a new workflow for
Prescription Assistance activities, hoping to reduce the amount of time it takes our navigators
and physicians to handle routine prescriptions. We're continuing to expand our use of Al, this
time focused on the generation of clinical notes for audio-only telehealth calls and automatic
interaction summaries currently created manually by our navigators. These two automations
should significantly reduce the amount of time spent per episode. Lastly, we're designing
some new features to provide increased visibility into our larger operational teams, helping
everyone to see where each patient is in the workflow and who is assigned to their care.
