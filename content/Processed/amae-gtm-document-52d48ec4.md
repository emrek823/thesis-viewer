#### Overall Goal

1-2 contracts - payer or provider contracts that provide basis for scale with Series A capital. To get there, we need to speak with 50+ total (<5% hit rate)

#### Guidelines (or could be “what we don’t compromise on”)

Never charge Provider

Payers - focused on HEDIS, MLR, personal

First pitch with no pitch deck

Other

#### Pipeline + Status (Nov 16, 2022)

Gant chart, CRM, table, whatever it is - we need updates

Conversion funnel

#### Next Steps (Nov 16, 2022)

Based on current conversations and lessons learned, we need to target W payers and X providers with Y characteristics in Z states over the next 3 months.

Here is how we are identifying these customers or individual stakeholders

Medicaid RFPs coming up, lack of SMI providers in geo, recent initiatives (e.g., NYC), etc

We need help getting in touch with these folks
