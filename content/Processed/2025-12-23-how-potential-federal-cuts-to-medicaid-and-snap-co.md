### Abstract

* **Issue**: States are facing deep cuts in federal funding for Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), as envisioned by a U.S. House of Representatives budget resolution. These could include $880 billion in Medicaid cuts and $230 billion in SNAP cuts over 10 years.
* **Goal**: To estimate the impact of broad-based funding reductions in Medicaid and SNAP for all 50 states and the District of Columbia, assuming that cuts would be distributed evenly over the decade and proportionally across states.
* **Methods**: The IMPLAN economic modeling system was used to project the effects on state economies, employment, and taxes.
* **Key Findings and Conclusions**: Combined losses from proposed Medicaid and SNAP cuts would reach $1.1 trillion over a decade, including a $95 billion loss of federal funding in 2026 alone. State gross domestic products (GDPs) would be $113 billion lower, exceeding federal budget savings. About 1.03 million jobs would be lost nationwide in health care, food-related industries, and other sectors. State and local governments would lose $8.8 billion in state and local tax revenues. Not extending the enhanced health insurance premium tax credits that are scheduled to expire after December 2025 would lead to an additional 286,000 jobs lost in 2026, for a combined total of more than 1.3 million jobs lost in the United States.

## Introduction

Congress is considering a joint resolution to set federal budget targets for the next 10 years. Although the actual policies will need to be specified in subsequent legislation, the U.S. House of Representatives budget resolution calls for cutting at least $880 billion over the next decade for programs under the jurisdiction of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and at least $230 billion for programs under the House Agriculture Committee. The principal entitlement programs under these committees are Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly the Food Stamp Program), which indicates that these two programs are the principal targets for budget cutbacks.

The combined cuts represent a more than $1.1 trillion loss of services that millions of low-income Americans rely upon. The Senate budget resolution is less specific; it mentions cuts of at least $1 billion, although it would permit deeper cuts.

While Congressional consideration of budget proposals usually focuses on the effects on federal spending and the federal deficit, a fundamental question is: *How will these cuts affect states in which Medicaid and SNAP benefits are received?*[1](#footnote1)

Reports by other analysts have illustrated possible implications of Medicaid and SNAP proposals, such as cutting the number of program participants or slashing their health benefits or food-purchasing power.[2](#footnote2) These find that program cuts could jeopardize people’s health, increase hunger, and exacerbate hardships for millions of families, including those with children, pregnant women, seniors, and people with disabilities.

Our analysis examines a different issue: how the proposed federal policy changes will affect state economies. Table 1 summarizes the impact on employment for the nation, for the five largest states, and for five other states selected from across the country. We present our complete findings later in this brief and in the accompanying [data tables](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/sites/default/files/2025-05/Ku_impact_medicaid_snap_cuts_Tables_final.pdf), which contain impact results for all 50 states and the District of Columbia.

### How Cuts to Medicaid and SNAP Can Harm State Economies

While Medicaid is a health insurance program jointly administered by the federal government and the states, about two-thirds of funding for state Medicaid programs is federal. Medicaid is the largest source of federal funding for states.[3](#footnote3) SNAP nutrition benefits, meanwhile, are funded solely by the federal government.[4](#footnote4) As explained below, cutting hundreds of billions of dollars in federal funding for Medicaid and SNAP will necessarily weaken states’ economies and result in substantial job losses through a “multiplier effect.”

Although Medicaid and SNAP provide vital health coverage and food assistance to impoverished Americans, the direct recipients of Medicaid payments and SNAP benefits are health care providers — hospitals, doctors’ offices, pharmacies, and nursing homes, among others — as well as grocery and other food stores. Cuts in federal funding for Medicaid and SNAP shrink revenue for those businesses and their employees, and the effects ripple across other businesses and workers in their supply chains, such as medical equipment suppliers, food producers, and farms.

The affected businesses are forced to respond by reducing staffing, salaries, or purchases of other goods and services. As employees lose their jobs or income, they must reduce their spending on consumer goods and services, like food, housing, and transportation. This also lowers how much state and local governments can collect in taxes, including sales, income, and property taxes.

### Specific Budget Cut Policies Are Not Clear Yet

Since we won’t know the specific parameters of any federal funding cuts to Medicaid and SNAP until the budget reconciliation legislation advances in Congress, our preliminary analysis looks instead at the impact of *broad-based* funding reductions. Our goal is to understand the general size and scope of the economic repercussions of Medicaid and SNAP funding cuts. We assume the cuts are distributed evenly over the decade and proportionally across states.

In late January, the House Budget Committee released a document that listed more than 20 options for Medicaid cuts and a dozen for SNAP cuts.[5](#footnote5) Following are just a few examples:

* eliminating enhanced federal funding for state coverage of low-income, working-age adults who were made eligible for Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act (ACA)
* reducing SNAP benefits by canceling a 2021 update to the Thrifty Food Plan
* imposing work requirements on nonelderly adult Medicaid beneficiaries
* expanding work requirements in SNAP
* preventing states from using health care provider taxes to generate funding for the state share of Medicaid spending
* imposing per beneficiary caps on federal Medicaid spending, like a block grant.

Preliminary analyses of some of these options have already been released.[6](#footnote6) We plan to conduct economic assessments of more specific proposals as they become clearer. Some proposals, such as reducing SNAP allotments by eliminating a 2021 update for the Thrifty Food Plan (which is used to set maximum benefit levels), would affect every state and its residents.[7](#footnote7) Other policy proposals would differ across states. For example, eliminating the ACA federal funding enhancement for working-age adults would affect the 40 states that, along with the District of Columbia, expanded Medicaid eligibility but not the 10 states that have not done so. (It should be noted that states that have not expanded Medicaid have already lost tens of billions of dollars in potential federal funding by failing to opt into the expansion.[8](#footnote8))

## Key Findings from Our Impact Analysis

Below we present a summary of the economic, employment, and budget impacts of Medicaid and SNAP cuts across the United States, assuming there are broad-based cuts that are spread proportionately across all states and evenly over the decade. Detailed findings on these impacts for all 50 states and the District of Columbia are available in the accompanying [data tables](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/sites/default/files/2025-05/Ku_impact_medicaid_snap_cuts_Tables_final.pdf). Using IMPLAN, an economic modeling program widely used by analysts, we calculated the losses to states’ economies, the number of jobs that would be lost in each state, and the potential drop-off in state and local tax revenues, triggered by the loss of individual and business incomes in the states. (See “[How We Conducted This Study](#methods)” for a full explanation of study methods.)

### Impact of Federal Cuts to Medicaid

If Medicaid funding is cut by $880 billion over 10 years,[9](#footnote9) the amount that all states receive from the federal government would be 11.8 percent less than what they would get without any cuts. If cuts are evenly spread across the decade, $72.4 billion in funding would disappear nationwide in 2026, and losses would rise over the remainder of the decade. Detailed results for all 50 states and the District of Columbia are shown in [Table 2](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/sites/default/files/2025-05/Ku_impact_medicaid_snap_cuts_Tables_final.pdf#page=2).

The impact on state economies would be greater than the loss of federal Medicaid funding. This is because of the ripple effect of the cuts across the sectors of each state’s economy. We estimate that collectively, states’ gross domestic products (GDPs) would be about $95 billion smaller, and the total economic output lost would be even deeper ($157 billion). The average state’s reduction in its GDP for 2026 would be $1.9 billion.

Nationwide, about 888,000 jobs would be lost
