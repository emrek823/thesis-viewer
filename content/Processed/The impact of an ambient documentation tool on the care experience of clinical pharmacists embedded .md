## Abstract

Purpose. Ambient Documentation Tools (ADT) are an emerging technology designed to help clinicians complete documentation better with less time and effort. This study aimed to understand the impact of ADT on the pharmacist care experience. Methods. Data from Epic Signal, surveys, and interviews were collected between February 2024 and October 2025 from 41 medication therapy disease management (MTDM) pharmacists across 33 primary care and subspecialty clinics at a large integrated health system who were given ADT licenses. Study variables included pharmacist ADT utilization rate and pre-/post- changes in time spent in notes per encounter, as well as perceptions of documentation burden, patient access, undivided attention for patients, afterhours documentation, and burnout. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, regression models, and comparative tests of pre-/post-statistical significance and effect size. Qualitative data were mined for exemplary excerpts to deepen understanding. Results. Thirty pharmacists from 28 clinics utilized ADT and provided usable responses. ADT was utilized for 65% of eligible encounters, and the average time in notes per encounter fell 86 seconds post-ADT. Pharmacist perceptions of documentation burden, undivided attention ability, and afterhours documentation improved post-ADT. Interview responses were largely positive for most variables and revealed multiple explanatory mechanisms. Conclusion. ADT meaningfully improved several care experience aspects for MTDM pharmacists over a short period of time (2-7 months). Future research with larger samples and longer time horizons across multiple health systems is needed to investigate the full and sustained impact of ADT on the care experience.
