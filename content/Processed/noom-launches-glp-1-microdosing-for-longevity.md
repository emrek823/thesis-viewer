Noom Enters Longevity Medicine

Long-term lock-in.

Noom

Noom is making longevity medicine habitual.

What’s happening: The digital health company unveiled a diagnostics-driven microdosed GLP-1 program to preempt and reverse chronic disease — completing its evolution from diet app to full-stack preventative health platform.

New Noom. Reprogramming Noom’s existing AI-based microhabits app and prescription weight loss drug microdosing platform, Proactive Health Microdose introduces at-home diagnostics to measure performance over time.

Using microneedle Tasso+ blood draw technology, users will track metabolic, cardiovascular, and hormonal—plus inflammation and nutrient markers—health quarterly.

Long game. With effectiveness beyond diabetes and obesity, Noom is leveraging Big Pharma’s declaration of GLP-1s as longevity medicine—while prescribing minimal effective doses—to normalize the treatment and supercharge its platform’s outcomes.

In the same vein, competitor Hims & Hers acquired microneedle diagnostics company YourBio Health to advance longevity and life stage medicine.

Looking ahead: A convergence of mega-trends, peptides, longevity, and blood diagnostics are part and parcel to the next era of consumer care.
