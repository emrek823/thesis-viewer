## Slide 9: Not a dashboard. Not a consultant. An AI Financial Analyst with endless use cases.

*   **Physician Productivity**
    *   Automating weekly physician productivity reports, shared with every operator across the enterprise + chat-based querying and analysis on the data

*   **Dept. & Service-Line P&L**
    *   Automating Monthly P&L analysis and review for every service line operator + chat-based querying and analysis on the data

*   **Physician Compensation**
    *   Automating physician compensation P&L / summaries + chat-based querying and analysis for physicians and operators

*   **Contract Analysis**
    *   Ingest, analyze, summarize strategic financial insights from payer, vendor, pharmacy contracts for operators (in chat-based platform)

*   **Workforce FTE / Overtime Planning**
    *   Automate scenario planning with financial workforce staffing data for all operators in a chat-based platform

## Slide 10: Value to working with us vs. building internally

There are a few things that make our AI special and easy-to-use...

*   **Data Model** | We build the translation layer for AI to easily work with your data, so you don't have to
    *   Example: Significant manual effort to connect ChatGPT to you underlying Financial Data in a way that it knows how to read and analyze it like a P&L (i.e., general ledger data)

*   **Business Logic** | We train our AI on your business logic, LLMs don't know the right rules to follow
    *   Example: ChatGPT doesn't know how an organization specifically calculates wRVUs

*   **Performance** | We run significant evaluation on AI outputs and test / select the best models
    *   Example: ChatGPT may not be as effective at answering physician productivity questions as Gemini

*   **Functionality** | We're building beyond chat to support report automation, dashboards, and more
    *   Example: ChatGPT has one form-factor, chat-based interactions. It is not able to easily manage and maintain complex automated reports, show consistent dashboards. It's not build for this workflow.

## Slide 11: Value to You and Your Teams

**OPERATIONAL LEADERS**
**Confidently Run Your Business**
*   The answers they need, precisely when they need it

**FINANCE / DATA TEAMS**
**Produce More Insights, Faster**
*   Reduce your manual report generation, handling of ad-hoc requests
*   24/7 coverage for finance, operations, c-suite leaders
*   More bandwidth for high-value strategic work
