## Gen­er­al Cat­a­lyst-backed Ra­di­al rais­es $50M to treat men­tal health in non-tra­di­tion­al ways

Ra­di­al, a start­up pur­su­ing new­er ways to treat men­tal health us­ing brain stim­u­la­tion and fast-act­ing med­ica­tions, just raised $50 mil­lion in Se­ries A and seed fund­ing, *End­points News* learned ex­clu­sive­ly.

The com­pa­ny runs both soft­ware and in-per­son clin­ics to treat men­tal health con­di­tions like de­pres­sion us­ing neu­ro­mod­u­la­tion, which could mean ap­ply­ing elec­tric or mag­net­ic stim­u­la­tion di­rect­ly to the brain, as well as treat­ments like nasal spray Spra­va­to. That’s com­pared to more tra­di­tion­al meth­ods, such as psy­chother­a­py and pre­scrib­ing an­ti­de­pres­sants.

Ra­di­al is bet­ting that these non-tra­di­tion­al but sci­en­tif­i­cal­ly sup­port­ed meth­ods, which are now in­creas­ing­ly cov­ered by in­sur­ance, will be­come more main­stream in the near fu­ture, CEO and co-founder John Capece­la­tro told End­points. The hope is to treat pa­tients for whom oth­er treat­ments have not worked, and to be a place where pa­tients can try out dif­fer­ent op­tions rather than be­ing a clin­ic that of­fers one type, he said.

“In places where you see some forms of this care, it’s typ­i­cal­ly very siloed,” Capece­la­tro said. “It’s very chal­leng­ing for the con­sumer who might not re­spond to one of these treat­ments and might need to try an­oth­er, or still an­oth­er, to go to a place that has tru­ly the best ex­pe­ri­ence end-to-end across this en­tire cat­e­go­ry of treat­ment.”

Capece­la­tro, a for­mer Pill­Pack em­ploy­ee, found­ed Ra­di­al in 2023 with Pill­Pack founder El­liot Co­hen, as well as psy­chi­a­trists Car­lene MacMil­lan and Owen Muir. In­vestors in its Se­ries A and seed rounds in­clude Gen­er­al Cat­a­lyst, So­lari Cap­i­tal, JSL Health Cap­i­tal, Founder Col­lec­tive, Box­Group, Scrub Cap­i­tal and dig­i­tal health start­up Com­mure co-founder Diede van Lam­oen.

In­sur­ers’ re­im­burse­ment for the treat­ments them­selves, many of which are re­quired to be in per­son, is high enough to en­able the clin­ics to run prof­itably, Capece­la­tro said. Ra­di­al will use the ven­ture fund­ing to build out more clin­ics. It cur­rent­ly op­er­ates sev­en clin­ics across six states, in­clud­ing New York and South Car­oli­na.

Be­yond de­liv­er­ing the treat­ments, Ra­di­al has al­so de­vel­oped soft­ware and tools that sup­port clin­i­cians with de­ci­sion mak­ing, help pa­tients bet­ter un­der­stand what’s cov­ered and nav­i­gate the com­plex re­im­burse­ment en­vi­ron­ment, among oth­er things. The longer-term goal is to sell its soft­ware to oth­er clin­ics look­ing to of­fer sim­i­lar treat­ment op­tions in the fu­ture, as well as ad­di­tion­al treat­ment op­tions.

“Psy­chi­a­try writ large is shift­ing in this di­rec­tion of pro­vid­ing re­al­ly mod­ern, ef­fec­tive brain med­i­cine,” Capece­la­tro said. “This is what psy­chi­a­try will look like over the next decade or two.”
