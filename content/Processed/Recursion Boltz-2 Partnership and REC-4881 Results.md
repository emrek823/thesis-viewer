## Clinical Validation

**REC-4881 Results (December 2025):**
- Positive Phase 1b/2 results for Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP)
- Meaningful polyp burden reductions
- Manageable safety profile
- J.P. Morgan upgraded company after results

**What This Means:**
First major clinical validation that Recursion's AI-driven approach produces real drug candidates that work.

## Foundation Models

**Phenom Family:**
Turns microscopic cellular images into meaningful biological representations. BioHive-1 trained Phenom-1 using 3.5 billion cellular images.

**MolE:**
Molecular foundation model adapting DeBERTa architecture to molecular graphs. Two-step pretraining: self-supervised on chemical structures + massive multi-task learning for biological information.

## Boltz-2 Partnership

**Key Development:**
MIT's Regina Barzilay launched Boltz-2 with Recursion insights - uniting protein folding and small-molecule binding affinity prediction.

**Recursion Results:**
Getting better results since replacing Boltz-1 with Boltz-2 for:
- Virtual screening
- Hit identification
- Lead optimization

## Data Moat

**65 Petabytes:**
- Phenomics
- Transcriptomics
- InVivomics
- Proteomics
- ADME data
- De-identified patient data

**BioHive-2 Supercomputer:**
504 NVIDIA H100 GPUs, 2 exaflops AI performance, 5x faster than first-generation.

## Relevance to JEPA Thesis

**Recursion represents the "data moat" counter-thesis:**

1. Their differentiation isn't architecture - it's 65PB of proprietary phenomics data
2. They use commodity models (Boltz-2) but get better results because of data
3. Clinical validation (REC-4881) proves the approach works

**Key question for thesis:**
Is the moat in the architecture (JEPA vs LLM) or in the data (65PB phenomics vs public datasets)?

Recursion suggests data matters more than architecture. But their data is on cells, not clinical outcomes. The JEPA thesis may still hold for trajectory prediction even if Recursion wins on drug discovery.

**Consider adding:** Recursion as example of "data moat beats architecture moat" in drug discovery, while world model approach may still win in clinical decision support where Epic has the data moat.
