# A: LTPAC and Chronic Health

## Client
Hi, thanks for taking the time. For some context, I am looking at a company, Charta, in the chart review space, and you guys are currently in a POC with them. I would love to maybe just start with hearing a bit about your background, PAM Health and how you guys got introduced to Charta and a little bit about the POC.

## Expert
What specifically?

## Client
We can start with, what at PAM Health made you guys look for a solution like Charta?

## Expert
I think really, from our perspective, one of the things we realized is that on the revenue cycle time process, the typical standard is you send a claim out, the claim goes to the clearinghouse, ultimately gets accepted or denied, and then you have to rework it and there's delay, there's lag, and you can't review 100% of all your claims.

You can do spot checks and things of that nature, but imagine if you had a tool that you could do a pre-bill analysis of what you're sending out to determine on the front end if it's going to have a high degree of success making it through the ultimate payment and reducing turnaround time, denial rates, and ultimately, improving cash flow. For us, that was the rationale to do it.

## Client
Got you. When you're doing the POC with Charta, did you guys also look at other products in the space?

## Expert
We did, and I think I found Charta to be the most advanced, and actually met with their CEO and folks, and see how they did their operation to know where they're at and how they're projected for future.

## Client
Got you. Which other products did you guys look at?

## Expert
The ones you had listed.

## Client
Just Brellium and SmarterDx?

## Expert
That's it.

## Client
Yeah, I would love to hear the more detailed breakdown between what.

## Expert
I think the biggest piece, as mentioned, is we want something that's pre-bill review, and that the AI is based on workflow and current understanding of payer rules because you have to design it for your specific payer contracts. It's got to be something that can be easily adapted, the tool. Something that the rulemaking

## Text Transcription

the physician office space. They're doing really good in developing ambulatory capabilities. When you say ambulatory capabilities, I think they can expand into every space that has a claims submission-based issue.

If you think about why they developed their organization, they developed the organization, they were looking at what problems needed solving, and they recognized RCM was a problem that needed solving, then there was a lot of lanes within that space. As they perfect and they gain success in the ones that they are in, I think it lends to a couple places. I think about, it can get into infusion, it can get into home health, it can get into the outpatient surgery spaces.

I think there's a lot of lanes for it, but right now, they're probably focused on the things that A) will give them the biggest packet, and then what are synergistic. If you think of Kaiser, and Kaiser has a lot of different avenues that would lend them to get expertise and have scale and then compete with, or not so much compete. If they can get a Kaiser health system, a Kaiser, then plan, imagine being able to offer their services in reverse to payers to predict how they can be better at ensuring their prior authorizations.

I think there's a payer angle here that they can do. I just think it's probably going to be a later offering once they build continued success where they're at. Great, you're helping me, as a provider, get through better results on my claim submissions, but I can also see on the payer side, "Hey, these providers are getting really good at their first-time pass. How do we reverse engineer now to be able to know how we can ensure our authorization systems are better, to capture nuances that maybe we're not picking up?"

**Client**
That makes sense. In terms of how you guys think about what you'd be willing to pay for a chart review solution, how do you think about what makes sense there?

**Expert**
I think chart review is one thing. I think the standard has been, "Oh, we'll take 10% of certain claims and things of that nature," and you do a statistical snapshot, but the complexities of your contracts are so different at every state that we operate in every market, within a state that we operate, and the different contractual terms that we have to have, just doing randomized spot checks isn't going to be enough, but you also don't want to get an external agency that all they do is a lot of manual chart review process because then you're getting to human error and they can't review as many charts. Imagine being able to do 100% of your chart reviews through an AI tool.

**Client**
That makes a lot of sense. You mentioned there was a six-week setup process. How would you break down the different parts of that timeline, like the contracting, testing, go live? Just want to get a better sense of what that looks like.

**Expert**
Yeah. I think the biz terms, and getting through that initial piece, I felt that was fairly quick as you know it, but the first piece, of course, was understanding the scope, "What are we asking and what does our business model look like and what are the claim types that we're going to feed through the system and the payers?"

They need to have a little bit of due diligence to be able to understand, "How do we model for your entity?" We were rather new for them, looking at it differently, non-physician office, so to speak. In doing that, it opened up their eyes like, "Oh, guess what?" We also use them for reviewing we have our wound center claims which looks different.

I just think that there's more utility there. For us, the first period of time, and I don't count the contracting review as part of the six weeks. For me, the six weeks is once you get the terms, once you get to understanding what the scope of work is and they've done their assessment of what our ask is, then I think it's the six weeks of "All right, it's going to be about two and a half weeks to three weeks of developing the rules." It's going to be some dry runs. It's going to be some testing, and then specific work groups in content areas.

If it's outpatient therapy, having PTs, OTs, and speech, understanding what are the rules that are aligned with their types of bill submissions because they have different rules. It could be a timed rule, it can be a session rule, it can be a treatment rule, and really understanding what are the things that they need to incorporate into the rules so that when we process the claim it does it.

## Client
Got you. What week are you guys into your POC?

## Expert
We are about three months into it.

## Client
Got you. The six-week setup, that was prior to the POC?

## Expert
Yes.

## Client
Got you. How's the POC going after three months?

## Expert
That's going good. That's where we're starting to see some initial positivity on our reduction time, in terms of the denials, and we're starting to see how we can adjust our rules to be a little broader and not be so narrow, everything's not coming back. We've identified fixes on our end.

## Client
Makes sense. Jumping back to the earlier point, I know we talked about Brellium versus Charta, we'd love to hear more about your thoughts on SmarterDx because they are the oldest player in this space, and I think there's been some maybe PE consolidations where they've joined up with other parts of.

## Expert
Yeah. Think of it as in terms of an Epic and an Oracle. Epic was built ground up. It's a particular tool type. Oracle is multiple tools that they're trying to seamlessly integrate together and to be more full suite of capabilities. I think I look at Charta as an Epic, and that their goal is to really streamline the physician burden on the administrative process. I didn't meet with the SmarterDx CEO. I think he's got a physician background, so he's looking at it from that lens. I think there's something there. We didn't do a lot of due diligence with them, given that we just recognized that they weren't there yet.

## Client
That makes sense. A lot of these companies that have been around for a long time don't necessarily build the best product either.

## Expert
Yeah.

## Client
Yeah. Anything else you think I should have asked to understand Charta's positioning in this market?

## Expert
What I would say in terms of their positioning, I think they have multiple pathways that they can do, but they're going to be smart. They're going to focus on the areas that they can build some really good strength and gain market adoption. I think they've identified, and rightly so, on the physician space is going to have a

**Client**
That makes a lot of sense. The market in general for chart review type tools, would you say it's a fairly large market?

**Expert**
Yes.

**Client**
Got you. What are the other software tools you guys use at PAM Health, AI or software?

**Expert**
I think we're all looking at our EMRs, what type of AI capability will be, to be able to do longitude assessments of our own data to make predictive insights, and then understand that "How can we take these insights and apply them at bedside?" Not only from an outcomes perspective, but guess what, that we can reduce expenses.

**Client**
Makes a lot of sense. You guys are, I think, paying around low six figures for Charta?

**Expert**
Yeah, we're in the low space right now because I think we're very tailored to how we're utilizing it right now. I think also because we were early. I'm sure if we were to try to redo this now, it'd be different. I think if we were to have to start off as a brand new customer like today, I'm sure the pricing would be different.

**Client**
That makes a lot of sense. Thank you so much for taking your time. It's super helpful.
