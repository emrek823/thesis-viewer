**Created:** 2025-12-17T20:00:41.143Z
**Updated:** 2025-12-17T20:28:18.948Z

### Company Background and Market Position

- Tomaz Berisa: Former GenCOV founder/CEO (8 years, through Series A)
	- Computer science/electrical engineering PhD background
	- 3 years at New York Genome Center developing low-pass sequencing tech
	- Licensed technology and spun out GenCOV with VC funding
- Core insight from GenCOV experience
	- Sequencing costs plateauing due to human labor costs
	- Even with free sequencing, low-pass genome still costs $20-30
	- Need “fractions of pennies” to accelerate life sciences development
- Vision Language Action Models breakthrough
	- Physical Intelligence leading with open-source models
	- Tesla and Google Gemini developments
	- Enables telling robots “what to do” not “how to do it”

### Technology Approach and Go-to-Market Strategy

- Service lab wedge strategy
	- Starting with whole genome sequencing ($400 current market vs $100 reagent cost)
	- Interface customers already understand: samples/money in, data out
	- Rule: no touching lab equipment by hand, only through robots
- Target customer segments ($50-500k annual spend)
	- Biotechs, biobanks, pharma teams
	- Medium-sized academic labs and hospital research teams
	- Director-level decision makers who can approve $100-200k without escalation
- Market positioning vs competitors
	- Avoiding specialized vertical integration approach of others
	- Full lab automation rather than single-pod solutions
	- Building foundation for potential cloud lab model

### Current Status and Funding

- Team: Tomaz + co-founder Jahan (former GenCOV lab manager, 3+ years working relationship)
- Timeline: Left GenCOV May 2024, full-time since August
- Funding status
	- SAFE from SOSV (moved into NYC lab space 2 weeks ago)
	- $1.3M remaining to raise of $1.6M target
	- Robots arrived 1 week ago, currently training models
- Hiring plans: Data science engineer in Q1-Q2, potentially lab tech
- Revenue model: Amazon analogy - build service lab first, then expand tooling/platform

### Next Steps

- Virtue to provide feedback by end of week/early next week
- Key areas for conviction building: go-to-market strategy and customer wedge approach
- Tomaz available through end of year for follow-ups

**Updated:** 2025-12-17T18:27:09.252Z

### PR Strategy Overview

- Target announcement: January 28th, leveraging post-JPMorgan quiet period
- Working with Command PR firm to secure exclusive coverage
- Bundle seed + Series A announcement with company launch
- Focus on brand credibility over direct audience reach
	- Want Gyde logo alongside Wall Street Journal, Axios, TechCrunch
	- Need shareable third-party validation for broker sales conversations
	- Establish category leadership positioning

### Target Outlets & Approach

- Traditional tier-1 business outlets
	- Wall Street Journal, Forbes, Fortune, Axios prioritized
	- Command has strong reporter relationships for pitching
- Venture/tech coverage for recruiting purposes
- Podcast appearances planned
	- TVPN, Sorcery for venture audience (15-30 min commitments)
	- Self-funded Broker podcast (generated most leads previously)
	- Lightspeed Investment Memo as follow-up content
- Owned channels launching: blog, LinkedIn (employee benefits), Facebook (Medicare), Instagram

### Audience Considerations

- Primary: Agency principals for go-to-market credibility
- Secondary: Engineers/technologists for recruiting
- Broker community responds to different credibility signals
	- Steve Young board position carries more weight than VC names
	- Endowment fund investors (like Vanderbilt) resonate over venture brands
	- Need to avoid detailed economics/multiples discussion in public forums
- Story angle: AI-enabled comprehensive guide positioning brokers as healthcare value chain leaders

### Next Steps

- Draft press release by December 30th for investor review
- Pitching begins early January
- Media package with assets/copy for investor amplification
- Continue dialogue on potential media introductions

## Tonic Discussion
**Granola ID:** a05c6e2b-d44e-43e3-96b0-e733ae72e6b2

**Updated:** 2025-12-17T16:33:29.393Z

### Tonic Demo and Product Overview

- AI workflow automation platform targeting business users
- <$1/workflow execution vs $1,000/year traditional subscriptions
- Natural language workflow creation in <10 minutes
- Document processing example: referral extraction, insurance info, human review
- Happy path focus initially - AI adds edge cases and failure states later
- Test run capability before full deployment
- CSV export or webhook integration options

### Technology Architecture - DFA Approach

- Uses Deterministic Finite Automata (DFAs) for workflow structure
- Key advantages over traditional AI agents:
	- Better consistency for repeated tasks (5-20x daily usage)
	- Natural language acceptance for evaluation sets
	- Static analysis capabilities for regression detection
	- Clear state separation vs complex hierarchical models
- Constraining AI to small, discrete tasks improves specificity
- 24-hour eval set testing using past runs for model regression monitoring

### VC Fund Strategy Discussion

- Virtue ahead of 4-year schedule by 2-3 years
- Strong Series A/B markups expected Q4 and Q1
- Three potential paths forward:

### Great Point Ventures Merger Analysis

- GPV has 150M raised, targeting 250M total with healthcare systems/payer relationships
- Would include incubation arm alongside investing
- Abhishek’s perspective: High status but lower expected returns
- 250M fund size makes equivalent multiples “way harder” to achieve
- Incubation component “mostly doomed to failure” without world-class builders
- Recommendation: Take middle path (75-85M) to maintain competitive positioning

### Investor Value Proposition Insights

- Check size capability most important factor
	- Ability to write full round removes fundraising friction
	- 40-50% round coverage still requires additional 2+ weeks of fundraising cycles
- Platform value expectations:
	- Healthcare investor network claims expected but rarely delivered effectively
	- Real value: Actual introductions to health system investment arms
	- Grunt work assistance (data sourcing, financial modeling) highly valued
- Signal Fire model praised for actual sweat equity contribution

### Next Steps

- Sean to consider 20-30M add-on to Fund 2 option
- Potential Tonic pilot discussion for Virtue workflows
- Follow-up on healthcare vertical vs horizontal intelligence thesis
- Abhishek targeting forced launch within 4 months

	- 3 years at New York Genome Center developing low-pass sequencing tech
	- Licensed technology and spun out GenCOV with VC funding
- Core insight from GenCOV experience
	- Sequencing costs plateauing due to human labor costs
	- Even with free sequencing, low-pass genome still costs $20-30
	- Need “fractions of pennies” to accelerate life sciences development
- Vision Language Action Models breakthrough
	- Physical Intelligence leading with open-source models
	- Tesla and Google Gemini developments
	- Enables telling robots “what to do” not “how to do it”

### Technology Approach and Go-to-Market Strategy

- Service lab wedge strategy
	- Starting with whole genome sequencing ($400 current market vs $100 reagent cost)
	- Interface customers already understand: samples/money in, data out
	- Rule: no touching lab equipment by hand, only through robots
- Target customer segments ($50-500k annual spend)
	- Biotechs, biobanks, pharma teams
	- Medium-sized academic labs and hospital research teams
	- Director-level decision makers who can approve $100-200k without escalation
- Market positioning vs competitors
	- Avoiding specialized vertical integration approach of others
	- Full lab automation rather than single-pod solutions
	- Building foundation for potential cloud lab model

### Current Status and Funding

- Team: Tomaz + co-founder Jahan (former GenCOV lab manager, 3+ years working relationship)
- Timeline: Left GenCOV May 2024, full-time since August
- Funding status
	- SAFE from SOSV (moved into NYC lab space 2 weeks ago)
	- $1.3M remaining to raise of $1.6M target
	- Robots arrived 1 week ago, currently training models
- Hiring plans: Data science engineer in Q1-Q2, potentially lab tech
- Revenue model: Amazon analogy - build service lab first, then expand tooling/platform

### Next Steps

- Virtue to provide feedback by end of week/early next week
- Key areas for conviction building: go-to-market strategy and customer wedge approach
- Tomaz available through end of year for follow-ups

### PR Strategy Overview

- Target announcement: January 28th, leveraging post-JPMorgan quiet period
- Working with Command PR firm to secure exclusive coverage
- Bundle seed + Series A announcement with company launch
- Focus on brand credibility over direct audience reach
	- Want Gyde logo alongside Wall Street Journal, Axios, TechCrunch
	- Need shareable third-party validation for broker sales conversations
	- Establish category leadership positioning

### Target Outlets & Approach

- Traditional tier-1 business outlets
	- Wall Street Journal, Forbes, Fortune, Axios prioritized
	- Command has strong reporter relationships for pitching
- Venture/tech coverage for recruiting purposes
- Podcast appearances planned
	- TVPN, Sorcery for venture audience (15-30 min commitments)
	- Self-funded Broker podcast (generated most leads previously)
	- Lightspeed Investment Memo as follow-up content
- Owned channels launching: blog, LinkedIn (employee benefits), Facebook (Medicare), Instagram

### Audience Considerations

- Primary: Agency principals for go-to-market credibility
- Secondary: Engineers/technologists for recruiting
- Broker community responds to different credibility signals
	- Steve Young board position carries more weight than VC names
	- Endowment fund investors (like Vanderbilt) resonate over venture brands
	- Need to avoid detailed economics/multiples discussion in public forums
- Story angle: AI-enabled comprehensive guide positioning brokers as healthcare value chain leaders

### Next Steps

- Draft press release by December 30th for investor review
- Pitching begins early January
- Media package with assets/copy for investor amplification
- Continue dialogue on potential media introductions

### Tonic Demo and Product Overview

- AI workflow automation platform targeting business users
- <$1/workflow execution vs $1,000/year traditional subscriptions
- Natural language workflow creation in <10 minutes
- Document processing example: referral extraction, insurance info, human review
- Happy path focus initially - AI adds edge cases and failure states later
- Test run capability before full deployment
- CSV export or webhook integration options

### Technology Architecture - DFA Approach

- Uses Deterministic Finite Automata (DFAs) for workflow structure
- Key advantages over traditional AI agents:
	- Better consistency for repeated tasks (5-20x daily usage)
	- Natural language acceptance for evaluation sets
	- Static analysis capabilities for regression detection
	- Clear state separation vs complex hierarchical models
- Constraining AI to small, discrete tasks improves specificity
- 24-hour eval set testing using past runs for model regression monitoring

### VC Fund Strategy Discussion

- Virtue ahead of 4-year schedule by 2-3 years
- Strong Series A/B markups expected Q4 and Q1
- Three potential paths forward:

### Great Point Ventures Merger Analysis

- GPV has 150M raised, targeting 250M total with healthcare systems/payer relationships
- Would include incubation arm alongside investing
- Abhishek’s perspective: High status but lower expected returns
- 250M fund size makes equivalent multiples “way harder” to achieve
- Incubation component “mostly doomed to failure” without world-class builders
- Recommendation: Take middle path (75-85M) to maintain competitive positioning

### Investor Value Proposition Insights

- Check size capability most important factor
	- Ability to write full round removes fundraising friction
	- 40-50% round coverage still requires additional 2+ weeks of fundraising cycles
- Platform value expectations:
	- Healthcare investor network claims expected but rarely delivered effectively
	- Real value: Actual introductions to health system investment arms
	- Grunt work assistance (data sourcing, financial modeling) highly valued
- Signal Fire model praised for actual sweat equity contribution

### Next Steps

- Sean to consider 20-30M add-on to Fund 2 option
- Potential Tonic pilot discussion for Virtue workflows
- Follow-up on healthcare vertical vs horizontal intelligence thesis
- Abhishek targeting forced launch within 4 months

	- Enables telling robots “what to do” not “how to do it”

### Technology Approach and Go-to-Market Strategy

- Service lab wedge strategy
	- Starting with whole genome sequencing ($400 current market vs $100 reagent cost)
	- Interface customers already understand: samples/money in, data out
	- Rule: no touching lab equipment by hand, only through robots
- Target customer segments ($50-500k annual spend)
	- Biotechs, biobanks, pharma teams
	- Medium-sized academic labs and hospital research teams
	- Director-level decision makers who can approve $100-200k without escalation
- Market positioning vs competitors
	- Avoiding specialized vertical integration approach of others
	- Full lab automation rather than single-pod solutions
	- Building foundation for potential cloud lab model

### Current Status and Funding

- Team: Tomaz + co-founder Jahan (former GenCOV lab manager, 3+ years working relationship)
- Timeline: Left GenCOV May 2024, full-time since August
- Funding status
	- SAFE from SOSV (moved into NYC lab space 2 weeks ago)
	- $1.3M remaining to raise of $1.6M target
	- Robots arrived 1 week ago, currently training models
- Hiring plans: Data science engineer in Q1-Q2, potentially lab tech
- Revenue model: Amazon analogy - build service lab first, then expand tooling/platform

### Next Steps

- Virtue to provide feedback by end of week/early next week
- Key areas for conviction building: go-to-market strategy and customer wedge approach
- Tomaz available through end of year for follow-ups

### PR Strategy Overview

- Target announcement: January 28th, leveraging post-JPMorgan quiet period
- Working with Command PR firm to secure exclusive coverage
- Bundle seed + Series A announcement with company launch
- Focus on brand credibility over direct audience reach
	- Want Gyde logo alongside Wall Street Journal, Axios, TechCrunch
	- Need shareable third-party validation for broker sales conversations
	- Establish category leadership positioning

### Target Outlets & Approach

- Traditional tier-1 business outlets
	- Wall Street Journal, Forbes, Fortune, Axios prioritized
	- Command has strong reporter relationships for pitching
- Venture/tech coverage for recruiting purposes
- Podcast appearances planned
	- TVPN, Sorcery for venture audience (15-30 min commitments)
	- Self-funded Broker podcast (generated most leads previously)
	- Lightspeed Investment Memo as follow-up content
- Owned channels launching: blog, LinkedIn (employee benefits), Facebook (Medicare), Instagram

### Audience Considerations

- Primary: Agency principals for go-to-market credibility
- Secondary: Engineers/technologists for recruiting
- Broker community responds to different credibility signals
	- Steve Young board position carries more weight than VC names
	- Endowment fund investors (like Vanderbilt) resonate over venture brands
	- Need to avoid detailed economics/multiples discussion in public forums
- Story angle: AI-enabled comprehensive guide positioning brokers as healthcare value chain leaders

### Next Steps

- Draft press release by December 30th for investor review
- Pitching begins early January
- Media package with assets/copy for investor amplification
- Continue dialogue on potential media introductions

### Tonic Demo and Product Overview

- AI workflow automation platform targeting business users
- <$1/workflow execution vs $1,000/year traditional subscriptions
- Natural language workflow creation in <10 minutes
- Document processing example: referral extraction, insurance info, human review
- Happy path focus initially - AI adds edge cases and failure states later
- Test run capability before full deployment
- CSV export or webhook integration options

### Technology Architecture - DFA Approach

- Uses Deterministic Finite Automata (DFAs) for workflow structure
- Key advantages over traditional AI agents:
	- Better consistency for repeated tasks (5-20x daily usage)
	- Natural language acceptance for evaluation sets
	- Static analysis capabilities for regression detection
	- Clear state separation vs complex hierarchical models
- Constraining AI to small, discrete tasks improves specificity
- 24-hour eval set testing using past runs for model regression monitoring

### VC Fund Strategy Discussion

- Virtue ahead of 4-year schedule by 2-3 years
- Strong Series A/B markups expected Q4 and Q1
- Three potential paths forward:

### Great Point Ventures Merger Analysis

- GPV has 150M raised, targeting 250M total with healthcare systems/payer relationships
- Would include incubation arm alongside investing
- Abhishek’s perspective: High status but lower expected returns
- 250M fund size makes equivalent multiples “way harder” to achieve
- Incubation component “mostly doomed to failure” without world-class builders
- Recommendation: Take middle path (75-85M) to maintain competitive positioning

### Investor Value Proposition Insights

- Check size capability most important factor
	- Ability to write full round removes fundraising friction
	- 40-50% round coverage still requires additional 2+ weeks of fundraising cycles
- Platform value expectations:
	- Healthcare investor network claims expected but rarely delivered effectively
	- Real value: Actual introductions to health system investment arms
	- Grunt work assistance (data sourcing, financial modeling) highly valued
- Signal Fire model praised for actual sweat equity contribution

### Next Steps

- Sean to consider 20-30M add-on to Fund 2 option
- Potential Tonic pilot discussion for Virtue workflows
- Follow-up on healthcare vertical vs horizontal intelligence thesis
- Abhishek targeting forced launch within 4 months

### PR Strategy Overview

- Target announcement: January 28th, leveraging post-JPMorgan quiet period
- Working with Command PR firm to secure exclusive coverage
- Bundle seed + Series A announcement with company launch
- Focus on brand credibility over direct audience reach
	- Want Gyde logo alongside Wall Street Journal, Axios, TechCrunch
	- Need shareable third-party validation for broker sales conversations
	- Establish category leadership positioning

### Target Outlets & Approach

- Traditional tier-1 business outlets
	- Wall Street Journal, Forbes, Fortune, Axios prioritized
	- Command has strong reporter relationships for pitching
- Venture/tech coverage for recruiting purposes
- Podcast appearances planned
	- TVPN, Sorcery for venture audience (15-30 min commitments)
	- Self-funded Broker podcast (generated most leads previously)
	- Lightspeed Investment Memo as follow-up content
- Owned channels launching: blog, LinkedIn (employee benefits), Facebook (Medicare), Instagram

### Audience Considerations

- Primary: Agency principals for go-to-market credibility
- Secondary: Engineers/technologists for recruiting
- Broker community responds to different credibility signals
	- Steve Young board position carries more weight than VC names
	- Endowment fund investors (like Vanderbilt) resonate over venture brands
	- Need to avoid detailed economics/multiples discussion in public forums
- Story angle: AI-enabled comprehensive guide positioning brokers as healthcare value chain leaders

### Next Steps

- Draft press release by December 30th for investor review
- Pitching begins early January
- Media package with assets/copy for investor amplification
- Continue dialogue on potential media introductions

### Tonic Demo and Product Overview

- AI workflow automation platform targeting business users
- <$1/workflow execution vs $1,000/year traditional subscriptions
- Natural language workflow creation in <10 minutes
- Document processing example: referral extraction, insurance info, human review
- Happy path focus initially - AI adds edge cases and failure states later
- Test run capability before full deployment
- CSV export or webhook integration options

### Technology Architecture - DFA Approach

- Uses Deterministic Finite Automata (DFAs) for workflow structure
- Key advantages over traditional AI agents:
	- Better consistency for repeated tasks (5-20x daily usage)
	- Natural language acceptance for evaluation sets
	- Static analysis capabilities for regression detection
	- Clear state separation vs complex hierarchical models
- Constraining AI to small, discrete tasks improves specificity
- 24-hour eval set testing using past runs for model regression monitoring

### VC Fund Strategy Discussion

- Virtue ahead of 4-year schedule by 2-3 years
- Strong Series A/B markups expected Q4 and Q1
- Three potential paths forward:

### Great Point Ventures Merger Analysis

- GPV has 150M raised, targeting 250M total with healthcare systems/payer relationships
- Would include incubation arm alongside investing
- Abhishek’s perspective: High status but lower expected returns
- 250M fund size makes equivalent multiples “way harder” to achieve
- Incubation component “mostly doomed to failure” without world-class builders
- Recommendation: Take middle path (75-85M) to maintain competitive positioning

### Investor Value Proposition Insights

- Check size capability most important factor
	- Ability to write full round removes fundraising friction
	- 40-50% round coverage still requires additional 2+ weeks of fundraising cycles
- Platform value expectations:
	- Healthcare investor network claims expected but rarely delivered effectively
	- Real value: Actual introductions to health system investment arms
	- Grunt work assistance (data sourcing, financial modeling) highly valued
- Signal Fire model praised for actual sweat equity contribution

### Next Steps

- Sean to consider 20-30M add-on to Fund 2 option
- Potential Tonic pilot discussion for Virtue workflows
- Follow-up on healthcare vertical vs horizontal intelligence thesis
- Abhishek targeting forced launch within 4 months

**Updated:** 2025-12-17T20:28:18.948Z

### Company Background and Market Position

- Tomaz Berisa: Former GenCOV founder/CEO (8 years, through Series A)
	- Computer science/electrical engineering PhD background
	- 3 years at New York Genome Center developing low-pass sequencing tech
	- Licensed technology and spun out GenCOV with VC funding
- Core insight from GenCOV experience
	- Sequencing costs plateauing due to human labor costs
	- Even with free sequencing, low-pass genome still costs $20-30
	- Need “fractions of pennies” to accelerate life sciences development
- Vision Language Action Models breakthrough
	- Physical Intelligence leading with open-source models
	- Tesla and Google Gemini developments
	- Enables telling robots “what to do” not “how to do it”

### Technology Approach and Go-to-Market Strategy

- Service lab wedge strategy
	- Starting with whole genome sequencing ($400 current market vs $100 reagent cost)
	- Interface customers already understand: samples/money in, data out
	- Rule: no touching lab equipment by hand, only through robots
- Target customer segments ($50-500k annual spend)
	- Biotechs, biobanks, pharma teams
	- Medium-sized academic labs and hospital research teams
	- Director-level decision makers who can approve $100-200k without escalation
- Market positioning vs competitors

### PR Strategy Overview

- Target announcement: January 28th, leveraging post-JPMorgan quiet period
- Working with Command PR firm to secure exclusive coverage
- Bundle seed + Series A announcement with company launch
- Focus on brand credibility over direct audience reach
	- Want Gyde logo alongside Wall Street Journal, Axios, TechCrunch
	- Need shareable third-party validation for broker sales conversations
	- Establish category leadership positioning

### Target Outlets & Approach

- Traditional tier-1 business outlets
	- Wall Street Journal, Forbes, Fortune, Axios prioritized
	- Command has strong reporter relationships for pitching
- Venture/tech coverage for recruiting purposes
- Podcast appearances planned
	- TVPN, Sorcery for venture audience (15-30 min commitments)
	- Self-funded Broker podcast (generated most leads previously)
	- Lightspeed Investment Memo as follow-up content
- Owned channels launching: blog, LinkedIn (employee benefits), Facebook (Medicare), Instagram

### Audience Considerations

- Primary: Agency principals for go-to-market credibility
- Secondary: Engineers/technologists for recruiting
- Broker community responds to different credibility signals
	- Steve Young board position carries more weight than VC names
	- Endowment fund investors (like Vanderbilt) resonate over venture brands
	- Need to avoid detailed economics/multiples discussion in public forums
- Story angle: AI-enabled comprehensive guide positioning brokers as healthcare value chain leaders

### Next Steps

- Draft press release by December 30th for investor review
- Pitching begins early January
- Media package with assets/copy for investor amplification
- Continue dialogue on potential media introductions

### Tonic Demo and Product Overview

- AI workflow automation platform targeting business users
- <$1/workflow execution vs $1,000/year traditional subscriptions
- Natural language workflow creation in <10 minutes
- Document processing example: referral extraction, insurance info, human review
- Happy path focus initially - AI adds edge cases and failure states later
- Test run capability before full deployment
- CSV export or webhook integration options

### Technology Architecture - DFA Approach

- Uses Deterministic Finite Automata (DFAs) for workflow structure
- Key advantages over traditional AI agents:
	- Better consistency for repeated tasks (5-20x daily usage)
	- Natural language acceptance for evaluation sets
	- Static analysis capabilities for regression detection
	- Clear state separation vs complex hierarchical models
- Constraining AI to small, discrete tasks improves specificity
- 24-hour eval set testing using past runs for model regression monitoring

### VC Fund Strategy Discussion

- Virtue ahead of 4-year schedule by 2-3 years
- Strong Series A/B markups expected Q4 and Q1
- Three potential paths forward:

### Great Point Ventures Merger Analysis

- GPV has 150M raised, targeting 250M total with healthcare systems/payer relationships
- Would include incubation arm alongside investing
- Abhishek’s perspective: High status but lower expected returns
- 250M fund size makes equivalent multiples “way harder” to achieve
- Incubation component “mostly doomed to failure” without world-class builders
- Recommendation: Take middle path (75-85M) to maintain competitive positioning

### Investor Value Proposition Insights

- Check size capability most important factor
	- Ability to write full round removes fundraising friction
	- 40-50% round coverage still requires additional 2+ weeks of fundraising cycles
- Platform value expectations:
	- Healthcare investor network claims expected but rarely delivered effectively
	- Real value: Actual introductions to health system investment arms
	- Grunt work assistance (data sourcing, financial modeling) highly valued
- Signal Fire model praised for actual sweat equity contribution

### Next Steps

- Sean to consider 20-30M add-on to Fund 2 option
- Potential Tonic pilot discussion for Virtue workflows
- Follow-up on healthcare vertical vs horizontal intelligence thesis
- Abhishek targeting forced launch within 4 months

## Virtue and Tomaz Berisa
**Granola ID:** 75c0f890-1c89-4b49-bd6f-7644780eeeb6
**Created:** 2025-12-17T20:00:41.143Z
**Updated:** 2025-12-17T20:28:18.948Z

### Company Background and Market Position

- Tomaz Berisa: Former GenCOV founder/CEO (8 years, through Series A)
	- Computer science/electrical engineering PhD background
	- 3 years at New York Genome Center developing low-pass sequencing tech
	- Licensed technology and spun out GenCOV with VC funding
- Core insight from GenCOV experience
	- Sequencing costs plateauing due to human labor costs
	- Even with free sequencing, low-pass genome still costs $20-30
	- Need “fractions of pennies” to accelerate life sciences development
- Vision Language Action Models breakthrough
	- Physical Intelligence leading with open-source models
	- Tesla and Google Gemini developments
	- Enables telling robots “what to do” not “how to do it”

### Technology Approach and Go-to-Market Strategy

- Service lab wedge strategy
	- Starting with whole genome sequencing ($400 current market vs $100 reagent cost)
	- Interface customers already understand: samples/money in, data out
	- Rule: no touching lab equipment by hand, only through robots
- Target customer segments ($50-500k annual spend)
	- Biotechs, biobanks, pharma teams
	- Medium-sized academic labs and hospital research teams
	- Director-level decision makers who can approve $100-200k without escalation
- Market positioning vs competitors
	- Avoiding specialized vertical integration approach of others
	- Full lab automation rather than single-pod solutions
	- Building foundation for potential cloud lab model

### Current Status and Funding

- Team: Tomaz + co-founder Jahan (former GenCOV lab manager, 3+ years working relationship)
- Timeline: Left GenCOV May 2024, full-time since August
- Funding status
	- SAFE from SOSV (moved into NYC lab space 2 weeks ago)

### PR Strategy Overview

- Target announcement: January 28th, leveraging post-JPMorgan quiet period
- Working with Command PR firm to secure exclusive coverage
- Bundle seed + Series A announcement with company launch
- Focus on brand credibility over direct audience reach
	- Want Gyde logo alongside Wall Street Journal, Axios, TechCrunch
	- Need shareable third-party validation for broker sales conversations
	- Establish category leadership positioning

### Target Outlets & Approach

- Traditional tier-1 business outlets
	- Wall Street Journal, Forbes, Fortune, Axios prioritized
	- Command has strong reporter relationships for pitching
- Venture/tech coverage for recruiting purposes
- Podcast appearances planned
	- TVPN, Sorcery for venture audience (15-30 min commitments)
	- Self-funded Broker podcast (generated most leads previously)
	- Lightspeed Investment Memo as follow-up content
- Owned channels launching: blog, LinkedIn (employee benefits), Facebook (Medicare), Instagram

### Audience Considerations

- Primary: Agency principals for go-to-market credibility
- Secondary: Engineers/technologists for recruiting
- Broker community responds to different credibility signals
	- Steve Young board position carries more weight than VC names
	- Endowment fund investors (like Vanderbilt) resonate over venture brands
	- Need to avoid detailed economics/multiples discussion in public forums
- Story angle: AI-enabled comprehensive guide positioning brokers as healthcare value chain leaders

### Next Steps

- Draft press release by December 30th for investor review
- Pitching begins early January
- Media package with assets/copy for investor amplification
- Continue dialogue on potential media introductions

### Tonic Demo and Product Overview

- AI workflow automation platform targeting business users
- <$1/workflow execution vs $1,000/year traditional subscriptions
- Natural language workflow creation in <10 minutes
- Document processing example: referral extraction, insurance info, human review
- Happy path focus initially - AI adds edge cases and failure states later
- Test run capability before full deployment
- CSV export or webhook integration options

### Technology Architecture - DFA Approach

- Uses Deterministic Finite Automata (DFAs) for workflow structure
- Key advantages over traditional AI agents:
	- Better consistency for repeated tasks (5-20x daily usage)
	- Natural language acceptance for evaluation sets
	- Static analysis capabilities for regression detection
	- Clear state separation vs complex hierarchical models
- Constraining AI to small, discrete tasks improves specificity
- 24-hour eval set testing using past runs for model regression monitoring

### VC Fund Strategy Discussion

- Virtue ahead of 4-year schedule by 2-3 years
- Strong Series A/B markups expected Q4 and Q1
- Three potential paths forward:

### Great Point Ventures Merger Analysis

- GPV has 150M raised, targeting 250M total with healthcare systems/payer relationships
- Would include incubation arm alongside investing
- Abhishek’s perspective: High status but lower expected returns
- 250M fund size makes equivalent multiples “way harder” to achieve
- Incubation component “mostly doomed to failure” without world-class builders
- Recommendation: Take middle path (75-85M) to maintain competitive positioning

### Investor Value Proposition Insights

- Check size capability most important factor
	- Ability to write full round removes fundraising friction
	- 40-50% round coverage still requires additional 2+ weeks of fundraising cycles
- Platform value expectations:
	- Healthcare investor network claims expected but rarely delivered effectively
	- Real value: Actual introductions to health system investment arms
	- Grunt work assistance (data sourcing, financial modeling) highly valued
- Signal Fire model praised for actual sweat equity contribution

### Next Steps

- Sean to consider 20-30M add-on to Fund 2 option
- Potential Tonic pilot discussion for Virtue workflows
- Follow-up on healthcare vertical vs horizontal intelligence thesis
- Abhishek targeting forced launch within 4 months

## Virtue and Tomaz Berisa
**Granola ID:** 75c0f890-1c89-4b49-bd6f-7644780eeeb6
**Created:** 2025-12-17T20:00:41.143Z
**Updated:** 2025-12-17T20:28:18.948Z

### Company Background and Market Position

- Tomaz Berisa: Former GenCOV founder/CEO (8 years, through Series A)
	- Computer science/electrical engineering PhD background
	- 3 years at New York Genome Center developing low-pass sequencing tech
	- Licensed technology and spun out GenCOV with VC funding
- Core insight from GenCOV experience
	- Sequencing costs plateauing due to human labor costs
	- Even with free sequencing, low-pass genome still costs $20-30
	- Need “fractions of pennies” to accelerate life sciences development
- Vision Language Action Models breakthrough
	- Physical Intelligence leading with open-source models
	- Tesla and Google Gemini developments
	- Enables telling robots “what to do” not “how to do it”

### Technology Approach and Go-to-Market Strategy

- Service lab wedge strategy
	- Starting with whole genome sequencing ($400 current market vs $100 reagent cost)
	- Interface customers already understand: samples/money in, data out
	- Rule: no touching lab equipment by hand, only through robots
- Target customer segments ($50-500k annual spend)
	- Biotechs, biobanks, pharma teams
	- Medium-sized academic labs and hospital research teams
	- Director-level decision makers who can approve $100-200k without escalation
- Market positioning vs competitors
	- Avoiding specialized vertical integration approach of others
	- Full lab automation rather than single-pod solutions
	- Building foundation for potential cloud lab model

### Current Status and Funding

- Team: Tomaz + co-founder Jahan (former GenCOV lab manager, 3+ years working relationship)
- Timeline: Left GenCOV May 2024, full-time since August
- Funding status
	- SAFE from SOSV (moved into NYC lab space 2 weeks ago)
	- $1.3M remaining to raise of $1.6M target
	- Robots arrived 1 week ago, currently training models
- Hiring plans: Data science engineer in Q1-Q2, potentially lab tech
- Revenue model: Amazon analogy - build service lab first, then expand tooling/platform

### Next Steps

- Virtue to provide feedback by end of week/early next week
- Key areas for conviction building: go-to-market strategy and customer wedge approach
- Tomaz available through end of year for follow-ups

### PR Strategy Overview

- Target announcement: January 28th, leveraging post-JPMorgan quiet period
- Working with Command PR firm to secure exclusive coverage
- Bundle seed + Series A announcement with company launch
- Focus on brand credibility over direct audience reach
	- Want Gyde logo alongside Wall Street Journal, Axios, TechCrunch
	- Need shareable third-party validation for broker sales conversations
	- Establish category leadership positioning

### Target Outlets & Approach

- Traditional tier-1 business outlets
	- Wall Street Journal, Forbes, Fortune, Axios prioritized
	- Command has strong reporter relationships for pitching
- Venture/tech coverage for recruiting purposes
- Podcast appearances planned
	- TVPN, Sorcery for venture audience (15-30 min commitments)
	- Self-funded Broker podcast (generated most leads previously)
	- Lightspeed Investment Memo as follow-up content
- Owned channels launching: blog, LinkedIn (employee benefits), Facebook (Medicare), Instagram

### Audience Considerations

- Primary: Agency principals for go-to-market credibility
- Secondary: Engineers/technologists for recruiting
- Broker community responds to different credibility signals
	- Steve Young board position carries more weight than VC names
	- Endowment fund investors (like Vanderbilt) resonate over venture brands
	- Need to avoid detailed economics/multiples discussion in public forums
- Story angle: AI-enabled comprehensive guide positioning brokers as healthcare value chain leaders

### Next Steps

- Draft press release by December 30th for investor review
- Pitching begins early January
- Media package with assets/copy for investor amplification
- Continue dialogue on potential media introductions

### Tonic Demo and Product Overview

- AI workflow automation platform targeting business users
- <$1/workflow execution vs $1,000/year traditional subscriptions
- Natural language workflow creation in <10 minutes
- Document processing example: referral extraction, insurance info, human review
- Happy path focus initially - AI adds edge cases and failure states later
- Test run capability before full deployment
- CSV export or webhook integration options

### Technology Architecture - DFA Approach

- Uses Deterministic Finite Automata (DFAs) for workflow structure
- Key advantages over traditional AI agents:
	- Better consistency for repeated tasks (5-20x daily usage)
	- Natural language acceptance for evaluation sets
	- Static analysis capabilities for regression detection
	- Clear state separation vs complex hierarchical models
- Constraining AI to small, discrete tasks improves specificity
- 24-hour eval set testing using past runs for model regression monitoring

### VC Fund Strategy Discussion

- Virtue ahead of 4-year schedule by 2-3 years
- Strong Series A/B markups expected Q4 and Q1
- Three potential paths forward:

### Great Point Ventures Merger Analysis

- GPV has 150M raised, targeting 250M total with healthcare systems/payer relationships
- Would include incubation arm alongside investing
- Abhishek’s perspective: High status but lower expected returns
- 250M fund size makes equivalent multiples “way harder” to achieve
- Incubation component “mostly doomed to failure” without world-class builders
- Recommendation: Take middle path (75-85M) to maintain competitive positioning

### Investor Value Proposition Insights

- Check size capability most important factor
	- Ability to write full round removes fundraising friction
	- 40-50% round coverage still requires additional 2+ weeks of fundraising cycles
- Platform value expectations:
	- Healthcare investor network claims expected but rarely delivered effectively
	- Real value: Actual introductions to health system investment arms
	- Grunt work assistance (data sourcing, financial modeling) highly valued
- Signal Fire model praised for actual sweat equity contribution

### Next Steps

- Sean to consider 20-30M add-on to Fund 2 option
- Potential Tonic pilot discussion for Virtue workflows
- Follow-up on healthcare vertical vs horizontal intelligence thesis
- Abhishek targeting forced launch within 4 months

## Virtue and Tomaz Berisa
**Granola ID:** 75c0f890-1c89-4b49-bd6f-7644780eeeb6
**Created:** 2025-12-17T20:00:41.143Z
**Updated:** 2025-12-17T20:28:18.948Z

### Company Background and Market Position

- Tomaz Berisa: Former GenCOV founder/CEO (8 years, through Series A)
	- Computer science/electrical engineering PhD background
	- 3 years at New York Genome Center developing low-pass sequencing tech
	- Licensed technology and spun out GenCOV with VC funding
- Core insight from GenCOV experience
	- Sequencing costs plateauing due to human labor costs
	- Even with free sequencing, low-pass genome still costs $20-30
	- Need “fractions of pennies” to accelerate life sciences development
- Vision Language Action Models breakthrough
	- Physical Intelligence leading with open-source models
	- Tesla and Google Gemini developments
	- Enables telling robots “what to do” not “how to do it”

### Technology Approach and Go-to-Market Strategy

- Service lab wedge strategy
	- Starting with whole genome sequencing ($400 current market vs $100 reagent cost)
	- Interface customers already understand: samples/money in, data out
	- Rule: no touching lab equipment by hand, only through robots
- Target customer segments ($50-500k annual spend)
	- Biotechs, biobanks, pharma teams
	- Medium-sized academic labs and hospital research teams
	- Director-level decision makers who can approve $100-200k without escalation
- Market positioning vs competitors
	- Avoiding specialized vertical integration approach of others
	- Full lab automation rather than single-pod solutions
	- Building foundation for potential cloud lab model

### Current Status and Funding

- Team: Tomaz + co-founder Jahan (former GenCOV lab manager, 3+ years working relationship)
- Timeline: Left GenCOV May 2024, full-time since August
- Funding status
	- SAFE from SOSV (moved into NYC lab space 2 weeks ago)
	- $1.3M remaining to raise of $1.6M target
	- Robots arrived 1 week ago, currently training models
- Hiring plans: Data science engineer in Q1-Q2, potentially lab tech
- Revenue model: Amazon analogy - build service lab first, then expand tooling/platform

### Next Steps

- Virtue to provide feedback by end of week/early next week
- Key areas for conviction building: go-to-market strategy and customer wedge approach
- Tomaz available through end of year for follow-ups

## Tonic Discussion
**Granola ID:** a05c6e2b-d44e-43e3-96b0-e733ae72e6b2

**Updated:** 2025-12-17T16:33:29.393Z

### Tonic Demo and Product Overview

- AI workflow automation platform targeting business users
- <$1/workflow execution vs $1,000/year traditional subscriptions
- Natural language workflow creation in <10 minutes
- Document processing example: referral extraction, insurance info, human review
- Happy path focus initially - AI adds edge cases and failure states later
- Test run capability before full deployment
- CSV export or webhook integration options

### Technology Architecture - DFA Approach

- Uses Deterministic Finite Automata (DFAs) for workflow structure
- Key advantages over traditional AI agents:
	- Better consistency for repeated tasks (5-20x daily usage)
	- Natural language acceptance for evaluation sets
	- Static analysis capabilities for regression detection
	- Clear state separation vs complex hierarchical models
- Constraining AI to small, discrete tasks improves specificity
- 24-hour eval set testing using past runs for model regression monitoring

### VC Fund Strategy Discussion

- Virtue ahead of 4-year schedule by 2-3 years
- Strong Series A/B markups expected Q4 and Q1
- Three potential paths forward:

### Great Point Ventures Merger Analysis

- GPV has 150M raised, targeting 250M total with healthcare systems/payer relationships
- Would include incubation arm alongside investing
- Abhishek’s perspective: High status but lower expected returns
- 250M fund size makes equivalent multiples “way harder” to achieve
- Incubation component “mostly doomed to failure” without world-class builders
- Recommendation: Take middle path (75-85M) to maintain competitive positioning

### Investor Value Proposition Insights

- Check size capability most important factor
	- Ability to write full round removes fundraising friction
	- 40-50% round coverage still requires additional 2+ weeks of fundraising cycles
- Platform value expectations:
	- Healthcare investor network claims expected but rarely delivered effectively
	- Real value: Actual introductions to health system investment arms
	- Grunt work assistance (data sourcing, financial modeling) highly valued
- Signal Fire model praised for actual sweat equity contribution

### Next Steps

- Sean to consider 20-30M add-on to Fund 2 option
- Potential Tonic pilot discussion for Virtue workflows
- Follow-up on healthcare vertical vs horizontal intelligence thesis
- Abhishek targeting forced launch within 4 months

## Virtue and Tomaz Berisa
**Granola ID:** 75c0f890-1c89-4b49-bd6f-7644780eeeb6
**Created:** 2025-12-17T20:00:41.143Z
**Updated:** 2025-12-17T20:28:18.948Z

### Company Background and Market Position

- Tomaz Berisa: Former GenCOV founder/CEO (8 years, through Series A)
	- Computer science/electrical engineering PhD background
	- 3 years at New York Genome Center developing low-pass sequencing tech
	- Licensed technology and spun out GenCOV with VC funding
- Core insight from GenCOV experience
	- Sequencing costs plateauing due to human labor costs
	- Even with free sequencing, low-pass genome still costs $20-30
	- Need “fractions of pennies” to accelerate life sciences development
- Vision Language Action Models breakthrough
	- Physical Intelligence leading with open-source models
	- Tesla and Google Gemini developments
	- Enables telling robots “what to do” not “how to do it”

### Technology Approach and Go-to-Market Strategy

- Service lab wedge strategy
	- Starting with whole genome sequencing ($400 current market vs $100 reagent cost)
	- Interface customers already understand: samples/money in, data out
	- Rule: no touching lab equipment by hand, only through robots
- Target customer segments ($50-500k annual spend)
	- Biotechs, biobanks, pharma teams
	- Medium-sized academic labs and hospital research teams
	- Director-level decision makers who can approve $100-200k without escalation
- Market positioning vs competitors
	- Avoiding specialized vertical integration approach of others
	- Full lab automation rather than single-pod solutions
	- Building foundation for potential cloud lab model

### Current Status and Funding

- Team: Tomaz + co-founder Jahan (former GenCOV lab manager, 3+ years working relationship)
- Timeline: Left GenCOV May 2024, full-time since August
- Funding status
	- SAFE from SOSV (moved into NYC lab space 2 weeks ago)
	- $1.3M remaining to raise of $1.6M target
	- Robots arrived 1 week ago, currently training models
- Hiring plans: Data science engineer in Q1-Q2, potentially lab tech
- Revenue model: Amazon analogy - build service lab first, then expand tooling/platform

### Next Steps

- Virtue to provide feedback by end of week/early next week
- Key areas for conviction building: go-to-market strategy and customer wedge approach
- Tomaz available through end of year for follow-ups
