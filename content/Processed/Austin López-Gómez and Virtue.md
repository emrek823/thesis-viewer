### Product Overview

- Patient readiness platform with two core components:
	- Omnichannel data ingestion
	- Monitoring
- SaaS solution embeds into EMR allowing hospitals to run their playbooks
- Most hospitals don’t perform risk assessments themselves
- Platform connects to HIE networks for data access
- Currently at $650K ARR (blend of SaaS and clinical business)
- Push data into customized risk assessment algorithms based on hospital playbooks

### Data & Technology

- Three key data types provide most value:
	- Assessments (often hidden in free text)
	- Conditions
	- Medications
- Omnichannel ingestion includes:
	- Automated faxing and email requests for medical records
	- Auto-signing patient release forms
	- OCR processing of unstructured data
	- Converting to CCDA document format

### Patient Journey

- Two primary entry points:
	- When patient is scheduled (through EMR data feed)
	- When surgery schedulers register patients on platform
- Surgery schedulers are power users - platform automates their manual tasks:
	- Medical record assembly
	- Doctor office communications
	- Last three notes collection

### Key Customer: UT Health San Antonio

	- Automated triggers via surgery schedule
	- Deep integration with scheduler offices
- Already exploring expansion into:
	- Oncology care
	- Specialty clinics
- Delivering similar volumes at 20% of cost vs other UT hospitals

### Growth & Future Direction

	- Kidney transplants (early DaVita discussions)
	- Oncology
- Next 6 months roadmap includes:
	- Voice agents
	- Automated phone calls
	- Focus on deterministic automation
