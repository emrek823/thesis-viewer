### Current Affinity MCP Server Setup & Enhancement Plans

- Currently using open source MCP server (composio) with limited functionality
	- Only reads ~5 API endpoints
	- Can retrieve company/person data but lacks write capabilities
	- Missing: note creation, file upload/retrieval functions
- Ben confirmed straightforward to add missing tools using existing API endpoints
	- Notes API, Files API, other endpoints available in documentation
	- Should enable write-back functionality Emre needs
- Official Affinity MCP server planned for Q4 2024
	- Will include broader API coverage plus new query capabilities
	- Designed for common VC use cases (weekly prep, meeting context, summaries)

### Emre’s AI Workflow Strategy & Use Cases

- Three primary workflow areas being developed:
	- Portfolio reporting (historical/future-looking)
		- Weekly portfolio company updates and monitoring
		- Calendar integration for upcoming meetings
	- Deal pipeline management
		- First meeting prep using Affinity data
		- Sector analysis and note generation for pitch preparation
	- Insight generation/knowledge base
		- Weekly synthesis from Slack channels, newsletters, links
		- Topic categorization across 20 healthcare market areas
		- Building searchable knowledge graph over time
- Current tech stack: Claude + MCP servers (Gmail, Calendar, Google Drive, Granola transcripts)
- Budget allocation trend: $150k AI tools budget replacing associate hire (multiple funds adopting similar approach)

### Affinity Product Roadmap & Beta Opportunities

- AI notetaking tool with transcript API
	- Will provide standardized transcript access vs current Granola local cache workaround
	- Note summaries available today via API, raw transcripts coming later
- LinkedIn integration beta
	- CSV upload for network mapping
	- Semantic search over network connections
	- Early POC: chat interface for “do I know X at Y company” queries
- AI-powered field generation
	- Natural language rules to auto-populate custom fields
	- Use case: automatic market tagging based on company descriptions
	- Leveraging improved company description data quality
- Custom Files team connection
	- Ben to introduce Emre to BCI (British Columbia Investments) dev team
	- They built open source Affinity MCP server with more extensive functionality
	- Opportunity for collaboration and shared development
