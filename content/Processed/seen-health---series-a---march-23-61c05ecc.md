## Slide 2: Who We Are

**WHO WE ARE**

We empower **seniors** to age-in-place with dignity and provide their **families** peace of mind.

## Slide 3: Market Context

**MARKET CONTEXT**

Our immigrant parents prepared us for life's challenges, but no one prepared us to care for them as they grow old

**Parents & Grandparents**
*   Value long term relationships
*   Prefer to age at home
*   Seek familiar and local

**Common Challenges**
*   Linguistically isolated
*   Value holistic AND western medicine
*   Struggle to access appropriate care

**= Deferred Care**
**Unfortunate Outcomes**
"Wait 3 months for an appointment to see the provider who speaks their language" ¹

**Children & Family**
*   Want seniors to be treated like family
*   Value quality, optionality, and convenience
*   Often far from family + unwilling to relocate

*   Unofficial bilingual translator
*   Filial piety + "sandwich generation"
*   Struggle to navigate care options for seniors

**= Burnout**
"What is easy for a clinician is not 'easy' for me ... I shouldn't be in charge of this" ²

## Slide 6: Historical Challenges

**HISTORICAL CHALLENGES**

The cost of launching a PACE has historically been a steep barrier, especially when most operators are non-profits

**Typical PACE Center Timeline**
*Timeline with milestones and approximate time/census:*
*   **Year 0**: Center Contribution $ (negative, indicating initial investment)
*   **Center Opens**: 0 census
*   **Breaks Even**: 120 census
*   **Reaches Capacity**: 300 census

| Phase                       | Time             | Investment   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| :-------------------------- | :--------------- | :----------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Challenging Regulatory Process** | 18-24 months     | <$1M         | *   Competitive and restrictive approvals and expansion process<br>*   Laborious application requirements, including fiscal soundness, letters of support<br>*   Exacting state and federal gate checks and ongoing compliance                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Intensive Facility Development** | 12-24 months     | $4-15M        | *   10-20K sq ft space, must be secured before application<br>*   Balancing location, budget & timelines can create challenges for site selection<br>*   Onerous regulatory, clinical, safety, accessibility design requirements<br>*   Local and state permitting and inspections can cause delays                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Operating Losses w/ Sub-scale Operations** | 21-27 months     | $4-5M         | *   Must hire & train staff months before opening and with census growth<br>*   Administration, vendor, operations support costs are high when sub-scale<br>*   Risk adjustments to capitation rates is delayed by up to 15 months<br>*   Census growth relies on grass roots efforts to generate referrals                                                                                                                                   |

**~$10M + 7 yrs = is the price of admission**

## Slide 7: End State - Box Model

**END STATE - BOX MODEL**

We ultimately want to compress the timeline to capacity to **3 years**, so that we can replicate and expand predictably

**Typical PACE Center Timeline**
*Timeline with milestones and approximate time/census:*
*   **Year 0**: Center Contribution $ (negative, indicating initial investment)
*   **Center Opens**: 0 census
*   **Breaks Even**: 120 census
*   **Reaches Capacity**: 300 census

**Seen Health End-State PACE Center Timeline**
*Timeline with milestones and approximate time/census:*
*   **Startup (Approvals + Real Estate Development)**: 1 year
*   **Center Breakeven**: 0.5 year
*   **Scale + Reach Capacity**: 1.5 years
*   **Center Opens**: 20-40 census
*   **$ Breaks Even**: 100 census
*   **✓ Reaches Capacity**: 300 census
*   **⊕ Expanded Margins**: 25+%

**End-state Time to Capacity**
**3 Years**

## Slide 8: GTM Strategy

**GTM STRATEGY**

We believe a culturally-focused, tech-enabled, partnership-led model is the winning strategy to reach scale

**Seen Health**

**1. PACE Program**
**Culturally Focused Care Experience**
Aligning all aspects of PACE operations to provide **differentiated experiences** for target ethnic groups
*   **Culturally Focused**
    *   Care Teams
    *   Care Plans
    *   Support & Services
    *   Space & Design

**2. Tech Platform**
**Tech-enabled Care Delivery**
Empowering PACE staff with **integrated tech stack** for multi-disciplinary, multi-setting care delivery
*   **APPLICATIONS**
*   **WORKFLOWS**
*   **WORKFLOW ENGINE**
*   **DATA**
*   **INTEGRATIONS**
*   **INFRASTRUCTURE**
*   **THIRD PARTY SYSTEMS**

**3. Accelerators**
**Partnership-driven Go-to-Market**
Structurally accelerating paths to market, center breakeven, and tech development via partnerships
*   **Improved Economics by scaling quality** (Chart showing an S-curve for growth, indicating initial investment, break-even, then rapid growth and scaling)
*   **Playbooked Launch to compress timeline & cost**
*   **Faster Breakeven & Census Growth**

## Slide 9: PACE Program

**PACE PROGRAM**

We are going beyond language competence to provide an integrated, culturally focused experience to participants

**1. Culturally Aligned Care Teams**
*   Interdisciplinary team and support staff who can communicate directly in participant's **native tongue**
*   Intimate understanding of participant's **preferences, heritage, and beliefs**
*   Contracted providers who are either **culturally aligned** or have **extensive experience with our demographic**
*   Collaborate with and compensate **family caregivers** as part of IDT team

**Differentiated Experience for Singular Cultures**
*(Central image of a senior surrounded by icons representing different aspects of care)*

**2. Culturally Adept Care Plans**
*   Partner with **community physicians** to refer & co-manage eligibles in their panel without switching providers
*   Incorporate **eastern medicine and wellness practices** (e.g. acupuncture) as part of care plans as appropriate
*   Involve and communicate with **family** on care plans and participant health status to foster connection
*   Develop expertise and capabilities in educating participants and families and delivering **palliative care**

## Slide 10: PACE Program

**PACE PROGRAM**

All aspects of our PACE program are designed to give participants a sense of belonging, familiarity, and comfort

**3. Culturally Fitting Space & Design**
*   Incorporate important **cultural elements and local community aesthetic** into center design
*   Incorporate participants **movement habits and socialization preferences** to inform floor plans
*(Images of various culturally appropriate living spaces)*

**Extension of the Home and Community**
*(Central image of a senior surrounded by icons representing different aspects of care and community integration)*

**4. Culturally Adapted Services & Activities**
*   Provide assistance to participants to **regularly engage and communicate with family and relatives**
*   Incorporate **cultural recreational activities** (e.g. Mahjong, karaoke, taichi) as part of core activity offerings
*   Extensive menu of aligned **nutrition and meal plans** to fit participant preferences and care plans
*   Embrace and celebrate important **cultural holidays** and traditions with participants and their families

## Slide 11: Tech Platform

**TECH PLATFORM**

We are creating an extensible data and workflow platform to supercharge care delivery and operations

**Embedded Development**
*(Diagram showing Ops, Participants, Tech, Providers in a circular flow)*
Embed tech teams with providers and operators to build trust & empathy, accelerate iteration speed, and develop a data-driven deployment approach

**Integrated Tech Stack**

By deeply integrating off-the-shelf systems and services, we can supercharge care delivery and operations without reinventing the entire stack

**Extensible Architecture**
*(Layered diagram showing APPLICATIONS at the top, down to THIRD PARTY SYSTEMS at the bottom)*
A modern architecture enables us to adapt to the ever evolving complexity of PACE and operationalize data and insights at the site and time of care

## Slide 14: Progress To Date

**PROGRESS TO DATE**

Our inaugural center in LA will focus on Chinese & Taiwanese seniors in San Gabriel Valley (SGV)

**1 We chose SGV for its ethnic diversity**
SGV has to one of the largest Asian and Pacific Islanders (API) populations in the U.S. (500K+), with a high concentration of Chinese and Taiwanese families—perfect for proving our cultural-focused care model.¹
**CONCENTRATION OF API ELDERLY POPULATION²** *(Heatmap on a map of the San Gabriel Valley area showing higher concentration in central areas)*

**2 We estimate 7400+ PACE eligibles in our service area**
In our 70 zip codes, there is enough qualified elderly to fill 25 PACE centers³

**3 We received state approval in Dec 2022**
We were the only de novo application approved for LA in 2022, and 1/4 in CA⁴

**4 Our 500 participant center will open July 2024**
We secured a 20,565 SF space in Alhambra to serve up to 500 participants in our service area *(Image of a building exterior rendering)*

## Slide 25: Market Context

**MARKET CONTEXT**

Many seniors want to age-in-place but few have the options or resources to do so

*(Continuum of care with Home, Hired Caregiver, Adult Day Health Centers, PACE, Assisted Living / RCFEs, Intermediate Care Facilities, Institution, Nursing Home)*

| Category         | Pros/Cons                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| :--------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Family Caretaker** | *   Sacrifice on career/desires<br>*   Many may be forced to pick between career and caretaking<br>*   Support & services options are challenging to navigate<br>*   Potential social isolation for seniors<br>*   May lead to friction and guilt for both the cared for and caregiver |
| **PACE**         | *   We've search across healthcare and found **PACE** to be the best comprehensive care model for frail seniors.<br>*   We believe that PACE can empower seniors to **age-in-place with dignity** and provide their **families peace of mind** |
| **Nursing Home** | *   Expensive and out of reach for most<br>*   $108,000 on avg. for private room<br>*   Requires seniors to relocate from their homes, and often become disconnected from their families<br>*   Quality varies significantly<br>*   For immigrant families, sending loved ones to nursing homes equates to "abandoning family" |

## Slide 26: The Opportunity

**THE OPPORTUNITY**

PACE has full freedom under global capitation to coordinate, deliver & pay for what participants need to age safely at home

"Every geriatrician loves this model... there might be less money, but you spend it the way you want to, without getting on the phone for insurance company approval"
– Mark Lachs, co-chief of geriatrics and palliative medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine

"If a person's air-conditioner breaks during a heat wave, we replace it. If there's a snowstorm and they need food, we send it."

continuous data and workflow management.
*   The system includes a central "Workflow Engine" and "Data" layer to enable extensibility.
*   **Third Party Systems**: These are segmented by function: Clinical, Ops, Admin, Other.
    *   **Clinical**: EHR, Home Care, Pharmacy / PBM, Telehealth / RPM
    *   **Ops**: Transportation, Scheduling, Facilities, Inventory
    *   **Admin**: TPA, Finance, HR, IT, State & Federal Reporting
    *   **Other**: External Providers, Vendor Systems, HIES / HISPs, External Data Feeds

## Slide 32: Tech Platform: Buy

**TECH PLATFORM: BUY**

We will build upon and integrate best-in-class third party systems and services

*(Layered diagram of Seen Health's tech stack similar to previous pages, emphasizing the "buy" strategy by showing third-party systems at the base)*

**Third Party Systems**
We will select and leverage third party systems and services as building blocks for our PACE stack, so we can focus our resources on core IP

**Embedding Data and UI**
We will integrate data and functionality from each system into our stack and make them available and useful for corresponding staff

Similar to the concept of Reverse ETL¹, we want to make insights and workflows available within the external systems that providers and staff already use

## Slide 33: Tech Platform: Build

**TECH PLATFORM: BUILD**

Workflows, data engineering, and integrations are core competencies

*(Layered diagram of Seen Health's tech stack, similar to previous pages, emphasizing "build" components)*

**Workflow Engine**
Model, execute, and measure care and operations workflows that span systems, roles, and settings. Enable staff to maintain and evolve workflows using no-code tools.
*   Automation
*   Approval & Overrides
*   Role Based Access Control
*   Form Builder
*   Process Builder
*   Workflow Model & Mapping

**Modern Data Infrastructure**
Use enterprise grade tools to wrangle data from all internal and external sources. Make insights available and actionable at the time and site of care.
*   Transformation
*   Analytics
*   Visualization
*   History
*   Alerts
*   Compliance

**Integrations**
Create to establish direct, reliable, near real-time data sync between our central databases and vendor systems
*   Near real-time Bi-directional Sync
*   Flatfiles

## Slide 34: Workflows: Enable

**WORKFLOWS: ENABLE**

We are mapping all PACE workflows in detail as the foundation for care model, operations, tech development

*(Example Workflow: PRIMARY CARE ASSESSMENT)*

| Location                | Home                                  | Center, Home, Community                                   | Center                                 |
| :---------------------- | :------------------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------- |
| **Participant actions** | Takes initial intake form             | Confirm scheduling of assessment                          | Signs off on care plan                 |
| **Frontstage actions**  | Primary care department contacts participant to conduct initial enrollment/intake form | Primary care department contacts participant to schedule assessment | Completes assessment + reviews with practitioner |
|                         |                                       | Practitioner (IDT member) to conduct standard primary care assessment | Social worker brings care plan to participant - explains care plan |
|                         |                                       | Additional assessments done as needed (PT, OT, etc.)      |                                        |
| **Backstage actions**   | Primary Care department creates entry for participant for entry form | Primary care department assigns PCP to participant | Primary care department consults/enters info into master schedule for timing |
|                         |                                       | Providers create care plan                                | IDT members approve/sign off on care plan |
|                         |                                       |                                                           | IDT team members issue service orders based on care plan |

*(Start Here bubble in the workflow map shows "Enrollment", then "Care Plans" and "Reporting", connected to various modules like "Compliance", "Risk Adjustment", "Claims", "Scheduling", "Transportation", "SDRs")*
