Prime Minister Narendra Modi has urged the artificial intelligence startups to focus more on healthcare innovation, highlighting the potential of AI to support affordable, inclusive, and preventive health services in the country.

In a recent discussion ahead of the Indian AI Impact Summit 2026, PM Modi had engaged with leaders of 12 India-based AI startups that were selected under the India AI Impact Summit’s Foundation Model category.

The 12 AI startups included healthtech startups such as Intellihealth (NeuroDx).

The Prime Minister emphasized that AI solutions should be ethical, unbiased, and grounded in strong data privacy protections, particularly in areas involving patient data and hospital information systems.

Further, he also reiterated the need for India’s AI ecosystem to deliver solutions that are “Made in India, Made for the World”, capable of operating effectively in Indian languages and low-resource settings.

Additionally, he reiterated the role of AI entrepreneurs as “co-architects of India’s future” and highlighted that the upcoming summit will be an important platform to showcase innovations that could enhance primary care access, support clinicians, and expand health services in tier-2 and tier-3 cities.

The India AI Impact Summit 2026 is scheduled for next month in New Delhi and is expected to feature innovative solutions from AI startups across sectors, including healthcare, advanced analytics, and more.

Last year, in November, Digital Health News organised the DHN Innovation Challenge at IIT Indore, as a pre-event to the India AI Impact Summit 2026, bringing together healthcare-focused innovations.

The initiative saw participation from a wide range of healthtech startups from across the country.
