**Client**
Hi. Thanks for taking the time to talk with me. I am interested in learning more about healthcare automation and medical scribing and understanding some of the startups in this space like Abridge, Nabla, Suki. If you could start with a little bit about your background that'd be great.

**Expert**
I, myself, am a physician, so I come at this understanding how the end-users are ultimately going to engage and the root cause of the problems that exist after 15 years of being a provider. For the past seven years, taken that skill set and oversee clinical IT for a large for-profit healthcare system. We do business in 30 or 50 states, annual NPR of $11 billion. We've got 65 acute care hospitals. We've got hundreds of medical office buildings that surround all of our hospitals. We also have a large presence in the post-acute space. Think long-term care, behavioral health, and rehab. Yet, all that has come about due to a lot of M&A.

We've picked up a lot of complex healthcare systems or small players and try to fit them into our overall vision. With that, we support eight EHRs on the inpatient side, we support three EHRs on the outpatient, and then four EHRs in the post-acute space. I'm left with the challenge, I oversee all of our EHRs, all of our clinical AI and innovation, "Okay, make it work. Make all the different solutions that we have that aren't going away," which the EHRs most of the time aren't going away.

Yet everybody wants AI. Everybody wants ease of use with documentation. This journey that I've been on for the past two and a half years with AI scribing has been one of I can't find one vendor that does everything, so I need to find a vendor that help in different segments.

Therefore, I've probably trialed just about every vendor you've listed and probably five or six more and know about all 20 vendors that are out there because I'm constantly looking about who's got the latest and greatest, who can help me across multiple care settings. I think, to me, that's where we'll dig into some of the complexity of these vendors of who's doing well versus who's landlocked and what their service offerings are.

**Client**
That is incredibly helpful. We've probably spent quite a few weeks digging into this space, so feel free to get into the weeds. We're definitely, I think, at least speaking most of the same language. Most of us on our team come from a software background. Having that level of implementation challenge sounds horrifying. Godspeed.

**Expert**
Yeah. I work with a lot of the VCs on this kind of vision as well. I know a lot of them, we talk well about where they are with some of these series investment, My role is unique in not only am I looking at these deciding, because I'm one of one and we don't really have a robust internal team, we tend to really be an outsourced healthcare system. I'm overseeing the launches.

You made a great point at the very beginning. The difficult part, how do you get to phase II and phase III with these products? That, to me, is the secret that still exists of, how do you progress, even if at the surface it sounds really enticing? That's a problem that still is going to continue.

I think, ultimately, the burden is going to be on the vendors to try to solve for that. If we open up the doors, the vendors need to own a little bit more of that if there's really going to be success in numbers that we go and get. That's the overarching approach here. We can dig into every vendor. I'm customers of many of them and/or have kicked the tires on everyone and found out why they're not a good fit.

**Client**
That's a great place to start. Why don't we just go through the list of who you're using and then how many physicians they're on, if they're inpatient, outpatient, and if they cover any specialties.

**Expert**
Absolutely. Start with Abridge. I know their leadership really well. I think incredibly high of their leadership. The issue, to me, has been it is a great story, it is a great premise, but it really has to fit a certain level of what the healthcare system has. There is a very good relationship, probably, I'll say, a great relationship they have with Epic, but not a lot of other EHRs.

In very complicated for-profit healthcare systems, there's always a variety of EHRs. It's just the nature of for-profit healthcare. Academic, not-for-profit, you'll probably find a harmonized EHR system. A) If you're Epic, that makes Abridge a very compelling use case. The piece is it's really just an outpatient product right now. About a year ago, we started using them in an outpatient primary care capacity. We have scaled to add certain specialties now, neurology, orthopedics, cardiology.

We've added to the mix of what we can offer, but the limitations are it's only Epic-integrated and it's really not ready yet, though we are considering using it in the emergency rooms as a next phase of where the vendor is going. To me, all of those numbers I talked at the beginning, we are an acute-driven business. That's just where all the revenue reimbursement comes from.

The outpatient world feeds what we do on the acute side, labs, diagnostics, surgery, all of that is going to funnel in to the acute side and that's where the numbers really show. I'm always looking for products that can help me with those providers because, to me, that's what's going to unlock unlimited potential for AI in this space. Abridge really isn't there yet. I would say probably by end of 2025, there's probably going to be a stronger play with our hospitalists and scaling up complexity from there, but we're still not there yet. It's continuing to grow, but you better be Epic or you're probably not going to use Abridge.

**Client**
Got it. Even on the acute care side, you have some hospitals that are using Epic?

**Expert**
Yes. The sites that are using Abridge right now are both Epic inpatient, Epic outpatient, Epic emergency rooms. We have probably of our, let's say a fictional 100%, about 15%-20% are Epic-based sites. Those outpatient Epic markets are using it today. We probably have provider counts probably somewhere close to 100. It's only been a year. We have been very methodical about rolling this out because as we talk about, the root issue here is, how do you get to phase II and phase III?

We're in that murkiness right now because we don't have local informatica teams that are really going to be able to drive this. We don't have it at a corporate level. The vendor, though willing and able, how do you facilitate some of that onboarding and that continued churn of, "Hey, what can we do to improve it"? It happens, but it's not necessarily a smooth, seamless process.

To me, that is one of those self-limiting steps of these products is, "Great that we've got 100 providers. How do I get another 100?" Because it does need to continue to not forget about the 100 that you have. In theory, a hospital system needs to build out an AI team, an innovation team that can do a lot of the work and stimulate growth.

A lot of healthcare systems haven't really A) found the ROI to justify that yet. B) When it gets to the acute side and we know there's ROI reimbursement-wise for us to do with more efficiency, we'll consider it then. To me, that's why we're stuck in this middle ground right now with where Abridge is.

**Client**
Got it. You have 100 providers on the solution now. What is the potential value within that existing base that is outpatient on Epic?

**Expert**
I would tell you probably that number is closer to 300 total that would fit that outpatient Epic, all specialties in that outpatient care setting. Three hundred would be the 100%. We're probably 1/3 of the way. To me, the secret is, how do you get those remaining 2/3s? These products are going to pick up 40% no matter what because it's so compelling to a lot of providers today.

Your younger provider, your residents, they love this. They're all over this. It's that remaining 60% that, to me, are the hardest to get because either they're suspect, either they're looking for the product to do more, i.e., code, loading up orders for you. If I say it, it should be ordered. There's just a lot of, "Well, come back to me when it already does more and I'll be interested."

You have your providers at the end of their career say, "Listen, I got three to four years left. I'm not getting on the AI train." You just have to leave them alone. That's why that number, you'll never get 300 out of 300. Your best should be somewhere about getting 75%, 80% should be your absolute goal.

**Client**
That makes sense. On the acute care side, what's the denominator there?

**Expert**
Sure. We're probably looking at closer to 800 providers in those Epic markets that we could look at candidates. I'm including emergency rooms, I'm including the hospital side. That's where there's a lot more providers to go and get. Even those that are affiliated with our hospital who maybe just aren't full-time employees, why wouldn't we offer it to them to do all their work? Because it's still billing on our behalf in those hospitals. That's why that number is a lot larger on the inpatient side.

**Client**
That makes sense. In total, you have about 1,100 potential providers that could be on Abridge given they're in the Epic ecosystem with you?

**Expert**
Correct.

**Client**
That makes sense. In terms of even rolling out to the 100, so you're past the pilot phase now. Is that right?

**Expert**
Correct. We did some heavy lifting on the ground, organic engagement, going to sites. Leadership at Abridge joined me. We did a lot of outreach in the markets to build that up, and it worked. Again, have we done something for phase II and phase III? I can't say that definitively we have.

**Client**
Just taking a step back, how many people were in the pilot?

**Expert**
We had, I'll just say 20. We are thinking closer to 25. We had 20 in the pilot.

**Client**
When did you convert to a full-time license?

**Expert**
Middle of the year. Probably within the past four to five months, we flipped many of those early into a longer, wider net.

**Client**
To get you to that 100 now?

**Expert**
Correct. Just to be clear on that number, we, at the the hospital market areas, have quite a few residents. We've added residents to that. I don't want to give you, "Hey, this is 100." There are some residents in there, which, again, to me is a positive. It's a good thing. Again, I might conflate the numbers a little bit because those residents aren't guaranteed to stay at our hospitals once they leave. Just keep that in mind.

**Client**
That makes sense. I'm trying to figure out when you contract with any of these scribes or any of these solutions, my understanding is a lot of people are paying a per seat license. We are going to roll this out to 100 people. Is that guaranteed for the year? How does expansion work? I'm trying to tie together the concept of wanting to put more people on it and also this enterprise contract perspective.

**Expert**
Sure. I love the question. I think you see a lot of us out there going, "Hey, we just picked up 10,000 providers at Kaiser," something like that statement. What does that mean? You've shown an interest and a willingness to say, "I'm going to try to get all my providers on this." You're not hearing is that that isn't a commit to get everybody on it. That's a, "I'm only going to pay for it when a provider onboards and I'm not tied to that contract if I don't use it." That's really what you do.

You're trying to get a certain price point. If I say I'm willing to get you up to 10,000 providers and it's set to scale. If I'm going to pay a price for the first 500, I'm probably going to pay 10% less at provider 501. I'm not committed to any length of time right now because there is so much vendor competition. There's only one vendor that you committ to, and I'll get to them in a second.

You're really not landlocked into this. You might sign a yearly, "Hey, I'm going to commit to this provider for a year. If that provider leaves my organization, I'm going to take that license back, either reallocate it, or I'm not going to pay for it because it no longer is used by that provider." The organizations have a lot more latitude of that fictitious, "Hey, we bought 10,000 subscriptions."

**Client**
That's pretty scary.

**Expert**
That's what's out there when they make big announcements. As I mentioned to you, 40% of that 10,000 are probably going to be good, interested people who are going to pick up very early on. It's that 6,000 remaining that are very on the edge or potentially never gettable.

**Client**
That makes sense. I want to go in so many directions. I guess just quickly closing the loop on the Abridge piece. Right now, you're at the 100. Are you thinking about expanding to the remaining 200? Where are you guys at with that?

**Expert**
We have thought who has been easy to obtain on the outpatient side we feel like we've got. It's going to take some heavy manual lift going into markets, going to each practice, building up some more belief, which, again, requires the a service side of this process. What we've thought is, eventually, they're either going to come to the table or they're not. They're going to hear about their colleague who's using things. We're more compelled to move forward with the acute version.

We're talking right now about rolling this through in our emergency rooms and saying, "Let's just start thinking about the acute side, and then eventually either do a big relaunch in the outpatient," or just say "Hey, eventually, we're going to cross paths with some of those providers because many times, they work on the acute side. When the product can help on both, we will catch them then when we're actually focused on the acute side." We've shifted into, "Let's get to that semi acute space, ie., the emergency room, and see what happens over the next couple of months."

**Client**
Okay. You are actively working with Abridge on thinking about what expansion can look like?

**Expert**
Literally I had a phone call last night about something with them, so yes.

**Client**
What are some key milestones that you need to see or what are some of the goals you really want to see from them on the emergency side?

**Expert**
To me, I put the emergency as that bridge. I didn't mean to play on words here, but to me, it's the bridge of we feel good about outpatient. We, as a healthcare system, really focus on the acute side because that's where the reimbursement is. If we're not ready for that prime time today, what gives us that time for it to get more mature? You now what? It's the emergency room. That's where we can find a ton of value.

We're taking it at a pace that they are going at, which it aligns with how we're scaling. What am I looking for? I'm looking for a product that's ready to go and work with a provider who's doing rounds on the inpatient side. That's going to work in a complex care setting like an ED, which might not have a nice, concise four walls and a private door, and is going to say, "Hey, this is still going to work for a provider who is in and out of these rooms and is going to work for them and be really seamless."

That is really the key step of how we up the ante of the expectation of product. We know it's accurate, we know it aligns with a lot of the workflows. Emergency docs have different workflows than a primary care and a neurologist. The workflows are very different. How can we make sure that they get the specificity that they're looking for?

To me, those are some of the challenges that we're putting on the vendor to say, "It's great that you can read back everything that's said and align it. Are you going to put out kind of thinking in there that's going to align with an emergency room doc who reads EKGs, who reads diagnostic reports, says something in a quick blurb? Is that going to end up in a note?" Those are the types of things that we're pushing the vendor to lean into, to say, "Hey, if we're going to go here, are we ready to align with emergency room docs?" That is the challenge.

**Client**
There's definitely a product. It feels like a fundamental technology of ambient listening and doing the note generation is fine, but there's a product lift that needs to happen in terms of getting that aligned with a very specific ICP.

**Expert**
There's a specialty component that has to take the product beyond just saying, "We're good at listening and being able to format notes."

**Client**
That makes sense. You've got 100 now, looking to emergency. Do you have a sense of that timeline of how many people that might be? Is that going to be a pilot? When?

**Expert**
Sure. That's probably early Q1 into Q2 of next year. It probably includes somewhat like 60-70 providers. Again, what are we doing? We're really trying to buy ourselves time so that by mid year 2025, we're ready to go and shift to the acute model, which has a lot more providers and will be a much larger campaign that we hope A) the vendor can help us from a customer support model, as well as, "Hey, we've been able to prove an ROI that allows us to say maybe we need to internalize and build up our staffing model to accommodate this."

Though it takes care of itself, there is still some coaxing along monthly, "Hey, what can we do to improve it?" There's just constant optimization opportunities that if you don't poke your head up, because you don't have the staff, you just let it sit there, which is what's happening right now.

**Client**
That makes sense. Just quickly, what are the churn risks for you on Abridge?

**Expert**
I think it's mild. 100% being 100% churn, I'm going to say somewhere in the 15%-20% range, only because providers are looking to challenge the product to do more. They want a product that can take them into multiple care settings. A provider who goes to a nursing home or goes to a behavioral health facility. They want a product that can track with them. That, to me, is a good thing because they really want to use AI to its fullest potential.

This is the challenge that, otherwise, there's another vendor who is a little bit more, let's say, progressive in a product that can take a provider wherever they go in a variety of care settings. That is why I'm probably a little bit more bullish on that vendor only because that, to me, is what providers are looking for. It's great that it can help me here, but care is diverse. Care takes me a lot of places. Can this product track me wherever I go? That, to me, is I think still a little bit of a challenge of why there's some churn, but not a lot.

**Client**
Makes sense. A little churn risk is healthy. It pushes product forward. That's good to know. Really quickly, last question on Abridge, the usage on 100 physicians, do you have a sense of what the monthly active is?

**Expert**
Sure. From their all total of about 100, let's say they're about 66%, that's about 2/3s of the time they are using the product on all of their encounters and visits, which is a very encouraging sign. We'd love that to be somewhere at around 70% because to me, that really shows there's never going to be 100% where they're always going to have a scenario to use this, but we should expect somewhere about 70%.

There could be a patient who says, "I don't want to be recorded." "Hey, this patient was in and out and I couldn't set the time." There's all that. I think we're pretty good with the frequency of use and the KPIs with time saved, no times after 5:00 P.M. All of those are trending in the right direction.

**Client**
Got it. How does Abridge's monthly active users benchmark against some of the other solutions you're using?

**Expert**
It is relatively in the same ballpark. I'll put Nabla in the same category as Abridge. That, to me, is a vendor that I think I see a little bit more of flexibility with. I will say one of the eye-opening ones has been these two vendors trend above where Nuance DAX is. I was the biggest fan of DAX two years ago.

I have really changed my tune on it because I just have not seen a lot of progression and I think the feedback from our end user has been closer to somewhere like 55%-60% of the time, which at the price that we're paying is really not a good thing. It is above others in this space. We did pilots with Suki in the past where we only had probably 30%-40% utilization, which, again, is an ominous sign. I think we're at good trends with the two that we most prefer now.

**Client**
Makes sense. Do you still have users on DAX?

**Expert**
We do, yes. We have about 50 users on DAX.

**Client**
Is that in an Epic ecosystem or outside?

**Expert**
That is outside of it. That is in both Oracle Cerner and in athena Marketplace.

**Client**
Got it. Maybe we can just spend a bit of time on the vendor that you've been really loving.

**Expert**
I think Nabla would be that vendor. To me, they're a very strong alternative to Abridge. While they don't get all of the notoriety because they're not attached at the hip with Epic, what they are doing is, "Hey, great. 40% of the market is Epic, but you know what else is out there, 60% that aren't Epic." What are they doing? They're working to get on all of those other EHRs. Yes, it's complex. Yes, it's a struggle because some of the EHRs aren't as adept as Epic. That's a clear statement.

What are they doing? They're getting on Allscripts, they're getting on Oracle Cerner. They have full integration into Epic even if they may be Epic's third choice over DAX and Nuance, they're still a very compelling use-case. Epic will say Nabla is a perfectly viable vendor that will encourage you to use. They're helping me across multiple care settings.

I use Nabla in an emergency room setting now. Again, what all this means is they are the most progressive in using it across multiple care settings, which means a ton to me because of all the diversity of care that we provide across our healthcare system.

I need a vendor that a provider who's seeing patients in this practice today goes and sees a patient in an emergency room six hours later and is going to round on that patient three days from now. I want a vendor that can help that provider across all those care settings. Now, the EHRs may be different, and oftentimes they are, but can I still use this product with relative ease and still have that integration? That, to me, is what separates Nabla from Abridge.

**Client**
That makes a lot of sense. I'm curious, what's the journey with Nabla been like? When did you pilot? When did you convert to an enterprise contract? How many on pilots, how many on the full contract now?

**Expert**
This is literally under a year that this has all progressed. I've always been challenging them. I looked at Ambiance, we trialled Suki, we understand DeepScribe. I looked at all of them going, "Okay, at some point, I need a vendor that can help me across these tiers. Who is most willing? Who's got the willingness to integrate? Who's got the customer support model that's going to help me because I don't have a ton behind me to do it myself?"

It's been about a year now. We have scaled accordingly. We started with emergency rooms. We are now moving forward with all these additional post-acute spaces. What have we done? We've really allowed the product to A) mature, B) set up some of the integration for us, which they have gone and done on their own time, which we can benefit from and say, "Hey, we do not have to wait for that integration. You're coming with that now so I can roll into markets and be a lot better where I don't have to push copy paste forever."

I can say, "There is integration," and jump on board. When I say to you, "I've got challenges in our inpatient psychiatric hospitals," I don't hear a vendor telling me, "Well, just give us another year." I've got a vendor say, "Listen, we'll work with you. We'll personalize those workflows. If you've got willing physician champions in these markets, let's go," because we're very bullish on what the product can do.

I think, to me, that's why they have been a great pairing for me because I am presented with all these challenges and yet they're always willing to help me. Whatever the EHR is, whatever the care setting, their immersion into each of those is really compelling. Abridge says, "Hey, if they're Epic, we'll think about it." That's not a knock. That's just their business approach, which differs greatly from Nabla.

**Client**
You haven't seen a willingness from Abridge to want to look at any of the other EHRs?

**Expert**
That's what's happening lately. There is one other EHR that they're working to get onto, and it's a good one. They're working to get onto Athena. That's their second EHR and their last EHR that they're willing to partner. They don't have an exclusive with Epic, but it's close. That's a good thing for them. It's an awesome business approach that they take it, but that doesn't help for those who have Epic and everything else.

I'm always going to have to say, "Yeah, I might love Abridge in my Epic markets, but I'm always going to need another vendor for everything else." At some point, if I can say, Nabla as an example, they can help me with the everything else. They also do work in Epic, even if they're not Epic's number one. There's a lot of compelling use to say, "Why do we need Abridge then?" That's the kind of scenario that exists where you could potentially knock Abridge slightly because they're not on other EHRs.

**Client**
That makes a lot of sense. How many people are on Nabla today?

**Expert**
Today, we have lower numbers. We are close to 40. The reason it's lower is because we've started in very complex settings, emergency rooms, behavioral health. We've gone to everything but the ambulatory right now to try to build out the complexity of the product. Now, we're also retrofitting and putting it into our ambulatory market. It was a different strategy of how to use them.

Originally, I was focused on using DAX and Abridge in my outpatient, and I was looking for everything else to be covered by Nabla. Because DAX has faded from integration-friendly, it's still the highest cost. Abridge has this Epic vision only. I need somebody else who can think broader. That, to me, is why Nabla is a good fit for us because of all that diversity that I bring to the table and, of course, diversity of EHRs, too.

**Client**
That makes sense. What was the pace of scale to that 40? Was it like 10 and then five and then 10? Did you just add on month-over-month?

**Expert**
Sure. It was buckets of 10 at a time, really. Waves of 10. I know I've got five docs here in this EHR that started this emergency room. I'll tack this on to other five in the area. It was very strategic because I needed, "Hey, if I'm going to use this in an emergency room, I need advocates that are going to support this if I go to site two, three, four." We were very strategic. A lot of hands on to get those markets off the ground. Why? Because no other vendors had been in those spaces before and still there are very few that have broached some of these areas.

The number is good. The number has a lot more to get now that we've solved a lot of that on-the-ground complexity, which makes the additional sites so much easier. We're virtualizing all the onboarding now at most of our sites. We're not having to go to make it work. We're leaning into what we've succeded at other sites and onboarding everybody virtually. The product can be scoped virtually. That, to me, is where you're starting to see a lot more success of you don't need manpower on the ground if you can virtually get everybody supported with what you created initially, which is a very good sign.

**Client**
That makes sense. I have two big questions. One is, it sounds like there's less than 200 people using any ambient scribe. What is everyone else doing from a documentation perspective?

**Expert**
Correct. We are using products like M*Modal or Dragon right now for dictation. That's it. There is no alternative. Our business, on our number at the end of the year, 70% comes from our acute side of the house. Though the outpatient markets are important, we've really tried to look at this going, "When these vendors are ready for the acute, we can go really big."

In a case-by-case basis in the outpatient realm, sure, we can do it, but it's a handholding process. Do you really want to handhold there when you know you don't need to handhold a lot on the acute side? It's just a business distinction, I think, for us. Our local markets don't have IT support in these clinics. Who's going to help support some of these providers? What do we have? We have IT support on the acute side that sit in our hospitals who will probably be more able to help these.

Again, you can't outpace what the products can do. Everybody is not ready for the acute models yet, unless you precisely allocate where these products go. I think my vision is get this to where acute feels good and you'll pick up a lot of those outpatient providers. Because we're just not outpatient only, it just doesn't give us that "Let's put all the effort in now," when the bigger ask is going to be on the acute side upcoming, hopefully in 2025.

**Client**
That makes sense. The other question I had was more of a broader market question. You guys obviously use quite a number of EHRs. There's like 500 big health systems in the U.S. Do you have a sense of what percentage of organizations are similar to you guys in that it's a hodgepodge of EHRs versus ones that are Epic only or Athena only, like these more concentrated ones?

**Expert**
I think, to me, and I'll put ourselves similar to like the UHS, an Ochsner, an Ascension, an HCA, which we are a sister of HCA going back 25 years. The way I sum this up best is those in the for-profit space, those who have a variety of care settings that aren't just the perfect harmony of outpatient and inpatient. We have a lot of that post-acute. I would say the more for-profit healthcare systems, you are going to find a lot of EHR complexity.

Even those that are on mostly Epic, if I was to ask them, what do you do for your derm docs? What do you do for your dentistry? What do you do for GI? They're probably going to say, "We use Mod Med," or "We use a specific specialty EHR." There is a ton of variety out there. The farther you get away from a not-for-profit or an academic center that has a ton of residents, you are going to find that there's an overwhelming a lot of complexity there.

To me, that's why you see a lot of the news today. You see, "Hey, they picked up University of X, they picked up Cleveland Clinic, they picked up all these." What do they all have in common? They're either not-for-profits or they're perfectly harmonized academic medical centers and surrounding healthcare systems. You're not seeing, "Ascension picked up this," because there's so much more complexity.

Sure, we're using these products, but are we giving them 10,000 providers? No, because we know our providers aren't on one system. Our providers at a time could be on three different EHRs and work in our market spaces. Again, the for-profits are the ones that really haven't tapped into this fully yet because they come with the most complexity.

They come with all these care settings because those IDN type of care means I want to help a patient that's five years old, but I also have that patient who's 80 in one of my long-term care facilities. How do I connect the two when I know the systems they use are completely different and never the same? There's a lot of business out there still to get because right up until now, it's been easy with, "We can get academics. We can get those university systems that really want to tap into this because they want the residents to have it early."

The residents leave those programs, go somewhere else and say, "Hey, I used this during residency. I love it." That's why you see so many of those willing to, probably behind the scenes, I'll first tell you, you're not paying for the residents. They want the residents to use it now because the residents organically take the product wherever they go once they graduate and become advocates long term.

**Client**
I get it. It really does feel like it's becoming like a product strategy distribution knife fight.

**Expert**
It is. The price point, we came from a year ago, we were paying for DAX $1,500 a month per provider. You add $18,000 a year onto a provider using that product, it better be a general surgeon, it better be an orthopedic practice, or it better be a provider seeing 40 patients a day to justify the extra $18,000 a year.

That price has come down to somewhere closer to $500 now. Still much better. I can tell you I have got products at a quarter of that price tag that are even better than DAX. How do you justify those costs?

That, to me, is where you have seen consolidation. You've seen the market come down with pricing. Now, somebody would say, "Well, it's just going to keep coming down." Probably not. Because what you're going to start to see is if I want to start adding on coding, "I want to add on some RCM or rev integrity," you're going to have tiered pricing, which is going to bring these prices back up incrementally. That's where I still think these vendors have room to gain a little bit more per month per provider because the basics is going to be somewhere like $100 a month. "You want AI, $100."

Anything else on top of that, this feature we turn on is going to be incremental price tags. That, to me, is how these vendors are still going to remain very profitable and they really haven't tapped into what's still out there. I say there is still 55%, 60% of the market that they can still go and get that haven't made one decision of, "Let us just go with this vendor only."

**Client**
This has been super helpful. I'm sure I'm missing some of the context since I wasn't on at the start of the call. It sounds like you were talking about there's only a 15%-20% range of maybe churning from an Abridge. As I hear how you talk about Nabla and the need for multi-provider, what leads to you not wanting to consolidate to one solution like a Nabla? Why keep both going forward?

**Expert**
I'm always thinking that, to me, is an outcome that you should really strongly consider. What I will hear from a straight technology side of the house will say, "Well, they're an early entry. Could they get swallowed up? Do we want to be saturated with just one vendor and be beholden to them maybe not keeping up the pace that we have?" I always think there could be a compelling, "Let's have two preferred." I think two is probably a good example because again, what are you doing?

A) You're going to continue to push both vendors, but B) you're probably never going to have them at an equal state of what they both can do. To me, if you can say Abridge is maybe always going to be best for outpatient because it has the patient side of it. It has that patient app where patients can record, patients can listen to the caregiver later in the day. That's a strong piece that other vendors don't have. I would say, "Well, okay, that's great for that market. That's a perfectly outpatient market and that provider will never touch another care setting."

The price is, though, more expensive than a Nabla, let's say. It's not that much more. Whereas a provider that's very diverse, that touches a lot of healthcare settings that we have, that has a variety of EHRs that they're going to need to use, they're probably a better candidate for this vendor because of that variability that they have. To me, that's how this should be thought of. I don't think it's a lot to ask to have two vendors support this in these markets, because to me, that tells me a hospital system is complex enough to support it. That is a good thing.

**Client**
That makes a lot of sense, both not wanting to be dependent on one vendor team, two, appreciating that each vendor is always going to have a strength the other lacks. Three, different providers have very different workflows. Abridge is going to make sense for outpatient only. Nabla is always going to make sense in the diverse workflow setting.

**Expert**
100% correct. I was going to say, HCA is a great example. They went big with Augmedix, which is now Commure. That makes sense. Why? Because they're mostly harmonized on MEDITECH. What did Augmedix do? They've walled away from other EHRs and are focused on MEDITECH. That works for that model, but that's going to stifle them to get to other healthcare systems that don't just have MEDITECH. They've got a lot of other things. Again, strategy here is really key. I would want to be as flexible as possible right now so I don't turn away business, even if it's the short prize to go and get today. I see a lot of that happening.

**Client**
That makes a lot of sense as well. The other piece I was going to touch on is, and you highlighted it. Abridge has this not quite exclusive, but very strong relationship with Epic. Epic will say, "Hey, sure, Nuance and Abridge are our partners, but you can also use a Nabla." As an end user or a customer, how do you tell the differences of that when you, say, use Nabla in an Epic setting? What is Abridge getting out of Epic that Nabla is not, even though Nabla is integrated?

**Expert**
Sure. I heard that with Epic three weeks ago in person and I used that exact statement you just made. All three apply and are viable. You're going to just get an extra additional layer of some of the natural integration when you get to that final stage of not just the showroom, but the final stage. However Epic is framing it today, it's like the final stage, and they've allowed both Abridge and DAX to get there.

Nabla isn't far behind. End users are never going to really notice that additional change behind the scenes, but it's just a little bit more streamlined workflow. Can I tap into patient scheduling, which taps into Abridge? There are some nuances that you'll be able to see, but it is subtle, and I don't think it should be the end all, be all that "Hey, we've got this great relationship." Awesome.

That doesn't remove other players from saying, "We're fully integrated with Epic." It's a very true statement. It's okay to not be number one or two. Three and four are certainly viable. Again, I wouldn't put so much weight into that. Even if you can say Epic promotes you best when they pick up these new businesses, but Epic doesn't churn away the other, to their credit. They don't shun others. You just might not be at that nth stage of integration that they've given Abridge and DAX.

**Client**
Got it. My follow-up would be, it sounds like you're taking a very thoughtful and strategic approach as you think about which of these providers to use and the pros and cons and the nuances of the integration. Would you say that peers at other health systems would take the same approach, or are they going to think about it more simplistically of, "Abridge and DAX are Epic partners. We're an Epic shop. Let's just use Abridge." I'm wondering if your peers at other health systems think of the same altitude or granularity you're thinking about.

**Expert**
I would say probably not because they don't have the service lines that we have. They've gone through this EHR consolidation five years ago or are going through it now. At the end of this, they're going to have Epic outpatient, emergency room and acute. They can say, "We can pick one of those three vendors." I will tell you who's losing a lot of business is DAX because it's high priced and it's struggling to keep up with the more diverse, smaller players.

Microsoft has not kept up with them. They're getting laughed right now. I think you can say we can pick one of them and be good, yes, because they're not thinking as complicated as I have to think. At some point, that works for them. I think, to me, what I'm having to also worry about is if I go heavy and try to say, "Hey, we don't have integration today, but let's go copy paste," or "Let's do all that."

That, to me, is why I've been more strategic than those that have already gone through those transformations and say, "Let's just pick Abridge, let's just pick Nabla," because we've done all of that. That's great for them, but they probably also don't have a healthcare system that's continuing to build out post-acute like we are.

We've gone from zero to 100 the past two years in those markets. Why? That's the hot markets right now. Building acute hospitals isn't, but post-acute is. That, to me, is where the business side of healthcare, which I am firmly entrenched in, takes me in a different direction than those that are just worried about the healthcare system and the perfectly boxed in kind of situations that they have.

**Client**
Got it. Really helpful. Another piece I wanted to touch on, I'm not sure if you two had chatted on this earlier, was understanding your interactions with the teams at Abridge and Nabla. I would love any perspective you have on different individuals you've worked with on Abridge's side and Nabla's side.

**Expert**
I know leadership at both extremely well. I have great connection to the top person at Abridge, know him very well and engage regularly on their progress and their success and the teams that sit in the customer support model. I think it's strong at Abridge. I was at a conference a week ago where Abridge was a representative and a director of one of the main conferences was telling me how well their customer support works and the feedback has been. I think that's to their credit.

What is the difference right now? It's a really controlled environment. It's working in an outpatient market. Honestly, at some point, it's a relatively self-contained area, so it's not as complex. I do have a little bit of I'd like to see what happens when we scale into more complex care settings. To me, the current model is going to need to continue to shift and transform.

At a Nabla level, is a little bit different. I know their leadership extremely well. What I have seen with their team that sits in that customer support is a deeper willingness to help me craft the vision. "Hey, we want to go into inpatient behavioral health. Are you a willing participant to help me create those workflows?" The answer is always a resounding yes.

"Hey, help me with inpatient rehab." That wouldn't be one of those areas that you think about for AI and yet it's absolutely a must have for me soon because we've got 50 rehab facilities that we do a lot of business with joint ventures and they're all asking me for these types of technologies. Whenever I put a new challenge forward, "Hey, let's expand this market space. Let's develop this and personalize it."

100% of the time, Nabla always says, "Let's do it, and here's the team that we can allocate to make that happen." Which, again, is a must-have for somebody like myself who sits more in a healthcare business expansion mode versus, "We've got Epic, we've really done this well, and we can sit back and watch it mature."

I would tell you, there's a lot of that healthcare business model that still exists that hasn't really tapped into the full AI experience yet, but is going to need to be because the easy pickups like the universities, like the not-for-profits which have been picked up the past 18 months, we're going to see, what else is going to be picked up in 2025? It's these larger healthcare systems where ROI and reimbursement are absolute paramount. How are these models going to work for them because there's much more challenge behind it?

**Client**
Okay. On that piece with Nabla you were talking about, they will say, "Yes, here's the team." Have you had enough time with them to say, "Yes, there's also follow-through. Not only are they committed to working with me on everything, but I'm seeing that actionable change pace of product development or customization." Have they done that extra mile, or it's, "Hey, they've committed to it," and now you need to see if they're actually doing that?

**Expert**
The change management, the governance, the scalability of a provider who starts and then 60 days later has additional feedback. We worked with a smaller emergency room in New Mexico going back six months now. These providers are spending three hours post their 24-hour shift to do notes, amazingly like, "Oh my gosh, that sounds crazy."

What we were able to do is even in a model that didn't have full integration because we don't have a great EHR in that market space, a cut and paste model that still was able to save the provider 60% of that three-hour timeline, what did we do? We formatted the workflows. We personalized how we interpret EKGs. We built in a lot of personalized experience that allows those providers to continue to improve this.

It's not just go, "Let's go heavy day one," and then never reappear. There is a 30, 60, 90 program to make sure these providers, as they become more aware of AI, they understand, "Look at this. I see an option for coding now. Let me test the waters here and see if this ICD-10 coding that it's offering me is actually accurate. Hey, let's build this out." That has been an absolute evidence that I've seen them continue to build out even what we create. Constantly optimizing is, again, another thing that works in their favor.

**Client**
Got it. If I jump back to Abridge, how would you describe the pace of their product development or new features and rollouts?

**Expert**
I think it's strong. Again, we've been methodical. We started primary care. There was a list of 10 specialties that were really good eight months ago. We've expanded that list. Now there's 35+ specialties. We've incrementally gone at the pace that they've continued to expand. That's why when I was saying to you three weeks ago, we had a conversation about expanding our emergency room use with Abridge because now they feel ready to go in those spaces. Again, we're just buying ourselves time, but we're going at their pace, which, to me, the pace has picked up, to their credit.

I would say a little bit of what may be happening here is they're looking to eventually scale into more the RCM side. Can we automate certain processes? Maybe coding, billing, maybe rev integrity. Some of that might be a little bit of, "Okay, that sounds compelling." Is that going to help your clinical end users? Probably not. Again, are you encroaching into areas where there's already certain automation that exists? Absolutely.

I may have a little bit of a question there about that being the next phase versus saying, "You know what? We're ready to go clinically on the acute side and work in the inpatient setting." To me, that might be a fork in a road that I choose that because there's a lot more clinical end users to get versus going RCM-heavy. Again, you could debate either of those next moves that are being made by Abridge.

**Client**
That makes a lot of sense. It sounds like they've almost committed to, "Hey, instead of trying to grab all of the different care settings and all the different EHRs, we might be happy with just these two and going deeper into the workflows, away from clinical end users into just health system RCM." Whereas another provider in the space might say, "Hey, no, we want to service all the various care settings and workflows just for the scribe piece before we go into, say, coding or RCM."

**Expert**
I 100% agree with you. Why? Because what am I going to do to pay for. The ROI is absolutely clear on the acute side. What am I going to get rid of? I'm going to get rid of Dragon, I'm going to get rid of M*Modal when I bring these AI products in place. I'm going to have an easier time knocking those off the perch because nobody likes them anyway. What am I going to struggle with? I'm going to struggle with knocking off the R1s, the MDaudits, the Healthicities because they're already automated and their claim to fame is RCM.

You could debate that next move. I'm sure there are reasons, pros and cons. My side of this is AI scribing, there's a lot of competition, but there is a lot of opportunity. You venture into RCM, you're entering into a lot of there's better vendors who have been doing it longer, who have better payer relationships today than an AI scribe vendor who's looking to knock into those spaces.

**Client**
On that piece, has it gotten to the point where Abridge has talked to you already on pitching you on why they think they should be displacing your RCM vendors or why they're better positioned to you, or have they still been mostly focused on the scribe and clinical user side?

**Expert**
Interesting question. I will tell you without getting into details. There was a conversation I had last night with a key person there already pitching what that potential RCM opportunity is. Now, that comes with, "Hey, they're working to get on to an additional EHR," so it doesn't come without a little bit of a hitch. You see what they're trying to pitch off. If we're going to get to the second EHR that they want to get onto, which is a straight 100% outpatient EHR-only, the next regression is going to be, "Well, now that we have that integration, we're a partner of theirs, how about tapping into some of the RCM processes?"

Absolutely, that has already been in play and I only see that continuing once they iron out that full integration with that EHR. It's a natural next step to continue to show, "All right, now that we've proven it here, are you ready for the financial pieces of this," which, I would tell you, it's going to have to undo like a 3M Solventum that does some of our billing coding. It's going to have to undo an MDaudit that does a lot of our rev integrity.

I will tell you, I can pitch it to any healthcare leadership today. I'm going to have a much, much harder time to go to our RCM internal team and say, "Hey, here's a vendor I want you to put faith in, that is a newer entry, that's only done the clinical side." That is a slippery, slippery slope. Because they're very suspect about what these vendors could potentially do when it comes to coding and billing.

Everybody's fearful of, is this just an upcoding play or is this legitimate? I don't think we're mature enough to say all the numbers prove this is what it's doing. I think we all believe it, but I don't have a lot of metrics to sway those that have been doing coding and billing for 15 or 20 years to say, "This vendor can replace who we currently use." It's a much steeper slope to climb.

**Client**
That makes sense. It's interesting because I'm sure the Abridges, the Nablas, they've built trust on the clinical side. What I'm hearing from you is while you're a bridge between the clinical and the RCM team, the RCM team hasn't worked with Abridge. They don't have any love for it at all. They don't trust it for their use cases. There's no reason to believe they're going to be better than the vendors who've been doing it for 15 years just because they have a great clinical solution.

**Expert**
Correct. I had a conversation three months ago with our team that does coding and that oversees products like potentially NIM and Fathom and AGS have come to them and saying, "Hey, we've got an automated tool. We'll sit on top of your documentation and we'll code everything for you." What was I met with? Some of this is they're worried about staff augmentation. They're worried about the potential audit. All these are valid.

Eighteen months from now, we're going to be facing automated coding on everything that we do. It's inevitable. Are we there yet today? No. Are we overstepping what these products can do at this moment beyond the clinical use? I think so. I think we haven't proven it out at a large enough scale to say, "Hey, this can become an RCM arm of what we do yet." I just don't see it yet. Yes, in the future, but it's a little early in that game right now.

**Client**
Got it. Thank you for taking the time to speak with me. Have a nice day.
