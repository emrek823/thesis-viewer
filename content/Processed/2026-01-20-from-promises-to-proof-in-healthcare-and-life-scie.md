About Event

​There is a massive proof and accountability gap in healthcare AI.

​Rapidly approaching regulations the EU AI Act (Aug 2026), WA AI Task Force recommendations, Colorado AI Act (Jun 2026), make one thing clear:

​AI must be enforceable, measurable, and provable *at the moment of inference.*

​We will have an educational panel and networking to follow.

​Light food and refreshments included.
