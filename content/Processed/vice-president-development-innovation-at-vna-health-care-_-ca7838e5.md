## Summary
VNA Health Care successfully implemented the Abridge medical scribe solution to improve provider efficiency and patient engagement across their primary care and specialty services. Initially met with resistance, the system is now mandatory and well-received by providers, leading to increased efficiency and positive feedback. Abridge provided on-site consultants and virtual trainers to ensure a smooth transition, with the client praising their responsiveness to feedback and noting a significant ROI. Despite considering other providers upon renewal, the Tegus Client has no intentions of switching as they are content with the service provided by Abridge.

## Client
Thanks for taking the call. I am interested in learning more about medical scribe solutions. Could you provide an overview of your background?

---

## Expert
Yeah. Our providers, based on their feedback, spend a lot of time on administrative work, notes, charting, and I want to find a solution that would create more efficiency in the whole charting workflow. Based on patient feedback, many of our patients said that the provider was looking more at their tablet or their laptop and typing versus engaging with them eye-to-eye.

We felt that we needed to find a way to improve the note-taking charging process. That led us to look at these platforms like DeepScribe, Ambience, and Abridge to just really improve the workflow and also improve provider productivity.

## Client
Got you. What sort of organization is VNA Health Care?

## Expert
We are an integrated living network system. We have specialty and primary care clinics, 21 different locations in four states. We also have several hospitals within our IDN. We have home care as well, home health hospice, house calls, and we also have seven post-acute care facilities. We have what that's like four different care settings, and that makes up our IDN.

## Client
Got you. Is that mainly ambulatory, outpatient use cases? Is there no ED or inpatient?

## Expert
We have four hospitals. We have inpatient as well as outpatient as well as care in the home through our home-based services program.

## Client
Makes sense. Where did you look to start using a medical scribe for?

## Expert
We started in our primary care provider space first and then rolled it out to the specialty services. We've only been with our current platform for just about a year now, almost 14 months. The next step will be to roll it out into our hospitals, but the initial launch was with our primary care providers and then we just went into our specialty care providers about six months ago.

## Client
Got you. You ended up choosing Abridge. Is that right?

## Expert
Abridge is our current partner. That's correct.

## Client
Got you. Can you talk us through the pilot process a bit? What was your key criteria on selecting a partner for this?

## Expert
one) It was really critical for the partner to have real-time integration with our current EMR. That was definitely number one on the top criteria selection list. two) We have a high percentage of patients that are Spanish speaking, so we want to make sure that there was no hiccups or delays in the translation from the provider and/or the patient to the patient's chart.

Third was really implementation. Is it user friendly, is it easy for the providers or the nurses to use? Those are really the three basic criteria. Integration again was number one with the EMR but then also making sure

---

there's adequate support for our Spanish-speaking population because we have about maybe 52% of the patients we serve are Spanish speaking.

## Client
Got you. We have here that you evaluated Ambience, DeepScribe, Andy AI, Playback Health, and Nabla. How would you rank those against each other, and why did you end up choosing Abridge?

## Expert
Yeah. If we were to rank top three, I would say Abridge is number one, Ambience is a close second, and then I would say probably DeepScribe would be third. The advantage in my opinion that Abridge has over the others is they also have a pretty strong coding review platform.

Also, during our demonstrations with actual patients, etc., who were Spanish speaking, the accuracy of the translation onto the actual chart was a little better utilizing the Abridge platform versus Ambience and versus DeepScribe. That was really probably the number one reason why we chose Abridge versus the others was the real-time translation and accuracy of what was actually being said to what was being transcribed onto the patient chart that gave Abridge the advantage.

## Client
Got you. Do you measure engagement at all with the clinicians using Abridge?

## Expert
Yeah. Initially, once we were ready to go live, we had a 60-day implementation where the providers were trained and then they were given 45-days to test it out. It was not made mandatory, but then after two months it is now mandatory. We had a soft what I call rollout introduction to the program. They would use the platform here and there.

They had 45 days once they were trained and went live to start using it more often, but it was not mandatory. After two months, it was mandatory that they had to use it. We had a slow introduction rollout, but now, it's used 100% across the entire health system. Initially, again, there was the option to go at their own pace and integrate the system into their practice, utilizing their own comfortable readiness, but it is now 100% utilized across all of the various practices.

## Client
Got you. Was there much pushback when you moved it to make it mandatory?

## Expert
Yeah. Because some of our providers that are very good at note taking, they actually had a scribe with them. It would be the patient, the provider, and maybe typically a nurse or a CNA. That information communication would be scribed or entered into the system by the CNA or the RN, depending. Also, the CNA and RN 90% of the time would be Spanish speaking or another language.

The doctor, if he or she was not bilingual, had another person in there pretty much entering notes for them and then translating. I think when you now roll into a new program or new system where their CNA or their RN partner is no longer in the room with them, and it's just the doctor, the patient, and this platform, there was some uneasiness in terms of, "Okay, would this really work?" I think initially, this is why we gave the providers the chance to slowly roll it into their offering at their speed.

There was definitely some pushback as to, "Why are we doing this? Why can't we keep the CNAs or the RNs in the room? Will the program or the platform actually work?" They're expecting that there'll be a lot of mistakes, mistranslations, things would be omitted but pleasantly surprised that the rollout went really well.

There were still providers that were obviously not happy about having to change, but now that everyone's had a chance to have just about a year under their belt utilizing the system, nothing but praises. Now the feedback is, "Why didn't we do this early on?" Initially, a lot of pushback because they were losing another

---

person that was with them doing most of the work. Now, they have to do a lot of it on their own. There's definitely a lot of resistance early on.

## Client
Got you. As an organization, you moved away from having a second scribe in the room to having them do other stuff. It's just the medical scribe and the patient now in the room.

## Expert
Correct. It's just the platform, it's the patient, and then it is the provider. There are some cases where there might be another person in the room at the patient's request, but that's one out of maybe 25 visits. The two-person team on our side is no longer the model, it's just the platform and the provider and then, of course, the patient that they're caring for.

## Client
Got you. Do you use any dictation software as well like the Dragon solution for Microsoft?

## Expert
We use that early on, and there is a scribe platform, if you're familiar with, our EMR is Epic. There's a scribe-type module within Epic, in my opinion, is just not that robust or expensive. We use some dictation platforms like with Microsoft. In my opinion, the accuracy was not always 100%. Again, if we're talking to a patient that was non-English speaking, the percentage of errors or omissions on the final document, there were always some misses there.

We had utilized some other dictation services and scribes with the EMR and then Microsoft, but then again that became more of a problem than a solution. This is why I decided let's see what else is out there that could really be a total solution from start to finish. We had some other solutions that we use with the dictation, the scribing, but it just was not 100% accurate solution, so we decided to look elsewhere.

## Client
Got you. You're talking about Epic has developed their own scribe technology.

## Expert
Yeah. In the Epic platform EMR, there's an option where it recognizes your voice and the patient's and then it enters the information for you, if you're familiar with the EMR. We used that initially, but it was not that effective because again, there's a lot of misses or hesitation, or you might be speaking and there's nothing being entered by the Epic tablet into the chart.

This is why then we entered into working with Microsoft some type of special dictation to assist. There was improvement, but still there were some gaps. The EMR does have a dictation functionality. We just don't use it anymore. When we did use it, there was unfortunately a fair percentage of errors or omissions on the final chart which became problematic. That's why we moved away from that.

## Client
Got you. You mentioned about six months ago you moved into using Abridge in special piece. How is that rollout gone?

## Expert
Yeah. We have more primary care than specialty care services. We have oncology, pediatrics, cardiology. The thoughts were, "Let's get the primary care providers up and running first. Let's make sure there are any bugs or misses that we could fix it and then roll it out to another group of specialists." It's done very well because we had the primary care providers utilizing Abridge for almost six months, and whatever issues came about which were very little, we were able to fix them.

These now became advocates for the system. When especially providers like the cardiologist or the

---

oncologist started to use Abridge, they already knew what to expect because they were obviously collaborating with their primary care provider partners. It's been very smooth. No hiccups because in some ways, they were already learning how to utilize the system through their primary care partners within their same practice.

Very smooth. The plan was, "Let's utilize the primary care providers first because there's many more of them." It's almost a 2.5, three to one ratio versus specialty provider services team. Now, the specialists have been on board now for just over six months, but it's been flawless and a pretty good implementation and rollout with no issues. Very happy to share that.

## Client
You find that the Abridge solution itself works well to handle those different specialties and those different types of consoles.

## Expert
It does, yeah. With their AI platform, we feed the platform some of the terminology and definitions and phrases they might be used, let's say in oncology versus pediatrics, obviously. What they bring to the table is they've already done their research and homework, and the platform is already populated with various terms and definitions and day-to-day conversation related to, let's say, pediatrics.

When we went live with that, there was just some pre-implementation information we had to share with Abridge to make sure that that would be covered in their platform. Again, it was pretty smooth. The specialty services, depending oncology, pediatrics, whatever they had already in the engine, so to speak, and then what we added to the engine with various terms and terminology worked. Very smooth rollout, no issues, no concerns.

## Client
Awesome. What was the engagement like with the Abridge team throughout the rollout and now?

## Expert
Yeah. They had folks on-site. What we did was again we have 21 locations, so it was a slow rollout. We didn't go all live with all 21 at the same time. There were Abridge on-site consultants or account managers. We also had assistance after hours with trainers on their side virtually. They were available seven days a week. We built a training module and said, "Okay, at the end of the day, depending on the shifts, there might be a virtual wrap-up call at 4:00 P.M., another one at 10:00 P.M., some 3:00 P.M. on Saturday."

There's always on-site folks as well. Of the 21 locations, we rolled out five at a time. Within a month, except for additional clinics, we had all online live. They would go within a week that on-site team to the various clinics. We slowly rolled it out week to week to week to get to the 21 locations. Even today, we built our training module so that if we want to have a monthly or quarterly on-site check-in, we can do that.

We have a quarterly check-in and then we have what we call a monthly JOC meeting where the leaders of the various practices and locations are on the call to share any feedback, what's happening, what's working, what's not. The virtual assistant is always available throughout the day, seven days a week. We don't have as much on-site folks anymore since we've been with them now for 14 months.

Initially, there's a lot of on-site assistance demonstrations, and that coupled with the virtual training after hours really helped. A lot of the training now or follow-up is done virtually. We have a monthly JOC meeting on-site to just address any issues or problems or anything new coming down the pipeline that we need to be aware of. Again, it's been pretty smooth.

We work with them in building that training module because again we have 21 locations, we have different shifts. It isn't if we had just one location where they could just be there for a few days, we had to coordinate with the various shifts and specialty and locations to make sure it was smooth. Again, it's been a pretty solid rollout.

## Client
Got you. To the extent that you find any issues with the platform or are there any features that you'd like to build that would help, how responsive has the Abridge team been to that feedback in shipping out new product?

## Expert
Yeah. The response has really been fantastic. As I mentioned before, we have had no issues at all. Initially, they have a reporting package which is part of their standard offering. For the most part, I'd say nine out of 10 times that reporting package can support the needs of a provider group like us, whether it's hospital or home health or oncology or primary care. We wanted some additional fields to capture that was not part of the reporting package.

We shared that at one of our initial training sessions and then within, I think it was three days, they had that report built into their standard report offering. It measured more like the patient satisfaction component when a patient is winding down with their visit. We didn't really have that as a standard ask in the AI platform, so we added it on there.

Again, it took them two and a half days to add that into the reporting package for us to view online or request at any time. Other than that, everything that they had to offer standard was what exactly what we needed, but their response time to any asks or any ad hoc reports has been really extremely rapid, fast, so no complaints there.

## Client
Got you. Abridge has the recommended status or the recommended vendor status by Epic, how much does that play into your decision-making, and how have you done the integration with Epic?

## Expert
Yeah. The Epic integration, as I mentioned before, the integration with the EMR was definitely priority. Whether it was DeepScribe or Ambience, that was going to be number one. We've looked at some other systems that say that they're like a preferred partner with a specific EHR, whether it be Epic or Cerner. When you do a demo utilizing your own live patients and providers, that is not the case. It's a nice to have that they're a preferred, but it's not a must-have.

At least when we do the demos, we did the same demos with the other groups, DeepScribe. It's a nice-to-have, but it's not a must-have. The big win for the platform was how they could manage in real time with a high level of accuracy those patients that were Spanish speaking and then populate the EMR, whatever view, whether medication or care coordination page on Epic. That was really the big advantage they had. Again, nice to have it as a preferred partner but wasn't really a deal breaker for us if they didn't have that relationship.

## Client
Okay. You said you chose the provider after a demo with your providers and a quick they go through. You got to see a live demo, and that's what you end up choosing the different providers off.

## Expert
We did a demo on DeepScribe, on Ambience, and Abridge, English speaking, other languages, as well as Spanish. This is where in my opinion, just based on the results, Abridge had an advantage in the lesser number of inaccurate notes and less errors. That was very obvious after we did the demo.

## Client
If you had to rate them all out of 10 after demo, how would you rank them?

## Expert
I would say Abridge was probably a 10, Ambience was a nine, and DeepScribe probably would be probably a

---

7/10.

## Client
Cool. Jumping a bit to the billing coding revenue cycle management side of things, you said that the Abridge coding is very accurate. Are you currently using that solution from Abridge?

## Expert
We are, coding review, yes.

## Client
How easy was it to turn on?

## Expert
Yeah. Before we went live with Abridge, we used an external partner and then we had our own internal coders that did review and second review before the actual claim was submitted, before the bill is submitted. It was part of the implementation process. Again, we had the 45 days where the providers could utilize the scribing piece or not, but the coding was always on from day one. The review of the coding was actually pretty seamless because in the past, we had another organization looking at the coding in addition to our internal coders.

It was actually smoother to slip on the coding mechanism than it was to do the scribing. The providers don't see that part. They enter the information, they enter their notes and then the RCM coding component takes place where they look at what the provider said, "He or she did what was recommended and then they pull the providers." If you have a screen, they will choose the appropriate CPT code.

In the past, we would then do a review internally. We sent it off to another group, they would review it internally and then the claim would be submitted. In this case, we just had some manual intervention to oversee, but now, in this example, Abridge, and during the demo, Ambience and DeepScribe, they would review the notes and then they would make sure the code that was entered was accurate and appropriate. In some cases, if a provider missed a code, which we did in the past manually, they would say, wait a minute. this code should be CPT code 894, not 694.

It was pretty seamless because again, the provider is not really involved in the review of the code. Once they enter it, they just move on to the next patient. That switch was turned on on day one, so it was very easy for us to implement because in the past, we just sent it off to somebody else to review. Now, it was all done through the Abridge platform, of course, pulling information from Epic.

## Client
Got you. Do you think that the Abridge solution is good enough to replace those other workflows you have? Are you still sending it to your in-house coders and the off-site platform?

## Expert
Yeah. We don't use the external partner anymore. Now, we have some coders, nowhere near the number of coders we had before. They just do some QI random audits. At one point we had 57 coders. All they did was review codes and check for appropriateness. Now, we have five. Those five will randomly pick a chart and just make sure that the codes are appropriate and accurate. Again, 10 out of 10 times the coding is correct, it's appropriate. We just have people that are checking the checker, so to speak. It went from almost 60 to five. Those five are QI leaders that are just randomly doing these coding audits.

## Client
Got you. It sounds like there's incredible ROI there on that solution. How is Abridge charging for that? How are you thinking about that ROI internally?

## Expert

---

Yeah. This is our first venture into having an external partner help us with some of the dictation and describing. We had external partners helping with the coding, and of course, we had our own internal core. What we negotiated a flat admin fee, which is not standard operating in terms of scheduling because typically, an Abridge or Ambience or DeepScribe will charge per user, per seat. I didn't really want to go down that path. I just wanted to have a flat admin fee. We gave them the number of claims and patients we see on a regular basis over a two-year timeframe.

They saw the number of claims that we submitted over 24 months and then we came up to an agreement with a flat admin fee. If I just look at that admin fee, which is X and I look at the provider productivity which is measured on how many patients a provider was able to see from start to finish prior to Abridge and what they see today, and I look at our receivables and the percentage of claims that were denied prior to Abridge and today and also the percentage of claims that were miscoded or not coded appropriately, before and today, I come up with an ROI.

So far, the ROI after just 14 months is about 3.5 to one. Now, when we go in for renewal that flat admin fee probably will go away because my thoughts were let's take it out for a spin, let's see how it works. We've never used this technology before with AI oversight. Let's have a flat fee for the term of our contract. That's why it's very manageable from a budget standpoint. Once the term ends, we can have more experience and then look at maybe a flat fee for support of the platform.

We have a fee based on the number of users i.e., speech licenses. As of right now, the way it's set up, and it's a sweet deal for us to be transparent, I don't know if others had the same type of schedule, what the percentage is, but the ROI is just about 3.5 to one, which is incredible because we expected after about one year, it would be closer to about 2.7 to one. You can see we've surpassed that.

## Client
The ROI is very strong, but what's driving that is the fact that we have an admin fee annually versus we have a fee based on users or seats which can go up and down depending how many users you have. It is definitely a friendly contract for us, but again, once our term contract ends, we will probably have to go to some hybrid type model because the admins fee may not work for them but definitely works for us today.

When you do come up for that renewal, will you be looking at other providers again, or is it more, "We're just going to look at pricing with Abridge because we're pretty happy with the service?"

## Expert
Yeah, I have no intentions of making a switch. We will look at the terms of the contract in terms of the financials and the fees and the reimbursement, but no, there would be no interest at this point to switch providers. It would just be the relook at the contractual terms related to payment and fees.

## Client
Thank you so much for your time. It's been super helpful. Have a great day.
