## Key Feedback

### 1. Revenue trajectory is real but customer concentration is dangerous.

90%+ of current ARR ($127K annualized) was captured in the last 60 days, driven primarily by CZ Law. While January projects $25-35K (135-175% MoM growth), CZ Law's 500 monthly requests will represent the majority. Need 2-3 more anchor customers before this looks like repeatable revenue vs. a single deal.

### 2. Site Sonar has clear product-market fit.

66% gross margin, 90% hit rate, 76% claims encounter coverage, turnaround dropped from 7 days to 12 hours. Customers are using it as described (Chart Squad testimonial: "massive disruptor that will fill the void FHIR and TEFCA have left"). The wedge is working.

### 3. Network effects are beginning to manifest.

Klein Guard law firm is now waiting for vendors to join Hermes network rather than contracting directly - the first instance of customers preferring network membership over direct relationships. This is the signal that neutrality matters.

### 4. The "why now" story finally landed.

Updated deck includes: (a) neutral networks got acquired (Chartswap to Ontellus 2019, Clareto to MIB 2025), (b) TEFCA excludes non-treatment use cases, (c) AI needs identified data, (d) AI automates labor that previously made this a services business, (e) shift from de-identified to identified data.

### 5. Data source coverage is building faster than projected.

Original 2025 targets: 20% medical records automation. Actual progress: MRO API access, Veritas integrated, Waystar contracted, Anovolon ($10K + $3.30/patient for 150M records), Office Ally imminent, ShareCare live. Combined claims coverage approaching 80%.

### 6. Fundraising momentum is strong but timing risk exists.

Torch term sheet creates leverage, but "waiting until after break" responses from investors need conversion in the 45-day window. 12+ investors in pipeline but velocity matters more than breadth at this stage.

### 7. Unit economics are favorable but manual ops remain.

Site Sonar: $15 charge / $5 cost = 66% margin. Record retrieval: $50 charge / ~$30 cost = 40% margin currently, improving as direct ROI connections increase. But CZ Law deal required 2 ops staff at $70K each - not yet "software eating services."

### 8. SOC 2 timeline slipped but acceptable.

Target was December 15, 2025; now tracking to January (Type I) and June (Type II). This gates EHR integrations - 15 EHRs pending SOC 2 completion per latest pipeline.

## Open Questions

### Business Model & Unit Economics
- What is the true fully-loaded cost per record including ops labor? The $50 charge with 2 FTEs at $70K suggests lower margin than claimed 50%.
- How does margin evolve as direct EHR connections come online (Q2 2026)? The $8-12 cost / $50 sell claim needs validation.
- What is the path to removing manual ops entirely? Current CZ Law setup requires dedicated staff.

### Customer Concentration
- What happens if CZ Law churns or reduces volume during the "testing" phase they initiated in December?
- Who are the next 3 customers that can match CZ Law's volume (500 requests/month)?
- Is the 70% demo-to-customer conversion rate sustainable at scale?

### Competitive Dynamics
- How will Datavant respond to Hermes taking CZ Law from their ecosystem? Alejandro's departure creates information asymmetry risk.
- The Athena-Datavant partnership memo shows EHRs moving to capture ROI economics - does this accelerate or slow Hermes's data source expansion?
- ChartSwap was acquired by Ontellus in 2019, Clareto by MIB in 2025 - who else is watching this space?

### Technology & Operations
- SOC 2 Type I slipped from December 15 to January - what's the actual completion confidence?
- 15 EHRs pending SOC 2 - how long after certification to integration?
- The Veritas data "missing 2025 data" issue - is this resolved?

### Fundraising
- Torch committed $1.8M - is this final or subject to conditions?
- What's the actual list of "12+ investors in pipeline" and where is each in process?
- JPM conference agenda (Jan 12-15) - which investor meetings are confirmed vs. hoped for?

---

## What We Can Help With

### 1. Investor introductions for the 45-day sprint
Virtue to provide 6 additional prospect introductions beyond current pipeline. Priority: investors who can move quickly post-term sheet.

### 2. JPM conference coordination
Monday-Thursday agenda optimization. Which investors need in-person vs. can be video? Live meeting scheduling.

### 3. Customer pipeline introductions
Codes Health (YC company) expressed interest - Austin Mills wants Hermes for Sonar and patient histories. Infrastructure play resonates with builders who don't want to rebuild record retrieval.

### 4. Reference validation
Travis (Datavant board member) providing strong backing. Mark Karsh positive back-channel. Can amplify these with other investors who need conviction.

### 5. Competitive intelligence
Datavant expert call memo provides detailed operational intel ($100M P&L, 260 staff, $0.25/page pricing). Morgan & Morgan call shows how sophisticated buyers evaluate vendors. Share these with other investors for credibility.

## Bottom Line

### What's Working
- **Product-market fit in Site Sonar is real.** 90% hit rate, 66% margin, 12-hour turnaround from 7 days. Customers testimonials are enthusiastic.
- **The neutrality positioning is differentiating.** HIEs serve treatment only. Datavant owns Ontellus. MIB acquired Clareto. There is no neutral player for non-treatment use cases.
- **Data source traction exceeds expectations.** MRO API access (first ever), Waystar contracted, Anovolon near-final with 150M records. Claims coverage approaching 80%.
- **Term sheet in hand creates leverage.** Torch at $1.8M anchors the round. "Waiting until after break" investors now need to make decisions.

### What Needs Sharpening
- **Customer concentration is the immediate risk.** CZ Law drives most of the $127K ARR. January's $25-35K projection depends heavily on one customer committing volume.
- **Manual operations still required at scale.** The vision is software, but CZ Law deal required 2 ops FTEs. Path to automation unclear for record retrieval (vs. Site Sonar which is already automated).
- **SOC 2 gates the EHR expansion.** 15 EHRs waiting on certification. Timeline slipped once. This is critical path for the 70% medical records automation target.
- **Fundraising is not closed.** $2.2M remaining to fill. 45-day sprint started. JPM timing creates pressure but also opportunity.

### Bull Case
The AI era shifts the bottleneck from data organization back to raw data access. LLMs commoditize cleaning and analysis; access becomes scarce. Hermes is building the neutral rails for identified health data in a market where the two previous neutral players got acquired and lost neutrality. First-mover with network effects = durable moat. $10B TAM in non-treatment use cases, 145M record requests/year. Site Sonar wedge already works; expand to Patient Histories and Fast Lane. Datavant's own analyst says EHRs will disintermediate ROI vendors - Hermes benefits from that chaos as the neutral middleware layer.

### Bear Case
Customer concentration is dangerous - if CZ Law churns, ARR drops to near-zero. The "neutral middleware" play has been tried before (ChartSwap, Clareto) and both got acquired into non-neutral positions - what's different this time? Datavant could respond aggressively to Alejandro's departure and customer wins. SOC 2 delays could stall EHR expansion. The $50/record retrieval margin depends on ops staff that don't scale. Fundraising in January with holiday momentum could stall if the 45-day sprint doesn't close - runway runs out June 2025.

---

**Priority: HIGH**
Fundraise is time-critical. Revenue momentum is real but fragile. Network effects beginning but not locked in. The 45-day sprint determines whether Hermes scales or stalls.
