## Slide 3

Enabling biopharma to move at the speed of software

Why haven’t we seen a new pharma giant in decades? The Mag7 is on average just 33 years old, yet most top biopharma were founded in the 1800s.

Biopharma has long required massive capital and expert networks, forcing biotechs into acquisition before reaching scale. That’s changing. As software takes on the role of experts, a new generation of AI-native pharma giants will emerge. These companies won’t run on legacy tech or rely on an army of consultants. 

They will operate on Solstice.

## Slide 11

COMPETITION

Building tech is not their competency

Face the innovator’s dilemma. Will they disrupt their own business model?

Only solve a very small part of workflow
Pharma likes pharma specific solutions (see Veeva)

This is a real threat 
Very important for us to build our ecosystem outside of Veeva

…

We are the only technology built for pharma, without 
the baggage of an existing business model

Short-term we differentiate on pharma-specific product superiority

Long-term we differentiate by becoming a system of record

---

## Slide 12

We compound value by learning taste and aggregating data both within a brand and across the industry

Company-Level

Data aggregation
As a company, Solstice aggregates data on one brand and how its content performs to optimize performance.
Trust growth
By optimizing performance, we earn the trust of more brands and aggregate data on how they perform.

Optimization flywheel
As a company as now more data on content and how it performs so we are better at optimizing content performance. This helps us earn the trust of even more brands.

Brand-Level

Taste learning
With one brand, we learn “taste” from content and compliance perspective

Usage expansion
This earns the trust of a brand, so they use to create more content for them and more variety

Deepened trust
We learn their preferences across a broader swath of content and can showcase our value across the brand, so they trust us even more and keep using us

DEFENSIBILITY

## Slide 13

We can get to $50mm ARR with our current clients and current product

ACV for Large: $10M+

Brand expansion

Product expansion

Serve one brand then expand across portfolio

Expand across region/enterprise

YOUR BET

You are betting on our ability to expand within an organization and sufficiently productize

Now that we’ve landed can we expand? 
It’s a necessity to built a generational company

Can we sufficiently productize? 
Otherwise, we risk becoming an agency.
