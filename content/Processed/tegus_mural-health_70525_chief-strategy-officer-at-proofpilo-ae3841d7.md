## Mural Health - Chief Strategy Officer at ProofPilot
### Interview conducted on September 27, 2023

### Topics
Clinical Trials, Patient Payments, Site Payments, Healthcare Industry, Greenphire, Clinical Trial Automation, Patient Engagement

### Summary
The Tegus Client spoke with the Chief Strategy Officer at ProofPilot about the clinical trial landscape and patient payments. ProofPilot is a clinical trial automation software that integrates various technology and tasks for sites and patients. They use Greenphire and Mural Health for payments, with Greenphire being a longer-standing solution. ProofPilot serves as an integrator for various technology solutions and partners with Greenphire and Mural Health to automate activities and ensure compliance. The Chief Strategy Officer believes that Mural Health offers more value with its wider variety of payment options and mobile payment capabilities compared to Greenphire. They also discuss the importance of patient engagement and retention, as well as the potential value of clear accounting reconciliation, better communication, and analytics in clinical trials. The Chief Strategy Officer suggests that an open ecosystem and easy integration with other solutions could differentiate Mural Health. They also note that Mural was faster to work with compared to Greenphire.

**Tegus Client**
Hello, thank you so much for taking the time to meet with me today. So we've been spending a lot of time across the clinical trial landscape and specifically patient payments and kind of site payments and the ecosystem around that with regards to retaining and kind of making sure that your participants are staying throughout the length of the trial.

Wanted to kind of pick your brain on how you see solutions like Greenphire and Mural Health, what you're using today, kind of why you're using it and kind of what are the priorities for you and for ProofPilot in terms of evaluating these types of tools. I guess to start, I would love to get a sense of your background, your role, kind of what jobs kind of sit under you and then would love to get a sense of ProofPilot and the general scope

of your business.

**Chief Strategy Officer at ProofPilot**
So my background, as in 23 years and counting, of clinical research, mostly working on the pharma side of things. So I started my career at Merck, I did two tours of duty there, spent some time at Shire and then moved into Lilly for the last eight years of my pharma research career. That's where I started to focus more on clinical innovation, which would include modernizing the clinical research landscape in every facet possible.

But I spent the last three years of my career at Lilly in digital health, a lot of wearable sensor work, direct to patient, different kinds of research with different kinds of aims, but still clinical research, nonetheless. But we have a little bit more freedom to operate. And that's where I actually became a customer of ProofPilot first, and I joined right after their Series B raise.

So just real quick to understand ProofPilot because it's important in terms of how we use Greenphire and Mural. ProofPilot is a clinical trial automation software. So if you think of it like a Google maps for research. Turn-by-turn directions on tasks, content, APIs, triggering, alerts, so on and so forth.

So it becomes like the backbone of all the disparate technology and tasks that either sites or patients have to do. So my role at ProofPilot as Chief Strategy Officer. It's just the name that I do a little bit of everything, product, thought leadership, marketing, sales, all that sort of stuff.

I've used Greenphire for a longer time than Mural, obviously, because they've been around for a long time. I was one of Greenphire's first customers, continue to use Greenphire at ProofPilot And also Mural because they're new on the scene, I use Mural as well. So I'm familiar with both products.

**Tegus Client**
I guess just to get a sense for ProofPilot. Like what kind of customers do you have? What kind of sites are you working on? Is there a specific focus where you operate?

**Chief Strategy Officer at ProofPilot**
Yes. The legacy of the company was anyone who wanted to do research. So this could be health and wellness, med device, academic and pharma. Post the Series B raise, we focus only on life science now. So pharma, med device, digital health, just to concentrate, that's where the money is, and we can scale much faster. So that's our customer base. So same as Greenphire and Mural.

**Tegus Client**
Who's typically using the platform? And who's kind of making the decision-making process from the site CRO sponsor point of view?

**Chief Strategy Officer at ProofPilot**
Yes, as with all things in pharma research, it's a committee buy but it falls under clinical operations.

**Tegus Client**
Who is the actual end user of the software, though, not the buyer?

**Chief Strategy Officer at ProofPilot**
The end user would be the operators of the protocol, or the participants. So it will be the site personnel and the patients. So for example, and this actually happened to me when I was in Moderna's trial, I had to do a bunch of saliva samples and call the site and let them know it's coming in. And it was a big old mess.

So in that case, I would be the user of the platform where it would guide me on exactly how to do things. When I was done, it would trigger the shipment to happen instead of me texting a bunch of people. And once that thing was picked up, I could get a micro payment to myself, right? So it automates all those different activities, so there's no human beings. Trying to make sense of it all.

**Tegus Client**
And is ProofPilot an actual customer of Mural Health and Greenphire, I just wanted to clarify that.

**Chief Strategy Officer at ProofPilot**
Yes. We bought both of their products, and we'll continue to as the needs are relevant.

**Tegus Client**
And help us understand why you were a customer and how each of those products integrates with ProofPilot?

**Chief Strategy Officer at ProofPilot**
Yes. So more and more our customers, the pharma companies who are running these trials, they themselves as well as sites and patients, they can't handle the tech proliferation. So there's all these different portals that do all these different things. And to the extent these things can be automatically triggered, activities can be automatically triggered in these things.

That's why they rely on ProofPilot. So we don't do the payments. And we don't want to do the payments. We don't do ePRO. We don't want to do ePRO. But as the tech proliferation happens, you need something to pull it all together and trigger them off one another.

So when certain customers will come to us directly, as kind of the integrator of all these things then it's incumbent upon us to then find the right partners who can work with us, those being Mural and Greenphire, particularly in the payment space. So here's a specific use case. If a patient has to do a series of daily and weekly diaries, we will serve them up. And as those things are completed, we can push an API call to Mural or Greenphire and get that person paid according to their compliance.

**Tegus Client**
Does that mean that ProofPilot must be a customer of any software solutions?

**Chief Strategy Officer at ProofPilot**
No, it doesn't have to be, yes. So it depends on the orientation of how the sponsor has hired us. So if they hire us to be kind of the centerpiece of it all and expect us to go source all these other partners, then yes, we become the customer of all these other partners. It's worked both ways where the sponsor says, I have all these partners, can you make sense of them. And then in which case, we're not a customer, we would just be a partner. So we could absolutely come to the table as a partner of Mural Health and Greenphire and not owe each other money.

**Tegus Client**
It almost sounds like you're just a more tech-savvy CRO. Is that an incorrect way to think about it?

**Chief Strategy Officer at ProofPilot**
It's not an incorrect way, but it actually goes down to the granular level of helping the folks at the site do what they need to do. So here's another very simple use case, but plagues the industry. When a patient screen fails at a clinic, typically, there's a human being, the site coordinator, has to go update all the other portals to say that this person has screen failed.

Because they're human, they forget, and they don't do it all. So now you have all these other companies calling that individual, to remember, don't forget to update this portal. Like this happens literally everywhere. So one thing we would do is, we would build an API with the IRT. And when we get a ping that patient 1001 screen failed, we would then trigger a series of workflows that helps the study coordinator go update everything, right?

Go here. And this way, as long as they have half a brain, they're not going to miss a step. Because it's always going to be something they have to do. And that's just one sort of minor but it creates a ton of churn. But imagine the more complicated things, which is like, hey, you have to do this procedure before you do this one. And the instructions to do that are ill-delivered. Every site around the world has to deal with disparate

resources and they have to sort of stitch this together and interpret it, which is kind of crazy because what is science, but making sure everything is done this way. If you can't do it that way, you're not even really doing fine.

**Tegus Client**
And then I guess as you think about the breadth of your customers, let's call it, you have 100, like how many of them or those kind of sites trials are using Greenphire versus Mural versus a different solution from what you've seen?

**Chief Strategy Officer at ProofPilot**
The bulk of them are using Greenphire only because Mural's new in the market, right? They only just started last year. And Greenphire has been around for a long time at this point. So the bulk of it is Greenphire. But listen, there's still plenty of people like using gift cards or other sorts of, I would say, products that are not purposeful for clinical research, but certainly kind of good enough to pay patients.

**Tegus Client**
And if you had to a ballpark even a range of percentages, what would you say kind of you see Greenphire, you see these homegrown solutions versus Mural's probably 10%?

**Chief Strategy Officer at ProofPilot**
It is tough to say but I'll put a stake in the sand. I might say, 60% of patient payments are Greenphire, 35% are a wide variety of other bit players or off-the-shelf gift cards and then I don't know, they're probably still in the single-digit percentage market share for sure.

**Tegus Client**
Mural, yes?

**Chief Strategy Officer at ProofPilot**
Yes, they just started.

**Tegus Client**
As you think about that similar breakdown, when you're coming into one of your clients, how many of them already have like an existing agreement or preferred vendor like a Greenphire and how many of them are asking you to be that vendor onboarding and kind of sourcing portion?

**Chief Strategy Officer at ProofPilot**
Yes, most people have a relationship with Greenphire that we've encountered. But it's not like an incumbent that they're dedicated to. It's more so the case when it comes to site payments that people are not switching back and forth. So for patient payments, there is more flexibility there for sure. But most people have heard of Greenphire and have used them either widely or commonly or maybe even as the default, but it's not like they can't switch.

**Tegus Client**
And with what's the general appetite to changing? You mentioned it's harder to switch site payments rather than patient payments. From your experience, with Mural Health new to the market, what is the appetite to change or to evaluate or consider switching to something like that from a Greenphire or another smaller player or nonpurpose-built solution?

**Chief Strategy Officer at ProofPilot**
Yes. It's interesting. I think the appetite is there. They're going to look at price. From where I stand, I think Mural is more expensive. That doesn't mean they don't add more value. So the value that they bring to bear is really around the different models of payments that they can support. Greenphire is really focused on the debit card or the virtual debit card, which is good and bad. It's a simple thing to understand, there's less

overhead. But there are some hidden fees that if they're not well articulated can really sour the patient and the sponsor and the sites.

Mural Health has a wider variety of payment sets like Venmo, Cash App, PayPal, so on and so forth. So they've kind of gotten to more of the mobile payments, it's more inclusive and it's, in some ways, better set for growth in the long term because people are going to continue to be moving towards that.

Not like the debit card market is growing. It is what it is, and it's these other things that are growing. So the idea of having that flexibility is, I think, key. But at face value, they're both expensive. So it's a bit of a hurdle to help people understand why they're paying so much more to do this than just handing off debit cards.

**Tegus Client**
And when you say Mural Health, like they're comparable in price, like what is a rough amount that people are typically spending? I know it varies widely.

**Chief Strategy Officer at ProofPilot**
It's really hard to articulate. Mural Health is actually more expensive to be clear. I don't want to make sure you came up with that. There's a lot of weird fees, it's hard for me to wrap my head around. There are these banking fees that are monthly. There are site fees that are monthly.

There are patient fees that are monthly. And because patient enrollment, it's not like 100 people start on day one and they all stop on day 30. It's a rolling enrollment. So any given day, you have a different number of patients using system. So some of the pricing model can be confusing, and that's for both companies. I wish it were more straightforward.

**Tegus Client**
And when you say Mural Health is more expensive, how are you sort of backing into that if these pricing arrangements are complicated? And to what degree are they more expensive?

**Chief Strategy Officer at ProofPilot**
Yes. Well, I've gone RFPs to them both, and I say, well, Mural is expensive and even though the value is there if I bring both value sets to the customer, I have been in situations where one of them is like, I get the value but I'm not willing to pay for that. So I'll accept lower value at this lower cost. So it depends on the scenario, it depends on the customer. To what degree is it more expensive, they could even out at larger scales, but the few examples I have, it might be 30% more. That's just the ballpark.

**Tegus Client**
And then one kind of quick question on kind of how you guys are evaluating these solutions and partnering. How did you first meet Mural? And I guess as you think about why they exist and some of the value you mentioned that they have given the price that they're charging. Like how do you think about the differentiation? What got you excited about partnering with them and kind of bringing them into your sites that you're working on?

**Chief Strategy Officer at ProofPilot**
Well, Sam started Greenphire, Sam Whitaker, the CEO and so he started Mural. So it's the same guy. So I've known Sam through the years as he built up Greenphire and now because I'm in his Rolodex, he, of course, reached out, and I was in buying position, pitched me on the idea. I think the idea is it was definitely worth trying.

Sam has a track record of building a patient payment company in clinical research, right, what a niche. So that was really the motivation. I knew he would get it "right." I can't speak to the wider market, but personally, that was the rationale. But Greenphire still remains to be a great product, so I'm not going to be stupid there.

**Tegus Client**

I guess like on that point, like what in your mind are kind of the things that Greenphire could improve or lack in today that Mural has the opportunity to kind of wedge in and build a better product?

**Chief Strategy Officer at ProofPilot**
I remember saying this to Sam, while he was still at Greenphire like you really need to think about mobile payments. So I guess he took it to heart. So it's really about keeping pace with the modern world. I can't point to evidence, but there's a claim that there are hidden fees in Greenphire that the patient might need to absorb if they're not well educated on how to use that product, for example.

And I'm getting this wrong, but I think you'll understand. For example, if the patient doesn't use the funds on the card within x amount of months, they get charged $4. Now while that might not be a lot, there's two things that's problematic with that. Just setting the expectation, whether it's $4 or $40, nobody wants to be hit with fees.

Secondly, there's something called the informed consent. And if you say someone is going to get $10 and they end up with $8, you've actually just violated that document, which is, for all intents and purposes, a legal document to some degree. So what Mural is trying to bring forward is, I think, zero patient fees. So that money is always there in perpetuity and more flexible ways to pay.

I think there's other integrations, which I think Greenphire also has with transportation and kind of a concierge service. Now to what extent Mural is truly all SaaS and software-based versus Greenphire having people behind the scenes, work out the kinks and move activities from one spreadsheet to another, I don't know now. And the third thing I'll say is, I think the business model of Mural Health might be a little bit more friendly to resellers versus Greenphire. Those things haven't been offered as products, but I think that's just the sort of the feeling I get.

**Tegus Client**
I guess it's a little different from you being more of a technology partner in this. But like how do you think about the value prop that Mural is driving? Is it in that mobile experience and that customer engagement or patient engagement and retention to kind of increase the retention of the patients and kind of increase their drive to kind of bring data back and attribute that back to the sponsor? Or is it really on just kind of the cost savings, the payment modality? How do you think about that?

**Chief Strategy Officer at ProofPilot**
I'm still struggling with it. It's kind of like Uber and Lyft. Like really what's the difference really. But everyone kind of defaults to Uber, even me, even though Lyft might be a friendlier company or whatever. Riders don't think about, oh, there's 50% more drivers out there. It's not what goes on in their heads. I think people just go to Uber.

Maybe it's just first-mover advantage. So yes, I'm still trying to think about what the real difference is there. To me on some level, it is a commodity. You must pay patients. It's part of what we have to do, being able to offer three payment model versus one. Does that really get Pfizer excited? I don't know. I think there needs to be a little bit more data to show that, for example, I'm not saying they're doing this.

This is maybe something they should do. But there's always talk about diversity and inclusion. And to the extent that a wider population has less banked folks and need these mobile payment options because that's all they have, if they can show that this creates a more inclusive trial experience, great. Then you have like another lever that's not commodity-based sort of thing based on price but price is the same.

**Tegus Client**
We've heard that with Greenphire a lot of the time, even with the transportation module that they have that you're typically not getting your dollars back on your card for two to seven days. And so for people that truly don't have cash to get to a site or kind of want that immediate payment, they're not getting it. And so ideally, you would open up a few more segments of that demographic.

**Chief Strategy Officer at ProofPilot**

It depends on the trial. If the trial is sort of light and people don't have to drive there as much, transportation becomes a moot point. So again, it's kind of trial by trial in terms of value.

**Tegus Client**
And then I guess is your experience from Merck and Eli Lilly and even your current role, what's like the industry average patient retention that you see after like six months, one year, two years? Like what's average, what's good, what's bad from your experience?

**Chief Strategy Officer at ProofPilot**
So think of it sort of differently. If you need 100 patients to evaluate, you will enroll 120 because you'll lose the 20%, maybe 30%, right? The bulk of that 20 and 30 overage is when they drop out, the bulk of that is because the drug doesn't work or they're getting side effects.

So that might be 2/3 of them. And that 1/3 that are dropping out because of a variety of reasons, right? They don't have a time anymore. This is more than they bargained for. They're embarrassed to say they're sick, whatever it is. There's a whole bunch of other. So there are like actual five or six reasons officially that get reported to the FDA why people drop out. Again, top two, lack of efficacy, AEs and that accounts for 60%, 66% of dropouts.

**Tegus Client**
That 66%, so you're saying the 1/3 is potentially, so of the 30, call it 10 are dropping out because of the time commitment, embarrassment, just not being happy with the trial. Yes?

**Chief Strategy Officer at ProofPilot**
Yes.

**Tegus Client**
At what point in a trial, does the data get in question, like what dropout rate is starting to get a little concerning from your point of view?

**Chief Strategy Officer at ProofPilot**
So if it's more than what's expected. So like I said, every statistician, I need 100 patients, let's enroll 130. If it goes below that 100, we're in trouble because they've already accounted for that. More than that, though, if you got all 130 to stay in, if they're not compliant, you could also take a big ding, right? So just because they stay in the trial, they're not answering half the questions. That's pretty bad.

**Tegus Client**
And do you see, I guess, like if Mural Health starts to kind of show the ROI on that retention, that 1/3 of retention that's caused by random drop off, if they're engaging the patients, if they are kind of making sure they're getting paid and updated correctly, and that shows a pretty significant increase in participant retention, how do you think about the value of that?

**Chief Strategy Officer at ProofPilot**
Yes, it's a concept we struggle with at ProofPilot. And having been on the other side, it's a tall order to say any one thing is improving patient retention, particularly of that 1/3 particularly because it's a grab bag, and these things work synergistically. So for example, if I get paid on time, that's great.

That will not take the place of just a set of tasks that's too burdensome, right, or too awkward I'm failing at. So that payment doesn't overcome burden. At the same time, something super easy to do. And payment is not like a big deal. Payment is not going to move the needle one way or the other.

Now certainly, you want them all to be good, like good support, good education, no confusion, paid on time Actually, we're doing a presentation with Mural Health at a conference coming up to think about this holistically around automating a lot of things versus making the patient go chase after it. So we think it's a

Tegus

combination of all of it. To your question, yes, of course, if they could show that ROI, 100%. Can they do it that can pass the scrutiny of scientists to read this kind of data all the time, I don't know. It's hard.

**Tegus Client**
Moving away from the actual payments and transportation experience to the more sort of participant focused, we've also heard that there are a lot of benefits for the sponsors, the clinical research sites, the CROs in terms of a more clear accounting reconciliation, so making it easier and faster to basically account for all of the expenses in the trial to match those against the budget.

So that's something that we've heard. We've also heard that it enables better communication where sponsors actually have visibility into potential applicants falling out. And then just like analytics and kind of dashboards that give insights into different elements of the trial on a patient-by-patient or site-by-site basis. How do you think about the value proposition of those types of offerings based on your experience in the industry?

**Chief Strategy Officer at ProofPilot**
Yes. I think people will take some benefit where they can get it. But it's kind of like getting a 10% decrease on your electric bill, but your mortgage is still high. So yes, I'll take it, but it's not solving like the central pain point of things. So all good. I don't want to discount it too much, but I also don't want to position it better than it is.

To the extent that some of these analytics are predictive versus descriptive, I think it's more descriptive. I don't think there's anyone who can say, "Oh, I'm seeing these analytics, there's a 90% chance this patient will drop out or stay in. And therefore, I should intervene this way." There's no science really around that yet.

**Tegus Client**
So you're saying if they could do something more on the predictive side and that's sort of prompting potential interventions to proactively avoid dropout that could be compelling, but you don't think that's the technology or capability they have today.

**Chief Strategy Officer at ProofPilot**
Well, let's say it does exist today. It's going to be disease-specific likely, trial-specific, trial-type specific likely. And it's going to take probably a year to see that happen. So again, if you're going to report this back out to the science community, you're going to need to have kind of like really good watertight data.

It doesn't have to be to the extent that you're writing up the drug results. But you can't just say, "Oh, we did the study and like 10 of these patients did this and 30 of them did that like you should bank on us." It's probably not going to be good enough. So you're going to want to see a whole trial through and trials take nine months to a year to enroll, then everyone has to finish and everyone needs to be looked at sort of equally. So that could be done if they started today, you'd be waiting at least a year for the results.

**Tegus Client**
On like Mural Health, just generally, if you're kind of sitting in Sam's seat, like what's the wedge, what's the pain point to go after either from a go-to-market product perspective to wedge in and kind of take a decent chunk of market share from Greenphire. Because it seems like they're pretty embedded, people are fine with it, it does the job and just kind of curious your thoughts on how this becomes a big business like Greenphire?

**Chief Strategy Officer at ProofPilot**
Well, fortunately, Sam knows Greenphire intimately and those all the sort of weaknesses and areas. But outside of that, I think people are sort of sick and tired of siloed solutions. They accept the tech proliferations out of control and won't stop. There's never going to be a one system that does everything. So if they can be more friendly to integrate with a bunch of other sorts of solutions that can play off of each other without fear.

I think that's a really interesting way for them to grow beyond Greenphire. They used to be kind of like a fast and loose like open company, but they've been around a while. Now they're the incumbent. So they can play

close to the vest. We'll see what other integrations they might be interested in. They just released the new product, I think, which might be competing with us.

So there's a lot of overlap of all these different technologies. And if you can just be great at this one thing and then integrate with other good providers, tech or services, that might be the secret because I've been on the sponsor side, and I've tried to get two tech players to play together, and the one who resist, it sours everything. When they say yes together, it just really opens up innovation and stickiness because you don't want to go back to a player who's like resistant to play nice in the sandbox with somebody else.

**Tegus Client**
I guess, like just to kind of read that back to you, like if you were to think about Mural's potential for differentiation today, is it really that open ecosystem and kind of playing with other partners while connecting into their systems and kind of using them as a go-to-market to a degree, which is kind of what you guys have done for some of your customers?

**Chief Strategy Officer at ProofPilot**
Yes. And so if you think about like the world of HubSpot and Slack and all these things are kind of just integrating, you can buy what you want, integrate them and then make them work with each other, right? Then like Sam doesn't even need a sales force, right? If you can make it so it's really easy to connect his technology to other things that people want to do, then it's just a small dev team and from customer service and he doesn't have to sell. I would love to go to a Greenphire website, pick the product I want, connect it to my things and just go.

Like as you as a partner of Greenphire and Mural, like as you've been hooking your system into theirs and making that triggered experience for the sites. How is the partnership and kind of working with each differentiated?

**Chief Strategy Officer at ProofPilot**
Mural is just faster because they're smaller, right? I know a lot of guys still at Greenphire, and when I moved to ProofPilot, I actually reached out to them first to say, "Hey, let's combine forces here. Here's how it would work." And then Sam came to me later after he started this company and I got moving with Mural faster, like it was crazy.

**Tegus Client**
How much faster like from initial combo to a having the keys started and all that good stuff.

**Chief Strategy Officer at ProofPilot**
I was waiting on Greenphire for probably 13 months. Like I've been here for almost two years. With Sam, it probably took two months. I think Greenphire will be quicker now that we've been working with them, but I will say at the jump, it was longer. So I don't want to overstate that but anyway.

Awesome. Thank you so much for chatting. Really appreciate it. Have a good one.
