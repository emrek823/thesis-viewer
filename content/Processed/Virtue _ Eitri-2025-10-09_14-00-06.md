### Talent Pipeline Update

- Cranking on the process - generally good progress with 4 people furthest in pipeline
	- Zach (case study completed, meeting tomorrow 11am Eastern)
	- Pierre (case study scheduled Monday)
	- Steve and John (technical screens Wednesday)
- All A-players with specific coaching areas needed - nobody flawless
	- Coachability around proactivity on product ideation strongest signal missing
	- Exceptionally competent when given technical challenges to run with
- Zach concerns:
	- Indexing heavily on equity, explicitly asked about co-founder role
	- Quinn’s view: not right candidate for that - missing proactivity/vision-setting
	- Would offer ~5% equity + ~$200k cash (similar to previous candidate)
	- Zach may want formal guarantee/milestone-based equity grants
- Alloy team producing ~3 candidates/week
	- Volume lower than expected but high quality
	- Both technical screen candidates came through Ryan’s team

### Product Focus - Batch Disposition Wedge

- Wedge use case: extension of batch outcome data visualization started with Skylark
- Batch disposition process:
	- Clinical stage and commercial manufacturing batches finished at CDMO
	- Quality/technical teams decide if batch suitable for intended use (dosing patients)
	- Compare quantitative test data (assays) to specs and regulatory requirements
	- Manual process review of batch records (often paper-based PDFs)
- Product approach: ingest all data, guide users through review flow
	- Do quantitative comparisons automatically
	- Highlight documents needing review attention
	- Output report showing quality issues and batch record items requiring second look
- ICP evolution: more quality involvement than initially expected
	- Key user/buyer likely VP or Head of Quality (vs just CMC/technical ops)
	- Challenge: Quality is cost center - budget/line item questions
- Target modality: Cell & gene therapy sector stands out
	- Process particularly hard - lots of batches (1 batch per patient)
	- Sector having tough time currently but still promising
- Competitive landscape: mostly competing against manual human processes
	- Some tools like Viva batch release exist in similar shape

### Near-Term Priorities & Timeline

- October/November goals:
	- Sell or set aside batch disposition use case
	- Get proof of concept in front of prospects for clear yes/no signal
	- Either LOI-type commitment or clear feedback on why it’s not mission-critical
- Rebuilding momentum after August hiring focus and September reset
	- Sequence: 1) Hiring first priority, 2) Design partner traction on batch disposition
- December checkpoint: Want clear signal on design partner learnings and 2026 scaling direction

### Next Steps

- Debrief call after Zach interview tomorrow (Quinn available afternoon)
- Pierre case study Monday with intentionally vague prompt to test proactivity
- Continue design partner conversations for batch disposition validation
