## Executive Summary

Ginku is building a patient payments mobile app for clinical trial participants. Mobile payments and travel reimbursement improves the participant experience, increases enrollment/retention for sponsors/CROs, and improves operational efficiency for sites. The patient payments market has an annual revenue potential of $1B+ (5-10% of the overall eClinical market) but is largely untapped. Modern fintech infrastructure enables Ginku to launch a next-generation payments platform during a time when sponsors/CROs continue to invest in tools to engage patients across the funnel from pre-screening to study completion.

Ginku is planning for MVP launch in Q3/Q4-2022 with key features, including instant payment delivery, no patient fees, choosing payment options, and 2-way messaging with patients and sites. Patient payments is a necessary and frequent touchpoint for patients throughout the clinical trial funnel that can serve as a wedge over time into other patient-focused eClinical solutions and site payments.

Sam Whitaker co-founded Greenphire, the largest player in the space that was acquired for $1.1B in 2021 with a subpar product driving a $100M run-rate. Sam, Jason, and Shawn are now leveraging those lessons to bring a superior product to the market with ambitions to go beyond patient payments and build a transformational eClinical company.

Virtue is investing $825K in a $7.5M round at a post-money valuation of $27M (3% ownership) to develop the MVP, build a team (sales, operations, engineering), and generate $5M in bookings.

## Overview: Patient Payments in Clinical Trials

The payment of healthy volunteers and patient-subjects for their participation in clinical research is a longstanding practice that has been documented for well over 100 years and has become an expectation in almost all clinical trials today with >90% of studies paying participants. In the past, patients were paid a train or taxi fare or had their parking expenses covered when traveling to a nearby clinical site. Today, trials are often carried out in specialist centers with patients traveling in from all over the country. As trials become more decentralized and move towards the home, sponsors and sites are also thinking about how to develop creative strategies to pay patients for their time and participation. Patient payments have become more popular over the last few decades with increased funding for biopharma R&D and a greater emphasis from sponsors on greater inclusion of diverse populations in clinical trials.

Healthy participants and volunteers, who mostly are involved with phase I clinical trials to determine if drugs are safe in humans, are paid to incentivize participation. While some clinical trials for late-stage cancer patients that provide access to potentially life-saving cancer drugs may not pay patients, studies for depression, cold sores, asthma, and numerous other conditions pay patients stipends for their time and reimburse for travel expenses.

**Value for patients**: Patient stipends and reimbursement play are top of mind of healthy volunteers and patient-subjects. For healthy volunteers, >90% of those surveyed said financial compensation was their main motivation for participation. Other motives, such as curiosity, altruism, knowledge, etc, are also motivating factors, but financial motivation is far and away the most influential patient motivation. Surveys of all clinical research participants show that receiving monetary compensation is one of the top 2 or 3 reasons to participate in a clinical trial. For cancer trials with the potential for access to life-saving therapies, worries about health insurance coverage of clinical care costs represented one of the strongest barriers to trial enrollment. Lower education and income levels were associated with a decreased willingness to participate in clinical trials (link). These studies and other anecdotes support the notion that financial barriers play an important role in patient decisions to participate in cancer clinical trials, and they highlight the need for efforts to address these barriers to enhance trial recruitment.

**Value for sponsors**: Patient enrollment and retention is one of the biggest challenges for sponsors today, and patient payments can help across the entire participant journey. More than 80% of clinical trials fail to satisfy their enrollment timelines. 30% of patients drop out of clinical trials. More than 1/3 of sites selected for clinical trials under-enroll, and 11% fail to enroll a single subject. On average, it costs ~$6.5K to recruit one patient to a clinical study, and the cost to replace a patient lost due to non-compliance is even higher (~$20K). Patient payments and travel reimbursement can improve enrollment, keep participants engaged throughout the trial, and eliminate the financial hurdles that may prevent them from completing a clinical trial. Delivering participant payments immediately following a milestone or visit and implementing notifications can increase study retention and engagement. Sponsors and CROs want to be viewed by high-performing sites as the partner of choice. Providing patient convenience solutions such as reimbursement and travel reimbursement/support were some of the top methods of how sponsors/CROs can foster enhanced relationships with sites.

**Value for sites**: Clinical research sites increase profitability by enrolling more patients in with efficient operations and processes. Reducing the burden of administrative tasks gives sites the ability to focus on their research and patients. By reducing time spent on cumbersome patient payment processes and reducing errors, patient payment solutions can create a more efficient trial. Currently, most sites are left to figure out patient payments and reimbursement on their own. 76% of sites book travel for their patients, and 81% say quality transportation is important for recruitment and retention purposes. Patient payments and reimbursement solutions can help alleviate this top hurdle for sites. As described in TAM section below, 30% of patient payments today are made directly from sponsors/CROs to patients while 70% of patients receive payments from sites.

## Why now?

**Fintech infrastructure**: Greenphire, the leader in the patient payments space today, was founded in 2008. Over the last 14 years, advancements in fintech infrastructure have greatly improved the performance and reduced the cost of building a payments solution. Integrated infrastructure reduces years of engineering build and maintenance into a single API. Whereas companies of the past often needed to spend millions of dollars of venture funding and years of precious startup time just getting their product to the market, that money and focus can now be turned towards financial product innovation.

## Impact of COVID-19 on Clinical Trials

When the Covid-19 pandemic first hit in March 2020, it led to an immediate boom in Covid-19 clinical trials. Progress in other therapeutic areas stalled: sponsors suspended enrollment, initiation dates pushed back, and many trials terminated. Patients who previously deferred their periodic check-ups, as well as sponsors that delayed trial initiations, are now coming back to clinics – which allows for clinical trial activity to start recuperating. There are still lingering obstacles, such as staff shortages and delays in funding and regulatory reviews, especially affecting certain disease areas.

## Market

Ginku is focused initially on the patient payments and travel reimbursement market with plans to expand to broader eClinical solutions over time. To estimate the size of the patient payments market, we performed a TAM analysis based on trial characteristics by phase to reach a **TAM of $1.2B (in annual revenues)**.

*   **Patients per trial**: Assuming $25/patient/month with participant size increasing from 75 in Ph I to 800 in Ph III
*   **Sites**: $30/site/month with each site enrolling 10 patients
*   **Months**: 18 months for Ph I vs. 30 months for Ph III
*   **Pay / patient**: Patients are paid every other month
*   **Trials per year**: Industry sponsored trials by phase

Of this $1.2B TAM, ~70% of patient payments are directly from sites to patients. Greenphire, Ginku, and other competitors play in the direct sponsor/CRO to patient payments space, which is only 30% of the total TAM today. Of this $378M in sponsor/CEO to patient spend, 65-70% is un-penetrated today, with Greenphire owning ~70% of the penetrated market.

## Product Experience

The team is planning on a Q3/Q4 2022 MVP launch for its mobile patient payments app. The typical workflow will be to provide the patient his first payment and access to the application after the screening visit. In the fully digital environment, Ginku will give the patient access prior to the screening visit in order to help them manage expense associated with going to the first visit. For the MVP, the must-have features include:

*   **Instant payment delivery**: Patients no longer have to wait days or weeks for payments, but can received stipends and reimbursements with the same speed they use Venmo or other consumer apps
*   **Multiple payment choices**: Patients can choose from a variety of payment options that work for them (check, direct to debit, paypal, venmo, etc) vs. being forced to use inconvenient options.
*   **No fees to patients**: Other cards or payment options charge transaction fees or "monthly maintenance” fees. Ginku's goal is to never charge fees to patients.
*   **Messaging**: The team will aim for 2-way messaging in the MVP between the patient and site, but at the very least will enable 1-way messaging to allow the site to communicate with the patient.
*   **Ride Sharing**: Patients will be able to call a car through Uber/Lyft without having to pay for it.
*   **System / architecture features**: Features that enable an externalized API for tech partners, data encryption at rest, data security, etc will also be prioritized early to prepare the company for scale.

**Setup manager GUI**: The set-up manager GUI will help unlock CRO's as a sales channel, a product that hasn't been built before in patient payments. The user at the CRO will be the project management team assigned to the study. The GUI will give the CRO the power to setup and launch a patient payment program on their own, which gives them the opportunity to then generate revenue from the setup process. All of the features specific to the CRO will be the same as the features needed by the internal operations team to quickly and easily setup a new program.

**Other eClinical integration**: Ginku can utilize patient payments as an important wedge into the broader eClinical market, particularly for other patient-facing applications and site payments. With Ginku's mobile app interface, patients will already be logging on to the app on their mobile phones to receive payment, creating additional opportunities for revenue capture and engagement. Over time, Ginku will leverage its patient base and engagement within the app to prioritize different eClinical solutions based on time/resources required, overall opportunity size, competitive dynamics, and required GTM approach. The eClinical market has a wide variety of players, from point solutions to platform companies, across different pieces of the biopharma value chain (see market map below).

The document contains a "Large, Multi-Segment Industry Leaders" eClinical market map, categorized by: Trial/Protocol Design, End-to-End eClinical Solutions, Hybrid Trials, RTSM/IWRS/IRT, EDC, ePRO, eCOA, and/or eSource, Patient / Site Recruitment, Patient Engagement, Risk-Based Monitoring, Clinical Analytics, CTMS/Trial Admin, Safety/Pharmacovigilance, Compliance, eTMF, Regulatory, and/or Quality, Interoperability / Connectivity, and Other. Various companies are listed under each category (e.g., Cytel, Medidata, Greenphire, Veeva).

In a typical study today, for example, one patient may use different apps, websites, or systems for wearables, reminders, eConsent, e-Diary, and payment. Seamless integration and a single, unified user experience can make participation as easy as possible without overburdening the patient. Ginku can integrate with eClinical solutions across the patient journey (eCOA, eConsent, recruitment) and payments infrastructure at sites.

*   **Electronic Clinical Outcomes Assessment (eCOA)**: eCOA is used in conjunction with quantitative clinical data to determine a patient's experience with a disease and treatment more accurately. Measures used with eCOA are often in the form of questionnaires (e.g., rating of pain intensity, occurrence, and severity of migraines). Today, eCOA is a critical component of clinical studies given the importance of collecting high-quality data and represents a strategic fit with payments to drive compliance.
*   **eConsent**: eConsent is a digital consent process that potential study participants undergo prior to enrollment as well as throughout the study to confirm their comprehension. Studies show that studies using eConsent can enroll 25% fewer patients to reach the same completion goals compared to paper-based studies given the reduced dropout rates. Patients who better understand the clinical trial process are more likely to complete it.
*   **Recruitment**: As mentioned above, patient recruitment is a major cost driver and inefficiency for sponsors and CROs today. Clinical trial recruitment companies are paid $5K (cardiovascular) -$20K (rare disease/neuro) per patient recruited.

## GTM

**Sponsors**: Ginku will sell into the clinical operations group at sponsors with a direct sales force targeting 8-12 contracts per year. The clinical operations group makes decisions about patient payments and travel reimbursement during the trial protocol design prior to the first patient visit of the study. Based on Sam's experience with Greenphire, Ginku is expecting a total contract value (TCV) of $100K-$150K depending on the size of the trial, the number of sites, and number of payments. TCV is based on per patient pricing ($25), per site ($30), per payment ($2), and a setup fee for the trial. The typical contract for a sponsor is 30 months. If a sponsor wants to enter into a strategic partnership where they commit a certain number of studies per year and Ginku can negotiate out a discount for increased volume across the enterprise. Ginku's pricing structure is lower risk for sponsors and aligned with a pay-for-use model that is not typical of eClinical players today. Ginku will not front-load costs in the form of large setup fees like Greenphire and other competitors in the space.

**Sites**: Sponsor sales will be the focus for Ginku in terms of overall strategy and allocation of resources, but site sales in tandem with sponsor sales will help empower sites to improve the patient experience. Site contracts are only $15K over longer contract periods as a way to ensure sites have “skin-in-the-game”. For reference, the TCV for sites is only $15K and the sponsor to site salesperson ratio will likely remains closer to a 4:1 throughout the next 2-3 years.

**CROs**: Pharmaceutical R&D spend continues to increase and an increasing percentage of this spend is outsourced to CROs. Players across the space are looking to M&A and differentiated services/technology to compete win new market share and expand within their current customer base in a rapidly evolving market with increasing complexity and cost. Patient payment solutions have not been sold to CROs to-date, but the increasing adoption of digital tools across CROs and competitive market dynamics can drive adoption of Ginku's patient friendly mobile app. CROs would want to do the setup work, charge sponsors for the additional service, and utilize Ginku to improve enrollment and retention.

## Competition

The competitive landscape is made up of patient payments point solutions, other eClinical tools that integrate patient payments, and other platform companies that could theoretically utilize their site and patient interactions to develop a patient payments solution in the future.

*   **Greenphire**: The company provides a pre-paid debit card for clinical trial participants. Founded in 2008, the company was acquired by Thoma Bravo in 2021 for $1.1B. In 2021, the company was expecting a ~$100M revenue run-rate, with 70-80% majority of that revenue from its patient payment and travel reimbursement solutions. Sam is intimately familiar with Greenphire's product roadmap and Thoma Bravo's typical strategy to drive revenue and cut R&D costs gives us confidence Greenphire will struggle to improve on its current product.
*   **BBK, Acurian, Realtime**: CTMS platforms and recruitment companies also offer patient payments solutions given their touchpoints with sites and patients. Almost all of these products are outsourced, service heavy, and rely on third party prepaid debit cards.

*   **Veeva / Medidata / Medable**: Large clinical trial companies could theoretically build patient payments solutions, but given conversations to-date these players would likely rather partner with a company like Ginku that provides an easy-to-use API. When comparing Ginku and these large players, patient payments is in the “goldilocks zone”. Patient payments is a large enough market today to build a big business, but specific enough that large players won't invest the time and resources to build an integrated payment experience.

## Financials

Ginku's plan is to reach $5M in bookings with 50% gross margins by the end of 2023 (~55 sponsor contracts, ~35 site contracts).

*   **Revenue breakdown**: Based on Sam's Greenphire experience, the company is conservatively projecting a TCV of $110K. In the patient payments space alone, there are potential expansion opportunities within sponsors across different trials and with CROs on enterprise contracts. Ginku is looking to sign 2-3 year contracts with sponsors and 5 year contracts with sites.
*   **COGS**: Fintech system partner fees/expenses and AWS and other technology expenses make up the company's COGS. In the first year, gross margins are expected to be closer to 50% but over time the company can scale to 80+% gross margins as it grows revenue.
*   **Sales efficiency**: A fully-ramped up sponsor salesperson will be able to close 1 sponsor contract per month (TCV of $110K bookings). 10-12 sponsor contracts per salesperson per year generating $1M+ in contract bookings can provide an efficient path to scale.
*   **OpEx**: Payroll is expected to be 75-85% of OpEx, which is typical for a company at Ginku's stage. The company wants to bring on ~10 team members across the rest of 2022 across sales, engineering, marketing, and operations.

Assuming a $825K investment from Virtue in Ginku's seed round and reserves of $1M for a Series A, Virtue can maintain a 2.5-3% ownership throughout the subsequent 2-3 financings. Exit scenarios range from a niche point solution, Greenphire 2.0, to an integrated patient-focused eClinical platform.

## Areas of strength / key risk

### Areas of strength
*   **Founder-market fit**: Sam co-founded Greenphire 14 years ago and is able to combine his lessons from Greenphire with Jason's finance and pharma industry knowledge. As a product-focused CEO, Sam is intimately aware of the intricacies of the participant experience and how to create 10x better product experience for participants, sites, and sponsors. Sam is leveraging a tried and true business model and GTM strategy from Greenphire and building on that with novel pricing (e.g., reduction in upfront fees) and GTM (e.g., CRO sales) strategies.
*   **High gross-margin business**: At scale, Ginku's patient payments solution is an 80+% gross-margin business selling into pharma customers with multi-year contracts and reasonable sales cycle (90-120 days). Additional eClinical integrations and future product developments may incorporate more professional services to scale top-line revenue (e.g., recruitment) but Ginku should be able to maintain these margins over time.
*   **Patient payments as wedge**: Greenphire showed that patient payments alone can build a nice business, but Sam and team have ambitions to leverage this superior product experience around patient payments to expand into other eClinical areas. The eClinical market ($15-$20B) is large and growing, but notoriously lacking patient-focused solutions with 10x product experiences

### Key risks / mitigation strategies

*   **Patient payments market size**: The patient payments market represents a $1B annual revenue potential at scale and Greenphire demonstrated the ability to build a large business in the space, but the market is still relatively under-penetrated today (e.g., 70% of payment is direct site to sponsor). Ginku is well-positioned to capture share from current players, increase penetration within the current patient payments market, and expand to other patient-facing eClinical solutions (eCOA, patient recruitment) and site-payments.
*   **Competition**: While Greenphire could replace their pre-paid debit card with a mobile-first payment experience, Sam's knowledge of the product roadmap at Greenphire and Thoma Bravo's strategy to reduce R&D costs give us confidence Greenphire will fail to innovate on the product side. A number of other players in the eClinical space (Medidata, Veeva, Science 37) could theoretically build a patient payments solutions and layer it on top of their patient, site, and sponsor/CRO relationships. In speaking to individuals at these companies, we have confidence that these large players would rather utilize an API from a player like Ginku rather than build a patient payments solution themselves.
