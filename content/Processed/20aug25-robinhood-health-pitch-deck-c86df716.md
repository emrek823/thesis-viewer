## Slide 2: Value-Based Care Is Failing Medicaid Patients.

Despite promises of improved outcomes, value-based care models have created a troubling two-tier healthcare system. Medicaid patients consistently receive lower quality care across critical health metrics:

**Chart: Comparison of Quality Care Metrics (Commercial vs. Medicaid)**

| Metric                    | Commercial | Medicaid |
| :------------------------ | :--------- | :------- |
| Colorectal Cancer Screening | 56%        | 39%      |
| Diabetes Control (HbA1c <8%) | 71%        | 52%      |
| Kidney Health Evaluation  | 38%        | 29%      |
| *Overall Gap*             | 44%        | 37%      |
| *Overall Gap*             | 30%        |          |

**Note:** The chart presents three pairs of bars for Commercial (pink) and Medicaid (blue) for each metric. The percentages 44%, 71%, 56%, 39%, 37%, 30%, 52%, 38%, 29% are read directly from the bars. The "Overall Gap" percentages (44%, 37%, 30%) appear above the chart, likely representing the difference between commercial and Medicaid outcomes for the respective metrics, but are placed in a way that makes direct correlation to a specific metric ambiguous without further context. Based on typical bar chart representation, the percentages above the bars usually indicate the *value* of the bar itself. I will list them as they appear in context.

The numbers next to the bars are:
*   Colorectal Cancer Screening: Commercial 56%, Medicaid 39%. Above these bars, 44% is shown.
*   Diabetes Control (HbA1c <8%): Commercial 71%, Medicaid 52%. Above these bars, 37% is shown.
*   Kidney Health Evaluation: Commercial 38%, Medicaid 29%. Above these bars, 30% is shown.

For clarity in a markdown table, I'll represent the direct percentages from the bars. The 44%, 37%, 30% percentages are positioned above sets of bars, suggesting a gap or broader metric, but without explicit labels connecting them to specific gaps, it's best to transcribe the direct bar values.

| Metric                        | Commercial (%) | Medicaid (%) |
| :---------------------------- | :------------- | :----------- |
| Colorectal Cancer Screening₁  | 56             | 39           |
| Diabetes Control (HbA1c <8%)₂ | 71             | 52           |
| Kidney Health Evaluation₃     | 38             | 29           |

*Additional percentages shown above the groups of bars:* 44%, 37%, 30%. Their exact association (e.g., total gap for a group) is not explicitly labeled on the graph itself but usually refers to the percentage of patients receiving care. Given the context, the 44% for Colorectal Cancer Screening represents the total not screened (100-56=44), the 37% for Diabetes Control (100-71=29, this doesn't directly map) and 30% for Kidney Health (100-38=62, this also doesn't directly map). It's possible these represent the *percentage of patients receiving care*, and the larger numbers above are total market or overall compliance targets. Based on the slide's main point, it's more likely these are *failure* rates. Let's re-interpret from the overall message "Value-Based Care Is Failing Medicaid Patients" and "Medicaid patients consistently receive lower quality care across critical health metrics". If 56% get screened, 44% do not. If 71% get diabetes control, 29% do not. If 38% get kidney evaluation, 62% do not. This interpretation doesn't match the 37% and 30% numbers.

A more direct interpretation for the numbers above the bars would be that they represent the *percentage not receiving care* for the Commercial group (100-56=44), and 100-71=29 (not 37), 100-38=62 (not 30).
Let's assume the numbers on the bars (56%, 39%, etc.) are *completion* rates, and the numbers *above* the groups (44%, 37%, 30%) are overall *gaps* or other metrics. The context makes this ambiguous. I will only transcribe what is directly on or clearly associated with the bars as percentages of *patients receiving care* for Commercial and Medicaid, as this is the most direct reading. The numbers (44%, 71%, 56%, 39%, 37%, 30%, 52%, 38%, 29%) are the percentages of people *receiving care*. The numbers above the sets of bars (44%, 37%, 30%) are likely industry benchmarks or overall failure rates for that category. Given no explicit label, I'll transcribe them as they are positioned.

| Metric                        | Commercial (%) | Medicaid (%) | Overall Gap (%) |
| :---------------------------- | :------------- | :----------- | :-------------- |
| Colorectal Cancer Screening₁  | 56             | 39           | 44              |
| Diabetes Control (HbA1c <8%)₂ | 71             | 52           | 37              |
| Kidney Health Evaluation₃     | 38             | 29           | 30              |

## Slide 10: 47-59% Cost Reduction vs. Current MCO Spending

Our solution delivers substantial cost savings to Managed Care Organizations while improving quality metrics:

*   **48% savings** on colorectal cancer screening, a critical HEDIS measure.
*   **47% savings** on diabetes monitoring, directly impacting care gap closure rates.
*   **59% savings** on kidney function tests, essential for high-risk member monitoring.

These dramatic cost reductions, combined with our higher completion rates, create a compelling value proposition for MCO partners.

**Chart: Cost Comparison (MCO Current Cost vs. Our Pricing)**

| Test                            | MCO Current Cost | Our Pricing | Savings (%) |
| :------------------------------ | :--------------- | :---------- | :---------- |
| Colorectal Cancer Screening     | $182             | $95         | 48%         |
| Diabetes Monitoring (HbA1c)     | $142             | $75         | 47%         |
| Kidney Function Tests           | $282             | $115        | 59%         |

## Slide 11: Scale Economics for Each 3k kits (70% return rate)

**700 of each kit returned**
(FIT: 700 x $95, HbA1c: 700 x $75, Kidney: 700 x $115)

**Waterfall Chart Data Breakdown:**

| Category          | Value (k$) | Description/Cost per test |
| :---------------- | :--------- | :------------------------ |
| Total Revenue     | $199k      |                           |
| Operations        | ($3.6k)    | $1.70/test                |
| Clinical Team     | ($14.2k)   | $6.75/test                |
| Non-Clinical Team | ($16.5k)   | $7.83/test                |
| Executive Team    | ($13.5k)   | $6.43/test (includes providers) |
| Kit Cost          | ($74k)     |                           |
| **Gross Profit**  | **$77.8k** |                           |

*Note:* "Reduce kit cost by 40% over time, increased our Contribution Margin to **54% from 39%**"
The $29.6k appears twice on the right side of the chart, associated with the "Kit Cost" reduction, implying a calculated value after reduction, leading to the gross profit. The $74k is the initial kit cost. The $29.6k might represent the *reduction* in kit cost, or the *new* kit cost after a 40% reduction, but context suggests $74k is the initial cost, and the remaining green bar shows gross profit. The text says "Reduce kit cost by 40%...". If $74k is the cost, a 40% reduction would be $29.6k (74 * 0.4 = 29.6), meaning the new kit cost would be $74k - $29.6k = $44.4k. The waterfall chart visually depicts the total revenue ($199k) then subtracts various costs, leaving a final Gross Profit. The $29.6k is shown as a component, but the final Kit Cost shown on the graph is $74k before the Gross Profit. The arrow points from $107.4k (Cumulative after Executive Team) to a segment that is $29.6k, which leads to $77.8k (Gross Profit). This implies a reduction in Kit Cost is factored in, making the actual kit cost used in calculation different from $74k. The $74k is visually shown as the 'Kit Cost' bar but it's probably the initial one. The $29.6k bar and $77.8k are the final calculated profit.
To resolve this, I will list the direct numbers on the bars for the waterfall.
The bars are:
Total Revenue: $199k
Operations: $3.6k (deduction)
Clinical Team: $14.2k (deduction)
Non-Clinical Team: $16.5k (deduction)
Executive Team: $13.5k (deduction)
Kit Cost: $74k (deduction)
Gross Profit: $77.8k

This implies that the $29.6k is not a direct step in this specific calculation shown, but related to the "Reduce kit cost by 40%... Contribution Margin to 54% from 39%". The $107.4k is a running total before the last two deductions.
The waterfall graph visually progresses:
1.  Total Revenue: $199k
2.  After Operations: $199k - $3.6k = $195.4k (implied)
3.  After Clinical Team: $195.4k - $14.2k = $181.2k (implied)
4.  After Non-Clinical Team: $181.2k - $16.5k = $164.7k (implied)
5.  After Executive Team: $164.7k - $13.5k = $151.2k (implied)
The bar for Kit Cost visually extends from $151.2k down to $77.2k (approx $151.2k - $74k = $77.2k).
The final gross profit bar is $77.8k. This implies a slight discrepancy or different flow logic for the $29.6k part.
The diagram explicitly shows $74k as 'Kit Cost' and $77.8k as 'Gross Profit'.
I will stick to the listed costs and the stated gross profit.

**Cost Breakdown per test (from footnotes):**
1.  Operations: $1.70/test
2.  Clinical Team: $6.75/test
3.  Non-Clinical Team: $7.83/test
4.  Executive Team: $6.43/test (includes providers)
