## Slide 6: The real problem

Confidential and Privileged

**The real problem**

“It is impossible to understand addiction without asking what relief the addict finds, or hopes to find, in the drug or the addictive behaviour.

The question is not why the addiction, but why the pain."
**Dr. Gabor Mate, MD**

“What if depression is, in fact, a form of grief—for our own lives not being as they should? What if it is a form of grief for the connections we have lost, yet still need?

You aren't a machine with broken parts. You are an animal whose needs are not being met.”
**Johann Hari, Lost Connections**

## Slide 7: Hero Journey Club

**Hero Journey Club**

**Wizard's Creed - HERO JOURNEY CLUB**
**Wizard Journeying Style**
The curiosity of the Wizard sharpens their ability to examine thoughts without "buying in" to them. They find themselves saying one thing, then another that is the complete opposite, without worrying about the inconsistency.

**Wizards Strive to:**
*   Develop an appreciation for the inescapable influence of the words they use on themselves and on others
*   Resist the temptation to bring all of experience under the control of thought and language
*   Find ways to bring talk into aware-ness without allowing it to dominate their sense of what is real, right, and wrong

"The enemy of magic is thinking. The more powerful the thought, the weaker the magic."
Timm the Empty

**Class Skills - HERO JOURNEY CLUB**
*   **Skill 1 - Mental Barrier**

    *My Focus: Shade your progress:* (Image of progress bar with 6 filled dots)
*   **Skill 6 - Enter Dreamscape**

    The Final Feat of the Wizard is to betaught by dreams. How dreams are made is more important than what they mean they show us that thoughts 'happen' instead of caused.

**Monk - HERO JOURNEY CLUB**
**Introduction**
The Monks of Hero's Hall study the art of 'sitting in fire' and being taught at the feet of their feelings. They are no strangers to discomfort and may often come from a difficult and challenging past. They first 'seek the fire' through learning about their emotions and then gradually practice giving themselves over to their instruction. They become the wisest of us as a result of their art, self-compassion, and patience. They learn a profound truth that fire burns colder the longer they sit with it.
"Feelings can't be ignored, no matter how unjust or ungrateful they seem"
Anne Frank, Monk of Captivity

**Monk's Creed - HERO JOURNEY CLUB**
**Monk Journeying Style**
Monks are rarely in a hurry. Emotions unfold slowly, especially into awareness, and also depart slowly. Monks have learned to adapt their sense of urgency to this unavoidable internal dynamic.

**Monks Strive to:**
*   Remember that although over-whelming at times, fully feeling their emotions will serve them better than pushing them down or avoiding them.
*   Simply talking about feelings, what led up to them, and what they feel like is often the most effective way to begin.
*   The more concrete and specific the description in session, the more evoca-tive the feelings will be, and the more healing they enjoy.

"Only by observation and practice do we learn that self-mastery is no mastery at all."
Ordos the Wise

**Class Skills - HERO JOURNEY CLUB**
*   **Skill 1 - Inner Eye**
    Expanding Emotional Awareness
    In this skill you will learn how to tease emotions apart to address them with greater success.
    *My Focus: Shade your progress:* (Image of progress bar with 1 filled dot)
*   **Skill 2 - Judging the Strats**
    Uncover Emotions from Actions
    Increase awareness of your emotions by examining what leads up to them and how you react in key moments.
    *My Focus: Shade your progress:* (Image of progress bar with 2 filled dots)
*   **Skill 3 - Battle Fortitude**
    Emotional Tolerance and Validation
    Staying in the present moment with your feelings is a difficult but critical skill that will benefit you over and over again.
    *My Focus: Shade your progress:* (Image of progress bar with 3 filled dots)
*   **Skill 4 - Pulling Aggro**
    Choosing to Take On Some Heat
    There are likely situations you have been avoiding. In this skill, you will slowly start seeking them out.
    *My Focus: Shade your progress:* (Image of progress bar with 4 filled dots)
*   **Skill 5 - Spotting Emotional Tripwires**
    The Wisdom to Know the Difference
    Not every source of distress should be handled with emotion regulation skills. Learning when you can and should change the situation, and when you can't, will build your wisdom and health.

**Journeyer Love**
**We're more than just mental health support, we're a place to belong.**

"I've been here for a while and I've really enjoyed everything you're doing here. It's helped more than any 1x1 therapy I've tried so far honestly. I've just been trying to get my depression under control. I struggle a lot, but I find myself looking forward to these sessions every week."

I've been an active member of HJC since I first joined the public Discord in February 11th, 2022. I was curious to see if it was actually good or not, and was surprised to see it was filled with genuine, hardworking people who cared tremendously about the well-being of others, regardless if you were a paying member. I'm 17 years old, kind of in the beginning of my "coming of age" stage and currently trying to not let C-PTSD control my life anymore. These people have been the best support I've ever had. They've held hundreds of clinical journey groups as well as dozens of fun public community quests/events, so just so it's out there, these people really do care. (And they're also very professional.)

Not only have I gotten great advice, helpful resources, and valuable mental health information, I definitely feel like I'm a stronger, more stable individual since joining. I'm incredibly grateful that I get to be a part of HJC. :-) To those struggling mentally, emotionally, or socially, maybe give HJC a shot. The community is absolutely wonderful and welcoming. We're pretty chill.

HJC has honestly been life changing for me. I'd never found a therapist I've connected with so well before and I've never had the experience of a therapeutic community like this one before. I've felt significantly better since starting sessions with them and can actually feel some of my less than beneficial habits finally loosening their grip. Honestly couldn't recommend the fantastic humans who run HJC more!

**Ainsley Stevielle**
I absolutely love Hero Journey Club! I have my second session today, but even just being in the discord server is so so helpful. Everyone works really hard to make it a welcoming space and as someone who tends to lurk in servers, I've actually had a lot of good interactions there and I tend to put myself out there more! I highly recommend them to anyone considering it

This is literally one of the best ideas that have surfaced recently. Players can feel engaged in an activity they find comforting while also taking steps to improve mental health and coping mechanisms. I love this.

I've been doing therapy with Hero Journey Club for a couple months now. The therapists are amazing and the people in my group super cool. I'd put off looking into therapy for ages because of my social anxiety but I figured this was something I could handle. I'm so happy I did. If you're thinking about it I definitely recommend giving them a shot. It's honestly helping me a lot and it's lot more affordable than most other therapy options

**lofisigh Genius.** This is great for all the people out there who can't open up to a therapist but will vent and overshare to random strangers they game with on the Internet
