### Business Restructuring & Current Status

- Retrenched after failed Series A and didn’t get credit for service contracts
	- Jettisoned entire services business (picked up by partners)
	- Laid off most of the company - “sucked but came out the other side”
- Current runway through October with new low cost basis
	- Quality measures pipeline should sustain operations
	- Core business theory unchanged - believes in compounding growth
- Goal: achieve run-rate profitability in 2025

### Marketplace Strategy & Product Evolution

- Major architecture change from monolithic Tuva package to modular approach:
- App store model with both Tuva-developed and third-party paid products
- Launch timeline: February-March 2025 (delayed due to stakeholder engagement needs)
- All discovery funneled through marketplace to drive paid product visibility

	- Knowledge: educational content (e.g., calculating ED visits in claims data)
	- Tools: highlighting new marketplace products like CodeRX
	- Jobs: career opportunities for healthcare data analysts
- Over 100 organizations using open source currently - expect to double in 2025
