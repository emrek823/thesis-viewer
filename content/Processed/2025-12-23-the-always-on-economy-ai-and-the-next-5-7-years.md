# The Always-On Economy: AI’s Real Impact in the Next 5-7 Years

Before we get to full-blown AGI, hybrid agent/human systems will remove temporal friction from the economy and create new opportunities.

While discussions about artificial intelligence often oscillate between immediate applications and far-future scenarios of artificial general intelligence (AGI), there’s a crucial middle ground that deserves our attention. In the next 5-7 years, AI will reshape and accelerate our economy by enabling “always-on” operations across numerous sectors. This transformation isn’t merely theoretical—it’s already happening in some industries, offering a preview of our near future.

## The present: Islands of always-on

The future is indeed already here, just unevenly distributed. Several sectors have already achieved “always-on” status through AI:

**Financial markets** exemplify this transformation as early adopters of AI way before the LLM era. What once required physical traders shouting in pits during limited hours has evolved into a 24/7 digital marketplace. This was the result of thousands of brilliant quants creating predictive algorithms to determine when to buy or sell—collectively known now as electronic market makers (e.g. Citadel Securities). The result is a smooth, convenient experience for consumers with better prices. Modern consumers can now execute trades at midnight on a Friday—an impossibility just a few years ago.

**Healthcare** has seen similar evolution. Companies like Viz.ai have revolutionized stroke detection, providing expert-level analysis around the clock in 40% of U.S. hospitals. Before such innovations, if a patient came in at an off hour they wouldn’t be guaranteed the highest quality diagnostic treatment. Now, with AI imaging always on, a LVO (large vessel occlusion) stroke can be detected any day or time. This technology is particularly vital for rural facilities lacking 24/7 specialist coverage, demonstrating how AI can democratize access to expertise. AI-powered devices now constantly track vital signs, creating an “always-on” healthcare presence that was previously impossible. These systems continuously monitor patients’ conditions remotely, immediately alerting providers to concerning changes and enabling data-driven decisions based on real-time information rather than periodic check-ins. The technology extends from hospital settings to patients’ homes with companies like Commure, which offer devices that can perform sophisticated diagnostics (like blood cell counts) through simple procedures such as finger-pricks.

**Physical security** has been transformed by AI into systems of perpetual vigilance. Previously, only high-value facilities had human-monitored camera systems. Today, AI-powered surveillance systems like Verkada use continuous computer vision to monitor countless cameras simultaneously, triggering notifications only when necessary and providing advanced pattern recognition beyond human capabilities. Similarly in law enforcement, police departments now use always-on AI platforms like Peregrine that function as tireless analysts. These systems unify disconnected data across agencies into actionable intelligence, continuously identifying connections between cases and monitoring threats in real-time. This capability was demonstrated at Super Bowl LIX in New Orleans, where the technology provided constant threat monitoring.

## The near future: Expanding always-on operations

The next half-decade will see this always-on capability extend to numerous other sectors:

The days of “high call volume” messages and limited business hours are numbered. AI will handle front-line support continuously, with human managers available for escalations. Small businesses will compete with large corporations in providing 24/7 customer care, using AI to filter and escalate only truly urgent matters.

Rather than waiting for general-purpose robots, specialized systems will enable 24/7 operations in specific domains. For instance, automated food preparation systems will allow restaurants to operate continuously, maintaining consistent quality regardless of time or staffing constraints. AI-powered systems will enable autonomous manufacturing as robots work alongside human operators to maintain continuous production cycles. This will transform manufacturing by optimizing production flow and improving overall efficiency while maintaining the critical human judgment and creativity that drives innovation. Cobot exemplifies this type of future, and is already live in production in logistics and manufacturing operations to redefine human-robot collaboration.

Medical professionals will benefit from AI-powered documentation systems that operate continuously. Consider emergency surgeons responding to 3 AM calls—AI will automatically document these urgent communications, allowing doctors to focus entirely on patient care and superior outcomes rather than administrative tasks. AI note-takers like Freed and Abridge are transforming healthcare by eliminating documentation burdens. And always-on information systems like OpenEvidence help doctors keep up with the latest treatments instantaneously.

ChatGPT already provides students with a 24/7 tutor (that can also do their homework!) and education is primed to become one of the largest use cases for generative AI as its reliability improves and schools figure out how to incorporate it into their curricula responsibly. Not only will AI agents adapt to students’ level of understanding and cognitive needs, but as workers retrain to keep up with the changing job market there will be an increased demand for after hours adult education service as well.

Companies like XBOW have pioneered always-on penetration testing for enterprises. AI is forecast to increase the surface area for cyberattacks as criminals get better at writing their own malicious agents, but 24/7 security will rise to stay ahead of the bad guys.

Always-on will also have an impact on recruiting. 24/7 HR agents will allow candidates with jobs and families to interview for positions at 10 pm or on weekends, allowing great candidates who previously couldn’t schedule interviews to apply.

Fleets of autonomous vehicles will become mainstays in many communities, fulfilling Uber’s original mission to “make transportation as reliable as running water.” Unlike other services with capacity fluctuations, autonomous fleets will maintain consistent availability regardless of time. Benefits include eliminated surge pricing, reliable service in underserved areas, more efficient fleet utilization and reduced total vehicle requirements.

## The Broader Implications

This shift toward an always-on economy will have profound effects:

1. **Economic efficiency:** The elimination of traditional business hours will reduce economic friction and increase asset utilization.
2. **Global competition:** Time zones will become less relevant as AI enables continuous operation across borders.
3. **Work patterns:** Traditional 9-to-5 schedules will evolve as systems operate continuously, requiring new approaches to human oversight and intervention.
4. **Resource distribution:** Peak demand periods will flatten as pricing mechanisms encourage off-hours usage.

## The Always On Workforce

The real transformation AI brings in the next 5-7 years isn’t about replacing human intelligence—it’s about removing temporal constraints from our economy. This shift toward continuous operation will create new opportunities while challenging traditional business models and work patterns. Organizations that adapt to this always-on paradigm will find themselves at a significant advantage in an increasingly fluid and accelerated economic landscape.

The key to success will not lie in completely automating human tasks, but in thoughtfully integrating AI systems to enable continuous operations while maintaining human oversight where it matters most. This hybrid approach will define the next phase of economic evolution, creating a more responsive and efficient economy that never sleeps.
