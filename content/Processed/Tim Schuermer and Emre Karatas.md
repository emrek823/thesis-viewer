### Tim’s Background and Fincura Origin Story

- Co-founder/CEO with fintech background from On Deck (early FinTech 1.0 pioneer)
	- Led revenue/strategy through 0-11-100 scale, then decline
	- Experience deploying credit products to SMBs at scale
- Two co-founders (Louie, Richard) based in Montreal with fintech/software security backgrounds
	- Montreal as engineering hub for cost-effective technical talent
- Raised pre-seed 11-12 months ago from vertical SaaS/fintech funds
- Origin: Brother-in-law (dental practice owner) frustrated with trace number matching for EOBs to bank deposits
	- Led to core insight: bank data as source of truth for healthcare payments

### Fincura Product and Strategy

- Financial system for healthcare practices, providers, platforms
- Core thesis: Fintech company building for healthcare (not healthtech building fintech)
- Payment reconciliation product:
	- Real-time matching of insurance claims/remits to bank deposits
	- Auto-ledgering back to ERP/EHR systems
	- Partners with Steady for ERAs, direct payer integrations
	- Payment recon: ton of latency in the way providers currently ledger (5-25 business days vs real-time)
- Value drivers:
	- Gets practices enrolled in EFTs vs checks (100% reconciliation rate with unique trace numbers)
	- Real-time notifications when payments hit accounts
	- Customers trust them as financial activity source
- Strategic positioning: Avoiding red ocean RCM space, letting others commoditize
	- Focus on fintech stack expansion: payments facilitation, accounting/ledgering, spend management
	- Bank data ownership enables novel products (pay-by-bank vs 2.5% card fees)

### Current Traction and Fundraising Plans

- Customer base: Tens of providers across dental, medical, behavioral health, ambulatory groups
- Processing 7-figures monthly payment volume
- Revenue: Healthy 5-figures monthly with accelerating growth curve into Q4
- Fundraising timeline: Likely January 2025 kickoff
- Follow-up planned for one month to continue conversation
