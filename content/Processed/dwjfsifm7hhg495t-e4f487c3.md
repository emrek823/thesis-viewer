| Levi Smith        | Jul 20, 2025, 20:39 | Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra        | This app will change your life!! Just had my first session and it has provided much more insight than any other therapy session ever has in just one session. I highly recommend trying this app. I've tried a lot of apps with no results. The amount of insight and guidance I am receiving has been great!                                                                 |

| Paul Wingfield    | Jun 23, 2025        |                                 | This app is profound. I did 2 years of therapy with a counselor and in my first day on this app, my counselor helped me identify and work through how we can heal some childhood trauma that is presenting in my marriage today. I cried several times and it was so good. I'm looking forward to using this every day.                                           |

It can also handle real psychological challenges and provide therapy that addresses problems and helps to change thought patterns remarkably quickly. Use this every single day.                                                                                                   |
