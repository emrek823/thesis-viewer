## Slide 6: Why PBMs Win with Our PMPM Guarantee

**MavRx**
by WriteWise

**Why PBMs Win with Our PMPM Guarantee**

**The Challenge**
Most PMPM guarantees in the market are synthetic — built on old claims data, inflated with exclusions, and lacking actuarial credibility.

**The WriteWise Solution**
WriteWise enables PBMs to issue real, risk-backed PMPM guarantees:
*   Built on predictive analytics (trend, churn, manual rates, volatility)
*   Modeled at the NDC level, not channel averages
*   Receives underwriting credit of 15% on average on Medical Stop Loss policies
*   Delivered in minutes, not weeks

**Outcome:** Data-backed, future-looking pricing you can confidently stand behind.

**Our core services**

**Core Services Descriptions:**

**Pharmacy Pricing & Analytics**
Go from the Past to the Future. PBM pricing teams use MavRx to normalize conflicting pricing data and generate precise, NDC-level cost projections. This replaces retrospective assumptions with forward-looking PMPM forecasts that improve pricing accuracy. The result is stronger savings validation, stop loss underwriting credit, and new margin opportunities through shared savings strategies & accurate forecasts.

**Sales & Account Teams**
Sales and account management teams use MavRx to deliver clear, data-backed pharmacy pricing and performance insights to brokers and plan sponsors. The platform simplifies PBM comparisons and accelerates RFP responses with exportable reports and predictive cost modeling. This builds trust, shortens deal cycles, and supports long-term client retention through transparency and measurable outcomes.

**Workflow Automation**
MavRx uses automation to streamline data ingestion, normalize pricing files, and standardize PBM comparisons in real time. This eliminates manual spreadsheet work and reduces the risk of errors or inconsistent assumptions. Automated repricing and audit tools accelerate turnaround time for proposals, RFPs, and renewals. For PBMs, this means faster responses, improved accuracy, and the ability to scale competitive, data-driven pricing strategies with minimal lift.
