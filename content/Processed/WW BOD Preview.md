### Financing Overview

- Current runway: 14 months based on actual billings
- HIT and ProCare ARR to billings conversion pending confirmation
- Series A timing considerations:
	- Current market shows 15-20% graduation rate from seed to A
	- Companies raising now getting terms ranging from decent to frothy
	- Could raise $10-12M now with relatively low friction
	- Waiting until Q4 could enable raising $20-30M at similar dilution (around 20%)

### Product Strategy & Positioning

- Core position: Smart layer between PBMs and employers for PBM accountability and captive pharmacy spend
- PMPM Guarantee mechanics:
	- Uses confidence interval approach; narrower intervals enable more competitive pricing
	- Leverages training data and actual group performance predictions
	- PBMs have multiple control levers including definitions of brand drugs, specialty, claims
	- Will not reinsure PBMs below 75th percentile
	- Currently reinsuring at same attachment point as PMPM guarantee

### Platform & Integration

- 10 PBMs now on platform with varying integration levels:
	- Basic: Can underwrite with pricing supplement copy
	- Advanced: Get longitudinal data, evaluate performance
	- Can work with AWP -85% on generics with brand/specialty definition lists
- Zero claims paid for risk taken across all customers
- Current customer base:
	- 4 live PMPM guarantee customers
	- 4-5 live essential optimal customers

### Product Development

- New software functionality:
	- Built sales pipeline software for PBMs/PBCs
	- Currently offering as free tool gateway to fixed cost products
	- AI chatbot for group plans and contract design questions
	- Interface for “what-if” scenario planning

### Pricing & Product Tiers

- PMPM Guarantee/RxProtect: $5 PMPM for 1000 employees
- Essential/Optimal:
	- Optimal is premium version replacing PBM
	- Includes build-a-bear formulary version of PBM
	- HCI partnership example: 2M member potential (significant revenue opportunity)

### Market Expansion Strategy

Two primary approaches:

- Captives and Associations
	- Aggregated books targeting 100k+ members
	- Essential selling through HCI and VWA
	- Commercial truckers (1099) market opportunity
- Enterprise PMPM Guarantee
	- Pricing scales down with size
	- Centivo partnership potential:
		- Mid-market: $5-10 PMPM
		- Enterprise: $0.50-1.00 PMPM
	- Alvarez and Marsal partnership for F50/F100 turnarounds

### Key Customer Examples

- Excel: First PMPM customer
- Health in Tech:
	- Currently 12k members in pipeline
	- Actually has 25-30k members
	- Medical stop loss security depends on pharmacy decrement
	- Level funded health benefits for small groups
