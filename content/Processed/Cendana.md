### First-Time Founder Investment Strategy

- 100% of portfolio founders are first-time founders (3 out of 3)
- Healthcare founder demographics shifting significantly
	- Historically older founders with established networks
	- Now seeing younger founders with stronger technical aptitude
	- Technical product builders outperforming traditional “Rolodex” operators
- Examples of new generation healthcare founders:
	- Michael Gao (SmartDX): Deep revenue cycle/clinical documentation expertise, built products at NYC Presbyterian
	- Jack O’Hara (Translucent): Former CIO/CTO at multibillion-dollar medical groups, understands FP&A functions
- Virtue better positioned for first-time founders vs. established healthcare CEOs
- Traditional healthcare VCs require extensive calls to get comfortable with first-time founders, putting them out of contention

### Healthcare Investment Evolution

- Fund I portfolio shift: 50% care delivery models in first third → 12% in final third
- Moving away from virtual care models (MSK, diabetes, cardiovascular) that dominated 2010s
- Favoring founders from outside healthcare bringing domain expertise:
	- Ex-Uber Freight founder (logistics/integration experience translating to life sciences)
	- Data company alumni building healthcare data networks
- Still require domain expertise, just manifesting differently

### Fund Sizing Strategy Discussion

- Current reserve ratio tracking well in Virtue I, distributed across more companies than intended
- Fund III considerations: targeting $75-100M to reflect changing market conditions
	- Need $3-4M upfront investments to achieve 10%+ ownership
	- Not about increasing reserves, but meeting higher entry prices
	- Current deals receiving “nosebleed” offers requiring competitive positioning
- Trade-off concern: larger fund size may preclude collaborative deals like SmarterDX (3-5% ownership)
	- Counter-argument: stronger brand will secure primary/secondary seats vs. third checks
- Preference for LPs who understand strategy vs. those who reject fund size without context

### Market Competition Challenges

- Key concern: having sufficient capital to compete for top-decile deals
- Building 12-18 month relationships with founders, then facing aggressive pricing from other VCs
- Expecting significant capital loss in current seed market due to inflated valuations
- Maintaining discipline while ensuring ability to “play the game”
- Seed deals trading at prices that represent lowest cost basis ever
