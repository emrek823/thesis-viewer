# Amae Health - External Investment Memo

## Executive Summary

The 14.2M adults in the US today suffering from serious mental illness (SMI) have been underserved for decades, but recent policy changes and early demonstration of clinical outcomes in integrated care models have set the stage for a major shift in how SMI patients are treated in this country. Top academic centers and research institutions have developed effective clinical models in regional pockets, but scaling these models across the country requires a thoughtful approach to tech integration and sophistication with payer contracting models. Managed Care Organizations (MCOs) have been historically focused on carving-out behavioral health benefits for SMI, but are increasingly interested in integrated care models to reduce medical spend for these patients ($20K - $50K per year).

Amae Health can take advantage of market tailwinds, leverage already validated clinical models, and develop a staged-approach to risk-based contracting to become a leader in the fledgling SMI market. The company's GTM strategy, which combines a bottoms-up approach with health systems and top-down approach with MCOs, gives us confidence the company can identify, engage, and retain patients to build a high-growth services business serving a high-cost patient

### SMI Market Overview

In 2020, there were an estimated 14.2 million adults aged 18 or older in the United States with SMI - representing 5.6% of all U.S. adults. Young adults aged 18-25 years had the highest prevalence of SMI (9.7%) compared to adults aged 26-49 years (6.9%) and aged 50 and older (3.4%). The most common SMI disorders are psychotic disorders, bipolar disorder, and either major depression with psychotic symptoms or treatment-resistant depression. Other disorders in this category include anxiety disorders, eating disorders, and personality disorders, if the degree of functional impairment is severe. Although these disorders are heterogeneous based on symptom-based diagnoses based on the DSM-V, the multi-factorial impacts (e.g., support networks, housing, hedonic tone) and optimal clinical approach for each group are remarkably similar. Treatments that are demonstrated to be effective for SMI may include some combination of prescription medications, other supports (e.g., inpatient treatment, respite care, assertive community treatment, coordinated specialty care, supported employment), and psychotherapy. Despite these options, nearly one-third of adults with SMI reported receiving no mental health treatment. Even those patients who do get care are often not receiving adequate care. Nearly a third of adults with SMI who receive medications only, with no psychosocial or psychotherapeutic services.

Estimates for total direct costs for patients with SMI range from $200B - $300B (link, link), which includes total spending on behavioral and medical services. On an PMPY basis, the average SMI patient spend ranges from $15K - $20K, with a subset (~5%) of individuals with PMPY costs up to $50K. Individuals with SMI cost 2X-5X more than their counterparts without an SMI diagnosis. A majority of these increased costs can be attributed to medical services. For commercial and Medicaid plans, ~70% of the costs for treating individuals with SMI are from medical services or prescriptions, while only 30% are attributed to behavioral. For non-elderly adults with SMI, ~50% of patients have commercial insurance and ~25% are enrolled in medicaid. Medicaid has been a leader in managed care broadly, with >70% of spending under managed care contracts.

### Macro trends

**Policy Changes:** Beginning in the late 80s/early 90s, a long-standing policy effort effectively shifted state mental health expenditures from custodial care (state agency payrolls) to community support. The notable side effect of this shift was that states moved from a budget category that increased predictably (collective

## Page 5

bargaining, direct state responsibility, etc.) to a budget line item not indexed to inflation. As a result, the collective percentage of state budgets allocated to mental health began to fall. Furthermore, states often financed community care with Medicaid dollars; Medicaid has historically had numerous challenges (horizontal carve outs misaligning behavioral and medical care, poor fit between eligibility and clinical need, cumbersome billing processes, etc.). Treating SMI under a fee-for-service (FFS) per encounter will likely never be attractive as it represents an unprofitable model — treating and financing SMI has to be in a value-based care (VBC) model.

Recent policy developments have set the stage for a dramatic change in how behavioral benefits are administered. In 2016, CMS issued its managed care mental health parity final rule (81 FR 18389), which clarified and aligned rules in Medicaid with the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 (MHPAEA). Although the MHPAEA law became effective in October 2009, regulations covering its implementation in Medicaid were not finalized until CMS released the final parity rule in 2016. The second rule of importance was CMS's 2016 Medicaid and CHIP managed care final rule (85 FR 72754), which enhanced the role of care coordination and other supports to ensure the smooth transition of care.

These two policy changes supported the move towards integrated behavioral and medical care. The interest in financial integration of behavioral health represents a shift from horizontal carve-out arrangements that have been common in Medicaid going back to the 1990s. Carve-out arrangements have increasingly been perceived as a barrier to better clinical outcomes and cost reductions for Medicaid enrollees, particularly those with SMI. The belief that clinically integrated care may be incompatible with separate financing of mental and physical health services is partially responsible for a shift to carving in behavioral health services. This shift has accelerated rapidly from 2016 to today. 31 states had vertical integrated behavioral health financing arrangements in 2020, nearly doubling since 2011.

**Early outcomes:** Existing treatment modalities and clinical research have proven integrated models improves clinical outcomes (e.g, EDSM at Zuckerburg SF, CCBHCs, ACT). More recently, MCOs around the country have shown that these integrated models can not only improve clinical outcomes, but also drive down costs. In 2018, Community Mental Health Center Healthcare Homes in Missouri saved $289 PMPM (~$3,468 PMPY) driven by a 28% reduction in hospitalizations

## Page 6

and a 41% decrease in annual ED visits. In New York state, Montefiore and Northwell health systems operated the Care Transitions Support Services (CTSS) model for SMI patients from 2015 to 2019. The program demonstrated a savings of $833 PMPM (~$9,996 PMPY). Similar to the Missouri program, these savings were driven by a reduction in hospitalizations even with increased spend on behavioral health outpatient services.

_i. Medicaid claims are often incomplete due to delays in billing, disputed bills, and other irregularities. In order to ensure completeness a minimum three-month lag is included in all MDW claims analyses._

**Tech-enabled Engagement, Screening and Management:** Historically, there have been challenges in the SMI population due to the inability to simply monitor where patients are located (e.g. % of transitory or homeless patients). Existing technology can improve how we identify, screen, monitor and manage prospective patients, facilitate care transitions and delivery and continuously monitor relevant patient behavior and general activity. Screening assessments such as K6 & K10 scales can either be self-administered or interviewer-administered within minutes <5 minutes and are statistically significant predictors of SMI (vs GHQ-12).

**Behavioral Health Stigma Reduction & Associated Research:** In the past decade we have seen increased support for mental & behavioral health awareness. With greater awareness and improved access to behavioral care, amongst other things,

## Page 7

there has been a growing body of research that suggests cost savings are likely to derive from medical co-morbidities which are often unsuccessfully treated when behavioral and medical considerations are treated separately.

### Clinical Model

Amae is a full-service outpatient psychiatric and primary care provider for individuals with SMI. Led by psychiatry, Amae utilizes a holistic treatment approach to directly address both the mental and physical needs of SMI patients to improve long-term patient outcomes, lower the total cost of care, and enable patients to lead a more meaningful life. Amae's product represents a fundamental shift in SMI patient care as its deeply focused on longitudinal, whole person (mental + physical) care opposed to traditional FFS based behavioral health models that have proliferated in recent years.

### Amae Health Patient Engagement Model

**Phase 1. Engage (Day 0)**
*   **Key Steps:**
    *   **Amae Engager:** Connects with patients at the hospital prior to discharge. Meets the patient with kindness (e.g., fresh baked goods and flowers). Introduces the Amae program, receives consent for medical records and treatment, and fills out patient member information.
    *   **Member Dashboard:** The Amae member's medical and social determinant's of health (SDoH) information is collected and documented, serving as the basis for their personalized care plan.
    *   **ED Triage:** If Amae Health is embedded within the ED, patients are triaged and treated for SMI or other presenting conditions.
    *   **Amae Engager Notified:** Amae Engager is notified of the member prior to discharge.

**Phase 2. Stabilize (Day 1-7)**
*   **Key Steps:**
    *   **Care Coordinator:** Conducts in-person visits to the Amae member and sets up initial clinical appointments, including transportation.
    *   **Personalized Stability Plan:** Created, along with a comprehensive care program for continued medical evaluations, check-ins, monitoring, and support across SDoH.
    *   **Clinical:**
        *   **Housing Setup:** Helps establish living arrangements if a psychiatrist is supported by a care attendant based on existing status (Homeless, Living Alone, Family/Caregiver).
        *   **Telepsych Eval:** A telepsychiatry evaluation if a psychiatrist is not supported.
        *   **Psychiatrist and Nurse Practitioner:** Work together to document files & care and home records.
        *   **Medication Management:** Develop a medication and treatment plan, including lab work and evaluations for comorbidities of health ailments.
    *   **SDOH:**
        *   **Support System Housing:** Care coordinator follows through in establishing safe housing and other SDOH factors (partnering with member's support system, and conducting acceptance & trust building programs).

**Phase 3. Recover (Day 8-21)**
*   **Key Steps:**
    *   Amae Member continues to be treated and evaluated for medication side effects, and engaged in their care program. They expand upon both their clinical treatment and SDoH treatment, with added education and support.
    *   **Additional Engagement:**
        *   **Clinical:**
            *   Medication and comorbidity adherence monitoring and physical health check-ups.
            *   Diabetes prevention program (DPP), substance use disorder (SUD) program.
        *   **Community & Holistic Health:**
            *   Nutrition program, exercise regimens monitoring.
            *   Support system training.
            *   Community integration.
            *   Education.
            *   Mindfulness and meditation training.
        *   **Amae Peer Mentor:** Member is assigned a peer mentor, an individual with similar lived experiences, to bond with based on their story.
        *   **Hybrid Model for Effective Care Delivery:** Physical data tracking enables and delivers digital therapeutics.

**Phase 4. Prosper (Day 22-30+)**
*   **Key Steps:**
    *   Amae Member works to implement their prosperity pact through setting goals and key milestones in partnership with their peer mentor and clinical care team. Once met, they remain engaged with Amae on an as-needed basis via our hybrid approach.
    *   **Amae Prosperity Pact:**
        *   **Psychiatrist:** Works with the member to achieve the prosperity pact.
        *   **Peer Mentor:** Supports member in completing their Amae Prosperity Pact, a set of measurable goals to establish meaning in a member's life including:
            *   Job training (e.g., paying coding bootcamps).
            *   Financial management training.
            *   Education (GED/Community College).
            *   Additional psychotherapy.
            *   Confidence building.
            *   Relationship support.
        *   Members will also be responsible for engaging in local community service efforts and volunteering in order that they are contributing to their community and helping others - evidence to having patients gain meaning in life.

Amae's offering includes three core components for all engaged patients:

*   **Amae Care Center:** Amae will develop facilities in target markets to serve as a combined community center and outpatient clinic that provides education, mentorship and socialization in addition to a full suite of primary and psychiatric care services for engaged SMI patients.
*   **Amae Support System:** All patients will be assigned an 'Amae Peer Mentor' that is responsible for holding patients accountable to their treatment plans and facilitating opportunities for patients to re-establish purpose / meaning in their lives.
*   **Amae Digital Patient Platform:** A single EHR and patient health platform that will integrate remote patient monitoring, treatment plan adherence tracking,

video and asynchronous visits to enable care providers to effectively view / monitor / manage a holistic view of a patient's health.

### Business Model / Go-to-Market

Over the long-term, (3+ years), Amae intends on entering full-risk capitation arrangements with payers to manage the full scope of an SMI patients' health, similar to other specialty based models in CKD/ESRD, oncology, and MSK. A majority of these initial customers will be Medicaid MCOs. Leading up to full-risk arrangements, Amae will partner with payers to create value-based care arrangements using bundled payments or shared risk contracts for engaged Amae patients. Payments will likely reflect a patient's historical cost of care, and will largely have upside risk only. In a scenario where these initial VBC contracts are delayed, Amae can utilize FFS reimbursement codes (e.g., ACT for $20K-$25K per year in NY) on state-by-state basis to gain initial adoption.

Amae's initial go-to-market motion will be focused on securing value-based care arrangements with a Managed Care Organization (MCO), and then will seek to partner with health systems / hospitals that the MCO's patients most frequently utilize. Amae will have dedicated staff at partnered hospitals to capture SMI patients in the ED post-discharge, and direct them to an Amae provider for follow-up care. In addition to value-based arrangements, we anticipate that Amae will monetize their hospital partnership via PMPM payments for SMI patient readmission prevention but we are viewing these health system revenues as upside only in our financial scenarios.

The health plan contracting (top-down) and health system focused engagement (bottoms-up) requires Amae to focus on specific geographies or regions as the company rolls out its care model. While this model requires additional operational capacity, it is valuable in driving initial engagement, 30-day program completion, and long term retention. In addition, SMI prevalence is higher in urban areas, which gives the company the ability to be hyper-focused in the resources they deploy. In a top 20 metro in the US, for example, the company can reasonably expect to engage 500 patients from a single hospital per year. If Amae can execute on its top-down / bottoms-up model across 3 states, it can generate $50M+ in revenue per year (assuming conservatively $10K per patient). Identifying and engaging the highest cost individuals ($40K-$50K) in these urban areas provides an initial opportunity to establish a footprint and then scale the

## Page 9

model efficiently (e.g., panel size per psychiatrist, logistics, collaborations with community-based organizations) in these higher margin patients. We believe it will be incumbent for management to dovetail the above considerations with initially prioritizing states that have the most favorable behavioral carve-in arrangements to inform early GTM strategy.

### Competitive Landscape

While there are a number of solutions that have been developed for lower acuity mental health conditions, the landscape for solutions in SMI is still in its infancy. With limited data available to-date on the effectiveness of pharmacological and digital therapeutics in SMI, integrated whole-person care models show promise. Due to a combination of regulatory tailwinds, rising behavioral awareness, and

## Page 10

success of analogous care models, amongst others, we expect a flurry of SMI NewCo formation in the next 12-24 months.

### Direct competitors:

*   **Firsthand** – Firsthand is the most direct competitor to Amae. Samir Malik (CEO) has worked in the SMI space at multiple previous companies (OneDocWay, Genoa, UHG) and was most recently at United Healthcare for 3 years before launching Firsthand. He left his role at United in 2021 with $15M in initial capital and contracts in hand to launch in 3 states in 2022. Similar to Amae, the model leverages peer support to better engage patients and help them prosper over the long-term. Firsthand is also developing VBC contracting arrangements with payers in a capitated model. Firsthand's model is less clinical (e.g., only peer support vs. psychiatrist support) and its initial value proposition for payers is focused on risk-adjustment, as opposed to improved clinical outcomes or reductions in total cost of care.
*   **Vanna Health.** While we have little direct information on company status and/or what specifically they are building, Gio Collela, CEO/Co-founder, is well known amongst healthcare circles having previously founded Castlight, Ooda and Brightline.
*   **Humana** - Senior SMI NewCo. In conversations with executive leadership at Humana we learned that they are pursuing a $10M JV to create an SMI NewCo focused on their senior population. In our dialogue, it was clear that Humana sees a tangible ROI model for treating SMI via an integrated, psychiatric led care model, and have been searching for a vendor partner over the last 12 months until the decision was made to incubate with an outside capital partner. We have not been able to confirm who the capital partner(s) is though we have educated suspicions.
*   **Tele-behavioral health providers** (Valera, AptiHealth, Mindstrong, Brave Health)
    *   **Brave Health** (total funding of $20.75M) focuses exclusively on the medicaid population and offers outpatient services (therapy, psychiatry, case management, MAT) for mental health and addiction through its virtual behavioral health platform. The company has

    *   historically focused on treating individuals with substance-use disorder (SUD), which has a strong overlap with SMI (>35% of SMI patients also have a SUD)
    *   **Valera Health** (total funding of $26.9M) assigns each patient a behavioral health care manager and has psychiatrists and psychiatric nurse practitioners on the back-end to prescribe medications. The company has a broader focus beyond SMI patients (e.g., ADHD, mild/moderate anxiety and depression), but has increased its focus in the SMI space over the last 2-3 years. Target customers are health plans along with some innovative health systems, such as Northwell Health and Montefiore.
    *   **AptiHealth** (total funding $65M) is focused on individuals with SMI and has a more comprehensive care model that includes a network of PCP providers for patients with intensive therapy needs. The company sells to health plans and partners with health systems in target markets. The company has struggled to move beyond case rates and FFS reimbursement with health plans to-date.
    *   **Mindstrong** (total funding $160M) was initially focused on building smartphone-based digital biomarkers to screen for and diagnose a wide-range of mental health disorders. After struggling to commercialize, Humana, one of its early customers, pushed the company to focus more on SMI. Today, the company is almost exclusively focused on SMI and focuses more on the telebehavioral health network than the digital biomarker the company initially invested in.

### Strengths

*   **Proven Clinical Model:** Amae's clinical approach for SMI management has been proven to effectively improve the personal well-being of SMI patients, and drive significant cost savings to payors / health systems by reducing avoidable patient readmissions by up to 27%. These outcomes have been validated through clinical studies conducted by top institutions, including the VA, University of Washington, and Allina Health.

*   **Validated Market Need:** There has been considerable push into the Mental Health space over the last 20+ months of the pandemic, which has been accelerated by favorable reimbursement programs across commercial and governmental payors, the 21st Century Cures act, and growing cultural acceptance of mental health disorders. Further, in our market validation conversations, Humana leadership identified SMI as a key priority for 2022 and has since allocated $10M in capital to launch their own SMI business this year.
*   **Large, Untapped Market:** Representing ~$200B of annual healthcare expenditure, the US SMI market is significant, and completely untouched without any leading brands. Though several early stage start ups have demonstrated focus on the SMI space (e.g. Firsthand), we believe the market will support multiple winners to accommodate for the growing SMI population. From 2008 to 2019, the prevalence of SMI in individuals 18-years or older grew at a CAGR of 4.2%. This increasing prevalence was only exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Risks / Areas of Focus

*   **Health System Centric GTM:** Hospitals continue to manage / suffer through unparalleled circumstances with the Covid pandemic, and as such, may not be receptive to new partnership opportunities in the near team. Further, Amae will need to develop clear value propositions to potential health system partners to minimize system concerns over lost referral volume. In the interim, we are confident in Amae's ability to capture patient lives through value-based arrangements with health plans.
*   **Clinical Staff Recruitment:** The rapid acceleration of the Mental Health space over the last 20+ months will require creative recruitment strategies to rapidly source and hire care teams (e.g., Psychology, Psychiatry, etc.) that will drive Amae's clinical model. Although recruiting, hiring, and retaining the best talent will be a continued area of focus, Amae offers a unique value proposition in the SMI market. Providers at FQHCs or community-based organizations (CBOs) are overburdened, lack ownership, and do not have technology tools at their disposal to improve care management. Amae's clinical approach and

business model gives mission-driven providers the ability to fulfill their clinical goals and dreams.

*   **Cost Model:** Amae's planned clinical model may be capital intensive, especially if they build de novo Community Care Centers, and support full-risk based arrangements long term. Comparable VBC care delivery companies in CKD/ESRD, SUD, MSK, and mental health have raised $100M+ in total funding. The commitment to a service-heavy model is a recognition that integrated models of care are required to move the needle on outcomes and the margins (30%-50%) companies with successful VBC contracts can generate in this high-cost, inefficiently managed patient population. The service-heavy model will always be a foundation of the company's clinical DNA, but the company will have the flexibility to adapt as the care model expands based on careful cost/benefit analyses. In some areas, for example, the company may be able to partner with community centers or repurpose existing spaces rather than building de-novo.
*   **Contracting & Unit Economics:** We have validated a 2X-5X total cost of care increase per SMI patient (vs average non-SMI patient) yet there is mixed research on the timeline for ROI associated with the integrated care model that Amae is proposing. We have conservatively estimated a $20K PMPY for each individual SMI patient although we have reason to believe that this could realistically be as high as $40K -$50K PMPY (see behavioral comps in ASD, eating disorder). These high-cost patients give Amae the ability to prove out their model, build operational scale, and expand access to lower-cost patients with less margin given MLR ratios for MCOs.
*   **Engagement Model:** Stratifying and onboarding early 'attractive' patients and ensuring superior activation rates (5-10%) in order to demonstrate efficacy of engagement model and provide early proxy for clinical and cost model success. While its health system GTM strategy requires additional upfront costs, the investment is worthwhile given the impact on initial engagement and long-term retention.
