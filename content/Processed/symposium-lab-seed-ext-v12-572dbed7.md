## Slide 1: De-Risking Clinical Trials with AI + Expert Reinforcement

# De-Risking Clinical Trials with AI + Expert Reinforcement

**Symposium Lab**

Aug 2023

## Slide 2: Poor Patient Identification for Clinical Trials

# Poor Patient Identification for Clinical Trials

Poor patient identification makes clinical trials difficult and time consuming.

**Symposium Lab**

# 32%
Phase 3 Failures Attributed to Poor Patient Identification and Selection

# 1/3
Of Overall Trial Duration Spent on Patient Identification and Selection

## Slide 3: Why Is Patient Identification Difficult?

# Why Is Patient Identification Difficult?

**Symposium Lab**

It is a process of trying to balance multiple competing factors, affecting external validity and raising social equity concerns.

### Safety Concerns
Inadequate exclusion criteria
→ Unacceptably high adverse event rates

### Efficacy Issues
Poorly specified eligibility criteria
→ Negatively affect treatment effect size

### Financial Burdens
Overly stringent eligibility criteria
→ Hamper the rate of enrollment

## Slide 4: The Cost of Clinical Trials

**Symposium Lab**

# The Cost of Clinical Trials

Even though the direct cost of clinical trials represent less than one percent of the average total cost of developing a new drug, clinical trials are pivotal to the overall success.

# $19M
Median cost of clinical trials that support FDA approvals

# $3B
Average total cost of developing a new drug

*(Chart: 2x2 matrix with "High Efficacy" and "Low Efficacy" on the X-axis, and "Low Safety" and "High Safety" on the Y-axis. The matrix is color-coded with a legend:)*

**Legend:**
*   High Likelihood of Approval (Light Blue)
*   Moderate LOA (Medium Blue)
*   Low LOA (Grey)
*   No LOA (Dark Grey)

*   **Upper Right Quadrant (High Efficacy, High Safety):** High Likelihood of Approval (Light Blue)

## Slide 10: Principles Defining Our Product Vision

**Symposium Lab**

# Principles Defining Our Product Vision

Time is money but time is also controlled by FDA compliance.

---
**Speed** (Icon: Fast forward symbol)
As drug discovery is supercharged by AI models, validation of new drug candidates needs to match the speed.

**Compliance** (Icon: Shield with checkmark)
Commercial progress is largely determined by FDA's compliance requirements, which makes compliance a top priority.

**Explainability** (Icon: Person with chart)
To be compliant, models need be explainable to all stakeholders and its underlying mechanism should make scientific sense.

## Slide 11: Model Library

**Symposium Lab**

# Model Library

We are building advanced models as our data accumulation compounds and regulation clarifies.

---
### Short Term
**Propensity-Score-Weighted Models**
*   Our current model is anchored in the well-established method of Propensity Scoring.
*   By building the data platform, we can derive a combined analysis through meta-analysis techniques based on all sub-section PS-weighted multivariate models.

### Long Term
**Digital Twin (AGCI)**
*   AGCI stands for Artificial Generative Clinical Trial Intelligence, which is our proprietary drug response predicting model
*   We are building it based on phenotypes from EHR data, similar drug's in-vitro/in-vivo preclinical results, and drug similarity score.
