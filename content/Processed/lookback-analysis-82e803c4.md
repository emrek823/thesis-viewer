## Slide 4:
86% of claims denials are avoidable, yet denial rates continue to rise due to a lack of actionable intelligence and automation in the revenue cycle.

*   Disparate systems and a lack of data connectivity have resulted in insufficient visibility within the healthcare revenue cycle.
*   Most providers don't know how much they are losing due to inefficient billing workflows, and worse yet, most don't know how to proactively address areas of revenue leakage.

## Slide 5: Introducing Adonis.
# Introducing Adonis.
Adonis is the Intelligence and Automation platform for modern healthcare organizations.

Our mission is to identify and fix missed revenue opportunities and plug revenue leakage, allowing providers to focus on what matters most: patient care.

*(Note: The chart displays the total denial rate trend. The legend indicates two components: "Denied, Successfully Appealed (%)" and "Denied, No Successful Appeals (%)". The visual suggests the successfully appealed portion is the lower part of the bar, and the unsuccessfully appealed portion is the upper part. The overall denial rate shown is 5.2% in Sep, while the chart shows higher values, indicating the chart might be illustrating a different metric or a broader scope than the current 5.2% metric. Based on the visual, the absolute denial rates shown in the chart are much higher than the 5.2% displayed in the KPI. The chart seems to indicate a range of 15-20% denial rates for the shown months. I will capture the values as visually represented in the chart, noting this discrepancy.)*
*(Re-evaluation of the denial rate chart: The chart shows two stacked bar segments for "Denied, Successfully Appealed (%)" and "Denied, No Successful Appeals (%)". The total height of the bar represents the overall denial rate. The KPI states 5.2% denial rate. The chart shows rates ranging from 15% to 20%. This is a discrepancy between the text KPI and the visual representation. I will transcribe what is visible in the graph bars.)*

## Slide 8: Executive Summary for Redacted
# Executive Summary for Redacted
Revenue Lookback Approach: Adonis completed a Lookback Analysis for Redacted, with a focus on improving biller experience and reducing denials. To do this analysis, Adonis used advanced Data Science techniques to analyze over 14 million rows of data, across over 100s of provider groups and 1,000s of providers.

**Biller Experience Insights**
*   **8,000 claims per day**
    *   **Daily Claim Volume**
    *   [Redacted] intakes and submits an impressive amount of claims per day, trends from this data can improve biller experience.
*   **>50 days on average**
    *   **DOS to Submission Days**
    *   Select locations and CPT codes have a high DOS to submission timeline, suggesting additional focus required on certain processes.
*   **62 days on average**
    *   **Denial to Appeal Days**
    *   Great progress has been made in recent months but improved prioritization can drive response time even lower.

**Denials Analytics**
*   **65% avoidable denial rate**
    *   **Denial Modeling**
    *   Large amounts of low hanging fruit exists to reduce backend denials and improve productivity.
*   **9% of denied claims**
    *   **Timely Filing**
    *   Empowering billing teams with better alerting and worklists can greatly reduce avoidable denial rates.
*   **20% of claims edited**
    *   **Athena Scrubbing Engine**
    *   Athena flags 20% of claims to edit, however, improving scrubbing effectiveness can reduce backend denials.

## Slide 10: Opportunities Remain for Prioritization of Submissions
# Opportunities Remain for Prioritization of Submissions

*   **Average of 20 days from service to submission**
    Number of days remains constant but is above industry averages, leading to timely filing denials.
*   **Average of 18 days from submission to remittance**
    Average is well below payer deadlines but individual claims should be monitored.
*   **Average of 62 days from denial to appeal**
    While recent trend is positive, appeal timeline remains high and could benefit from enhanced prioritization.

**Line Chart Data: Submission Timelines**
*   **Y-axis:** Days (0 to 90)
*   **X-axis:** Q3 2021, Q4 2021, Q1 2022, Q2 2022
*   **Note:** -50% YoY decrease for denial to appeals
