# Clara Foundational Consumer Research Findings

## Executive Summary
This macro ethnographic research is intended to provide a better foundational understanding of the experiences of individuals responsible for providing and coordinating at-home care for aging or disabled individuals in need. These findings will be used to help direct initial strategic decisions for Clara including business model and product development direction.

The research was conducted over a period of weeks from Nov. 2023-April 2024 and consisted of 15 30-45 minute 1:1 Zoom interviews.

## Insights
* These were the most salient insights from this round of research. They help illustrate the mindset of the home care consumer in 2024.
    1. Home care is strongly preferred to institutional care by patients and their families.
    2. Providing and managing care is often the #1 priority for “care coordinators", especially while establishing a regular care schedule and system
    3. Overall satisfaction with the home care ecosystem is low.
        Common pain points include:
        a. Inconsistent care coverage and quality, with difficulty finding high-quality caregivers
        b. A lack of available resources and guidance, leading to low consumer confidence
        c. Cost/affordability of care, especially when projecting into the future
        d. Challenges managing logistics including scheduling, payment and bookkeeping
    4. Home care agencies are nearly universally disliked and either avoided or viewed as a necessary evil. Consumers do not believe they provide good value, nor that they effectively control care quality
    5. Most participants have tried multiple caregiving solutions in an effort to find satisfactory care, including both agencies and independent employment

| Paid cash (unreported)   | 3          | 20.00%     |

See "Pain Points”, “Insights” and “Appendices” sections for more details

## Competitor Awareness/Utilization
* Only 3/15 (20%) had utilized potential competitor offerings. 1 participant tried using care.com but was not able to successfully find a match. 2 other participants had used "A Place for Mom" to look for assisted living facilities

## Opportunities
There are 3 apparent opportunities for innovation in the space based on these findings:
1. Affordable, home care-specific payroll & tax software
2. AI-enabled care management platform + concierge service
3. Robust, quality-controlled 2-sided caregiver marketplace

See "Opportunities" section for more details

## Research Objectives
These interviews were intended to provide qualitative information on consumers' overarching "care journey” from start to finish. Four specific areas of focus were:
1. Logistical details of care management: How did participants determine at-home care was necessary? How did they find care? Arrange logistics? Manage roles and responsibilities? Maintain care over months/years?
2. Emotional impact of care management on responsible/involved family members, and how it affected behavior
3. Financial logistics and considerations: Were finances a factor in decision-making? How easy/difficult is it to afford care? How easy/difficult is the payment process
4. Consumer satisfaction with the overarching at-home care experience, including quality of care received, ease-of-navigation, and perceived value for dollars spent

## Methodology
* Participant Recruitment: Participants were recruited via outreach across multiple friends & family networks
* Data Collection: Data was collected through structured 30-45 minute 1:1 Zoom interviews

Demographic Summary:
* Avg. Age = 59
* 93% (14/15) Female
* 80% (12/15) White
* 80% (12/15) Bachelor's degree or higher

## Key Findings
### Pain Points
1.  **Care Quality**
    14/15 (93%) participants expressed concerns about the quality of caregivers, especially those provided by agencies, including their skills, experience, and compatibility with the care recipient
    *   Participants scored the quality of the care they received at a ~3.55 on a scale of 1-5 (with 5 being the highest). However 13/15 (87%) participants openly described bad experiences they had with at least one caregiver over the course of their journey
    *   Participants scored the ease of finding satisfactory care at ~3.5 on a scale of 1-5 (with 5 being most difficult)
2.  **Cost/affordability**
    >50% of participants reported being somewhat or very concerned about long-term affordability of care
    *   "We really didn't have a choice and towards the end of my dad's life he was really running low on cash” - Participant 4
    *   "If we're looking ten years from now it will be a [bigger issue]...because right now it's >$100k/year" - Participant 1
    *   "You want to make the right choice and make sure you wind up with the right people, but you need to take into account that her income is very small at this point and you want to preserve what she has for as long as possible because you don't know how long she is going to need it for." - Participant 2
    *   "My mom was always concerned. Very concerned...She didn't want to lose everything. She wanted to leave something behind" - Participant 5
    *   "When it was getting further towards the end and we would need to put him back in a facility we were looking at the cost. $5-6k/month for my dad. Mom would want to go with him, that's $10-12k/month. One of the reasons we kept him at home is it was cheaper." - Participant 10
    Even those who were not concerned about their ability to pay were value-conscious
    *   "They [financial considerations] haven't been central, though my stepfather constantly remarks on how much it's costing" - Participant 8
    *   "I was looking for value for the dollar but didn't lose sleep over it." - Participant 9

3.  **Care Coordination & Logistics**
    Participants almost universally encountered challenges with agencies, such as unreliable caregivers, scheduling issues, and lack of communication. Many participants took on the responsibility of coordinating care for their loved ones, managing schedules and payroll, which they described as time-consuming and emotionally draining.
    *   Agencies, even when they claim to manage finances, often make mistakes or intentionally mislead consumers:
        *   "I've spoken to the agency about this and they say we're sending a statement, but their invoices are always wrong." - Participant 1
    *   Payroll services were cumbersome and difficult to use
        *   Solutions found by consumers varied. One used Quickbooks. One used Ceridian. One used Homepay, etc.
        *   "I guess I wish I wouldn't have had to do all the accounting work. To have someone else do the accounting. An agency or service provider that could provide that service that wouldn't gouge me." - Participant 9
        *   "[I wish] that it wouldn't be so hodgepodge and checkerboard. That it would be, you pay for a service and you get a service.” - Participant 8
        *   “I wish I didn't have to enter the hours every week or two" - Participant 4
4.  **Lack of available resources and guidance**
    Most participants claimed they had done little-to-no online research. 7/15 (47%) bemoaned the lack of good online resources and specifically requested a “resource hub" or "all-in-one platform that tells you everything you need to know."
    *   "If I could wave a wand it would just happen automatically. It was all new territory for us, so all these things that would have been available or were available or could have been available, they were difficult to find.” - Participant 5
    *   Many participants mentioned using agencies because they didn't know how else to find someone: “We didn't know how else to get anybody" - Participant 2
5.  **Emotional Toll**
    Caregiving was described as an emotional experience, with feelings of guilt, stress, and uncertainty about whether they were doing enough for their loved ones

## Insights
1.  **Home care is strongly preferred to institutional care by patients and their families.**
    Obviously this research is subject to selection bias, as I only interviewed home care based cases. However on this point the responses were unanimous and unequivocal
2.  **Providing and managing care is a top priority for family "care coordinators” above financial concerns, convenience, reliability, etc.**
    *   ~80% of participants categorized caregiving as “my number one focus day-to-day" for at some period of time, despite having professional assistance in the home.
        *   All participants emphasized the stress of being responsible for a loved one's care, describing the role as "taxing", "all-consuming", "draining”, “unsettling”, “a rollercoaster”, “stressful”, “a lot of responsibility”, “exasperating”, “very tiring”, “very fatiguing”, “rough”, "saddening”, and “conflicting".
        *   >30% mentioned experiencing feelings of guilt at not being able to do more
        *   >30% described feeling gratified describing the experience as "rewarding” or “a privilege” in addition to being stressful
    *   ~90% of participants identified aide/care quality and reliability as the “most important factor considered when looking for a caregiving solution"
        *   "We wanted them to be skilled, compassionate, knowledgeable, kind...patient and understanding” - Participant 9
        *   Genuine people... [that would] dedicate themselves to their job when they're here" - Participant 7
        *   "Someone who could relate to what she was going through and understand what she needed without her even having to say or ask for it" - Participant 6
        *   "Someone who was a caring person" - Participant 5
        *   "Someone that my mom would be compatible with. Trustworthy. Not steal from her or take advantage of her because she couldn't see. Trust" - Participant 2
        *   "Quality of caregiver - wanted to know what kind of certifications they had. How much experience they had working with elderly, blind & cognitively impaired patients." - Participant 1
3.  **Overall satisfaction with the home care ecosystem is low**
    and emotional investment in seeing improvements industry-wide is high

*   14/15 (93%) participants had had at least one negative experience either looking for a caregiver, with the caregivers themselves, or managing the administrative overhead of managing care. Many participants remarked on the importance of this issue, and how intensely they wanted to see the system reformed/improved.
4.  **Home care agencies are generally disliked**
    and either avoided or viewed as a necessary evil. Participants primarily complained about agency's inconsistent care quality, high costs, personnel management and administrative dysfunction
    *   "Agencies are more expensive...I still think we came out better by hiring on our own" - Participant 5
    *   "Spoke to a few agencies. Problem with agencies is they couldn't promise they would have the same person there everyday. The plus side is that they would substitute, but I knew it would make my mom anxious to have someone new everyday, and wanted to protect my mom's dignity." - Participant 5
    *   "[Agency] had done a crappy job... [and was] really expensive for the level of return we were getting on the care...I feel that the middleman is taking advantage of both sides" - Participant 3
    *   "Owner of the agency was kind of rude with me. That was the most frustrating for me." - Participant 6
    *   "In the beginning it was quite often [agency switching up the aides sent]. It's minimized now because we [agency and she] have a rapport. The first two years were rough" - Participant 7
    *   "One thing that was clear to me in the beginning is that the people who were sent from an agency who were very good got pulled onto other jobs because they were such prized employees, so what you find is that the agencies get their hooks in the client, and then when the client is happy with some of the services, but they want to get more clients, they take the people away and put them on other cases, and they give you the B team" - Participant 8
    *   "The agencies make money off sending people into the field and collecting it from the clients who don't have alternatives, so you're stuck." - Participant 8
    *   "The reason why we picked $25/hr is because she was being paid $12/hr and the agency was taking the rest. We said we'd give her what we'd pay the agency and you can keep all of it" - Participant 10
    *   "You get what you get. One time they sent over a pregnant woman who was asking the patient to help her pick things off the ground...not an appropriate situation" - Participant 14

5.  **Most participants have tried multiple solutions**
    *   in an effort to find satisfactory care. 13/15 (87%) had used an agency at least once, while 12/15 (80%) had hired caregivers independently (outside of an agency)
6.  **Level of urgency varies**
    *   More than half of participants described their need for a caregiver when searching for a solution as “urgent” or “very urgent”. However there did not seem to be a correlation between urgency and overall satisfaction with the care they ultimately found. Those who had more time to search for care were not significantly more satisfied with their care solution, nor more confident that they had found the best possible care.

## User Personas
Most personas demographically cover the similar populations. They are predominantly women aged 50-75, caring for aging parents, stepparents, parents-in-law, or (less frequently) spouses or other relatives. They are differentiated primarily by their financial situations, and level of experience/fluency in the home care ecosystem.

1.  **The Seeker**
    Entering the caregiving market for the first time. Lacks knowledge and confidence. Needs guidance, reassurance and resources. Does not have many leads for where to find care and struggles to get off the ground. Often needs to find help urgently and is juggling the need to find professional care while struggling to meet their loved one's care needs themself.
2.  **The Optimizer**
    The Optimizer has exposure to/experience with the home care system and is looking to improve their situation. They often look to reduce costs, improve quality of care, retain their favorite care workers and reduce/eliminate the need for others, or streamline payroll management. They consider themselves an “amateur expert”, and are confident they know the general lay of the land.
3.  **The Benefits Navigator**
    The Benefits Navigator is primarily focused on maximizing the quantity and quality of care they can extract from their benefits package. This often involves working with lawyers and social workers to apply for, and maintain eligibility for Medicaid, but may also include working with Medicare Advantage plans or other private insurers. Paradoxically the benefits navigator does not concern herself with the cost of care once established, as all payment is managed directly between government agencies/insurance companies and care provider agencies directly. The Benefits Navigator is unlikely to hire caregivers independently, as agencies are much more capable of securing benefits funding than independent caregivers.

## Opportunities
There are numerous opportunities to improve the existing system. These are arranged in perceived order of promise according to a framework of impact vs. effort, taking into account technical complexity and competition.

1.  **Low-cost, home care-specific payroll software**
    The >50% of participants that hired caregivers independently and did not feel comfortable paying all caregivers in cash utilized a diverse patchwork of payroll solutions including Quickbooks, Ceridian, HomePay, and others. None of these software solutions are purpose-built, and many are intimidating/challenging for consumers to navigate.
    There is an unmet for low-cost, purpose-built software that walks consumers through the required steps and abstracts away complexity
2.  **AI concierge + care management platform**
    For "Seekers” and those looking for resources and reassurance (~50% of participants), AI chatbots and other creative applications of generative AI offer the chance to help individuals gain knowledge and confidence in a unique, personalized, and interactive way. This concierge service can also work as an on-ramp to the other products/services listed below, and act as a differentiator from existing solutions in the space
    Care management features such as improved care worker communication, location tracking, IoT integrations etc. will solve provide comfort and knowledge to care coordinators geographically dislocated from care recipients, deepen the value they receive from the Clara platform, and provide Clara with robust care worker performance data to leverage in marketplace matching
3.  **2-sided caregiver marketplace**
    Consumers are value-sensitive and quality-conscious. Their perception is that agencies do not provide good value and do not do a good job of quality control. For those who needed to find a caregiver from scratch, or those dissatisfied with their initial care providers (~50% of participants) a marketplace with vetted, quality controlled leads for caregivers may help individuals locate and vet independent care providers in their area, and provide better real and perceived value

## Limitations
*   Small sample size of N = 15
*   Lack of diversity in sample, with most participants demographically similar
*   Recorded nature of calls may have inhibited participant honesty, especially when discussing potentially illegal behavior such as paying caregivers in cash, or otherwise skirting employment and tax law

## Appendix A
Participants were asked to provide scores on a scale of 1-5 across a number of dimensions. Their aggregated responses confirm that while participants were generous in assessing the overall quality of care they received, they are dissatisfied with the process of finding care, and concerned about long-term affordability
