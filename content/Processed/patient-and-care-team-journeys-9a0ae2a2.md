## Slide 1: Patient and Care Team Journeys

Reset
Kidney Health

Patient and Care Team Journeys

JANUARY 2024

## Slide 2: Health plans share a list of CKD members based on established criteria

Health Plans → Batch CKD Qualifier for Reset Referral → Eligible members

Based on current customer partnerships, we typically receive CKD Stage 3 and 4 members:
*   Not actively managed by a Nephrologist.
*   With RAF scores less than 1, irrespective of whether the member has a Nephrologist.
*   Has a history of hospitalization.
*   Uncontrolled hypertension.

## Slide 3: Reset performs a multi-channel outreach to engage members.

CKD 3 & 4 members from the health plan → 10 days from sent date → Reset sends co-branded letter to members → Within 5 days → Reset Kidney Care Guides proactively call the member → Reset Kidney Care Guide calls up to 5 times until a successful appointment

Call outcomes are tracked and analyzed to improve engagement campaigns and shared with the payor.

Agreed upon script for letters and phone calls
Core messaging and tone around kidney screening by specialist to avoid shock and worries
Clean message that this is at no costs to member and covered by the plan.
50%+ of the contracted members engage with Reset

## Slide 9: Field Outreach for Critical Unresponsive members

*   In cases where a member at risk cannot be reached by phone, the Reset Tech Platform triggers an alert to the Reset Care Guide, prompting immediate and proactive field outreach.
*   This involves dispatching a Reset field representative, who could be a phlebotomist, home health aide, or nurse assistant, to visit the member at their home.
*   During this visit, the representative facilitates direct communication between the member and the Reset Care Team, ensuring a swift and effective response to the member's urgent healthcare needs.
*   This process is designed to provide timely intervention and prevent the escalation of the member's condition, potentially averting the need for emergency dialysis.

15

## Slide 17: Facilitating Transplants

*   When a member's GFR approaches 22, we start dedicated conversations about their options as they near kidney failure. This aims to prevent dialysis crashes, improve preemptive transplants, and increase home dialysis adoption.
*   A Nephrology Nurse Practitioner conducts over six hours of member education, covered by Medicare. These sessions educate members about their disease, future options, and trade-offs.
*   We place a strong emphasis on persuading members, when medically appropriate, to consider a transplant. We encourage them to discuss with friends and family to find potential living donors.
*   If no living donors are found within their immediate circle, we assist members in using social media to find potential living donors nationwide. We've seen significant early success in finding living donors through these methods.

16

## Slide 18: Transition to dialysis
Phase 1 - Education and Assessment

Reset Kidney Health orchestrates a detailed and timely transition for CKD Stage 4/5 patients to dialysis, emphasizing precise coordination and comprehensive support at each stage.
