Solstice
Automating the clinical data retrieval process for community practices

## Slide 2: Problem
Problem
Finding patient records is time-consuming and expensive.

Context
Prior to a patient's initial visit, community practices need copies of each patient's complete medical records for treatment decisions. Without them, they must postpone or cancel appointments.

**Process Breakdown:**
*   **Records Request:** Community practice sends fax or EHR¹ Access request.
*   **Records Release:** Multiple healthcare facilities release records via fax or EHR.
*   **Filtering Records:** Received documents (e.g., Labs, Progress Notes) are filtered (some marked 'X' for rejection, others checked for acceptance).
*   **Structuring Records:** Filtered records are then structured.

This process takes on average 2 hours and costs $80 per patient, amounting to $125bn annually.

## Slide 3: Solution
Solution
Solstice is a fully automated medical records retrieval pipeline.

We automate the medical records processing for community practices by:
1.  **RETRIEVING** all necessary information from relevant providers;
2.  **FILTERING** to identify exactly the information necessary for the doctor to provide care, and;
3.  **STRUCTURING** this information into an easily consumed report.

## Slide 4: Product: Retrieval
Product: Retrieval
We retrieve longitudinal clinical information from providers.

**HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGES**

*   Cerner
*   athenahealth
*   commonwell HEALTH ALLIANCE
*   eHealth Exchange

**SOLSTICE CLINICAL PIPELINE**

**INDIVIDUAL PROVIDERS**
*   Regional Hospitals
*   Academic Hospitals
*   Regional Clinics
*   Surgical Centers
*   Physician Practices
*   Independent Labs
*   Imaging Centers
*   Physician Networks

Cumulatively access to **92%** of all US health organizations:
*   **27K+ PROVIDER GROUPS**
*   **3.1K HOSPITAL SYSTEMS**

To providers not accessible through EHRs, HINs¹, and exchanges:
*   **AUTOMATED FAX TRANSMISSION**
*   **CONTINUOUS FOLLOW-UPS**

## Slide 5: Product: Filtering
Product: Filtering
We filter through thousands of digital and machine-readable documents to find what matters for physicians.

Robust selection criteria established through 1000s of validated reports by physicians, using identifiers such as:
*   CLINICAL KEYWORDS
*   TYPE OF APPOINTMENT
*   TIMESTAMPS
*   TEST RESULTS
*   PROVIDER NAME
*   TYPE OF DOCUMENT

**1 Diagnosis-specific & customizable**
EXAMPLES:
*   **Breast Cancer:** Mammograms, CT
*   **Lung Cancer:** CT, MRI
*   **Hematology:** Blood tests

**2 Structured and unstructured information filtering**
*   **Input Formats:** XML, JSON, PDF
*   **Output Categories:**
    *   **Structured:** Labs, Medications, Diagnoses
    *   **Unstructured:** Progress Notes, Operative Notes

## Slide 6: Product: Structuring
Product: Structuring
We transform clinical documents into standardized formats.

Information from HIEs, EHRs, and individual providers arrives in many different formats...
*   Difficult for admin staff to decipher
*   Difficult for clinician to interpret

**Input Data Sources:**
*   HIE data
*   EHR data
*   Fax data

Using pre-trained LLMs, Solstice takes heterogenous data to transform it into uniformly structured data formats.

**Structured Data Formats:**
*   LABS & BLOOD TESTS
*   PATHOLOGY REPORTS
*   IMAGING REPORTS
*   PROGRESS NOTES
*   GENETIC PANELS

## Slide 10: Why Now?
Why Now?
Growing HIE adoption and LLM sophistication makes this business possible now.

**1 HIE Adoption Growing**
53% adoption rate in 2019 – 92% adoption rate in 2023

**2 LLM Sophistication**
Enhances the ability to process and structure large amounts of information

HYPOTHESIS:
These two macro trends will make automating the records retrieval process for community practices economical.

## Slide 11: Vision
Vision
Painting a comprehensive view of a patient's history for both providers and biopharma.

85% of specialty patients are treated in the community setting.

Retrieving entire medical histories for these patients creates the opportunity to create the first fully-comprehensive, linked dataset for oncology and other specialties.

GLOBAL REAL WORLD EVIDENCE MARKET¹: $15.6bn

Applications of RWD range from drug discovery, clinical trial matching, & post-market approval.
