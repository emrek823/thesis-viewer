### Mango Loop / Bobby Background

- Bobby’s career investor with 10x oversubscribed fund three raising $300M
- Family emigrated from Philippines, built semiconductor business from bootstrap to $3B wealth
- Taking $1B from $3B family wealth to establish Mango Loop
- Strategy: PE, VC, direct co-investments, 10-40M check sizes
- Focus on emerging managers, small funds, creative deals
- Less venture than at Ninja - targeting best of best venture only
- 5 commitments made since unofficial start in late August
- $90M committed to date, targeting next $20M for $110M this year
- General and tech-oriented strategy

### Virtue Fund One Performance & Portfolio Movement

- Finished new investments from Fund 1 in April 2025 after full 4-year investment period
- Strong Q4 2025 performance with 4-5 Fund 1 companies raising competitive rounds
- Key portfolio highlights:
	- Translucent: Led seed in March, 5x step-up to $27M Series A with GV in 6 months
	- Prudenta: Pre-seed to competitive Series A with multiple term sheets
	- 32 Health: Sonic convertible with strategic partner
	- Anna: 21-22% ownership, $17.5M term sheet with Transformation Capital
	- SmartIEx: 3 years from $14.3M pre to $1.1B acquisition (returning 2/3 to 3/4 of fund alone)
- Write-downs: Hero Journey Club marked to zero, Clear and Echo underperforming
- One Series A graduation miss: Tuva (still operating with $3M+ revenue but struggled with AI transition)
- Overall: 90%+ Series A graduation rate, expecting 3-5x fund return, potentially north of 5x

### Fund Two Strategy Evolution

- 4 companies invested, only institutional investor in 2 of 4 deals
- AI-native approach now required across all investments
- Higher bar for care delivery investments due to Series A/B market constraints
- Focus on multi-billion dollar outcome potential with efficient capital paths
- Strategy remains sector and stage focused but more concentrated approach

### GPV Merger Consideration

- Andrew Perlman at GPV proposing merger to create new combined entity
- GPV: $1.6B AUM, healthcare/enterprise split, stepping into emeritus positions
- Proposed structure:
	- Early stage fund: $200-250M (combining GPV’s $150M + Virtue’s funds)
	- Later stage growth and opportunity fund
	- Incubation fund (already raised)
- Virtue would be go-forward brand, equal partnership structure
- Would jump from $100M to $400-500M AUM overnight
- Includes 20+ health system partnerships (Kaiser, UPMC, Intermountain) for portfolio de-risking
- Concerns: One-way door decision, unknown unknowns, potential negative signaling
- Formal docs expected within 24 hours

### Alternative Parallel Fund Strategy with Mango Loop

- Middle path option: Add $20-30M parallel fund to current $55M Fund 2
- Same investment strategy, no changes to portfolio construction
- Enables larger position sizes (additional 0.5-1.5M per investment = 5% more ownership)
- Allows preemptive rounds without SPV complications
- More concentrated approach with better reserve strategy (20% reserves in 10-20% of positions vs 45% of positions)
- Potential to employ proven doubling/tripling down strategy from pre-Virtue days

### Investment Opportunity & Market Timing

- Incredible early-stage healthcare opportunity larger than anticipated 4 years ago
- Limited viable standalone digital health competition (Meridian Street, potentially others)
- AI transition creating wide-open market with high signal-to-noise challenges
- Healthcare software stack replacement cycle creating aggressive investment window
- Founders consistently providing positive feedback on Virtue’s market position

### Process & Terms Discussion

- Minimum $20M commitment, potential flexibility up to $30M
- Blended 2 and 20 carry structure (2.5% stepping down, 20% carry escalating to 25% at 4x)
- Side letter terms:
	- Pro rata rights in future funds
	- MFN up to check size
	- LPAC seat across vehicles
- ODD process: $10K third-party consultative review covering cash/wire controls, cybersecurity
- Background checks can leverage existing Sedana work to avoid duplication

### Next Steps

- Memo completion targeted for this week/early next week
- Reference calls completion by Thursday
- Bobby review and family discussion
- Parallel legal review without LPA changes given situation
- Target closing before end of year to inform 2026 strategy and tactics
- GPV formal documentation review happening simultaneously
- Decision timeline accelerated due to GPV opportunity pressure
