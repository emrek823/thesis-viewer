RightSite Investor Update.2024.04.11 Confidential

Company Update - Q1 Highlights

The seed extension financing strategy set out to prove that health plans would sign shared savings contracts that generate  significant gross margin and cash flow. The strategy also called for modulating EMS call volume growth until a community's  blended case rate ("BCR") of payor contracts was above our cost-per-call (a proxy for Cost of Care).

With that framework in mind, here's how we did for Q1 2024:

Revenue Update - Health Plan Sales

● Performance: Our Q1 target was a BCR (Blended Case Rate) of $250 in Georgia. We closed the quarter at $136 in  GA, an increase of $49 from the beginning of the quarter, but short of our goal due to timing issues with Payors (see  below.)

● Payor Pipeline Activity: The payor pipeline advanced across the board, with 5 new FFS contracts (GA, TX, FL) and 1  new case rate (GA) signed. We are deep in the final contracting stage with 1 FFS (United-GA all LOBs) and 3 case  rate negotiations (Humana, CareSource and Aetna) that did not close in Q1. We have line of site to close the  following contracts in Q2:

○ Humana Case Rate adds ~ $48

○ CareSource Case Rate adds ~ $24

○ Aetna Case Rate adds ~ $40

○ United FFS adds ~ $21

○ Total additional BCR of these deals = 48+24+40+21=$133 or $269 GA BCR

● External Factors: Our case rate sales process encountered two bottlenecks. First, negotiations with three plans -  Humana, CareSource, and Aetna - moved from state-based teams to their enterprise teams. The good news is that  when closed, these will be enterprise-wide contracts—the bad news is that the enterprise sales process is slower.  Second, executive turnover at Humana and United has lengthened their decision-making time. For example, at  Humana, we've worked through three different Southeast region plan presidents and a reorganization in value-based  contracting since August ‘23. At United, five of their senior leadership positions turned over last quarter. Despite the  longer sales cycle, solid execution of our sales process ensured deep and wide relationships and helped us weather  these challenges without pipeline degradation.

Company Update - Q1 Highlights

● FFS Sales Process Improvement: Our FFS sales process improved as we are completing the final physician  credentialing in the arcane state-based Medicare, Medicaid, and DEA applications in our core states. Adding a  dedicated person to address all credentialing and FFS-related activity resulted in faster provider contract  submissions through standard provider/payor channels. For example, the Centene Texas FFS provider contract was  recently executed for all LOBs (Medicare, Medicaid, and Exchange) in under a month.

● Revenue Cycle Management: As we mature our revenue cycle process, Cindy Buckles pivoted from a sales support  role to lead our RCM efforts. She brings 25 years of payor and provider contracting experience (BCBS-TN), where  she helped design and implement TennCare, and then 5 years working with providers to negotiate payor contracts.  Her background has assisted us with the physician, state, and payor licensing, credentialing, enrollment, and patient  insurance discovery and verification. She will transition her payor sales efforts throughout Q2 and continue to be a  payor SME to the payor sales team.

● Expansion in Sales Team: We've decided to hire a payor sales rep this quarter to support Clayton. The profile will be  expertise in executing provider-payor sales contracts, specifically value-based and quality measure arrangements. A  successful hire will generate meaningful BCRs in our target communities. Clayton consulted with Lauren Heller at  NVP as we launched this search.

● EMS Sales Expansion: The sales team has taken the lead in managing the sales process for EMS expansion.  Leveraging Clayton's process expertise and Jared's (see slide 5) SME-level understanding of EMS decision-making,  we now have a better EMS sales process.

Company Update - Q1 Highlights

Cost of Care Update - Care Team

Our Care Team oversees patient care episodes. This interdisciplinary team of doctors and lay navigators addresses both  clinical and non-clinical needs throughout each episode. With thousands of episodes now under our belt, we see many  ways to improve the workflow and collaboration between navigators and physicians, translating into better episode  outcomes that require less time. Examples of ways to use technology (like RightSite Connect and pVerify) or improved  processes include:

● Better and faster patient insurance identification

● Streamlining and automating documentation

● Automating tasks like identifying and contacting clinical and non-clinical resources

● Implementing rules-based pathways in our platform for managing specific episode types

This quarter, we will test the implementation of community health worker capabilities within the Care Team, which could  generate better outcomes and additional revenue.

We are carefully balancing efforts to reduce episode costs with our commitment to delivering empathic services that our  patients and EMS partners value.

The RightSite Foundation - an Offset to Cost of Care

Work with the RightSite Foundation continues to accelerate. We think about the Foundation as the "payor" for services  provided to the uninsured (transportation, urgent care appointments, prescriptions, DME) and, as such, a meaningful  contributor to decreasing the Cost of Care. We are talking to a few philanthropies who are helping us shape the program  from an IRS compliance perspective, and positioning to attract community-based philanthropies who are prospects for  the Foundation. Q2’s goal is to finish building the Foundation's MVP technology/software infrastructure and hire its  Director, who we've already identified. There's a budding conversation with one philanthropy that might fund all the  Foundation startup costs, and we're working on that now, although the outcome is still uncertain.

Company Update - Q1 Highlights

Call Volume Update - EMS

The call volume for the quarter decreased by 36%. This reduction wasn't due to a decline in our service quality or  fluctuations experienced by our EMS agencies. Instead, the volume drop was an expected consequence of our  decreased engagement as a way to modulate call volume. We eased up on our EMS account management, and as a  result, they called less often.

With pain comes gain - this decrease in volume prompted us to make two crucial decisions. First, we found and hired an  EMS leader. Jared Oscarson, a former EMS Chief and SVP of Operations for Ready Responders, joined us as a full-time  consultant. The plan is for him to join our leadership team this quarter. Secondly, we are rolling out our change  management/ADKAR-based strategic account plan process for all EMS partners over Q2. This framework allows for a  more precise "diagnosis and treatment" of call volume, while setting baseline and forecast call volume goals.

In Q2, a significant development will be the activation of Grady's dispatch center, complementing the volume from  Grady's field operations. The potential volume from Grady Dispatch could reach 20-40 calls/day once fully implemented,  our BCR > $250, and the Care Team staffs up. We're noticing a growing trend among EMS agencies requesting our  assistance in dispatch operations alongside their field activities, as it allows for a broader coverage for their  non-emergent calls. From RightSite's perspective, dispatch implementations involve less change management effort  since the call volume from dispatch is generated algorithmically rather than relying on EMS medic judgment on scene.

Confidential 5

Company Update - Q1 Highlights

Revenue Cycle Update

Our revenue cycle process is both straightforward and intricate. On the straightforward side, we're submitting just a few  FFS codes (99203/4/5) and case rates that should be auto-adjudicated with a HCPCS code. On the intricate side, there  are two challenges. First, navigating credentialing within our CPOM entity involves securing approvals at the state and  physician levels for Medicare, Medicaid, and DEA. Second, identifying patient insurance in an on-demand, virtual, and  911 environment is hard.

We've submitted 227 FFS claims (MA, Medicare, Mgd Medicaid and Medicaid) to our billing company with an allowable  amount of $42,998. Additionally, 133 FFS claims with an allowable amount of $21,757 are prepared for submission as  Change Healthcare comes back online.

The billing delay caused by Change Healthcare set us back about four weeks. Additionally, we're awaiting actual effective  dates from several payors, and once received, we will file their claims.

Finance Update

We closed the oversubscribed Friends & Family tranche, raising the seed extension to $6.0MM. Our operational outflows,  excluding one-time expenses like medical malpractice renewals, remained steady, with a monthly burn rate of $450K.  However, this rate will decrease significantly over this year as payor contracting, Cost of Care efficiencies, and revenue  cycle processes yield results. As of the end of March, we have about $5.5MM in cash.

Confidential 6

Company Update - Q1 Highlights

Goals for Q2

We are continuing our Q1 Company Priorities into Q2, with one change - we are now actively engaging EMS in all markets to  promote call volume. Q2 Priorities include these three key objectives:

1. Revenue Generation: Our focus remains increasing blended case rates (BCRs) in GA, TX, and FL to exceed our cost per  call and generate healthy gross margins.

2. Cost Optimization: Continue to improve Care Team processes and the RightSite Connect platform to reduce episode cost  of care.

3. Call Volume Growth: Stimulate growth in EMS call volume with our change management/ADKAR-based EMS strategic  account management plans. Also, pursue dispatch implementations.

These three components together define our unit economics, conceptually represented by the formula: (BCR - Cost of Care) x Call Volume = Gross Margin ➤ Cash Flow

○ BCR increases with payor FFS and case rate contracts and the Foundation’s offsetting contribution for uninsured  care

○ Cost of Care decreases with tech-enabled process efficiencies of the Care Team episodes

○ Call Volume increases with EMS agency growth, dispatch implementations, and our ADKAR account management  processes

Our future financing strategies become more evident as we successfully deliver on these three components.
