## Slide 5: Andrew's journey: a surgery more complicated than planned resulted in reimbursement complication

**TriBridge**

**(Image: Portrait of Andrew, MD, Pediatric Surgeon, with the Seattle Children's Hospital logo.)**

**Andrew, MD, Pediatric Surgeon**
**Seattle Children's HOSPITAL • RESEARCH • FOUNDATION**

**Andrew and SCH’s journey:**

*   Prior to a recent surgery, Seattle Children's Hospital (SCH) submitted a prior authorization request to Cigna and received approval to render the requested care and a commitment to be reimbursed $2,000 for the procedure
*   Andrew recently conducted the procedure, supported by a team of staff and an anesthesiologist. During the procedure, several necessary treatments not included in the prior auth were rendered due to a miscommunication between Andrew and the billing staff
*   As a result, the claim for reimbursement sent by SCH to Cigna included several line items not included in the original prior authorization.
*   Cigna approved and paid the prior-authorized portion of the claim, denied several other items, and reimbursed other items at a partial level. SCH requested to be paid $3,500 above the original authorization, but after reviewing the claim, Cigna only agreed to pay $2,900 additional.
*   However, when the payment arrived, it was only for $2,815, due to adjustments made by Cigna to the payment to account for other, unrelated value-based care arrangements.
*   As a result, SCH staff spent several hours working with Cigna to understand what they had been paid and why.

“TriBridge could eliminate multiple points of cost and friction in the system. I’m very excited about this.”

## Slide 6: Debra's journey: a simple encounter results in administrative waste

**TriBridge**

**(Image: Portrait of Debra, MD, Family Practitioner, with The Family Medical Center logo.)**

**Debra, MD, Family Practitioner**
**THE FAMILY MEDICAL CENTER**
**RAPID. RELIABLE. RESPECTED.**

**Debra and Family Medical's journey:**

*   Debra had a standard office visit with a long-time patient. Everything was coded correctly in the EHR and billed to the payor, Cigna.
*   Two weeks later, R1 (the outsourced RCM provider for Family Medical) received a payment from Cigna. But the provided 835 (remittance advice) did not include the correct “Trace number” that allows R1 to match this file to the correct claim. As a result, the RCM team could not properly post the payment, because it wasn't clear what claim(s) it matched with.
*   Because of the confusion, someone from R1 called Cigna and spent 30 minutes on hold waiting for a human to pick up. Once they were on the call together, it took 8 minutes to resolve the questions on the claim.

“This is super-inspiring. It's the first thing we've seen that truly revolutionizes the payment industry in US Healthcare”.

## Slide 7: Vicki's journey: minimizing provider abrasion while ensuring payment integrity

**TriBridge**

**(Image: Portrait of Vicki, Dir. Provider Services, with the Cigna logo.)**

**Vicki Dir. Provider Services**
**Cigna**

**Vicki's journey:**

*   Vicki's provider servicing team does not handle claims adjudication. However, when providers feel that claims weren't paid accurately, or don't understand a payment, they come to her team and are often frustrated.
*   Nearly a quarter of the inbound volume to the provider call center is regarding payment inquiries – with over half of those just trying to understand what was paid and why it might be different from the claim.
*   Sometimes the inbound calls are clinical disputes, e.g., about the medical necessity of procedures. But often the calls result from administrative issues: data errors, mismatched payments and remittance advice, or delays due to internal inefficiencies
*   To reduce provider abrasion, Vicki's call center is staffed with a large team of well-trained FTEs who aim to minimize provider hold time. As a result, the call center is one of the faster growing opex drivers at Cigna

“TriBriddge would be great for many of our smaller providers – they would benefit, and it would help our relationship with them. We are always on the lookout for things that reduce provider abrasion in our dealings.”
**Stacy, Controller and Strategic Finance, Cambia, operator of Blue Plans in 5 states**

“Every payer strategy project I've done for payers for 4 years includes something around provider satisfaction. TriBridge gets providers to submit fewer times (and more often correct); and allows payers to simplify the steps needed to pay"
**Tony Juryk, Partner, Payer/Provider Practice Deloitte**

*Confidential*
7

## Slide 8: Root cause of reconciliation issues: Following claims adjudication, payors send funds and remittance advice via separate rails to providers, who are challenged to reassociate and reconcile

**TriBridge**

**(Diagram illustrating the current payment and remittance advice process)**

**Remittance Advice rail:**
*   **ERA (835)** -> **Clearinghouse** -> **ERA Received** -> **Providers** (ERA distributed to Physical Therapy A/R, Outpatient ASC A/R, Hospital A/R)
*   Consolidated payment reports sent via claims clearinghouses

**Payment rail:**
*   **Payors** -> **Payments sent via financial system** -> **EFT** -> **Financial institution** -> **Funds Received** -> **Providers** (Funds allocated to Physical Therapy A/R, Outpatient ASC A/R, Hospital A/R)
*   Providers often then further allocate payments to subsidiary business units / doctors / accounting systems

**Providers face many challenges in reassociating these two data streams (EFT/ERA) back together, driving labor-intensive reconciliation and calls; key drivers include:**

*   **Batching:** Hundreds of claims are batched together per transmission and providers can't predict which claims will be included in any given batch
*   **Timing:** EFTs and ERAs may not arrive at the same time, and may not match 1:1 in terms of what's included in each
*   **Errors:** Data errors are often introduced along the way, preventing automated matching
*   **Constraints:** ACH protocol constraints, such as an 80-character limit, prevent transparency in data transmissions
*   **Misunderstandings:** Provider systems often have a complex grouping of NPIs and TINs, leading to confusion in how payments should be routed

*Confidential*
**EFT = Electronic Funds Transfer; ERA = Electronic Remittance Advice (typically leveraging the 835 standard template)**
8

## Slide 9: These reconciliation issues occur across trillions of payment flows and billions of claims per year - driving significant pain to both payors and providers

**TriBridge**

### Key Pain Points for both Payors and Providers

**(Left side data points)**

*   **US healthcare spend per year:** $4T+
*   **Claims filed and adjudicated per year:** 9.5 B

**(Right side key pain points)**

*   **Time-consuming:** Weeks or even months between claim submission and remittance
*   **Costly:** Managing claims flows requires costly technology and service infrastructure to support
*   **Wasteful:** Billions are spent annually on claims status inquiries, disputes, and reconciling expected vs. actual payments
*   **Antiquated:** Most payments are made using legacy and / or inefficient protocols (traditional ACH or even paper check)
*   **Abrasive:** These challenges lead to patient billing issues, a major cause of low NPS and Stars scores, impacting profitability

## Slide 10: TriBridge is an integrated money and data network sitting between payors and providers with two linked products: Unify and Accelerate

**TriBridge**

**(Diagram showing Payors and Providers connected by TriBridge, with two arrows indicating Unify and Accelerate functions.)**

*   **Payors** (building icon) -> (TriBridge logo) -> **Providers** (medical professional icon)
*   **A. Unify** (arrow from Payors to TriBridge)
*   **B. Accelerate** (arrow from TriBridge to Providers, with a clock icon)

**Solution Components**

### Unified financial and data rails that: (Unify)
*   streamline payment flows from payor to provider
*   enable faster and more automated cash reconciliation
*   offer denial / adjustment insights

### AI-driven prediction engine to: (Accelerate)
*   initiate and deliver claims payments within 24 hours of submission for up to 90% of claims (with no capital risk)

**Benefits**

### Unify Benefits:
*   Accelerates transition to electronic payments (lower-cost vs checks)
*   Reduced cost of money movement across the ecosystem
*   Significant provider labor cost savings for cash reconciliation
*   Significant call center savings for both payors and providers via reduced call volume on payment inquiries

### Accelerate Benefits:
*   Acceleration of working capital for providers by 14-90 days
*   Significant savings to payors on prompt payment penalties
*   Improves payors' return on assets for float above what today's claims reserves return

*Confidential*

## Slide 11: A TriBridge Unify harmonizes disparate data flows – and generates powerful reporting functionality for Providers / RCMs to reconcile money flows

**TriBridge**

**(Diagram illustrating the Unify process)**

*   **Payors** (building icon)
    *   `Unify Data Input` (orange arrow) -> **TriBridge Unify** (TriBridge logo with "Unify" below it)
    *   `Unify Payment Input` (blue arrow) -> **TriBridge Unify**
*   From **TriBridge Unify**: `Unify Reconciliation Manager` (blue arrow) -> **Provider RCM** (In-House or Outsourced) (medical professional icon)

**Unify Data Input:** A connection enabling the ingestion of Payer 835 / ERA information (via the same interfaces used today for clearinghouses).

**Unify Payment Input:** An automated payment interface enabling payers to initiate TriBridge payments via existing and / or provider specified payment channels (leveraging existing payment processes)

**Unify Reconciliation Manager:** an API and dashboard-accessible reporting platform enabling providers and RCM employees to automatically match payment and ERAs, identify data discrepancies / errors, and highlight other potential issues, enabling:
(a) Increased rate of automated reconciliation and cash posting (saves manual reconciliation labor from frequent reconciliation errors today)
(b) Reduced need for claims payment inquiries / disputes (often involving manual calls between providers and payors)
(c) Better focused revenue cycle management resources on highest value opportunities

*Confidential*

## Slide 12: B TriBridge Accelerate enables acceleration of claims payments to providers to within 24 hours of claim submission, without taking capital risk

**TriBridge**

**(Diagram illustrating the Accelerate process)**

*   **Payors** (building icon) -> (long orange arrow, representing funds flow through TriBridge Accelerate) -> **Providers** (medical professional icon)
*   **TriBridge Accelerate** (TriBridge logo with "Accelerate" and a clock icon) is in the middle of the flow.

**How TriBridge Accelerate Works:**

### Superior Dataset
*   Over time, the TriBridge Health Payments Network will amass a significant dataset on what claims are paid at what level across payor / provider / member plan combinations

### Predictive Intelligence
*   Running analytics on this dataset, we can predict which incoming claims will be paid between payor / provider pairs with a high degree of confidence – without having to replicate payor claim adjudication systems or rules.

### 24-Hour Provisional Payment of Many Claims
*   We can accelerate the payment of these claims to “next day” by pulling funds from the Payor and sending them to the Provider – notifying in our Unify reporting that this is an advance payment still subject to formal payor adjudication.
*   Providers would pay for early access to these funds, enabling compensation to Payors for the "cost of funds” of reducing their float
*   TriBridge takes **no capital risk**, and each side of the network maintains their existing processes

### Subsequent Reconciliation
*   When payors ultimately adjudicate their claims, we can leverage our payment and reporting capabilities to adjust payment amounts for claims that are adjusted, if required. E.g.:
    *   A $200 payment for a procedure that is ultimately paid at $200: no change in payments, reflects within TriBridge reporting tool
    *   A $500 payment for a series of tests that ultimately gets paid at $350: TriBridge would withhold $150 from the next payment to that provider

## Slide 13: The TriBridge solutions creates value for all players in the ecosystem

**TriBridge**

### Providers (medical professional icon)
*   Accelerate funds receipt from 14+ days to < 24 hours
*   Reduce cost and complexity of post-claim payment reconciliation
*   Improve cashflow forecasting and increase working capital
*   *Details to follow*

### Payors (building icon)
*   Reduce costs of electronic payment
*   Reduce need for paper checks
*   Improve ability to pay claims quickly
*   Reduce administrative burden from provider dispute management
*   Improve overall provider experience
*   Improve patient satisfaction, positively impacting STARS ratings
*   Reduction in prompt pay penalties

### Patients (person with sling icon)
*   Simplify patient billing experience by reducing errors
*   Drive down overall cost of healthcare administration, decreasing patient costs (indirectly)

*Confidential*

## Slide 14: How TriBridge Makes Money

**TriBridge**

**(Image of Unify arrow and Accelerate clock icon)**

### Unify
**1. Payments:** We charge payors for processing the payments – at similar rates to what they pay existing bank providers today
**2. SaaS Revenue:** We charge providers for access to the Unify Reconciliation Manager on a SaaS basis

**Note:** we can process payments at lower cost than payors can today via an aggregation process called “net settlement,” which will drive significant margin as our network of payers and providers grows

### Accelerate
**Spread Revenue:**
**1.** We charge providers a percent of claim dollars accelerated
**2.** We pay a portion of this back to payors (roughly equivalent to T-bill rates for approximate time accelerated) to make up for payors' loss of interest on their float

We can do this because there is a difference in the cost of capital for providers vs payors, and we can arbitrage this spread as a revenue opportunity.

## Slide 16: Where does TriBridge sit in the healthcare payments ecosystem?

**TriBridge**

### Potential Competitors

#### Healthcare Payments Companies

*   **Zelis®**
    *   A healthcare payments company who predominantly uses existing credit card and virtual card solutions to help payors / providers move from paper checks to electronic payments
    *   Virtual cards have a ~3% merchant fee to providers – which they have significant issues with given their low profitability
*   **InstaMed** (a J.P.Morgan company)
    *   A healthcare payments company who predominantly supports providers to collect funds from patients, allowing multiple electronic payment methods
    *   Doesn't address payor / provider payment or reconciliation challenges

### Channel partners / players

#### Clearinghouses

*   **CHANGE HEALTHCARE**
    *   A clearinghouse that receives claims from providers and passes them to payors, then receives ERA's from payors and routes them back to providers.
    *   After their acquisition by Optum / United Healthcare, many providers are reluctant to work with them given concerns about UHC / Optum driving down their margins

#### Revenue Cycle Managers

*   **WAYSTAR**
*   **R1.**
*   **athenahealth**
    *   Firms providing tools and/or outsourced RCM process capabilities to providers to help with full-cycle RCM activities
    *   Are more likely to be customers / channel partners of TriBridge, as our solutions will help them deliver their RCM services more cost effectively to their clients.

*Confidential*
16

## Slide 17: So why hasn't this been done before?

**TriBridge**

| Challenges | Why TriBridge Can Succeed |
| :-------- | :------------------------ |
| **1.** Payment mechanisms require scale and connectivity across the financial system | With payment partner network, we have day-one connectivity across the entire US banking ecosystem |
| **2.** Lack of trust between payors and providers – all current intermediaries are aligned to payors or providers | We are an unbiased, trusted third party not aligned to any stakeholder |
| **3.** Regulatory hurdles in health tech and fintech create major barriers to players on either side building solutions in the other | We marry expertise in both – and leverage modern partnerships to enable compliance |
| **4.** Claims processing is incredibly complex – many players have tried to change claim processing | We focus on money movement, not changing claims processing |
| **5.** Other efforts required changes to existing processes / systems | Our solution requires minimal process changes; we just need copies of 835s/ERAs/SPRs that are easily available from payor systems |

*Confidential*
17

## Slide 18: Target corporate structure – broad ecosystem participation on cap table, while maintaining neutrality between payors & providers

**TriBridge**

### Target Cap Table

#### Lead Financial Investor
*   **Top Tier HC VC or PE**
    *   1-2 well-connected growth-oriented VC funds to lead each funding round to:
        *   Determine round pricing / term (facilitating most payor / provider CVC's to participate as non-lead investors)
        *   Maintain neutrality focus in governance
        *   Provide growth support through their network and expertise (talent, BD, strategic insight)

#### Ecosystem Participation
*   **1-2 Providers**
*   **1-2 Payors**
    *   Similar to Visa's original formation – where large network-affiliated banks were also shareholders – we will look for early payor / provider adopters to invest as minority shareholders
        *   Stakes for each group (providers, payors) will stay relatively similar to ensure TriBridge neutrality
        *   Aligns incentives of early network participants to grow volumes on network, recruit more ecosystem players to TriBridge network

#### Technology Development
*   **HC Focused Systems Integrator**
*   **Hyperscaler**
    *   We are pursuing additional strategic technology partnerships that may extend to shareholdings, including:
        *   Large Healthcare SI – strategic partnership around accelerated MVP development, integration into their existing RCM and Payor BPO efforts
        *   Hyperscaler partnership to extend beyond cloud hosting / tools to strategic development, AI integration, go-to-market efforts

#### Money Movement
*   **Visa (or other money movement partner)**
    *   We are exploring with Visa an investment to close with the Series A funding terms
        *   Minority (<19.9%), non-controlling stake
        *   No preferential acquisition rights / ROFRs for Visa that would dissuade other investors
        *   Arms length commercial terms for any services they would provide to TriBridge

*Confidential*
18

## Slide 19: Our goal is to raise $5M by April 30 – to support these milestones
