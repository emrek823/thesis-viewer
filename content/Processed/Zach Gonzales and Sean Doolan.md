### Zach’s Independent Sponsor Strategy

- Building concentrated growth equity fund targeting 2-10M EBITDA healthcare companies
- Hands-on operational approach for unsophisticated businesses overlooked by PE
- Initial plan: 2-3 deals independently, then raise 150-200M closed-end fund
	- 7-10 deal fund, median 25M investment
	- Minority deals: 5-20M | Majority deals: 10-40M
	- 1-2 deals at 15-20% fund allocation for concentration
- Pipeline includes 11M EBITDA dental business (Southern CA) and 15M run-rate infusion services company

### Market Opportunity & Positioning

- Average PE fund doubled in size over 10-12 years, DPI down 30% (2x to 1.4x)
- Large funds chasing same 15M EBITDA businesses, driving up valuations
- Strategy: build smaller businesses to sell to larger PE funds
- Graduation rates from Series A still low at ~15% (vs 40-60% in 2020-21)
	- Good healthcare companies can’t raise Series B/C despite solid growth
	- Venture appetite focused on AI-native software only
- Fund size discipline critical - won’t exceed ~250M to maintain nimble approach

### Capital Raising Progress

- Targeting independent sponsor/one-off investors initially
- Meeting with Industry Ventures, Ocean Avenue Capital, family offices
- Story evolution: thesis-driven, concentrated approach in overlooked segment
- LP composition preference: <10% strategics to avoid conflicts
	- Current Virtue LPs include Sendana Capital (emerging manager focus), Industry Ventures
	- Sendana anchored early funds like Roger Ehrenberg (IA), Forerunner, Mucker

### Next Steps

- Sean to share blurb with family offices writing 5-20M checks
- Green light for introductions to interested investors
- Team building: seeking principal-level hire (2017-2019 graduate)
- Senior advisor discussions ongoing with former Norwest GP Ryan Harris
