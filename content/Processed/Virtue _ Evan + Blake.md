### Current Product Development

- Stage 0 of overall plan - skin to skin and volunteering with another patient in hospice
- Working with Woven: 100 employees and 50 clients; rough economics show companies with 5-7k clients sell for $100M in home health space
- Voice companion development timeline (1-3 months):
	- Amazon Astro implementation - 3-wheeled robot with simple motion capabilities that creates non-obvious engagement
	- Testing in May with client who has flat wood floor house; currently running true alpha
	- Interface components:
		- Speech to text conversion
		- Model integration with prompt engineering
		- Continuous feedback loop with memory capabilities (can reference past conversations)
		- Integration of Sesame and other voice models for human-like conversation

### Physical Robot Implementation (6-8 months)

- Connected with China supply chain contacts for robotic arm development
- Manufacturing partnerships developing through existing China robotics ecosystem
- Plan to leverage existing platforms rather than become hardware company
- Positioning as copilot alongside human caregivers provides more flexibility than consumer-focused solutions
- No clinical compliance or data security requirements simplifies development

### Breakthrough Features

Mini breakthrough with in-home transcription:

- Pilot group sends audio files that convert to extensive text (10,000+ words)
- System creates elegant summaries that:
	- Make staff feel recognized by highlighting their work
	- Help new staff ($20/hour aids) understand client preferences
	- Enable queries like “what has Marie been enjoying lately?”

### Client Adoption & Positioning

- 60% opt-in rate for recording/transcription
- Positioned as quality assurance solution
- Current implementation:
	- $60 DJI Bluetooth mic clipped to staff badges
	- Physical robot presence enhances interaction compared to phone-only solution
	- Focus on building presence in homes to enable care platform development

### Technical Strategy

- Vision-first approach:
	- NERF field technology enables 3D scene construction from single images
	- Similar to FSD (Full Self-Driving) data collection model
	- Combining video training data with intent recognition
- Example use case: Understanding context (e.g., half-full water glass scenario requires understanding both visual and social context)
- Development focus:
	- Breaking into Amazon developer program for API access
	- Leveraging Chinese robotics platforms and supply chain
	- Building on existing LLM platforms rather than developing new ones

### Strategic Direction

- Planning to raise pre-seed funding in near future
- Focus on building “SoftBank story” over next 6-9 months
- Emphasizing robot-human interface expertise while leveraging existing platforms
- Not attempting to replace physical labor in initial version
