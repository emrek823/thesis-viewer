# Healthcare - Chief Medical Officer at Carbon Health
Interview conducted on June 30, 2025

## Topics
Technology Integration, Billing, Voice AI, Integration Process, Tech Solutions, Healthcare, Patient Engagement, Urgent Care

## Summary
The Tegus Client and Carbon Health expert discussed the use of AI technology, specifically Hello Patient, for outbound engagement in billing and revenue cycle management. The decision to choose Hello Patient was based on product experience, understanding of healthcare workflows, and ease of integration. While ROI is not yet quantified, the technology has the potential to improve efficiency and collect revenue that would have been previously written off. The expert praised the product's early experience, high execution velocity, and the founder's product intuition, expressing confidence in working with the Hello Patient team again and potentially investing in the company.

## Client
Hello and thanks for your time today. I would like to learn about the healthcare space using voice for customer service, patient engagement, scheduling, things like that. That's the context for this call today. To get started, maybe just to hear about your role and responsibilities today?

## Expert
Sure. I'm the chief medical officer at Carbon Health. I don't know if you're familiar with the company, but we're a health tech company that is a technology provider enablement platform. We have our own clinics that we support. We have 93 clinics that provide services in urgent care, primary care, behavioral health, some workplace health, as well as clinical research. We also provide and support probably about 25 other external practices or locations as well.

## Client
Excellent. Just so I'm understanding the current state of your technology, are you using any AI customer service or AI voice for scheduling tools, anything of that nature?

## Expert
Yeah. I probably should have made it more clear. We are a technology company. We actually have been using AI integrated into our proprietary tools for the last three to four years, and we use it in a lot of different ways. We've also worked with external vendors and in select cases we integrate those capabilities into our platform as well. I'm pretty experienced with the solutions that are out on the market just from evaluating them and basically making a decision about whether we would build or buy.

## Client
You mentioned you've used some of the third-party vendors. Could you name a couple of those? Specifically, any early stage start-ups that would be helpful as well.

## Expert
The one that we have, actually completed integration is Hello Patient. They have voice capabilities that help us with outbound. Where we're focusing it is mostly around augmenting our service support in the billing and RCM side of things more than for scheduling. We just happen to have really good scheduling tools, and most of our patients have adopted those. We just haven't had the same need or urgency around implementing voice AI tools into the scheduling. I'm certainly familiar with the other options that are out there, if that makes sense.

## Client
I'd love to spend a few minutes talking about Hello Patient. I know you mentioned billing and RCM side of things. Could you just describe in as much detail as possible, the use cases you're using Hello Patient for?

## Expert
I'll revert back to what I was saying. Because we have pretty well-designed consumer-facing tools interactions for what patients need and what the practice needs to support, a lot of our interactions are simply done digitally. What we have found is that there's still a longer tail of patient customers that are out there.

For example, if we have patients who didn't pay their bill automatically or we have some issue with their credit card on file, and we're trying to reengage with them to be able to get those bills closed, that's the primary target for where we're using Hello Patient.

## Client
Just getting those bills closed, could you walk me through what that workflow looks like? Is it a patient or a customer calls, they say, "I need to pay this bill," and Hello Patient automatically recognizes they need to pay a bill and asks for credit card information, or how does that work?

## Expert
We're using it more outbound. Hello Patient can now obviously do either, but we're more using it as an outbound engagement tool because these are, again, patients that have not been engaging. Similar how you see voice AI tools used for, like say, population health and engaging patients that way, we're using the same type of framework and applying it to the revenue cycle for outstanding AR. It does an outbound call and it

has awareness of that patient, their account, and helps to give them the options to be able to pay.

## Client
The options would be log into a portal or send a check in, or pay through the phone. Is that right?

## Expert
Yeah.

## Client
Can Hello Patient accept the payment information?

## Expert
No. It is giving a link so that they can complete the transaction.

## Client
It's essentially a bill reminder tool today. Does it integrate with your RCM, where you can set it up to say if this bill hasn't been paid in three weeks, whatever it may be, then outbound this patient and then follow up every four days after that?

## Expert
Yeah.

## Client
How easy was that integration process with your RCM?

## Expert
The founder is basically alum from Carbon Health, so the integration was not that difficult because the founder used to work within the product team. Here's what my experience has been in and outside of Carbon is that integration can mean lot of different things. The ease or difficulty of integration often comes down to the client side, is often the constraint depending on how sophisticated or structured their platform is, API, etc. Obviously, I'm not a doctor, I'm not the product guy, but I live in it enough. I see where the issues are.

## Client
How closely did you work with the Hello Patient team throughout this integration process?

## Expert
I wasn't necessarily involved in the technical integration. As part of the exec team and the CMO, I'm definitely involved in our service delivery. Here at Carbon, our service delivery is very integrated with technology. I'm involved in product and helping to shape strategic decisions, serve as a subject matter expert, but I'm not a technologist. I'm not in the technical integration itself.

## Client
Did you evaluate any other tools when you were going through the selection process for Hello Patient?

## Expert
When we finally made the decision, most of the other exploration we'd done just faded into the background. There were just enough advantages we saw with Hello Patient, including the ability to do a fast integration. We looked at a number of platforms out there, and we also debated whether we wanted to stand up the capability ourselves.

## Client
What did that decision look like? Why did you ultimately decide to go with Hello Patient instead of building it

in-house?

## Expert
It's more complex, just with everything. More complex than it seems from the surface. The way we've been building up our AI, IP, and expertise has been more behind the scenes and not as much in the patient interactions. We just felt it was more complementary. To be totally transparent, just the speed and bandwidth is what made the decision in the end, which I think is probably common for most outsourcing decisions.

## Client
Do you remember any of the other vendors that you looked at when you were evaluating Hello Patient?

## Expert
I know there was a discussion about Artera. I think we looked at maybe healow, I think it's called Genie. I know we also looked at Phreesia. This is a slight tangent, but I also have been exposed and had some discussions with a company called PopAi, and they have an interesting model.

They weren't going to be able to take care of the specific application we wanted, but what they had was an interesting model that was more behind the scenes, where it would be able to capture the audio from all phone calls and then extract structured data and other types of insights from the voice that could then be integrated into your workflows.

As an example, it might be that you have actual human staff that's interacting with a patient or customer on the phone. Let's say that they're doing outreach for the care gap closure. Those interactions would be monitored in a way where you could start to get signal of factors in success. You could also prompt the staff so that they could be set up for scripting and data that would make the call more successful. That's just one example.

## Client
What stood out about Hello Patient? What were the variables that ultimately made you go, "We are going to go with Hello Patient," instead of others?

## Expert
It comes down to the product experience. We made this decision, it was probably almost a year ago. Honestly, at the time, I don't need to tell you, the landscape is changing so rapidly. The early versions of the tools that were out there, there was a rush of people, at least this is my perspective, a rush of people who came to the market. The barrier to creating a tool was low, but there's a real barrier to actually creating tools that are effective and don't feel janky.

There were just a number of small start-ups, and honestly, I can't remember the name of most of them. From 30,000 ft, it would look like they had the functionality, but when you actually experience the product, you could tell that they just didn't have the insight of what the job to be done actually was, the context of healthcare, the complexity, and then not even touching on integration. If you don't have integration, you're just not going to be adding much value.

## Client
If I play those three things back, the first was user experience interface being a high-quality product. The second thing was deeply understanding the healthcare workflows. You could tell that it was built by people with healthcare experience because it solved the exact problem you have. The third was an easy integration process.

## Expert
Yeah, that's right. I think that the Hello Patient founding team had a distinct advantage. I mentioned we've been using AI for a long time, some of which was actually behind the scenes. We'd be processing audio

interactions and gaining insights from that. We actually were able to get a lot of granular detail about the problems and the issues. Therefore, they understood where to focus in on the solutions or the applications.

## Client
Excellent. First, how long have you been using Hello Patient?

## Expert
We went live, I think it was about three months ago.

## Client
It's a relatively short time, but still, have you been able to quantify ROI from Hello Patient being the amount of bills you've been able to collect or the number of administrative workers you may be able to pull back on the spend on administrative labor, or anything of that sort?

## Expert
Honestly, it is too early and I don't have the data that would be anything meaningful other than anecdotes right now.

## Client
Yeah, anecdotes would be okay. Even any rough estimate of ROI to get a sense that it would be valuable.

## Expert
Here's how I would put it. Every one of those dollars are dollars we probably would have written off in the past because most of our engagement and surface area with patients was digital. We did have obviously some workforce that was doing outreach or handling inbound, but they're vastly outnumbered, let me put it that way.

We're not obviously unusual in the industry. There are some organizations that will truly do it through brute force, especially like legacy systems, but that's extremely expensive and we're a startup and we also want to drive to efficiency, which is why we quickly pivoted to look into tech to solve that problem.

## Client
On ROI for your specific use case, how targeted is Hello Patient towards that specific use case, or is it a much broader platform and you guys just have to be using it for bill collection?

## Expert
I do not want you to think that they are such a focus point solution. I am not trying to advocate for them because I have no dog in that fight, but they have much broader capabilities. I think I had mentioned they do both inbound and outbound. They have more capabilities than what we are taking advantage of, certainly.

Honestly, it would just be very difficult for a startup to get traction if they had such a narrow scope. Also, once you make the investment for the integration capabilities, once you stand up the voice AI, it would be silly not to apply it to a lot of the other interactions that happen in healthcare because the reality is healthcare in 2025 still is mostly fax and phone calls.

## Client
Do you have a sense of your willingness to pay per outbound call?

## Expert
I'm probably not telling you anything you don't know, but I've noticed already that pricing is moving towards utilization rather than seats. I've seen some other pricing models where folks are trying to effectively price as an FTE or using of FTE as the point of reference. Most of what I've seen now, the base SaaS fees have gone down and it's leaned much more into utilization.

## Client
Based on your current contract, do you expect spend to increase over the next year?

## Expert
Yes and no. We're using it in such a targeted way, the addressable market internally for us is more around the exceptions or outliers, and we're also doing a lot of front-end optimization to reduce the need or to reduce outliers or exceptions. I think it will because we're growing but also we're doing so much process improvement and deploying tech at the front-end of things that the utilization may not be straight line with growth.

## Client
If you're going to give Hello Patient a product score on a scale of 1-10, one being hate and 10 being love, what product score would you give it and why?

## Expert
I would say I'm going to give it an eight right now because the early experience has been good. The voice interactions are natural, it's contextually aware and because it's got integration, it's actually really solving problems. There's some tech solutions that help or seemingly help solve a problem but end up not necessarily reducing the overall amount of work or labor spent, if that makes sense.

This is an example where it's solving a real problem that we had. It would be a very expensive problem if it were to solve it in a traditional way. Immediately out of the gate, they're able to help us with that in a way that aligns with our own service experience because that's something we take really seriously.

## Client
You reduced it by two points. What can they build or offer you to get those two points back?

## Expert
To be honest, it's because it's still early innings, I'm pretty skeptical as a physician. I think I'm wired that way. I just want to see more volume to stress test it to understand where the limits are because there will be obviously limits.

## Client
Do you have a sense of how many calls it is doing a month for you guys?

## Expert
I apologize because I probably should have pulled some of that. This was so high level what I was told the call was going to be about. I actually don't have that data for you. Just to give you a sense of scale though, we see 3,000 patients a day, so we see high volumes. All of our segments of patients are large because of that.

## Client
You said that they're solving outlier examples. Would you approximate that as 5% of the population or higher?

## Expert
5% is fair. I'm not going to overshare, but our outstanding AR has some lumpiness because we had some periods where we needed to increase resourcing. I think 5% is fair, but it may not be a run rate.

## Client
Have you heard of a company called Assort Health?

No, I haven't.

## Client
Did you work directly with the founder of Hello Patient or the Hello Patient employees that are founding engineers?

## Expert
Yeah, I have worked with the founding team.

## Client
How would you describe Alex?

## Expert
Alex has really good product intuition. I've been at Carbon long enough, I predated him. Alex came in and despite not having a lot of healthcare experience, he's somebody who was able to step in and actually grok what made my life difficult very quickly and understood the leverage points to help focus the product efforts.

As you know, it's a sinkhole, it's a black hole. If you don't focus on the right things, you could be off by five° and spend a lot of time and money. I think that's something that Alex is particularly talented in, and he also works well with others. There was a lot of cross functional work that Alex had to do. I think those are probably the biggest qualities I'd say that have helped him be successful.

## Client
If you're thinking about the Hello Patient team's execution velocity, on a scale of 1-10, one being, "Man, they haven't done anything," horrible, and 10 being they move at lightning speed, it's impressive. What execution velocity score would you give them?

## Expert
I would say at least 9.5. It goes back to what I was saying. I think that their productivity is high because they are very engaged, they all work very hard. More importantly, they are working on the right things so they are not wasting a lot of cycles.

## Client
Would you work with Alex again?

## Expert
Oh, totally.

## Client
Are you an angel investor in their company?

## Expert
No, I didn't actually. Not that I wouldn't. We were all so busy, I didn't even ask. I know Alex and the team well enough, they're a team I would invest in.

## Client
If you were giving Alex and the Hello Patient team guidance for the next year, you're saying, "This is the biggest risk for you with customers." What guidance would you give him so he doesn't have challenges with customers in the next 12 months?

## Expert
I would say times are challenging now. I think there's going to be more uncertainty. I do think that that's

going to lead to even more consolidation. If I were any startup, and obviously this is easier said than done, but picking the right customers is probably the first order of operations and then understanding that the problems to be solved will shift slightly. It's not that the fundamentals are going to change, but the priorities of these organizations will change. I think conditions will change enough.

## Client
I just want to make sure I understand that point. You're saying that healthcare networks are going to consolidate and go through M&A. Is that what you're saying?

## Expert
Yeah. I think there's going to be forces that will create more consolidation. There's two ways to look at it. Sometimes you could be a Trojan horse. You could be attached to a smaller organization, it gets gobbled up, and maybe you get to expand into that enterprise, but that doesn't happen very often.

Again, I'm not a product guy, I'm not that tech guy, but I've been living in this world long enough, and the landscape is always shifting enough that I see companies invest time and effort into clients. I look at it and like, "God, that's the wrong client." Picking the right client is so critical for a startup because you just don't have spare capital, time, energy.

## Client
Well, thank you so much for all your insights. This has been really helpful. I hope you enjoy the rest of your day.
