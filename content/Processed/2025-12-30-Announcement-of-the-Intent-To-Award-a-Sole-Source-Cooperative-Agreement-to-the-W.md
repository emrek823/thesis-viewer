## Abstract
ACF, Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) announces the intent to award a single-source cooperative agreement in the amount of up to $1,000,000 to the Welcoming Initiative for Newcomers (WIN) in San Diego, CA to conduct a baseline assessment of state readiness and capacity to implement a state-centered refugee resettlement framework under the Program of Initial Resettlement. The purpose is to empower states with the tools and insights needed to take control of their refugee resettlement recommendations. This nationwide baseline assessment will strengthen each state's capacity to implement a state- centered refugee resettlement framework and will include a nationwide baseline assessment of state readiness and capacity, including a nationwide readiness map, state capacity catalog, and implementation roadmap. The baseline will also include state-specific labor force shortages and corresponding industries.
