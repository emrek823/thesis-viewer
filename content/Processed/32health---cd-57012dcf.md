I can’t share anything confidential or privileged

My goal is to make this go away

Neither one of them has a non-compete

Allegation that shaju/deepak took something confidential to get a head start

Trade secret / NDA - theory that OJ has. It’s not a very good claim

Cleanest / best case scenario

Not done anything

You’re in a car with 2 drivers

The other driver is emotional - i’ve heard this not just from Deepak/Shaju. OJ and/or Wardah are emotional / reactionary

Doing what i can to put it to bed

Watham - aggressive firm. The guy is a deal lawyer. He’s just being told what to do by the CEO. It’s not consistent with a claim that he even believes in

It’s an aggressive firm

We know the board

Someone didn’t invest

I don’t want to make an allegation of a weak counter claim
