### Translucent Investment & Progress

- Invested in Translucent seed round (March) with NEA and FPV
	- Unique FP&A pitch never heard before in healthcare
	- Strong founder-market fit: Max (financial modeling expert), Jack (CIO who handled finance/ops)
- Progress exceeded expectations from memo target
	- Original goal: one health system by end of round
	- Current reality: talking to 5 health systems, 12 sales cycles active
	- Team scaling well: Peggy, Anka, Shields delivery expert
- Market opportunity compelling
	- 1-2% margin improvement on trillion-dollar healthcare spend
	- Semantic data model is key differentiator but hardest technical challenge
	- Health systems can’t hire people who know data + finance + healthcare operations

### Shobha’s Role & Technical Challenges

- Delivery and deployment strategist (Palantir-style)
	- End-to-end responsibility: customer needs, data engineering, product building, go-to-market
	- Focus on semantic data model - most interesting but hardest layer to crack
- Key integration challenges identified:
	- How fast can you identify what needs to be built (always human-driven near-term)
	- Internal platform functionality to ship quickly
	- Ensuring accuracy and appropriate functioning
- Data ingestion and delivery speed critical priorities
	- Currently making one-off data requests at Dooley/Springfield
	- Need systematic approach for faster deployment
- Previous experience comparison: Dart platform “leagues ahead” of Percepta’s internal tools
	- Superior evals functionality and modules
	- Shipping speed impressive but lacking real-world interaction for proper scoping

### Learning & Next Steps

- Smart DX as reference for semantic data modeling
	- Scott Fleming (ML research engineer) for technical approach
	- David Botts and integration team for deployment expertise
	- Spent 2-3 months per customer initially with systematic ETL process
- Viraj and Dart team as additional resources
	- Similar platform approach to Percepta but more advanced
	- Recently signed $1.3M ARR, net income positive
- Healthcare data revelation at Dooley
	- Family practice physician showed intricate 8-page spreadsheet tracking physician productivity
	- 10% productivity improvement just from better data tracking
	- Demonstrates market need for structured data solutions
