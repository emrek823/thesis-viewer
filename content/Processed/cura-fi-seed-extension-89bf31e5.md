## Slide 4: Access is limited due to the high-cost burden on today's system.

Building Blocks of Drug Care

**Payors**
Health plans & Employers
Won't pay for infusions if drugs are not approved and care cost is not managed.

**Drug 1.0 System**
X Changing authorization rules
X Slow payments, no financing
X No care oversight & tracking

**Providers**
Independent Physicians
Won't deliver infusions if inventory is too expensive and reimbursement is uncertain.
