Expert Details
Senior Director, Clinical Quality Outcomes at MPOWERHealth, a customer of Tennr.

Senior Director, Clinical Quality Outcomes at MPOWERHealth. The expert is responsible for overseeing vendor relationships with external firms. The expert is responsible for overseeing internal application development, including EMR, billing, etc.

The expert is a customer of Tennr.

Client
Hi. Thanks for taking the time to talk with me. I am interested in learning more about Tennr, which I think you are a customer of. Maybe we can just kick off with a brief overview of Mpower and what your practice looks like.

Expert
We are a national company. We provide intraoperative monitoring services. We monitor the brain and spinal cord during brain and back surgeries primarily, but also some cardiac. We are expected to cover 100,000 cases or surgeries this year.

My involvement in it, I am the senior director of clinical applications. I look at how we interact with the EMR, how we have our internal custom maps connect to the EMR, and then also manage relationships with third-party companies like Tennr that assist us in our daily operation.

Client
Got it. Roughly how many employees do you guys have or what's your rough revenue expectations for 2025?

Expert
Employees were around 600.

Client
Got it. To talk a little bit about how you came across Tennr when you started using the product, and what the use case is there.

Expert
We came across them actually from our EMR company. We, being in the intraoperative monitoring space, is a niche piece of the healthcare market. Our EMR is focused on that particular segment. I guess Tennr had reached out to them, and so they asked if we would be willing to test, Tennr, to see if they would like to partner with them as a partner in their system.

We are the largest company that use that particular EMR, and so I think that is why they reached out to us. We have a great relationship with them. We started using them, I think June of last year is when we actually implemented it, but it was March or around that point that we started talking to them.

Client
Got it. Tell me a little bit about how you are using the Tennr product. It's always helpful to hear about exactly what the use case is from buyers, since we have only described it at a high level.

Expert
Our primary use of it right now is the scheduling. As our scheduling comes in, as you can imagine, we have 100,000 cases across the country. Those are either scheduled by surgeons or facilities, for the most part, about 100,000 cases. It's a wide variety of surgeons and hospitals. We get random requests. It is requests coming through email, coming through fax, coming into our portal that we've built.

As those come in, what Tennr do for us is read those inputs, no matter how it comes in, and actually populates the information for our scheduling team into a portal. They are able to verify the information and then click yes, it looks correct, and it automatically uploads into our EMR and we're good to go.

Client
Got it. Does Tennr reach out to the patient that needs to be scheduled? Do they automate that patient outreach piece, or do your schedulers still do that?

Expert
We don't do any patient outreach. We're on the receiving end of all of that. The patients themselves, they don't reach out to us. It's the surgeons or facilities, and so they schedule us. We're working on additional layers where we do reach out to patients for additional info if needed. That's not through Tennr.

Client
Got it. I guess I'm just trying to understand. You said that what Tennr does is they take all of the information incoming and sort of automate it or populate it for your scheduling team, when the information comes in, it's like, "Person A needs to show up at Health System B at 5:00 P.M." Is that they are sending you a time already? Is there any sort of agreement that has to happen on what time the schedule will take place?

Expert
Basically, the surgeons or the facilities will already have the time established, so that information comes to us as far as the date and the time of the procedure, and we assign a technologist to show up at that time to actually provide the service.

Client
Got it. The scheduling team will need to reach out to the person that is going to show up.

Expert
Yeah, our internal team.

Client
Got it. That's still done by a person? Tennr doesn't take away the need for that person to reach out to the person on your team who's going to be doing the scheduling?

Expert
It gets put on our schedule, and then from that point, our regional managers will determine which person goes where. It goes onto our schedule as a whole. It's up to the individual territory managers to decide who goes where.

Client
Got it. Are there any other products or use cases that you have seen from Tennr that you found interesting?

Expert
Yes. We actually just had a demo today. We're getting ready to roll out the verification of benefits platform. It's another worker that they created that will go out to different either to the individual insurance portals or to our insurance clearinghouse or even phone trees to verify that the information we've received through scheduling is correct and that the patient has insurance benefits.

Client
Got it.

Expert
That's a huge lift from our team.

Client
You said that you're getting ready to roll out the verification of benefits platform, which is another worker from Tennr. I'll make sure the patient has the right qualifications that they need to get the support that you guys offer. That worker will reach out to the referring provider if there's something else that the referring provider needs to send. Is that the right way to think about it?

Expert
Not so much. They're going to reach out to the insurance company and make sure the insurance company has the patient on file, they have active benefits, and that their benefits will cover the service.

Client
Got it.

Expert
As far as reaching back out to the patient or reaching out back out to the provider, that's on our team to do that. Tennr does let us know, "Hey, this is either active or additional information is needed."

Client
Got it. Are there any other products that you've looked at from them as well?

Expert
I think we're still exploring their explanation of benefits worker, which is after the procedure is completed and the insurance company sends us what we call an EOB, or explanation of benefits. Sometimes we get them through 835, and that's a digital file and easily translated. Sometimes they send us a paper copy that comes back to our bank or comes back to email or whatever. We are looking at utilizing Tennr to read those, transcribe those, translate them into a more usable product for us on our side to input into the patient's account.

Client
Got it. What would be the purpose of that? What's the value for you guys for that?

Expert
The value there is just the time savings with preventing an individual from having to comb through the entire document. A lot of what Tennr does for us is data entry. Their real strength is their contextual AI, where they don't have to have a specific template or anything like that. You can pretty much throw anything at them, and through their proprietary algorithms and all that, they read that document, they determine what each field means, and automatically populate it into the appropriate field in our EMR for us.

Client
Got it. You would have a human on your team read the EOB and put the data into the EMR, just because you think it's a best practice to have the data in the EMR, but instead, Tennr could do that for you over time.

Expert
Tennr is going to read it and it's going to populate it into the fields that it thinks is correct, and then it's still human in the loop at this point, where we still have a human that's actually verifying that information to make sure it's correct. The cool thing about Tennr is that populates the form that it pulls it from, highlights the field and shows our team member exactly where it pulled it, what it thinks it should be. With each task, you can click on the field that tells you where in the document, which may be 10 pages long, 15 pages long, whatever, where it pulled that from populates it automatically.

The team member is able to verify, yes, that is the correct information. If it's not the correct information, they can modify it right there in the field, and Tennr takes that information, that correction, back into account as a learning tool. It's a continuously learning AI, and the next time it sees that particular template, it's more likely to pick their correct field.

Client
Got it. It sounds like at a super high level, you just described what Tennr is doing, no matter what the use case is, which is taking some document and then taking unstructured data and structuring it essentially.

Expert
100% correct.

Client
Did you ever look at trying to do this yourselves with a large language model or any of the other kinds of off-the-shelf AI tools? Do you think that you would ever try to build something like this in-house, or maybe just walk me through how you think about that?

Expert
We actually did try using some tools with Azure, and most of them required a very specific template that we would need to, basically, like through machine learning algorithms, have a large volume of samples of each particular template in order for it to be accurate. What Tennr does is more of a contextual look at it, that we have not been able to replicate, where it looks at the data. It looks at it contextually where it is very unstructured.

It comes in, it could be handwritten, it could be from any variety of different forms. Whether we've created them or it is hospital-specific or insurance provider-specific. It takes that data, extracts it, and populates it much more accurately than anything we've been able to do internally.

Client
Got it. Do you think you will keep exploring if there is a way that you could do this with OpenAI or Azure or someone else or do you think now that you have a Tennr tool, you're going to keep using it?

Expert
We plan to keep using Tennr just because they've been so successful and they have delivered for us so well. When we have tried to, like I said, perform the same functions several different times, we have looked at alternatives, we've used other companies that were contracted for other things.

Nobody has been able to replicate with the same accuracy as Tennr on this particular thing, where it's just completely unstructured. I wouldn't say random, but ever evolving. They've been able to just take any data source that we have thrown at them, and reliably extract the data that we need without a large training set.

Client
Got it. How do you think about the ROI for Tennr? What is it? Is it labor saving? Time savings? Fewer errors? How should we think about that?

Expert
Yeah, all of the above. I was actually shocked. I was in a meeting today with the person who is over the scheduling team, for our company. I know that we reported 100% increase in efficiency within the first month with Tennr, which was phenomenal to me. That is, on average, taking a new case that comes in and cutting the time to process that in half. What was shared with me today is that that has increased to a 300%-400% efficiency rating.

Client
Wow.

Expert
What used to take six to 12 minutes on average is taking one to three.

Client
That's exciting.

Expert
Very exciting for us. We have been able to increase volume exponentially without increasing our team size.

Client
Got it. Basically, Tennr's helping you see more patients and do more business at the same kind of admin cost base?

Expert
Absolutely.

Client
Got it. Have you cut any of your team, or just keeping it the same size?

Expert
We have not needed to because we have been growing exponentially through M&A to the point that we're doubling in size this year.

Client
Got it.

Expert
We have not cut anyone, but we have greatly reduced their workload. Reduced a lot of overtime, a lot of weekend work, a lot of holiday work. Kept the same team, but more than doubled our volume.

Client
Got it. What is the rough amount that you're spending with Tennr on an annual basis?

Expert
I think it's low six figures a year, but it's going to go up.

Client
You said low six figures per year?

Expert
Yes, I expect that to go up soon because our volume is increasing. We had negotiated contracts at specific rates. As we have seen our increase in volume, we're going to have to renegotiate those rates.

Client
Got it. How much do you expect your spend on Tennr to grow in the next year as you increase the volume and increase the number of products that you are using? Do you think you will double your spend or triple your spend? How do you think about it?

Expert
I expect us to double our spend.

Client
Got it. Is that including the new products that you're thinking about expanding to, like the verification of benefits and the EOB worker, or would the change just be from increased volume?

Expert
I think it's with the new workers. It's not an exponential increase in cost with increase in volume. Increased volume does equate to a doubling of cost. With the new workers and all that, I would expect that increase to double.

Client
Got it. If you had to rate your satisfaction with Tennr on a scale of 1-10, how would you rate it?

Expert
I'll preface this with I would never give a 10, but I would give Tennr a solid nine and a half. They have over-delivered on everything we have requested. We came into this with a lot of skepticism because we have had so many companies promise exactly what Tennr is actually delivering, but they were not able to deliver it. Tennr came in and blew us away. They always under promise over deliver. At least to this point, we never been disappointed with any outcome. In fact, we have always been a little bit surprised that they've been able to anticipate the next step. Very pleased with the product.

Client
Great. You said the implementation took something like three months. Is that right?

Expert
It seems like about three months for the first one. Now our VOB has been a little bit longer of a runway, but that is been on us. They produce a viable product based on our initial specs and then when we handed it over to the team that was more intimately involved with it, they requested a few additions, and then they requested a few more additions.

We're actually getting ready to release what would technically be a third viable product for that team that has just gotten better. I think I have put a stop to additional development at this point, saying, no, we need

to release a product, but it should cover 99% of our cases with just human-in-the-loop double checks versus anything being pushed back to our team to do manually.

Client
Got it. The initial implementation you said was something like three months. The explanation of the verification of benefits and EOB thing is a bit longer.

Expert
It has been a bit longer. I think their initial viable product would probably cover 95% of our caseload and we keep pushing for more. That's where I've put a stop to it at this point saying, "No, this is where we need to be to start with. If there are additional implementations further down the road, we'll do that. We can't keep chasing perfection through AI. It's just not reasonable." I think we've gone from like 95% to about 97%, 98% to now 99%. I am like, "We can't keep chasing that last 1% of edge cases."

Client
Got it. I guess last question. Do you have any view on the Tennr team?

Expert
Yes, I do. I don't know if you know them or you have seen their bios or whatever. I think part of our skepticism coming in is they looked very young, and that was part of my skepticism. I think that was part of some of the skepticism of my peers in the company, is we had been promised all these things, and then this new start-up is coming along, and I'm like, man, these kids could be my kids.

They have been incredible, and they've just blown us away as far as expectations. All of my skepticism was quickly proved to be unfounded with this group. I think they have an incredibly talented team. I think they've invested a lot up front in building a quality team and not just somebody who could fill a gap. We've been very pleased with everything they've done and very impressed with their ability to understand our requests and act on them quickly.

Client
Got it. Anything else that I have not asked that you think would be something that would be good for us to know?

Expert
I don't think so. I am just blown away by how well they have done everything we've asked of them.

Client
That's great.

Expert
Even today we had, as I said, we've grown a lot through M&A activity in the last year, and so even some of the acquisition targets we had, they were skeptical. I think we had a demo today that actually blew them out of the water. They could not believe what they were seeing with the demo. Just a great team overall.

Client
Cool. I think that is all I have for you. I guess one other question. Have you seen any other companies that are competitors to Tennr in the referral space, or not really?

Expert
Like I said, for the most part, we try to develop things internally. We haven't investigated a lot of alternatives, but the ones that we have tried, we've tried one called iTech, which is a subdivision of another company that we use for a lot of our application development. They're more along the line of traditional machine learning, where we were with their approach, and yeah, just could not really replicate the results

that contextual AI advantage that Tennr has.

Client
Got it. Sorry, how do you spell that one?

Expert
iTech.
