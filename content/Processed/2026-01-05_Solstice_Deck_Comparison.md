# Solstice Deck Comparison: Dec 28 → Jan 5

**Summary**: New deck is tighter (20→16 slides) and directly addresses concerns from the strategy feedback doc. Key upgrades are defensibility narrative and expansion clarity.

## Key Changes

| Area | Old Deck (Dec 28) | New Deck (Jan 5) | Assessment |
|------|-------------------|------------------|------------|
| **Slides** | 20 | 16 | Trimmed fat, removed FAQ slide |
| **Market Sizing** | "$100B, $40B marketing, $20B TAM" | Broken into $40B/$16.2B/$12B/$23.8B | Much sharper - shows $12B content TAM directly |
| **Defensibility** | None (just GTM slide) | NEW Slide 12: Data flywheel (brand + company level) | **Major upgrade** - addresses agency risk |
| **Roadmap** | Feature dump with "Current Offering" | Staged timeline (Today → 10 years) | Cleaner vision arc |
| **Expansion** | "Race to Top 20 logos" | ACV ladder: $300-600k → $3M+ → $10M+ | Clear path to $50M |
| **Competition** | "Can't build product" (agencies), "distracted by Salesforce" (Veeva) | Softer: "Building tech not competency" | Less aggressive, more defensible |

## Strategy Doc Concerns → Deck Response

| Strategy Doc Concern | Addressed? | How |
|---------------------|------------|-----|
| **Agency Risk** ("Can they productize?") | Partially | New defensibility slide + flywheel, but "Your Bet" slide still names it as the risk |
| **Expansion proof points** | Partially | ACV ladder added, but no concrete conversion rates |
| **Head of Sales open** | No | Still listed as hire in raise slide |
| **Whale dependency** ($5M = 50% ARR) | No | $10M+ ACV mentioned but concentration not addressed |
| **Margin visibility** | No | Not in deck (appropriate for pitch) |
| **Productization path** | Yes | Slide 8 "Now → Future" model is clearer |

## What's Better

1. **Defensibility story exists now** - Dec deck had nothing, Jan deck has the flywheel
2. **Market sizing is surgical** - $12B content execution TAM vs vague $20B
3. **Expansion math is explicit** - $500k → $3M+ → $10M+ ACV progression
4. **Competitive framing is smarter** - Less trash talk, more "built for pharma" positioning
5. **Roadmap has timeline** - Shows 10-year vision without overpromising near-term

---

## Still Missing

1. **Concrete expansion proof** - Sanofi went 3→41 brands potential, but deck doesn't cite this
2. **Head of Sales update** - Strategy doc asks "has Greg been hired?" - deck silent
3. **Whale strategy** - $5M ACV customer mentioned but not explained
4. **Margin story** - Platform vs services split (strategy doc asks 3 questions about this)

---

## Questions to Ask Solstice

From strategy doc that deck doesn't answer:

1. **What % of current revenue is platform-delivered vs engagement-lead-delivered?**
2. **Has Greg Lewis (or anyone) been hired as Head of Sales?**
3. **Sanofi: 3 brands signed, 41 potential - what's the realistic timeline?**
4. **Which customer is the $5M whale target? Pfizer? Takeda?**

---

## Bottom Line

The new deck is meaningfully better. They listened to feedback (explicitly or implicitly) and added the defensibility narrative that was missing. The "Your Bet" slide is still honest about the agency risk - that's good. Main gap: no hard proof points on land-and-expand yet. They have the Sanofi story but didn't put it in the deck.
