## Slide 3: 2026 Proposed Conversion Factor
There's something new in next year's fee schedule: two conversion factors instead of one.

Starting in 2026, Medicare will pay under separate rates depending on whether a clinician qualifies as a QP (Qualifying Participant) in an Advanced Alternative Payment Model (APM). This change comes from MACRA, which set up two tracks for physician payments:

*   MIPS (Merit-Based Incentive Payment System) – the traditional path for most clinicians.
*   Advanced APMs (Alternative Payment Models) – for clinicians who qualify as QPs (Qualifying Participants) by meeting participation thresholds in risk-bearing, value-based program

Clinicians in qualifying APMs get a slightly bigger bump. Their conversion factor increases by 3.77%, while everyone else sees a 3.26% increase. CMS says these numbers also reflect a one-year 2.5% statutory boost plus about 0.49% tied to RVU updates across certain services.

| Year | 2025 | 2026 Proposed | Difference |
| :------------------------- | :----- | :------------ | :--------- |
| Non-QP Conversion Factor | $32.35 | $33.40 | +3.26% |
| QP Conversion Factor | $32.35 | $33.57 | +3.77% |

During the rest of this analysis we will be using the Non-QP Conversion Factor of $33.40 as it applies to most physicians.

## Slide 4: 2026 CMS Proposed Rule RVU Updates
For 2026, CMS is making targeted updates to how Relative Value Units (RVUs) are calculated, aiming to better reflect real-world efficiency and cost patterns.

The new **-2.5% efficiency adjustment** trims work RVUs for non-time-based procedures that have become faster or more automated, while leaving core time-based services like E/M and care management untouched.

CMS is also modernizing the **practice expense methodology**, shifting away from outdated survey data and introducing more reliable cost inputs from hospital datasets.

Together, these updates start to rebalance payment weights across specialties. The modestly lower reimbursement for procedure-heavy codes and lift office-based, cognitive, and primary-care services.

## Slide 5: 2026 Biggest RVU Changes
### -2.5% Efficiency Adjustment
For 2026, CMS is introducing a -2.5% efficiency adjustment to eligible work RVUs for non-time-based services. The idea is to reflect gains in productivity for procedures that have become quicker or more automated. Time-based codes like E/M visits, care management, behavioral health, and maternity care are excluded. It's a quiet but important shift that starts to correct years of inflated time assumptions baked into procedure valuations.

**Most Affected**
*   Procedural specialties with non-time-based codes: **orthopedics, cardiology, general surgery, ophthalmology, and urology**
*   Services with historically high intraservice time assumptions (e.g., **imaging-guided procedures, endoscopy, and cataract surgery**)
*   Practices that rely heavily on procedure volume rather than evaluation and management visits

### Practice Expense (PE) Revisions
CMS is also updating practice expense (PE) RVUs by moving away from old survey data and incorporating more reliable hospital cost inputs. The update gives greater weight to indirect costs in office settings and less to those performed in facilities. Over time, these adjustments should narrow long-standing payment gaps between procedure-heavy and cognitive specialties.

**Most Affected**
*   Office-based specialists who absorb more indirect costs (e.g., **dermatology, ENT, allergy, and primary care**) — slight upside from higher PE weighting
*   Facility-based physicians (e.g., **hospital-employed proceduralists, radiologists, anesthesiologists**) — small relative decrease as indirect cost recognition shifts toward office settings

## Slide 6: High-Volume Codes: 2026 Payment Shifts
The 2026 updates create a clear split between office and facility settings. Office-based E/M visits rise the most, with codes 99203–99215 up roughly 6–10%, and the G2211 add-on climbing nearly 12%, showing CMS's intent to strengthen primary care. In contrast, facility-based versions of those same services drop 9–14%, as revised practice expense weights shift more reimbursement toward office overhead. A few procedural and diagnostic codes like 93000 and 88305 see small gains, while therapy codes remain steady. Overall, CMS is quietly steering dollars toward cognitive work and away from hospital-based volume.

## Slide 7: Inside the Practice Expense Update
This table isolates the practice expense (PE) component, and the declines on the facility side are striking. Most hospital and ASC-based E/M codes fall between 35% and 45%, with 99203-99215 showing some of the steepest cuts. Even high-frequency consults like 99223-99233 drop around 30–40%, as CMS shifts indirect cost recognition away from facility settings. The magnitude of these drops signals a clear methodological recalibration. CMS is effectively normalizing PE inputs across settings, tightening the link between expense assumptions and verifiable cost data rather than legacy survey estimates.

## Slide 8: 2026 CMS Proposed Rule Specialty-Level Payment Impacts

PriceMedic

---

## Slide 9: Specialty-Level Payment Impacts
This analysis models how the 2026 Physician Fee Schedule redistributes payments across medical specialties by holding utilization constant and applying the proposed rates to 2024 Medicare claims volumes. Doing so isolates the impact of CMS's policy changes, chiefly the work RVU efficiency adjustment and the updated practice expense methodology, while filtering out the noise of changing service mix or volume.

**Key Insights**

*   Office-based specialties benefit the most, generally increasing 2–5%, as practice expense weights shift toward outpatient overhead and clinical staff inputs.
*   Procedural and hospital-based specialties experience modest compression (–1–2%), primarily from lower facility practice expense values and the new efficiency adjustment to work RVUs.

The 2026 proposed rule continues CMS's long-term recalibration of relative values. By revising practice expense inputs and applying an efficiency adjustment, CMS is narrowing the gap between professional and facility reimbursement rates. Office-based fields such as internal medicine, family practice, and rheumatology see clear gains, while hospital-dependent specialties, radiology, surgery, and anesthesiology among them, face small but widespread rate compression.

The impact is not uniform, but the direction is clear. Payment growth is now concentrated in settings where clinicians bear higher fixed costs and staffing expenses, while high-throughput procedural care faces modest downward pressure. In effect, CMS is using rate structure to shift incentives toward longitudinal management and non-facility care delivery rather than expanding procedural throughput in hospital-based environments.

We will be using the Non-QP Conversion Factor of $33.40 to compute the payment differences between 2025 and 2026.

## Slide 13: 2026 Geographic Adjustment Updates
One of the most significant structural changes in the 2026 Physician Fee Schedule is how CMS is updating the Geographic Practice Cost Indices (GPCIs), which determine how Medicare payments vary across localities based on differences in wages, office expenses, and malpractice costs. CMS is phasing in a new data refresh over two years, 2026 and 2027, instead of implementing all changes at once. This approach smooths the transition for regions that would otherwise face sharp payment swings.

Instead of doing one big reset and letting some regions take a sudden hit, CMS is phasing it in over 2026 and 2027. That gives practices time to adapt while new data sources work their way into the formula.

A key detail behind some of the regional dips is the expiration of the **1.0 Work GPCI floor** at the end of September 2025, which had previously guaranteed a minimum work adjustment for certain areas.

To keep things consistent in the visuals, we'll summarize all three components, Work, Practice Expense, and Malpractice, using each locality's Geographic Adjustment Factor (GAF). GAFs don't change how payments are calculated, but they're a clean shorthand for showing how all three GPCIs move together between 2025, 2026, and 2027. They're simply a weighted blend of those components, giving a quick snapshot of how each market's overall adjustment is shifting.

## Slide 15: Geographic Adjustments: Largest Lifts
The biggest jumps this year are clustered around metro markets that already run hot. Atlanta takes the top spot with a 1.3% lift, reflecting higher wage inputs and practice expenses. California dominates the rest of the list — San Jose, Napa, and Vallejo all tick up as updated rent and labor data push their costs higher. Even statewide Colorado lands in the mix, showing that the adjustments aren't limited to the coasts. These increases aren't huge on their own, but they signal where CMS's new cost models are recognizing sustained inflation in local inputs.

## Slide 16: Geographic Adjustments: Largest Drops
On the flip side, most of the declines are modest but centered in regions that had been propped up by the 1.0 Work GPCI floor, which expires later in 2025. Arkansas takes the steepest dip at -1.5%, followed by slight pullbacks across Alaska, Arizona, and several East Coast markets like Connecticut and the DC metro area. Even high-cost spots such as Los Angeles and Hawaii edge down a bit, showing how the recalibration is trimming outliers before the full phase-in hits in 2027.
