### Russell’s Background & Experience

- 15+ years in healthcare, started at Oscar Health (2017)
	- One of first 3 sales executives when team <10 people
	- Launched small group product in NY/NJ, individual product in Philadelphia
- Founded Parkinson’s disease mobility device company
	- Fundraising failed when COVID hit (high-risk medical device)
- Medallion (first 20 employees, pre-Series A)
	- First director-level sales hire
	- Sold first 3 seven-figure deals, ~20% of total revenue base
	- Helped scale from <$1M to $19M in <2 years
	- Built sales team from 3 to 25+ (AEs, BDRs, managers)
- Currently at Simpler (November 2024)
	- Leading team of 6 enterprise sellers (provider data management)
	- Cut inherited team from 8 to 2, rebuilt to 6
	- Sold 40% of company’s 2025 revenue

### Lightspun Opportunity Assessment

- Russell’s interest in transitioning from founder-led to structured sales organization
	- Plans Boston visit in late February for pipeline deep dive
	- Wants to understand nature of existing partnerships (Guardian, ADA)
	- Currently healthy pipeline from sales consultants and relationships
- Missing components Russell identifies:
	- Structured prospecting workflows
	- Repeatable sales process/machine
	- Strategic account prioritization

### Sean’s Perspective on Lightspun’s Commercial Needs

- Product strength assessment:
	- Top-tier product capability across credentialing ($250-500K) to adjudication platform (7-figure ACV)
	- Strong client references and NPS
	- Multi-module platform enables land-and-expand strategy
- Commercial execution gaps:
	- Need senior commercial leader, not junior hire
	- Shaju excellent at relationship building but needs sales muscle
	- Significant untapped demand exists, especially for 7-figure deals
- Market position:
	- $150-200B+ dental market opportunity
	- Best-in-breed for administrative dental solutions
	- Series A investors feedback: “Need to see the numbers”

### Strategic Sales Approach Discussion

- Leveraging Shaju’s network effectively:
	- Strong domain expertise and trust in dental space
	- Challenge: converting friendly relationships into hard sales
	- Need to productize existing relationships with commercial strategy
- Russell’s approach philosophy:
	- Focus on qualifying and pain point identification vs. selling entire vision
	- Emphasis on mutual action plans and accountability
	- Land-and-expand rather than platform sale approach
- Immediate opportunity:
	- Low-hanging fruit available with proper commercial execution
	- Strong foundation for 2-3 person “killer” sales team
	- Potential for early wins rather than 2-3 year build cycle
