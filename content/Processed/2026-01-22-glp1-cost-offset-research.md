# The NBER Finding Is Not an Outlier — GLP-1s Do Not Generate Cost Offsets

**Bottom line:** The NBER paper's finding that GLP-1s increase (not decrease) healthcare spending is consistent with every other major claims-based study. No credible research shows GLP-1s pay for themselves through medical cost savings. This is now consensus among health economists.

**Critical nuance:** GLP-1s DO reduce specific high-cost events (hospitalizations, CV events). But these savings are overwhelmed by drug costs and increased outpatient utilization. Clinical benefit ≠ economic benefit.

## The Evidence: Multiple Studies, Same Conclusion

### Study 1: NBER Working Paper 34678 (Wing et al.)
- **Data:** Merative MarketScan, 537,000 GLP-1 initiators, 2016-2023
- **Finding:** Non-GLP-1 spending INCREASES 9% at year 1, 30% at year 5
- **Methodology:** Stacked difference-in-differences

### Study 2: Prime Therapeutics Real-World Analysis (2024)
- **Data:** Commercial claims, 2-year follow-up
- **Finding:** "No cost offsets or obesity-related medical event reductions should be expected for those treated with GLP-1s" during first two years
- **Cost:** $11,200 per patient investment over 2 years at standard prices
- Source: [Prime Therapeutics GLP-1 Study](https://www.primetherapeutics.com/documents/d/primetherapeutics/glp-1-year-2-cost-effectiveness-study-abstract-10-24-24)

### Study 3: EBRI Employer Plan Analysis (2024)
- **Finding:** "No evidence to suggest that the savings would fully offset GLP-1 prices"
- **Premium impact:** 5.3% to 13.8% increase expected, NOT recovered through medical savings
- Source: [EBRI GLP-1 Analysis](https://www.ebri.org/content/glp-1-coverage-and-its-impact-on-employment-based-health-plan-premiums--a-simulation-based-analysis)

### Study 4: Medicare Fiscal Impact (JAMA Health Forum, 2025)
- **Data:** Microsimulation, 30M beneficiaries over 10 years
- **Finding:** $65.9B drug costs vs $18.2B health savings = **$47.7B net increase**
- **Offset ratio:** Only 28% of drug costs recovered through medical savings
- Source: [JAMA Health Forum Medicare Analysis](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12032556/)

### Study 5: Congressional Budget Office (2024)
- **Finding:** "Total savings from beneficiaries' improved health would be small – less than $50 million in 2026 and rising to $1.0 billion in 2034"
- **Context:** Against tens of billions in drug spending

## The Paradox: Clinical Success, Economic Failure

### GLP-1s DO Reduce Specific Costly Events

| Outcome | Reduction | Source |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| Heart failure hospitalization + mortality | **>40%** | [Mass General Brigham, JAMA 2025](https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/glp-1-drugs-reduce-risk-of-death-in-patients-with-heart-failure) |
| Major CV events (SELECT trial) | **20%** | [NEJM 2023](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2307563) |
| CV events in T2D (SUSTAIN-6) | **26%** | AHA Journals |
| Diabetes incidence | **40-50%** | Multiple RCTs |

### But Total Costs Still Rise Because:

1. **Drug costs dominate** — $12,000-15,000/year swamps any savings
2. **Outpatient spending increases** — More visits for titration, monitoring, side effects
3. **Benefits require continuous treatment** — Weight and CV improvements revert within 1 year of stopping
4. **Adherence collapses** — Only 14% remain on therapy at 3 years ([HealthVerity](https://blog.healthverity.com/glp-1-trends-2025-real-world-data-patient-outcomes-future-therapies))
5. **Induced demand** — Patients on GLP-1s engage more with healthcare system

## What Price Would Make GLP-1s Cost-Neutral?

| Analysis | Cost-Neutrality Threshold | Current Price | Gap |
|----------|---------------------------|---------------|-----|
| UChicago (QALY-based) | **$3,000-4,000/yr** | $12,000-15,000 | 70-80% reduction needed |
| USC Schaeffer (value-based) | **$7,500-8,900/yr** (Medicare) | $12,000-15,000 | 30-40% reduction needed |
| ICER analysis | Semaglutide needs **80% price cut**, Tirzepatide needs **30% cut** | Current net prices | Per [UChicago Medicine](https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/forefront/research-and-discoveries-articles/glp-1-drug-pricing-analysis) |

**Key insight:** Even at $0 drug cost, the NBER paper suggests GLP-1s would STILL increase total spending by ~$585/year due to induced medical utilization.

## Comparison to Bariatric Surgery

Bariatric surgery provides the contrast case:

| Metric | GLP-1s | Bariatric Surgery |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| 2-year total cost | $63,483 | $51,794 |
| 2-year weight loss | 10.3% | 28.3% |
| Sustained 10%+ loss at 2 years | 46% | 96% |
| Break-even vs GLP-1 | — | 9-18 months |
| Long-term cost offset | No | Yes (documented) |

Source: [JAMA Surgery 2024](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamasurgery/fullarticle/2839126), [Surgical Endoscopy](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00464-024-11191-1)

Bariatric surgery IS cost-effective (ICER of -$9,094/QALY — i.e., it SAVES money while adding QALYs). GLP-1s are not.

## Why the NBER Study Methodology Is Sound

### What It Does Well:
- Large sample (537,000 initiators)
- Claims data captures actual spending (not modeled)
- Stacked DID controls for selection bias
- Intent-to-treat analysis (real-world adherence)
- Subgroup analysis confirms findings across populations

### Legitimate Limitations:
1. **Time horizon** — 5 years may be too short; CV event prevention could take 10+ years to show savings
2. **Commercial population only** — Excludes Medicare (older, sicker) and Medicaid
3. **Can't measure productivity** — Absenteeism, disability, earnings not in claims
4. **Pre-SELECT era** — Data ends 2023; doesn't capture CV-indication prescribing

### But These Don't Invalidate the Core Finding:
The Medicare simulation (JAMA 2025) modeled 10-year horizon with full clinical benefits assumed → still $47.7B net cost increase. The CBO modeled even longer → minimal savings.

## Contradictions & Open Questions

### Unresolved:
1. **What specific visit types drive outpatient increases?** — Neither NBER nor others decompose this
2. **Do super-responders (>15% weight loss) show different cost trajectory?** — No stratified analysis
3. **Does indication (diabetes vs obesity) matter for offsets?** — NBER says no, but sample sizes differ

### Needs Further Research:
- Productivity/disability claims (not in medical claims data)
- 10+ year horizons with real-world data (not simulation)
- Responder-stratified cost analysis

---

## Recommendations

1. **The NBER finding should be treated as validated** — Multiple independent analyses confirm no cost offset
2. **Thesis implication:** Any GLP-1-related investment predicated on "payers will embrace because it saves money" is wrong
3. **The bull case must rest on:** Consumer demand, political pressure, generic pricing (2031+), or indication expansion to populations where payers MUST cover
4. **Bariatric surgery is the comparison point** — It achieves cost savings GLP-1s don't

**Bull case:** Generics at $1,500/year + virtual management + responder selection could potentially reach cost-neutrality by 2033-2035

**Bear case:** Even at lower prices, induced utilization may prevent cost savings; adherence patterns suggest most patients won't get long-term benefit anyway
