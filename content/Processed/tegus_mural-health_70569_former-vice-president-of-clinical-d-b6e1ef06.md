**Tegus Client**
Thanks for talking about the clinical trial market and specifically hoping to better understand how tools that are used for payments and budgeting and vendor management work, and how folks like yourself use them. So, could you start by telling us about your background?

**Former Vice President of Clinical Development at Karyopharm Therapeutics**
By training, I'm a heme oncologist. I work in clinical development and research and development, clinical operation as well as compliance for the past 22 years. I lead a medium-sized R&D group. Our responsibilities include but not limited to identifying and working through vendors associated with the patient site as well as vendors, service management.

Some of the identification and working through those vendors would require us to also qualify them for receiving the reports associated with the financial expenditures and in turn using those information in a data that we have for other projections or budgeting and things or such.

**Tegus Client**
That's great. So it sounds like you work for a pharmaceutical sponsor, and you manage clinical operations and are responsible for managing both the vendors that you select and then also the vendors that may be a third party like a site is using.

**Former Vice President of Clinical Development at Karyopharm Therapeutics**
Correct. There's senses of track research organization, these other vendors, whether they're working as a pass-through or something else, they have to be qualified, complied with, and also, we work directly with them through the project management group. That's how it works.

**Tegus Client**
And then just a question on your responsibilities and then also the broader pharmaceutical sponsor. How many clinical trials would you be overseeing at once?

**Former Vice President of Clinical Development at Karyopharm Therapeutics**
Right now, I have 26 individual trials Phases 1 through three. I oversee a portfolio of 12 products. And of the 12 products, only four of them are active in clinical trials, which expand over the 26 trials. Prior to this, I was responsible for a portfolio of oncology only at Sanofi. So Sanofi ongoingly over the probably the 5 years I was there, we had somewhere to the tune of 33 trials in average at one time, so to speak, per Q.

Obviously, trials come and go. CSR happens. You closed the trial, but other trials piggyback in the process. So in average, those are the numbers usually in the grander portfolio.

**Tegus Client**
So is the 27 trial that the sponsor you're working for is running at the time, or is that just what your overseeing?

**Former Vice President of Clinical Development at Karyopharm Therapeutics**
26 that my company as a sponsor is running at this time. We have 11, 12 active INDs, which expands 26 multiple trials on those INDs.

**Tegus Client**
And then when thinking about the vendors that you use specifically regarding payments and budgeting. I guess, first off, do you use vendors, or is that done in-house?

**Former Vice President of Clinical Development at Karyopharm Therapeutics**
No. We use vendors for payments and the reports that we get from the vendors for budgeting also. Now some vendors, their job is slightly different and in addition to just being a vendor, so I'll give you an example, we have actually two vendors that their job is to make payments to patient sites and other vendors, something that our SAP does also.

You could invoice me, and you're on my contract, and I put you in SAP, and my department pays you. I oversee 4 departments, clinical development operation, pharmacovigilance and BioStat and data management.

These are the four that my budget actually expands over and also CMC, GMP system. So these vendors, they make payments to individuals or individual companies in addition to what SAP does also, and these two systems are supposed to be able to talk with one another.

And also the payment process has to have some inner link of application program interface communication between the pay and payer, which is the intermediary. So it's more than just making a payment. It's more than gone a portal and just release a payment. It's making a payment, keep track of it, give you forecast of payment, give you reports of the payment, make communication with the pay and the payers and so on and so forth.

**Tegus Client**
That's helpful. And if I heard you correctly, used two vendors and then SAP?

**Former Vice President of Clinical Development at Karyopharm Therapeutics**
Yes. SAP is our global financial payment system, which is connected with our accounting group. So SAP is both the intra and inter accounting tool for budgeting, including. But then again, we have vendor systems that they make payments to other people for other reasons.

**Tegus Client**
What are the two vendors that you use outside of SAP?

**Former Vice President of Clinical Development at Karyopharm Therapeutics**
So we have Mural Health is one vendor for the patient as well as some vendor in clinical supply system. And also, we have Medidata Group, Meta Pay is another one, which does relatively the same, but in the same venue.

**Tegus Client**
Have you heard of any other folks doing this job, like we've heard of Greenphire, Ledger Run. Have you heard of them at all?

**Former Vice President of Clinical Development at Karyopharm Therapeutics**
Yes. Greenphire, for instance, works with us through CRO. So you could say that they are also our vendor,

but the way it works is we just track their payment system, but we make the payment to the CRO, there are pass-through payer system through ACRO. These are all similar to Mural Health.

Now the reason that we have Mural Health, and we don't have them through ACRO or another vendor because we use Mural Health for our, what you may call, compassionate user studies. So in the compassionate use, it gets a little bit tweaky, so to speak, a little bit complicated.

**Tegus Client**
So you use Medidata, and you use Mural for payment at SAP. And when did you start using these folks?

**Former Vice President of Clinical Development at Karyopharm Therapeutics**
Mural Health came into the picture, if I'm not mistaken, March of 2023. Prior to that, we have Prolocor, which is a similar system. We had some challenges with them. We did our overall view of this space to have someone take Q1 of 2023.

But when we have to go through a process by which we identify the vendors, especially when it's a matter of financials. So this time around, Mural Health came in March of 2023 with us. I mean they went a beta function 2023.

**Tegus Client**
And you said that replaced Prolocor?

**Former Vice President of Clinical Development at Karyopharm Therapeutics**
Yes.

**Tegus Client**
Got it. And what was the thinking behind moving away from Prolocor?

**Former Vice President of Clinical Development at Karyopharm Therapeutics**
We had some challenges with the portal at one point or another. The fee is higher. The pass-through fee is also higher than Mural Health. Another thing that we had challenges with them was the API, literally didn't work with SAP. So we had to download the reports from them into SAP and periodically do some manual work on it. With Mural Health, it's an auto API. The application program interface actually works seamlessly.

**Tegus Client**
Got it. And then Mural, there were many payments to patients or participants in the clinical trial and some vendors in the supply chain?

**Former Vice President of Clinical Development at Karyopharm Therapeutics**
Yes. I mean you could literally set them up for project management payments. You could set them up for almost everything that the system works. You could do a lot of things. We're not using all of those features. Mural Health could work as a stand-alone project payment tool. In other words, it pays the participants, it could pay vendors.

It could give them the payment plan associated with the projection of payments. So when timeline milestones are met according to the contract, you can set it up and make the payments, things that you usually manually are doing SAP and systems alike.

**Tegus Client**
And then Medidata is doing something similar with other vendors in the supply chain?

**Former Vice President of Clinical Development at Karyopharm Therapeutics**
Yes. The only reason that we have MediPay, which is a suite of Medidata system is MediPay works directly

with our Rave System, which is electronic data capture. So when you have so many patients at the site, the payment to the site could be released and things like that, exactly what I just said, but with the twist that it works very well with EDC system that we're using, which is a Medidata product.

**Tegus Client**
So I guess the gap is, the sites are not paid by either, unless they're included in the supply chain.

**Former Vice President of Clinical Development at Karyopharm Therapeutics**
Some sites or some investigative groups that they do, I mean, they're like sites that they actually do the compassionate use for us. Like U.S. Oncology is a group of 125 different practitioners and sites that they do compassionate use for us. Every one of them are designed to be a site. But they are one-off INDs individual patient there, or no more than five patients at a time.

So many Mural Health pays for those. It pays the patients, it pays a site for that. This is outside of the clinical trial phases one through three. So you may call them a site, or you may call them vendor, or you may just call them participants, whatever you want to call them. But anecdotally, they're all the same as far as the payment and the process and the regulatory compliance are concerned.

**Tegus Client**
And then if Mural Health or Medidata is working with the EDC, who's paying the sites?

**Former Vice President of Clinical Development at Karyopharm Therapeutics**
So for the clinical trials, the sites are usually paid by the project management. We don't have any studies that we manage ourselves. Everything is done through the CROs. So literally, the payment and the contract and the financial responsibilities to the sites are done through the CROS.

However, when the CROs are receiving clinical supplies, when the patients at the sites are receiving financial compensation for the time and travel, when the patients have invoices associated with the ancillary charges and things like that, they're all done through Mural Health.

**Tegus Client**
And then so for the clinical trial sites, those are managed by the CRO they work with. And then going back to your earlier point, that's where you're familiar with the company Ledger Run.

**Former Vice President of Clinical Development at Karyopharm Therapeutics**
Correct.

**Tegus Client**
And then do you use the same CRO for all of the 26 clinical trials that you're running?

**Former Vice President of Clinical Development at Karyopharm Therapeutics**
We have two major CROs. One is IQVIA, the other one is PPD. When I was at Sanofi, and we had similar systems set up there, we were using five different CROs at the same time. Now don't forget, not all trials are just done by these two.

For instance, there are sites that they are managed by other CROs in Europe or in Asia Pac, along the same global study that the project management is done by IQVIA, PPD, but there are actually other CROs that they do, and we have five different CROs as secondary CROs that they do regional work with IQVIA. So you could say that in total, we have seven CROs, but those five are working under the umbrella of PPD and IQVIA.

**Tegus Client**
And you're probably intermittently familiar with Mural in Medidata, are you interacting with Ledger Run at all?

**Former Vice President of Clinical Development at Karyopharm Therapeutics**
Yes, not only myself, but project management. So we had to understand them. We had to run them through the compliance questions. We had to qualify them as a vendor. We have to appreciate the KPCs, which has proven track record, is the API working?

Can they work closely with us as well as the direct vendor, which is the CRO? And all of those questions, they had to be qualified. So you could say that we had to qualify them as we would have qualified to any other vendor.

**Tegus Client**
And when did the qualification happen?

**Former Vice President of Clinical Development at Karyopharm Therapeutics**
About 1.5 years ago, they also had Zura Bio at first, and they changed also. So I would say, about three quarters ago, if I'm not mistaking, that process went through two, three quarters ago.

**Tegus Client**
So if you qualified Ledger Run as a vendor for your sponsor three quarters ago. And that was through PPD.

**Former Vice President of Clinical Development at Karyopharm Therapeutics**
It was through first IQVIA and then we asked PPD to take them on also.

**Tegus Client**
So they get qualified. And then I assume it may have been an improved experience over legacy, but what made you push them from IQVIA to PPD?

**Former Vice President of Clinical Development at Karyopharm Therapeutics**
One vendor works. We say yes to it, and we try to ask other systems to work. Plus once we start working, and we're familiar with the portal, and we're familiar with working with them, and we know that, I mean, just like any other vendors, if it works for you, why do you have to change it?

So we say, okay, we have a proven track record with vendor X. We'd like for you to use them. It's a pass-through fee. To them, it really doesn't matter. All they have to make sure is for the compliance, they pass them this fast, it's a yes or no, they're compliant or not. And the rest is just history. As far as CRO is concerned, it's not a big deal to them because it's a pass through. Of course, they have their own preferred vendors, and they try to push it.

But we usually, for these types of things, we'd like to have our own recommended systems. And the reason is, again, that system has to work with our system, and we don't want an intermediary, which usually; a, it's more expensive, intermediary being CRO becomes to be more expensive for us; and b, it's more challenging. So we try to hold on to the financial end of the game as much as possible.

**Tegus Client**
That makes sense. And going back to what this ecosystem looks like, Mural is for supply chain and patient payments, Medidata for EDC-related supply chain payments and then you have Ledger Run currently at the site or CRO payment manner. Was there somebody that you used previously in place of Ledger Run or interactive with previously?

**Former Vice President of Clinical Development at Karyopharm Therapeutics**
So we had two systems in the past for some of the stuff we used G2, but for most of the stuff we use Medi, which we had challenges with Medi for many reasons. But outside of that, we did a lot of manual work through SAP. So that was also a challenge. And that's the reason we went to a vendor like Mural Health.

So we went through the process. Prolocor at one point also was one of the vendors that we walked away

from them because the API wasn't working well. So we went through evolution over the past three years of some manual work through SAP, some like sporadic groups. And then we're trying to consolidate the process by having MSA with Mural Health.

**Tegus Client**
I'm just thinking specifically for Ledger Run and what was used prior, but it sounds like a similar development where you try to do some things in house, you make this yours, you use Medidata, but you had issues, right?

**Former Vice President of Clinical Development at Karyopharm Therapeutics**
Correct.

**Tegus Client**
So to think about Ledger Run, then we can move to Mural Health, is this just simply like a purpose-built tool to handle site payments, and that's why they win, and they understand the user and issue better than most?

**Former Vice President of Clinical Development at Karyopharm Therapeutics**
Yes. So usually or I should say, traditionally, CROs make certain payments to the sites and the sites invoice the CROs. Clinical supplies, additional materials, including kits, patient payments, ancillary costs associated with the patients and also noncentralized payments and the list goes on. So this creates several problems.

That's the reason we have companies like that to sit in the middle of these payment process. So technically, what we are trying to do, and we have been doing it in the industry, including Sanofi was doing it, and now KPTI and, I guess, many companies. We have groups like Prolocor, InnaMed, Zura, Mural Health, Ledger and Greenphire.

These guys would come in and take on some of those process charges that I just mentioned. Instead of sending patients directly the card, the visa card for their, let's say, co-IMPs, co-Investigation of Medicinal Products, that you could use for drugs. That's a big number. Payments, tracking, all of that is huge.

That is done directly by companies like Mural Health. And you want to take the CRO out of this game because what CRO does, they have the intermediary payment process with the site. So the site charges an arm and a leg, then the CRO charges something on the top of it for processing and everything else.

By the time it comes to us, the old anecdote and aspirin is going to cost us $20 each. This way, the cost associated with those ancillaries are very small. So what we learn over time is cost per patient per trial by using tools like this can come down to about 20% over the length of the study.

Now average cost in oncology per patient can run as much as $155,000 per patient. Some studies, they go all the way to $250,000. So what you can see 10%, 15% or even 20% that we're trying to push for using tools like that, that's the ROI for us. Now if we pay no more than one, 1.5 points for the value cost per month, it's like an invoice financing for us. That's what the fee comes to. It's a no-brainer. It's a win for us. Even at net 120, it's a win for us.

**Tegus Client**
So it sounds like the ROI here for getting a third party like we are all Ledger Run, Greenphire, whomever is they're saving you 15% to 20%.

**Former Vice President of Clinical Development at Karyopharm Therapeutics**
Yes, that's for the life of the study. Now a typical study goes anywhere between 18 to 36 months. So let's say, 15% of $150,000, that's $22,500 for three years. But if you multiply that to about give and take 3,800, 3,900 patients that we serve at a time, it's about $1.5 million for us per year.

**Tegus Client**
That's helpful. And then thinking about all these folks, and you don't want the CRO to dictate what payment

method you use, but it sounds like you're happy with Ledger Run more so than working Medidata and other legacy approaches, you work with Mural Health. It sounds like they're two different use cases. But can they be competitive? Can they do the same thing?

**Former Vice President of Clinical Development at Karyopharm Therapeutics**
Certain things, they could be competitive. Competitive means doing the same thing. And certain things, there are differentiation between these two. I'll give you a prime example. Mural Health they give you a good portal that you could get seamless in real-time reports. No one else, in our opinion, could give us the custom report that we want.

Now because they have about 10, 15 types of reports, you can get projections, all kinds of stuff. You could see growth per site. You could get growth per patient. You could get growth per region, per study, just like Luminance used to give us in the old days. That's another tool for something else.

So to me, that's a differentiation that we sell in Mural Health that I haven't seen it. It's the report capability of producing those useful reports. In addition to that, we could have our SaaS programmers to provide shells, we could feed it to Mural Health people, and they could give us custom reports. And that's another thing that we couldn't get it with other people. Like Zura Bio wouldn't be able or Prolocor wouldn't be able to give us those.

So there are differentiations between these vendors. One is, as I said, reporting the other one, custom reporting. The third one is the portal. Does it work all the time. The fourth is proven track record, the virtue of, does it work with our API system or not?

In other words, does it work with my SAP? Does it work with other similar tools that we use because we got to pull all the information together and get amalgamated and consolidated data to regurgitate and produce projections. Given what I just said, it helps us.

Now there's a bigger picture to this conversation. Patients, they are supposed to be tracked, their habits and everything else. Now there are some tools that we're implementing with Mural Health that it allows us to do that. Other tools, we have learned that they weren't as easy to do this patient tracking. So because of that, that would become a differentiation. That's not necessarily a competition if that make sense to you.

**Tegus Client**
That's helpful. I was just more curious because it sounds like you're happy with Ledger Run. It sounds like they do two different things for you. Let's say you do remove the CRO, what are you using to pay sites?

**Former Vice President of Clinical Development at Karyopharm Therapeutics**
If we remove the CRO, we may or may not keep the payment system. In other words, let's say, a CRO does not so well in one study, and we have to change our CRO over time, is that what you're asking?

**Tegus Client**
Not exactly. You said, ideally, the CROs don't dictate who you use to pay sites, if I heard you correctly. Let's say that you had your choice to pay the sites and are deciding to pay the tool to pay the site, who would that vendor be?

**Former Vice President of Clinical Development at Karyopharm Therapeutics**
So if I had my choice to pay the sites, it's a difficult process because today if I had to make a choice to directly pay the site as opposed to the site payment alone, that's the PI and the site fee, which is done by the CRO. If I had to make a choice in that front, I would initially like to do it in-house with my own SAP and my own project manager to keep tracking everything, but over time, potentially, we'll be looking for a unified MSA vendor.

And if you would say, well, among all of them, who you would choose, frankly, I haven't thought about it. So I can't give you a direct answer. Probably any one of them can do that task. It's relatively conceivable that anybody can do that. It doesn't have to be the MSA holder, but you use the MSA because it's easy to work

with one vendor, but not necessarily because site payment is not a big deal.

Site payment and tracking how the site payment is done, usually, it's on a time clock per patient, you make a payment and then you have a site maintenance fee that you pay a site, and that's that. So site payment is not a complicated process. The other fees are complicated. They are smaller in the bigger chunk of the cost. But to track those, those are the more complicated ones. Site payment is not very complicated.

**Tegus Client**
Who are you comparing this to?

**Former Vice President of Clinical Development at Karyopharm Therapeutics**
I am comparing it with the in-house CRO or Ledger or anyone else in making payments to the sites.

**Tegus Client**
And then going back to the CRO comment you made that you would prefer to dictate who they use for payment vendor yourself. Do you see that dynamic changing?

**Former Vice President of Clinical Development at Karyopharm Therapeutics**
Not in my company. I don't think medium and large organizations tend to make any changes that way. Small companies, the small volume of the sites, and small volume of clinical trials maybe. But once it becomes more than five, six trials; 100, 150, when the number of the sites and the trials go up, you have to have this structure or it becomes humanly impossible to keep track of everything.

**Tegus Client**
So you use two payment vendors internally right now. Medidata and Mural. Do you see Mural taking the role of whatever Medidata is doing for you right now?

**Former Vice President of Clinical Development at Karyopharm Therapeutics**
Eventually, we are thinking about amalgamating them, perhaps use one as a check and balance and the other one as a functional tool per se. In other words, one piggyback and the other one for reporting checks, alerts and things like that. And maybe down the road, if those features are repeated, just pick one. And if I had to make a choice today, I would go with Mural Health and Medi.

**Tegus Client**
And what's the deal with Mural, like you adopted them recently through a pilot? Medidata is doing quite a few things better. How do you hear about them?

**Former Vice President of Clinical Development at Karyopharm Therapeutics**
I knew of them in the past, some of the people that I worked with, they knew of them also. Medi has been an IBM company sitting in California. There are smaller ones sitting in Pennsylvania. It's easier to get a hold of people, having conversation, getting training.

Small company, hungry, lower costs, having the tools that we want, that's the deal as far as I'm concerned. Last but not least, as I said, easier to get a hold of someone if we have issues. If there are glitches in the system, if the API is not working, they come help us out. Those are the usual reasons. Again, they're much cheaper by about 40%, 50% in overall cost and services they provide.

**Tegus Client**
And are they cheaper? You mentioned, I believe, Greenphire and maybe a few others that are 40% to 50% cheaper than them?

**Former Vice President of Clinical Development at Karyopharm Therapeutics**
Not that much cheaper than them. They're cheaper than Medi. Medi is really expensive.

**Tegus Client**
And then have you heard them working with CROs to bridge payments from a sponsor like yours to a PPD or IQVIA? Again within Mural Health and Ledger Run?

**Former Vice President of Clinical Development at Karyopharm Therapeutics**
Yes. So Mural Health told us that they work with top 20 CROs. We usually relate to them as top five. When I asked IQVIA if we would call Mural Health as a preferred vendor for the studies that they run? They said that they're not currently working with them. So it was confusing for us. So at least for the top two and then we didn't dig into that conversation that much.

So are they doing? I don't know. They said they do. We are not using them that way. We wanted to have the diversified vendor system, but at one point or another, I wouldn't pass by us to go back to the drawing board and try to have one and then slip it through the new studies as they roll out. Because once the study starts and you have the vendors, it's very difficult to pull the vendors out of that study. I mean we prefer not to do that.

And in my opinion, we shouldn't. You should just work with the worst-case scenario and until the end of that study. But then again, it could be that you hold on to the same CRO, but you go through different set of vendors instead of Ledger, you go with Mural Health, but we haven't done that transition process yet in the conversation. But eventually, probably, yes.

**Tegus Client**
This is helpful. And then do you see your peers with a similar, like, let's say, somebody in a similar role that you add another pharmaceutical sponsor? Do they have the same amalgamation of payment vendors?

**Former Vice President of Clinical Development at Karyopharm Therapeutics**
Medium-sized peers, yes. Large companies, it's a little bit different. Like when I was at Sanofi and when I was at BMS, life was a little bit different. They didn't mind paying extra to one vendor and have one or two MSAs and that's set.

By the way, I mean, you have a larger portfolio anyways when you're at those companies. And I had only been working with one vertical oncology inflammatory disease in those places.

But don't forget, these companies, they have at least five to 15 different therapeutic areas, including devices in there. So it becomes a bigger discussion. And clinical operation usually works at the vendors relation system.

So who they work with, how they work with, how they contain costs is a different formula. So the top 20 pharmas, they behave a little bit differently than a small medium-sized companies like us. But among my backyard, so to speak, yes, we all work reasonably the same way.

**Tegus Client**
It isn't the same like everybody is pretty excited about Mural Health at the moment, or is it a combination of the vendors that we've discussed?

**Former Vice President of Clinical Development at Karyopharm Therapeutics**
What I hear from, and in October, I got to go to a conference that I get better understanding of who does what. But what I hear is everybody is relatively okay with the combination of the companies they're using, whether it's pass-through service provider through their CRO or just the CRO brings them on or they just do a one-off themselves like we are doing plus the CRO or just one-off throughout the process.

Most of the people that they use these types of systems, they have at least two-vendor system. In other words, at least two set of vendors working side-by-side. In our case, we have more than two, but that's usually the case. We have one major, which is Mural Health, then we have Ledger and Greenphire and so on and so forth, working through PPD, IQVIA.

**Tegus Client**
And then for the larger folks, larger sponsors, who are they using? I don't think we've covered that, but I'd be curious, are there similar grouping of vendors?

**Former Vice President of Clinical Development at Karyopharm Therapeutics**
Nine out of 10, those guys like I know BMS use Medi and SAP, which the cost is high. I know they're doing cost-containing measures so they're going to go to smaller systems like this. Nine out of 10 they don't use these systems yet.

And the reason is the extra that they pay for the fees associated with these type of payments and tracking and things like that gets absorbed with the discount that they get for the high volume MSA with the CROs. So you don't mind paying a little bit extra because on the top on volume, they get discount. But a lot of people that I know like BMS, GSK, they're all using SAP for now. which is tedious, cumbersome.

**Tegus Client**
I mean you see Greenphire is a more common name, and they've been around for some time. The way we understand is they administer, sponsor a patient or zero on patient payments. Are they not being used by those folks?

**Former Vice President of Clinical Development at Karyopharm Therapeutics**
I think they're mostly working as a vendor to the CRO, not necessarily to the sponsor directly yet.

**Tegus Client**
But it sounds like you expect there to be somewhat of a refresh in the top 20 sponsors speaking and a move away from SAP or Medidata, right?

**Former Vice President of Clinical Development at Karyopharm Therapeutics**
Yes, because everybody, when we go through the cycles of cost containing measures, now we are doing it in 2023, I don't put it past by the systems to try to tighten the belts on every nook and crannies of operational cost, and this is a part of that for the streamline of the payment process.

**Tegus Client**
I get it. So just going back to who you're using there. So you use Medidata, it sounds like there are some part where there is costs that they're good with the EDC, but may look to reevaluate that with Mural. Mural, you're very happy with thus far, but it's been less than a year.

Later on, you indirectly work with but have asked other CROs to adopt them. Let's say you go and reevaluate everything and you've never worked with Mural for the things and have worked with Ledger Run. Like who's in your RFP? What vendors would you go out and say, hey, these are better than Medidata, it's better than SAP, who would be in that grouping?

**Former Vice President of Clinical Development at Karyopharm Therapeutics**
The list is going to be relatively expensive. The top 20 alternatives are expensive to RFP them. We're probably a unique company that, first, we RFI companies a lot. And that's how we extend our RFP list.

But if you would say who are the top five RFPs that we would review, Mural Health is definitely one of them. Ledger, Greenphire, G2 is another one potentially. If I look at other companies, InnaMed is another one that I'll be looking at.

But it depends on the timeline, and it depends on other things. I mean these companies, they're evolving themselves. Second, third Q of one year doesn't necessarily mean Q1 or Q2 of the next year. They don't have a newly adopted system.

By the way, almost everyone that we've been talking about, they're telling us that they're going to have machine learning and artificial intelligence involved for the report system, alerts and cost-containing

measures associated with the payment tracking. So I think it remains to be seen which one can give us the case study.

So one of the things that I'll be thinking about next year in March, when we're doing the KPC review, how effective they are in generative AI associated with the payment tracking. So things are evolving. So that's the reason I can't tell you who's going to be next year. But right now, until next year, we are where we are.

**Tegus Client**
But it sounds like, again, the shortlist we'll say is going to be Mural, Greenphire, Ledger Run and maybe G2.

**Former Vice President of Clinical Development at Karyopharm Therapeutics**
And InnaMed. It's a smaller company.

**Tegus Client**
In addition to just talking about payments and budgeting, is there any software that you use outside of what we talked about that is extremely helpful?

**Former Vice President of Clinical Development at Karyopharm Therapeutics**
So SAP has a very good accounting tracking software that we had to pay for extra which its job is projection. Right now, we are talking with the CFO to have systems to see who has a software that can do what we just said, alerts and tracking. But as far as the softwares are concerned, nothing that I could tell you besides the standard reporting systems that these tools they have themselves.

**Tegus Client**
And then going back, when you adopted Mural, did you also look at Ledger Run to perform what Mural is doing? Or do you think of them as two fundamentally different things?

**Former Vice President of Clinical Development at Karyopharm Therapeutics**
No, we evaluate them side by side.

**Tegus Client**
Where their main parameters that you compare them like cost, functionality?

**Former Vice President of Clinical Development at Karyopharm Therapeutics**
Yes. So it was pretty much the API amalgamation or proven track record in their API system. In other words, would they be able to API themselves quickly with the systems that we have in place. Number two is the cost, obviously. I shouldn't say it's a number two. The lowest hanging fruit is the functional capability of the API, ease of the use, ease of transformation. In other words, how quickly can we adapt to them.

And obviously, there's interfaceability that we were talking about. Last but not least is the type of the reports available, standard reports versus custom reports that we needed. So if you put all of them into the balance sheet of KPCs, that's the reason we went with Mural Health. But we did side-by-side review of the these, yes, of course.

**Tegus Client**
So was there any points given and taken like the Mural win, I counted six parameters, API, ease of use, ease of transformation, interfaceability, reporting, costs. Did they win outright?

**Former Vice President of Clinical Development at Karyopharm Therapeutics**
As far as the cost is concerned, they're relatively the same. So zero to 10, Mural would be about five, six. The other one is like six or seven or something like that. As far as interfaceability, Mural Health came pretty, I would say, at two times, if one is zero to 10, two or three, the other one is four to six type of thing.

I mean, we actually algorithmically put numbers to these conversations and we identify why and so on and so forth. That's because we have our own corporate integrity agreement sheets that we have to fill out, why this company versus the other company. We have our own challenges with the CFO. So I have to go back to those conversations that exactly out, but those are the top two that I could recall.

**Tegus Client**
So reporting and interfaceability were where Mural excelled and then the other four, cost was comparable.

**Former Vice President of Clinical Development at Karyopharm Therapeutics**
Yes. Seamless reporting, Mural Health came pretty good. I'm not saying three times, but probably 30%, 40% better because of the standard reporting that they have. And report generation, we have to look at the type of report generation, can we extract tracking associated with those report generations, the type of reports that they come out because that's an important venue.

How do we get these reports and how in-house we could analyze them over time and what important information we get? That's the reason Mural Health came out because if you look at their reports, Mural Health versus Ledger, you would see the type of reports that we get, we couldn't get that much of information out of Ledger's in to do good tracking, which is important to us. So they have a way to go on that front. These are all important things.

**Tegus Client**
And then what about ease of use and ease of transformation and their APIs?

**Former Vice President of Clinical Development at Karyopharm Therapeutics**
Well, API, we said Mural was about two to three times better because it worked with SAP easily, it worked with Medi seamlessly; it worked with Intuitive and QuickBooks that we do for payment process, plus or minus the SAP. Intuitively, no issues.

Ledger had some challenges with SAP, some challenges with Medi, which was interesting because they're all IBM systems or work on the same SQL IBM systems. We couldn't understand why they would have challenges. So that's as far as the API is concerned.

Ease of use, I would say, on the front end, they're all easy to use. It takes time for people to get used to the portal. But on the front end, I think they are the same. Not one of them is that much better than the other, at least that's what we thought.

**Tegus Client**
That's very helpful. I really appreciate the time. Enjoy the rest of your day.
