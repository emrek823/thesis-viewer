# RUNNING MEETING NOTES
## VIRTUE / SOLSTICE

### Updates:
1.  **Key business updates:**
    a.  **Agency Pipeline:**
        i.  **Weber Shandwick** (ARR: 831 million USD)
            1.  Presented a live demo with them and they're interested in moving forward. They'll inform us how many brands they'll want to work with and we'll send them a SLA right afterwards.
            2.  **Contract Value:** $100k/brand/year (est. brands to begin with: 2 brands)
        ii.  **Communications Partners Group** (ARR: 20.4 million USD)
            1.  Presented a live demo with them with one of their real documents and they're super excited about the platform. (10 slides had 373 annotations across 30 references totalling over 500 pages). They're going to review the document to compare it with the annotations their team made manually. If everything looks good, we'll send them an SLA.
            2.  **Contract Value:** $100k/brand/year (est. brands to begin with: 1-2 brands)
        iii. **ClinicalMind/IC Axon** (ARR: 20.4 million USD)
            1. Interested in moving forward with one of their organizations (IC Axon). We sent them an SLA for two brands to start.
            2. **Contract Value:** $200k/year (2 brands to start with)
        iv. **TJP** (ARR: 18.1 million USD)
            1. Had initial pitch with them. They're interested in the platform and will discuss it internally. Waiting to hear back to schedule a 2nd conversation with the broader team.
        v.  **Precision AQ** (ARR: 339 million USD)
            1.  Had initial pitch with them. They're interested in the platform and will discuss it internally. Waiting to hear back to schedule a 2nd conversation with the broader team.
        vi. **Ongoing:**
            1.  **MedTech Momentum:**
                a.  They're using the platform but don't think they're going to be the best partner given their size.
            2.  **DiD Agency:**
                a.  Still working with them to refine the claims grid tool. Will likely pitch them the MLR platform soon.
                b.  Heard back from them today. We're exploring a different use case related to compliance/MLR. This is good so we can refocus our efforts and not need to balance between working on the claims grid tool and the pre-MLR check tool.
        vii. **Waiting on hearing back:**
            1.  Fingerpaint Group (will get back to us this week), PRI Healthcare Communications, PIXACORE, Real Chemistry (OOO)
2.  **Product updates:**
    a.  **Pre-MLR Tool:**
        i.  Regulatory tool: We've been working on moving towards the agent approach vs. prompting approach which allows for greater consistency of regulatory flags we provide within a brand as well as greater accuracy.
        ii.  Annotations/fact checking: annotations are improving and are moving towards recursive retrieval instead of simple semantic search to allow us to identify ideas/phrases by similarity over pure matching.
    b.  **Future:**
        i.  As opposed to a static workflow, we want to build an experience that truly simulates a real MLR process, whereby Solstice becomes a true productivity & compliance copilot for teams and is used by editorial/account teams in parallel with current workflows.
3.  **Hiring updates:**
    a.  Identified a few candidates:
        i.  Jonathan Kim
        ii.  Arindam Sharma
        iii. Emre Onal
        iv. A bunch of other kids we are still chatting with. We're looking for high caliber candidates who are beasts both technically but also mentally

### Discussion:
1.  N/A - we're locked in right now

### Cash/Runway:
1.  Cash: $2,823,000
2.  Monthly Burn: $26,000
3.  Run Rate: 108 months

## 8/7/24

### Updates:
1.  **Key business updates:**
    a.  **Agency Pipeline:**
        i.  **MedTech Momentum:**
            1.  Their team created two brands: Nanovis & NovaBone to begin using the pre-MLR tool and create rules.
        ii.  **DiD Agency:**
            1.  Their team is using the platform and they are working with their clients to give us access to more proprietary data to train Solstice to begin generating promotional messages from claims. They seem to be excited about the potential of the claims generation platform.
        iii. **ClinicalMind**
            1.  Had a second demo with them and they are interested in trying it out for one of their brands. They will discuss with their team and get back to us with next steps on which brands they'd potentially like to begin with.
        iv. **Weber Shandwick**
            1.  Live demo scheduled with their team next Tuesday.
        v.  **NEW: Communications Partners Group**
            1.  Had a demo with their team and they expressed interest in licensing the platform.
            2.  Feedback on pricing: 5% of typical brand contract values was reasonable. So a $2mm brand contract would cost $100k annually, which was higher than our initial assumption of charging $100k annually for a $10mm brand contract. We need to still validate this pricing.
        vi. **NEW: TJP**
            1.  Scheduling demo with their team.
        vii. **NEW: PrecisionAQ**
            1.  Demo scheduled for next Monday.
        viii. **Fingerpaint Group**
            1.  Interested in the platform and using it for 1-2 brands to begin with. Planning on signing on NDA and scheduling the following meeting.
        ix. **Still waiting on hearing back from:**
            1.  PIXACORE, PRI Healthcare Communications, and Real Chemistry (OOO)
        x.  Here is a more comprehensive list of the organizations in our pipeline right now.
    b.  **Product updates:**
        i.  **Claims grid tool:**
            1.  We are building out capabilities to have the claims grid tool be able to push out claims segmented by outcomes and generate promotional messages out of these claims. There is also an opportunity here to allow users to prompt the system to extract specific information and interpretations from charts and and graphs. *Note that we're not prioritizing these new features and focusing on the pre-MLR tool.*
        ii.  **Pre-MLR tool:** Here is a new demo [video](video).
            1.  **Auto-annotations tool**
                a.  Annotations tool can now do MATH!
                b.  The system can now interpret tables as well.
                c.  Switched from traditional RAG to recursive retrieval and it seemed to really help outputs although still testing
            2.  **Regulatory tool**
                a.  We built out a custom rules-based engine to allow users to add specific rules for brands that they are working with. For both of these tools, we want to refine our accuracy of our suggestions as well as citations. Will require close work with client data from initial users.
    c.  **Hiring:**
        i.  We're going to trial run a comp sci major from Penn that we met a few weeks ago for the next two weeks. We have met him and given him a technical assessment already, which we were impressed with. The goal here is to evaluate his working style and see if he has the both the skills and mentality that we're looking for. Here is an overview of the [two-week trial](two-week%20trial).

### Discussion:
1.  Getting firms to convert: Many agencies are very close to converting and are interested in the product. How do we entice agencies to pull the trigger and be willing to partner with us? Posting more on LinkedIn.

### Cash/Runway:
1.  Cash: $2,836,000
2.  Monthly Burn: $26,000
3.  Run Rate: 109 months

### Notes:
*   Quantify the average contract values of each of the organizations
*   Quantify the value proposition, how to balance selling ahead and value proposition
*   They want to know that it is sophisticated but also secure
*   Reach out to Shubh and other founders who have sold to organizations

## 7/24/24

### Updates:
2.  **Key business updates:**
    a.  **Agency Pipeline:**
        i.  **MedTech Momentum:**
            1.  Gave their team access to the platform yesterday. Awaiting feedback from their team and more insight into
        ii.  **DiD Agency:**
            1.  Gave their team access to the platform. So far usage has been good and their team has provided us with some feedback to better structure and layout the claims that the system outputs.
        iii. **PIXACORE:**
            1.  We are still waiting on their response to schedule a live demo.
        iv. **Haymarket:**
            1.  PRI Healthcare Solutions (medical communications arm of Haymarket): In the process of signing an NDA
        v.  **Real Chemistry:**
            1.  Their team is out on vacation until mid-August so we are scheduling our the onboarding
        vi. **NEW: ClinicalMind**
            1.  Interested in the platform and using it for 1-2 brands to begin with. Planning on signing on NDA and scheduling the following meeting.
        vii. **NEW: Fingerpaint Group**
            1.  Interested in the platform and using it for 1-2 brands to begin with. Planning on signing on NDA and scheduling the following meeting.
        viii. **NEW: Weber Shandwick**
            1.  Interested in the platform. Scheduling a live demo with their team in New York in early August.
        ix. Here is a more comprehensive list of the organizations in our pipeline right now.
    b.  **Biopharma updates:**
        i.  So far:
            1.  AstraZeneca, Accord Biopharma are interested.
        ii.  Takeaways from conversations:
            1.  Our pitch to biopharma organizations needs to be more strategically positioned and we need to frame the value proposition more specifically to their organization (size, stage of brands).
            2.  They are more risk averse so typically would require us to validate the platform with metrics determined by real users. They are less likely to be the first adopters of technology. In addition, sales cycles are much longer with them. Finally, we would need to integrate with Veeva PromoMats in order to work with biopharma.
            3.  This is why our GTM strategy of serving agencies first is a great way to eventually demonstrate the tangible benefits of the platform using real data. We will build case studies off of this data to later sell to biopharma organizations. We will sell this solution as a productivity tool for biopharma organizations to 1) accelerate commercial timelines by streamlining regulatory review and 2) prevent FDA fines that can amount to more than $100m/fine for the promotion of misleading claims.
            4.  We are working with a biopharma exec (Elaine Kang) from SpringWorks Therapeutics who is interested in the product to come up with a list of generalizable regulatory flags that can be used across organizations (this is a good way to initially build a product that can scale before incorporating more nuanced rules)
                *   **Medical:**
                    *   No misleading claims
                *   **Regulatory:**
                    *   Prominence of safety information (through medium and visually)
                    *   Fair balance
    c.  **Product updates:**
        i.  **Claims grid tool:**
            1.  The product is live and is able to generate claims related to safety & efficacy results presented in papers. We are working on building out more interactive features to extract more specific information from tables and graphs:
        ii.  **Pre-MLR tool:**
            1.  **Auto-annotations tool**
                a.  The product is able to identify claims in promotional content and associate them with references. We need to perfect the actual citing of these sources to incorporate paragraph and line numbers.
            2.  **Regulatory tool**
                a.  The regulatory check is now embedded with the auto-annotations tool. We are working to develop a specific set of rules to train the model that can initially be adopted across agencies and biopharma organizations.

### Discussion:
2.  **Hiring:** Any ML ops individuals you would mind intro-ing us to? We'd love to have initial chats with them. We're looking for people with killer mindsets and grit over experience.
3.  **Product stack:** Consistency of LLM results? What do your portcos think about this issue? Mind connecting us with some product leads to asking questions about evaluating decisions.

### Cash/Runway:
4.  Cash: $2,847,000
5.  Monthly Burn: $26,000
6.  Run Rate: 109 Months

## 7/10/24

### Updates:
3.  **Key business updates:**
    a.  **Agency Pipeline:**
        i.  **MedTech Momentum:**
            1.  We've been given two brands to begin working with (NovaBone and NanoVis).
            2.  We're onboarding their team tomorrow (7/11)
        ii.  **DiD Agency:**
            1.  Officially onboarding the team to use the claims grid tool on 7/12
        iii. **PIXACORE:**
            1.  We are scheduling our live demo with them, which we expect to be early next week
        iv. **Haymarket:**
            1.  PRI Healthcare Solutions (medical communications arm of Haymarket): In the process of signing an NDA
            2.  Haymarket Media: We had a conversation with their media team on 7/8 to explore an opportunity to automate ad operations, specifically feeding media plans into servers. We're hesitant
        v.  **Real Chemistry:**
            1.  In the process of finalizing an NDA and scheduling a first onboarding meeting for the pre-MLR tool
        vi. **Upcoming pitches:**
            1.  ClinicalMind on 7/12
        vii. Here is a more comprehensive [list](list) of the organizations in our pipeline right now.
    b.  **Biopharma updates:**
        i.  We had some very helpful discussions with a few pharma companies. Some key takeaways:
            1.  An MLR (regulatory check tool) would have tremendous value for biopharma to:
                a.  Lower the chances of receiving any warning letters or fines from the FDA.
                b.  Manage the abundance of resources that are produced by creative agencies Resources expire after 1 year so MLR teams need to constantly re-approve material and specific changes and need a constant oversight of all the inventory.
                c.  Effectively manage the tracking of regulatory standards based on:
                    i.  Indications of a drug (many drugs have different indications and as a result different regulatory standards)
                    ii.  Target audience (patient, HCP, etc.)
                    iii. Additional requirements (i.e. from a Sunshine Act perspective)
            2.  Overall, biopharma benefits will benefit through a pre-MLR tool because it makes their process easy, scalable, compliant. The immediate next step is to quantify this value proposition for them.
            3.  The pre-MLR tool is split into two components: the annotations feature and a regulatory feature. We now realize they are two distinguishable features. Before, when biopharma expressed less interest, it was in reference to the annotations tool since agencies handle this work. However, a pre-MLR tool is very valuable for pharma companies.
                a.  There's a different value proposition for different stage pharma companies but there's equal applicability regardless of life cycle stage. The only difference is what they care about in this regulatory review (i.e. risk tolerance, what compliance requirements are important)
                    i.  For launch brands: speed to market is the biggest concern and as a result, they have higher risk tolerance and want to push out material faster as long as it aligns with the label. Solstice can add value here by accelerating review timelines.
                    ii.  For mature brands: consistency with FDA label (CFL) is important so they want to ensure that promotional material meets the regulatory requirements made by their own brand teams and prior feedback from the FDA through previous content submission. They have more specific requirements and are more risk averse but don't need to push out content faster. Solstice can add value here by providing more accurate and personalized suggestions.
        ii.  **Upcoming conversations:**
            1.  Pitch with AstraZeneca (2nd discussion)
            2.  Initial conversations with Otsuka Pharmaceuticals, Tris Pharma
    c.  **Product updates:**
        i.  We've been heavily focusing on pushing out the product given the upcoming onboarding sessions (claims grid generation for DiD Agency & pre-MLR tool for PIXACORE and MTM).
        ii.  **Claims Generation Tool** is close to completion – just getting the appropriate annotations for each claim has proven difficult because LLMs are not very good at this
        iii. **Reg Check + Annotations Tool** is coming along and should be ready for a rough launch by EOW with MTM. Definitely still a WIP as we're struggling to get consistency with the reg check recommendations being provided but we're going to get it into their hands and get their feedback

### Discussion:
1.  Time constrained with the ability to push out and handle multiple products (claims grid & pre-MLR tools) for separate organizations. We believe these two products are what we want to focus on but it is challenging to balance given the disparate needs of the organizations we're working with.
2.  Given the above, as soon as we sign a contract, we want to begin the hiring process for a full-time engineer. How do we balance the need to find someone quickly as we begin scaling the product across an organization and as the load will increase with finding the right person? Are contractors a potential interim solution?

### Cash/Runway:
7.  Cash: $2,860,000
8.  Monthly Burn: $26,000
9.  Run Rate: 111 Months

## 6/26/24

### Updates:
4.  **Key business updates:**
    a.  **Overall updates:**
        i.  We have realized that we want to stop asking for a paid "design partnership." We will sell the solution as is since the product is almost production ready. Strong, engaged early customers will be better partners than if we frame it as a design partnership.
        ii.  **GTM:** Initially serve agencies to sell a compliance/pre-MLR tool. Eventually enter into content creation to help generate claims. Using this framework, sell the content creation platform to biopharma.
    b.  **Agency Pipeline:**
        i.  **MedTech Momentum:** Beginning partnership and will explore an initial pre-MLR tool. Our concern with this partnership is that the agency is fairly small and it seems like they are more interested in the idea of using AI to sell to more clients than being strong design partners. We want strong initial customers. If we don't see the value in a collaboration with them, we will end it.
        ii.  **DiD Agency:** Signed an initial pilot program agreement to build out a series of features over the course of 6 weeks. Since we established a relationship with them earlier on in our journey, we have agreed to a pilot program with their content creation team. Here is a list of the [features](features). We're hoping to leverage this initial relationship we established with them to sell a fully fleshed out solution after the pilot.
        iii. **PIXACORE:**
            1.  We pitched the idea to their team and they are interested in adopting our pre-MLR solution and initially use it for a new brand deal they signed worth $7mm. We quoted them at $75,000 per year for that deal and they were happy with the price point. We're scheduling a live demo with their team.
        iv. **Vivanti:** Decided to pause and circle back with them given that we want to focus on the US market initially
        v.  **Haymarket:**
            1.  PRI Healthcare Solutions (medical communications arm of Haymarket):
                a.  They are interested in having us build a functional annotations platform to be able to annotate
            2.  Haymarket Media:
                a.  We are having a conversation with their media team on 7/8 to explore an opportunity to automate ad operations, specifically feeding media plans into servers.
        vi. **Real Chemistry:** We are beginning to work with one of their market access marketing teams to use the pre-MLR tool. Finalizing the details of this partnership right now.
        vii. Here is a more comprehensive [list](list) of the organizations in our pipeline right now.
    c.  **Biopharma updates:**
        i.  **Pre-MLR tool:** Upon having conversations with marketing people at biopharma companies, it seems like they are divided in their opinions on having a pre-MLR tool. Most of them believe that an agency would benefit more from it. If an agency uses this platform and sells them a service that uses Solstice to auto-annotate claims and provide a regulatory check, they would be more inclined to go with that agency since it would be less expensive. Pharma companies are price sensitive because agencies are expensive. One pretty good lead for this tool - [Elaine Kang](Elaine%20Kang) at Springwork Therapeutics
        ii.  **Content creation tool:** They seem to be more excited about a content creation tool since it helps them completely replace an agency's work. Specifically, they are interested in a platform that would help them build out a full claims document and segment the claims based on input variables and customer behaviors (exactly what we proposed as Solstice's content creation model). For one pharma company (small early stage pharma called Axsome Tx with two commercial-stage assets), it would save them 6 months prior to launch and over $1mm of marketing costs per drug.
    d.  **Product updates:**
        1.  Integrations with Veeva and product management systems (Workfront, Ziflow) likely will be needed to scale

### Discussion:
3.  **Prioritizing product development.** We've already decided we wanted to focus our efforts on our pre-MLR check tool as an initial wedge to sell to agencies. How do we balance the need to maintain our relationship with agencies who we pitched a content creation platform so that we can upsell them later and our need to focus on developing our core solution right now (pre-MLR check tool)? How should we respond to additional asks especially from bigger agencies given limited dev capacity at the moment?

### Cash/Runway:
10. Cash: $2,874,000
11. Monthly Burn: $26,000
12. Run Rate: 111 Months

## 6/12/24

### Updates:
1.  **Key business updates:**
    a.  **Pipeline:**
        i.  **MedTech Momentum:** just signed a design partnership that converts to a paid contract.
            1.  $2000/brand/month to begin with -> the actual price point is subject to change as we work with more of their brands and redefine the scope
        ii.  **Vivanti:** will begin onboarding next Monday. Waiting on signing a contract.
        iii. **DiD Agency:** verbally agreed to move forward with a paid design partnership.
        iv. **Haymarket Media:** verbally agreed to move forward with a design partnership to build out a functional annotation platform.
        v.  **Calcium & PIXACORE:** Scheduled next steps conversation to discuss use cases.
        vi. Here is a more comprehensive [list](list) of the organizations in our pipeline right now.
    b.  **Speaking to biopharma companies** as well to get a sense of the appetite for adoption. What is interesting is that smaller biopharma companies don't have defined MLR processes and teams so they rely a lot on agencies to help them out here. Solstice has the potential to add value to help agencies generate more $$ if we sell to agencies and add value to biopharma companies by helping them evaluate content, reduce fines, and accelerate the time to getting their content out.
    c.  **The fact check process** typically requires two people and on average is $20k for 1 detail aid (~30-40 slide PowerPoint). For an entire slide deck, they are given $125k and 15% is spent on fact checking (~20k)
        i.  $250-300/hr for a strategy person and $500/hr for a PharmD/PhD
        ii.  ~27 combined hours is spent on fact checking.
        iii. If we can cut it to 2.7 hours then it would cost them only $2k and hence $18k of savings. We can charge them $2k for one detail aid.
2.  **Key product updates:**
    a.  We'll be focusing initially on developing a platform to automate annotations and the fact check process for brands.
    b.  In the future, we'll build out capabilities to generate promotional content and segment messages and enter into the media (next-best actions) space. Right now, we want to focus on one singular thing and perfect it.
    c.  Here is a [demo](demo) of the new version of the product.

### Discussion:
1.  **Growing the team:**
    a.  We're not ready to grow immediately but we need to begin the process of searching for candidates. We want to be ready to grow quickly if/when we convert more agencies, we would want to be able to deploy a more scalable product and push out features faster.
    b.  How should we approach this?
2.  **Measuring value prop:**
    a.  We will work with initial customers to write out case studies to measure the value prop. Ideally we convert both brands as well as agencies so we can measure the value prop from both sides.
    b.  Are there any other ways we can do this?

### Cash/Runway:
1.  Cash: $2,890,000
2.  Monthly Burn: $26,000
3.  Run Rate: 112 Months

### Action Items:
1.  4-5 deck with the new vision
    a.  Executie Vision:
    b.  Here is our GTM
*   What is the actual TAM on the Agency side?
*   What does that equate to?
*   Biopharma companies have goals to sell drugs
*   So many silos to
*   Margins for these agencies

## 5/28/24

### Updates:
1.  We've progressed along with many additional agencies:
    a.  Have an in-person meeting with the executive team with Haymarket Media Group later today. Had two great meetings with the President of Medical Affairs thus far. They are massive ($750M ARR). We can go over presentation live during this meeting
    b.  **Medtech Momentum** has verbally agreed to a design partnership and we've sent them an agreement (still negotiating specific price point but will be a % of brand budget per brand)
    c.  **Meeting with executive team of PIXACORE** on Thursday to go over design partnership details ($20M ARR)
    d.  **In-person meeting with CMO of DiD** on Friday ($50M ARR)
    e.  Here is a [list](list) of the individuals/organizations in our pipeline
2.  **Product is well underway** – here is a functioning demo.
    a.  **Pre-MLR Check:** should be ready for live users in the next week.
    b.  **Creating a claims grid (via dashboard)** (Still wip)
    c.  **Creating a claims grid (via email)** (Still wip)
3.  **Pricing**
    a.  We will charge agencies a fee per brand, as a % of overall brand spend. Average brand spend is roughly $10M. Agencies generally get 10-20% of this – we'd look to grab 2-5%. ~$200-500k for full-stack per brand, less for just MLR.
4.  **Vision of the product** is to initially start as a compliance checker for marketing teams, then work upstream to handle content creation before handling content activation.

### Platform Overview
We provide the guardrails to accelerate the content creation process.

**Solstice AI Engine**

| :------------------------------ | :------------------------------ | :------------------------------ | :------------------------------ |
| **Aa** Pre-medical legal review check | Automated content generation    | Interpreting media plans        | Recommending next-best actions  |
| Identify components that don't meet requirements of client legal teams prior to MLR process. | Extract relevant data from sources such as to generate messages and assemble personalized content. | Automate the ingestion and interpretation of media plans into ad platforms. | Recommending next-best actions based on measurement data from ad campaigns. |

We review content, generate personalized content, ingest media plans to ad platforms, and recommend next-best actions to accelerate campaigns and compliance cycles.

### Discussion:
1.  In our conversation with the President of Medical Affairs of Haymarket, he asked us to present what a partnership with the agency would look like and how could the agency benefit if they help us design/fine-tune the solution. Are there any important factors here that we should consider? Some ideas initially are:
    a.  Design partnership with exclusive early partner rates
    b.  Licensing royalty for top 10 competitors
    c.  Equity investment
2.  How should we balance presenting a vision of the full-stack solution vs just the MLR solution which is what we are starting with.

### Cash/Runway:
4.  Cash: $2,910,000
5.  Monthly Burn: $25,000
6.  Run Rate: 117 Months

### Comps:
*   It is a type of pitch that you see less of
*   Generaliss – CDP platforms like LiveRamp, Jasper
*   Healthcare DOmain Expertise – need to have instead of nice to have
*   Compliance

## 5/14/24

### Updates:
1.  We've pitched Solstice now to CEO of Vivanti, CEO of Skittle Media, SVP of Fingerpaint, CEO + CSO at RevHealth, SVPs at Calcium, SVP at Haymarket, SVP at DiD, CTO at CMI
    a.  Also been talking directly to VPs of marketing in Biopharma/Biotech but reception has been mostly that we'd need to be full-service for adoption - otherwise should serve
2.  Here's the [concept note](concept%20note) we're using and here's a short [demo](demo) we've been showing to demonstrate some of the core features of the platform
    a.  Creating a claims grid (via dashboard): [https://youtu.be/GQJ_hVUU3bk](https://youtu.be/GQJ_hVUU3bk)
    b.  Creating a claims grid (via email): [https://youtu.be/VBYNDX2Pdx8](https://youtu.be/VBYNDX2Pdx8)
        i.  Additional demos added on to the original dashboard as requested by DiD Agency
3.  Vivanti has agreed to serve as a design partner, and RevHealth ($58M ARR), Fingerpaint, ($176M) Calcium ($45M ARR), DiD ($48M ARR), and CMI ($253M) all are interested in working together, they are going to discuss internally before proceeding. Bigger players are worried about integrations with their current workflow.
4.  Big picture: Chatted with Director of Product and Strategy at Lasso, VP of Sales at Compile, former employee @ Lasso / now Purple Lab
    a.  **Sam @ Lasso**
        i.  likes personalized content creation angle – although sees need to integrate with ad platforms to be truly meaningful cuz no one wants to add a new platform to their workflow
        ii.  Lasso plays no part in content, it's just not their core competency, brands give them content and NPIs they'd like to target and then they run the ads.
        iii. Lasso is not a DSP – they are built on top of AppNexus which is a DSP which allowed them to be way cheaper than DeepIntent/PulsePoint and also scale quickly. (But doesn't seem like there's any real tech moat?)
        iv. Tapping into experimental budgets/end-of-life brand budgets
        v.  He's down for weekly/biweekly convos if needed (great content to keep - has a great technical understanding of the space)
        (Our thought: Content Creation is top of the funnel for marketing teams. If we become the trusted platform for this, we earn the right for us to go downstream to DSPs since user experience would be exponentially better if Solstice can dynamically adjust and publish content all-in-one platform and make changes on the fly - you don't get that ability with Lasso because all new copy needs to be hand over so options are inherently limited)
    b.  **Norman + Isabelle:** Data vendor space is super crowded – most players have shitty economics. Content personalization can have a lot of value especially for specialty drugs and end-of-life brands. Question will be how we differentiate and create a moat around the business since lots of agencies + biopharma are looking to build some of this stuff out.

### Discussion:
*   How do we gauge nice-to-have vs. must-have? Reception has been really positive so far - super easy for us to get in-touch with C-suite at top marketing agencies, follow-ups happen right away, people asking about pricing – but is this just because they watched a webinar about AI/marketing or is it a deeper desire?
    *   Relatedly, how should we structure design partnerships so we get a real sense of WTP?
*   How big can this be? We still need to think through this. The biggest healthcare marketing agency does $500M ARR. Clearly more spend occurring in the space in the near/long-term due to transition to digital ads and we'd be higher margin than competitors but still not the best-case scenario we want to aim for.

### Cash/Runway:
1.  Cash: $2,925,000
2.  Monthly Burn: $25,000
3.  Run Rate: 118 Months
*   Milestones - crafting up milestones for each month

## 5/1/24

### Updates:
1.  We like the biopharma commercialization market – we've found that stakeholders (biopharma marketing teams, marketing agencies) are easy to engage, open to innovation, and willing to purchase tools that help sell more medications.
    a.  Veeva is really good, it seems like. We don't want to do anything that directly competes with one of their core competencies or tries to build an incrementally better version of one of their products.
    b.  There is a trend away from in-person detailing towards digital targeting for HCPs + providers. We're hoping to capitalize on this trend.
    c.  We like the idea of serving biopharma market agencies – they have money (many do $100MM+ ARR), there are lots of them, they have relationships with biopharma and are willing to adopt solutions. DSPs like Lasso and DeepIntent that serve them have found great success.
2.  We have further refined the idea as a tool specifically for life sciences marketing agencies to expedite the process of generating and reviewing compliant content. Here is a brief [concept note](concept%20note) to explain the product. We're not bound to this but it is where we've seen most interest from this customer demographic so far.
    *   The problem we are looking to address is the stumbling block that agencies have in transitioning data about a drug or asset into a claim being made, which largely depends on being able to use the right language. We provide the guardrails for marketing teams to understand what is and what is not approved language based on prior approved data from client legal teams, ultimately helping them save an absorbent amount of time and client dollars during the medical legal review cycles. Another aspect of the tool is generating languages tailored to demographics preferences such as 1) understanding the patient/HCP entry point in their journey and 2) understanding what is important for a patient/HCP (access, education) and then targeting these demographics based on these aspects.
    *   Several tailwinds allow this to happen now:
        1)  arrival of personalized medicine.
        2)  Crossix, Lasso, DeepIntent make it possible to rapidly find and target the right HCPs and patients but there is a need to match the personalized targeting to messaging to actually drive engagement and conversion.
3.  We have spoken to many agencies including Heller Agency, Havas Health, Digital Elevator, Deerfield Agency, Calcium & Co.
    *   Digital Elevator and Calcium ($50M ARR) have expressed interest in serving as design partners for the tool. We're having follow-up discussions with both parties.

### Discussion:
*   We are still trying to figure out what our unique insight here is. What are some strategies we can use in our conversations to help us arrive at this insight?

### Cash/Runway:
4.  Cash: $2,940,500
5.  Monthly Burn: $25,000
6.  Run Rate: 118 Months

### Notes:
*   Could we drive a more coordinated effort across marketing teams?
*   Integrating with specialty pharmacies, distributors, manufacturers? Can we cut out distributors?
*   Amount of publicly available information:
    *   Compile (McKesson acquired them) has provider addresses
    *   Price transparency data
    *   Commoditized data that can be used
*   After targeting:
    *   How do you know they will be activated?
    *   How will you know that they will drive more prescriptions?
*   If we do that, so what? How does this match up with our view of how the world is changing in 3-5 years?
    *   Loss of exclusivity of drugs that biopharma is seeing is massive
    *   Importance to engage with providers to keep prescribing certain drugs
*   Keep speaking to the people like Grace:
    *   To get understanding of where the market is headed
*   Manufacturers want to cut out distributors.
*   Have a view on.
*   Compile
    *   McKesson – [https://www.compile.com/newsroom/compile-is-now-part-of-mckesson/](https://www.compile.com/newsroom/compile-is-now-part-of-mckesson/)
*   Price Transparency Data is changing
    *   Definitive Healthcare/other data is becoming commoditized
*   How do you know someone will activate this?
    *   Throw something out of that
    *   Lasso
*   Okay so what?
    *   If accomplish this first goal – how does it align with how this world is changing?
    *   Loss of exclusivity with how world is changing is massive
    *   Way you engage providers will change massively
*   McKesson - Oncology: targeting providers. Engage the provider with content in this world.
    *   The way that looks is entirely different
    *   One year, two year post launch, Loss of Exlcusivity in the world.
*   How is this going to change
*   It probably matters what the provider wants to hear - use content generation to get in hands of providers and see what their preferences are.
*   Emre likes text and all of that is deidentified
*   Empiricus is doing well because provider's open their texts.
*   Focus on the undercurrent at the end of the teams
*   What else would you like within those data assets?
*   Get 5 or 10 different experts in the industry.
    *   Taking each insight internalizing it – this other 20% we are getting to.

    *   Start the journey at th

## 4/16/24

### Updates:
*   We have been exploring a few ideas. Feel free to browse over [here](here).
*   We have narrowed it down to exploring ways to help biopharma better direct their marketing efforts using AI. The basic idea is that we will gather data to help biopharma target their marketing efforts so that they can personalize messaging to the right physicians and patients. We need to generate unique, proprietary data for this to work.
*   The current method that we propose gathering information is through pharma sales reps by helping transcribe conversations and generate summaries, and suggestions on how to improve their conversations.
*   We created a landing page [here](here) and are scheduling calls with individuals at pharmaceutical companies to learn more about how they currently gather and use data to target specific patient demographics for their assets.
*   We've had a few preliminary pharma conversations (not with key DMers yet though) and the feedback has been that more unique data is always better for targeting and there's always a market for this. Incentives are also theoretically aligned with sales reps because better targeting = more revenue
*   We-ve talked to a few sales reps and reactions have been mixed – some worry about liability, others have more emotional reactions about AI replacing their jobs
*   While we're not bound to this idea, we're going to anchor this problem space as we believe it's a large market with plenty of money to go around if we find a meaningful solution.

### Discussion:
*   **How do we prevent any liability risk for manufacturers?**
    *   Our proposal is that we dictate the text without permanently storing it, only to store generated summaries of conversations and suggestions to improve.
    *   Pharmaceutical manufacturers can personalize the platform to toggle between what they'd want and what they don't want to be stored so that each dashboard will store information relevant to what manufacturers care about.
*   **How do we validate the market prior to building an MVP?**
    *   We are planning on meeting with as many biopharma individuals as possible to gauge interest and also speak with pharma sales representatives to understand information that is worth/valuable to collect for them and their manufacturers. If we get enough verbal interest and conviction after these conversations, we will go about designing/building the MVP.
*   **How do we leverage our conversations with biopharma to find adjacent ideas with potentially more potential?**
    *   Having an initial launching point is helpful to set-up conversations and start conversations with pharma stakeholders. However, we understand that this isn't likely to be where we end and want to leverage our conversations to find potentially more promising adjacencies.

### Updates:
1.  As referenced in the investor update, we're also having conversations with biopharma to explore the potential value of data that we can gather from providers and determine 1) what exact data would biopharma want and 2) the willingness to pay for this information.
    a.  Are we speaking to J Hirsch about this later this week but he brought up some challenges we'll likely face with this.
2.  **Main Point:** Inspired by our conversation last time, we have been exploring an out-of-the-box [idea](idea) we're excited to share with you. We would appreciate as much feedback as possible.

## 3/20/24 Meeting

### Updates:
1.  We are moving away from selling software to independent providers.
    a.  While we've identified a number of problems these providers face, we haven't identified a single hair-on-fire problem that would result in signing 6 figure contracts across enough of them to create a massive company
    b.  This is based on both anecdotal evidence from our conversations with providers as well as an analysis of the current market
        i.  **Anecdotal**
            1.  Point-solutions like biosimilars selection seemed appealing to many providers but not appealing enough for them to pull the trigger on purchasing. As IVX put it, “ We'd decide on bolt-on solutions like Solstice after first deciding on core infrastructure like our EMR and PCM"
            2.  During our visit at US Oncology – the team showed us solutions they are "piloting" such as FastAuth which they've been testing for >1 year without adoption despite seeming value add. Hundreds of companies like this that have been around >5+ years with nothing to show for it.
        ii.  **Market:**
            1.  Unlimited Systems, which is the clear dominant player in specialty PCM (2/3rds of community oncology use them, ½ of rheumatology, many infusion clinics like IVX, does full-stack RCM as well) does $21M in ARR after 2 decades of business. Any point solution serving the same market would have to be a fraction of that.
    c.  We've also pitched large health systems in the last few weeks including Penn Med and Northwell
        i.  Spoke with the [CRO of Northwell](CRO%20of%20Northwell) who seemed ambivalent about the biosimilar solution. He described his three largest pain-points (all related to RCM) and the 2-3 startups they are piloting for each of those pain points. While there is certainly pain and room for innovation here, there is marginal differentiation and significant competition for these small verticals – we'd prefer to focus on areas with larger room to run and more potential to differentiate.
2.  We're excited about the potential for AI to augment certain non-direct care verticals that adds clear ROI to patients and stakeholders who have a higher willingness to pay.
    a.  We're currently testing an SMS-based care assistant for older populations that has context about their medical history and can provide guidance for condition maintenance and escalate to providers when needed. Here's the [website](website).
        i.  We believe the ability for AI to develop context from a user's prior records as well as their past interactions with the patient has the potential to give it a truly unique understanding of the patient
        ii.  We previously built an SMS-based service for older populations during COVID that saw pretty good use so have some experience with this modality
        iii. We believe this could be sold direct-to-consumer (family members often serve as caregivers which is difficult with full-time jobs. Solstice would help offload their responsibilities) as well as to MA plans (if patients don't get questions answered they go to ER instead, racking up expense)
        iv. We've built a quick MVP that uses RAG + GPT and we've begun reaching out to health plans to gauge demand. Will begin DTC outreach on free channels as well.
    b.  We also see application to the general population with chronic diseases, however want to test on this population first due to higher disease burden and larger propensity to seek care.
    c.  We believe there is a clear market if tech can create good engagement. Companies like Papa show plans will adopt if patients like the solution and national caregiver shortage demonstrates pain-point. Question is if the target user will actually engage with chatbot/AI. Challenges will be:
        i.  Engaging patients
        ii.  Clearly striking the balance of not providing care and preventing patients from seeing provider when necessary

### Discussion Questions:
1.  How can we test the market/WTP for this product without committing to building out a full-fledged solution?
2.  Relatedly – how can we get MVP into the hands of potential users to see if there is any potential for adoption?
3.  Thoughts/strategies to sell into insurance/MA plans?

### Cash/Runway:
a.  Cash: $2,978,867
b.  Monthly Burn: ~$25,000
c.  Monthly Revenue: $2,600
d.  Run Rate: 130 months

*   Develop a unique understanding/perspective of what pharma or payer actually needs
*   Don't drive a conversation based on a high level market but a unique insight about the market to drive forward about.

## 3/5/24 Meeting

### Updates:
1.  We've talked to/visited 20+ community practices this month, pitching an AI-platform to automate back office-workflows.
2.  We've been pitching a suite of AI tools to automate back-office tasks including our current records retrieval platform and have been iterating our offerings based on where interest is clear.
    a.  We've seen the most interest from Ambulatory Infusion Centers like [IVX Health](IVX%20Health) ($100M ARR, raised $100M last year)
        i.  We had a sales call with the Senior VPs of RCM, Operations, and AIC Ops. This is the [demo](demo) we presented. We proposed taking over their intake process so that Solstice: 1. handles incoming referral faxes and extracts patient demographics 2. pulls relevant prior records through our platform 3. Recommends the ideal biosimilar.
        ii.  They were engaged in the conversation but are currently deciding on all core infrastructure so won't decide on "bolt-on infrastructure" until at least the next month
            1.  Really liked the fax OCR and biosimilars features which they said none of the vendors they've talked to thus far are offering
            2.  Proposed $500/month/location (would be $600k ACV if we served all their locations)
        iii. Size of market is a concern for us as is willingness to pay from some of the smaller providers that don't have the size of IVX
3.  Simultaneously, we're trying to engage with biopharma to understand whether or not the biosimilars data we would be collecting would be valuable. Some examples of data we are presenting them that we would be able to collect are:
    a.  Complete referral history between specialists
    b.  Complete medical history (i.e. current and past diagnoses, treatment history, medication history, genetic markers)
    c.  Drug administration patterns of physicians between different biosimilar options
    d.  Key factors behind physician drug prescribing decisions (extracted through progress notes)
    e.  Practice-specific distributor rates of biological drugs

### Discussion Items:
1.  How do we evaluate willingness to pay effectively in the first call instead of waiting for a final sales call like we did for IVX?
2.  How should we evaluate the size of the market while understanding that the product will evolve? (Even if we convert IVX at $600k, there's not too many players like them)
3.  How do we balance providing an integrated solution that would have a higher WTP (like the one we proposed) without having to perform a bunch of different operations (i.e. prior auth, records retrieval, pre-claims filing checklist, etc.)?

### Cash/Runway:
e.  Cash: $2,990,000
f.  Monthly Burn: $25,000
g.  Monthly Revenue: $2,600
h.  Run Rate: 130 months

*   Specialty Networks
*   Retrospective analysis for providers
    *   Focus on low-level focus
*   Rheumatology hate white bagging
*   Humira is 20% on medical benefit

## 2/20/24 Meeting

### Updates:
*   **Outreach/Learning Updates:**
    *   Built out demos for the following products:
        *   Automated referral management:
            *   Process new patients, create patient charts, retrieve relevant records, intelligently triage patients, and send automatic updates to patients about the status of their appointment.
        *   Biosimilars selection (no voiceover but will explain)
            *   Automate optimal selection of drugs and biosimilars based on ASP, purchasing price, reimbursement of drugs, and specific patient insurance plan coverage.
        *   Patient assistance matching (no voiceover but will explain)
            *   Identify and match patients to medication assistance programs, handling the process with patients and grant issuers (both manufacturer and NGO) from beginning to end
*   **Outreach/Learning Updates:**
    *   Here are a document that summarizes our feedback:
        *   [Major Summary of Takeaways from Visits/Meetings](Major%20Summary%20of%20Takeaways%20from%20Visits/Meetings)
    *   **To summarize:**
        *   We've narrowed out the top three products from a list of 6 products that we found interest in
        *   We are most excited about the biosimilars selection tool for the following reasons:
            *   Received positive feedback from a lot of providers we spoke to (ambulatory infusion centers & office infusion centers) including two large infusion chains (IVX Health + Alera Care)
            *   Value prop is tied to revenue (exact $$ is still a question we will answer)
            *   We believe the value of data beyond generating revenue for providers is greater (still need to validate this by speaking to pharma). Examples of data include: prescription patterns, which biosimilars are covered by insurance plans, reimbursement rates for brand drugs compared to biosimilars on a per patient basis
        *   Tailwinds with explosion in biosimilar adoption + movement towards infusions in outpatient settings
    *   **Things to focus on:**
        *   Build out working MVP for IVX Health & Alera Care in 2 weeks.
            *   IVX Health wants to see a demo for an integration with UF
        *   Continue having discussions with potential customers – specifically focused on infusion based practices

### Cash/Runway:
*   Cash: $2,994,000
*   Monthly Burn: $28,500
*   Monthly Revenue: $2,600
*   Run Rate: 115.6 months

*   Specialty pharmacy feeds is the biggest data need
*   Partnering with individual specialty pharmacies
*   Pharmacy feeds is a lot of value
*   Ashley Odom - keywell.ai
*   Sean can put us in touch with Atlas – patient assistance matching

## 2/07/24 Meeting

### Updates:
*   **Outreach/Learning Updates:**
    *   Sierra Hematology Oncology signed a contract of $500 per month and are planning an in-person onboarding this week. Our goal is to build a strong relationship with them through our current records retrieval solution and create a testing ground for new features.
    *   Our goal is to get **high quality feedback from top leaders in the industry** and as a result have reached out to practices (across specialties focusing on ones who earn a lot through drug reimbursement) and hospitals to get broader feedback on a hair on fire problem:
        1.  Visited Maryland Oncology and spent time with their entire team to learn about different aspects of the revenue cycle. Here are our [notes](notes) (starting on page 4). We are also scheduling a visit with the US Oncology Regional Business Office in Virginia to learn how they manage medical benefits billing.
        2.  Pitched [MDCS Dermatology](MDCS%20Dermatology) on a RCM tool and scheduling an in-person visit to conduct a comprehensive diagnostic to learn more about the challenges they face.
        3.  Conducting in-person visits with (we will be trying to visit and spend as much time with practices/health systems as possible):

*   **Product Updates:**
    *   **New Patient Intake Tool for OOS:** We are working with the OOS IT team to build out an automated intake tool for them that digests inbound faxes and creates a chart in Unlimited Systems.
        1.  This is not that much of a priority for us as based on the feedback we've received, referral management doesn't seem like a hair on fire pain point.
    *   **Back-Office Automation Demos:** we are building out skeleton demos for 4 main features that we've narrowed down to. This will help us get conversations started when we pitch to practices. It frames the conversation appropriately and allows us to narrow down on key challenges.
        1.  **Claims Intelligence Tool:** Analyze previous denials by scanning through PM software and flag PAs that have a chance of not being approved based on historics + current insurance policy.
        2.  **Medication Assistance Program Matching:** automating identifying and handling the process of obtaining grants from pharma companies, copay foundations, and state orgs – without these patients owe large OOP costs that they likely won't pay so they default ([article about patient experience](article%20about%20patient%20experience))
        3.  **Biosimilars Selection Tool:** identify preferred medications and provide suggestions on other biosimilars to prescribe (from an insurance preference perspective & cost for practice perspective)
        4.  **Documentation Copilot:** highlighting elements of a progress note that needs clarification to increase chances of reimbursement
*   **Discussion Points:**
    *   How do we structure initial conversations so that we can learn about broader needs while still showing them something since most people want a demo?
    *   How do we simultaneously pursue ideas that we see potential in?
    *   How should define the KPIs needed to commit to a direction/decide to build out a product?
*   **Cash/Runway**
    *   Cash: $3,008,265.05
    *   Monthly Burn: $27,123
    *   Monthly Revenue: $2100
    *   Run Rate: 122.7 Months

## 1/24/24 Meeting

### Updates:
*   **Outreach/Pilot Updates:**
    *   Pitched Astera two weeks ago. Seemed fine on the price point, they said they'd need to discuss it with their management team.
        1.  Have followed up/called a few times since, no response
    *   Have initial call with demo with Northwest Rheumatology based in Portland later today
    *   Alabama Oncology Set up time with Chris next Monday which we will use to go over other solutions (discussed below) since he doesn't really seem to care about records retrieval
    *   Received a warm intro to [Dr. Gelfand](Dr.%20Gelfand), founder of American Infusion Centers - who gave us some candid feedback on his take on the records retrieval problem. (tldr he thinks adoption will be difficult)
        1.  Also raised a question about community oncology practices as a customer segment in general (Discussion Below)
*   **Product Updates:**
    *   **Automated patient intake workflow for OOS:**
        1.  Had a call with Traci today on automating patient intake workflow for OOS. (will update after call)
            *   We're going to start auto-populating patient's on their dashboard directly as soon as a fax comes in.
            *   Traci mentioned triaging patients to determine when they should be scheduled is especially a problem because new patient coordinators don't have a lot of data to work with.
    *   **Claims Intelligence Tool for Oncology Medications:**
        1.  Nicole from Maryland, Traci from OOS and Chris from Maryland have all expressed that their single biggest problem is administering a drug after receiving prior auth and then having claims be denied either because they a. didn't provide sufficient evidence b. Administered drug not in formulary. Lose hundreds of thousands of dollars on this annually.
        2.  Created a [demo](demo) for initial pass at solution that we will pitch to Chris on 1/29 and share with other cancer centers we schedule calls with
        3.  Concerns here are: a. Competitive landscape b. Market Size
            *   Pharmacy Benefit electronic prior authorization – more automated than medical benefits.
            *   Pharmacy Benefit – will do the white-bagging and then
            *   Medical Benefit vs Pharmacy Benefit
            *   JCode - Buy and Bill for Medical Benefit.
            *   Pharmacy Benefit - Oral Oncolytics
            *   340b - Safety net hospitals can drugs at a steep benefit
            *   Something just changed to describe a 340b patient. If a patient every step – get reimbursed
            *   Specialty pharmacy – GI, Rheumatology
            *   Product, End-Customer, GTM Strategy
    *   **HCC tool for VBC practices:**
        1.  Here's the final version of the [case study](case%20study).
        2.  Outreach to ACOs across the country to explore how we can identify additional HCC scores for their patients. We have email sequences to set up these calls.
        3.  Concerns are that we haven't talked to many ACOs so problem statement needs validation
*   **GTM: Goal of getting 5 more Traci's:**
    1.  **Strategy:**
        *   Utilizing existing relationships: using Alabama Oncology, OOS, and Maryland Oncology as testing grounds to build out new tools specifically for these practices with the goal of converting them on these new value-adds ASAP.
        *   Outreach for new ideas: outreach in parallel to cancer centers (small and large) to get a sense of what the appetite is for the claims intelligence tool. We have calls in place with people from MD Anderson Cancer Center and Mayo Clinic currently but are trying to set up more calls with both community practices and other larger cancer centers.
        *   Lining up in-person meetings with locations with the goal of piloting the new tool by mid February.
*   **Discussion Points Company Direction**
    1.  **Product:** Given response from oncology practices, we think records retrieval is not enough of a value proposition to get the adoption needed to be a massive business. It's hard for them to justify another line item when margins are already thin. Either:
        a.  we figure out a better value proposition that generates them revenue or
        b.  explore new customer segments or both
    2.  **Market:** Ensuring that the product addresses a need beyond just community oncology. We believe community oncology should be the first customers as we have established relationships with them and that many of them have expressed a need for the claims intelligence tool. However, we need to validate the need beyond just community oncology (regional hospitals, large cancer centers, etc.) to ensure that this product can be scalable and sold to other institutions and create larger ACVs.
*   **Characteristics of a successful business model**
    1.  Final payer has to be insurance or biopharma (can be indirectly through providers like RCM)
    2.  The product has to make the user more money that is directly attributable to Solstice
    3.  There needs to be some sort of data flywheel which improves the product and creates a defensible moat
    4.  Average ACV needs to 6-7 figures
    5.  Either some technological or healthcare-related tailwinds — something that makes this uniquely possible now (LLMs, VBC, etc.)

*   Really figure out the direction of the business – Get an A+ customer development

## 1/04/24 Meeting

### Updates:
*   **Product Updates:**
    *   We're building out a [more integrated workflow](more%20integrated%20workflow) that connects with a practice organization's drive (OneDrive or Google), in which they store incoming faxes to automatically create a patient's profile in Solstice as well as in their practice management software (Unlimited Financials or athenahealth).
        1.  This helps us avoid EMR integration while also embedding ourselves more deeply into their workflow
        2.  By retrieving all the information that a practice needs immediately as their referrals come in, we circumvent the need for manual retrieval anywhere during the patient scheduling process (both by new patient coordinators at the beginning when patients are scheduled and also medical assistants when they later find out they are missing information prior or during a patient appointment).

### Long-Term Workflow
**For each patient**
Referrals come in through fax -> Solstice machine reads faxes and extracts patient demographics -> Solstice creates the chart in practice management software -> Solstice automatically pulls patient records -> NP coordinator can view and download patient reports
*(All steps except "Referrals come in through fax" and "NP coordinator can view and download patient reports" are simultaneous with "Solstice machine reads faxes and extracts patient demographics")*

### Sales/GTM/Distribution
1.  **Current Users:**
    *   **OOS:**
        *   Usage remains great
        *   Traci got the new workflow approved and we'll be onboarding them onto it next week.
        *   Still need API access from Unlimited Financials
    *   **Alabama:**
        *   Not using the platform too frequently because they get most of the data from the referring provider. They focus on surgical oncology where data needs are not as large.
        *   Updated Chris (the executive director) on pilot and asked for trial with the medical oncology team as well. We also sent him the demo for automating referrals.
2.  **Pipeline:**
    *   Rescheduled Astera Cancer Care to this Friday
    *   Sierra Hematology Oncology pilot starting today. Since Sierra is a small practice we decided to circumvent the BAA signing process by embedding it in the [Terms of Service on the website](Terms%20of%20Service%20on%20the%20website). We're giving them 20 free chart pull
    *   Beginning trial with Kidney Medical Clinic on 1/9
    *   We are re-engaging in outreach across Oregon/Alabama
        1.  Outreach efforts in December was not good
            *   861 emails to 2 sales calls
        2.  Will retry post holidays with focus on physicians instead of admin
    *   We will also re-engage the oncology clinics within a pipeline since engagement with them in December was not good
3.  **Advisor wishlist**
    *   As promised from our previous discussion - [Here](Here).
    *   Case Study for HCC Coding - [here](here)
4.  **Discussion:**
    *   Response to outreach + movement in our pipeline has been slow
        1.  Is this because of our sales strategy or a problem with the value proposition?

### Cash/Runway

## 12/14/23 Meeting - Virtue

### Updates:
*   **Product Updates:**
    *   Still some lagging issues with Oregon data
    *   More integrated intake process discussed with Oregon
*   **Sales/GTM/Distribution**
    *   **Current Users:**
        *   **OOS:**
            *   Visited them this week – Met Traci, the head of Ops as well as the entire teams at oncology, Rheumatology and Infectious Disease
            *   The oncology team has both new patient coordinators and Medical Assistants who use the platform. Everyone is really happy with the platform for the most part. Said they've gone from spending 5-6 hours/day on records to less than 1.
                *   Discussed few improvements including better way to determine duplicates, better filtering, and indicating providers needed with data
            *   The Infectious Disease team is not seeing much value because >90% of their patients come from nearby hospitals that they have EMR access to. Will transfer their access to Rheumatology who has referrals coming from all over.
        *   Traci gave us many ideas for additional things they are struggling with. Will focus for now but interesting future directions for us to look into.
            *   She thinks long-term they'll cut down staff long-term due to Solstice
        *   **Alabama Oncology:**
            *   Ashley is not using the platform too frequently because she gets most of the data she needs from a referring provider since she focuses on Surgical Oncology where data needs are not as large.
            *   Updated Chris on pilot and asked for trial with the medical oncology team as well.
            *   Realization here and with Oregon is that platform adds value when there is a. Depth of data needed b. Referrals coming from all over
    *   **Prospective Users:**
        *   Sierra Hematology Oncology
            *   Two locations in Sacramento
            *   They express interest in trialing the platform
            *   Scheduling an onboarding session with them for early next week.
        *   **Rocky Mountain Cancer Centers:**
            *   Waiting on hearing back from them regarding the start of the trial period still
            *   Jonathan Hirsch mentioned that it might be because their compliance is asking US Oncology for approval in which case it might not come.
    *   **New Practice Outreach**
        *   Sales call with Astera next Tuesday. Bob (Director of Operations) is interested and said this is a big pain point for them but said the price point of $7000/month was too expensive for them to move forward.
            *   Discussing pricing with him today. Won't propose a trial and will try to get him to sign. Can we go over the skeleton of the pitch together?
            *   Optimize for usage/learning but let's not focus on the exact price point we give them. We need to be in the practice and understand what is going on. Our main priority is determining what exactly makes Solstice special or what could make it special.
            *   Be transparent about what we need out of the relationship between us and Astera. Tell him what we would want out of the relationship (what we want our learnings to be in 12 months) but ask for something in return (resource commitment, bandwidth) for a low price point.
        *   Email outreach has not been getting good responses this past month. Our hypothesis:
            *   We shifted from targeting doctors to clinic managers/operations people. All of our previous pilots were through doctors who then referred to managers. Are now reverting back to this approach.
            *   Holidays/poorer response?
*   How do we get a strong set of advisors that have different skill sets and have the capacity to be engaged?
    *   Find an ideal profile of an advisor that would be able to help us
        *   GTM/Relationships with providers
        *   Product/Technical
        *   Clinical/Content of reports
    *   Give examples, who would this ideal person look like?
    *   Create this for next time we chat.

### Current Events:
*   Thoughts on EPIC/TEFCA?
    *   Simply finding CDAs will be table stakes
*   EHI Export

## 11/29/23 Meeting

### Updates:
*   **Product Updates:**
    *   Built out logic to handle outlier health systems in Oregon so that we can process them. Need a more sustainable solution for this in the future.
    *   Built out upload request feature that allows users to request by uploading intake form
    *   Implementation of new automated fax logic almost complete
*   **Sales/GTM/Distribution**
    *   **Current Users:**
        *   **OOS:**
            *   Continuing to use the platform at a steady rate.
            *   Only need to intervene on one off cases.
            *   Have capacity to onboard another practice the size of OOS
        *   **Alabama Oncology:**
            *   Pilot kickoff call with the CEO went well. Mentioned they are short staffed and are looking for ways to get more out of their staff.
            *   Said EMR Integration costs them $7k for initial build and $3.5k for maintenance, hinted that they'd be open if we handle costs
            *   Not really interested in this data for VBC, saw more potential in helping them ensure they get approved for prior authorization instead
            *   Began official pilot on Monday and had a nurse using the platform make requests on the spot.
            *   Built out a feature to have them upload referral documents instead of type in patient demographics. Found this to be really effective so far.
    *   **Prospective Users:**
        *   **NMCC call:**
            *   Dr. McAneny, the CEO of NMCC, decided not to move forward with Solstice.
            *   She said they're going to continue with their current process of records retrieval and didn't see value in "having another fax in the middle" which shows that there seems to be a misunderstanding in the value.
            *   Our takeaways: Given her feedback, we don't think any price point would have converted them. They only have one staff member handling records and she also has other tasks so they wouldn't have replaced her and she only saw Solstice helping with one off patients, not replacing their entire workflow.
        *   **Rocky Mountain Cancer Centers:**
            *   Waiting on hearing back from them regarding the start of the trial period.
        *   **Maryland Oncology**
            *   Had a call with Nicole, the practice manager to go over VBC/Prior Auth and how they handle these processes.
                *   They participate in MIPS not EOM. Just joined PCM.
                *   Total cost of care is 30% of their reimbursement for MIPS. Things such as redundant labs and imaging affect this. (i.e. if a patient has a lab done but a doctor reorders it because they didn't have prior information).
                *   Prior auth is a pain for them and claims are often rejected because of sufficient clinical data to prove that the patient has had precursor labs/imaging done.
        *   **New Practice Outreach**
            *   Reached back out to Astera Cancer Care, West Cancer Clinics, and Mary Bird Perkins
                *   Astera has already gotten back and is interested, gave him pricing
            *   Doing broad outreach across Oregon (across specialties)
        *   **Creating a case study on RAF scores for Maryland**
            *   Retrospective analysis on data tha MOH pulls vs. data Solstice pulls to identify ICD-10 codes that map out to specific HCC codes. Then we use HCC codes to calculate total RAF scores for patients to determine monthly reimbursements for them.
        *   **Team:**
            *   Have a working session with a promising lead this Sunday but haven't really prioritized this.

*   Consolidate Learnings + track how its influencing thinking. What is the long-term value of this data asset?

### Cash/Runway:
*   Cash: $3,060,116.77
*   Accounts Payable: -$10,068.11
*   Total: $3,050,048.66
*   Monthly Burn: $29,659
*   Run Rate: 103 months

### Discussion:
*   **Value Proposition:**
    *   **Takeaways since last conversation:**
        *   VBC Potential in Cancer seems low/slow – there is potential to help with risk adjustment but would have to be in a different customer demographic like primary care/kidney care
        *   Prior data could be used for purposes of ensuring prior auth approvals + preventing duplicate test but prior authorization is a crowded space + what the exact solution here would be murky
    *   **How to prioritize**
        *   #1 focus is still making sure Oregon + Alabama is happy
        *   #2 is reaching out to more practices – both within our pipeline and beyond
            *   Focus is: 1) specialty care HCOs in Oregon and 2) practices we've previously spoken with
            *   The difficulty is balance between looking to sell current offering vs exploring appetite for HCC Coding tool/prior auth

## 11/14/23 Meeting

### Updates:
*   **Product**
    *   Oregon is entirely automated outside of two main considerations:
        1.  Some of the health systems in Oregon that don't follow the same data format as others: VA, Willamette Valley, Praxis Health, Santiam Hospital. Almost done writing logic to automate these away by writing custom logic to handle their data types but need a more scalable solution long term
        2.  Automating faxes. Previously we were using Record Locator Service which is inaccurate but now we need to transition to scanning through progress notes to find referral locations and writing code to do this in an automated fashion.
*   **Sales/GTM/Distribution**
    *   **Current customers:**
        *   Launched across Oregon Oncology with 20 of their admin staff using the platform.
        *   Making on average 75 requests per week for new and established patients ($5.33/patient)
    *   **NMCC call:**
        *   Discussed next steps & pricing: We had separate calls between the CEO and the practice manager (who used the platform) because the practice manager joined late.
        *   As a result, they mentioned that they would discuss it between themselves.
        *   Mentioned they might want to use it only for the systems that their admin staff can't pull herself (out-of-state, certain health systems, etc) Raise the question of whether time-savings for employees is even a value prop
        *   Mentioned $10-$15 pricing with different structures
    *   **Alabama Oncology:**
        *   Having a call with them tomorrow to discuss implementing across their Grandview clinic & possible OncoEMR integration discussion
        *   We will prepare some KPIs to validate across the pilot
        *   They would like to discuss MIPS too
        *   The concern is that they want an unpaid pilot.
        *   The goal is to demonstrate good use and reliance/dependence and learn as much as we can over the pricing initially. The goal is just to get in there and learn.
    *   **Rocky Mountain Cancer Centers** (10-14 locations)
        *   Asked for the BAA & services agreement to initiate the trial and they forwarded it to their compliance teams
    *   **Community Memorial Health System:**
        *   2 hospitals and 20 outpatient clinics in California
        *   Spoke to their Director of Population Health, who mentioned that the platform would be interesting for them. They mentioned it would be something that they would be interested in piloting.
        *   Saving their staff time getting complete and interpretable records from the community is something that would be helpful, but she sees a stronger value prop in how these records could help generate an ROI through HCCs. (They are a part of an ACO)
*   **Team:**
    *   We have a few more leads for the new technical hire and are planning a working session with one of them over the next week. We are not in a rush to hire and would prefer to be closer to PMF before bringing someone on.
    *   **How are we defining PMF today? This definitely evolves over time but be explicit (qualitative and quantitative metrics to allow us to be confident that we have PMF) to make sure this is the north star guiding us. Include this in the agenda.**

### Cash/Runway:
*   Vesto: $2,604,435.38 (Treasury)
*   Meow: $338,977.02 (High-yield checking)
*   Chase: $121,466,21
*   Total: $3,064,878.61

### Discussion:
*   **Framing the value proposition for customers:**
    *   **Cost-savings vs. revenue generation**
        *   We think a stronger value proposition is how we utilize the data to enhance a key aspect of their workflow, not solely retrieving the data and handing it to them (even in a structured way) because it's hard for practices to see value in just time-savings
    *   Saving retrieval or chart review time is not a strong enough value proposition on its own. It is important to combine it with revenue generation.
*   **Two main ways to generate additional revenue:**
    *   Using patient charts we have retrieved to help determine HCC coding so that providers can calculate accurate risk scores for their patients. More prior history = more relevant comorbidities for the patient = more HCCs=higher RAF scores = higher reimbursements for patient
    *   Not sure how many of the cancer practices we work with take on risk to this degree, need to speak with them about this or identify other areas where this is a greater fit
    *   Drug costs: how do ensure that all the infusions get done in the community and not at hospitals. How do we quantify that?
    *   Revenue cycles: how do we limit denials and get more prior auth?
    *   Even in FFS, what is driving revenue? Likely administration of drugs
*   Creating succinct summaries of patient prior medical histories so providers spend less time reviewing charts and have more time for visits (we think this is less strong)

## 11/1/23 Meeting

### Updates:
*   **Onboarding Oregon**
    *   SOC 2 compliance
*   **Upcoming NMCC call**
    *   Discuss pricing options
        *   Subscription fee (fixed) based on patient volumes - annual contract ($10 per new patient)
        *   Per patient fee/variable pricing ($15 per new patient)
        *   Location-specific fees if they want to initially scale across individual locations at a time
        *   Quantifying the value of IHS for them and showing them a graph of the information we were able to retrieve during the trial
    *   Discuss EHR integration options (potentially have them pay a fixed fee)
        *   Emre to connect us with Flatiron people so we can discuss how difficult integration
*   **Call with Rocky Mountain Cancer Centers**
    *   120-130 new patients per month across one location (~10 locations across Colorado)
    *   We sent them an information deck and outlined next steps, and we are waiting for them to get back to us so we can initiate the trial.

### Discussion about how to handle conversation with NMCC:
*   **Pricing:**
    *   $10/new patient for monthly subscription
    *   $15/new patient for one off requests
*   **Integration:**
    *   Set up or no set up fee
    *   Do you know anyone with experience handling integrations?
