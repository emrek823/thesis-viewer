### SMB’s Data Access Strategy

- “Start at the top and go up” is the mantra for introductions
- University RWD companies with exclusive data access - currently in discussions with one, expecting decision tonight or tomorrow
- Good introduction from trusted person who’s worked with target before is crucial
- Come in super humble - “we only want to do 10% of the work” resonates well despite sounding like bad business proposition

### Data Type Priorities and Current Focus

- Best strides in oncology, next focus on immunology (where Eric can add value)
- Prioritized data types:
	- Whole genome sequencing - somatic and germline (often locked down but valuable partners have it)
	- EHRs - widely available, can be ingested in any format
	- CT scans
	- Pathology - space is chaotic currently, letting it percolate

### Health System Positioning and Needs

- Don’t win on “we need something today” acute problem solving at this stage
- Make real inroads with partners who want:
	- Piece of foundation model frontier science action
	- Alternative to maxed out data licensing revenue
- University partners with exclusive data rights interested in selling foundation models fine-tuned on their data
- Example partner profile: university-cobranded company that can’t easily acquire more data, needs to upsell AI solutions

### Strategic Partnerships and Market Timing

- UK Biobank secured with tier 3 access in record time (3 weeks)
- NHS follow-up meeting scheduled - policy contact stated “if I’m not involved in multimodal foundation models for digital twins now, I won’t be relevant in 4 years”
- Major AMC partnership developing cardiac toxicity prediction as proof of concept
- NIH approach planned when time is right with warm introductions
- Moment in time to get access to the best data and establish foundation model leadership

### Fundraising Discussion and Next Steps

- Originally planned fundraising post-JPM, now considering September timing
- Considering $10M raise vs smaller bridge round
- Virtue VC offered to lead with $1.5-2M+ available immediately
- Key concerns: competitive pressure, pharma partners asking about funding levels
- Strategy to build commercial traction before larger institutional round at JPM

### Next Steps

- Kevin and team: Internal decision on fundraising amount and timing (tonight/tomorrow)
- Thursday 10 AM meeting scheduled: Emre to visit SMB team in person
- Emre: Send over Kaiser and Cedars contact details and requirements
- Both parties: Continue discussions on partnership structure and data rights
