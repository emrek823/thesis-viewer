# Health Tech Investment Act (S.1399): Research Overview & Virtue Implications

*Research date: 2026-01-11*
*Status: In Committee (Senate Finance)*

## Bill Summary

**Status:** Introduced April 9, 2025 by Senators Mike Rounds (R-SD) and Martin Heinrich (D-NM). Currently in Senate Committee on Finance. Companion bill H.R.6197 introduced in House.

**Core Purpose:** Creates the first statutory Medicare reimbursement pathway for **Algorithm-Based Healthcare Services (ABHS)**—defined as services delivered through FDA-cleared/approved devices using AI/ML to yield clinical outputs for physician use.

---

## Key Provisions

| Provision | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **New Payment Classification** | Creates "New Technology Ambulatory Payment Classification" under OPPS specifically for AI services |
| **Payment Basis** | Rates set from manufacturer-submitted cost data (subscription fees, staffing, operations) |
| **Stability Period** | Minimum **5 years** of separate reimbursement before transition to standard classifications |
| **SaaS Codification** | Retroactively codifies CMS 2022 rule on software-as-a-service payments back to January 2023 |
| **Concurrent Billing** | Permits reimbursement when AI services performed alongside other procedures |
| **HHS Requirements** | Secretary must revise application procedures and evaluation criteria for AI technologies |

**Eligibility Criteria:**
1. Delivered via FDA-cleared/approved medical device
2. Uses AI/ML to generate clinical outputs or conclusions
3. Designed for healthcare practitioner use and review

**Exclusion:** Clinical decision support software meeting FDA's criteria for non-regulated status (where practitioners can independently review without "relying primarily" on AI output) does NOT qualify.

---

## Current Market Context

- **600+ FDA-authorized AI devices** as of April 2025 (1,250+ by July 2025)
- **No consistent Medicare payment system** exists—AI tools often absorbed into bundled payments or lack billing codes entirely
- **Digital health VC funding:** $6.4B in H1 2025; AI-enabled startups captured 62% ($3.95B)
- AI-backed companies raise **$34.4M average per round** (83% premium over non-AI)

## Direct Implications for Virtue's Theses

### 1. **Medicare Reimbursement Unlocks AI Cardiac Imaging** — STRONGLY VALIDATED

Our thesis already captures this dynamic: "CMS/Medicare reimburses $950-$1,017 for AI cardiac CT interpretation (5x the scan itself)."

**S.1399 impact:**
- **Codifies** the ad-hoc MAC approval pathway into statute
- **Extends protection** from 5 MACs approving to guaranteed 5-year reimbursement period
- **De-risks** Cleerly, HeartFlow, Caristo business models—predictable revenue replaces MAC-by-MAC uncertainty
- **Accelerates** health system adoption—CFOs can model multi-year ROI with confidence

**Implication:** If enacted, thesis timeline accelerates. The reimbursement mechanism becomes bulletproof regardless of future CMS leadership changes. Companies like Cleerly become safer bets.

---

### 2. **Healthcare AI Stack Wins Through Infrastructure** — MIXED IMPACT

**Positive:**
- Multi-EHR platforms (Ambience, Commure) benefit from reimbursement clarity for AI-enabled services
- Coding/billing integration becomes even more valuable—these platforms help health systems capture new ABHS revenue

**Neutral/Negative:**
- Epic bundling threat remains—S.1399 doesn't change Epic's ability to bundle AI scribing at low cost
- The bill focuses on **diagnostic AI devices**, not clinical documentation AI (scribing/CDI)—these may not qualify as "ABHS" under the current definition since they're workflow tools, not FDA-cleared diagnostic devices

**Key Question:** Does ambient documentation qualify as an "algorithm-based healthcare service"? Likely **no**—these are practice management tools, not FDA-regulated medical devices generating diagnostic conclusions.

---

### 3. **Clinical Documentation AI Expands Beyond Scribes** — INDIRECT BENEFIT

CDI/coding platforms likely don't qualify directly under S.1399 (not FDA-regulated devices). However:
- Creates **halo effect** for healthcare AI broadly—investors and health systems become more comfortable with AI adoption
- Clearer reimbursement for AI imaging/diagnostics could **free up budget** for CDI/coding tools
- Validates the "AI in healthcare revenue cycle" category that CDI plays in

---

### 4. **Consumer AI Health Platforms** — WATCH CLOSELY

**Potential beneficiary:** If physician-in-the-loop AI services qualify as ABHS, platforms connecting consumers to AI-augmented physician consultations could access Medicare reimbursement.

**Current limitation:** Most consumer platforms lack FDA-cleared device components—they use AI for triage/engagement, not FDA-approved diagnostics.

---

## Theses Impact Matrix

| Thesis | Impact Level | Mechanism |
|--------|--------------|-----------|
| AI Cardiac Imaging | **HIGH** | Direct: Codifies existing reimbursement, adds 5-year stability |
| JEPA World Models for Clinical Decisions | **MEDIUM** | If JEPA-based diagnostic tools get FDA clearance, clear payment pathway |
| RWD Infrastructure | **MEDIUM** | AI tools analyzing RWD for clinical decisions could qualify |
| Biotech Operations Intelligence | **LOW** | Trial ops AI unlikely to be patient-facing FDA devices |
| Pharmacovigilance Platforms | **LOW** | Backend safety monitoring, not clinical decision support |
| CDI/Coding Platforms | **INDIRECT** | Budget freed up, validation of category, but not direct beneficiaries |

## Strategic Investment Implications

### What Becomes More Investable

1. **AI diagnostic imaging** (radiology, cardiology, pathology)
   - FDA-cleared + Medicare pathway = complete commercialization stack
   - 5-year reimbursement stability reduces revenue risk for growth-stage companies

2. **AI-enabled point-of-care diagnostics**
   - Devices generating clinical conclusions for physician use
   - Example: AI-powered ultrasound, retinal imaging, dermatology screening

3. **Platform plays aggregating multiple FDA-cleared AI tools**
   - Health systems will want single billing relationship for ABHS
   - Opportunity for "ABHS aggregators" that integrate multiple AI devices

### What Remains Unchanged

1. **Ambient documentation/scribing** — Not FDA devices, not ABHS
2. **CDI/coding AI** — Workflow tools, not diagnostic devices
3. **Patient engagement/triage AI** — Consumer-facing, not FDA-cleared
4. **Prior authorization AI** — Payer tools, not provider-facing diagnostics

### New Opportunity Spaces

**"ABHS-first" startup strategy:**
- Build with FDA clearance AND Medicare pathway in mind from day one
- 5-year reimbursement stability provides rare predictability for healthcare startups
- Could justify higher valuations for companies with FDA + ABHS positioning

**Reimbursement navigation services:**
- Complexity of ABHS applications + manufacturer cost data submission creates consulting opportunity
- Similar to 510(k) consulting but for payment pathway

## Passage Probability & Timeline

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Bipartisan sponsorship** | Positive: Rounds (R) + Heinrich (D) |
| **Industry support** | Strong: AdvaMed, FDA, major medtech companies |
| **CBO scoring** | Unknown: Could show short-term Medicare cost increase |
| **Political environment** | Mixed: AI broadly popular, but healthcare spending scrutiny |
| **Companion bill** | Positive: H.R.6197 shows House interest |

**Estimate:** 40-50% chance of passage in some form within 24 months. May get incorporated into larger healthcare or appropriations bill rather than standalone.

**Watch for:**
- Committee hearings and markups
- CBO score release
- Integration into reconciliation or must-pass legislation
- Industry lobbying momentum

## Recommendations for Virtue

1. **Strengthen AI cardiac imaging thesis** — If S.1399 passes, this becomes highest-conviction healthcare AI bet. Current positioning is correct.

2. **Screen for FDA-cleared AI companies** — Filter deal flow for companies with (a) FDA 510(k) or De Novo clearance, (b) diagnostic output for physician use, (c) reimbursement strategy in pitch. These benefit most from S.1399.

3. **Monitor CDI/scribing companies for FDA pivots** — If any ambient players seek FDA clearance for clinical decision support capabilities, they could access ABHS pathway.

4. **Due diligence question to add:** "Is your product likely to qualify as an Algorithm-Based Healthcare Service under S.1399 criteria?"

5. **Track bill status** via [Congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/senate-bill/1399) and [GovTrack](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/s1399). Material changes in status are investment signals.
