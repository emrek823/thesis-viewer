Underwriting Notes/Introduction Questions:

Product:

WriteWise in concert with Ventegra Wholesale and the Intercept Rx program is developing an Rx only Level Funded Product to cover all drugs except inpatient J codes (which will fall under the medical plan).  They want to offer level funded coverage that returns the surplus to the group or offers protection on cost escalation through ESL.  Ventegra is the only non profit PBM in the country which requires every drug manufacturer in the US, by federal mandate, to provide their wholesale price from production to them.  WriteWise has established an exclusive partnership with Ventegra for the Guaranteed cost product and through the Intercept program can integrate into any PBM to divert into wholesale pricing or can take over the entire PBM operation on a whitelabled basis.

Noted that generally C&F assigns Medical/Pharmacy proportions at 70/30.  If specialty drug claims volume is greater than 2% of total claims and/or greater than 50% of the cost of all drugs, then the loss ratio for the medical plan will be > 100%.  The underwriting platform WriteWise has created has the first pharmacy only manual (validated by Windsor) in the industry and incorporates wholesale pricing and rebates with known spreads.

Products currently under consideration at WriteWise:

Level Funded pharmacy product (Rx carveout) for PBM performance guarantees – CURRENT OPPORTUNITY

Generics only drug option either standalone or wrapped with MEC/MVC plans (Gig or seasonal workers)

Fully “baked” level funded product (traditional distribution as well as PEO) with pharmacy carve out

MEC/MVC with pharmacy carve out

They are proposing an Aggregate only, Rx only product with a 115% aggregate corridor up to 125% for any traditional ESL coverage.

What is Target Market & Distribution?

The product will focus on groups with 100 to a 1000 EEs that are currently self insured on an ASO pharmacy contract to minimize the single drug specialty risk, but they are planning to write all types of entities (including PEOs, tribes and government entities).

On our call in December, Hari noted that a lot of Verikai cost scores are driven by variance in compliance and adherence to Rx, with are reflected in higher scores for medical cost but negative trend in regards to the Rx cost for generic and brand but the reverse for specialty (where adherence rates are significantly higher).   By repricing the specialty to wholesale and being able to correctly price compliance with brand and generic, WriteWise can carve out those groups with the highest net margin on pharmacy but who are being overpriced with the combined rate due the inability of the competitive carrier to actuarially assign contribution of medical vs pharmacy correctly to total claiming.

In the >100 EE market, WriteWise will be leveraging PBM partners and their existing TPA/Broker relationships to carve out pharmacy offerings directly from currently self-insured employers.   The market has experience with this but has not had, to date, an insured product offering that can back stop guaranteed cost risk in market or a manual understanding of either the wholesale or retail cost by AGI.   They want to be the default provider of that product where the risk is low but there is a market need to help sell the underlying PBM services themselves.    By eventually being able to wrap a medical offering around it, they feel they can move the risk over wholesale while mitigating the risk of counterselling that currently exists in market.

They will be leveraging MGAs and MGUs that write meaningful amounts of self insured business currently and Captives that are looking to carve out specialty risk for distribution.

In the <100 EE market, they expect to distribute the product in the sub-50market exclusively through HRIS platform providers as a white-labeled SMB insurance offering. By partnering with existing platforms that offer a suite of SMB HR, Payroll and Benefit solutions, they anticipate SMBs that select the product will either: (1) Bring their Own Broker ("BOB"); (2) Utilize the platform’s existing in-house brokerage capabilities; or (3) be assigned to one of our exclusive broker partners for plan servicing. Structuring this level of flexibility allows for existing brokers to retain customers; platform partners to execute on their in-house brokerage models; and/or continuing to allow platform providers to keep licensed broker activities outside of their model while still providing access to a bespoke, white-labeled solution.  This is currently out of scope but may be added at a later date.

There is no current internal sales team, but they plan to scale one up.  The outreach will be to TPAs, Captives, PBMs directly, and MGUs.

Matthew Levinson will hold the producer licenses - WriteWise will be the entity that will hold those licenses for C&F to appoint to bind coverage.   The licenses are active in every state except Washington.

McCain Ashurst will run Rx cost containment through Intercept Rx, a white labeled Rx program that leverages the only non profit pharmacy wholesaler in the US.

Intro email also to Todd Cohn at Fidelio Advisors, which is a PEO advisory firm and Don Trudeau, who runs HBA (Health Benefit Alliance), the largest MEC/MVC plan in the country with 30,000 covered lives where the pharmacy only platform will allow combined claims to be repriced.

Marketing/Underwriting Strategy & Value Proposition:

WriteWise will deploy a multi-faceted approach to marketing and underwriting with extensive staff experience and market knowledge.  They will leverage underwriting and risk management tools, innovative production management techniques, and dedicated national production relationships.

Identify Underwriting Manual System and process notes:

The manual was developed using data provided by claims clearinghouses (Change, IBM, Health Verity, Komodo) and from Verikai.  This data was then aggregated within age and gender buckets and scored to geography to account for network of the fill and industry.   WriteWise then reprices the group based on the wholesale pricing data that they get from their PBM partners and use that as a baseline against the manual expectation net of the Verikai variance.  The manual is currently being validated by Windsor who has experience from being the actuarial firm behind the pricing of BeneCard, the largest pharmacy only aggregator in the country.

In the north of a 100 EE market the aggregated claims are provided as well, so that serves as an understanding of competitive pricing and they don't cover inpatient infusions currently.

In the sub-100 EE market, they would eventually like to sell the product with medical included and exclude all groups with pre-existing cancer, rare disease or autoimmune risk.  This is not part of the current opportunity and would primarily focus on the community rated market where they have experienced meaningful success previously.

We got a demo of their proprietary UW system which takes in the census, election, status, the historical rate, and the renewal.  Notes from the 4/18/23 demo:

The manual is HealthMaps but with a base rate adjustment

The base rate comes from data from Anthem, UHC, Cigna, and Aetna FI data

Manual Plus = variance to manual base rate adjusted

Claims Plus is adherence and compliance

Base rate multiplied by claims plus and manual plus creates the aggregate attachment point

Participation rate and match rate must be at least 50% or they automatically DTQ

The system is programmed to certain diagnosis or concentrations of diagnosis

They can understand the repricing of Rx.

Use preset plans and match risk for that.

Underwritten by WriteWise Health.

They currently have one underwriter on staff for $25M existing level-funded premium at Radion with loss ratios on net premium running at 68% on 15 months of experience.

Individual health questionnaires will not be required.

Underwriting Process:

1. Submission

2. Run proprietary pharmacy only manual on individuals without prescription history.

3.  Reprice to wholesale those individuals with prescription history.

4. Verikai scoring – If the Claims Plus score is greater than 1.15, then Rx can’t be carved out.  If the Claims Plus score is less than 1.15, then combine 2 and 3, price in to a 115% aggregate.

5. “HV overlay” provided to eliminate groups with pre-existing continuous conditions that are <1% prevalence if medical coverage necessary

6.   Create level funded premium with 60% employer guaranteed cost contribution and the remainder as premium.

7. Release quote and bind coverage within 24 hours.
