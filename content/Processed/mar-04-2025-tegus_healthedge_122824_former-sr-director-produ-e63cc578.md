# HealthEdge - Former Sr. Director Product Management at SS&C Technologies

Interview conducted on March 04, 2025

**Topics**
AI, Legacy Systems, Infrastructure, RPA Tools, Legacy Platforms, Machine Learning, Hospital Systems, User Experience

**Summary**
The conversation between the Tegus Client and the expert focused on the comparison between HealthEdge and legacy platforms in the financial data industry, highlighting the challenges faced by SS&C and the potential market leadership of HealthEdge. The discussion emphasized the trade-offs in functionality, ease of training, and efficiency in setting up benefit structures, as well as the potential role of AI in modernizing legacy platforms. The conversation also touched on the potential winners and losers in the healthcare industry, with HealthEdge seen as a potential big winner and TriZetto facing challenges due to lack of investment.

**Expert Details**
Former Sr. Director Product Management at SS&C Technologies, a competitor of HealthEdge.
Former Director of Product Management (Fintech) at Paysign, leaving October 2024.
Former Sr. Director Product Management at SS&C Technologies Holdings, Inc, leaving July 2024.
Former Director of Marketplace Products at Truveris, leaving in November 2022.
Prior to Truveris, the expert was a Director of Product and Strategy at OptumRX, leaving in April of 2021. The expert was responsible for determining business, portfolio, and product strategy, setting direction, forming important partnerships, bringing in the voice of the customer into the organization, and building a high-performing organization.
Former Director of Client Solutions at Progyny, Inc. (PGNY), leaving June 2018. The expert focused on performing a number of functional roles given they joined the company when it was in its start-up infancy. The advisor standardized the Progyny Fertility Benefit structure, which could then be tied out to analytics to provide external support and validation which drove value (savings and positive pregnancy and birth outcome results). The advisor presented the Progyny benefit structure, client pre-sales analytics, and value, and managed the client benefit implementation process and team internally and externally. The advisor also worked with the network team to ensure adequate access to treatment and favorable treatment and treatment cost terms. The advisor also has prior fertility benefit experience from a large US Medical HealthCare insurance carrier and has seen the perspective of this type of benefit both from a 3rd party vendor standpoint and a large healthcare insurance carrier perspective.

**Q: Do you have experience using HealthEdge? Were you involved in the decision to select is as the vendor for your group?**
**A:** I have experience using them but I am not a customer I can speak to the overall industry, I have knowledge on them but I am a competitor of this solution. I know everything about this platform from the backend to the front end! I've seen all angles

**Q: Who else have you used or who else did you compare HealthEdge to when selecting it?**
**A:** conduent, cotnizat, oracle, and my own company DST, there are a whole bunch in the market.

**Q: Can you speak in detail about pros and cons of HealthEdge vs. competing vendors (TriZetto) or homegrowgn systems?**
**A:** Yes I can speak to this in detail from different perspectives, pricing models, utilization, operations etc

**Q: What is your title and role within your organization?**
**A:** Senior Director of Product Management at SS&C Health Technologies Holding

**Q: How long have you been in the industry? Describe your organization briefly - how big is it in terms of members or revenue?**
**A:** i've been in the industry for about 18 years members for SS&C 200 million.

**Client**
Hey there. Thank you for taking the time to speak with us. Purpose of this call is to understand CAPS software and broader payer software in general with a focus on HealthEdge. You were at SS&C for a while. Maybe we could just start with what your experience at SS&C was and your high-level assessment of what that landscape of CAPS software providers looks like today.

**Expert**
First of all, my experience at SS&C, I oversaw their CAPS-related platforms. They have four, but the main flagship is AMISYS, and they were going through a process of sunsetting the three older platforms, trying to think of ways to innovate with the AMISYS platform, though it's an old monolithic platform.

Over the course of whatever, that last eight years or whatever between DST being the sole owner of AMISYS and then eventually SS&C, trying to retain clients, though many had been leaving because there was a lack of investment in the AMISYS platform, and many left to go to HealthEdge, as well as then when you lose clients, you don't need as many staff.

Some of the staff that were let go on various reorgs over the past eight years, again, whether during the time of DST or when DST was purchased by SS&C, many of these folks that worked on some of these claim platforms actually ended up at HealthEdge. I would say by and large, HealthEdge is no doubt probably viewed as the industry leader, not maybe in all facets. We can obviously in the next hour go into those particular details, but by and large, I would say they're one of the largest market owners, if you will, of the CAPS space, particularly in the medical claims area, if not possibly as well, and maybe in the pharmacy side as well.

I'll just say this too, I spent probably the last 60 months at SS&C delving into the overall scan of the market here from a standpoint of how could SS&C, if we aren't going to have the Tesla version, market-leading solution, what type of personas could we target, what are their needs, wants, desires, price points, all that stuff, because not everybody can afford much less needs a HealthEdge at the end of the day.

There's many opportunities for other players outside of HealthEdge, though, no doubt, HealthEdge owns a significant portion of the market, and I'll just pause there just to see if you have any immediate questions, thoughts or things you'd like me to expand on.

**Client**
There's a lot there. Just what's so much better about HealthEdge? Maybe let's just start with, before we get to that, what does the actual landscape look like in terms of what parts of the market are homegrown versus TriZetto versus HealthEdge versus SS&C and other? How does that pie shape? How does that pie look?

**Expert**
Yeah. I think homegrown's probably got to be maybe 20%, 30% of the market are homegrown platforms, a

lot of what I viewed because I was part of a lot of RFPs that we were entering into SS&C. That's where you definitely got to see like, "Hey, are we going up against one of the well-known competitors and they just have an older version of their platform or is it homegrown?"

In a lot of the regional, state-based, if not even, I would say hospital system-based plans, there's where you'd more often than not find homegrown, monolithic old platforms. Your big three health plans, big three PBMs, and just the big guys, they typically are already working with a Cognizant, or in this case, TriZetto, or a HealthEdge, or Oracle, or Javelina, or somebody.

**Client**
Got it. That other 70%-80%?

**Expert**
Yeah. I'd say 70%-80% seem to be with one of the typical CAPS vendors in the market. Just note too, some of this with the big guys, the big players or the big health plans, a lot of them, their growth is strictly through M&A. They buy a lot of companies and they bought a lot of mid-market health plans, PBMs, over the past 20+ years. These platforms have naturally come with those businesses. That's also part and partial to why they naturally seem to be aligned with some of these bigger CAPS players.

**Client**
Do they typically force migrate the acquisition onto their own platform, or do they keep it running?

**Expert**
Given my two tenures at UnitedHealthcare at large, the ultimate goal is always to try to consolidate and get them on a certain platform instead of having multiple platforms, developers, all the other resources you need. I'll say as much as there's talk always about doing that, it just never seems to translate or occur because they'll always find some reason why it's just not feasible.

I think in my 16 years or so, two different tours of duty at United, out of all the platforms, I might have seen two that were at least partially sunset, meaning they moved a certain book of business off. Maybe they took the Medicare business off of Facets and then put it on something else that they had but never counted.

**Client**
If you have to estimate, how much of that remaining 70%-80% is TriZetto versus HealthEdge versus everyone else?

**Expert**
This is just me talking. I'm thinking, maybe 30%-35% could still be TriZetto. I will say this, and it may be higher, especially when you get to the Blues plans. The Blues plans, no doubt, some of them were just in love with TriZetto. That was their standard bearer in terms of CAPS platforms over the years. HealthEdge has moved in too. I know this just based on some losses that we had at SS&C where they might have had our platform plus TriZetto, running two different businesses to those. It was like, nope, Blues at North Carolina just went straight to HealthEdge for everything, for all lines of business.

**Client**
If TriZetto is 30%-35%, safe to assume HealthEdge is probably half that size?

**Expert**
Yeah. Possibly even challenging them now. Like I said, HealthEdge, I've been talking to a lot of the independent research and advisory groups that focus on the CAPS space. They had indicated at least anecdotally that HealthEdge was even in some cases eating TriZetto's lunch and taking out some TriZetto clients, in fact. I don't know if it would be even half of that. It might be more like 20%, maybe a little bit higher. Whatever remains in that 70% would be any of the other players, like Oracle and some of the other small-time players.

**Client**
You said old monolithic systems. How much of the industry is next gen, whether that means cloud-based or otherwise modern? Maybe you could talk about how much of that is within the TriZetto and the HealthEdge systems specifically. My sense is Facets has a cloud-based platform, but I suspect most of the customers haven't migrated out. I don't want to put words in your mouth. What is that split?

**Expert**
Yeah. We'll have to dissect a little bit about modern because there's some tricks to that phrasing. I'm going to guess that maybe somewhere between 35%-50% are in some sort of more modern version of a CAPS platform. Here's a misnomer. Just because they'll say it's cloud-based doesn't mean it's a leading SaaS-based platform. All they could have done is just taking it from being locally hosted and put it up in the cloud. That's what we did at SS&C.

It didn't change the fact that it was still on COBOL coding. It wasn't using the. I know that, no doubt, in talking, again, to a lot of the research and advisory groups focused on this area, they said, "Yeah. Even TriZetto, you have clients that, for various different reasons, they can't even migrate to the cloud version because their infrastructure can't support it. They got to invest in their infrastructure."

I ran across a lot of either existing SS&C clients or potential clients we were trying to court where they're like, "We'd love to have the latest, greatest Tesla version of a CAPS platform, but our infrastructure doesn't support it much less. We've got to create all these APIs or off-the-shelf APIs and all this other different work to make every other little system that we have that was homegrown or otherwise work with whatever new platform that we want to bring in."

That was always a looming concern. Even with some of the existing clients that we talked to that had some of the competing products like a Facets, they would say "Yeah, we've got the cloud-based version, but we're three versions behind in terms of updating to the latest greatest Facets." They would give all sorts of reasons why that was just not feasible for a number of reasons, even though they wanted a more modernized platform. That's why I put that number at like 35%-50% because there's just all of these roadblocks that you hear from a lot of these health plans or hospital systems as to why they haven't completely made the jump to modernize.

**Client**
What does that look like within the TriZetto customer base? How much would you estimate is legacy stuff versus modern platform of just TriZetto? I'm not going to hold you to these numbers.

**Expert**
That's fair. I heard loosey-goosey numbers that maybe 50%-60% may be more on the modern end or at least started to lean that way with what TriZetto can bring to the table now. Still, there's probably a 40% or 50% that are still just lagging behind in yesteryear.

**Client**
What share of the industry would you say needs to solve the problem of having a legacy solution? What amount of that do you think is up for grabs? My sense of it is, these things, for all the reasons you just said, even when you get a new owner, it's hard to force migrate. How many jump balls are there going to be for these vendors to actually acquire customers from a competitor or from a homegrown solution? What's the pace at which that's happening?

**Expert**
My range is based on my scan of the space, and would suggest that maybe in that 30%-35% jump ball range or opportunity range. It's any number of the things that I just called out like these roadblocks that you have to somehow satiate in order to change an interested payer to a buying payer.

A lot of this also comes down to just finances. I had certain plans are like, whether we agree we need a HealthEdge or not, but we just need to modernize, that was something we do agree on, our infrastructure

would first need to be upgraded to take on anything that's new. We don't have the budget to do that. Our plan is barely getting by as it is today. We take a few more hits, we're in the red. We got problems. They want to modernize, they understand the efficiencies that could come with that, but the initial investment, there's just no budget to follow through on that potential strategy.

**Client**
You're saying 1/3 of the industry is up for grabs?

**Expert**
Yeah, based on my read to the market and the research I conducted.

**Client**
Is that, would you say, already haircut for these budgetary and other constraints, or 30%-35%, is that a true number that's going to come to market and upgrade at some point in the next half decade, or do we need to haircut that number for the phenomenon that you just described?

**Expert**
No, it's taking into account all those factors I just mentioned because I was trying to understand, if we could solve for some of those, put all those in one bucket, could we get 5%, 10% of that market? We solve for some of these roadblocks. That's why I estimated based on all those factors and many more that it's probably 30%-35% because some of them, they're just stuck in a corner. Eventually, the lights are going to go out.

We were facing that too at SS&C. If you don't modernize, this business will cease to exist. Your HealthEdges and others eventually will probably figure it out and not be selling the Cadillac, Tesla version, but giving you the Model three on a budget and priced appropriately, and be able to gobble up the bottom end of the market here is really what I'm describing.

**Client**
Is there a way to segment the market on the payer side in a way that describes either this dynamic of who's legacy versus modern or, for example, is TriZetto very strong in commercial business and HealthEdge very strong in Medicare and Medicaid, and is there a way to overlay where that 30%-35% that's going to be up for grabs?

**Expert**
Absolutely. Cognizant has traditionally, from all my reads and even just from first-hand experience, in terms of lines of business, heavily focused on Medicare, Medicaid, whether they intentionally did it or not, that, more often than not, when you're talking about the Blues plans, the lines of businesses that are on the TriZetto platform have traditionally been Medicare, Medicaid, so government-oriented business. Less so in terms of commercial.

Now, I've heard HealthEdge does a rock star job of setting up benefits and eligibility and all this other great stuff for commercial. Does a decent job with Medicare, Medicaid, back end for HealthEdge in terms of churning through and just crushing high volumes of claims. It's the performative aspect that sometimes falls down for HealthEdge, whereas TriZetto, because this is a long in the tooth platform, it's just an oldie but goodie on the back end in terms of the performance standpoint and just crushing high volumes of claims. It can do it.

That's the same thing we had going for us at SS&C. As much as you want to make it cloud-based and add RPA tools and try to start introducing AI, those were just some of the known pros and cons of some of those platforms. That was just direct feedback from past and existing clients of any of the platforms I just mentioned.

**Client**
Interesting. TriZetto is just maybe you're describing as maybe a little bit more limited in functionality, but

just really robust at high volume?

**Expert**
That's correct. The other things I'll mention here too, and it doesn't sound significant, but you're seeing it with some newer generations coming into the workforce too is another thing worth expressing is that as long as human beings need to interact with these platforms to make them do what they are intended to do, my understanding is HealthEdge is definitely easier to train the younger generation that are used to apps and stuff and just clicking in, going, this just works.

I don't need to understand how it does, but I know I need to get this to do that. How it does it, I don't care. Just got to do it. Touching and just getting it to do things, it's more intuitive and it just does it because the UI UX is definitely more modern. TriZetto, I think, has done some window dressing where the colors and some of the placement of different things that you may have to enter or interact with have changed a little bit. Is it as sleek as HealthEdge? I've been told no, but come to find out too, even when we did some window dressing on ours for SS&C as a test, people liked it.

At the end of the day, when you kept asking them, "What is the big issue? What are you really trying to solve for?" It's like, "We have complex benefits. We need an easier way to set them up." HealthEdge makes it painful, and sometimes, they can't accommodate setting up some of these more complex benefit structures. SS&C and TriZetto, you guys both have an older platform that it's rooted in being able to set up complex benefit structures. The only problem is, it's a pain to set it up.

The younger generation doesn't want to be trained on it because they're like, "This is a bunch of green screen nonsense. I got to be in so many different screens, just a set of benefits." HealthEdge takes that off the table, but it's not as robust in terms of being able to accommodate complex benefit structures. You can train the younger generation easier as others are retiring, if you will, of the workforce that has worked with the TriZettos and AMISYS for years.

People don't want to be trained on those if you're the younger generation, whereas with HealthEdge, it's more accommodating for the younger generation. It's this weird trade off. It's not as robust as HealthEdge, but you can train the younger generation. You can't as well with the other two platforms.

**Client**
Can you explain in more basic terms what does it mean mean better and worse at accommodating complex benefit structures? What would be an example of something that TriZetto could just do better than HealthEdge with respect to that?

**Expert**
For example, you could have an employer that has union, non-union groups, and then within each of those groups, you've got the C-suite level on both sides, and then you've got the office level. You've got the field, the manufacturing side, and you want to break up those groups and provide different forms of commercial, I'm making some of this up a little bit here, but for example, different commercial Medicare, Medicaid plans with different copays or copays that kick in at a certain point, and you've got to set all that up.

Some of the stuff, when you go to set it up, even SS&C, you've got to take different numbers for plans and remember them and plug them in on other screens to then bring up another screen to then start building out different tables for copays for different types of benefits. If you're going in for ocular treatment, if you're going in for transplant or whatever, they want to have different copays and other things tying into the overall member of responsibility.

There's just things that you can't just punch in certain numbers and they auto populate and ask you sometimes, "Do you want to use this for this additional group under a certain plan in line of business," whereas HealthEdge, from what I understand, it's a little more amenable to trying to remember and recall some of these inputs for setting up a line of business, a plan in all the subgroups.

There's less of this trying to go back in another screen or writing it down or having multiple screens at the same time and copy and pasting to set up the benefit structures, whereas in HealthEdge it has more of a

recall to say, "Do you want to copy this one or do you want to build this from scratch?"

Though SS&C and TriZetto, from what I've seen and known, you can go and find other similar plans that you've maybe built for, especially if, say, SS&C or TriZetto's hosting, meaning they're operationally managing the claim payments and the setup, you can go and search for other similar benefit structures through other clients and try to cheat your way efficiently to building out benefit structures. It's not doing so much of the recall, even if it's the same client.

That's just painful. People have to sit there and have multiple screens open. That's what I heard over and over again. Even working with Everest Group and Gartner and everyone else, that's one of the big complaints they were tracking too.

**Client**
You're saying that's for HealthEdge people need a lot of screens or for?

**Expert**
No, for SS&C, for TriZetto, even some of Oracle's platforms.

**Client**
You're saying HealthEdge, it's easier to set up a line of business or easier to set up a plan as long as it's not too complicated?

**Expert**
That is correct. As long as it's not too complicated, all the recall stuff and not having multiple screens, you get to avoid all that.

**Client**
That's because of this kind of natural language, HealthRules Payer dynamic, but it's more in English?

**Expert**
Yeah. From what I can see is because it's less monolithic in nature. I wish I had a screen so I could show you. With SS&C and TriZetto, it's like you have one screen. It's set up a line of business and it's got all these inputs. You set that up. Now, you got to go and set up a group. How many groups do you have? It's got certain information you want. Every time you set up a group, it's a new screen, same information, you tweak it a little bit differently per each group. Some of the stuff does remain the same at even the group level. It's like, why can't I just have it auto populate and then just go in there and tweak?

If there's 20 different dropdowns and free text fields, why can't I just go in the ones I know I need to change, but otherwise, it auto populates? It doesn't allow for that. There's some copied functions and stuff with TriZetto and whatnot, but then you got to go find the source information on one of five screens you already have open, whereas HealthEdge already has, from what I understand, some of that immediate recall that I'm describing here, where it's going to auto populate this, that, and then you decide if you want to keep it or not.

**Client**
Interesting. It sounds like the stuff that HealthEdge is better at is at the margin, winning out in the market. Is there other stuff? Is it really a UI UX difference or are there just capabilities that HealthEdge has by virtue of being next gen that the others don't?

**Expert**
Everything I heard, and this is what I had to keep going up against and was trying to fight the good fight here on was, we could never, SS&C, even though we had the robust back end, we could never get past, when we would do demos, the reactions from a UI UX standpoint. It was like, "Oh, this looks old. The colors look old," and it's like "Why does that matter? Does that impact operational efficiencies in any way?"

Yeah, it looks old. Older colors, great. The layout may be a little bit old, I'll definitely give you that. That could be an efficiency issue right there. At the end of the day, everybody was enamored with the UI UX for HealthEdge. It just looks more modern and looks great. It's like, "It's just like seeing a Tesla versus a 20-year-old Honda Civic." It's the same argument. Do you need the Tesla? What are you trying to solve for? "We got to make sure it crushes five million claims a day and does it accurately. If it finds an error claim, it doesn't stop the whole process, but yet it kicks it off to an off ramp and otherwise keeps processing."

HealthEdge, from what I understand, loading claims and doing all this other stuff, it has air issues where it'll stop a batch load of claims if it finds an error, whereas these other old, robust monolithic platforms are like, kick it out, keep the file going because they'll run these overnight. The problem is, where I'm going with this is when you were doing demos, you could never get to that part of the conversation with any potential health plan payer or whatnot.

Again, everything up front was the look, the feel, and the layout, and they were getting sold on that. I even ran into existing clients that we had at SS&C where one of their lines of business were on HealthEdge and they basically were telling us, again, "Yeah, you guys were right. The front end is wonderful, it looks great, easy to train people on, but it's the back end. It can't load as many claims as we can with these older platforms. It chokes on crunching through them, and we only find that out after implementation."

By the way, implementation costs are exponentially expensive for HealthEdge versus some of the older, less modern platforms. You take it in the shorts. The one statement I heard repeatedly, and I even heard it from Gartner and Everest Group and others that scan the CAPS market, was certain clients, especially if they are like smaller plans, mid-market, were really starting to question the value in the return that they were promised in terms of ROI when migrating to HealthEdge because the whole front end UI UX over time fizzles and fades and then the performative piece comes in and they're, like, "It's not keeping pace with what they promised."

**Client**
Interesting. HealthEdge is harder to implement, you're saying?

**Expert**
Probably yes and no, to be fair. Maybe. Why I'm saying that is because you have to understand that many of these plans and whatnot have other supporting platforms that often have to interact, or they have to pull data and information out of to make the ultimate future state HealthEdge platform function as it's supposed to at the end of the day.

A lot of integration work and stuff like that, it could be in some cases difficult, but definitely, in other cases, the theme that I had heard was they charge you through the nose for it. The implementation upfront costs, even what we were giving out for implementation costs, they were 2X, 3X, 4X what we were putting out there from SS&C, and certain payers were just like, "We're choking on just the implementation costs. We're still trying to figure out, is this it, or do we get to a point in the implementation, something new pops up, what happens, because we're not going to pay even more on top of what you've originally indicated."

**Client**
I would have thought that if it's a more cloud-based and a better UI that's easier to train on, that it would take less time and be cheaper to implement. It sounds like what you're saying is the opposite.

**Expert**
It is, because now, also, there could be the review. We're not cloud-based today. We've got it from our data warehouse, get you data and everything. You've got to feed stuff from your platform, whether we host or you host to our data center now. We can run performance reporting, all the other reporting that we need, payment information, whatever the case. Now, you've got to bring in the legal teams and say, "Well, wait a minute, we're not doing anything that's cloud-based now. Is this secure? How do we know it's secure? We have to do a complete compliance review of something that we're not familiar with now?"

That just takes more time, more money, versus if you're already going to a health plan that's already cloud-

based with a lot of their other adjacent platforms that need to interact or integrate with, say, the HealthEdge platform, it's going to be a much easier go in terms of the security and compliance review. All that has to happen up front too, before anyone signs on the dotted line, or right after they sign on the dotted line. That can be a big time suck and cost more money too, potentially.

**Client**
Where does all this shake out? Who's the share taker on that 30%-35% that needs to move?

**Expert**
My thought is, and I don't know who it's going to be, first of all. It could be TriZetto, but it's all going to be based on how they're going to frame up their solution and emphasis on solution errors. Gone are the days of point solutions. These health plans come to any of these vendors, and it's like, "Oh my gosh, litany of problems. Inefficiencies, too much manual overrides." You know what I mean? Can't batch load claims, can't run them over.

What you have to do is go back to the client and say, "That might be eight things that we package up in a basket, but it's just one solution." That's all anybody wants to hear about. I may have 10 micro problems, but you're giving me a macro solution. That's what the market's demanding, besides the point of like, "Hey, I also can't burn down the bank either. This has to be financially feasible. I also need to know that you're a company that is still going to continue to invest in this technology, not just sell it and then let it die in the vine."

I think there's some of that going on out there. It definitely was very apparent at SS&C. It's like they were just riding the business out for however many years they could and weren't willing to reinvest. I think whoever sizes up and frames up their solution in that capacity, which is one thing I was pushing, we were attempting to do at SS&C, but the one thing that I couldn't get leadership to do at SS&C was you don't have to go out there and necessarily try to directly sell against HealthEdge.

It's all about positioning. We knew they were doing this, and we heard the feedback where it's like, "We're the latest, greatest, awesome UI," because they knew they were selling on that. They didn't have to talk about their performative part, but it's like flip the script and go out there and say, "We're not trying to be a HealthEdge. We may not have the greatest UI UX, but look, you don't need it anyways. When we really distill what you need, client, at the end of the day, it really isn't the looks and the feel of it. It's really the performative part when you give us your laundry list of all the gripes with your current platform. They're performative issues."

If we can focus on that, we'll give you the tried and true 15-year-old Honda Civic that won't break the bank. Guess what? We still stay on top of all the emerging changes, whether it's regulatory or otherwise, that need to be incorporated in the platform. Bet your bottom dollar we'll continue to incorporate those. Again not break the bank. On the back end, from a performance standpoint, we'll still crush a lot of claims a day without issue. How does that sound?

I know it's a long-winded way to answer your question, but through all my research, in hearing everything from various clients out there, ones that had deep pockets and didn't, it's all about getting to understanding their needs, what the solution's going to be, and how you're going to package up and position it.

If somebody out there other than HealthEdge can do what I just said, I think they have a really good shot at that remaining 30%-35%, not to mention who's going to actually start using AI for the reasons that could benefit any of these legacy platforms, even if they're cloud-based or not, without having to completely throw the baby out with the bathwater and completely rebuild the platforms.

There's ways to use AI even with older coding to overcome some of those legacy issues with some of these older platforms, which DST ran into that. They tried to build a platform 10 years ago. In theory, it was great and it was all going to be Java-based, but the execution of it was terrible and they could barely move 1,000 claims through it without it coughing.

It sounds like what you're saying is on the first pain point, parking the AI topic for a second, in terms of solving the pain points in an all-in-one platform as opposed to point solutions.

**Expert**
Correct.

**Client**
It sounds like HealthEdge is doing that. Are they doing a better job at that than everyone else? Are others doing that as well?

**Expert**
I don't know. They may be doing a better job. I know their marketing is better at and more adept at expressing that they can be more of that one-stop shop because they also combine their clinical management and, "Hey, all the eligibility and the benefits set up is fully encased in our HealthRules platform. If you want clinical management, we have this other platform," but they symbiotically work together so no additional cost incurred to integrate them.

**Client**
It sounds like what you were describing is look, these legacy monolithic platforms, they're not as flexible and they don't look as good, but they're really robust. Functionality is still very strong. I'm wondering if that is starting to change. One reason you mentioned was maybe AI. Is that a paradigm shift such that everyone needs to modernize?

**Expert**
That's a yes. From my perspective, yes. To me, AI is going to be that ability to leapfrog or launch any one of these older monolithic platforms, maybe more into a HealthEdge realm without having to completely rebuild the ship. To me, it's cost prohibitive to, probably at this juncture, rebuild the ship not knowing the ultimate benefits of AI in the future. The business could probably lose its shirt in two to three years if you went down that path. Trying to get a new platform to match HealthEdge, you won't be in business in two, three years is my view.

**Client**
You're saying it's too expensive for a payer or for a legacy vendor to rebuild the ship, to make it AI-relevant?

**Expert**
No. To try to match HealthEdge in its current state, you'd be better off trying to use maybe one of these older aged platforms to try to get to a HealthEdge state or better through leveraging the values and virtues of AI.

**Client**
Interesting. You're saying that AI could allow the legacy platforms to catch up?

**Expert**
Yes, potentially.

**Client**
Interesting. It's not that AI forces people to migrate, forces payers to migrate onto a modern platform. You're saying AI can be an accelerant for the old systems to bridge the gap?

**Expert**
Correct.

**Client**
Interesting. Can you just expand on that? That was counterintuitive for me.

**Expert**
A lot of with AI, where there's inefficiencies from the human being UI UX experience, you can create machine learning capabilities to mimic the more complex tasks that a human being is undertaking. If you had developers focusing on building the AI machine learning capabilities that a human is otherwise undertaking today, you likely could, over time, take, from a human capacity standpoint, those more complex tasks off the table, as well as some of the errors and other related issues.

It's not going to be instant because as we've seen in other pockets and other industries, even in healthcare, quite frankly, where the machine learning still is immature in certain ways, or it's missing certain baseline information to do a better job at trying to mimic a human being in terms of its decision making as it learns over time.

It's going to get there. Just think, two years ago, we weren't even really talking about any of this. Think two years from now. The machine learning, when specifically applied to the healthcare space, imagine what it's going to be able to do. I actually got to look at a lot of the stuff even when I was at SS&C because we had RPA tools that are all rules-based. Hardened rules, they're very rigid.

If you took the rigid rules and went beyond that, and went to more machine learning-based rules in decision making. A lot of these health plans too are like, even if it's homegrown, they're like, "We've done as much RPA we can. It's reached a tipping point," and it's like "Why not AI? Why couldn't AI take over?"

**Client**
I was under the impression that just AI is more useful or easier to implement in a cloud-based system and that that would create another layer of advantage for the next-gen platforms. It sounds like you're saying that's not the case?

**Expert**
It could be. It definitely is in a more cloud-based. Even SS&C AMISYS is cloud-based. It's monolithic and old, but it's cloud-based. Like we were just talking about, all the benefits set up and stuff like that, there were some RPA tools to drive certain rules to say when this is set up, then do this, or when you pull this in, when you set this up, make sure the file gets always pulled in and then updates this table every month right at this time.

There's other aspects of the platform where RPA tools were not going to satisfy the setup requirements. In my view and others' views, AI could be that solution because otherwise today, those other screens that RPA or robotics can't support effectively, AI could with machine learning. You just got to build it. Again, it's already in the cloud. If we think that's great, great, it's already in the cloud, but what we're trying to solve for is the inefficiencies. That's the stick in the mud, every conversation when you're going up against HealthEdge.

It's like, "Well, we can overcome these. If you want it to look beautiful, we'll make it look beautiful. It's more of the UX, the experience part, so what, this drop down may not be in the most ideal spot to plug this in. It doesn't matter anymore because we're employing AI. As long as you give AI, these inputs on the front end, there's no more humans involved, so who cares?"

**Client**
Getting back to the comment that you made about how 1/3 of the industry is going to be up for grabs, like 30%-35% jump balls, how much of that is homegrown systems versus legacy TriZetto and SS&C instances?

**Expert**
I'm going to say probably, maybe somewhere between maybe 15%-18% is my best guess or guesstimation.

**Client**
Is homegrown? Roughly half of that is homegrown?

**Expert**
That's my take. Again, these are from what I've observed, like the hospital systems that a lot of them were like, "Yep, it's homegrown." I was like, "Whoa, really? Okay." They're a hybrid. They may be an existing old TriZetto platform, but it's not supported by Cognizant who owns TriZetto. They don't support it because we went off on our own 15 years ago and started doing custom coding and hard coding things to meet our specific business needs.

Once you do that with a lot of these vendors, especially if the payer is hosting it, other than basic support, they don't provide any other related support because they're like, "We don't have access to your custom code, and we're not going to be responsible for it." I saw evidence of that too, where it's TriZetto, but it doesn't look anything like TriZetto. Cognizant doesn't support us at all because we went off the rails 10 years ago and completely customized it.

**Client**
Interesting. Curious what you think of HealthEdge has acquired these other payer solutions. One is the prepay first and second pass payer integrity. There's a care coordination set of modules and then there's a provider data management module. Just curious what you think of those and where they have a right to win among those three.

**Expert**
I think some of them, the Payment Integrity a good offense defensive solution. It's weird because I had this conversation with somebody else last week because they were like, "Why would you need Payment Integrity?" Usually, it's because whatever system a payer is using, somebody doesn't believe that they're paying things accurately or setting up things accurately. A third-party payment integrity company is hired with their solution, and they evaluate what's really going on.

At the end of the day it's like, "Yeah, sure, but why not just build that in? Whether you say you have it built into your platform and processes or not, you just have it, and you have that peace of mind, and you just take that off the table." That becomes a selling point, and then it's less of an argument about, "Well, you just don't have a modern platform or your platform wasn't built to do that." It's like, "No, we actually have a module that evaluates the integrity of how successfully everything's paid." Again, it takes it off the table, selling point.

The other one is like the provider part you're talking about. I see the upside there because it's starting to streamline, if you will, in a more efficient, effective way, everything in the ecosystem from services provided, claim being created at the provider side, submitting it to a payer system to then be processed. Why do you have to have separate platforms in the market to build a claim, transmit it, receive it, and then pay it? Why can't that just be?

**Client**
I don't know that HealthEdge, and you correct me if I'm wrong about this, I don't think they're actually doing anything on the provider side. I think they're doing care management, where payers want to manage the high-risk patients.

**Expert**
They do have a management module. That was I think one of the first things that they kicked off before, if I remember correctly, their history before they got into the claim space. Definitely, clinical management makes all the sense in the world. That's a huge focus for pretty much any payer out there like you just stated. I worked in that space.

**Client**
Again, I've never worked in a payer, so my impression is the payment integrity business, that almost smells

like a CAPS functionality. That feels like it makes a ton of sense to integrate because it's part of that workflow of receiving claims and processing them and analyzing them and making sure they're right and everything. The care management piece, I get why that's important, but I just would have thought that smells like a different function and maybe a different buyer persona within the payer. Is the CAPS vendor the best person to sell that piece of software versus a Cotiviti or whoever else is doing that?

**Expert**
I'd say yes and no. I got to evaluate the clinical management or UM, utilization management platforms because we replaced ours at SS&C as well instead of rebuilding it. I've been at United where I was part of the population health side of things where clinical management is important, crucial to everything you do in population health. Yes, different personas, buying personas, let's put it that way. It's just described.

You're going to go to the whole clinical side of the business when you're talking about utilization management, clinical management-type platforms, less to the IT that are focused on just pure claim payment. They're definitely integrated in multiple ways these days. Multiple ways, all the way from the benefits setup. Some of them have requirements that you have to be in a population health management program to maybe have your claim paid at a higher copay level.

All of that has to be interwoven together in various ways as well as for just tracking downstream for both pre-sales and identifying certain subgroups that could benefit from clinical management as well as then having the data on the back end between claims to identify who did what, what their outcomes look like so you can actually create performance-based reporting. To answer your part of the question, it then makes sense for these claim-type vendors to have a clinical management component.

What I will say in evaluating this market, both markets during my time at SS&C, I don't know if there's any one vendor who's a complete rock star on both sides of those tracks, meaning the claim side as well as the clinical management, and when it's joined up. Nobody can hold a candle to them. It seems like because of whether they're, I'll call them legacy CAPS or clinical management vendors or newcomers, they usually started on one side of the track or the other but typically didn't start from day one saying, "We're going to be a claims processing platform we're going to build and clinical management and we're both building them at the same time."

Usually, one came before the other, and that's where you see the strength usually leaning one way or the other. One platform is more of the, "We lead selling claims. The more complementary thing we can bring along with," in the case of HealthEdge "is now the clinical, or probably the opposite maybe in certain ways, the clinical management piece is more of our bread and butter. That's where our roots, the roots of the business come from."

**Client**
Just getting back to that 30%-35% of the industry that's up for grabs. Who do you think wins what share of that? If today, let's say 1/3 of the industry is homegrown, it sounds like 1/3 is TriZetto, maybe 20% is HealthEdge, and the rest is shared. How do you think that looks in five to seven years? Who are going to be the big gainers and by how much?

**Expert**
Barring or putting AI aside, I would say probably HealthEdge is going to be one of the biggest winners potentially if they stay on the focused investment track that they've been on. They also have to deal with the down market, what I just discussed a few minutes ago, which is how do you package your solution? It may look like function in maybe improving the back end in terms of processing claims like a Tesla, but how do you package it up as a mini Tesla? These clients that don't have the deep pockets, it's not an attainable market if you don't figure out how to right size your solution to meet their needs.

**Client**
Right. It sounds like what you're saying is TriZetto and HealthEdge are really strong at the top of the market?

Correct.

**Client**
Maybe for these regional payers with small networks, they need something more cost effective?

**Expert**
That's correct, yes. The other thing too is some of these groups, HealthEdge also does a pretty good job having a BPO sort of model. That's beneficial. I know that because that appeals to mid-, small-market clients too. We were proposing this even at SS&C where one client is like, "Our infrastructure is outdated. It doesn't matter if you migrate us off your oldest platform and put it on your more modern AMISYS platform, guys. We got to spend money on infrastructure to do anything. We just don't have the money. We also realize the lights are going to be out in three or four years if we don't do something."

How do you solve that issue for certain plans? Help them keep their business alive, and you don't break the bank at the same time, and you don't over modernize things that they don't have the need for it. Again, right sizing your product offering to them.

**Client**
You're saying SS&C does a better job at that than HealthEdge?

**Expert**
SS&C, we were willing to do a better job of that on top of to help with the infrastructure part. It was like, "Why don't we just host and operationalize the platform?" Meaning we'll provide the staff. We'll have staff that actually process your claims. You don't have to hire them. HealthEdge has that capability. I just don't know how hard they lean into that model.

At SS&C it was something like I think a majority of the business, from an operational standpoint of any health plan, we were the operational team, so we hosted the platform, and then we were the operation. It was a BPO or BPaaS model. HealthEdge, I know TriZetto that they have that ability. I just don't know how much they lean into that from a selling point standpoint. That was definitely something that we took pride in at SS&C and it was something that we did a bang up job at it at the same time.

**Client**
What's your sense of just TriZetto's position in the market? I've heard it both ways. One that it's just a very powerful platform, very trusted, very robust. I've heard it the other way that Cognizant isn't really investing in it, and it's getting older every year, and it's just a matter of time before there are a bunch of migrations.

**Expert**
That's what I've heard too. I was seeing that too, where it was like, wait a minute, a lot of the Blues plans are getting off of TriZetto, and I hear people even at SS&C that worked at different Blues plans. They were like, "Yeah, the Blues plans for the last 20 years were just in bed with TriZetto completely."

I think over time, to your point, they probably could be potentially bigger losers just because there's the lack of investment. Like I said, but if you use AI and do it in a smart way, the allergic reaction that many of the CAPS vendors are having is, if you have to change your code base, if you have to go to a more modularized architectural structure, which is what a lot of the more modern platforms are built in that modularized structure, that's time, that's money.

You could build it and you may find out in two years you built something that the market's already passed you by because the technology has passed you by. AI, if someone used it in a proper way, you didn't need to go and pay a bunch of people to build all these different things when you can create AI to just operationally do a bunch of different workarounds.

**Client**
Interesting. Are you saying that AI will just make it easier for in-house IT to extend the useful life of some of

these legacy platforms, or it's going to be make it easier for the TriZettos of the world to modernize and make some of their legacy?

**Expert**
Both, because even with coding, right now, from a coding standpoint, AI machine learning is great if it's just a simple binary throw it at a standard code base, and ask it to write certain code without knowing up a distinct platform. If it's very blasé, it'll kick it out. Imagine if you train it on a specific platform, so that starts to understand the coding in the architectural structure. If you start doing that, your ability to write features, develop features, and deploy them, and then QA them, the speed to do that should exponentially improve, as well as the documentation, everything you need.

You take so many humans that exist out of the equation that do all of those things today, and as long as having it local or cloud server-based, and it's not the information, data, and function capacity isn't the limit, then AI, in that case, the sky's the limit here. Its functional power will overtake any of the shortcomings of old code bases and any other thing, or even if you want to put new code-based and create crosswalks potentially to old hard-coded stuff.

Once you get that out of the way instead of trying to rebuild it on a new code code base, and you don't have to tinker hopefully with the old code base much, you've solved your main problem because that's what a lot of these old legacy platforms are dealing with. It's an old code base and people are aging out of the workforce who even understand the coding like COBOL and others. For what it is, it's still a very solid code base. Also, probably from a security standpoint, who's going to be around in the future that knows how to break into it?

I'm being funny there, but hopefully that helps give you a picture of where AI could help a TriZetto finally leapfrog without stopping and saying, "We got to completely rebuild this just to catch up with a HealthEdge." It's like, "No, you may not have to. You can just build on top of this."
