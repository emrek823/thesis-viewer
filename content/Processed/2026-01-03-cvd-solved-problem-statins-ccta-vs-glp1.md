# Two Paths to Eliminating Cardiovascular Disease: Aggressive Lipid Lowering vs GLP-1s at Scale

**The Take:** Both theses are valid but address *different segments* of the CVD problem. Statins + CCTA targets *atherosclerotic plaque* directly via lipid lowering and early detection. GLP-1s target *metabolic dysfunction* that drives plaque formation. They're **complementary, not competing**—and both are investable.

**Key Insight:** The "CVD is solved" argument from the Total Health Optimization article is *technically correct but practically incomplete*. Aggressive LDL reduction to <30 mg/dL likely prevents CVD in young, healthy adults who start early. But:
1. Most people don't start at 25—they start at 55 with decades of plaque
2. Existing plaque needs *detection and management*, not just LDL lowering
3. GLP-1s appear to reduce MACE through mechanisms *independent of weight loss* (only 1/3 of benefit is weight-dependent per recent Lancet analysis)

**Investment Framing:**
- **Statins + CCTA thesis** = infrastructure play on *existing disease detection and management*
- **GLP-1s thesis** = platform play on *upstream prevention of metabolic drivers*

## The "CVD Solved" Argument

From [Total Health Optimization](https://totalhealthoptimization.com/2025/09/27/cardiovascular-disease-is-a-solved-problem/):

**Core Claim:** For young adults without established atherosclerosis, aggressive LDL reduction essentially eliminates CVD risk.

**Protocol Proposed:**
- Start moderate-intensity statins (rosuvastatin preferred—doesn't cross BBB)
- Add ezetimibe for combination therapy
- Consider PCSK9 inhibitors for further reduction
- Target: LDL <30 mg/dL, ideally toward 10 mg/dL

**Evidence Cited:**
- Mendelian randomization proves LDL causality (genetic variants with lower lifetime LDL = dramatically lower CVD)
- PCSK9 loss-of-function mutations = "up to 90% lower risk of cardiovascular disease"
- IMPROVE-IT: LDL <30 mg/dL showed no adverse events over 6 years
- FOURIER: LDL <10 mg/dL showed no adverse events over 2.2 years
- "No plateau in cardiovascular benefits observed"

**Author's Personal Implementation:**
- 10 mg rosuvastatin reduced LDL from ~90 to 50 mg/dL
- Plans to add ezetimibe to reach ~30 mg/dL
- Claims "zero discernible side effects"

**The Limitation:** Article proposes *no imaging protocol* (CAC scoring, CCTA). Pure pharmacological approach assumes you're preventing plaque formation, not detecting existing plaque.

## The Missing Piece: Detection of Existing Disease

From [[The Big Shift in Cardiology to Atheroma and Inflammation]] (Eric Topol):

**Key Paradigm Shift:** Cardiology moving from "blockages" (obstructive disease) to "atheroma" (vulnerable plaque) and inflammation.

**The Detection Gap:**
- Heart attacks mostly originate from *non-obstructive* disease (mild by angiogram)
- Vulnerable plaque features: thin fibrous cap, lipid-rich necrotic core, inflammation
- **"Unlike stable plaque, the vulnerable plaque does not contain dense calcification"** — calcium scoring misses the dangerous plaques

**AI Cardiac Imaging Companies (all FDA-cleared):**
| Company | Approach | Validation |
|---------|----------|------------|
| Cleerly | Plaque features | Clinical event validation |
| HeartFlow | Fluid dynamics + 3D | Clinical event validation |
| Elucid | Plaque composition | Histology (no event data) |
| Caristo | Fat attenuation index (inflammation) | **Linked to cardiac mortality** |

**CARISTO Data (40,000 patients, 10-year follow-up):**
- 1 inflamed artery = **13x higher death risk** vs no inflamed arteries
- This is the only tech thus far linked to cardiac mortality

**Medicare Reimbursement:**
- CMS now pays **>$1,000 per AI cardiac CT interpretation**
- 5x more for AI interpretation than the scan itself
- 5 of 7 MACs have approved coverage
- **93.6 million Medicare/MA beneficiaries now have access**

**Topol's Critique:** "Far too much fixation on just the atheroma instead of on the high-risk patient." Need multi-layer risk assessment: PRS, proteins, inflammation markers, imaging.

## GLP-1s: The Metabolic Intervention

From vault thesis [[GLP-1 at 25% Adoption Restructures American Healthcare and Consumer Economy]]:

**Scale:**
- 12.4% of US adults currently on GLP-1s (Gallup)
- Thesis projects 25% adoption (50-65M Americans) by end of 2026
- Drug spend: **$65-70B annually**

**CVD Mechanism (distinct from weight loss):**
From Lancet mediation analysis: **Only ~1/3 of GLP-1 cardiovascular benefit is weight-dependent**

From Topol's article: "GLP-1 drugs have already been shown to reduce heart attacks in people with obesity... we recently learned that only about a third of the benefit was weight-loss dependent."

**This is critical:** GLP-1s aren't just preventing CVD by reducing obesity. They have *direct anti-inflammatory and cardioprotective effects*.

**Scope Beyond CVD:**
- Diabetes remission
- NASH/MASLD
- Sleep apnea
- Kidney disease
- Osteoarthritis
- Cancer (emerging data)

## Head-to-Head Comparison

| Dimension | Statins + CCTA | GLP-1s |
|-----------|---------------|--------|
| **Target** | LDL + existing plaque detection | Metabolic dysfunction + inflammation |
| **When to start** | Ideally <30 years old | Any age (works even with existing disease) |
| **Reversibility** | Statins: continuous; CCTA: periodic | Continuous (weight regain on cessation) |
| **Side effects** | Myopathy 1.5-5%; statin intolerance ~10% | GI (nausea, gastroparesis); muscle loss |
| **Cost** | Statins: $10-50/month; CCTA+AI: $1,000+ per scan | $500-1,000/month (dropping to ~$150 with Medicare deal) |
| **Adherence** | High (daily pill) | 14% 3-year persistence (major problem) |
| **Visibility** | None (no visible change) | High (rapid body composition change) |
| **Current adoption** | 1 in 4 Americans on statins | 12.4% on GLP-1s |
| **CVD mechanism** | LDL reduction → plaque stabilization | Multi-pathway: anti-inflammatory, metabolic, ? direct cardiac |

**Key Insight:** Statins have high adherence because they're cheap, daily, and invisible. GLP-1s have low persistence because they're expensive, injectable (until oral), and patients stop when they reach goal weight.

## Where Your Theses Overlap

**From [[Medicare Reimbursement Unlocks AI Cardiac Imaging—Preventive Cardiology Becomes Standard Care by 2028]]:**

Bear case bullet: **"GLP-1s reduce cardiac events. If GLP-1 adoption reduces MACE events by 15-20%, demand for preventive cardiac imaging may plateau as the at-risk population shrinks."**

This is the key interaction. If GLP-1s dramatically reduce the *metabolic drivers* of atherosclerosis, the population needing CCTA screening shrinks. But:

1. **GLP-1s don't eliminate existing plaque** — people who start at 50 with 30 years of plaque still need detection
2. **GLP-1s have 14% persistence** — many will cycle on/off, accumulating damage between cycles
3. **CCTA can identify who needs aggressive intervention** — patients with high-risk plaque should be on GLP-1s + statins + potentially PCSK9i

**The synthesis:** CCTA identifies the vulnerable; GLP-1s + statins treat them. Not competing—*stratifying*.

## Limitations of "CVD Solved" Argument

**From JACC study on risk screening limitations:**
- 45-61% of MI patients would NOT have been recommended for statin therapy or imaging based on ASCVD/PREVENT scores if evaluated 2 days before their event
- 60% of patients experienced no symptoms until within 48 hours of event
- 72% of young MI patients had low calculated risk scores

**Implication:** Risk calculators fail. They don't identify vulnerable patients. CCTA with AI plaque analysis is the upgrade—it finds disease, not just estimates risk.

**From DANCAVAS 2 trial (comprehensive CVD screening in men 60-64):**
- Being invited to screening did NOT significantly reduce death
- Statin initiation 44.3% vs 30.3% (screening arm vs control)
- MACE and CV death similar across groups
- **Higher severe bleeding in screening group** (overtreatment harm)

**Implication:** Universal screening may not reduce mortality if it just leads to more medication without targeting. Need *precision* (high-risk plaque identification), not *volume* (screen everyone).

## Investment Implications

### Cleerly Specifically

**Bullish signals:**
- Medicare reimbursement live at >$1,000/scan
- UHC + Cigna coverage effective Oct 1, 2025
- CPT Category I code secured (permanent recognition)
- 93.6M beneficiaries now have access
- Topol thesis: paradigm shifting from blockages to atheroma

**Bearish signals:**
- Clinical outcomes not yet proven (Medicare reimbursing before validation)
- STAT News headline: "Medicare Will Pay for AI Heart Scans That Haven't Proven They Work"
- GLP-1 adoption could shrink addressable market
- Physician workflow resistance to imaging-first protocols

**Verdict:** Cleerly is a **reimbursement-unlocked infrastructure bet**, not a clinical validation bet. The technology is commodity (4 companies FDA-cleared). The moat is distribution + workflow integration.

### GLP-1 Adjacent Plays

**Cleerly could be *additive* to GLP-1 thesis:**
- GLP-1 patients need baseline cardiac assessment
- Serial CCTA could monitor plaque regression on GLP-1s
- From Springer review: "Serial CCTA is valuable for monitoring lipid-lowering therapy effects on plaque progression"

**Opportunity:** GLP-1 + statin + CCTA monitoring as *integrated preventive cardiology protocol*

---

## Contradictions & Open Questions

1. **Does aggressive LDL lowering work if you already have plaque?**
   - Yes for stabilization, less clear for regression
   - CCTA may be needed to monitor

2. **Will GLP-1s cannibalize CCTA demand?**
   - Probably not near-term (existing plaque population is huge)
   - Long-term: if GLP-1 prevention works, at-risk population shrinks

3. **What's the right screening population?**
   - Universal: likely harmful (DANCAVAS 2)
   - Risk-targeted: fails (45-61% of MIs missed by risk scores)
   - Symptom-based: fails (60% asymptomatic until 48 hrs before event)
   - **PRS + biomarker + imaging multi-layer** (Topol's recommendation)

---

## Recommendations

1. **Hold both theses** — They're complementary, not competing. GLP-1s = upstream metabolic prevention. CCTA = downstream detection of existing disease.

2. **Update cardiac imaging thesis** — Add GLP-1 interaction as key dynamic. CCTA's future may be *monitoring* plaque on GLP-1/statin therapy, not just *screening* for disease.

3. **Watch Cleerly's outcome studies** — The bear case (no outcomes benefit) would be thesis-breaking. 2027-2028 is the validation window.

4. **Investigate combination protocol plays** — Companies building GLP-1 + statin + CCTA integrated pathways. Preventive cardiology as a *stack*, not siloed interventions.

**Bull case:** GLP-1s + CCTA + aggressive lipid therapy become standard preventive cardiology protocol. MACE drops 40%+ in treated populations. Both theses validated.

**Bear case:** GLP-1 persistence stays <20%, CCTA outcomes studies fail, and prevention reverts to cheap statins alone. Neither thesis reaches full potential.
