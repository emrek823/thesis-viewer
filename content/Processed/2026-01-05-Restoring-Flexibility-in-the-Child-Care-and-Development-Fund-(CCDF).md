## Abstract
The Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children and Families proposes to amend the Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) regulations (45 CFR part 98) to reduce costs and burden for states and territories administering the CCDF program. It proposes rescinding the requirements to limit family co-payments to 7 percent of family income, to provide some direct services through grants or contracts, to pay providers based on child's enrollment, and to pay providers prospectively that were added to the CCDF regulations in the March 2024 final rule, Improving Child Care Access, Affordability, and Stability in the Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) (89 FR 15366). The docket on https://www.regulations.gov will include a plain language summary of the NPRM as required by 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(4).
