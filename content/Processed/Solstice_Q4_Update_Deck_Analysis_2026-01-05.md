## Deck Comparison: Dec 28 → Jan 5

### Structural Changes
| Aspect | Dec 28 | Jan 5 |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Total slides | 20 | 16 |
| Appendix | 5 slides | Removed |
| New content | — | Defensibility slide added |

### Key Improvements
1. **Market sizing now surgical** - $12B content execution TAM vs vague $20B
2. **Defensibility story added** - Data flywheel at brand + company level
3. **Expansion math explicit** - $500K → $3M+ → $10M+ ACV progression
4. **Competitive framing smarter** - Less trash talk, more "built for pharma"
5. **Roadmap has timeline** - Today → 10 year vision

### Strategy Doc Concerns Addressed
| Concern | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Agency risk / productization | ✅ New defensibility slide |
| Expansion clarity | ✅ ACV ladder added |
| Roadmap timeline | ✅ Staged progression |
| Head of Sales hire | ❌ Still open |
| Whale concentration | ❌ Not addressed |
| Margin visibility | ❌ Not in deck |

## Email → Deck Gap Analysis

### Proof Points IN EMAIL but NOT IN DECK

| Proof Point | Impact | Recommendation |
|-------------|--------|----------------|
| Phathom dropped AOR (MRM/Omnicom) | Proves productization | Add as case study |
| Alexion $25K → $350K expansion | 14x growth story | Add to GTM slide |
| AstraZeneca $5M+ whale potential | Shows path to $15M | Name in deck |
| Sanofi 3-contract expansion | Multi-brand proof | Add to expansion slide |

### Metrics Gaps

| Metric | Email | Deck | Action |
|--------|-------|------|--------|
| Q1 target ($4M) | ✅ | ❌ | Add milestone |
| Cash position | $1.21M | Not shown | Keep out (tight runway) |
| Engagement lead ratio | 1:3-5 clients | Not specified | Add to model slide |

---

## Critical Issue: $15M Target Math Doesn't Work on Expansion Alone

### The Claim
From Q4 email:
> "We believe we can hit our goal of $15M ARR by years end even if we stopped external sales and continued to just serve the clients we currently have"

### The Math

| Current State | Amount |
|---------------|--------|
| Contracted ARR | $2.32M |
| FY2026 Target | $15M |
| **Gap to Fill** | **$12.68M** |

This requires **5.5x growth** from existing customers in 12 months.

### Why Expansion-Only Fails

**1. The AstraZeneca Whale is 2027, Not 2026**

The email explicitly states:
> "This makes AstraZeneca a potential $5M+ contract **for 2027** if we can just continue our expansion"

Even their biggest expansion opportunity isn't expected to materialize this year. Realistic AZ contribution for 2026: $1-2M (not $5M).

**2. Sanofi Can't 10x in One Year**

- Current Sanofi: $636K (3 contracts)
- Sanofi has 50+ brands, but pharma expansion is constrained by:
  - Annual budget cycles (most 2026 budgets already allocated)
  - Internal champion bandwidth (one marketing director can only push so many initiatives)
  - Competitive displacement takes time (existing agencies have relationships)
- Realistic Sanofi 2026: $1.5-2M (3x, aggressive)

**3. Small Biotechs Have Ceilings**

| Customer | Current | Max Realistic 2026 | Constraint |
|----------|---------|-------------------|------------|
| Phathom | $100K | $200K | Single commercial brand |
| Nuvation | $300K | $500K | One launched product |
| Ardelyx | $395K | $600K | Limited portfolio |
| Incyte | $11K | $100K | Pilot stage |

These accounts can't become whales - they don't have enough brands.

**4. Capacity Bottleneck**

- Current: 1 engagement lead per 3-5 clients
- To support 5.5x ARR growth, need 5.5x client work
- Either hire aggressively (burns cash faster) or productize faster (unproven)
- First dedicated engagement lead (Vicky) just started

**5. Budget Cycle Reality**

Pharma marketing budgets are set Q4 for following year. Expanding mid-2026 means:
- Asking brand teams to reallocate from existing agency commitments
- Or waiting for 2027 budget cycle
- Exception: launch brands with flexible budgets (but these are rare)

### Realistic Expansion Scenario

| Customer | Current | Realistic 2026 | Notes |
|----------|---------|----------------|-------|
| AstraZeneca/Alexion | $670K | $1.5M | Camizestrant launch + 1-2 more brands |
| Sanofi | $636K | $1.5M | 2-3 more brands, aggressive |
| UCB | $292K | $600K | 2x reasonable |
| Ipsen | $180K | $400K | 2x reasonable |
| Others | $542K | $1M | Modest growth |
| **Total Expansion** | $2.32M | **$5-6M** | |

**Gap still requiring new logos: $9-10M**

### What They Actually Need

To hit $15M with realistic expansion ($5-6M), they need **$9-10M from new logos**.

| Path | New Logos Needed | Avg ACV | Feasibility |
|------|------------------|---------|-------------|
| Many small deals | 18-20 | $500K | Hard - no sales leader, founder-led only |
| Balanced | 10-12 | $800K | Possible if Q1-Q2 pipeline converts |
| Whale-dependent | 2-3 | $3-4M | Risky - long sales cycles |

### Virtue's Position

**We should push back on the "expansion-only" narrative.** Questions to raise:

1. "Your email says AZ is a $5M opportunity for 2027. What's the realistic 2026 number?"

2. "What's your new logo pipeline? The deck shows founder-led sales with no Head of Sales hired."

3. "If expansion is 60% of the path to $15M, what's the other 40%? Show us the pipeline."

4. "Budget cycles: How many of your expansion targets have 2026 budget authority vs. requiring 2027 planning?"

### Recommended Deck Change

Current GTM slide says:
> "We can get to $50mm ARR with our current clients and current product"

**Should say:**
> "Path to $15M: $5-6M expansion from current customers + $9-10M from 10-15 new logos"

This is more credible and shows they understand the real math.

## Recommendations for Final Deck

### Must Add
1. **Phathom case study** - "Replaced AOR with Solstice" is strongest proof point
2. **Alexion expansion numbers** - $25K → $350K is 14x story
3. **Name the whale** - "AstraZeneca potential $5M+ in 2027"
4. **Explicit logos** on slide 2 (Sanofi, AZ, Alexion, UCB)
5. **Q1 milestone** - "$4M ARR by end of Q1"

### Should Fix
1. **Team slide framing** - Lead with strengths, not "10000x ideas that haven't worked"
2. **"Your Bet" slide** - Reframe as "What We've Proven / What We'll Prove"
3. **Engagement lead ratio** - Add current (1:3-5) vs target (1:10+)

### Questions for Solstice Before Series A
1. What % of ARR is platform-delivered vs engagement-lead-delivered?
2. Sanofi: 3 brands signed - what's realistic timeline for remaining 38+ brands?
3. AstraZeneca whale: what's the gating factor to $5M+?
4. With $1.2M cash and Jan 12 kickoff, what's the backup plan if raise takes 6+ months?
5. **$15M math:** Your email says expansion-only can hit $15M, but AZ whale is 2027. Walk us through the 2026 math - how much from expansion vs. new logos?
6. **New logo pipeline:** What's in the funnel? Takeda and Pfizer mentioned - what stage and expected close timing?
7. **Head of Sales:** When will this role be filled? Founder-led sales can't scale to 15+ new logos.
