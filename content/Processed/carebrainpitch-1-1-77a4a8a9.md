## Slide 1: Carebrain - Title Slide

# Carebrain
Use your brain to help patients. Let ours do the rest.

ai-powered hospital management ai-powered electronic health record & hospital management platform

## Slide 2: The Problem with Legacy EHRs

The person you love most was admitted to the hospital in critical condition. Would you want the team saving their life relying on software from the 90s?

---

**! UNHAPPY EMPLOYEES, LAWSUITS**
*   **X 50%**
*   of doctors think their Electronic Health Record (EHR)...
    *   detracts from clinical effectiveness
    *   is not personalized to their role
    *   makes them use paper workarounds
    *   cannot identify high-risk patients

---

**! MEDICAL ERRORS, PATIENT DEATH**
*   **X 60%**
*   of doctors think hospital EHRs need a complete overhaul
    *   cannot effectively change or adapt
    *   are not ready for payment reform

---

**! LOST REVENUE, UNBEARABLE COSTS**
*   **X 70%**
*   of doctors think their Electronic Health Record (EHR)...
    *   contributes greatly to burnout
    *   has a very poorly designed interface
    *   takes away valuable patient time
    *   is not effectively interoperable

## Slide 3: Clinicians Spend More Time on Computers Than with Patients

82% of clinicians aren't satisfied with their EHR... because they're so cumbersome that they force clinicians to spend more time on computers than with patients!

**Time Distribution per Patient**
*   **Hospital-based clinicians spend 37 minutes on each patient, 25 of which are in the EHR.**
    *   12m: with patient during visit
    *   10m: with EHR outside visit
    *   15m: with EHR during visit

## Slide 4: Carebrain is the Cure - Mobile Interface

## Slide 13: How Legacy EHRs "Think" vs. How Carebrain Thinks

---
**How legacy EHRs... "think"**
Yes, they think, just not about you.
*(Image: Lumpy, grey brain)*

*   How can we become the #1 EHR in U.S. academic hospitals?
*   How can we make our software this hospital's #1 priority?
*   How can we squeeze every penny out of this quarter?
*   How can we maximize time spent in our software?
*   How can we keep our software as ugly as possible?
*   How can we make it really hard to integrate with us?

**How Carebrain thinks**
We put clinicians first.
*(Image: Dark, textured brain)*

*   How can we become the #1 hospital software in the world?
*   How can we help this hospital run as smoothly as possible?
*   How can we grow our happy users & profit in the long run?
*   How can we maximize time spent with patients?
*   How can we make our software as elegant as possible?
*   How can we make it super easy to integrate with us?
