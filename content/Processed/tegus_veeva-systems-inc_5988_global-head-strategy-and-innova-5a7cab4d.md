# Veeva Systems Inc - Global Head, Strategy, and Innovation, Data Operations at Novartis

Interview conducted on May 20, 2020

## Topics
Clinical Research, Pharma Industry, Veeva, Data Security, Competition, Vendor Selection, Data Integration

## Summary
A Tegus Client inquires about the differences between IQVIA and Veeva, both built on top of Salesforce, from an investment perspective. The Global Head of Strategy and Innovation, Data Operations at Novartis explains that while they may look similar, they have different use cases and are different slices of a broader landscape of technology. IQVIA is more of a data asset company and a service provider, while Veeva is a proper software company. The biggest difference between the two is that Veeva has an electronic data capture platform that is the fundamental foundational clinical data use case, whereas IQVIA does not. The expert believes that one of the companies will acquire the other or merge because there is a lot of complimentary stuff there. The conversation also touched on the importance of personal relationships in choosing service providers and the value of having data housed in one place. The expert also mentions two companies, Castor EDC and Protocol First, that offer full suite solutions for data capture and integration.

**Q.** Are you a current customer of Benchling or Veeva?
**A.** We are currently assessing Veeva's clinical suite. We are also looking at ERT, Kayentis, Y Prime.

**Q.** Can you speak to the trends you see across these marketplace?
**A.** Yes, in detail.

### Tegus Client
So we're taking a look from an investment perspective at both IQVIA and Veeva, it looks to me like IQVIA is basically put out of a software platform that is very similar to what Veeva had. Veeva obviously, started with the CRM platform that's tailored towards people going out and selling pharmaceuticals and it tried to extend that into the clinical research side. It looks to me like IQVIA is doing the exact same thing and it's having pretty good fraction going in, especially on the clinical research side. I'm trying to understand, what's the difference in the software since they're both built on top of Salesforce that seem fairly similar to me for somebody who's not using them, but then why somebody would pick one over the other? We can start general and then narrow down.

### Global Head, Strategy, and Innovation, Data Operations at Novartis
Sure. I guess a couple of broader things here. First is I'm actually very bullish on both companies as an investor. I think they're both doing really well in terms of being able to sell whatever products they feel like selling. I think IQVIA is a better sales company than Veeva. I actually think Veeva being a software company as opposed to IQVIA being a combination of a sales company, data company essentially, but a sales company from IMS and then a traditional CRO.

I do give the edge to someone like Veeva of being a proper software company. The second thing I would say is, the things that at least in the clinical realm for conducting a clinical trial, that IQVIA is doing and the things that Veeva are doing are different. I absolutely agree with you that they look very similar or identical, but in terms of within the industry, there's difference use cases, there's different users, and they are just different slices and dices of a broader landscape of technology. I can dive deeper in that.

### Tegus Client
Can you double-click on that a little bit?

### Global Head, Strategy, and Innovation, Data Operations at Novartis
Sure, absolutely. So IQVIA is first off, more of a data asset company. Actually, first off, they're a service provider. Let me not pull back the curtains here. They have a lot of data assets, but the core, even though the IMS portion is worn out in terms of executive leadership team and the culture of the company, they really are at their core, a service company. No different from ICON or Parexel or PRA, PPD, Cobent, those companies. In terms of software, and I've seen this from the customer end, I've seen this from a former end, it's very much cobbled together tech stack. Some acquisitions, some internal bills, but basically just very cobbled together.

Not to say they can't sell it, but it's very cobbled together. I think the biggest strength they have is their ability to talk about their data assets and talk about how many records they have or how many rows and columns essentially it all adds up to. Much more beneficial on the commercial side of things, less beneficial on the clinical development side of things, because we still run into issues that we have always had in terms of like recruiting patients and finding the right investor sites and things like that. The thing that I'm probably, in terms of a tech piece most impressed with IQVIA is their patient, whatever they're calling it, but it's a patient-centric portal is equivalent to an eCOA, that is clinical outcomes assessments.

It's a specific type of data that's collected in a trial, it's becoming more and more important in the last 5-7 years and it's going to be even more important going forward. Some competitors are ERT, Signant Health, Medvantx, Cintex, it's a specific niche vertical within the company. It's still data capture, but it's a different type of data. What IQVIA does not have, and this is where I'll segue into Veeva, is they don't have an electronic data capture platform that is the fundamental foundational clinical data use case. Oracle has one that's crappy. Medidata obviously has one, its less crappy, but still crappy. But Veeva, using their EDC system, are now in competition with Oracle and Medidata. IQVIA does not have that. By far, that is the most current and largest use case for Veeva.

They have a couple ancillary things that go along or what you'd expect to go along with an EDC system. Then they're releasing a life cycle data management workbench versus oddly not the same as Oracle's naming of it, but it's now called a CDB, basically clinical database. They're saying it's going to be their platform where you can do analytics and have a proper data management area, whereas the volt EDC is the data capture piece of things as opposed to the heavy analytics. So that is the big difference, from a software perspective, between Veeva and IQVIA. IQVIA has software offerings.

But it's much more data-focused in terms of analytics and insights and information, whereas Veeva has these pure transactional systems. Then this CDB is supposed to be this data warehouse, transformations of data, certainly analytics within them, dashboards, lots of different things for getting insights out of the data. But IQVIA certainly doesn't have an EDC system. If I went to IQVIA right now and said run a trial for me, they would go and subcontract it out to Medidata or Oracle or any other company that I chose. So that's a difference there between them. I'll shut up now since that was a fair amount, and see where you'd like to go.

So based on that, it seems they're not really running into each other. Is that fair to say, in terms of their skills?

### Global Head, Strategy, and Innovation, Data Operations at Novartis
Yeah. I think they still have the lawsuit going on for several different losses. But if I said, "Who are we going to for electronic data capture?" The people that you would name, especially in large pharmaco are Oracle, Medidata, and now Veeva. Those would be now our three. We've always had two choices with Oracle and Medidata. Again, speaking for large pharmaco. When someone says, "Who are we going to go to for data assets?" IQVIA comes up.

Who are we going to go to for trial optimization? IQVIA comes up. You're not getting Veeva in that conversation. So IQVIA is more of the synthesized data as an asset type company when it comes to clinical development, and Veeva is more of the actual tech systems. There is some overlap in, if you said, what do you have for investigators sites or what do you have for patients to log into and use? There's some overlap there because Veeva does offer some use case or some modules within their platform. I think it's volt but it's trial volt. It's something to do with the trial site from operational data perspective, not a clinical data perspective. Then IQVIA with their portal.

### Tegus Client
What do you mean by that?

### Global Head, Strategy, and Innovation, Data Operations at Novartis
So in a clinical trial, if a doctor sees a patient, the information about that visit; when did it happen, and who was overseeing that visit from the sponsor perspective, and was it on time? Was it late? Was it early? That's the operational data. That's stuff that would be stored in a CTMS, which Veeva also has, a Clinical Trial Management System. The patient seeing the doctor and having a blood pressure of 120 over 80 and a pulse rate of 60, and CBC, and a chem panel, all that stuff would be stored within the EDC system as clinical data. So it's basically an operational dispersal data.

### Tegus Client
Is there a reason that that's separated?

### Global Head, Strategy, and Innovation, Data Operations at Novartis
Yeah. Because the pharma industry is all messed up and they decided to slice and dice this stuff like 20 or 30 years ago. It actually is the area that makes the most sense, if I can just spend 10 seconds on this. The people that work in the operational side of things, they're not scientists, they're not clinicians, but they're way closer to the actual science and physician and clinical world than the people on the clinical data side of things who tend to be way more techie. I'm somewhere in between, even I'm on the clinical data side of things.

But basically, you have people on the clinical data side that are dealing with how to capture the data, how to process it, how to make sure it's clean, and then how to analyze it for safety and efficacy. So that's where you find your database builders, your data managers, statistical programmers, and statisticians. But the other side of things, they're clinical operations managers, they're project managers, they're very much involved with how the trial gets run, which is all the operational data. So really, those two verticals have always been pretty separate. They work together every day, but it's always been CTMS for the operational data, and an EDC system for the clinical data.

### Tegus Client
That makes sense in how the world would be split up then. Anybody who's running a clinical trial is going to be on the operational side. It's Quintiles' world before they were IQVIA and the statistical data management is much more on the tech side. So it seems, basically, what you're saying, Veeva knew how to do the tech stuff, they're running with that very well. IQVIA knew how to do the operational stuff, they're running with that very well. There's, frankly, at the end of the day, not a ton of overlap.

### Global Head, Strategy, and Innovation, Data Operations at Novartis
Yeah. Until the IMS merger, I don't believe Quintiles had really any strong technology stack to basic sell. They had stuff they used internally. Infosario was one of their big things, but basically, it was for internal use. It was so they can run trials better for their customers, but I don't believe they were actually selling it. It took IMS to come along with both the data assets and the sales mindset to really push that forward. Like I said, they do a great job of it. I saw a palpable cultural change several years back with the company. Their patient platform, which, again, I forget the name of, but were doing some piloting on it for a few studies; and It looks good. There's very crappy competition, so it's not hard to look good, but basically, that's the Ecova thing that I mentioned. Veeva does not offer that specifically in their platform yet. That would actually be the next thing that I would expect them to announce or build.

### Tegus Client
That gets to my next question does it feel to you like they're purposely, I mean, obviously you don't know the answer you're not sitting in the room where they're making decision. Do you feel they're purposely avoiding each other's territory and staying in their own lanes, or do you think they're going to start trying to get more head to head?

### Global Head, Strategy, and Innovation, Data Operations at Novartis
So it's a great question. Not like this would stop them. But if I didn't know about the lawsuits, and I haven't really looked into the feasibility of this from a financial perspective, but I would think that one of them would acquire the other or merge because there's a lot of complimentary stuff there. Taking it up one level, again, we've had such limited options in pharma. I'm going on almost 20 years in the industry and I'm not a rookie, but there's people that have been here 30, 40 years. They've always had the same options, and they suck.

So basically, anyone that is not Oracle or Medidata, there's so few companies left for us to choose from anyone that's not that has a leg up. So IQVIA is making some good headway with people that are buying from the operational data side of things, and that are used to dealing with CROs. So it's the front-end piece that I was talking about. Then a lot of people are going towards Veeva, especially with some due diligence and looking at pilots, and really saying, "Hey, you're spinning up some things now. We like it in the clinical world." We've never had that before. So really, I don't think that they're purposely avoiding spaces to compete in. I actually just think that, I don't know, based on the history of Veeva, they seem to be very judicious about rolling out-

### Tegus Client
Sticking with what they already knew.

### Global Head, Strategy, and Innovation, Data Operations at Novartis
Yeah. Actually, here's a good example. If you look at Medidata and look at their platform, they got there by internal builds and acquisitions. Glen is a brilliant guy, charming dude; the industry likes him. Terence is an awesome leader. But in terms of how they actually got the platform, that's how they got it. What it appears is that they cover so much of what you need, and it's this big platform play within the clinical sphere. What Veeva has done, and I call Veeva Medidata in orange in terms of their actual underlying technology, but it's beside the point. What Veeva has done is they've gone in different verticals; commercial, and they have a nice QMS for quality, a safety vertical, they have a rim system for regulatory, and then obviously, the clinical stuff we're talking about.

But they haven't gone all out in any one of those. In quality, they have a QMS and a few other things. In clinical, they have EDC, which is the main use case. But there's other things to be doing in there. The Ecova is territory is 30 to 35 percent of data in a trial, and they haven't gone there. Now, does their EDC system basically cover that use case? Possibly, but I doubt it. But they haven't gone there. They certainly haven't branded for it. So they're just very judicious about the way they're rolling stuff out.

What that ultimately means is, I just expect them to put out module after module that gets us close to 100 percent tech stack for most trials. They have the CTMF, they have a TMF, they have EDC. Those are big use cases. But then there's some niche things that are in there that they just don't have. If you compare side by side with Medidata, you can see these areas that are missing from Veeva's stack. But I'd rather have 70

percent that's really good or different, and 30 percent I get from someone else than 100 percent, which is what we have an option of now with Oracle, and to some extent Medidata.

### Tegus Client
It just seems like there's such a need for this stuff out there. People need to start using the tools. Are people just not aware of it? It feels to me like there's a huge market out there for them to capture if there's an actual decent tool.

### Global Head, Strategy, and Innovation, Data Operations at Novartis
Yeah. No, Absolutely. Key in a lock. So if they have the key the lock is still this big stubborn, I'm not an ageist, but there's a lot of people that have been in the industry a very long time that are resistant to change. Even if they say they're open to change, the actions ultimately speak louder than words. We do see change management being the number one barrier. It's not the lack of some good tech companies out there because there's actually a lot of pretty good small ones. It's the inevitable you want to change. Then you say, we got a good lock and key combination. Everything fits. Then you start doing the due diligence, you start doing the tech assessment, and the people that are making the decisions are deciding on stuff from 1990s thinking.

I see it daily and seeing it as recent as 30 minutes ago. So does the tech exist? Of course, it exists. It's existed for a while. But can we buy it and say that we have this good feeling in our stomach that we're not going to run into more issues, especially relative to data security and data segregation and stuff like that? If you allow me the indulgence, I'll give you a very quick example. The most current thing that I am seeing is a hesitancy with essentially cloud computing.

It doesn't mean that it's not being used. It means that there's so many caveats to using SaaS offerings that are in the public cloud or that are multi-tenant. Unless a company says we have something that we can put in a private cloud and here are all the controls you need plus more, there's always push back. That is so different than your everyday life. Of course your data is out there. Of course, you don't not use Amazon because you need to look into the AWS structure and see how your data is hosted. It's ridiculous and ludicrous to operate life like that. But that is what happens every day in the pharma industry.

### Tegus Client
Do you think that's just a misunderstanding of concern over privacy?

### Global Head, Strategy, and Innovation, Data Operations at Novartis
It's this unbelievably pedantic, just obsession over how safe your data are. It's ridiculous, actually. It's not to say that stuff can't be used, it just means it takes that much longer to get it approved, funded, and then actually scaled up. If I wanted to use Veeva today and I said, I have 100 million hours for a rollout of EDC. Here's the money. Let's do it and I picked one thing that's going to get in my way from it going live in two years, 18 months, versus two months, three months, it would be the fear that the tech stack is not GCP compliant or it's not validated, or it doesn't meet every single control that we've had in place for the past 20 or 30 years. It's just ridiculous. People would have a problem that it's not an on-premise big server farm kind of thing. Especially in large pharma you need to satisfy hundreds of people that are need to get this off the

### Tegus Client
I think people are extra sensitive over health data. They're just really worried about getting sued, it seems. Which being from the outside, I guess I can understand it but at the same time I don't. Do you know the CRM side as well or it may just be the exact same thing.

### Global Head, Strategy, and Innovation, Data Operations at Novartis
I don't, unfortunately.

### Tegus Client
No, that's fine. I really wanted to get in on the clinical side because it seems to be, at least from the outside,

you look at both of them and you're like, we have this platform and it connects the doctor to the site, to the patient, to the trial manager. The way you're describing it is they're connecting them but they're connecting very different sets of data that need to be doing very different things.

### Global Head, Strategy, and Innovation, Data Operations at Novartis
Yeah. Without going into any what they do or the slicing and dicing of the use cases, Medidata did really well obviously because they have a charismatic leader. But it was someone that was building a company that was great at selling. They put a nice shiny look on everything and the key thing here was they weren't Oracle and it took the industry probably a decade to realize the operational reality of deploying Rave and other modules on Medidata's platform.

It took about a decade to be like, "That sucks. It doesn't match the sales." Then it took another decade for people to go, "All right. We really need something else." Right now that need is Veeva. So I think unless Veeva really, really screws up, I think Veeva will have tremendous success over the next decade even if it turns out to be kind of another Medidata story where a decade from now we go, it's really not that different. I don't think it's different, but it doesn't mean that they're not going to do well. I see it happening currently.

### Tegus Client
But if people think it's different, they'll buy it.

### Global Head, Strategy, and Innovation, Data Operations at Novartis
Yeah, absolutely. By the way, I think Salesforce, I'm starting to see some branding from them relative to the clinical ecosystem. I think Salesforce could make a more direct jump into clinical trials. They've dipped their toe. They have some branding around clinical trial execution, but I think they'll get more heavily involved. So I think Salesforce and Veeva will both take

### Tegus Client
Do you think they'll head off directly against Veeva?

### Global Head, Strategy, and Innovation, Data Operations at Novartis
It's a damn good question. I could see them butting up from a transactional system point of view against Veeva. I could also see them butting up against IQVIA from sort pure analytics, or tackling very large use cases. Our biggest problem in clinical trials is finding patients, essentially. Patient recruitment is always delayed. It's the thing that costs us multi-millions of dollars in a trial in terms of delays for that trial itself. Then costs us tens to hundreds of millions, and sometimes more, in market delay in terms of time to market. So I think they could make a play for either transactional system and selling the systems or actually getting some sort of aggregation of data and selling the synthesized information. If you needed a phase three rheumatoid arthritis study running in five countries with 20 investigators, where should we go? Tell us Salesforce. How they do that I'm not sure, but I could see them getting into that.

### Tegus Client
I think it says that they something like that, but it's basically the internal system that they've been using. They know where to find all the people and they can get the study ramped up faster and all that. Is that just a line of BS?

### Global Head, Strategy, and Innovation, Data Operations at Novartis
Yeah. The IQVIA core, so it's somewhere in between BS and something that's real. It's something that's real in that if you said, give us a bunch of spreadsheets with data on it, they could do that. But if you said what is the input to that, it would be just a lot of spreadsheets with data on it from previous trials. They have a lot of customers, and they have a lot of history of clinical trial data, similar to any company that stores data. Medidata has a spinoff of Acorn AI that is essentially synthesizing the last 20 years of Rave data that customers within their contracts have given permission to Medidata to use and process. That's what IQVIA essentially is doing. They certainly have real-world data and stuff like that, but less use in ClinOps and commercial.

### Tegus Client
It seems like it would be not that hard to, if they have all that data, set up some Python code, build a front-end, and suddenly you have an engine.

### Global Head, Strategy, and Innovation, Data Operations at Novartis
That's kind of what they're doing. Except the company is not at their core a technology company.

### Tegus Client
A tech company?

### Global Head, Strategy, and Innovation, Data Operations at Novartis
Yeah.

### Tegus Client
That's fair. So if you were setting up a clinical trial today, can we just talk about where you would use Veeva and where you would use IQVIA? What the use cases are there. You touched on it a little bit but just get a little bit in the weeds.

### Global Head, Strategy, and Innovation, Data Operations at Novartis
Sure. I'll keep aside my opinion of them and just where would they be used. So IQVIA would be used from a service provision perspective. So clinical project management, site management, patient recruitment, clinical monitoring. Those activities are "front-end activities". It's very much related to getting a study started up and sites activated and started up, doing contracting with the sites, negotiating budgets with the sites, submitting lots and lots of documentation to ethics committees and institutional review boards, lots of that country specific things, lot of stuff related to the trial operations. The back-end perspective also services data management, statistical programming, statistical analysis, some pharmacovigilance and safety, which is not clinical development, but it's still a service that's tangentially related.

Those services you would procure from IQVIA. That's the classic CRO stuff. From a pure software perspective, it would be that patient portal. I'm one of the sponsors of this pilot, I really should know the specific stuff. But the patient portal, the eCOA solution that they put out, I think it was last June or July, that would be something that we would use to collect clinical data, specifically from a patient, and specifically that eCOA data. You might also hear the phrase ePRO. PRO is a type of COA. So that's where we would use them from a tech perspective, we can use them for a TMF. They have a TMF, they purchased a small company called Wingspan, that's their TMF.

That's essentially where we would use them. We could also use them if we said, "Look, we're tired of using the same sites we've used. We know the results we'll get." So long as we have enough time to actually contract with the sites, tell us the sites that we should contract with, for this study, and they will do their stuff, whether it's fancy, NASA, flat panels all over the wall or just a bunch of spreadsheets and Post-it notes. They will conjure up some magic and give to the sponsor the sites to contact, the enrollment rates that they predict, that stuff. So that synthesized information is certainly valuable at a minimum, for helping us write the protocol, helping us find the patients, helping us find the sites that find the patients.

So that's where we would use something in between a service and a tech, the data as an asset world. If we shift to VIVA, we would not use for that third piece. So let's just get that out of the way. VIVA we would not use for the first piece, which is the service piece. Let's get that out of the way. We would use them for the second piece, which is the transactional systems for operational data capture, which is their CTMS, the clinical data capture, which is their EDC system in medical coding.

Then soon, sometime this year, their data warehouse, we could use them for site payments, site and study start-up, the trial master file, the TMF, that's what we could do with VIVA. The caveat of not having services from them is we would procure services relative to the products. So we would need people that knew how to build databases in VIVA's clinical.

### Tegus Client
People who can do the install integrations, all that stuff.

### Global Head, Strategy, and Innovation, Data Operations at Novartis
Exactly. But we would not hire data managers from VIVA. We would hire them from IQVIA. So that's where there's key areas. So as we start to look at it this way, there's actually not a tremendous amount of overlap from the offering perspective. Certainly a lot of overlap in terms of, if one's going to recruit other persons, salespeople and executives and bring over intellectual property and stuff like that. There's a huge amount of overlap there, but not really from a customer perspective.

### Tegus Client
So you left your opinion out, can you put them in now?

### Global Head, Strategy, and Innovation, Data Operations at Novartis
Sure. I think service provision from IQVIA, I was actually a fan of Quintiles. I think service provision from IQVIA has gone down. There is too much selling, basically, it's a lot of people that are just not comfortable with selling and they're top-down because there's this pressure to sell.

### Tegus Client
They are forced into it.

### Global Head, Strategy, and Innovation, Data Operations at Novartis
Yeah. So I'm not big on that. However, again, investor me is different than customer me. I think they have enough people.

### Tegus Client
Shouldn't be an investor if you're going to stop spending money.

### Global Head, Strategy, and Innovation, Data Operations at Novartis
Well I am. But there's a lot of people around me that also buy stuff, and frankly, when you look at the competition in the CRO world, it's musical chairs. So it's really who have you had the most recent problem with? They get to stand up and then they wait for the new game to begin. It's round and round we go. So when you look at people like ICON, and Covance and PPD and PRA, everyone starts to look the same. The differentiators are the relationship that you might have with them. If there is a new head of development operations or a new head of drug development.

You'll see operating model changes, and then that has a knock-on effect of who gets used. There's a lot of personal favorites as at Pfizer, leadership was brought in from ICON and Parexel, and lo-and-behold, 20-something vendors went down to two main vendors. You can guess who those two main vendors were. It was ICON and Parexel. Needed an answer, I don't think he did, but that's the way it works. So when I see someone like IQVIA, have we had problems with them recently? No, we haven't.

So they'll tend to get more of a chance than say, ICON or Parexel or Covance. On the tech side of things, it's simple. If you're not Oracle or Medidata. You're getting both that for EDC and if there's some eCOA capacity, if you can actually deploy, it's EDC plus eCOA all in one. That's a surprise. Then you start to look at them as opposed to Signant Health and ERT and the pure eCOA vendors. Because it's nice to house all the data or most of the data in one place, and stop going out to a million vendors that have not done well for you. I am a best-of-breed person, but not when everyone is terrible at what they do.

### Tegus Client
I'm going to come back to that, in a second. Rewinding just a minute, on that service side you're saying, "Well it's who have we had problems with lately?" Do you find it is based on the individual project leader, if that project leader were to go from PRA to PPD, you might just stick with that person as opposed to caring about the name on the business card or do you think the company really matters?

### Global Head, Strategy, and Innovation, Data Operations at Novartis
I've spent time in large pharma, I've spent time in large CROs like IQVIA, and then spent time helping run a small CRO. The large pharma thing is, you have this operating model and you basically are just going to choose based on that framework. When I was at Pfizer and similar to Novartis, it was minimizing the amount of providers we're using. So you're really stuck with choosing from like four or five companies. You don't have many choices, so if John Doe is at company A and goes to company B, and they're like "Oh, John was awesome." That's one person on a few studies out of having to choose for a portfolio of 500.

So really you're just buying with who has basically pissed you off the least or most in the past basically, combined with, of course, the perception of, "Oh, there's some new products, new services, new offerings, and the costs obviously." So that's basically the way that works for large pharma. When I was on the small CRO side. We had a lot of small and mid-sized companies, and that's where it would matter. Absolutely would matter, where you had a few compounds and five or six studies. You're going to choose a big name to feel safe, but you're going to choose, "Oh Bob is over at PRA now. Oh my god, if Bob can run these studies or be the point person, we will choose them." That happens a lot. But the totality of studies that are run by large pharma is pretty big, compared to the hundreds and thousands of other mid-size, small and virtual companies.

### Tegus Client
That makes sense. Based on what you've said about what IQVIA has and what they're doing, it feels like there's not much actual functionality to it. The old IMS was just selling you data, and it seems like they've just repackaged it. Is that fair? Or I'm just misunderstanding, and that there is more technology that actually makes the data useful?

### Global Head, Strategy, and Innovation, Data Operations at Novartis
So from the clinical side, I've seen multiple offerings from them. One offering, I thought it was in 1995, I was incredibly disappointed with it, it was even worse than I could even have imagined. Then in seeing their patient portal and their eCOA patient-centric solution. It was actually pretty slick. It was good, I was very impressed with it. Again, not much to compare to, because again, other companies are crappy with their interfaces, but it was good. Then I've seen middle, like it's going to take a while to understand this stuff, but once you do, works pretty decent. People that are behind the product, they know what they're doing. So you had this middle of the road thing. So it runs the gamut. But I think the glue that keeps that all together, is there's a lot of brute force behind it. I don't think it's this really well-oiled SDLC machines thing going on. I think it's just a lot of

### Tegus Client
What do you mean by that?

### Global Head, Strategy, and Innovation, Data Operations at Novartis
Like a software development life cycle. I don't think they have well mapped out, at their core, their software company.

### Tegus Client
They need some product managers, is what you are saying.

### Global Head, Strategy, and Innovation, Data Operations at Novartis
Yes, in large pharma, a lot of times people, especially on the IT side, they want to develop products. They don't just want to buy from the external environment, and they just happened to be in pharma. They probably should be in a software company, but they're in pharma and they want to build. Then we build products that work for us, for the here-and-now, and you would never buy a product that large pharma built, in terms of a tech product, ever. That's what a CRO building a tech product is very reminiscent of.

### Tegus Client
Got you. So it's not a ringing endorsement, but it sounds like maybe their competition is crappy enough and

that the need is great enough that they'll still do pretty well with what they're doing. Is that fair?

### Global Head, Strategy, and Innovation, Data Operations at Novartis
That's right and certainly make no mistake, a lot of this stuff is not sold in isolation. So I probably wouldn't go to IQVIA for just the ECO MS, that's a bad example. I probably wouldn't go to them just for the TMF product. I would probably go to them for the TMF product plus services related to trial operations or document management. I would go to them for product plus services actually. Whereas a tech company you go to them for just the product.

### Tegus Client
So you said product plus service, but it sounds almost more like service plus product.

### Global Head, Strategy, and Innovation, Data Operations at Novartis
Sure. I guess the weighted aspect of that certainly could be on the service side, but the point is when someone says, name the clinical tech companies, IQVIA simply does not come to mind for the majority of use cases, the vast majority.

### Tegus Client
So does having a suite that can do the operational side of the business versus, you mentioned earlier doing a best of breed versus having all your data in one framework. Does that make much of a difference or do you think not really?

### Global Head, Strategy, and Innovation, Data Operations at Novartis
It does. It's like a bad dating scene when you have a lack of choices. I'm a married guy now, but I've dated over a lot of years and when there's a bad dating scene, you can make some bad choices and you're not really happy with that. The choices that we have for the CTMS side of things: Oracle, Medidata, Parexel, they at least have a proper IT arm or product development arm but still sucks. Really we start to run out right there, and there's other small CTMS and mid-size, but you start to run out of options. So CTMS, no-one's one scratching us where we itch. Then obviously we talked about the clinical data side.

This is covering a large, large portion, foundational stuff, of how we run trials and as a person that heads up in innovation vertical, it's not like I think we should throw all that away and completely do things differently. It's that this is foundational stuff for a lot of the industry. There's going to be way different ways of running trials as we go forward, but they're very heavily anchored in those different use cases. Frankly, I think a lot of our problem is not so much that we run things terribly wrong, it's that, if you had, I don't know, Wordpad instead of Microsoft Word, you probably wouldn't want to use a word processor. It's not really that good. But you have Word here you're like, "Gosh. I'm never going back to writing again." So that's what we have. We don't even have Wordpad, we have Notepad. I mean, know are my analogies. The Office analogy is a very easy one. We don't have a Microsoft Office of clinical technology. It'd be nice to have that. I think Veeva will actually get there.

### Tegus Client
I was going to ask you on that line of thought. Do you have conversations with the development team saying, this is what we're looking for, this is what we need? Or are they not really engaging back with their customer base for either company?

### Global Head, Strategy, and Innovation, Data Operations at Novartis
That doesn't happen to my knowledge with IQVIA. Let me say it this way. At scale or enterprise level that's not happening that I can tell with IQVIA. In terms of the individual pilots, it's happening, but not in terms of their main product roadmap. It is happening in an informal way with Veeva, definitely much more of a collaborative approach there. Not to say that IQVIA wouldn't do that. But Veeva just has seemingly a different approach to it.

You just mean that they're more proactive about it?

### Global Head, Strategy, and Innovation, Data Operations at Novartis
Yeah, a colleague of mine who sits on the leadership team with me is very actively engaged with that CDB product specifically and renowned hub data repository guys. So he's very heavily involved with their roadmap and stuff like that, and that's great. I mean, it's not building it for Novartis by any stretch, but it's taking what our pain points are and trying to transform that.

### Tegus Client
If Novartis wants it, there's a pretty good chance that somebody else needs it, too.

### Global Head, Strategy, and Innovation, Data Operations at Novartis
Yeah, exactly.

### Tegus Client
From their perspective, why not have that conversation?

### Global Head, Strategy, and Innovation, Data Operations at Novartis
Yeah, exactly, and it's almost like free consulting basically or you know. So I'm saying, if I've given you the key of how to sell to us, then you probably should

### Tegus Client
You want to listen.

### Global Head, Strategy, and Innovation, Data Operations at Novartis
Probably listen, yeah.

### Tegus Client
So it's super high-level easy question. How are these things bought? I mean, each company likes to announce, "Oh, we got this label." IQVIA really likes to hang their hat on they got Roche signed up and Roche used to have their whole, we do everything in-house. We don't need a vendor. So it seems like a big deal but are they just buying like single projects at a time or are you saying we have a deal and we're going to buy your suite, we're going to use it going forward? How's that buying process done?

### Global Head, Strategy, and Innovation, Data Operations at Novartis
Yeah. From a branding perspective, if I see something like, we have six out of the top 10 pharma companies are customers. All it takes is, just let me do 50 grand worth of work, 10 grand worth of work, anything so I can just say that. I see that happen with small companies and Pfizer and Novartis and stuff like that, where they just need any billable service, and they can tell their investors and the public, hey, this company has a customer. So with that being said, I think most of what you see are either individual projects, or particular programs. So maybe a half dozen or less studies or some piloting, but not these at scale partnerships.

So unless something is specifically named either as a partnership or running a full suite, I would be very hesitant to think that it is this go forward, huge scale up that's promised or guaranteed. The exception would be if someone either explicitly states that or it is one of these fundamental foundational use cases like EDC or CTMS. If I saw GSK all in on Veeva. So if I saw something from GSK or Veeva that GSK says we're using Veeva's EDC solution. I would think, because it's EDC, that it's not we're going to do one or two studies and see how it goes. There's a big contract signed for a large scale up. So I guess it depends on which use case it is. If I saw it from Veeva it would be more likely that it would be a large implementation. If I saw it from IQVIA, it would be more likely that it would be project or program-based.

### Tegus Client
Or even a trial basis, you think?

### Global Head, Strategy, and Innovation, Data Operations at Novartis
Yeah. Yes, that's right. When I say project, that's trial. Set of individuals.

### Tegus Client
They're trialing it on one project. If that project goes well, maybe it'll expand kind of thing.

### Global Head, Strategy, and Innovation, Data Operations at Novartis
Exactly, exactly.

### Tegus Client
Well, this has covered a lot of ground for me. So I appreciate it. Is there anything else that we haven't covered that you think is important for me to be thinking about?

### Global Head, Strategy, and Innovation, Data Operations at Novartis
Specifically with Veeva and IQVIA?

### Tegus Client
Yeah, or their market and the competition against them. Anything like that.

### Global Head, Strategy, and Innovation, Data Operations at Novartis
I mean there's several, I think excellent small companies. I don't know if you have any interest in smaller companies, but there's a couple smaller companies that I think could actually end up taking more than a nibble from the share of larger players like IQVIA, Veeva, Medidata, and Oracle.

### Tegus Client
Are those kind of full suite or are they just individual point solutions?

### Global Head, Strategy, and Innovation, Data Operations at Novartis
They're basically multi-solution data capture companies. They're more data capture and data, either integration or data flow, we'll say, companies.

### Tegus Client
But basically where your standpoint is they're straight up addressing it.

### Global Head, Strategy, and Innovation, Data Operations at Novartis
Yeah, and definitely in a different way. The two companies, it's Castor EDC, the disclaimer there is I'm on the supervisory board, but there's a reason why I am. They're just doing phenomenal work. Then the other company is called Protocol First, who actually has a decently mature, excellent EDC offering. But they also have a EHR to EDC kind of middle-ware application that is going to be huge, and the disclaimer there is I'm doing a lot of work with them on that.

### Tegus Client
Well, yeah. But I don't understand why that doesn't exist already, to be honest.

### Global Head, Strategy, and Innovation, Data Operations at Novartis
Here's the hint on that one is, the way that we capture data in terms of relational databases within our world and clinical data is very different from the way an EHR is set up with longitudinal data records, and being able to get that square peg in a round hole has just been really tough. The people that have been trying to solve it know nothing about EHR layout. I'm not saying I do, but I'm smart enough not to say I know I do, and then make a crappy product, and that's what's happening.

But it seems that with so much value locked up in EHR's. There's just so much value there that somebody has to unlock it, and you just take it.

### Global Head, Strategy, and Innovation, Data Operations at Novartis
Yeah, absolutely.

### Tegus Client
Make it unrelational and then re-relate it.

### Global Head, Strategy, and Innovation, Data Operations at Novartis
Just simply from the standpoint of there's a lot of data there, so let's mine it. So someone like TriNetX is good at doing that in terms of the analytics piece of it. I just entered 120 radian Epic, why do I got to enter 120 radian Rave for this Novartis study, and that's specifically one of the products that Protocol First offers that's specifically dealing with that pain point in a very, very unique way, and to my knowledge, the only company that's actually doing that. It doesn't cover 100 percent of the data, but maybe 60, 70 percent. So any tool that we can give to the sites to stop doing this administrative bullshit work and get them with patients and dealing with more important stuff is a victory for us.

### Tegus Client
It seems that you actually make it easier for the sites as well. I mean, what's it like 10 percent of sites are going to redo one because it's such a pain?

### Global Head, Strategy, and Innovation, Data Operations at Novartis
Yeah, that's the main use case of that particular tool is to say to a site, when you're done entering the data for the patient that came in for this Novartis study, you can-

### Tegus Client
You're done, launch.

### Global Head, Strategy, and Innovation, Data Operations at Novartis
You can launch Firefox or Chrome or Azure or whatever, login to Clinical Pipe, it'll select the data and it will auto-map it to Rave, then click of a button it will insert those data into Rave. Again, it's not 100 percent of the trial data, but it's what's in your EHR and it's most of that data. It could save you a half a day or a day of work and that's a lot of time.

### Tegus Client
Then running a trial, that doc is a lot more likely to work with you.

### Global Head, Strategy, and Innovation, Data Operations at Novartis
Exactly. One of the things is it actually cuts down on clinical monitoring time, which for Novartis is great because they're internal. But for a CRO, monitoring is 30 to 35 percent of a study budget. So to someone like IQVIA, or Parexel or ICON, really want that product out there. So there's headwinds with some of this stuff in terms of the industry, and there's also a very good reason why the stuff doesn't exist is it can cannibalize some revenue for sure, from a CRM perspective. Inefficiencies is where CRO's were made. That is basically it.

### Tegus Client
The thing that a CRO would want to own themselves and not let the other CRO's have so that they can actually underbid on every CRO project and win every one needs to go buy today.

### Global Head, Strategy, and Innovation, Data Operations at Novartis
You're absolutely right. I have no doubt that Protocol First has entertained many offers, but their valuation

right now is probably, I don't know, five to ten x, too small just for what it should be sold at. That's all I'll say about that. It's just there's so much potential for it that I think it would just be too early to sell.

### Tegus Client
Yeah. Fair enough. So I appreciate your time. Yeah, that's all. Take care.
