Bank details must be provided and verified for each covered entity listed under your Beacon account. Data submission and rebate payment processing will not be fully live in Beacon until January 1st, 2026. To avoid any interruptions to 340B rebate payments, covered entities should ensure **Beacon Disc Pymt** is established as a trusted trade partner in their ERP system.

## Account Management

Once logged in, account administrators can manage their own Beacon account as well as their entity's Beacon profile. Administrators may invite team members from the Entities tab or register additional entities. Administrators can access multiple Beacon profiles when logged in.

### How to Invite New Users

1.  Log in to your Beacon account.
2.  Click the **Entities** tab from the top menu bar.
3.  Click **Invite New User**.
4.  Complete the user's information and select their role.

### Administrator vs. User Permissions

Unlike administrators, users are unable to register additional entities, invite new team members, or provide bank details. Both users and administrators will be able to submit data and reconcile rebates once the full functionality is released.

### How to Register Additional Entities

Only account administrators can register entities and must have the required documentation available to complete the registration. Consistent with the initial registration, all submitted documentation will be reviewed by Beacon Support. Documentation processing may take up to 5 business days.

## Column Mapping

Beacon will begin accepting the submission of claims and purchase data on January 1st, 2026. In advance of that date, users can set up their column mappings for purchases, pharmacy claims and medical claims data submissions in Beacon and preview data submissions to identify potential formatting and validation errors. This will help ensure successful data submissions beginning January 1st, 2026.

When submitting data, users must map the fields of their raw data file to the fields required by Beacon. This is referred to as column mapping. To save time on data submissions, Beacon enables users to establish column mapping templates. Templates enable users to define a set of column mappings for a particular file and then utilize that mapping whenever a user attaches and submits a file with the same fields. Users can set multiple column mapping templates for use across multiple file types.

### How to Establish a Column Mapping Template

1.  Log in to your Beacon account.

## Purchase Submissions

When 340B covered entities purchase drugs through their accounts, they create purchase data that is available through the wholesaler. This purchase data is generated for each instance of a pharmaceutical product purchased at a commercial price such as WAC. Users will submit purchase data to Beacon to support that the product was purchased by the covered entity. Only purchase data for those covered entities that a user is registered under will be accepted.

Prior to January 1st, 2026, Beacon is not accepting the submission of any claims or purchase data. In the interim, users can get familiar with the functionality surrounding purchase data submissions such as column mapping and reviewing flagged errors.

### Purchase Data Requirements

The following fields are required when submitting purchase data to Beacon. To help streamline data processes, templates are available for download from the Resource Center.

## Medical Claims Submissions

Users will submit 340B claims data for separately payable drug administrations and outpatient drug administrations. Separately payable drug administrations are products that have been physician administered to a patient and are reimbursed at the procedure code level for the specific administered drug. Outpatient drug administrations generally include drugs that are used as part of an outpatient procedure. These are included at a bundled rate (i.e. APG or negotiated case rate with a payer) and are not separately payable.

## Upcoming Functionality

### Purchase Validations

When Beacon begins accepting the submission of claims data and purchase data, users will be able to view any errors that were flagged as part of Beacon's validations. Users will also have insight into their purchase submission history. Errors flagged post-submission will not be visible until Beacon begins accepting the submission of claims data and purchase data. These post-submission errors operate separately from errors that are flagged prior to submission.

The below outlines some of the purchase data criteria utilized by Beacon when purchase data is submitted.

*   ◆ Data of purchase: purchase must have occurred after the date on which the manufacturer adopts the Rebate model.
*   ◆ Purchase price: the purchase must be made on a covered entity's account at the commercial price.
*   ◆ NDC-11: the purchased NDC must be in scope of the manufacturer's Rebate model policy.
*   ◆ Ship-To NPI: the physical inventory must be shipped to a location that is eligible based upon HRSA registration status and manufacturer policy.
*   ◆ Invoice Number: purchase must be made on an account owned by the covered entity.

Users will be able to view the status of their submission as well as any flagged error codes from the **Purchases** Tab (1) through the **Purchase Report** (2) in the **Issues** table (3). Purchase data that does not meet all criteria will fail the validation. Eligible 340B claims data will be automatically accumulated against purchase submissions that are successfully validated by the platform.

## 340B Claim Validations

When Beacon begins accepting the submission of claims data and purchase data, users will be able to view any errors that were flagged as part of Beacon's validations. Users will submit all types of 340B drug utilization to the Beacon platform to receive Rebate payments on the original purchase. This includes 340B claims for retail dispenses at both contract pharmacy locations and those pharmacies operated by the covered entity, separately payable drug administrations, and outpatient drug administrations. Errors flagged post-submission will not be visible until Beacon begins accepting the submission of claims data and purchase data. These post-submission errors operate separately from errors that are flagged prior to submission.

A set of validations are performed to ensure the 340B eligibility of each individual claim line submitted to Beacon. The below outlines some of the 340B claims data eligibility criteria utilized by Beacon when 340B claims data is submitted.

beaconchannelmanagement.com

---

## Beacon.
Channel Management

*   ◆ Claim has not already been submitted by a different 340B covered entity.
*   ◆ 340B claim was submitted within a specific time-period.
*   ◆ Dispense or administration of any individual claim must have occurred after the purchase date of the priced invoice or up to seven days prior to the dispense.
*   ◆ Dispensing pharmacy or administering facility is registered on the HRSA database as a 340B covered entity parent or child site, a registered shipping address of a covered entity's parent or child site, or a contract pharmacy.
*   ◆ Dispensing pharmacy is eligible under a manufacturer's contract pharmacy policy.
*   ◆ Product listed on the 340B claim is incorporated into a manufacturer's 340B Rebate model policy.
*   ◆ Total units of the drug included on the claim line falls within an acceptable range.

Users can view the status of their submission as well as any flagged error codes from the **Claims** Tab (1) through the **Claims Report** (2) in the **Issues** table (3). 340B claims data that does not meet all criteria will fail the validation. 340B claims submissions that are successfully validated by the platform will be automatically accumulated against eligible purchase data.

## Rebate Accumulations

When Beacon begins accepting the submission of claims and purchase data, users will be able to view the status of their rebate accumulations. Rebates are accumulated as eligible purchase data and corresponding 340B-eligible claims data are submitted to Beacon. The purchase report data will provide insights into the status of claims accumulated against the purchase. The claims report data will provide insight into which packages the claims have been allocated to.

## Rebate Payments

Following the submission of eligible purchase data, 340B rebates will be paid upon the submission of eligible 340B claims submission. Users will have insight into the status of these rebates while the request is processing. Beacon will highlight both the rebate ID and the transaction ID once the payment is processed and paid. Both IDs will also be made available on the covered entity's bank account statement to link between Beacon rebate payments and actual bank deposits. Beacon will make available a downloadable report that will include status details across claims, packages, rebates and allocations.

## Next Steps

Beacon registration is open and DSH entities are encouraged to register to ensure they have adequate time to prepare for January 1st, 2026. The below outlines how administrators can ensure their covered entities are ready.

1.  **Complete your Beacon registration.**
    Navigate to cm.beaconchannelmanagement.com to register your covered entity. Explore the Support Center to familiarize yourself with Beacon functionality. Connect with Beacon Support if you have any questions or require assistance.
2.  **Engage with your TPA.**
    Engage with your TPAs in advance of the January 1st, 2026 launch. Data templates are available for download from the Support Center to help streamline data submission processes and Beacon is actively engaging with TPAs on Beacon functionality and installation of software developer kits (SDKs) to support direct data submissions. Covered entities should encourage their TPAs to access the Support Calendar on Beacon for details on attending future trainings or reach out to support@beaconchannelmanagement.com for more information.
3.  **Set up your bank account information to ensure ability to receive rebate payments.**
    After Beacon registration is completed, authorized administrators will be prompted to submit their covered entity's bank details in Beacon. This verification is completed after account registration and occurs once logged in to your Beacon account. Authorized administrators should be prepared to provide their covered entity's account number, routing number, and a certified bank letter from their financial institution. When Beacon begins accepting data submissions on January 1st, 2026, covered entities will only have access to 340B rebate payments once a bank account has been submitted and verified.
4.  **Establish column mappings for pharmacy claims, medical claims, and purchase data.**

From your Beacon account, users can establish column mapping templates for their data submissions. Users will be able to attach data to become familiar with some of the Beacon validations. Beginning January 1st, 2026 users will be able to attach and submit their data submissions to accumulate rebate payments. Establishing column mapping templates in advance of January 1st, 2026 will streamline your data upload times. If you require assistance, access resources from the Support Center or reach out to Beacon Support.

5.  **Prepare for data submissions on January 1st, 2026.**
    When Beacon begins accepting data submissions on January 1st, 2026, covered entities should be prepared to submit 340B eligible dispense data and purchase data to the Beacon platform. Leading up to this date, Beacon Support encourages covered entities to attend the Beacon Support sessions available for sign up in the Support Calendar, review the written and recorded resource content in the Support Center, and reach out to Beacon Support by phone, chat, or email with questions.

Thank you.
