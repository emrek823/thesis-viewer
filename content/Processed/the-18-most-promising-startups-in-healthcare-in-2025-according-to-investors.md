We asked top investors at firms like A16z and NEA to name healthcare's most promising startups.

Most of their picks are using AI, automating in critical areas like healthcare hiring and payments.

Meet the 18 healthcare startups investors have been watching in 2025.

Healthcare investors are chomping at the bit to fund hot startups tackling administrative burdens, workforce shortages, and high medical costs with new technologies.

We asked 10 investors from VC firms, private equity shops, and family offices to identify the most promising healthcare startups of 2025.

Top backers from firms like Kleiner Perkins, Andreessen Horowitz, and Oak HC/FT were asked to make two picks each: one healthcare startup from their portfolio, and one they have no financial interest in.

Nearly every startup nominated is utilizing AI in their products, from automating hospital back-end tasks to assisting patients with questions about their payments. Healthcare AI startups have dominated digital health VC funding so far this year, capturing nearly $4 billion of the $6.4 billion raised across the industry in the first half of 2025, according to Rock Health.

Here's the full list of the most promising healthcare startups of 2025, according to investors.

Akasa

Malinka Walaliyadde, CEO and cofounder of Akasa. AKASA

Nominated by: Julie Yoo, Andreessen Horowitz (an investor)

Total funding: $205 million, according to the company

What it does: Akasa aims to automate hospital revenue cycle management using AI.

Why it's promising: Healthcare RCM has been a red-hot market for VC and private equity investment this year. Akasa sells its tech to top hospitals, including Cleveland Clinic, Duke, and Johns Hopkins; Yoo said Akasa has won these customers because the company solves problems other healthcare RCM companies haven't cracked, using AI to interpret medical records for more accurate insurance reimbursement.

A16z led Akasa's seed and Series A rounds. The startup last raised $120 million in Series C funding in 2022, led by Coatue Management.

Cadence

Chris Altchek, founder and CEO of Cadence. Cadence

Nominated by: Austin Walters, SpringTide Ventures (not an investor)

Total funding: $141 million, according to the company

What it does: Cadence helps patients manage chronic conditions with remote monitoring tech and telehealth.

Why it's promising: Cadence now serves over 70,000 patients across 20 health systems, including Hackensack Meridian and Providence. The company told Business Insider that it has seen 100% year-over-year revenue growth in 2025 and is on track to surpass $100 million in annual recurring revenue by 2026.

"They have done a great job of successfully selling into health systems to aid with remote patient care and monitoring of the elderly," Walters said. "While they raised a lot of money in the ZIRP days, they have managed cash well since then, and are a solid player in the landscape."

Carefam

Matan Hoffmann, cofounder and CEO of Carefam. Carefam

Nominated by: Allison Baum Gates, SemperVirens (an investor)

Total funding: $14 million, according to the company

What it does: Carefam offers an AI-powered hiring platform that connects nurses and other clinicians with open roles, while assisting them with related tasks such as resume review and interview preparation.

Why it's promising: Healthcare faces an ever-worsening workforce shortage, Gates noted. Carefam creates a "best of both worlds" scenario for AI's role in healthcare, she said — using AI to more quickly match people to the right clinical roles that AI can't replace.

The company said it's live across hundreds of healthcare facilities, with more than 30,000 clinicians active on the platform.

Chai Discovery

Chai Discovery cofounders Joshua Meier, CEO, and Jack Dent, President. The startup has two other cofounders, not pictured, Matthew McPartlon and Jacques Boitreaud. Chai Discovery

Nominated by: Vig Chandramouli, Oak HC/FT (no financial relationship)

Total funding: $100 million, according to the company

What it does: Chai builds AI models that predict molecular structures and design new antibodies to accelerate drug development.

Why it's promising: Chai has been off to the races since its 2024 founding. The startup raised a $70 million Series A round in August, led by Menlo Ventures. Thrive Capital, OpenAI, and Dimension led its $30 million seed round the year prior.

"They've shown quickly and effectively how they can solve problems that previously took many years and millions of dollars," he said.

Clasp

Tess Michaels, founder and CEO of Clasp. Clasp

Nominated by: Irem Rami, Norwest (no financial relationship)

Total funding: $50.4 million

What it does: Clasp connects health systems with aspiring clinicians, often while they're still in training, to provide student loan repayment programs tied to post-graduation employment.

Why it's promising: Clasp wants to tackle healthcare's workforce shortage and the student debt crisis at the same time with programs that the company likens to ROTC, but for medicine instead of the military.

Clasp said it's reached $100 million in student loan commitments across top healthcare systems, including Boston Children's Hospital and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. The company was also named to Business Insider's 2025 list of startups to bet your career on in February.

"By better connecting students with opportunities, Clasp is helping providers build sustainable workforces in a highly competitive environment," Rami said.

Courier Health

Danny Sigurdson, founder and CEO of Courier Health. Courier Health

Nominated by: Irem Rami, Norwest (an investor)

Total funding: $24 million, according to the company

What it does: Courier Health sells a customer relationship management platform to biopharma companies to help them coordinate and support patients, especially those on specialty drugs.

Why it's promising: Courier Health links fragmented patient and provider data to help drugmakers understand patient journeys and improve medication access and adherence. In 2025, the company said it quadrupled its client base and more than doubled its headcount.

"Courier Health is transforming the way pharma engages with patients by providing visibility across the entire patient journey. Their platform ensures the right patients are connected with the right therapies at the right time, ultimately improving access, adherence, and outcomes," Rami said.

Diana Health

Diana Health CEO and cofounder Kate Condliffe. Diana Health

Nominated by: Blake Wu, NEA (an investor)

Total funding: $101 million, according to the company.

What it does: Diana Health offers women's healthcare across gynecology, maternity, menopause, and wellness, with virtual and in-person services.

Why it's promising: Diana partners with hospitals to design and operate women's care programs, pairing nurse-midwives with specialists like OB-GYNs and mental health clinicians for care in the hospitals or at outpatient clinics. The startup raised $55 million in Series C funding in September, led by HealthQuest Capital, to keep expanding its footprint. Diana Health now works with nine hospitals in Tennessee, Florida, and Texas.

Wu noted that women's health, especially maternity care, has historically been a challenging area for startups. He said Diana's model yields better health outcomes for patients while controlling costs.

"We've evaluated dozens of startups in the space, and our view is that Diana's clinical model is unique and highly differentiated," he said.

Inbox Health

Blake Walker, cofounder and CEO of Inbox Health. Inbox Health

Nominated by: Steve Piaker and Kyle Kruse, Ten Coves (an investor)

Total funding: $55 million, according to the company

What it does: Inbox Health automates patient billings for healthcare practices, with AI-powered support tools to help those patients understand their payments.

Why it's promising:

Inbox's AI-powered tools aim to simplify and speed up payments for providers. The company said it's now working with over 3,500 healthcare practices and over 2.8 million patients a year.

Ten Coves led a $20 million growth equity funding round for Inbox Health in October.

"It is our belief that as high-deductible health insurance plans continue to proliferate, Inbox Health's suite of AI-powered patient engagement and payment solutions are well-positioned to scale and address the need for improved patient collections and greater back-office efficiency, a multi-billion-dollar industry pain point," Piaker and Kruse said in an email to Business Insider.

Infinitus

Ankit Jain, cofounder and CEO of Infinitus. Infinitus Systems

Nominated by: Ilya Fushman, Kleiner Perkins (an investor)

Total funding: $102.9 million, according to the company

What it does: Infinitus builds AI agents to handle administrative tasks, especially phone calls, in healthcare across pharma companies, health plans, and provider organizations.

Why it's promising: Fushman said Infinitus has had a breakout year as it works to automate time-consuming tasks for healthcare organizations, such as benefits verification, prior authorizations, and prescription follow-ups. This month, the startup rolled out new tech for pharma companies selling directly to patients, including providing around-the-clock answers to patient questions about their medications.

Fushman led Infinitus's seed and Series A rounds. He said Infinitus already supports 44% of the Fortune 50, two of the five national payers, and eight of the 10 biggest life sciences companies, and pointed to its partnership with Salesforce, which offers Infinitus's voice AI agents to customers of Salesforce's life sciences cloud platform. "Their enterprise partnership momentum continues to accelerate," Fushman said.

Knownwell

Brooke Boyarsky Pratt, founder and CEO of Knownwell. Knownwell

Nominated by: Jannick Dam Mortensen, Maj Invest (no financial relationship)

Total funding: $50 million, according to the company

What it does: Knownwell provides integrated obesity care, including primary care and weight management, in person and virtually.

Why it's promising: As demand for obesity care skyrockets, Knownwell has expanded to 10 brick-and-mortar clinics across the US. The startup announced a fresh $25 million in funding in October, led by CVS Health Ventures and including Andreessen Horowitz, a previous investor, to power its continued growth.

Knownwell also notched a deal in April to offer its weight care services through Eli Lilly's direct-to-consumer digital health platform, LillyDirect.

Mortensen said the company provides a care experience for patients that's "highly individualized and comprehensive."

Nudge

Nominated by: Ilya Fushman, Kleiner Perkins (no financial relationship)

Total funding: $100 million, according to PitchBook

What it does: Nudge aims to create "whole-brain interfaces," using ultrasound technology to image and stimulate the brain, to enable treatments for neurological conditions such as addiction and essential tremors.

Why it's promising: Nudge has a tall task ahead of it: creating dynamic maps of the brain by combining complex neuroscience with hardware and software. Fushman highlighted Nudge's usage of non-invasive technology for both imaging and precise brain stimulation.

The startup raised $100 million in Series A funding in July, co-led by Thrive Capital and Greenoaks, to tackle that challenge.

Nudge's CEO, Fred Ehrsam, previously cofounded Coinbase and is a general partner at crypto VC firm Paradigm. Nudge's founding team also includes a former Neuralink product VP.

PayZen

PayZen cofounder and CEO Itzik Cohen. PayZen

Nominated by: Blake Wu, NEA (no financial relationship)

Total funding: $87 million, according to the company

What it does: PayZen works with health systems and physician groups to offer no-cost payment plans to patients for out-of-pocket medical bills.

Why it's promising: Nearly half of Americans find it difficult to afford their healthcare costs, according to a KFF poll published earlier this year. Amid healthcare's affordability crisis, PayZen's approach stands out, Wu said.

The startup uses AI underwriting models to create personalized payment plans that patients are more likely to stick to, thereby increasing revenue for providers.

"Across our investment portfolio, we're looking for opportunities where we can help align incentives and improve outcomes for all healthcare stakeholders, starting with the patient," Wu said. "In our work in the category, PayZen's model emerged as the most unique that we have seen."

RapidClaims

Nominated by: Steve Piaker and Kyle Kruse, Ten Coves (no financial relationship)

Total funding: $11 million, according to PitchBook

What it does: RapidClaims sells AI-powered software to healthcare provider organizations to help them capture more revenue.

Why it's promising: RapidClaims is another startup riding the wave of VC interest into healthcare revenue cycle management. Founded in 2023, the startup sells AI tools to automate medical coding, claims management, and denials prevention, among other back-end financial tasks. The startup raised $8 million in a Series A funding round in April, led by VC firm Accel.

Piaker and Kruse said RapidClaims' tech is compelling in its potential not only to speed up cash collection for providers but to eliminate compliance concerns and manual errors in the process.

Stedi

Zack Kanter, founder and CEO of Stedi. Stedi

Nominated by: Julie Yoo, Andreessen Horowitz (no financial relationship)

Total funding: $92 million, according to the company

What it does: Stedi handles and routes transactions between healthcare pro
