## Slide 3: PROBLEM

**Private practice neurology is under pressure**
**yet there's a deep desire to remain independent**

**Declining Reimbursement**
Rates are down ~10% since 2020 and denials up to 17%

"
We equally recognize the passion you both have for the
vision of keeping neurology practices independent and
it's perfectly aligned with our strategies.
– CEO, Outpatient Neurology Practice

**Increasing Costs**
Inflation has increased ~22% over the same period

**Staffing Challenges**
Wage increases coupled with staff turnover creates pressure

I have wanted to go on my own for many years, but have
been too worried about taking the risk. I feel like under
your guidance I could make this transition.
– Neurology Nurse Practitioner

## Slide 4: WHY NOW

**There's $200Bn+ of value coming to neurology**
**and we're going to help independent neurologists unlock it**

**$110Bn**
Neurology drug spend to
double by 2030

**14mm+**
Diagnosed dementia
patients by 2050

**1 in 3**
Americans has a
neurological disorder

* Less than 10% of independent neuro practices have infusions/pharmacy
* New diagnosis tools & treatment options driving paradigm shift
* Shortage of neurologists against an aging population

4

## Slide 5: OPPORTUNITY

**In-office infusions are the biggest near-term revenue driver**
**but practices are limited by staff and legacy tech stacks**

Ancillary services can increase collections by 50%+

**Current Collections Per Doctor**
$800k

**Potential Collections**
$1.4mm
($600k increase from infusions)
* Infusions
* Research
* Imaging
* Pharmacy

But practices need partners to help to launch them

*   **X Outdated and Fragmented Technology Stacks**
    Series of point solutions and manual workflows
*   **X Limited Resources and Know-How**
    Lack of experience in launching new ancillaries

5

## Slide 6: (No Title)

We're building an AI-powered managed services organization to intelligently
automate workflows and and help neurologists launch profitable ancillaries

## Slide 7: MVP

**We're starting with**
**revenue cycle**
**management to set**
**the technology**
**foundation**

**Referral Intake**
**Benefits Verification**
**Scheduling**
**Prior Authorization**
**Documentation**
**Claims Processing**
**Denials and Appeals**

**Initial Wedges: Back Office AI Copilots**

**Referral Intake**
*   Slow referral processing times cause leakage
*   Limited prioritization of referrals and triaging
*   Rarely have full patient medical records

**Prior Authorization**
*   Incredibly manual and time intensive
*   Required to launch infusions and imaging
*   Botox PAs are unique to neurology

7

## Slide 8: VISION

**We want to create the operating system for neurology**

**Automate Operations**
+5-10% uplift in collections

**Integrate Ancillaries**
+50% uplift in revenue

**Enhance Care**
+5-20% uplift in revenue

**Autonomy Health Operating System**
*   EMR
*   AI Workers
*   Workflows
*   Intelligence

*   Create and own the system of record
*   Integrate AI agents to augment staff
*   High quality data trains intelligence layer
*   Result is a product moat with network effects

## Slide 9: STRATEGY

**Asset light approach has enabled early distribution**
**while we validated the right products to build**

| Phase 1             | Phase 2                   | Phase 3                       | Phase 4                     |
| :------------------ | :------------------------ | :---------------------------- | :-------------------------- |
| **Distribution**    | **Product**               | **Geographic Density**        | **Data and Risk**           |
| Asset-light model to start | Build neurology operating system | Aggregate density in certain geos | Create ideal care pathways  |
| Build strong distribution channels | Create a product moat     | Launch de-novo sites          | Clinical decision support   |
| Learn which products to build | Aggregate network effects | Network effects as practices adopt | Opportunistically take on risk sharing |

## Slide 11: PIPELINE

**Our current pipeline of 19 practices and 100 neurologists**
**represents a multi-million dollar revenue opportunity**

**Current Pipeline**

*   **15 Practices**
    In active discussions
*   **2 Practices**
    Under NDA/BAA
*   **2 Practices**
    Expected to sign LOIs

Separate de-novo pipeline of 18 neurologists

**Go-To-Market Strategy**

*   Initial customers acquired through warm intros and door-to-door sales (pharma rep style)
*   Most effective lead gen channels have been warm introductions and conferences
*   We expect the MSO to scale predominantly through word-of-mouth over time

Our mission is to keep
neurologists independent

When physicians have more autonomy,
they can deliver better patient care.
