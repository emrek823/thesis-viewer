1.0 PURPOSE AND BACKGROUND

PURPOSE

The Plan is seeking a Vendor to provide data aggregation services for population health analysis and management. The Plan requires a Vendor that brings best in class population health analysis expertise of demographic, medical, pharmacy, and provider data to provide insights about the Plan's approximately 572,000 self-funded members. Vendor must be capable of using modern data analysis methods and tools to provide summary and detail level reporting and/or graphical representations that can be used by the Plan's Board, Leadership and stakeholders to make data driven decisions.

Proposals shall be submitted in accordance with the terms and conditions of this RFP and any addenda issued hereto.

BACKGROUND

State Health Plan

The Plan provides health benefits coverage to more than 740,000 teachers and school personnel, State employees, retirees, current and former lawmakers, State university and community college personnel, and eligible dependents. The Services outlined in this RFP are focused on the approximately 572,000 self-funded Members. The mission of the State Health Plan is to improve the health and health care of North Carolina teachers, State employees, retirees, and their dependents, in a financially sustainable manner, thereby serving as a model to the people of North Carolina for improving their health and well-being.

Governance

The Treasurer, Executive Administrator, and the Board are designated as fiduciaries for the Plan. The powers and duties of the Treasurer are set forth in statute at N.C.G.S. § 135-48.30(f) and include setting benefits, premiums, co-pays, deductibles, and coinsurance percentages and maximums subject to approval of the Board. The Board's powers and duties are set forth at N.C.G.S. § 135-22 and include approving large contracts; approving premium rates, copays, and deductibles proposed by the Treasurer; and developing and maintaining a strategic plan. The North Carolina General Assembly determines member eligibility rules and establishes certain premium levels for the Plan.

Plan Designs

The Plan currently offers three self-funded Plan Designs. Two are copay-based PPO plans and one is a HDHP. The Plan Designs are evaluated on an annual basis and are likely to change prior to 2026.

Plan Vendors

The Plan contracts with a number of vendors to provide third party administrative, pharmacy benefit management and other related services:
• Aetna Life Insurance Company ("Aetna") is the contracted TPA for Claims and Related services for the Plan's three self-funded plan options.
• Humana, Inc., provides the two fully insured Medicare Advantage Plans.
• Caremark PCS Health, LLC, provides Pharmacy Benefit Management services ("PBM").
• Benefitfocus is the Plan's eligibility and enrollment services ("EES") vendor.

Vendor's Proposal shall constitute a firm offer that shall be held open for the period required herein ("Validity Period" above).

The Plan may exercise its discretion to consider modifications proposed by Vendors, but only if those modifications are proposed during the question-and-answer period in accordance with Section 2.5 Proposal Questions.

3.0 METHOD OF AWARD AND PROPOSAL EVALUATION PROCESS

3.1 METHOD OF AWARD

All Qualified Proposals will be evaluated, and awards will be made to the Vendor(s) meeting the specifications of this RFP and achieving the highest and best final evaluation, based on the criteria described below.

While the intent of this RFP is to award a Contract to a single Vendor, the Plan reserves the right to make separate awards to different Vendors for one or more line-items, to not award one or more line-items or to cancel this RFP in its entirety without awarding a Contract if it is considered to be most advantageous to the Plan to do so.

The Plan reserves the right to waive any minor informality or technicality in Proposals received.

3.2 CONFIDENTIALITY AND PROHIBITED COMMUNICATIONS DURING EVALUATION

While this RFP is under evaluation, the responding Vendor, including any Subcontractors and suppliers, is prohibited from engaging in conversations intended to influence the outcome of the evaluation. For more specific information on prohibited communications, see Section V, Paragraph 25 of Attachment B: Instructions to Vendors.

3.3 PROPOSAL EVALUATION PROCESS

The Plan shall review all Vendor responses to this RFP to confirm that they meet the specifications and requirements of the RFP. Only Responsive submissions will be evaluated.

a) The Plan will conduct a One-Step evaluation of Proposals:

Proposals will be received according to the method stated in Section 2.6 Proposal Submittal above.

All Proposals must be received by the issuing agency not later than the date and time specified in Section 2.4 RFP Schedule above, unless modified by an Addendum. Vendors are cautioned that this is a request for offers, not an offer or request to contract, and the Plan reserves the unqualified right to reject any and all offers at any time if such rejection is deemed to be in the best interest of the Plan, as described in, among others, Section V, Paragraph 11 of Attachment B: Instructions to Vendors.

At their option, the evaluators may request oral presentations or discussions with any or all of the Vendors for Clarification or to amplify the materials presented in any part of the Proposal. The Vendors are cautioned, however, that the evaluators are not required to request presentations or other Clarification—and often do not. Therefore, all Proposals should be complete and reflect the most favorable terms available from the Vendor.

The Plan shall conduct a comprehensive, fair, and impartial evaluation of the Proposals received in response to this request. Specific evaluation criteria are listed in Section 3.4 Evaluation Criteria below.

Upon completion of the evaluation process, including all necessary approvals, the Plan will make award(s) based on the evaluation and post the award(s) under the RFP number for this solicitation. Award of a Contract to one Vendor does not mean that the other Proposals lacked merit, but that, all factors considered, the selected Proposal was deemed most advantageous and represented the best value to the Plan.

The Plan reserves the right to negotiate with one or more Vendors, or to reject all original offers and negotiate with one or more sources of supply that may be capable of satisfying the requirement, and in either case to require the Vendor to submit

**Text:**
Proposal Number: 270-20250407DAS                    Vendor: ________________________________________

a BAFO based on discussions and negotiations with the Plan. If a BAFO is requested, then, once the Vendors' BAFOs are received, the Plan will recalculate the score as appropriate.

b) Evaluation Committee

An Evaluation Committee ("Committee") will be established to review each Proposal and recommend to the Executive Administrator a Vendor to be awarded the Contract. The Plan may engage the professional services of a different Plan vendor to assist in the evaluation process. The Plan reserves the right to alter the composition of the Committee or to designate other staff to assist in the process. Other designated staff and senior management from the Department of State Treasurer may attend any oral presentations that may occur during the evaluation process. However, all decisions regarding scoring and the final award recommendation will be made solely by Committee members.

The Committee will review and evaluate all Proposals that were submitted by the deadline specified in this RFP. This Committee will be responsible for the entire evaluation process and the evaluation will be conducted in accordance with the steps outlined below. Committee participants are obligated to keep information identified as trade secret and proprietary confidential.

Technical Proposals meeting the Minimum Requirements described in Section 5.1 will be considered and evaluated as follows:

1: Evaluation of Technical Proposal
   • Written Technical Proposal (Section 5.2.1 Standard Services, which includes Section 5.2.1.1 Implementation, 5.2.1.2 Account Management, 5.2.1.3 Business Solutions, and 5.2.1.4 User Experience)

2: Evaluation of Cost Proposal

3: Determination of Successful Proposal Based on the Combination of Technical & Cost

4: Adjustment of Score After BAFO, if Applicable

c) Approval for Contract Award

After approval by the Board, if applicable, and the Attorney General's Office, if applicable, the Plan's Executive Administrator will award the Contract to the bidder with the highest score. A Contract is not binding until the Plan's Executive Administrator has signed the Acceptance of Proposal.

3.4 EVALUATION CRITERIA

Proposals meeting the Minimum Requirements described in Section 5.1 will be evaluated under the Points-Based Evaluation methodology, and awarded based on the following criteria, to result in an award most advantageous to the Plan. The Technical Proposal and the Cost Proposal will be scored separately based on the overall point scale described below.

The total points scale will reflect the following weights:

Technical Proposal      50%
Cost Proposal          50%
Total:                 100%

## Page 18

**Text:**
Proposal Number: 270-20250407DAS                    Vendor: ________________________________________

Both the Technical Proposal and Cost Proposal will be based upon a maximum of 37 points each. Each item to be confirmed in the Technical Requirements shall be assigned one point. The following example will include the technical requirements to be evaluated.

**TABLE:**
| TECHNICAL AREAS | Maximum Points |
|---|---|
| Section 5.2.1.1 Implementation | 12 |
| Section 5.2.1.2 Account Management | 5 |
| Section 5.2.1.3 Business Solutions | 16 |
| Section 5.2.1.4 User Experience | 4 |
| Total | 37 |

The State will evaluate Cost Proposals submitted in accordance with Attachment A. The State will determine low cost by normalizing the scores as follows:

The Proposal with the lowest cost will receive a score of 37. All other competing Proposals will be assigned a portion of the maximum score using the formula:

37    x    [2 – (The cost of the Cost Proposal being evaluated / The cost of the lowest cost Proposal) ]

Vendors are cautioned that this is a request for offers, not a request to contract, and the State reserves the unqualified right to reject any and all offers when such rejection is deemed to be in the best interest of the State.

3.5 PERFORMANCE OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES

The Vendor shall complete ATTACHMENT E: LOCATION OF WORKERS UTILIZED BY VENDOR. In addition to any other evaluation criteria identified in this RFP, the Plan may also consider, for purposes of evaluating proposed or actual contract performance outside of the United States, how that performance may affect the following factors to ensure that any award will be in the best interest of the Plan:

a) Total cost to the State;
b) Level of quality provided by the Vendor;
c) Process and performance capability across multiple jurisdictions;
d) Protection of the Plan's information and intellectual property;
e) Availability of pertinent skills;
f) Ability to understand the Plan's Business Requirements and internal operational culture;
g) Particular risk factors such as the security of the Plan's information technology;
h) Relations with citizens and employees; and

This Section lists the requirements related to this RFP. By submitting a proposal, the Vendor agrees to meet all stated requirements in this Section as well as any other specifications, requirements, and terms and conditions stated in this RFP. If a Vendor is unclear about a requirement or specification or believes a change to a requirement would result in a better Proposal for the Plan to consider, the Vendor is urged to submit these items in the form of a question during the question-and-answer period in accordance with Section 2.5 Proposal Questions above.
