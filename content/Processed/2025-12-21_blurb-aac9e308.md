What: We’re building the standard model for biomedicine: a multimodal foundation model that unifies molecular, imaging, and longitudinal clinical data into a single, shared representation of the human patient. Our approach is to build the quiet backbone, not point applications so healthcare and biopharma teams can fine-tune and deploy intelligence on top.

Why now: The first team to establish a general patient representation becomes core infrastructure, and the window to do so is narrow. Biomedicine now has petabyte-scale multimodal data and clear commercial pull across a $100B+ AI-enabled drug development and healthcare software market—but no unifying model to make this data usable end-to-end. The first team that has credibly benchmarked a multimodal patient-level foundation model across tens of academic medical centers will have a huge credibility advantage and begin to leverage performance for other lead-reinforcing partnerships including data access and revenue.

Why us: Our team brings rare technical and pharma execution credibility from Prometheus, BMS, Genentech, AbbVie, Stripe, and Siemens, with state-of-the-art publications across genomics, radiology, longitudinal EHR modeling, radiology, and protein-interaction networks, positioning us to move faster than platform incumbents and application-layer startups. We already work with large pharma including Sanofi AstraZeneca, and top academic medical centers including MD Anderson, Memorial Sloan Kettering, Mt. Sinai, UC San Diego.

Strategy: We partner with both large pharma and with researchers at academic medical centers. Large pharma is where early revenue is realized. Academic researchers provide high quality validation data, expertise, and authority, and a low-regulatory-burden path toward adoption. Pharma follows academics who define and administer standard of care - validating with them is invaluable. For both groups, we provide a multimodal foundation model they use to achieve state-of-the-art performance.

— wedge case/ use case/ etc

Initial wedge / use cases:

For academic researchers: we power any clinically relevant biomedical AI - from prognostic modeling to treatment selection.

For pharma:  If we had to focus on one use case today, it’s clinical trial acceleration—starting with patient enrollment and site selection, which is what we’re actively delivering with Sanofi. Enrollment is the most time-critical bottleneck in drug development: delays cost ~$15M per day for a successful asset and ~$11M per month averaged across active trials. Improving enrollment speed and screening success compresses timelines, increases expected asset value, and often matters more than cost reduction alone. Beyond speed, the larger value is de-risking: failed or underpowered trials consume not just trial spend, but scarce development time and portfolio opportunity cost. Failing faster and earlier materially improves portfolio-level ROI.

We’re deliberately careful not to over-pin ourselves to a single application because many “different” use cases share the same underlying modeling problem. Enrollment requires predicting screening success, disease trajectory, and timing of line-of-therapy transitions. These are the same primitives needed for prognosis, trial design, market selection, and probability of technical and regulatory success based on treatment response versus standard of care, and ultimately commercial success (your asset will be a commercial success only if ai-driven clinical decision support recommends it).

We saw at BMS and Simbiosys that these models converge for the first ~90% of the problem; the final ~10% is bespoke validation and workflow integration. Our strategy is to build the shared patient-level world model that captures that common 90%, then sell to those who specialize rapidly per use case without rebuilding core intelligence, whether they are large pharma, pharma services, or clinical decision support systems.

Subject: Portfolio Co Intro - Standard Model Bio [H1-26 Series A]

Body:

XX, heads up, our portfolio company Standard Model Biomedicine (SMB) is meeting with select investors at JPM ahead of a Series A later in H1-26.

As background, SMB is building multimodal foundation models for biopharma and academic medical centers that unify molecular, imaging, and longitudinal clinical data into a single, shared representation of a human patient accessible through an API or a fine-tunable model. The company serves biopharma for multiple different use cases (enrollment, prognosis, trial design, market selection, PTRS, CDS, commercialization, etc) that share the same underlying modeling problem to tackle the full spectrum of the $100B pharma value chain across drug development and commercialization. Check out our SMB write-up if you’d like more context.

The 8-person core team, led by CEO/Co-founder, Kevin Brown, is genuinely one of our strongest and brings technical and pharma expertise from Prometheus, BMS, Genentech, AbbVie, Stripe, and Siemens. SMB has only raised ~$2.5M to date. If interested we’d be happy to intro!

Thanks in advance,

, with publications across genomics, radiology, longitudinal EHR modeling, radiology, and protein-interaction networks. The first company to establish this general patient representation becomes core infrastructure and generates a compounding data asset, and SMB is raising next year to scale their work to meet biopharma demand as customers look to outsource this work to drive performance gains.
