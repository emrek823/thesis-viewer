### Company Overview

- Earnest RCM: AI-native revenue cycle process outsourcing firm
- $120K ARR currently
- Team of 2: Luke (business development/on-site operations) + Rohan (engineering/account management)
- Looking to raise $2-3M at 10-15% dilution

### Go-to-Market Strategy

- Phase I: Target legacy RCM vendors first
	- Faster sales cycles (contracted in 4 weeks vs months with health systems)
	- No EHR integrations required
	- Vendors desperate to adopt AI to compete on margins
	- Current customer: $100M ARR multi-specialty vendor
- Phase II: Become the AI-native RCM firm
	- Take entire book of business from legacy vendors
	- Potential acquisition targets identified
	- Direct provider relationships through existing vendor partnerships

### Current Operations

- Voice AI collection calls to payers (live revenue)
	- Automated pair-by-pair rollout approach
	- Current contract has $300-400K upside potential
- Medical coding expansion coming
	- Large contract with Mount Sinai pass-through
	- Outpatient coding focus (vendor wants to shed low-margin work)
	- Mount Sinai fully aware and supportive of AI implementation
- Engineering bandwidth limiting growth
	- 3 ready-to-sign contracts pushed back due to capacity constraints
	- Strong inbound funnel from conference networking

### Partnership vs Competition Dynamic

- Legacy vendors increasingly dependent on AI to remain competitive
- Strategic approach: target low-margin services vendors want to offload
- Timeline: Could flip to direct competition within 1-2 years
- Market grab mentality: speed of vendor onboarding critical
- Next pipeline targets 20x larger than current customer
