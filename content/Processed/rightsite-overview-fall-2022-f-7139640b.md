# RIGHT SI+E
For non-emergency patients

RightSite solves avoidable ER admissions with its navigation and telehealth service, helping these patients access appropriate in-network, non-ER providers.

Non-emergency ER visits, including resultant observation stays and in-patient admissions, comprise half of all ER visits and cost $3,400, or 8x more than receiving the same care outside the ER. Avoidable ER visits overwhelm EMS systems and hospital ERs, creating sometimes dangerous delays in responding and caring for true emergencies. Most importantly, patients receiving non-emergency care from ERs experience long wait times, surprise bills, unnecessary services, and higher costs.

RightSite's service operates in two ways.

**EMS-Initiated Service** - Upon arriving at a 911 call, EMS crews connect on-demand to the RightSite Connect platform on their smartphone or internet-enabled device. EMS and their patient videoconference with a RightSite ER Physician and Navigator to confirm the non-emergency condition. The Navigator schedules an appropriate in-network non-emergency provider at a clinic or in the patient's home (virtual or in-person) and arranges non-ambulance round trip transportation if necessary. RightSite follows up with patients 24 hours later, often uncovering and solving additional social determinant needs that help these patients avoid a future trip to the ER.

**Proactive Outreach Service** - Many ER patients use the ER for non-emergency medical and social needs. RightSite's Navigators, trained in health psychology and motivational interviewing techniques, form relationships with these patients to identify the root causes of their otherwise avoidable ER use. Navigators then offer personalized navigation to appropriate in-network local clinical and social need resources for these patients.

# RIGHT SI+E
For non-emergency patients

RightSite's **Pilots** are live in Atlanta, where we have partnered with Atlanta Fire Rescue Department, and Cobb County Fire Department, and Metro Atlanta Ambulance Service. Of the non-emergency patients offered RightSite's service, 2 out of 3 accept the service and are successfully treated outside the ER. Patient satisfaction scores are consistently near 5/5. RightSite has been invited to expand across greater Atlanta, representing about 125,000 non-emergency 911 calls per year.

The **RightSite Compensation** model is a value-based provider for the EMS-Initiated Service with a fee-per-episode plus gainshare for successful navigations to in-network non-ER providers. The Proactive Outreach Service model is a per-member-per-month (PMPM) fee for engaged members.

Two Georgia **Case Studies** demonstrate RightSite's value.

The first case was a 65-year-old diabetic with mild heart failure who called her PCP complaining of arm swelling and pain. She told the nurse she had arm pain and swelling, probably related to her chronic bursitis. The nurse told her to call 911 as she was "high risk," which she did.

The second case was a 45-year-old with hypothyroidism who became dizzy at work after standing up. Her employer insisted she call 911.

After arrival, the EMS crews concluded neither patient had emergency conditions. They then contacted RightSite. The RightSite ER Physician did a telehealth visit alongside the medics. The physician agreed with the non-emergency assessments, explained non-ER treatment options to the patients, and offered the Navigators' assistance in scheduling in-network urgent care visits and round-trip non-ambulance transportation. In both cases, the patient accepted the offer to receive non-ER care, and the Navigator coordinated an Uber Health ride to the urgent care clinic.

The first patient was treated with Tylenol, and the Navigator scheduled a follow-up appointment with her PCP. The second patient was evaluated and found no significant conditions to treat. She was released from the clinic and returned home. A post-appointment follow-up call by the Navigators generated a 5 out of 5 customer satisfaction score for both.
