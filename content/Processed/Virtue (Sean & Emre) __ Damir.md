### Background & Context

- Overlapped with Michael in the lab and at a16z events
- Very excited to see what Michael is up to
- Damir is in super early stages of new ventures
- Currently exploring ideas independently and talking with potential cofounders

### Previous Experience at Valar Labs

- From Sweden, background in EE and mathematical modeling
- Pre-COVID work on virus spreading over networks modeling
- Came to Stanford to focus on AI and healthcare
- Joined Andrew Ng’s lab, led DBCell Morph project
	- Analyzed cell morphology to predict treatment outcomes in lymphoma
	- Published in Nature Scientific Data
	- Became genesis of Valar Labs
- Went through Lean Launchpad program (noted as best handbook for -1 to 0 phase)
- Focused on bladder cancer after extensive physician interviews
- Progressed through Pear accelerator

### Current Focus Areas

- Exploring RCM (Revenue Cycle Management) space
- Healthcare admin opportunities
- Considering pharma space (not yet deeply researched)

### RCM Pain Points & Observations

- Led sales and operations at Valar
- Experienced significant frustration with RCM structure despite:
	- Strong KOL backing
	- Top journal publications
	- Proven technology meeting unmet needs
- Insurance companies consistently finding denial reasons
- Medical necessity claims particularly problematic
- Issue extends across diagnostics, devices, and drugs

### Potential Solution Direction

- Focusing on denial management as initial wedge
- Interviewed 50+ people for denial management roles
- Current process limitations:
	- Medical affairs writes generic templates
	- Templates lack patient-specific medical necessity justification
	- Disconnect between clinical expertise and administrative functions
- Exploring LLM-based solutions
- Considering YC’s RFI about full end-to-end company approach
