*   Manipulated into commonly needed pivot tables (by department, rolling financial period, etc.)
*   Manually updated to answer queries from business users

## Slide 9: Value to working with us vs. building internally

**Value to working with us vs. building internally**

There are a few things that make our AI special and easy-to-use...

*   **Data Model** | We build the translation layer for AI to easily work with your data, so you don't have to
    *   *Example: Significant manual effort to connect ChatGPT to you underlying Financial Data in a way that it knows how to read and analyze it like a P&L (i.e., general ledger data)*
*   **Business Logic** | We train our AI on your business logic, LLMs don't know the right rules to follow
    *   *Example: ChatGPT doesn't know how an organization specifically calculates wRVUs*
*   **Performance** | We run significant evaluation on AI outputs and test / select the best models
    *   *Example: ChatGPT may not be as effective at answering physician productivity questions as Gemini*
*   **Functionality** | We're building beyond chat to support report automation, dashboards, and more
    *   *Example: ChatGPT has one form-factor, chat-based interactions. It is not able to easily manage and maintain complex automated reports, show consistent dashboards. It's not build for this workflow.*
