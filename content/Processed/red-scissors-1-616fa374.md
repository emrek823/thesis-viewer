1.  **Red Scissor only requires a prescription**
    *   Virtual pharmacy puts us in existing pipes
2.  **Red Scissor is one solution for every Rx**
    *   AI changes cost structure to create flexibility
3.  **Red Scissor fully takes over the process**
    *   Interoperability allows direct data access

## Slide 5: Existing solutions make provider's life more complicated, not less

*   **Cosentyx** (secukinumab) **+ aetna**
    *   (Image of "vaetna" form)
    *   → **CVS specialty**
    *   (Image of CVS forms)
*   **Enbrel** (etanercept) **+ CareFirst**
    *   **Different process and pharmacy for each drug / payer combination**
    *   (Image of "CareFirst" forms)
    *   → **CVS specialty**
    *   (Image of CVS forms)
*   **RINVOQ** (upadacitinib) **+ Cigna**
    *   (Image of "Cigna" forms)
    *   → **accredo**
    *   (Image of Accredo forms)
*   **Manufacturer "hub services" perpetuate that complexity plus require other effort**
    *   **[RINVOQ Complete Enrollment Forms]**
        *   RINVOQ Complete (Rheumatology) Enrollment and prescription form
        *   RINVOQ Complete (Dermatology-Adults) Enrollment and prescription form
        *   RINVOQ Complete (Gastroenterology) Enrollment and prescription form
        *   RINVOQ Complete (Dermatology-Pediatrics 12+) Enrollment and prescription form
        *   RINVOQ Complete Enrollment & Prescription Form (Dermatology-Adults) EXAMPLE

## Slide 6: We solve access while eliminating burden and maintaining choice

1.  **Provider writes Rx**
    *   Any provider can send prescriptions directly to us like they would to CVS.
2.  **We handle red tape**
    *   We process end-to-end and help patient pick fulfillment option.
3.  **Pharmacy fills Rx**
    *   Any pharmacy can receive transfers to dispense medications.
4.  **Patient gets Rx**
    *   Patients have visibility into Rx status with ETA throughout.

**Expensive injectables become as painless to prescribe as generic statins.**

## Slide 7: Approval process is nightmare for all but providers in particular

**[Flowchart of Approval Process]**

1.  **Provider writes and sends prescription to pharmacy**
2.  **Pharmacy claim attempts to fill Rx, claim is rejected**
3.  **Pharmacy sends requirements to provider to address**
4.  **Provider fills out form based on specific situation**
    *   *(Rejection/appeal cycle can expand to months)*
5.  *(May require retrieving records from patients' previous providers)*
    **Provider compiles available medical records to attach**
6.  **Provider decides between appeal, exclusion, or forfeit**
    *   If Provider decides to appeal:
        *   **Provider submits prior auth request to insurer**
        *   **Insurer rejects prior auth request with explanation**
            *   (Back to "Pharmacy sends requirements to provider to address" or "Provider decides between appeal, exclusion, or forfeit" - implied loop)
        *   **Insurer provides approval for coverage**
            *   **Pharmacy informed of prior auth approval**
7.  **Pharmacy provides out-of-pocket cost after insurance**
8.  **Provider and consumer search for cost assistance**
9.  **Provider sends set of coupons, etc. to pharmacy**
10. **Pharmacy confirms coupons, etc. and if cost is affordable**
11. **Pharmacy submits claim, etc. and dispenses drug**
12. **Patient receives drug from pharmacy**

*Can involve multiple attempts in complex situations*

## Slide 8: Brand drugs are gate-kept by insurers, creating loss for everyone

**Patients lose on access**
*   **37%** of Rx abandoned due to delays and denials

**Providers lose on time**
*   **13 hrs** per week spent per provider on process

**Manufacturers lose sales**
*   **$250B+** in lost revenue due to non-adherence

## Slide 9: $600B+ spent on Rx and growing majority is high-cost brand drugs

**[Stacked Bar Chart Data: Total Rx Spend (in Billions $)]**

| Year | Brand ($B) | Generic ($B) | Total ($B) | Projected |
| :--- | :--------- | :----------- | :--------- | :-------- |
| 2017 | 401        | 60           | 461        | No        |
| 2018 | 425        | 55           | 480        | No        |
| 2019 | 447        | 55           | 502        | No        |
| 2020 | 466        | 55           | 521        | No        |
| 2021 | 521        | 53           | 574        | No        |
| 2022 |            |              | 603        | Yes       |
| 2023 |            |              | 633        | Yes       |
| 2024 |            |              | 665        | Yes       |

*(Note: For projected years (2022-2024), only total values are explicitly shown by the chart bars, not individual Brand/Generic components.)*
