# GC HEALTHCARE PORTFOLIO

Platform Benchmarking & Returns Triangulation
November 2022

GENERAL CATALYST
PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL

## Slide 2: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1 GC Portfolio Platforms Growth and Margin Analysis
* GC Platforms have generally seen (or are expected to see) ~3 years of 100%+ Growth
* Generally, early-stage services companies tended to exhibit higher growth profiles, but decay quicker than that of early-stage software comps
* Our top services companies exhibit growth/burn ratios of ~1.0x (defined as current year revenue growth / current year operating burn due to data limitations). Our best software companies are at ~0.4x due to timing of cARR to revenue recognition dynamics
* Internal comps were leveraged across our broader returns analysis (including both immediate forward growth and long-term decay)
* Unfortunately, quality of data was not sufficient to a) analyze our full GC HC portfolio, or b) analyze drivers of gross & EBITDA margin evolution over time

2 Public Comps Analysis of Margins and Valuation
* Steady-state services companies operate at 20% EBITDA Margins and 9% FCF Margins (45% EBITDA to FCF Conversion)
* Steady-state software companies operate at 40% EBITDA Margins and 28% FCF Margins (70% EBITDA to FCF Conversion)
* Thus, if forward growth profiles were equivalent, software comps should command a ~3x premium on a revenue basis or ~1.5x premium on a EBITDA basis vs. services comps
* Both services and software public comps exhibit moderate correlation (R2 of 0.3-0.5) between forward revenue growth and EV/NTM Revenue multiples

3 Returns Triangulation to Inform Entry Valuation
* When we try to develop returns models, we encounter companies with widely differing business models, forward growth profiles, steady-state margins, burn, etc. However, investors may apply a one-size-fits-all approach when using comps, either at entry or exit, which may not appropriately reflect how the business should truly be valued
* Our returns triangulation methodology is informed by hard data from internal GC HC comps as well as steady-state HC comps
* Services companies could be priced at 10-14x NTM Revenue (early) or 3-4x NTM Revenue (late)
* Software companies could be priced at ~18x NTM Revenue (early) or 10-13x NTM Revenue (late)

4 VBC Valuation Deep-Dive
* Earlier in Q4, we conducted an analysis to inform how value-based care business are valued, especially as companies like Homeward / Eleanor were deciding how deep they wanted to enter into full-capitation contracts (given it improves top-line revenue)
* Our analysis clearly demonstrated that forward gross profit has a much higher predictive value than that of forward revenue across comp sets, with forward GP having a R2 value of 0.825 vs. 0.255 for forward revenue
* However, for certain comps that exhibit significant ramping of gross margin across different regions, such as Agilon and OSH, forward GP multiples appear to be materially higher than peers, suggesting that the public markets adjust for a pro-forma gross margin

1 Year 1 NTM revenue growth figures were used to power our returns triangulation analysis, albeit with a slight discount due to survivorship bias (300% for Early Services, 100% for Late Services, 175% for Early Software, 100% for Late Software)
2 Decay coefficient refers to the incremental decay if growth is modeled as a logistic function, where gn = go * e^kx, where gn is the revenue growth rate in year n, and k is the decay coefficient. For purposes of modeling, a decay coefficient of 0.4-0.5 was used based on portfolio averages
3 Our top services companies exhibit growth/burn ratios of ~1.0x (defined as current year revenue growth / current year operating burn due to data limitations). Our best software companies are at ~0.4x due to timing of CARR to revenue recognition dynamics

Source: Portfolio Company collated financials, existing terms sheets, Pitchbook; 2022E financials based on latest board projections as of October 2022; Year 0 and starting TEV refer to 1st year of financial data (not time of GC investment); comps with <3 years of consecutive historical data were eliminated

## Slide 8: ③ RETURNS TRIANGULATION METHODOLOGY
**Problem:** When we try to develop returns models, we encounter companies with widely differing business models, forward growth profiles, steady-state margins, burn, etc. However, investors may apply a one-size-fits-all approach when using comps, either at entry or exit, which may not appropriately reflect how the business should truly be valued.

**Objective:** Develop a returns model to triangulate what we should pay at entry, with consideration for differences in forward growth trajectories and business models. This analysis would be supported by hard data we have observed within the GC portfolio and evolution of public companies in steady-state vs. high-level projections

**Approach:**
* **P&L Projections:** Forward growth trajectory based on observations of early-stage and late-stage platforms within the GC HC portfolio. Growth decay modeled based off of a logistic function. Initial EBITDA margins based on GC HC portfolio, whereas steady-stage margins based on average across maturing/matured public HC comps (and non-HC for software)
* **Cash Flow Projections:** Based on average steady-state cash flor metrics from maturing/matured public HC comps
* **Hold Period:** Assumed to be ~6 years for early-stage investments and ~4 years for late-stage investments
* **Returns Threshold:** Assumed to be ~6-10x for early-stage investments and ~3-5x for late-stage investments
* **Exit Methodology:** At exit, two valuation methods are used:
    * **DCF Exit:** A long-term discounted cash flow model is built to assess the intrinsic value of the company at exit. This methodology better accounts for cash flow dynamics and nonlinearity of valuation with respect to forward growth, but is heavily dependent on market assumptions such as discount rate
    * **Comps-Based Exit:** At time of exit, exit valuation is determined by a forward revenue multiple adjusted for growth based on a linear regression of public comps to account for the different growth profiles a company might exhibit at exit (similar to how we think about entry)
* **Implied Entry Valuation:** Once we determine exit value, we back into the implied forward revenue multiple based on our returns threshold

Valuation spread between Early and Late services companies driven by larger forward revenue growth rates at the early stage (albeit at a higher decay). Comps-based exit methodology suggests a premium for Early companies vs. a discount for Late companies likely driven by nonlinear relationship between growth and valuation

## Slide 12: ④ VALUE-BASED CARE VALUATION PRINCIPLES - SUMMARY PERSPECTIVES
* Forward gross profit has a much higher predictive value than that of forward revenue across comp sets
    * Across public comps forward GP correlation has a R² value of 0.733 vs. 0.008 for forward revenue
    * Across private comps forward GP correlation has a R² value of 0.848 vs. 0.504 for forward revenue
    * Across consolidated comps forward GP correlation has a R² value of 0.825 vs. 0.255 for forward revenue
* Value-based care businesses tend to command a premium over D2C / FFS businesses due to higher GP to EBITDA conversion in steady-state
* Pro-forma gross margin is the largest driver of forward revenue multiples to forward gross profit multiples, which includes consideration for external medical expense, internal cost of care, and partner share dynamics
* Certain comps that are predicated on a significant site-level profitability ramp (e.g., OSH) tend to deviate from peers due to outsized gross profit growth vs. revenue due to GP leverage
* While pricing of private comps is dependent on market timing, general trends for multiples paid vs. forward growth still hold

PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL | 16

## Slide 17: KEY QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION
1. When we underwrite a “GC Base Case,” how do we start to benchmark the forward growth we may project vs. what we have seen in our portfolio (e.g., ~2-3 years of 100%+ growth at the early-stage)?
2. From a current-year revenue growth / operating burn standpoint, how do we bring the rest of our portfolio to metrics that best-in-class GC portcos exhibit (~1.0x for Services, ~0.4x for Software)?
3. Given the significant impact pro-forma gross / EBITDA / FCF margins can have on multiples, should we start to more critically evaluate what businesses could like in steady-state from a margin profile standpoint? How can we refine the right comp sets based on the business model (vs. using best-in-class digital health comps)?
4. Is it appropriate to use non-HC verticalized software comps to demonstrate what a HC software business could look like in steady-state?
5. The returns model has provided guidelines on suggested valuation comps, anchored to average growth rates we see. Is this type of work helpful as we model returns for specific investment opportunities?
6. How do we hold ourselves accountable when "paying up" for a leading platform asset in a thematically attractive subsector, without sacrificing our return threshold (and not adjusting factors such as hold period)?
7. Given the learnings from the VBC valuation work, should we start to look at multiples more holistically on a pro-forma gross profit basis (vs. revenue)?
