### Executive Overview

#### Company description

#### Market Overview

#### Why Now?

#### Why does Provider-Focused FP&A need a vertical solution?

### Current Customers

#### Why are customers interested in buying the product?

Requests from business users/strategic decision makers demand is higher than capacity. CFOs are spending way too much on FTEs in this area and the team could be doing even higher value strategic advisory work. P&L improvements in healthcare providers can have big swings even at a 1% improvement for 3.5 billion dollar organizations. Headwinds of interest rates, medicare reimbursement reductions, costs going up and complexity. Board pressure to include AI. Additional, easier justification for something that improves the financial health of an organization.

#### What are you currently building for Duly and Springfield?

PhsyiDuly we are building a physician productivity agent (3 FTEs allocated to this) and many operators business users (300+) reach out to FP&A team about this everyday.

Springfield we are building a service line analysis for Radiology/Lab that many business users reach out to finance daily/weekly/monthly to get answers on.

We will continue to do service line analysis for additionally departments for springfield that we can also sell to Duly.

Physician Compensation is also something we are doing for Duly and we can also do that for Springfield.

After that both want FTE/Overtime Analysis Agents.

After that both want Pharmacy Spend Analysis Agents.

#### How does the CARR turn to ARR with Duly/Springfield?

When we deploy the agents. Our first Agent with Duly is set to be deployed at the end of March. After initial data set up and building we should be able to deploy 3 additional agents with Duly over the next 3 months, especially with added team members.

Springfield Clinic Kicks off 3/17 so 3 months from there(June 17th) is communication to customers of when the first agent deployed. Additionally, with added team members we can launch multiple agents in parallel with Springfield like we are doing with Duly.

### Product

#### Who is the user? What is the form factor?

This is best for business users/strategic decision makers because it mimics what they are doing today where they are either using chatgpt in their personal life or reaching out to the FP&A team through some sort of chat interface (teams/email etc)

Each form factor serves different user personas in a healthcare FP&A setting:

#### What is the timeline for your product roadmap?

We are aiming to have 5-7 Agents built, with a platform and rolled out all our customers in the next 6 months. This will give us $1M+ ACVs to current and new customers. 2026 will be about creating more on ACT 2 and 3 where we create more and more agents that we can increase value for customers and increase ACVs plus creating the true P&L of the future.

#### How do you leverage LLMs?

### Data Integration

#### What data sources do you need to connect to? How do you integrate?

Data Warehouse, Contracts and MGMA Benchmark Data…We don’t need real time data, and 24 hour data suffices…for customers without a  data warehouse, this actually makes our platform more valuable for Act 3 and we can do nightly uploads, SFTPs or additional types of uploads to mimic what would be in data warehouse

#### How long does it take to implement an agent or the FP&A platform at a new customer?

It will take between 4-6 weeks for pre-built agents at new customers. (data integration/security being the bulk of that time)

### Commercial / GTM

#### What is the business model?

We charge an implementation fee plus per agent. We are using Agents in Act 1 to act like an FP&A Analyst that is doing the job of physician productivity or physician compensation. We are just delivering that in a chat based interface but the agent is using an advanced data pipeline, playbook and prompting to be able to give insights and real time questioning in tabular format, language based format.

#### What percentage of the business is consulting?

There is no consulting like revenue, it is implementation costs to do data integrations.

#### What is unit economics?

80% Gross margins (17% inference +3 % cloud costs)

#### Where will you go after the medical group market?

We can then scale to medium to large health systems that have medical groups and similar use cases. Additionally, digital health companies, homecare, and other unique type providers.

#### What is Stratum?

Stratum is a physician shared services platform owned by 20 Large Medical Groups. We made a strategic Partnership with them that in first 14 months they will assist us in getting 5 medical groups out of the 20. They additionally, have 180 medical group members we can reach out to. We will continue to build distribution channels like this to take the market quickly.

### Competition

#### What is Translucent’s moat?

High barrier to entry to get physician productivity, comp, pharmacy etc data. To re-create the workflows would need to work with unique customer data. Training the agents with unique prompts for these workflows takes domain expertise and working with many customers. High Switching costs once integrated with data and continue to be very sticky with a lot of users incorporating into every day work. Take over more and more of the FP&A workflow with net new agents (data flywheel)

#### Why couldn’t a hyperscalers or broader FP&A tools do what translucent is doing?

Hyperscalers will be good at Agentic work that is horizontal across many industries like doing an “expense report”. However, they won’t create a physician compensation analysis or physician productivity report.

#### What about other healthcare competitors like revenue cycle companies?

Our GTM is very unique where we are focused on medical groups, a very underserved market where we can land grab very quickly, if there is a fast follow on we will have already seized that market.
