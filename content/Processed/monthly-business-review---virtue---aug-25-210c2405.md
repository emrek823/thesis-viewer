# Aug - Customer conversation updates
Overview: 30 customer prospect convos logged

### Highlights
1.  **Go-live momentum across pharma, 3PL, and diagnostics:** Beacon Biosignals (brand portal; Sep 8 go-live; Uniphar integration + branded emails); Cardinal Health (Oct 1 pilot; Okta SSO aligned; security demo positive; FedEx REST live).
2.  **Strong pull for white-label portals, AI call/email interventions, and lane scorecards:** McKesson (Asembia) (AI calls "pretty awesome"; modular use), UChicago Medicine (white-label + AI), FUJIFILM Irvine Scientific (white-label links; proactive delay alerts; temp excursions pain), BioIVT (customer-facing portal to cut “where's my stuff" calls), Alexion/AstraZeneca Rare Disease (unified control tower + temp intelligence), HappiLabs/Science Exchange (outsourcing ETA tracking), SmartSense (partnering to embed ZoomLogi analytics/AI).
3.  **Channel & partner leverage expanding reach.** Uniphar (Beacon's 3PL) expressed interest to use with their other customers. ShipRx rev-share pathway into diagnostics/med-device shippers; SmartSense (Digi) exploring backend integration + co-sell;

### Lowlights
1.  **ROI sensitivity & low volumes slow decisions in smaller orgs:** Scholar Rock (2-3 shipments/mo; no VP approver), GBC (price/ROI challenged), Sana Biotech (adoption post-2026).
2.  **Pipeline delays:** UChicago (informatics bandwidth), Corewell (Epic/MyChart), Hackensack Meridian (clinical team buy-in; warehouse 2026), Verily (internal approvals), Generate Bio (DM role change), Guardant (stakeholder on leave).

### Key quotes
*   "That AI calling was pretty awesome." Natalie Bedford, McKesson (SVP S Pharmaceutical Distribution Services) – Validates appetite for automated interventions and white-label comms.
*   "I get the value of your product all day long." Tom Ruginis (HappiLabs CEO / now Science Exchange). Clear acknowledgment of control-tower and automation value vs. manual ops.
*   "We don't have any way to track the deliveries within the hospital." Motz Feinberg (Chief Supply Chain Officer at Cedars-Sinai). Captures the intra-facility visibility gap for health systems

### Job Title: Founding Lead Engineer

**Company Overview:**
ZoomLogi is the AI-native operating system for the $100B pharma supply chain, unifying shipment data to deliver real-time monitoring, disruption prediction, and automated resolution via AI voice and email – bringing Amazon-grade visibility to life-saving medicines. With a multi-million-dollar pipeline, six-figure ARR, and tens of thousands of weekly tracked shipments, in just a few months, we’re already serving SMBs through Fortune 100 customers. Backed by General Catalyst and leaders from AstraZeneca, BMS, Cardinal Health, Gilead, and J&J, we’re on track to become the default visibility layer for pharma.

**Position Overview:**
You’ll own the end-to-end architecture and delivery of our platform — spanning frontend, backend, and data streaming. Day one, you’ll ship product and productionize systems for scale, reliability, and security in a regulated environment. As we grow, you’ll recruit and mentor the early team, set engineering standards, and help shape company culture.

**Key Responsibilities:**
*   **Product Development & Platform Build-Out:**
    *   Extend real-time visibility, alerting, scorecarding, and AI-driven voice/email workflows.
    *   Drive the development of ML-based recommendation systems (routing, provider/location optimization, risk modeling).
*   **Scalable Infrastructure:**
    *   Design and evolve a resilient, low-latency streaming platform capable of handling hundreds of thousands of data-point updates every 5-10 minutes and scaling to 1,000+ users.
    *   Ensure all systems and applications comply with data security, privacy, and other industry standards (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR, SOC 2, etc.).
    *   Collaborate with the Head of Integrations to enhance data aggregation capabilities and build low-latency infrastructure for real-time platform updates.
    *   Prioritize system stability, performance, and scalability to support rapid customer growth.
*   **Team Building & Leadership:**
