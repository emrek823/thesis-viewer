**Table: Effect of New Range on Other Target Values**

| Target Value                         | Process Step     | Target Value Change | p-Value  |
|--------------------------------------|------------------|---------------------|----------|

| Diafiltered Purified Toxoid Pre-Sterile Filtration | Purification     | Not significant     | Not significant |

We also compared the distribution of final yield across all batches versus those meeting the proposed microbial threshold. The KDE plot below demonstrates a rightward shift in the distribution when filtering for microbial count ≤207.5 CFU/g. This shift visually reinforces the improvement in yield performance under the suggested constraint.

**Chart: KDE Distribution of Target Value**
*   **X-axis:** Target Value (unlabeled, implied)
*   **Y-axis:** Density
*   **Legend:** hgdshg, Suggested Threshold
*   **Data points (approximate for curves):**
    *   Two density curves are shown, one peaking around 0.075 and another shifted to the right peaking around 0.05.

## Slide 8: Business Model

**Header:** Business Model

Katalyze AI generates revenue both from Agents Deployed and Platform Fees for data access and compute. This model scales with customer size and supports a strong unit economics.

### Pricing

*   **$50-90k** Annual Revenue per Agent
*   **+**
*   **$50-200k** Annual Platform Fee

### ACV (Annual Contract Value)

*   **Enterprise:** $8-12M*
*   **CDMO & Mid Market:** $0.8-1M*
*   **Biotech Startups:** $80-200K*

**Footnote:**
\* Based on 20 sites and 7 agents per site on average for enterprise. Assuming 10 Agents for Mid-Market and CDMOs & 1-2 Agent for Biotech.

## Slide 10: Market Size

**Header:** Market Size

A $100B+ TAM across pharma, cosmetics, chemicals & food.

**Concentric Circles Chart:**

*   **BEACHHEAD Commercial Manufacturing:** $6.7B
*   **SAM Pharma manufacturing & Scale Up:** $34.6B
    *   CMC
    *   Tech Transfer
    *   Process Development
*   **TAM Other Process Manufacturing:** $100B+
    *   Chemicals
    *   Advanced Materials
    *   Complex Food Processing
    *   Cosmetics & Personal Care
    *   Nutraceutical industry

**Footnote:**
There are more than 4700 drug registered in the drug bank. Each drug could be manufactured in more than 2 sites (avg. 2.5) & assuming 7 agents + platform for each site resulting in 6.7B for beachhead. Adding 20k drugs in development + higher costs of development modules resulting in 34B in SAM.
