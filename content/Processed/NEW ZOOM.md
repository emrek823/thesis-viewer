### Business Model Transition

- SOWs currently all over the place
- New model: Tuva Enterprise + product add-ons; receiving positive customer feedback
- Included will be the first contract with new model
- Moving away from “special snowflake” custom implementations
- Shifting from data warehouse integrations to containerized solution:
	- Data engineers currently use dbt in their warehouses
	- Enterprise version moves pipelines outside data warehouse
	- Trade-off: Less flexibility but more consistent delivery

### Pricing & Revenue Model

- 3-tier pricing structure based on data sources:
	- Silver: $10K/month ($120K/year)
	- Contract length affects pricing:
		- 3-year contract: Standard rate ($360K total for Silver)
		- 2-year contract: Price increase
		- 1-year contract: 30% price increase
- Maximum ACV potential: $1.2M for 100 data sources (enterprise only)
- Enterprise implementation advantages:
	- 5-minute installation vs 1 FTE effort
	- Includes analytics support and SLAs
	- Comparable products cost >$1M/year
- Market segment variations:
	- Tech companies (e.g., Hinge): 300 datasets, $3M potential
	- Value-based care providers: Limited budgets

### Fundraising Strategy

Parallel processes underway:

- Smaller checks:
	- Recent: $250K at $37.5M post-money valuation
	- Cash runway until January
	- Additional $1M revenue expected
- Seeking $1M to balance sheet:
	- Need to scale product side
	- Urgent hiring needs
	- Current cash burn situation critical

### Ongoing Investment Conversations

- Series A discussions:
	- Healthier (primary focus)
	- Two main asks:
		- Customer and pipeline documentation (build and send to EK tonight)
		- Financials (simplified annual revenue/expenses vs detailed pro-forma)
- Additional conversations:
	- Acrew (afternoon meeting)
	- Teamworthy (noted as not preferred)
	- A16z (Jay) - showing interest, waiting for more traction

### Immediate Actions

- Build customer pipeline document
- Prepare simplified financial model showing:
	- Annual revenue levels
	- Expenses structure
	- GTM strategy
	- R&D expenses
- Focus on clear story for transition between business models
