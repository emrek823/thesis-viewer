*Note: Specific client lines are difficult to precisely extract from the visual chart due to overlap and density. The values are read from labels where clearly visible, otherwise estimated from graph lines. SAFD-TX, GEMS-GA, HNRY-GA, and BEAU-TX are the largest clients by activation.*
*The chart title "LTM - Activations by Client" and Y-axis "Activations" are clear.*
*The data points seem to represent the volume for each client, rather than an average duration.*

*   For calls coming through Dial Pad, we have hard coded this total based on historical averages of 10 seconds and continue to monitor monthly.

## AVERAGE TIME TO EMS RELEASE:

*   Calculation begins with start time as the Episode Created time and duration ends when EMS is released from call.
*   Dispatch initiated calls will have a shorter EMS Release duration because a separate call back is made to close out issue in CAD.

## AVG DURATION TO CLOSE LOOP W/DISPATCH:

*   Calculation begins with start time as the Episode Created time and duration ends when the Navigator clicks the "Callback Completed" box on the Dispatch intake form in RightSite.
*   If Navigator forgets to click the check box the timer keeps running and duration will need to be adjusted.
*   Audit report has been created to identify open call back times.

*Note: The numbers within the stacked bars represent an unclear metric, possibly segment-specific average duration or call count. The overall average duration for each month is explicitly labeled on top of each bar. The client counts are estimated from the visual stacking.*
*Beaumont (green), Grady (gray), Henry (light blue), JFRD (orange), SAFD (dark blue), SSPR (yellow).*
*The chart seems to primarily show the contribution of different clients to the total volume of dispatch calls (stacked bars, total height represents volume, though no Y-axis label) and the overall average duration to close loop with dispatch (numbers on top of bars). The numbers inside segments for Beaumont, Henry, SAFD, SSPR, etc., are the `average duration` for that client, not the count. The height of the bar represents the `number of calls` for that client for that month. Given the overall average duration is displayed on top, and numbers within segments are consistent with duration, it's more likely these represent average duration for specific client calls that month. The Y-axis values (0-900) likely represent a cumulative measure, not individual duration.*
*Re-interpretation based on careful review:* The numbers inside the segments (e.g., 19, 20, 18) are actually the *average duration for that specific client's calls* for that month. The *height of the bar* represents the total count of calls for all clients for that month. So the table should reflect the count of calls for each client (estimated from bar heights) and the average durations labeled on top. The chart is titled "Avg Duration to Close Loop with Dispatch (Minutes)", and values like 18, 19, 20 are given for overall average. The stacked segments show the total *volume* of calls, segmented by client. The numbers inside the segments (18, 19, 20) represent the average duration for *each client's calls* for that month.
*Given the ambiguity and lack of clear Y-axis label for call counts, and the explicit label of average duration per month on top of the bars, I'll extract the average duration for each client as labelled, and the total count visually estimated, but prioritize the overall monthly average.*
*Let's assume the numbers (18, 19, 20) inside the bars are the average duration for *each specific client* for that month. The overall average duration for the month is then shown on top of the stacked bar. The stacked portions represent the *volume* of calls for each client (not duration). Without a Y-axis, call volume cannot be accurately extracted. I'll stick to extracting the average durations as numbers on the chart.*
