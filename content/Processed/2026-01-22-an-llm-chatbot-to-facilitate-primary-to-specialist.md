## Abstract

Patient-facing large language models (LLMs) hold potential to streamline inefficient transitions from primary to specialist care. We developed the preassessment (PreA), an LLM chatbot co-designed with local stakeholders, to perform the general medical consultations for history-taking, preliminary diagnoses, and test ordering that would normally be performed by primary care providers and to generate referral reports for specialists. PreA was tested in a randomized controlled trial involving 111 specialists from 24 medical disciplines across two health centers, where 2,069 patients (1,141 women; 928 men) were randomly assigned to use PreA independently (PreA-only), use it with staff support (PreA-human), or not use it (No-PreA) before specialist consultation. The trial met its primary end points with the PreA-only group showing significantly reduced physician consultation duration (28.7% reduction; 3.14 ± 2.25 min) compared to the No-PreA group (4.41 ± 2.77 min; *P* < 0.001), alongside significant improvements in physician-perceived care coordination (mean scores 113.1% increase; 3.69 ± 0.90 versus 1.73 ± 0.95; *P* < 0.001) and patient-reported communication ease (mean scores 16.0% increase; 3.99 ± 0.62 versus 3.44 ± 0.97; *P* < 0.001). Equivalent outcomes between the PreA-only and PreA-human groups confirmed the autonomous operation capability. Co-designed PreA outperformed the same model with additional fine-tuning on local dialogues across clinical decision-making domains. Co-design with local stakeholders, compared to passive local data collecting, represents a more effective strategy for deploying LLMs to strengthen health systems and enhance patient-centered care in resource-limited settings.

## Main

The growing burden of multimorbidity and aging populations has exposed vulnerabilities in healthcare delivery worldwide[1](#ref-CR1 "Academy of Medical Sciences.

China’s health system exemplifies this crisis: according to the 2023 Statistical Bulletin on China’s Health Sector Development, hospital visits reached 4.26 billion in 2023 (11.5% annual increase), while only 59.2% of public hospitals offered appointment systems, driving inefficient care-seeking pathways that overwhelm outpatient services. This imposes a dual burden: specialists face patient consultations without referrals[11](/articles/s41591-025-04176-7#ref-CR11 "Gordon, G. H., Baker, L. & Levinson, W. Physician-patient communication in managed care. Western J. Med. 163, 527 (1995)."), leading to prolonged diagnostic timelines[12](/articles/s41591-025-04176-7#ref-CR12 "Dugdale, D.

Local Reg. Anesth. 13, 171 (2020)."); concurrently, patients endure protracted waiting times and fragmented care[17](/articles/s41591-025-04176-7#ref-CR17 "Li, Y., Gong, W., Kong, X., Mueller, O. & Lu, G. Factors associated with outpatient satisfaction in tertiary hospitals in China: a systematic review. Int. J. Environ. Res.

Effect of hospitalist workload on the quality and efficiency of care. JAMA Intern. Med. 174, 786–793 (2014)."). Although interim solutions like nurse-led triage exist, they often lack the training for comprehensive patient assessment and chronic disease management[19](/articles/s41591-025-04176-7#ref-CR19 "Jin, X. et al. The roles and responsibilities of general practice nurses in China: a qualitative study. BMC Primary Care 25, 331 (2024)."). Addressing these systemic inefficiencies in resource-limited settings requires scalable solutions that can transform strained clinical workflows.

Large language models (LLMs) possess transformative potential to re-engineer hospital workflows and address the systemic inefficiencies amplified by escalating demand. However, current applications remain largely confined to support healthcare professionals in controlled settings, for example, responding to patient portal messages[20](/articles/s41591-025-04176-7#ref-CR20 "Ayers, J. W. et al. Comparing physician and artificial intelligence chatbot responses to patient questions posted to a public social media forum. JAMA Intern. Med. 183, 589–596 (2023)."),[21](/articles/s41591-025-04176-7#ref-CR21 "Chen, S. et al. The effect of using a large language model to respond to patient messages. Lancet Digit. Health 6, e379–e381 (2024)."), aiding clinical reasoning in experimental environments[22](/articles/s41591-025-04176-7#ref-CR22 "Goh, E. et al.

Large language models for preventing medication direction errors in online pharmacies. Nat. Med. 30, 1574–1582 (2024)."), with limited integration into real-time clinical decision-making. Critically, evidence is lacking for LLM chatbots that directly interact with socioeconomically diverse patient populations while supporting both curative and caring aspects of medicine in high-volume clinical environments[25](/articles/s41591-025-04176-7#ref-CR25 "Ong, J. C. L. et al. Artificial intelligence, ChatGPT, and other large language models for social determinants of health: Current state and future directions. Cell Rep. Med. 5, 101356 (2024).").

Bridging this gap requires overcoming two critical barriers: mitigating the systematic biases that arise when training patient-facing LLMs on local medical dialogues from resource-limited settings[26](/articles/s41591-025-04176-7#ref-CR26 "Clusmann, J. et al. The future landscape of large langÿuage models in medicine. Commun. Med. 3, 141 (2023)."),[27](/articles/s41591-025-04176-7#ref-CR27 "Hager, P. et al. Evaluation and mitigation of the limitations of large language models in clinical decision-making. Nat. Med. 30, 2613–2622 (2024)."), and establishing real-world evidence of their clinical utility within time-pressured hospital workflows[28](#ref-CR28 "Topol, E. J. High-performance medicine: the convergence of human and artificial intelligence. Nat. Med. 25, 44–56 (2019)."),[29](#ref-CR29 "Bedi, S. et al.

Lancet Digit. Health 6, e367–e373 (2024)."). While localized dialogues have enabled specialized applications, from patient-nurse interactions[32](/articles/s41591-025-04176-7#ref-CR32 "Wan, P. et al. Outpatient reception via collaboration between nurses and a large language model: a randomized controlled trial. Nat. Med. 30, 2878–2885 (2024).") and mental health support[33](/articles/s41591-025-04176-7#ref-CR33 "Obadinma, S. et al. The FAIIR conversational AI agent assistant for youth mental health service provision. NPJ Digit.

ChatDoctor: a medical chat model fine-tuned on a large language model Meta-AI (LLaMA) using medical domain knowledge. Cureus 15, e40895 (2023)."), their direct use in resource-limited clinical environments risks replicating existing care deficits. Consequently, a shift toward simulated dialogues curated from standardized medical corpora is underway, moving beyond a reliance on raw local data[23](/articles/s41591-025-04176-7#ref-CR23 "Tu, T. et al. Towards conversational diagnostic artificial intelligence. Nat. Med. 642, 442–450 (2025)."),[35](/articles/s41591-025-04176-7#ref-CR35 "McDuff, D. et al. Towards accurate differential diagnosis with large language models. Nat. Med. 642, 451–457 (2025)."). Yet, the relative utility of co-design versus passive data collecting for meeting clinical needs remains unknown. This omission begs a central question: should LLMs reflect local practices or help reform them? The answer is critical for global health equity, as passively collected local dialogues may codify and even scale systemic inequities, from diagnostic shortcuts to sociocultural biases[26](/articles/s41591-025-04176-7#ref-CR26 "Clusmann, J. et al. The future landscape of large langÿuage models in medicine. Commun. Med. 3, 141 (2023)."),[27](/articles/s41591-025-04176-7#ref-CR27 "Hager, P. et al. Evaluation and mitigation of the limitations of large language models in clinical decision-making. Nat. Med. 30, 2613–2622 (2024).").

To bridge the gap between the potential of LLMs and their practical impact in resource-limited settings, we developed PreA (Pre-Assessment), an LLM chatbot (OpenAI; GPT-4.0 mini) for primary-to-specialist care transitions, using a multistakeholder participatory co-design approach[36](/articles/s41591-025-04176-7#ref-CR36 "Li, S. et al. A community co-designed LLM-powered chatbot for primary care: a randomized controlled trial. Nat. Health 
                https://doi.org/10.1038/s44360-025-00021-w
                
               (2025)."). We engaged diverse community and clinical stakeholders, including patients, care partners, community health workers, physicians, nurses and hospital administrators, to shape a tool that addresses real-world clinical and accessibility needs. The final PreA chatbot integrated a patient-facing chatbot with low-literacy accessibility features and a clinical interface that generates specialist referrals and supports evidence-based decision-making under time constraints (Extended Data Fig. [1](/articles/s41591-025-04176-7#Fig5)).

The decision to deploy this co-designed version of PreA was empirically grounded, informed by a previous simulated experiment that directly compared the co-design approach with additionally fine-tuning the same mode
