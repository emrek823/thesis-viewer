### Mango Fund Expansion - Investment Execution

- Counter-signed term sheet received for bio investment
- Jason at MOFO meeting in 15-20 minutes to finalize legal docs
- Wire timing strategy:
	- Core fund: End of week or early next week
	- Mango fund: Following week (using as leverage for quicker setup)
- Equal split structure between Core and Mango funds
	- ~70/30 or 65/35 breakdown (Core/Mango)
	- Pro rata allocation going forward only
- SPV signature blocks expected, similar to previous deals

### Fund Structure & Operations Setup

- Mango LPA drafting in progress
	- Carbon copy of V2 LPA with minimal tailoring
	- Side letter language being refined (expansion fund vs parallel fund distinction)
- Financial consolidation approach:
	- Single consolidated audit preferred
	- Combined financial statements likely
	- Track separate allocations for new investments only
- New bank account creation pending counter-signatures
- Capital call logistics:
	- $1.4M available in fund
	- Line of credit accessible if needed
	- Potential amounts: $1.8M Core, $619K Mango

### Budget & Team Adjustments

- Proposed Mango budget mirrors current structure plus $625K
- Personnel changes:
	- Emre: $400K → $520K (not yet communicated)
	- New investor role: $250K carved out (TBD on hire and final amount)
	- Sean’s compensation increase planned but unchanged for now
- Travel expenses for LP events (Tampa General, Vanderbilt) to be allocated appropriately

### Administrative Improvements

- Switch from Amex to Ramp for expense management
	- Dave to have direct access for monthly reconciliation
	- Eliminate back-and-forth with expense tracking
	- Implementation post-Mango close

### Due Diligence & Compliance Timeline

- Focus sequence: Legal DD first, then operational DD
- Mango’s understanding: Current policies acceptable, gaps addressable
- Potential policy purchases ($15K range) if DD identifies critical needs
- Positions fund better for Fund 3 preparation
- MOFO handling compliance requirements
