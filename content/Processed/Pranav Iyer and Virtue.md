### Company Status & Pivot

- Moved away from standard biomarker testing business model
	- Previous model: $50 profit on $300 biomarker test, no economies of scale
	- Tested comprehensive Quest test with ~24 people
	- Realized wasn’t sustainable business without software differentiation
- Current focus: at-home multi-omic testing
	- Proteomics as starting point, adding metabolomics and lipidomics
	- Planning verticalization with untargeted mass spec device
	- Working with researcher at Harvard/Boston Children’s
	- Strong data on capillary blood collection vs fingerprick (lower nerve density)

### Go-to-Market Strategy

- Primary channels through longevity clinics and CCRCs (Continuous Care Retirement Communities)
	- Signed first $1M ARR deal with Dr. Khan (runs 4 clinics globally)
	- Dr. Khan has distribution to 300 other clinics plus peptide company
	- CCRC pilot with 4,000 elderly patients, targeting 3-5 year contracts
- Current offering: organ clocks at $500 price point (50% margins)
	- Using UK Biobank data for interpretation engine (50,000 people longitudinally)
	- Hazard ratio of 3.1 for Alzheimer’s prediction
	- Replaces $5,000 proteomics tests from competitors like SemiScan
	- Provides efficacy measurement for $10-20K stem cell therapies
- Future consumer play: “1,000 biomarkers at home” positioning vs competitors’ 150 biomarkers

### Technical & Business Model Development

- AI/ML foundation model approach
	- Graph transformer with protein embeddings representing biological pathways
	- Mechanistic model of biology vs simple ML risk scores
	- Infrastructure setup for knowledge graphs and relational tables
- Data acquisition strategy
	- Willing to purchase clinic data for specific disease types
	- UK Biobank provides general population coverage
	- Longevity clinics offer autoimmune/inflammatory disease data
	- CCRC patients will develop comorbidities over time
- Pharma monetization roadmap
	- Initial specialty focus likely autoimmune (>50% of panel is inflammatory/immune markers)

### Funding & Next Steps

- Raising $4-6M round (pushed from December to January for better terms)
- Target investor types:
- Key hiring priorities: clinical diagnostics expert from Tempest/Flatiron/Path AI background
- Immediate milestones:
	- Expand CCRC pilot to full 4,000 patients
	- Scale longevity clinics from 4 to 20 to 100
	- Dr. Khan’s Joe Rogan podcast tour this summer for proteomics awareness
