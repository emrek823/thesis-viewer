## Summary
The Tegus Client speaks with the Vice President of Human Resources at Logicalis Inc about their views and experience with point solutions, as well as their medical benefits and use of vendors Livongo, Omada, and SWORD. The VP explains that Logicalis is a global IT solution provider with a focus on comprehensive benefits that balance cost with employee perception and market standards. They use Livongo and Omada for diabetes management, Wisdom Share for behavioral health, and Workit for addiction and other behavioral health issues. The company relies heavily on MMA for managing their benefits vendors and uses a data mining company to analyze their benefits data objectively. The VP prefers to evaluate each solution individually to ensure they are fully effective and expresses a strong trust in MMA's recommendations and research.

## Expert Details
* Current Vice President, Human Resources at Logicalis Inc (owned by Datatec), a customer of SWORD Health
* The expert can speak to why they chose to select SWORD over other point solutions in the space.
* Current Vice President, Human Resources at Logicalis Inc (owned by Datatec), a customer of SWORD Health.
* The expert has been with Logicalis Inc for the last 18 years and is the Head HR officer in the US, with over 750 employees. The expert serves as the primary person responsible for making decisions relative to benefit plans and works alongside the Benefits Committee and champions all benefits-related activities, including evaluating and analyzing various vendors. They were one of the decision-makers to implement SWORD Health at Logicalis and started using their services in January 2021. The expert can speak to why they chose to select SWORD over other vendors in the space.

**Q: Are you a current customer or have you evaluated any of the listed companies?**

**A:** We signed an agreement with SWORD Health and will start using their services in Jan 2020.

**Q: Can you speak to some of the strengths/weaknesses of each? Please elaborate.**

**A:** Yes, I can do this. We found a lot of solutions in space were similar in terms of their approach, but SWORD was totally digital, and their interface with PT staff was all online. SWORD was more tech-savvy vs. other vendors we looked at.

**Tegus Client**
Hello, thank you for speaking with me today. The highest-level description of what I'm hoping to talk about is your views and experience with point solutions and how you manage them and your interest in them and how that might change going forward.

**Vice President of Human Resources at Logicalis Inc**
And what's your definition of point solutions?

**Tegus Client**
Good question. So to give a definition by example, I'd point to Livongo as one of the top-of-mind company. So, a clinical program that is third party, either hire directly via the employer, the plan sponsor or via some additional third-party that could help manage them.

If you wanted to, technically, we could even include things like your telehealth provider, although more top of mind from my perspective is more of those clinical programs. So, to get started, so I have some context for your perspective. Can you tell me the size of your company and maybe even a little bit about the culture you have when it comes to benefits?

**Vice President of Human Resources at Logicalis Inc**
So Logicalis is a global company, but we just deal with the U.S. In the U.S., there's about 700 employees and about 600 of those 700 are on our medical plans. While we have 20-plus offices, they're spread out throughout the U.S. from coast to coast and north to south. We do have a predominance of people in the Midwest.

**Tegus Client**
Okay. And industry-wise, how would you categorize?

**Vice President of Human Resources at Logicalis Inc**
So we're an information technology solution provider. We partner with IBM, HP, Cisco, Microsoft, being the Tier one players. And we sell their hardware and software solutions to what we consider mid-market, $500 million or so in revenue is what our sweet spot is.

We also sell a lot into health care. So health care systems as well as educational institutions, we have products and services that support the introduction and/or upgrade of communications networks in school systems.

So it's between the non-health care, non-educational, it's probably one-third, one-third and one-third. Our gross revenue is around $600 million a year. That stayed that way steady for the last couple of years. And net, I think, is about $450 million.

**Tegus Client**
Okay. No, it's an imperfect categorization. But when you think of the personnel, what do you think of your employees, what's the breakout, white collar, blue collar?

**Vice President of Human Resources at Logicalis Inc**
About 75% white collar, 25% blue collar.

**Tegus Client**
Okay, so that is all super helpful to kind of help me understand the company. Tell me a little bit about your role in benefits provision and kind of the culture of are you trying to be top in the class when it comes to benefits? Are you trying to match the market and what the goal is?

**Vice President of Human Resources at Logicalis Inc**
So I'm the VP of Human Resources. I've been here for almost 20 years. I've watched the company grow from nothing, for all intents and purposes, to where we are now. The average age in the organization is 45, and it stayed that way for many years.

And the reason is, is that who we hire in the organization are, for all intents and purposes, people who, on the white-collar side, people who have been out for 10, 15 years in the field. A lot of our people will come from our partners, because they want to go to the other side of the ledger and don't want to work for this huge company that has hundreds of thousands of people, and they'd rather be a bigger fish in a smaller pond.

And that happens a lot. We also lose people the other way. But the average age of 45, that does take into consideration they maybe 120 of those 700 people are in their 20s. So if we didn't have the blue-collar people, which, by the way, is made up of call center people, right? They're people right out of school, first job. Up until recently, they were only making $15 an hour, and now they're making maybe $20.

So we've got this dichotomy because you've got the older part of the workforce that are, what you would imagine, are more concerned about benefits. And the younger people believe they don't have to go to a doctor, especially the males.

And they don't need insurances. What's all that stuff? Why would I need such protection? So they haven't had any events yet in their lives where they're on their own, where they just got a $10,000 medical bill.

So the white-collar people are much more appreciative of the benefits we provide. And for all intents and purposes, we gear the benefit programs around them because we know they're going to be the users of them.

**Tegus Client**
Okay. That makes sense. So to lay the ground a little bit more, you're self-insured, I assume. Do you work with one or more carriers?

**Vice President of Human Resources at Logicalis Inc**
We have one carrier for each one of our benefit plans. So Blue Cross Blue Shield is medical, Delta Dental is dental, VSP is vision and then Cigna for our disability and life.

**Tegus Client**
Okay. When you're thinking about benefit design and focusing in on medical here, there's a lot of different motivators that you could keep top of mind when you're doing your benefits. And I have five I'm going to read off, but then we can discuss them however it applies.

A is cost control for high-dollar population, B is talent retention, C is employee perception, D is meeting market standard benefits and E is health equity. When you're designing the medical plan and deciding how you're going to approach it, is it all about cost? Is it about attracting and retaining employees? What are your main goals?

**Vice President of Human Resources at Logicalis Inc**
Well, our main goal years ago was to be able to attract and retain. And at that time, we didn't have really competitive programs. And so over the course of the year, as we have created that, our benefits are viewed by applicants and new hires alike that it's very comprehensive. And we provide people with really probably more than a lot of companies our size do. The cost is always there. And we've had some years in the last 10 that we've had very little cost creep and increases, which was great.

And then we have had other years where we've been slammed by very sick people. And with a group our size, which was about 600 employees who were enrolled, roughly that equates to about 1,500 members. All you need is three or four of those exceeding $1 million, and you've got yourself in a little bit of a pickle. Even though we have stop-loss insurance, so we're protected. But we had a year like that a couple of years ago, and it wakes you up because you can't control it, right?

I mean self-insured, you're paying what you're going to incur. So we try to balance the overall cost there when we've had bad years. We haven't necessarily passed it all on to the members. We keep the market in mind, which was one of your criteria. And you asked the question, do we provide benefits above the market, at the market or below the market? We try to stay at the market. So for example, with the cost, the market tells us the employer picks up about 75% of medical and the employee 25%, and that's our North Star.

That's where we shoot for. Up to now, we've always been above that in terms of what we contribute. We still haven't gotten to the 75%, 25%. So we're usually at 77%, 76%, 78% picked up by the company. And we never want to go below that because in our heads, we want to be able to tell people truthfully that we're providing you benefits that are at or above market.

**Tegus Client**
Okay, perfect. When you think about how benefits are changing in the last couple of years and then looking forward in the near term, do you feel like the benefits are becoming more comprehensive? Or do you feel like it's maintaining? And again, focused on medical fund.

**Vice President of Human Resources at Logicalis Inc**
Yes. I mean medical, I mean that whole arena is changing, on one hand, rapidly; on the other hand, slowly, depending upon how you look at it. I spent 25 years in the health care industry in HR. So I've run health care plans from the provider side as well as the employer simultaneously, which is a very interesting dynamic because you really don't know who you're supposed to be, who your customer is.

When centers of excellence in health care first came out, and that was the big thing and all right. And everyone was going to migrate to this, and you were going to go to the Mayos and the Johns Hopkins and the Cleveland Clinics of the world an MD Anderson, etc. And that's not practical.

I mean it's okay for national companies, we have footprint throughout the United States. It's not practical from the standpoint of a smaller company. We're not going to get into a center of excellence or some type of other concept like that. Let's say we have somebody that's in Detroit that needs a heart transplant. We're not sending them elsewhere in the United States for that. There's quality health care in Detroit for heart.

Now if the person wants to go there, okay, fine. We have PPOs, but you could be out of network. If you want to pay 60% of the cost of open-heart surgery, okay. So, my point is that we, with the size of our group and where we have our people, we know that there's quality health care in all of those geos, whether it's Detroit or any other major city.

And therefore, we don't think that going to that new age view of actually going to a top name medical institution would be right for us. I get for big companies, the GMs of the world and the IBMs of the world and that, okay, that probably makes sense based upon the scale that they have.

So my point is, is that we're fine with the health care that's provided through the Blue Cross Blue Shield network. I don't know if you're familiar with GeoAccess, but it's something that I grew up with many, many years ago, and it's practically my bible.

If my GeoAccess is 97%, 98% and I've got good health scores from those networks and those providers, then I'm doing as good as I'm ever going to do. And I've been in situations where companies I work for wanted to go in a different direction with a different model. And I'm the one who basically is the negative nanny and basically say, what are you going to get? Are you going to get an extra percent out of that? What's it going to get you?

And you potentially disrupt the network because you think this other network is going to be nirvana. No, it's not. There's no network that's a nirvana. And by the way, you're not even talking to your employees who are the ones who are actually going to get the care. They don't want to go far, far away. They want to stay close to home where their family and their support system is.

I think there's some sexy stuff that's out there. And every time somebody comes to me or our benefit broker tries to float this, hey, we can save you such, 15% on your $9 million health care bill, I'm going, yes, no, I don't think you can.

**Tegus Client**
Okay. So you use Blue Cross and you run PPO plans?

**Vice President of Human Resources at Logicalis Inc**
Yes.

**Tegus Client**
Do you use Blue Cross for any buy-ups, whether it's for higher-tier case management or clinical programs, anything like that?

**Vice President of Human Resources at Logicalis Inc**
We have a couple of programs that pack out or add-ons with them. I mean affiliated with them since I started my career 40-plus years ago, and they're good in a lot of ways just due to size and scale and everything. But their care management, their utilization management side of the business has never been something that I've been quite excited about.

It's more window dressing than anything. And the data that we've ever gotten or when we've tried to target certain health population groups it's not been convincing that, okay, if we go a little bit deeper here, we're going to get something better. And that's why we, in the last couple of years, we put in Omada and Livongo.

You look at those programs, and those programs are very welcoming and embracing and they're not the old-age clinical management programs that kind of felt like you were going to scare the stuff out of your patient population.

This is all about how to behaviorally condition or it could change the behavior of people over time with some very positive approaches and tools and resources. And we use a company for what I'll call data mining in the last couple of years. We started with them about three or four years ago. And we give them all of our medical, dental, vision data, all of our wellness data, all of our EAP data.

We have wellness data, everything, and we let them take it through their algorithms and they send back to us, okay, here's the health of Logicalis. And that's incredibly descriptive and very helpful to us. And the reason I'm describing it to you is because they came back and they just said, folks, you put in Livongo and Omada and your uptake and your early term results are fabulous for a group your size.

And all we have to tell you is you keep with it, keep advertising it. And over the course of time, you're going to see some demonstrable positive changes, certainly with the cost being not as high as it could be and the outcomes, the clinical outcomes being positive, too. Our people love them.

And same thing with SWORD for their digital PT. I mean I've been in this industry a long time. And in HR, and I had to be convinced that having physical therapy at home by putting sensors around your body and having it hooked up to an iPad and talking to an avatar was going to be seen by people as anything but silly.

And boy, was I wrong. People love it. And it was actually a natural for our people and we implemented it right when COVID happened. So that was a stroke of genius on my part, right? Oh yes, I know COVID is coming, so I'm going to implement digital PT, seeing as all the clinics are going to be shut down, right?

But our people love it. They could do it in their home. They could do it in the hotel. If they're traveling, they could do it on vacation. And versus the traditional I got to get up at 6:30 in the morning to drive to a physical therapy clinic and be one of four patients who has been manipulated for the next 45 minutes.

And now I could do that at home and it's much more flexible and it's on my time, not on some clinic's time that they can only fit me in at 6:30 in the morning or 7:30 at night, right? So we've just had great luck with these programs. And our people, they appreciate it. And we haven't had any nightmares at all with any of them.

**Tegus Client**
So it sounded like some of the motivation to start looking at these solutions was because the clinical programs through the TPA weren't impactful. And well, first, is that a fair assessment?

**Vice President of Human Resources at Logicalis Inc**
Yeswell, in our numbers, we were concerned about our diabetes numbers. We are concerned about our MSK numbers for our population. So all of our decisions relative to benefit programs with medical, specifically, are all driven off of getting those clinical results as to what the health of our population is. And they give us recommendations as to what we could do. And we follow up on those each time.

And to me, it makes total sense because like, all right, I'm not doing this just because it's the coolest program that just came out. I'm doing this because we have a problem. We have people who are unhealthy in a particular way, and we want to positively impact both their health through the behavioral changes, but also be able to impact the financial side of it over the course of time and be able to keep the health care cost down as much as we possibly can.

**Tegus Client**
I think I missed one small thing. You said that they recommended, we take a look at it. Who was they?

**Vice President of Human Resources at Logicalis Inc**
Yes, it's PATH is the name of the company. We got introduced to them through our benefit broker. We use MMA, Marsh McLennan. And they introduced us to them three or four years ago, and it's just been that I rely upon that information greatly. And every year, it's probably the most anticipated meeting from a benefits perspective that I look forward to because it's going to tell me the good and the bad and the ugly.

The other thing it did, and this is pre-COVID, it identified that we had a significant problem with mental health, with behavioral health issues. And interestingly enough, it was where we were having the majority of that problem pre-COVID. It was with our younger people going through a lot of issues and stress in their lives. And unfortunately, people doing overdoses with the opioids or trying to commit suicide. And sometimes it was dependents of our employees. And other times, it was our employees.

But the point was that, that PATH report identified that as well. And so before COVID hit, we had plans to put in place more mental health support to our employees and their families. And we put those plans in place. And again, it was just a stroke of genius, not really. They all took effect like two months before COVID hits.

So we had that stuff in place. They were new, but they were in place. And all we had to do is steer people to them versus, oh my god, now we got to rush to get something in place. We had it in place. All we had to do is be able to get them to understand it's there for you. And now we have this comprehensive set of mental health resources that people can access.

And so for all intents and purposes, we have addressed the top three medical issues that our employees and their dependents have. And from my perspective, it stayed the course. Do this until we see something else pop up that's different than what we're seeing because if you put the overall cost of those three categories, diabetes, MSK and behavioral health together in one bucket, that's outside of cancer and cardiology, I mean that's it, that's the majority of our cost.

**Tegus Client**
Okay. This is all really helpful, but I want to back up just to that one point earlier, which was the programs through the TPA specifically weren't quite up to snuff. But you said you're still upgrading with them, and you have to do a couple of buy-ups. So what do you currently buy up for them with even though you have all these other programs?

**Vice President of Human Resources at Logicalis Inc**
So trying to think of this past year, we've been looking at blocking. So the programs we've actually put in have been not as much on the medical side as far as the clinical management as it's been on the prescription side.

And as everyone going through specialty, prescriptions are just crazy in terms of their cost. And ours, by the way, our experience this last couple of years is half of our prescription cost is coming now from specialty.

We track it every month. And on one hand, it's very interesting. On the other hand, it freaks the hell out of me that there's one dose for $38,000. And how often is that going to be? Well, typically, those are like quarterly.

But you just have so many variations on these drugs, whether it's an injection or it's a pill or some other therapy, and you see all the derivatives of them. We've put in clinical management specialty specifically that no, we don't want to deny our members access to the stuff that could end up being life-saving. But we believe it should go through some type of a filter.

RxBenefits runs out of MMA. And we use their platform in terms of utilization management for the pharmacy because we don't use the Blues for pharmacy. We use Express Scripts. We carved it out, and we carved it out years ago.

And every year, we actually ask the question again, so should we go back to the Blues pharmacy? And the numbers never work that there. You could say, all right, it's convenient, just go have one vendor instead of two and say, well, hell, I mean you're talking about $0.5 million in difference in cost. I'm sorry, I can't argue that one to the CEO. I want to spend $0.5 million more because I want to have one less vendor. Well, all right, there you go.

So we think that there's more advantage. Even though it's understood that the prescription cost is one-fourth of overall costs for our medical plan, we think we have the greatest chance of impacting that, especially with the specialty drugs. And so that's where we put our focus is to have much more utilization management per se in that area. And we know we're going to be disruptive with our employees. They are our workforce.

You were saying at the beginning, you want to know about the culture. The culture of our company is one where they do trust us. And they do think we care, but they don't want us in their business. And they don't want us in their personal lives. And I'm, obviously, I'm running into that right now with asking people to upload their COVID vaccine cards. And most people are fine with it. And then the other folks say, get out of my life. Leave me alone, none of your business.

So, whenever we do the utilization management changes, we're very thoughtful about them, I think, because there can be five different levels of that intervention, right? And we look at them every year. It's kind of like, all right, do we have the stomach to do this year that we didn't have last year? And then when you hear what it means and how many people would be challenged in terms of what they're getting, we usually err on the side of caution.

So when you said we get it for as much cost savings as possible, no, we're not because we don't want to piss off a bunch of people. And so we put in the things that we think are reasonable and that are going to get us what we think is a reasonable return. For example, I mean, if something is going to get us, we're going to piss off 100 people to get $2,000, we're not doing it.

There's no way. But if you can get $50,000, if you get $100,000, then, okay, then it might be worth it. And the bottom line when we're doing that, we're never going to keep people from anything that they truly need. If it's medically required and necessary, then they're going to get. We just want to make sure that if there's a cheaper, more equally effective regimen that they're going to that first. And so far, it's been okay.

**Tegus Client**
Okay. So I'm going to get a little more targeted now. So first, you identified 3 specific point solution vendors, Livongo, Omada and SWORD. Are you using both Livongo and Omada for diabetes?

**Vice President of Human Resources at Logicalis Inc**
Yes.

**Tegus Client**
Okay. Why both of them?

**Vice President of Human Resources at Logicalis Inc**
Well, because we had an identified number of people who are diabetics who weren't necessarily doing a very good job of managing it. And then what scared the hell out of us is that we had a bunch of people who were on the edge, and they were about to go over.

**Tegus Client**
So do they have complementary offerings then?

**Vice President of Human Resources at Logicalis Inc**
They do. And the cool thing is that you don't automatically just get put into the program, you actually have to meet certain criteria.

**Tegus Client**
Okay.

**Vice President of Human Resources at Logicalis Inc**
Clinical criteria. And some people are not accepted. And we've had a good track record on people who have started either one of these programs who have stayed with it. And we're seeing decreases in the clinical parameters or increases, depending upon which what you're looking at, as to people who are doing things to that should lead to positive outcomes for them and for their health there. So it's still early, still early. I mean we're just finishing up our second year with both of those, but the early returns are very positive.

**Tegus Client**
Okay. And SWORD, of course, for the MSK side. And then what kind of approach are you doing for behavioral health? Is that something to do with a point solution? Or is that something else?

**Vice President of Human Resources at Logicalis Inc**
No. It is something else. I learned a long time ago when I was in the health care industry, don't try to tell an employee where they get their mental health. It's the same thing, don't tell a woman which gynecologist she chooses, okay? I think early out of my career, I was that naive male who said, yes, let's just change your network. Yes, okay, especially in a hospital system with 85% women, that's not a good thing. So I got told in no uncertain terms, don't do this.

So I've kept that in my mind all my years. And in terms of mental health, we give people access to resources. And we advertise them, and we provide them with education about the different resources. For example, we use Wisdom Share, which is an online platform that has a lot of behavioral health tools in it, but much of it has to do with meditation.

And very short spurts of where people can go in and use this platform on their phone and wherever they are, so it's very user-friendly from that perspective. We've had an employee systems program for years. And of course, employee systems programs started based upon alcohol and drug abuse, but now are much more than that.

And so we started a program. We had a partnership with a company called Workit, which is an addiction provider. So whether it be, yes, alcohol and drugs are covered under that, but also gambling, obesity, family issues, domestic violence, all of that stuff is covered. And the company pays for it. I mean the company pays for Livongo, the company pays for Omada, the company pays for SWORD, the company pays for the behavioral health through Wisdom Share and Workit.

And we have a wellness platform. We use Sonic Boom, and that's kind of the place where we house all of this. We have webinars that the whole organization can have access to. We have a very, very fluid communication strategy in the company where, in fact, people will complain to us, you have to stop communicating to us now because there's too much. I don't mind having that criticism, by the way.

I mean our approach and when I say to people on our quarterly all-hands calls all the time is that my job is to make you aware of what's out there for you to choose from depending upon what situation you are in the med stuff.

If I pick and choose, how do I know whether you have a mental health issue right now? I don't, I never will. I don't want to know it. But I have to make sure that you know these resources are out there. So I'm not going to apologize for being in your face all the time.

**Tegus Client**
I'm going to refocus this a little bit, just keeping an eye on the clock and my questions I have left. When you're looking at the decision to bring on these point solutions, obviously, the recommendation of PATH weighed in as well as the expectation of improving health for a high-cost area. But when you were looking at the individual vendors, what were the key decision criteria? Was it price? Was it ROI? What appealed to you?

**Vice President of Human Resources at Logicalis Inc**
So our MMA does all of that for us and may give us both a pretty comprehensive analysis when we're looking at it. And again, it is not all price. It is what we think would be the best fit for our particular circumstances. And I get it, there's lots of companies that are in one building in one location, and they do it all live, right? Well, we're the exact opposite. We don't do anything live. We do everything through Webex and Zoom.

And it's all digital. So my point in saying that to you is that when we look at vendors, anybody who's using paper and they want to have enrollment meetings in your cafeteria, no, isn't going to work. So they're immediately dismissed, right, because it's not a fit for how our employment model is.

**Tegus Client**
No, is MMA looking across vendors? Or does MMA have particular partners that they recommend?

**Vice President of Human Resources at Logicalis Inc**
MMA looks across. They openly will tell us which ones they've had done the most work with, but it doesn't mean that's the universe. And so they give us a pretty broad range of vendors to look at. And we just did yesterday, we just reviewed our stop loss for our medical. And we have a carve-out with Sun Life on that. But every year, MMA does an RFP for our stop loss, and they come back with five different alternatives to Sun Life. And two or three of those five, were not even in their book of business.

So they're aware of ones that might be emerging and others that might be leaving a particular niche, but we rely upon them to set the criteria as to what we're going to look at, and then they review it with us. And then I take it forward from my position. And if I feel comfortable with it and we've vetted it, then I bring it to the Executive Committee for their consideration.

**Tegus Client**
Okay. And like you're getting the recommendation from MMA, they're telling you that they've used the vendor in the past, are you then going to any of your colleagues in the industry as well or any other kind of tools or networks to that effect?

**Vice President of Human Resources at Logicalis Inc**
No, we really depend upon MMA to do that. And the MMA part that we actually started as a boutique benefit broker in the Detroit metropolitan area that the world buy MMA. And it says their model, before they became MMA, rival any of the national, international benefit consulting firms. And I dealt with all of them in my prior life. And they're all fine. But this little benefit broker in southeast of Michigan, they knew what to do. They just do their stuff. And so whenever I get approached by other large companies, I go, yes, no, I'm not interested.

**Tegus Client**
So does MMA get involved in the management of the point solutions? Or do you contract directly with them?

Basically, because I just have a one FTE benefits administrator on my payroll. And so when it comes to interacting with all of our benefits vendors, MMA actually does that for us. My benefits administrator, that's on my payroll, interacts with the benefit providers directly, but they do it as a team, and the MMA staff actually run interference for us. And whenever we have any particular issues from a program perspective, they follow up on our behalf, which is wonderful.

And Life, for example, for a stop loss, so MMA has the centers of excellence that they run their stop loss through. And there, it's them driving, more than supporting. We're just gaining the advantage of MMA's size in terms of negotiation. Same thing with RxBenefits, we gain the advantage of the MMA relationship and how they're built, and that turns into savings for us.

**Tegus Client**
That makes sense. And so again, focused on the point solution, so MMA is integral in the day-to-day management of those, it sounds like. Do you have any questions or concerns in having that structure? Or do you feel like having your broker centralize that management role, do you think that's optimal? I haven't talked to anybody who's had this approach, so I'm curious.

**Vice President of Human Resources at Logicalis Inc**
No, it is optimal for us because I don't have the staff to do it internally. Nor given I have experience with it in my prior life, nor do I want to.

**Tegus Client**
And I think everybody is open to your situation of having a third party do that role that I've talked to, but I hadn't talked to anyone who's actually doing it, so that's interesting. I'm overlooking somebody. Somebody is using their TPA for some of their buy-ups. So it's like an internal buy-up with their TPA, so in your case, the Blue Cross would be managing those relationships.

**Vice President of Human Resources at Logicalis Inc**
Yes.

**Tegus Client**
I'm curious, are you more comfortable? Or do you think it'd be the same level of comfort? Just compare and contrast, which one makes sense? I mean you obviously have a great relationship with MMA, but how would you feel if it came through your TPA?

**Vice President of Human Resources at Logicalis Inc**
I'm more comfortable with what I have because I don't have any impure other than the fact that's up per se, but my feeling is that I have never necessarily trusted TPAs.

**Tegus Client**
Okay. That's interesting. I think the one point where I think it makes sense is that they are integrated with their eligibility files then. So, the targeting is easier, but it sounds like you have a pretty good grasp of all your claims anyways.

**Vice President of Human Resources at Logicalis Inc**
Yes, I think the fact that we have this data mining company that is able to take data for many stores and then upload it into their algorithms and spit out, I think it's less of a concern for me. If I didn't have that, it might be a greater concern because then, where am I going to have the analysis? Who's going to do the analysis?

But I actually feel so strongly about having this data mining company to be more of a cause and effect for us than something coming from the Blues or Delta Dental, they're not bad people, I'm not saying that. It's just the data mining company is totally objective. MMA is more objective than the PPA is. So I guess it's a feeling of comfort as am I getting honest, candid, forthright feedback, good, better and different, and that I can feel comfortable about making decisions around.

**Tegus Client**
Yes. And I'm not familiar with MMA's approach. I know when you get into some of the big consultancies, sometimes there is a financial relationship with some of the point solutions. It sounds like with MMA, that is not the case, and they'll look across the board.

**Vice President of Human Resources at Logicalis Inc**
Yes. I know they have financial relationships. But I never get the feeling like it's the answer is always coming back to this one. And they don't approach it that way. And hey, I'm not that naive to believe that they're sitting in their war room before they come and do a presentation and go, we're going to get them to go with C. I mean I got it. I understand.

And in fact, you know what the interesting thing is when I press MMA for their view, their recommendation, they're not really comfortable with that. They're not as forthcoming and I test all my vendors or brokers. I mean for a 401(k), it's the same thing. It said, well, what would you guys do? And they give me the song and dance well in our plan where you pay us to give you advice.

And it's all right, well, give me some advice. Tell me which one to go with. And I always put them on a spot. And I know it's unfair. But hey, look, you guys do this is your life. So, we're just one client, and you've got 100 of them. And I always ask both the brokers, I just say, what's your book of business? Where would they go? You have other people who have tried this before. One thing I don't like to be, I don't want to be beta on anything.

Somebody comes out I'll get communicated with on a frequent basis from all these different vendors that we got this new thing. And I'll send it to MMA. And I'll just say, okay, have you ever heard of these guys before? And maybe they did, maybe they didn't. But I said, well, if you have time to do some investigation, I'll let them tell me whether it's real that they're talking about? Or is it just mirrors?

And a lot of times, they'll come back to me and they'll just tell me, they're too new, this concept certainly, it has some validity, but it hasn't been fleshed out. And they're talking small groups. They're talking targeted geos.

**Tegus Client**
I've seen a couple of different models for point solutions being aggregated. And I know you said you have Sonic Boom to kind of have it where there's a portal of sorts where you can go and have access to this to simplify things for your members, they can find all the programs.

But what would you think, whether it's MMA or whether it was your carrier, if they said, okay, here's the five programs that we have contracts set up for, maybe pay us a flat PEPM and your employees have access to all five of these? Have you ever seen anything like that?

**Vice President of Human Resources at Logicalis Inc**
No. I mean there have been companies who have been trying to do that years ago. I like to have the least number of vendor relationships I can. On the other side, it really doesn't matter if I have the least number if I don't have each one of the programs being what I feel will be fully effective.

So I'm torn on that. I mean there's an attraction to it. And if I were to be able to get some group rate that saved me a material amount of dollars, maybe. But I'd go in very cautiously with that because I've seen some of those that have not turned out well because that one group, vendor, broker, whatever, they weren't experts at all five.

And so three turned out fine and the other two didn't. Well, I want all five to do good. I don't want three out of five

**Tegus Client**
It sounds like if it was financially appealing that you'd take a closer look, but you'd prefer to look at things on a case by case.

**Vice President of Human Resources at Logicalis Inc**
Yes. They don't have to be material dollars.

**Tegus Client**
Okay. Now, if MMA, very quickly, and then I'll set you free, if MMA said, this is our one diabetes and where we recommend. This is our one MSK and you trust them to vet, is that kind of an in-between option? Or do you just like it with the individual evaluation where you're involved in the selection by each therapeutic area? Is that the preference?

**Vice President of Human Resources at Logicalis Inc**
No, I like it the way it is. They do the research, they put it in front of me, and then I ask them for advice and counsel, and I dig through it. I'm one of those crazy, crazy HR people who likes to go through RFPs.

**Tegus Client**
Yes. I've never heard of such a thing. Okay.

**Vice President of Human Resources at Logicalis Inc**
Yes. I got to feel good about the decision that I'm making on behalf of the company because it's my fiduciary responsibility to make that happen.

**Tegus Client**
Yes. Well, thank you so much. Have a great day. Goodbye.
