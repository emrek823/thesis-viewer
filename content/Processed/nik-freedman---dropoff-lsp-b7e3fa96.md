Dropoff

Dropoff background

We’re a logistics courier on demand delivery company. We have 1000s of contract drivers all over the country. Deliver for LabCorp, Red Cross. 60% healthcare. In my market (PA/NY/NY/MI) we’re doing 20 Marken deliveries / month

Most on demand - Red Cross asks us to deliver a shipment. They are 1099 drivers - we don’t have any control. The philly market is busy though so driver can do this full time and not have to drive Uber

How do you dispatch a driver?

Waitlist and be in 20 minutes of pickup location on Spring Garden. We get an order and they go through

How do you work with Marken?

They ping us and ask - can you do this in the next 2 hours?

Marken - drivers go through special training and TWIC cards to get into airports and they require drivers

Marken - their deliveries are complex. They need dry ice, ambient, cooler boxes. We’re instructing the driver along the way. A lot of paperwork along the way and they get paid well. Some of these drivers have whole fleets of trucks where they form these mini teams or groups.

Those are the drivers cashing out. $100k this year on driving

Last mile stuff they hand it off

Tomorrow a driver has to go to Dilsburg, collect specimen and take it to UPS and ship it to CA

The problem with the market and a lot of these companies and having a steady supply of drivers and doing this last minute. It’s crazy

Marken - $1m treatments. $3.5m CGT in the back of her Honda CRV

The delivery was flawless and that was life or death.

When the Marken lady came on site and congratulated us for that delivery - you could see all of our faces say “holy shit”. That lady was riding around with it in the back of her car. It is shocking

What is your differentiator?

We make logistics easy for these companies. They want to send us something and we get it done frankly.

Tech you use

CXT - logistics, HR for drivers, everything. https://cxtsoftware.com/distribution-logistics-software/?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiA9IC6BhA3EiwAsbltOMTXreifsOU4vsYnLZLy95v02clrc7xd4_6H4xBrepTSe2fr3ZqRrhoCB7IQAvD_BwE

Time stamp delivery. We pull data for each client, what on-time delivery % is. What’s the on-time delivery.Pulling .csv files and understanding the data is my job

Looking at our revenue and margins and seeing why things are changing. We had to pay a driver extra for a particular shipment for example and I use CXT.

Anything else?

We use a lot of temperature sensors. We have the alarm and it gets out of the temperature range. We had a delivery and the temp was supposed to 15-28 and the alarm went off. At that point, we pulled the box don’t deliver it and call Marken and get the OK to deliver

A to B shipments (no UPS or Airline) use CXT

Airway Builds and papers are sent to Marken and a lot of steps

ID Check forms

Have the airway bill - # that is associated with

Take pictures of the empty box, specimen in it. Take pictures and go to UPS

If you could have smart engineers run around and solve problems for you, where would you start?

ETAs. Drivers don’t always have their tracking on

Customer care side. When they send orders and just automating that whole email flow and coordination.
