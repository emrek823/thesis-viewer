### Team Background & Expertise

- Participants: Dat, Ishan, Akhil, Prajwal from Horus Health
- Pre-med students with clinical experience
	- Sean and team spent hundreds/thousands of hours shadowing nurses in clinical settings
	- Research background at Vanderbilt University Medical Department on tobacco cessation billing
	- Identified $3M revenue loss over 4 years from unbilled encounters (CPT 99406/99407)
- Prajwal’s background
	- Quantitative finance and engineering automation experience
	- Dad VP of IT at Wellstar - grew up seeing healthcare analytics perspective
	- Leading technical development of CDI platform

### Durability & Differentiation Strategy

- Three main pillars for competitive moat:
- Leveraging outside industry perspectives
	- User interface inspired by software engineering tools like Cursor (planned actions) and Perplexity (explainability)
	- Process improvement from quantitative finance background
	- 10-person advisory board including CDI department heads and former CMIOs

### Advisory Board & Customer Access

- Key advisors acquired through LinkedIn outreach:
	- Dr. Edna Nas: former CMIO St. Agnes Medical Center, ran CDI department
	- Mark Kessner: former physician, teaches CDI courses at universities
	- Current CDI specialist at UC Davis
- Advisory relationship structure
	- Cold outreach to CDI space influencers who teach coding/CDI courses
	- Interested in automation + education component for physicians
	- Help surface insights to reduce upstream query issues

### Current Pilot Programs

- University of Florida (UF)
	- Warm introduction through Penn Medicine VP of billing/compliance (Karen Smith) to Chief Compliance Officer Robert Mkowski
	- Went through full vendor procurement process (SOC2, AI governance, pen testing)
	- 6-month pilot with 4 users using copilot tool for regulatory/payer policies
	- Pushed 10+ features in 2 weeks based on user feedback
- Strategy: Using compliance/audit entry point to build relationship for future CDI platform deployment
- UF losing $20M annually, only using incumbents like 3M Solventum

### Product Architecture & Approach

- Technical differentiation:
	- Orchestration layer with sub-agents for record review
	- Consensus-based reasoning mechanism
	- Hierarchical code search through ICD/CPT decision trees (vs. searching all 160,000 codes)
	- Rule-based NLP first, then LLM contextual reasoning
- Benchmarking approach:
	- Using 3M gold standard dataset identifying missed codes in Mimic 3 ground truth
	- Optimizing for delta between gold standard and ground truth
	- Custom rule sets from advisory board for commonly missed codes

### CDI Workflow & User Experience

- Current workflow process:
- Query management:
	- 2-3 queries per case per physician on average
	- System highlights queryable opportunities automatically
	- Balance needed to avoid overburdening physicians (affects response rates)
- Voice interface exploration: Chat-based interface for CDI specialists working from home

### Go-to-Market Strategy & Monetization

- Primary ICP: Medium to large health systems for maximum revenue improvement
- Initial approach: Services/RCM partners for quicker sales cycles and product feedback
	- Staffing/consulting firms using Excel spreadsheets currently
	- Already have data warehouse setups and trusted customer relationships
	- Easier integration than direct EHR integration
- Target customers discussed:
	- American Healthcare Systems (Midwest) - 18 hospitals, understaffed CDI (1 person managing 2 hospitals)
	- MD Anderson (C-suite intro call scheduled)
	- Wellstar engagement ongoing
	- Vanderbilt University Medical Center
- System-level reporting opportunities: Hackensack Meridian CIO interested in tying CDI data to value-based care metrics and CMI risk adjustment scores

### Fundraising & Next Steps

- Current round: Raising $750K, open to $1M
- Key 12-month milestone: First full enterprise CDI deployment
	- Build case study showing ROI and revenue improvement
	- Gain production-level customer feedback
	- Demonstrate team delivery capabilities
	- Improve sales conversations for future raises
- Revenue target: $200-300K ARR to position for larger Series A
- Team consolidation: All founders moving to NYC full-time in 2026
- Reference requirements:
	- UF and Penn Medicine pilot contacts
	- 4-5 advisory board members
	- Individual references for each founder (2-3 each)
