1) Medical Records Request Automation and Revenue Realization

**Current state**
*   AFCOA receives frequent medical record requests from individuals, companies, and firms.
*   Fulfilling requests requires four techs who manually retrieve charts, take screenshots, and upload to a third-party vendor for external sharing.
*   AFCOA pays ~$250,000/year to a third party vendor, but the net is largely consumed by labor time from the four staff, resulting in limited realized margin from this workflow

**Key opportunity**
*   Automate end-to-end retrieval and fulfillment (request intake to delivery and audit trail).
*   Replace the third-party vendor with a HIPAA secure, in-house portal if feasible, to reduce revenue leakage and increase realized revenue.

**Expected outcomes**
*   Reduce FTE burden on records fulfillment; target 75-100% automation, ideally going down to 1 FTE instead of 4 or less to convert the $250,000 annual "gross" into higher "net realized" by cutting labor and platform fees.
*   Improved turnaround times and compliance posture via standardized, auditable workflows.
