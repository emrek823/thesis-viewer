# Chief Technology Officer (CTO)

**Location:** Remote (U.S.), Ideally EST
**Type:** Full-Time

## About You

You're a visionary technology leader who thrives at the intersection of AI innovation, full-stack engineering, and clinical trial transformation. You bring a deep understanding of modern software development, data-driven architectures, and the emerging frontier of AI agents and agentic frameworks.

You are equally comfortable setting strategic direction and rolling up your sleeves with engineering teams. You can architect scalable systems, guide integration of LLM-powered AI agents into production environments, and ensure all technology decisions are aligned with rigorous compliance requirements (HIPAA, GxP). More than just a technologist, you are a trusted partner to the executive team, able to balance long-term innovation with near-term business outcomes.

## What You'll Do: Set Technology Vision & Strategy

* Define and own the company's overall technology strategy across AI, data, engineering, and infrastructure.
* Build a forward-looking roadmap for LLM-powered AI agents and agentic architectures in clinical trial operations.
* Align technology initiatives with product, business, and regulatory goals.
* Stay ahead of industry trends in AI/ML, multimodal models, and full-stack innovation to position the company as a leader in clinical trial AI.

## Build & Scale Technology Platforms

* Oversee architecture and implementation of scalable, reliable, and secure platforms to support clinical AI products.
* Lead development of full-stack Java applications integrated with APIs, data warehouses, and AI services.
* Design frameworks for intelligent AI agents that interact seamlessly with users, data systems, and healthcare partners.
* Ensure infrastructure can handle enterprise-grade reliability, performance, and compliance requirements.

## Operational & People Leadership

* Build, mentor, and inspire engineering, AI research, and infrastructure teams across the organization.
* Establish best practices in software engineering, AI safety, DevOps, and MLOps.
* Foster a collaborative culture that bridges product, data science, engineering, and business needs.
* Balance rapid iteration with robust processes that ensure scalability and compliance.

## Drive Innovation & Clinical Impact

* Translate complex technology concepts into clear business narratives for leadership, partners, and customers.
* Partner with Pharma, CRO, and academic stakeholders to co-create breakthrough AI-driven clinical solutions.
* Champion the adoption of agentic AI systems that improve decision-making, patient matching, and trial site operations.
* Ensure all technology decisions accelerate trial efficiency, improve data integrity, and reduce time to market for life-saving therapies.

## What You Have (Required Qualifications)

* 10+ years in technology leadership roles (VP, Director, or CTO) with significant experience in AI/ML, SaaS platforms, and scalable system architectures.
* Proven expertise in full-stack development (Java, Spring, React/Angular, relational and non-relational data solutions).
* Experience deploying LLM-powered applications, AI agents, or agentic workflows into production environments.
* Track record of managing cross-functional engineering teams in healthcare, life sciences, or regulated industries.
* Strong grounding in data privacy, compliance (HIPAA, GxP), and security best practices.
* Excellent communication skills; able to interface with technical experts, executives, and external partners with equal fluency.
* Experience with vector databases, embeddings, or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
* Background in multi-agent AI frameworks (LangChain, AutoGen, OpenAI GPT Agents, or custom frameworks).
* Familiarity with clinical or biomedical data standards (CDISC, HL7/FHIR).
* Hands-on knowledge of cloud-native infrastructures (AWS/GCP/Azure) and container orchestration (Docker/K8s).
* Startup experience, ideally building and scaling engineering teams from the ground up.

## Why You'll Love It

You'll be at the forefront of transforming how clinical trials are conducted worldwide, directly contributing to bringing life-saving therapies to patients faster. Your data architecture and insights will power Ryght's AI platform that creates “AI Site Twins" of every clinical trial site globally, helping pharmaceutical companies identify the best research sites and streamline trial processes that traditionally take months into workflows that happen in days. This isn't just about building great data infrastructure—it's about being part of a mission where friction can disappear, drugs can be approved faster, and lives can be saved. Working with prestigious biotechs, pharma, CROs like QPS and Biorasi and academic medical centers like USC Keck School of Medicine and Emory University, you'll see your work scale across a network that's revolutionizing a $140 billion industry.

You'll work directly with founders, product leaders, and data experts to shape strategy, define company culture, and guide technical excellence. As a seed stage startup growing rapidly, this role offers significant influence, upside, and the chance to grow into one of the industry's most impactful technology leaders.
