## FDA wants to use more re­al-world da­ta and calls again for ear­ly-phase tri­als re­form

The FDA will con­sid­er more re­al-world da­ta in drug and de­vice ap­pli­ca­tions, in­clud­ing from large datasets that don’t have iden­ti­fi­able pa­tient da­ta, Com­mis­sion­er Mar­ty Makary told a Wall Street au­di­ence on Mon­day in New York.

In his re­marks to biotech in­vestors and bankers, Makary al­so re­it­er­at­ed the agency’s de­sire to make changes to the ear­li­est phas­es of hu­man test­ing — part of the ad­min­is­tra­tion’s ef­forts to find poli­cies that will help com­pa­nies com­pete with fast-mov­ing Chi­na-based biotechs.

As part of the FDA’s da­ta plans, the agency [an­nounced Mon­day](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-eliminates-major-barrier-using-real-world-evidence-drug-and-device-application-reviews) that it will al­low the use of da­ta that don’t in­clude “pri­vate, con­fi­den­tial in­for­ma­tion at the in­di­vid­ual pa­tient lev­el,” a broad­en­ing of its cur­rent stan­dard that could in­clude large, re­al-world datasets from in­sur­ers, hos­pi­tals or pa­tient reg­istries, for ex­am­ple.

The new guid­ance is first aimed at med­ical de­vice mak­ers, but the agency says it in­tends to re­lease sim­i­lar ad­vice for drugs and bi­o­log­ics. The FDA said that since 2016, 35 ap­pli­ca­tions from drug, bi­o­log­ics or vac­cine mak­ers have in­clud­ed re­al-world da­ta.

At an event at the New York Stock Ex­change on Mon­day, Makary said that “we want peo­ple to be able to sub­mit what­ev­er re­al-world da­ta they want to sub­mit.”

“If it’s not ad­e­quate, if it’s junk, if it doesn’t add to the case for ap­proval, then we’ll cer­tain­ly let the com­pa­nies know,” he said.

#### Chi­na com­pe­ti­tion

Makary al­so not­ed Chi­na’s as­cen­sion in the glob­al R&D land­scape, marked by the num­ber of tri­als run in the coun­try com­pared to the US. He said the US need­ed to be “more com­pet­i­tive” with its IND and Phase 1 tri­al process­es.

“That’s where we get caught right now as a coun­try, and that’s what we no­ticed when we came to of­fice,” he said. “We’re go­ing to do every­thing we can to make that process more ef­fi­cient in the Unit­ed States, to be able to com­pete more ef­fec­tive­ly.”

Ex­pe­dit­ing how new tri­als get off the ground has been a con­sis­tent part of feed­back that the in­dus­try has giv­en to Makary and his team. Dur­ing a sum­mer lis­ten­ing tour with biotech and phar­ma ex­ec­u­tives, at­ten­dees [at a Boston meet­ing](https://endpoints.news/fda-to-biotech-ceos-us-is-lagging-behind-on-early-stage-trials/) sug­gest­ed to Makary that the FDA re­form in­ves­ti­ga­tion­al re­view boards, bod­ies that help mon­i­tor hu­man clin­i­cal tri­als. But they can be [cum­ber­some to es­tab­lish](https://endpoints.news/bios-new-chair-on-fda-changes-most-favored-nation-pricing-and-china/), de­lay­ing a tri­al start.
