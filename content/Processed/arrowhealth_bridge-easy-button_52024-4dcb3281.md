ArrowBridge puts your platform in the EHR without integration.

## Slide 2: The Problem
### OCR Text:
МЕТАРНҮНEALTH
The Problem
"If clinicians need to log in to—and
work within—multiple applications
outside the EHR, it often adds to
the after-hours time they already
spend writing notes. As a result,
these technologies can quickly
become a burden that fails to gain
adoption, regardless of the
promised advantages to patient
care."
Crossing the Expectation Gap Report
HIMMS 2022

**Last Visit:**
Provider: William Mirell MD, J. Davis PA-C
Reason for Visit: Swollen Leg
Encounter Date: 10/02/2022
**HPI:**
Patient has a history of HTN, DM and chronic alcohol abuse and is presenting with lower extremity swelling. Patient notes one month of progressive, bilateral lower extremity swelling, in the past two weeks associated with increasing pain and redness and is now no longer able to ambulate due to pain. Patient denies fevers/chills, chest pain or shortness of breath. Patient also denies orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. Patient states that he has not had these symptoms prior to one month ago. On review of systems PT denies nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain, and changes in bowel or urinary habits. Patient has a history of Gl bleeding (unknown treatment) but denies hematemesis, hematochezia or melena. Patient has previously experienced alcohol withdrawal, which manifested as tremors, but no hallucinations or seizures.
**Assessment and Plan:**
Chronic bilateral lower extremity edema likely secondary to chronic venous insufficiency perhaps related to OSA given ultrasound findings of pulsatile flow in EIV's. Doubt systemic cause: no evidence of heart failure on exam and normal BNP, no stigmata of cirrhosis and normal albumin, normal creatinine. Also, no evidence of DVT on ultrasound though bilateral DVT unlikely. Bilateral cellulitis also unlikely as the patient is afebrile without leukocytosis, however the patient was started on antibiotics including ceftriaxone and TMP/SMX given erythema, warmth and tenderness to palpation. The patient received benzodiazepines which eased withdrawal symptoms and was admitted for continued treatment.

**Results:**

**Last Visit:**
Provider: M. Foote PA-C
Reason for Visit: Sore Throat
Encounter Date: 04/24/2023
**HPI:**
The patient reports steadily worsening sore throat over the past 2 days, associated with a sensation of swelling. The pain is described as sharp, 4/10 in severity, located on the left side of throat, and worsened with swallowing. Patient denies inability to swallow or difficulty breathing, patient also denies fever, cough, or new skin rashes.
**Assessment and Plan:**
No significant PMH with acute pharyngitis for 2 days. The most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is viral pharyngitis, potentially herpangina (given the appearance of the tonsillar lesion). A more serious viral/bacterial pharyngitis is less likely given the absence of fever or significant erythema/exudate. There was no uvular deviation to suggest peritonsillar abscess and no evidence of airway obstruction to suggest other acute processes (epiglottitis, retropharyngeal abscess). The plan is to recommend supportive care and ibuprofen for symptomatic relief. The patient will be discharged home in good condition with precautions to return if symptoms worsen or patient begins to have difficulty swallowing/breathing.
