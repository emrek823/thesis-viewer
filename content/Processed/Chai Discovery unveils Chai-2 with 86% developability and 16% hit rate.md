# Chai Discovery Unveils Chai-2 Breakthrough

Chai Discovery unveiled Chai-2, the first zero-shot generative platform to achieve double-digit success rates in de novo antibody design.

## Key Performance Metrics

- **Hit Rate:** 16% success in fully de novo antibody design (100x improvement over previous methods)
- **Developability:** >86% of full-length mAbs have strong developability profiles on par with therapeutic antibodies
- **Format Conversion:** 93% of scFv hits retained activity when reformatted to full-length mAbs
- **Target Coverage:** ~50% of antibody targets yielded validated hits when testing <20 designs
- **Timeline:** AI design to wet-lab validation in under two weeks

## Developability Details

86% of designed antibodies demonstrated zero or one flagged problem, meeting common preclinical selection standards. 24 of 28 target antigens yielded at least one clean, drug-like candidate.

Designed antibodies exhibited:
- Nanomolar-range affinities
- Specificity for intended targets
- Strong developability profiles
- Resolved structures match in silico predictions

## Funding

- **Series B:** $130M (July 2025)
- **Valuation:** $1.3B
- **Investors:** OpenAI, others
- **Use:** Scale Chai-2, accelerate AI-designed antibody pipeline

## Implications

Chai-2 proves computational methods can solve the binding-to-druggable gap. 86% developability in silico means wet lab is no longer required for discovery phase—the moat shifts downstream to clinical outcome data.
