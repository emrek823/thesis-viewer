### Fundraising Decision & Terms

- Kevin agreed to proceed with bridge round after discussing with team
- Final terms agreed: $2.5M on $35M cap (~5.71% dilution)
	- Virtue investing $2M (doubling their previous $1.8M investment)
	- Additional $500K available if needed
	- Same terms as previous safe, just updated dates/numbers
- Goal: accelerate hiring and data collection rather than extend runway
- Position for stronger Series A ($30-50M target vs typical $15-20M)

### Strategic Context & Rationale

- Kevin returned from JPM conference with positive momentum
	- AstraZeneca meeting exceeded expectations
	- Panel discussion on AI agents calling foundation models
- Current funding efficiency highlighted: only $5M total raised (including this round)
- Virtue’s confidence signal: largest relative investment in their portfolio
- Timeline pressure: want commercial deals (Sanofi) before Series A to avoid 25-30% dilution

### Valuation Considerations

- Balancing act: meaningful step-up from $22.5M (5 months ago) without overvaluation
- No Sanofi deal yet = biggest risk factor for valuation justification
- Target Series A dilution: 12-15% vs market typical 25-30%
- Kevin focused on absolute dilution impact over specific valuation metrics

### Next Steps

- Sean to draft updated safe documents immediately
- Same legal terms as previous round, only numbers/dates changing
- Kevin may take small check from Dave Messina (Pioneer) for connections
- Mo from Sunflowers requesting data room access (deferred until post-Sanofi)
