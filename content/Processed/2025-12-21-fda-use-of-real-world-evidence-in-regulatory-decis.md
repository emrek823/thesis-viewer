The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has a long history of using real-world data (RWD) and real-world evidence (RWE) to monitor and evaluate the postmarket safety of medical products and is committed to realizing the full potential of fit-for-use RWD to generate RWE that can advance the development of medical products and strengthen their oversight. The studies presented in the accompanying tables exemplify instances in which the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) and the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) applied RWE in regulatory decision-making processes since 2011. These include, but are not limited to, product approvals, labeling changes, and assessments that determined no regulatory action was warranted. This compilation forms part of a comprehensive landscape analysis to assess the scope and frequency of RWE use in regulatory determinations across the Agency.

| **Drugs and identifiers** | **Sponsor** | **Data Source** | **Study Design** | **Summary of RWE use or Regulatory Action** | **Date of Regulatory Action and Labeling** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Aurlumyn® (Iloprost)  NDA 217933 | Eicos Sciences | Medical records | Retrospective cohort study | **Role of study:** Confirmatory evidence A multicenter retrospective cohort study of frostbite patients with a historical control that used data from medical records and that was published in the literature in July 2022 was used as confirmatory evidence. | February 13,2024 [Labeling](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2024/217933s000lbl.pdf) |
| Vimpat® (Lacosamide)  NDA 022253 | UCB | Medical records from the PEDSnet data network. | Retrospective cohort study | **Role of the study:** Safety The agency was able to extrapolate efficacy for the treatment of partial onset seizures (in patients aged ≥ 1 month < 17 years) and primary generalized tonic–clonic seizures (in patients aged ≥ 4 years to < 17 years) from existing data, but additional safety data were needed to support the new proposed loading dose regimen. The applicant was able to leverage safety data from existing clinical use of the new regimen through a cohort study that used medical record data collated by the PEDSnet data network. | April 28, 2023   [Labeling](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2023/022253s050,022254s040,022255s032lbl.pdf) |
| Actemra (Tocilizumab)  BLA 125276 | Genentech | RWD source for primary efficacy endpoint: national death records​ | Randomized controlled trial | **Role of the study:** Adequate and well-controlled (AWC) study that generated substantial evidence of effectiveness. The approval was based, in part, on a randomized controlled clinical trial that leveraged RWD collected from national death records to evaluate 28-day mortality, the trial’s primary endpoint. | December 21, 2022   [Labeling](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2022/125276s138lbl.pdf) |
| Vijoice® (Alpelisib)  NDA 215039 | Novartis | Medical Records | Non-interventional study (single arm) | **Role of the study:** Adequate and well-controlled study that generated substantial evidence of effectiveness. The approval was based on a single-arm study of data from patients who were treated through an expanded access program. Medical record data were derived from seven sites across five countries. As noted in the review, “since lesions would not be expected to regress in the absence of active therapy, the review team considered the endpoint of radiologic response rate at Week 24 as reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit.” | April 5, 2022 [Labeling](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2022/215039s000lbledt.pdf) |
| Orencia® (Abatacept)  BLA 125118 | Bristol Meyers Squibb | Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) registry | Non-interventional study | **Role of the study:** Pivotal evidence. The approval was based on a traditional randomized clinical trial in patients with a matched unrelated donor and a non-interventional study in patients with a one allele-mismatched unrelated donor. The outcome assessed in the non-interventional study was overall survival post-transplantation among patients administered treatment with abatacept compared with patients treated without abatacept. The study used data from the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) registry, an international registry of patients receiving cellular therapies. | December 15, 2021 [Labeling](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2021/125118s240lbl.pdf) |
| Voxzogo® (Vosoritide)  NDA 214938 | Biomarin | Achondroplasia Natural History (AchNH) study, a multicenter registry in the United States. | Externally controlled trials | **Role of Study:** Confirmatory evidence. The approval was based on one randomized clinical trial and RWE generated through two single-arm trials with external control groups from RWD comprised of patient-level anthropometric data obtained from the Achondroplasia Natural History (AchNH) study, a multicenter registry in the United States. | November 19, 2021 [Labeling](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2021/214938Orig1s000Corrected_lbl.pdf) |
| Prograf® (Tacrolimus)  NDA 050708 | Astellas Pharma INC | Disease Registry-Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients | Non-interventional study | **Role of the study:** AWC study that generated substantial evidence of effectiveness. The approval was in part based on a non-interventional study that evaluated graft failure and death up to one year post transplant in recipients of single-or double-lung transplants enrolled in the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients registry (SRTR), a source of RWD on organ transplant outcomes in the United States. Clinical outcomes in the treatment arm were compared with the well-documented natural history of lung transplant with no or minimal immunosuppression. Randomized controlled clinical trials in the setting of other solid organ transplants provided confirmatory evidence to support the approval. | July 16, 2021 [Labeling](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2021/050708s053,050709s045,210115s005lbl.pdf) |
| Nulibry® (Fosdenopterin)  NDA 214018 | Sentynl Therapeutics | Medical Records | Single-arm trial with additional treatment data derived from RWD and comparator data derived from RWD.​ | **Role of the study:** Adequate and well-controlled (AWC)​ study that generated substantial evidence of effectiveness. The study that led to the approval included RWD in both the treatment and control arms. Specifically, the treatment arm pooled data from participants in two single-arm trials with data from patients enrolled in an expanded access program. The external control arm included data from a natural history study of patients with confirmed MoCD Type A. Real-world data (RWD) evaluating overall survival, the primary endpoint of the study, was obtained from medical records across 15 countries for both the expanded access population included in the treatment arm and the natural history control arm population. | February 26, 2021 [Labeling](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2021/214018s000lbl.pdf) |

| CLOZARIL (clozapine)  NDA 019758 | Heritage Life Sciences (Barbados) c/o Heritage Life Sciences Therapeutics (USA) | Veterans Health Administration (VHA) medical and pharmacy records | Descriptive study | In FDA’s review of the effectiveness of the clozapine REMS, FDA conducted several analyses of clozapine registry patients, describing adherence to absolute neutrophil count monitoring, as specified by the clozapine REMS, and estimating the cumulative risk of severe neutropenia. The study results were included in the November 19 Joint Meeting of the Drug Safety and Risk Management and Psychopharmacologic Drugs Advisory Committee briefing package, where the committee voted to remove the clozapine REMS. Based on the advice from the Advisory Committee and the Agency’s re-evaluation, the Agency removed the clozapine REMS and issued a DSC. | DSC August 27,2025  [FDA Drug Safety Communication: FDA removes risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) program for the antipsychotic drug Clozapine](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-removes-risk-evaluation-and-mitigation-strategy-rems-program-antipsychotic-drug-clozapine) (REMS release, labeling changes) |
| Toprol-XL and Lopressor (Metoprolol), Inderal LA (propranolol), [beta blockers]  Multiple NDAs | Multiple sponsors | [Sentinel System](https://www.sentinelinitiative.org) | Retrospective cohort study | The results from a retrospective cohort study in Sentinel indicated an association between beta blocker use and hypoglycemia in pediatric populations. FDA approved safety labeling changes to describe the risk for hypoglycemia in pediatrics or individuals unable to communicate signs of hypoglycemia. This resulted in a labeling change. | Beta Blockers Safety Communications & Labeling Changes (Sentinel Initiative), July. 25, 2025. [FDA Labeling Change: Additional Language to Mitigate the Risk of Hypoglycemia Associated with Beta Blockers in Children](https://www.sentinelinitiative.org/news-events/fda-safety-communications-labeling-changes/fda-labeling-change-additional-language)      [Beta blockers | Sentinel Initiative](https://www.sentinelinitiative.org/studies/drugs/beta-blockers) |
