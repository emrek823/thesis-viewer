        *   "keke Hey you guys, for some of you this may be TMI, but for me my platform has always been used for things much greater than me. Poly Cystic Ovarian Syndrome has been attacking me from the inside out my entire life and I had no idea. My acne has been so bad that people in my field offered to pay for me to get it fixed. I tried EVERYTHING. I did Accutane TWICE. People say drink water, have a better diet, but I did all that, I ate all the "right" things, my blood tests were fine. But it took ME taking a personal look into my family that has a history of diabetes and obesity, to understand what was ACTUALLY happening with me. And unfortunately doctors are people and if you don't "look the part" they may not think that's your problem. They may not even suggest it if you "look healthy" whatever that means! I came to a doctor in tears once and all they offered was a measles vaccine... Exactly."
        *   "I'm posting this to say that it's okay and we can help ourselves. My skin has made me sad many nights but I do not give up on myself. I know this is not me and my body has been looking for help. I do not have a medical degree but I did the research and took what I learned to a doctor and that led them to a proper diagnosis. I'm not saying trust web md for everything haha but what I am saying is no one can help us like we can help ourselves."
        *   "This especially makes me sad because my family struggled for years and no doctor could help them, they actually mislead them and just took their money. It's only because of what my family sacrificed that allows me to even have the resources to share the information I'm sharing with you! Their fight out of poverty gave me a better life and I just want to share what I learn"

    *   "I've been working with an incredible telemedicine company called @allarahealth. They connected me with a doctor + registered dietician who have basically been acting as my "get off BC" coaches. There are other non-skin related side effects to my PCOS too, and we're slowly working on solutions. It feels really great to have a healthcare team say "we don't have all the answers, but we're listening to you and are going to figure this out""

**Patient Testimonials:**

*   **CM** (1 review, US, Updated Feb 8, 2022)
    *   "Allara health has seriously changed my life!! I have gone to several doctors for years to find the answers to my hormonal problems. I have been diagnosed with PCOS by an endocrinologist, but I wasn't getting much help or improvement with my condition. I signed up with Allara because I had no where else to turn. After my first appointment with Dr. H, I knew that I was in the right hands. She is very knowledgeable about PCOS and offered real solutions. I got complete blood work that was much more comprehensive than my endocrinologist ran. At our second appointment, Dr. H went over all of my blood results and explained them so that I could understand them. She then made a plan that I could easily follow. It's been two months and I feel so much better. My labs have improved, my symptoms have improved and I've lost around 10 pounds. I can't think Allara and Dr. H enough."

*   **CU** (1 review, US, 4 days ago)
    *   "I love Allara Health! Highly recommend. I love Allara Health! Their professionals team up to make healthy living easier. Not only have I learned so many techniques and facts about happy hormones but I've learned so much about what I can do for myself to improve my PCOS. Thanks Allara!"

*   **GU** (1 review, US, Feb 10, 2022)
    *   "I have struggled with PCOS... I have struggled with PCOS (unknowingly) for the last 7 years. The moment I met with Dr. Stone, I felt super super comfortable. She took her time explaining the ins and outs of PCOS, lab work, medications, it finally felt like I found my niche. I met with Genevive my rock star nutritionist who came up with goals that work for ME! I met with a few dietician's prior but nothing worked at all.. Genevive has been there to deal with all of my nutrition questions no matter how small! Natasha who is patient access is extraordinary, always gets back in a timely fashion! I cannot thank my team enough for this amazing next step in my life, where I'm in control. Allara's service is above and beyond what I thought it would've originally been. Fantastic people, affordable, lovely care, I'm so so thankful."

## Slide 20: Patient Pregnancy Success Stories
### 7 patients have gotten pregnant naturally
### since working with Allara

"After seeing multiple doctors for my PCOS and growing frustrated with the blanket prescriptions
and impersonal care, I finally started working with a dietician through Allara and was given
personalized guidance based on my own blood work and lifestyle habits. Within 2 months my
cycle was regular for the first time in 15 years and I conceived within 3 months! I really can't
thank the Allara team enough."

"Allara health has been life-changing for me, I was diagnosed with PCOS after 10+ years of slowly
growing symptoms, and my former Primary Care doc in Chicago sending me to specialists who would see
me for 10 minutes, write me a prescription and tell me to lose weight. Even with a diagnosis, I still wasn't
given guidance and I was lost with all of the misinformation that exists out there. Then I found Allara. It is
accessible, my doctor and RDN help explain things to me, they provided me with a personalized plan for
my specific needs and I can text/email anytime and expect a fast turn-around with answers to my
questions. Thank you, Allara for helping me to take control and to feel better. I'm manifesting you're also
going to be the reason for baby McClure in 2022- stay tuned!”

## Slide 31: Patient Testimonial
### Patient Testimonial

"Allara health has seriously changed my life!! I have gone to several doctors for
years to find the answers to my hormonal problems. I have been diagnosed with PCOS
by an endocrinologist, but I wasn't getting much help or improvement with my
condition. I signed up with Allara because I had nowhere else to turn. After my first
appointment with Dr. H, I knew that I was in the right hands. She is very knowledgeable
about PCOS and offered real solutions. I got complete blood work that was much more
comprehensive than my endocrinologist ran. At our second appointment, Dr. H went
over all of my blood results and explained them so that I could understand them. She
then made a plan that I could easily follow. It's been two months and I feel so much
better. My labs have improved, my symptoms have improved and I've lost around 10
pounds. I can't thank Allara and Dr. H enough.”
