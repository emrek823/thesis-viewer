## Slide 1: Cover
# ARTERYS
What if you could transform medical imaging using the power of the internet?
November, 2019 | Confidential

## Slide 2: Highlights
**Market Opportunity:** $12B Medical Imaging Industry.
*   Plan to reach $50M in ARR and a 1000 hospitals/imaging centers on Arterys by 2024

**Challenge:** 100% offline with on premise legacy solutions for medical image processing that can't support market innovation.

**Industry Trend:** AI models explosion that can't be deployed in legacy offline infrastructure. The AI apps market for medical imaging is expected to reach $2B by 2023. The time is now.
*   3 years trend exhibited by startups, academics, medical device/pharma companies
*   Hospitals and imaging centers are moving from offline to online.
*   By 2021, the cloud market is predicted to surpass on-premise

**Platform Solution:** Arterys is the first true ALL internet based platform for medical imaging and become the platform of choice for AI and medical imaging.
*   6 years of development to create a unique and scalable AI platform
*   3 years lead with a FDA/CE cleared scalable platform to capture the market.
*   Viewer performance and Medical imaging analytics
*   Online work station for radiologists

**Marketplace Solution:** Arterys started to scale with its own apps and is now opening its API and a marketplace to offer a simple way to translate AI into clinical applications and distribute them globally.
*   $20k and $50k per app/per year per hospital (or % of the hospital volume)
*   30/70 typical revenue share on the marketplace on top of a platform fee.
*   20+ AI models integrated to date the plan is to reach 160+ next year increasing the average revenue from $20k (1 app) to $100k (4-5 apps) per provider per year.

**Go-to-market:** The go-to-market is achieved with channel partners. The first 2 are GE and Siemens and Arterys is now expanding it's channel partners with PACS, RIS and other to accelerate the number of hospital and imaging centers connections. Arterys has already successfully reached 100 hospitals connects and demonstrating that an internet based platform can be used at scale globally.

    *   Arterys is the first and ONLY true online internet based platform

## Slide 7: There is an explosion of AI models that can't deployed
All healthcare groups are building medical imaging based AI models. Now they are realizing that they can't deploy it.
*   1000+ data scientists
*   100+ startups
*   Pharma companies
*   Medical devices
*   Google, Microsoft, etc

*(Visual representation shows a funnel where AI models from Academics, Medical device, Startups, and Pharma feed into a bottleneck, resulting in "X Economical value" and "X Clinical value". A "$12B" label is also present).*

*(The slide also includes a collage of logos from various companies and groups across General Imaging, Cardiovascular Imaging, Lung Imaging, Neurological Imaging, and Breast Imaging, each labeled with "AI model").*

## Slide 9: Radiology moving towards AI
**UCSF Launches Artificial Intelligence Center to Advance Medical Imaging**
"Intelligent Imaging" Hub will Harness Computational Tools in Medical Imaging to Improve Patient Care
By Elizabeth Fernandez
*Research October 11, 2019*

**Hospitals to invest $2 billion every year in AI for diagnostic imaging**
With the interest in AI on the rise during the last 18 months, the technologies are expected to transform productivity and accuracy.
Bernie Monegain, Editor, Healthcare IT News
*AUG 03, 2018 MORE ON STRATEGIC PLANNING*

**Stanford University - Center for Artificial Intelligence in Medicine & Imaging**
The AIMI Center
Stanford has established the AIMI Center to develop, evaluate, and disseminate artificial intelligence systems to benefit patients. We conduct research that solves clinically important imaging problems using machine learning and other AI techniques.

**Managed Healthcare EXECUTIVE**
AI Adoption Growing Rapidly Among Health Industry Leaders

## Slide 10: Challenge #1: Outdated infrastructure negatively impacts patients
**Patient care is negatively impacted by outdated legacy infrastructure.**

Medical imaging today is built on outdated infrastructure contributing to high levels of image misreads/errors, a lack of coordination and collaboration, ultimately contributing to misdiagnosis and lower survival rates.

**Patients up to**
**50%**
50% or more of patients who have been admitted in a hospital receive a medical imaging study.

**Misreads up to**
**30%**
30% of medical imaging cases are misread while market sees 10% increase in studies YoY.

**Cases up to**
**500M**
US statistics. WW is 3x. 10% growth rate

**Source:** Link 1 and Link 2

## Slide 11: Challenge #2: There is a severe radiologist deficit across markets
**49% of radiologist suffer from burnout.**

That leaves the 2025 projected shortage of radiologists in the U.S. in the tens of thousands.

Royal College of Radiologists report nearly **97 percent** of radiology departments in the U.K. are unable to meet diagnostic reporting requirements, leaving patients waiting a month or more for their imaging results.

**Radiologists increase by**
**2%**

**Study to year increase by**
**10%**

**Study volume to year increase by**
**30%**

*(Arrow pointing down from the increases to a warning sign)*
**Radiologist deficit predicted**

**Source:** Link 1

## Slide 12: Challenge #3: No clinical workflow or deployment platform to transform AI into clinical applications
**AI without a clinical workflow is unusable.**

Radiologist need a fully application that integrates AI seamlessly to be used clinically.

**Comparison:**
*   **AI = NO time saving**
*   **AI + clinical workflow = Time saving**

*(Image shows a medical imaging viewer with multiple studies, actions, toolbar, controls panels, and an AI indicator on Study 4).*
*   **Studies** (Study 1, Study 2, Study 3, Study 4)
*   **Actions**
*   **Toolbar**
*   **Viewer** (Different studies)
*   **Controls Panels**
*   **AI** (highlighted on Study 4)

## Slide 13: Challenge #4: No distribution. Makers can't meet buyers.
Legacy offline infrastructure prevents AI from being deployed and distributed.

## Slide 22: Business model: Subscription and yearly recurrent fee
**ARR = Number of connections to radiology practices X ARR per connection (# apps x volume of cases per year)**

Each clinical app = **$20k - $40k / year / hospital**
