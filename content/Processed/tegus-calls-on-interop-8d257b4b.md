# Expert Call Excerpts

## Experts see data as commodified, next frontier is normalizing & activating data

### Data Commodification:
* [On why picking Health Gorilla]: it was just mainly breadth of access to records and HIEs and what their reach is. And after that, quite frankly, the other pieces are fairly commodity. But with the 21st Century Cures Act and O&P rules and things like that, our perspective is that reach and breadth as a differentiator is probably not going to be a sustainable moat here." - **Medical Director, Oak Street**
* "My speculation is that over time, all this interoperability will become a commodity, right? So if we come back to my earlier analogy that CommonWell and Carequality provides the road infrastructure and Health Gorilla and other start-ups are providing the transportation means like the trucks going from point A to point B, right? I mean if you have the metaphor or analogy, I mean, you can see that it's so common nowadays, right? So how do we innovate on the top of it. I think that's the thing, which is last for these newcomers, these new digital startups. And in that space, there are there are plenty of things to do.” – **Former CPO, Health Gorilla**
* "But because it was at the end of the day, pretty commoditized, we felt, we didn't feel like we needed to compare too much. We got a pretty good price with Health Gorilla and decided perhaps wasn't going to differentiate too much. The case they made was that their FHIR data model was more pure than Health Gorilla. But we never really figured out what they meant by that because both were returning FHIR results.” – **Senior PM, Oscar**
* “I do see a world in which there could be more channels of a better relationship between the sources of data, between HIEs and the EHR systems. I do think that there is definitely a value add for somebody like a Particle or a Health Gorilla, who can serve that up to you in a platter so that you don't have to deal with all the nitty-gritty aspects." - **Former Lead Technical Acct Manager, Particle Health**
* Clinical and claims data becomes the table stakes, but those are getting commoditized, and you need more. As you are taking more risk, you need social determinants of health, you need medication data because medication management is important. – **SVP and Head of Product, Innovaccer**

### Future Differentiation:
* "I'll tell you two things that come to mind for me. Number one, if you have all of the health plans information and data about all of their members and about all of their claims and encounter data, that's a very rich data set of clinical information... I'll offer a population health management product...products that categorize your membership into different areas of risk stratification (as Innovaccer has done)" – **CIO at Regional Health Plan**
* “It's the insights – help derive clinical meaning from the noise and all data. Health Gorilla is marginally furthest along on this path, but Particle appears to be catching up. Innovaccer arguably does this best but only for big customers and after long implementation. Commure and Zus are trying to build this as software, they assume that data is commodified and value accrues to the orchestration / insights layer." - **Medical Director, Oak Street**
* "Yes. I would say where it falls short is that Plaid has a larger suite of products. At the end of the day, Particle, even if it's going to be delivering different types of data, you're going to becoming a Particle for the API. Plaid also has a front-end tool that you can use. They just have a more robust suite of products. I could see that changing and that Particle or Health Gorilla also could come out with other types of products. At least for now, people just want the data.” – **Former Lead Technical Acct Manager, Particle Health**

## Health Gorilla vs Particle
* We did have a decent amount of folks leaving Health Gorilla and coming over to check out Particle, some of them converted to customers, some of them didn't. What we heard from them was that their API was a lot more cumbersome. To give you an example of how Particle's API works, API requests or calls to their API and you get what you need. With Health Gorilla, from what our clients told us, it was a ton of different things you have to do programmatically to sit through and get the data that you needed. This wasn't very user-friendly. – **Former Lead Technical Acct Manager, Particle Health**
* "The other difference is that Health Gorilla is happy to offer a front-end tool for providers to use in a live capacity versus Particle. They do have a portal, but they don't want folks coming in there on a day-to-day basis to use it to look at medical records." – **Former Lead Technical Acct Manager, Particle Health**
* "I think it's an integration piece, right? So moving from record retrieval to, can you process the data and make sense of it? Because, as I mentioned before, Particle is great in terms of the reach. But what I think a lot of their customers are increasingly realizing, like oh, no, like we're getting the records. And now that we're seeing is that we actually have a record and it's not in a pretty format, and our providers are getting really upset because they're now medically and legally responsible for what's in these records, but it's not in a format that's clean and usable." – **Medical Director, Oak Street**

## Innovaccer
### SVP and Head of Product, Innovaccer
* [Who's the customer]: You'll see most of them [Health systems] are using either Innovaccer, Arcadia or you're using Cerner's HealtheIntent and Epic's Healthy Planet as their population health management solution. Aledade is neither a technology company nor a health system. They are a group. They have their own technology, but technology is not their secret sauce. They are not selling their technology to anyone.”
* [What Innovaccer does]: “The crux of value-based care is that you want to reduce cost and increase quality of care. To do that, you need to be able to identify the right patient at the right time and then put them in the right workflow. The first thing you need is that you need to make sure that you have a data that you trust and all the data. You need longitudinal patient record of patients, which is a combination of clinical and claims data and labs and pharmacy data and ADT feeds and as much as possible. Now things are going to SDOH, social determinants of health, and a bunch of other data sets anyways. You've got all the data, you've created a longitudinal patient record. Then you need certain analytics. The industry is pretty mature in a way that most people are still running standard analytics. How many of my patients have diabetes and have not done an annual wellness visit test? ...[then] you need a workflow to be able to address to them. You need provider engagement”
* [Core of Product]: “In the simplest form, yes, normalizing it, managing quality of data and then ability to expose it then through APIs in a real-time manner." [shared in context of comparing other businesses to Innovaccer (Clarify for patient engagement, Epic for provider management, etc)]
* [How scaled players use Innovaccer]: “We have some practices which are owned by Optum, but they use Innovaccer because they don't like it. Optum has a full stack of solutions. Aledade has been building its own solution, but it's a mismatch up solution. They've bought a bunch of applications from here and there, while they're trying to own the data platform side."
* [Size of Opportunity]: “The tool sets, you need a CRM, you need a data model, you need certain analytics, remains the same across different disease categories. What has not been solved very well and a company like Innovaccer is doing and a bunch of others are doing. That's the reason Cerner sold itself to Oracle because they really want to focus on data platform and they thought they could build it better with Oracle. The point is the platform has not been built in health care, and it will be built. Whoever builds it, builds a $100 billion business.”
