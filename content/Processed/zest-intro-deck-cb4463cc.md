### Sync with Your Health Coach Anytime
- Mobile app video call interface with a person

### Track Practices that Improve Your Condition
- Mobile app interface showing "Diet" recommendations

    - Psoriasis causes inflammation. Certain foods can cause inflammation as well. Avoiding those foods might help improve symptoms. These foods include:
      - Red meat
      - Refined sugar
      - Highly processed foods
      - Dairy products
      - Alcohol
    - Alcohol consumption can increase your risk of a flare-up. Cutting back or quitting entirely can help lower your risk. If you have alcohol use disorder, your doctor can help you create a treatment plan.

### Traditional Dermatology
- x Undertrained on chronic care
- x Stress causes vicious flare cycle
- x Nutritional and psychosocial needs remain under-addressed

### Zest Platform
- Proactively addresses underlying causes of flares through better suited, lower cost health coaches
