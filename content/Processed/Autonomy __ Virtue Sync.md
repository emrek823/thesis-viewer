### Financing Structure Discussion

- Two pathways discussed for investment structure:
	- SAFE
		- Options: NCO treatment or convert end of year
		- Key question: How comfortable can we get with NCO treatment?
	- Convertible Note (CN)
- Team leaning towards Convertible Note because:
	- Speeds up process
	- Provides optimal tax outcomes
	- Puts forcing function on conversion to equity
	- Cleaner from LP docs perspective
	- Minimizes potential future restructuring needs

### Current Cap Table & ESOP

- Current equity structure:
	- 2% stock option pool allocated for advisors only
	- No employee stock options yet
- Discussion of ESOP considerations:
	- Historical pools have ranged up to 15% in last four years
	- Need to plan for employee equity between now and Series A
	- Current focus on advisor equity only

### Wednesday Meeting Agenda

- Topics to discuss:
	- Start allocations for angels and friends/family investors
	- Hiring strategy and profiles
	- Strategic LP introductions, especially in Texas
	- Internal tools assessment
	- Series A planning:
		- Target: $3M gross profit
		- Pipeline requirements
		- Success rate metrics
	- Communication cadence preferences

### Next Steps

- Cooley call scheduled for 2:30 PM Eastern to discuss tax implications
- MoFo team to be contacted regarding tax counsel perspective
- Team to send Google Doc with detailed agenda for Wednesday’s meeting
- Will handle any additional legal expenses on their side
- Need to resolve structure (CN vs SAFE) within next day or two
