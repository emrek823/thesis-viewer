# Dart Health 2025 EOY Feedback - Veeraj Responses

**Summary:** Strong 2025 execution: 5x revenue growth, ACV doubled ($35K → $80K), hit profitability, CHAP distribution win. These questions are about sharpening the 2026 strategy before our Jan 15 call.

## 1. What happened to the oncology co-pilot strategy?

**Our Question:** October 9 sync called it a "major strategic pivot" with John Muir board meeting in 2 weeks, Tennessee Oncology (100+ oncologists), MD Anderson conversations, $500-1K/user pricing. December memo doesn't mention oncology once. John Muir now listed with Discharge Planning, Malnutrition, Nursing Copilot.

**Veeraj's Response:**
Despite interest, as a wedge it wasn't strong enough because orgs didn't understand differentiation fast enough (OpenEvidence/Doximity) & ROI felt too ambiguous. Also, see OpenAI/Anthropic launches.

Long term, it's still a strong expansion use case.

## 2. Why AI Data Analyst as the hospital wedge?

**Our Question:** Innovaccer raised $275M at $3.45B in January 2026, serves 6 of top 10 US health systems, and is launching AI co-pilots for CNOs. Health Catalyst is releasing free AI analytics toolkits. TextQL launched their healthcare vertical in October 2025 with Lumeris as a marquee client, pitching the exact same wedge: "AI agents that turn days of analyst work into seconds." Your October sync noted Cleveland Clinic's "preference for prestigious vendors." What's the 30-second differentiation pitch?

**Veeraj's Response:**
In our market, they are incumbents. Innovaccer / Health Catalyst products answer simple data questions on top of their dashboards/DBs (similar to Tableau Next, Snowflake Cortex, Salesforce Agentforce). These tools are well known to be basic SQL search.

When it comes to clinical data analysis (e.g a head of surgery is interested in finding out which cases have the highest rate of readmissions) there are decision traces that exist only in email threads or actual conversations between BI & Surgery. These can only be ingested in-workflow.

**Our context layer allows us to let an AI analyst roam & complete larger analysis end to end in the same format as a clinical operations leader.** Ask any data analyst, they have to double/triple check with clinical team members what definition of LOS they want or what range of glucose is considered "extreme" for their intended analysis.

We can query, break down by department (this is where Innovaccer/Health Catalyst stops), and analyze (unstructured) sample safety reports, clinical notes, etc to provide an analysis that only a technical clinician could ever generate.

**On TextQL:** I've chatted with their founder. Like their launch with Lumeris they don't plan to support "Care Providers" directly (only those interested in an API/SDK willing to build out the remaining on their own, integrations, data cleaning, etc.). Unless you're talking to a sophisticated eng team, TextQL isn't friendly. Plus, they don't allow for custom tool calling, don't support context (only semantic relationships), and focus solely on high level data analysis.

**The differentiation:** Dart becomes the de-facto knowledge base of decision making across clinical operations, allowing AI to navigate workflows that were previously in the brain of a CNO or Head of Periop.

## 3. What was the total ACV and customer count you intentionally churned?

**Our Question:** The memo mentions cutting contracts <$65K that "weren't strong enough for scale" in Q3-Q4. How many customers did you exit? What was the total ACV walked away from? Any regrets or lessons from specific accounts?

**Veeraj's Response:**
~$400K, 8 customers. This was hard to do. **ARR is now just over $1.2M.** We're closing the gap on this quickly but this is definitely some short term pain for long term growth. We're focused on $10M not $2M.

Here is some basic criteria we now use (in addition to the standard ROI) to jump in front of this:
- **Internal Resources** - Do they have team members & resources on their side that are invested in & prioritize a timely, successful deployment?
- **Depth** - Do they view us as an AI solutions partner & want to continue optimizing other aspects of their business with us? Generally, Enterprise customers ($100M+/yr) fit the criteria quite easily.

## 4. What's the pipeline conversion history?

**Our Question:** August targeted 3 health systems (Advent, Albany, ECU) by EOY. October had 2 deals at $350-400K "trying to close this month." December shows only 1 late-stage deal. The $3.5M "Others" pipeline from Kelly — what stage are those conversations?

**Veeraj's Response:**
- **Advent** - They were not able to push through new initiatives. The AI team is focusing on building vs buying. **Lost.**
- **Albany/ECU** - These conversations were focused on products that were poor wedges (malnutrition, discharge planning, etc) that would take an intense amount of resources. This made the decision a no-go. We'll be reaching out to different leaders now about the AI Data Analyst.

After these conversations, we took a step back & realized we needed to insert ourselves with a better wedge: AI Clinical Data Analyst.

**Kelly's Pipeline (4th week as Head of Post Acute sales):**

| Account | Stage | Contact | Focus | ACV |
|---------|-------|---------|-------|-----|
| Graham Healthcare ($GHC) | Early → Mid | Tony Ott (Head of IT) | Hospice HOPE QA + AI Data Analyst | $600K ($350K + $250K) |
| VITAS | Early | Bryan Wysong (EVP Ops) | QA (largest US hospice), AI Analyst | $650K ($500K + $150K) |
| CommonSpirit Health at Home | Early | TBD | Hospitalization Risks, Hospice Readiness | $250K |
| UNC Health System | Early → Mid | Barbara Knott (VP Continuing Care Services) | QA for home health, hospice, DME | $150K |
| Brooks Rehab | Mid (paused till Q2) | Melissa Cooper (VP Home Health Ops) | Home Health QA | $150K |
| Addus ($ADUS) | Early Prospect | Strong Kelly relationship with CIO | TBD | ~$500K |

**Total tracked from Kelly: $2M+ in ACV**

Our top of funnel was dry in Q3 → Q4 due to our focus on iterating product & sales strategy for the new market. October - December deals dragged out due to the holidays and will close well before the end of this quarter.

**Key learning:** Most of this is due to founder-led sales (dependence). Lots of learnings here - mainly surrounding building a trusted team & founders focusing on strategic initiatives to reduce growth dependence.

## 5. What's the realistic hiring timeline?

**Our Question:** Commercial hire was "immediate need" in August. Still "putting together dream team profiles" in late December. Lost a top AI/ML candidate in October to a $350K + 4-5% offer. When do Head of Commercial, Head of Eng, Head of Delivery realistically start?

**Veeraj's Response:**
- **Head of Eng:** Search Q1, Start Q2
- **Head of Success:** Search Q1, Start Q2
- **Head of Commercial:** Search Q1/Q2, Start Q3

## 6. Who runs hospital sales today?

**Our Question:** Zero hospital logos. Target: 15 at $300K in 2026. Is Veeraj running this directly? What's the playbook for different buyers (C-suite, IT committees) and different cycles (Epic integration, security reviews)?

**Veeraj's Response:**
Aakruti is running this till we have a strong headway with a few logos. Then, a Head of Commercial + Aakruti can run in parallel till Q3. After, the Head of Commercial will take over and have an early team, case studies, and a concrete playbook.

**Buyer Profiles:**
- **Chief Clinical Ops Officer** - We're focusing on a suite of data tasks that have been historically frustrating - Regulatory, Quality Measurement, Safety, OPPE/FPPE, etc.
- **IT** - Reduce BI request strain & ad-hoc requests - they want to focus on "AI" & other data engineering tasks anyways.

**Technical Cycles:** We've done this to a certain extent as we've had large enterprise prospects (VNA Albany took us through EPIC, several enterprise security teams took us through security review, etc). We've got SOC 2 Type 2, Pen Testing, etc. We usually fly through these just fine (<30 days).

We should have had more progress but due to us being stuck in the day to day of so many onboarding, product dev, etc sales slowed down heavily.

## 7. What's the current technical scale?

**Our Question:** August: 2M analyses on 200K patient records, $100/1K charts, 50+ use cases. What are those numbers now? Has inference cost dropped with Gemini 2.5? What % of new use cases reuse existing rules vs. require net-new creation?

**Veeraj's Response:**
- **Inference cost down ~50%**
- **Now doing over 100k reviews per week**
- Internal benchmarks: Sonnet (previously used) ~$700+ vs **$343 on Gemini** on the same task
- New models reduced reliance on Extend (Vision parsing) by 70%
- Overhauled harness over the last 3 months: **processing workflows 6x faster than before**

---

## 8. How does the "context moat" compound?

**Our Question:** Memo claims "most clinical <> operation rules aren't written anywhere." How many rules in the system today? What's the reuse rate across deployments? How quickly could a well-funded competitor with good domain experts replicate?

**Veeraj's Response:**
- **6,000+ rules for home health & hospice**
- Enterprises share context (rules): **40%**
- Enterprises share use cases: **60% per business line**
- Replication estimate: **6+ months** to replicate Home Health & Hospice context (after all tech has been built) for main use case (Quality Assurance)

**Key insight:** It's not domain expertise that solves the problem (e.g home health nurses have a hard time prompting a lot of what they analyze). It's the "how" - the ability to watch, learn, and save decision traces. This varies for each organization.

For example, each hospital has a semi-different approach to care coordination based on their partners & business lines. For the same reason, "well funded" makes little difference.

---

## 9. What are the key metrics you're tracking for infrastructure success?

**Our Question:** Time-to-deploy (first 5 customers vs. last 5)? Rules reuse rate across deployments? Cost per analysis trend? Accuracy gains from fine-tuning vs. off-the-shelf? These quantify the "context moat" claim.

**Veeraj's Response:**
- **First 5 customers:** 6 months to deploy
- **Last 5 customers:** 3 months to deploy
- Plus, the first 5 customers are about 3-5x smaller than the last 5 customers (in terms of scale of deployments)
- **Fine-tuning:** We've ditched fine tuning. There are 0 advantages when large scale model providers are able to scale intelligence & cost reduction at their current rate.

We haven't tracked anything very closely yet. But, recent onboarding cycles & customer excitement has been positive. Either way, it would be useful to have concrete data. This is where a Head of Success/Delivery would be very useful.

## Key Takeaways

### What's Working
1. **Disciplined churn:** Cut $400K/8 customers to focus on enterprise ($100M+/yr customers)
2. **Kelly's pipeline activation:** $2M+ ACV in pipeline within 4 weeks
3. **Cost efficiency:** Inference costs down 50%, 6x faster processing
4. **Context moat building:** 6,000+ rules, 40-60% reuse across enterprises
5. **Deployment velocity:** 6 months → 3 months time-to-deploy (2x improvement)

### What Needs Watching
1. **Oncology pivot:** Dropped due to differentiation confusion (OpenEvidence/Doximity) and ambiguous ROI
2. **Hospital sales:** Aakruti running solo, no logos yet, Head of Commercial Q3
3. **Pipeline:** Lost Advent (build vs buy), pivoted Albany/ECU to new wedge
4. **Hiring delays:** Key roles not starting until Q2-Q3
5. **Metrics tracking:** Need Head of Success to track infrastructure metrics properly

### Updated Financial Picture
- **ARR:** $1.2M (after $400K intentional churn)
- **Target ACV:** $250K by Q2 2026
- **Kelly's pipeline:** $2M+
- **Hospital target:** 15 @ $300K = $4.5M
