# Dart Feedback Email — Draft

**To:** Veeraj, Aakruti
**From:** Sean
**Subject:** 2025 Memo Feedback + Questions for Jan 15

---

Veeraj, Aakruti —

Thanks for the 2025 memo. Strong year: 5x revenue growth, ACV doubled, hit profitability, and the CHAP partnership is a real distribution win. The discipline to cut low-value customers is rare at this stage.

Before our Jan 15 call, a few questions that would help us dig in:

**Strategic Evolution**

1. In October, the oncology co-pilot was positioned as a "major strategic pivot" — John Muir board meeting, $500-1K/user pricing, Tennessee Oncology and MD Anderson in pipeline. The December memo doesn't mention oncology, and John Muir is now listed with Discharge Planning, Malnutrition, Nursing Copilot. What happened? Was it customer feedback, competitive dynamics, or build complexity?

2. The August pipeline targeted Advent, Albany, and ECU as the three health system customers for EOY. They're not in the December pipeline. Did these close, slip, or die?

3. If you had to choose between (a) closing the $6.7M pipeline or (b) landing 2-3 hospital logos with less total revenue, which would you prioritize and why?

**Pipeline & Execution**

4. What's the historical pipeline-to-close conversion rate? The October call mentioned 2 deals at $350-400K "trying to close this month" — what was the outcome?

5. The $3.5M "Others" pipeline from Kelly — how qualified is this? Early conversations or mid-stage?

6. Who is running hospital sales today? Is it you (Veeraj) directly?

**Hiring**

7. Head of Commercial, Head of Eng, Head of Delivery were flagged as "immediate needs" in August. The memo says you're "putting together dream team profiles." When do these roles realistically start? What's the backup plan if searches take 6+ months?

8. Are you using executive recruiters or founder-led search for senior hires?

**Competitive & Technical**

9. When you're head-to-head with Health Catalyst or Innovaccer on AI Data Analyst, what's the pitch? What makes a hospital pick Dart?

10. CHAP is a strategic win. Are there equivalent accreditation bodies for hospitals (Joint Commission, HFAP) that could be similar channel partners?

11. The investment memo cited 2M analyses on 200K patient records in August. What's the current scale? And what % of new use cases leverage existing rules vs. require net-new rule creation?

**Virtue Support**

12. We offered GTM support (John Driscoll network, NYC sales talent, health system connections to Multicare, TGH, UT Southwestern, Kaiser, Cedars). What has Dart actually used? What would be most valuable now?

---

The 2026 plan is ambitious — $10M ARR via post-acute expansion plus a new hospital vertical. We're confident in the infrastructure and the post-acute motion. The questions above are about making sure the hospital playbook is clear before you scale into it.

Looking forward to the 15th.

*Internal notes (do not send):*
- Tone check: Direct but supportive. We're asking hard questions because we want them to succeed.
- Key thing to watch on call: Do they have a clear answer on oncology, or does it feel like they're still searching?
- If hiring is delayed, offer to make executive recruiter intros (True, Riviera, etc.)
