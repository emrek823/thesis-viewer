# 3M Health Care - Advisor & Director of Medical Economics at Community Health Systems Inc.

## Interview conducted on June 13, 2025

## Topics
Claims Repricing, Claims Engine, Provider Contracts, Medicare Fee Schedule, Pricing, Claims Adjudication, Unit Cost, Medicare

## Summary
The conversation between the Tegus Client and the expert focused on the expert's extensive background in Medicare and Medicaid pricing, specifically in the government business division. They discussed the importance of relativity in pricing claims and the use of software solutions like QNXT, Facets, HealthEdge, Milliman, and 3M. The expert emphasized the value of accurate pricing in reducing unit costs and optimizing provider contracts, contrasting it with the common focus on network integrity in the industry. Additionally, the conversation touched on the complexities of Medicare and Medicaid pricing, as well as the lack of transparency in methodologies used by vendors like Milliman and 3M, leading to frustration and a desire for alternative solutions.

## Expert Details

**Q: Have you ever repriced claims to Medicare rates using a third party vendor like Milliman or Wakely?**
A: Yes, my current plan, Community Health Choice, uses Milliman for pricing, pricing tells us "relativity" for a given provider or market. Just got off a call/presentation with them.

**Q: Are you familiar with the commercial structure for how you paid for claims to be repriced by third party vendor?**

A: Yes, because I did it in my prior job, so every claims engine has a medicare fee schedule, because people contract a percent of Medicare for the most part. They are joining our paid claims to get "relativity" from the provider.

## Client
I appreciate you taking the time to chat with me today. I'm looking to learn more about Medicare repricers. I saw your background coming, and I thought you had some really great background and experience specifically in that space. Maybe at a high level, if you could go over your background, that'd be great, and then we can dive in.

## Expert
Yeah. You're talking to the right guy. The unique thing about my background is I only did Medicare and Medicaid. I worked in five plans for 20 years. Three of those plans only did Medicare and Medicaid. Two had commercial, Highmark and Anthem, but I didn't touch it. I was in what they call government business division. I'll get into the pricing piece in a second and why we do that. We do it in Medicaid also. We use the term relativity. That's what we used at Anthem.

Now I went to another plan called Community Health Choice. They have Exchange, Medicare, and Medicaid. Those are the stuff that we do. We're smaller, but so far, so good. I worked in medical economics, and I paid 3M for pricing. At Anthem, we didn't pay anyone. Think about it. This is important, and this is what I'm trying to get community health plan.

We have to have a Medicare fee schedule in our claims engine because we contract a percent of Medicare. Why can't we pull paid claims and then compare that to the Medicare fee schedule that is loaded in our claims engine, which is QNXT? Health plans always use QNXT or Facets. Aetna Medicaid uses QNXT. We use QNXT here. Anthem Facets, Highmark Facets, AmeriHealth Caritas, I worked there five years, Facets.

Think about it. The Medicaid fee schedule to each state needs to be in there that we do Medicaid and Medicare because we contract a percent of Medicare. I always struggled with paying someone. We use Milliman at Community Health Choice, and I I can prove it to you if you want. The importance of pricing claims is this is where the value comes in. That's wonderful.

This is a perfect example. HCA of Florida, we have a contract 105% of Medicare. When you price out all their claims, it comes to 109%. You're going to say, "Well, still that doesn't make sense" because we had carve-outs on implants. Those carve-outs, we pay a flat amount that has nothing to do with Medicare. The overall relativity to HCA Florida for Anthem was 109%. It's not 105% because there are carve-outs, there's all these things. That helps us compare providers.

What is Tampa General at? What is HCA coming in at? The bigger the spend with the hospital, the higher the relativity, the greater impact it has to your market P&L, like getting an A in a five-credit hour class in college versus an A in a two. HCA Florida is a massive impact. Children's Hospital of Atlanta, massive impact. Relativity is true. You've got your hospital contract, that's one thing, and then there's what you're paid. You could have loaded the contract wrong. There could be modifiers. There can be carve-outs.

A large urology practice in Maryland, five codes they had carved out. Their relativity was fairly high. We'll get to further details, but I wanted to lay the groundwork of why it's used or using it to profile our provider saying, "Their overall relativity is this. This guy's is that," and have network ops go out and either recontract or bring in a provider at a lower unit cost. We have a relativity at a market level.

## Client
That's perfect. This is exactly what I'm looking to learn more about. You mentioned 3M. You also mentioned QNXT and Facets. I know that HealthEdge is also in this gaps space. I don't know if you're familiar with HealthEdge.

I use them. They're my medical management platform. They have a claims engine, but I used HealthEdge so long that it used to be called Altruista. HealthEdge bought Altruista. I use them as my medical management platform. I want you to think there are two sides of the house. There's medical management, which is case management, prior auth and current review, appeals and grievances. That's under the doc.

Over in operations, you've got claims config, enrollment, member services. HealthEdge is more known in the medical management side of the house. Yes, and they do have a pricing. It's just like Facets and QNXT, those are claims engines. That's owned by Cognizant. Every health plan is using pretty much one of those two solutions to adjudicate their claims.

## Client
When you say medical management, is that going to also start to overlap with the MCG and InterQual?

## Expert
That's prior auth. That's what you just said. That's Milliman Care Guide and InterQual are the solutions we use for prior auth. A nice term is medical necessity. All of that is under the chief medical officer. Everywhere I worked, we used InterQual except Anthem. They didn't use it. InterQual's better. That's a McKesson solution. All that's in medical management.

The pricing is what I do. When a claim adjudicates, it actually prices it out. A lot of these cancer drugs, it's a physical health benefit. It comes into the claims engine, it's going to say, "Okay, how are we contracted with this provider?" ASP+6%. That's done in ops when it adjudicates the claim.

What I do is I pull paid claims and I'll run it through a pricer, or I'll have somebody manually price it. Providers do this too, by the way. Rev cycle is their version of claims. When they say rev cycle, it's the same thing as my claim. They're pricing it out to see their reimbursement amongst health plans because comparing contracts doesn't mean anything. It's, at the end of the day, what was paid.

## Client
Yeah. Maybe circling back to the pricing workflow itself, you just said that you have TriZetto and Facets, but then you're also using 3M. You're also, in some cases, using Milliman. Is there a reason why those other vendors are also being used in addition to TriZetto and Facets that could do the same thing?

## Expert
Excellent question. TriZetto and Facets is the claims engine. They're not doing the analytics. Now, this always confused me, keep in mind we have to have a Medicare fee schedule in there to adjudicate claims. I never understood why we couldn't get that out of QNXT or Facets. Now, what Milliman and 3M and all those guys give us, they are not a software. Facets and QNXT, it's pretty much to me the claims engine.

Milliman and 3M are not adjudicating claims. They're taking paid claims, and this is what they do for facility. They're going to say, "Okay, for inpatient, relativity is, let's say 105%. For outpatient, it came in at 107%, and then for this provider, overall relativity is 106%." The utilization is more with outpatient than inpatient. That's what they give us at a tax ID level. A report to, say, Atrium, North Carolina, your Medicare members or your Medicare spent to Atrium came in at 105% of Medicare.

Facets isn't doing that. It's just paying claims. QNXT is paying claims. All that engine is doing is we have to load provider contracts. That's called configuration, when we load benefits, contracts, enrollment, all that. What Milliman and 3M are doing is taking paid claims.

My department did this at Anthem. We didn't buy a solution. We calculated our own relativity. My employees did to give us that relativity. Other companies pay for it, we pay for it. We don't have the capacity to do it. We have under one million lives. We're not as big. That's really the difference.

I want you to think Facets and QNXT is a software we pay a lot of money for. It's hosted, usually at the helm. Johns Hopkins, they own a health plan. They outsource their claims to Facets. They use Facets as their TPA, which makes sense. They're selling their claims engine, they could be a TPA.

tegus by AlphaSense Page 3 of 8

I want you to think of that more as software versus Milliman and 3M. 3M does have software because I've used it. I want you to think of it more of their taking the paid claims and pricing out, versus Facets is getting data from the clearinghouse and then they price it looking at contracts and other stuff to auto adjudicate.

## Client
Got it. Maybe on that note of actually using 3M or Milliman to reprice claims, how often is that happening? What is the workflow? Are you taking one million claims, 10 million claims flowing through the repricer engines at Milliman?

## Expert
They're doing it. Now, when I did it at Anthem, we had tables that we joined to and then obviously there are certain fields in our data warehouse that made it easy for us. There'll be a dollar amount of what straight Medicare would pay. By the way, we do this in our Exchange business. It's just a higher percent of Medicare, I'll say like 145%, 170%. It's a way for us to compare providers. "Hey this guy's coming in 170%." We do this in professional PCPs and specialists, more so specialists. PCPs, their whole thing is of value-based payment, and then on the facility side, inpatient, outpatient.

The reason why we use the Medicare fee schedule is it level sets. We can easily say this guy's 175%. We do it in our exchange business too. We're doing them the same thing. I just had Milliman do our exchange business repricing. For a given market, it said 145%, which tells me that if we go out and contract with people, we want it to be below 145%. That reduces overall unit cost. I had to explain that to our CFO that that's the aim here.

Once you know your relativity, the water level, you want to bring new providers in that are below that. Now, you might not contract a percent of Medicare, but what you want to do is crosswalk however you contract into a percent of Medicare that's below 145% that reduces unit costs. That's really the value prop. Everyone that sells to health plans, like this is Zelis and Quest and J3, all they're doing is network integrity. That is not a huge value prop.

What you and I are talking about is huge value prop. In a health plan, our levers are utilization, unit cost, revenue. That's it. This whole network integrity thing, if we don't have network integrity, CMS will tell us, and then we just add some providers. My team can calculate that by counting distinct provider tax ID by a specialty, by county to say, "There are ways we can get it." Not that I do a ton of these calls. Everybody wants to talk about Quest and J3. It's like, that small pricing is important. Nobody wants to hear that stuff you're asking. It's legitimate. That's real, but nobody goes there.

## Client
Yeah. I'm curious as you go through some of these projects, let's say you're repricing a certain market, how does Milliman charge you? Is it on a per claim basis? Is it a flat fee?

## Expert
It's weird. We use them pretty heavily here, and next year we won't. That's what my boss told me. We use them for our bids. A lot of the pricing with them is going to be a function of how much you use them for. I would say, believe, if you're going to give them a market it could run, about $200,000, $250,000.

## Client
Just for repricing claims?

## Expert
Yeah.

## Client
Wow. I had no idea. Technically, some of these repricers are available through Medicare. Am I wrong?

## Expert
Yeah. Here's the problem. You go to the Medicare website, and the problem is it's one code at a time. Plus, it's way more complicated than that. If it's a teaching hospital, there are a lot of components to this. I have a friend that actually did. There are a lot of components. If it's a teaching hospital, their 100% of Medicare is not the same as 100% of Medicare down the street.

I'm owned by a health system called Harris Health. Every one of our inpatient claims, the payer gets hit with an extra $100,000. That's insane. That's called the DSH payment, and that's because the health system has an inordinate amount of members that show up without insurance. The members that do show up with insurance, they get that health plan, that payer gets crushed. That's still 100% of Medicare. You got to know, is it a teaching hospital? All kinds of things, it varies by what's called a CCN number. There are nuances to it, that whole thing.

## Client
Got it. You said you've also used 3M. How does 3M's pricing vary if you're looking to get a batch of claims repriced? Is it also like you're sending those claims over to 3M, or do you have access to a tool or software?

## Expert
We actually host it. We host it at the health plan. The only time we send stuff to them is to flag our preventables, which to me is silly also. 3M, it was hosted. More and more things are not hosted at the health plan. I have issue with that due to security. It's a huge risk.

Our quality at Anthem, we're sending them all the data. That's insane for the heat of stuff like that. should be hosted at the health plan, but I'm sure 3M could do either. When I was at WellCare and other plans, we had it. We had one desktop computer dedicated to pricing and then we paid a license for that.

## Client
I see. Do you know what the 3M license will look like for repricing? I don't know if it gets split up into modules or not or if it's the whole thing together.

## Expert
We don't like to do a PMPM because as we grow, that shouldn't result in more revenue for 3M. They're not doing anything different, and running more stuff through their solution doesn't increase their overhead. If we do a PMPM, it's going to be between zero and one million members. That can be about $140,000, maybe.

SAS had something that was $140,000 also when I was at AmeriHealth. We used 3M when I was at WellCare. That's a ways back. Centene owns WellCare now. I would look at it that way. The thing about repricing is you need to get the data back either aggregated at a provider tax ID level. That way you can really say this guy's coming up 150%.

## Client
Yeah. Let me ask you this. Do you think there is an opportunity for a vendor to create an offering that allows you to upload a batch of claims, get it repriced, and that's the core product offering? Is there value in that?

## Expert
I'd say yes, because it's driving our network decisions. The contract only tells you so much. I can tell you we had contracts with an Hospital of Atlanta. Here's the thing, once you have carve-outs, there's a ton of volume with that. For example, L.A. Women's Care, same thing. Any lab work had a ridiculous reimbursement. Pricing is important in both Medicare, Medicaid. In Medicaid, the only problem is each state has a fee schedule. You got to pull that down and do that whole thing.

The short answer, I'd say, yes. Keep in mind, then you got Cotiviti on the front end who gets our paid claims. They're doing some pricing because they're telling us what to short pay or deny, and then the following morning we get that from them and then pay based off that. Are they doing some pricing? What are they necessarily on? That's an operations function because that's part of the whole claims payment.

tegus by AlphaSense Page 5 of 8

To me, they're best positioned to do that because they're already doing some logic too. The short answer that you're looking for, yes, there's a need for because it'll tell us at the end of the day and it helps us level set, get that water level I keep saying. The short answer is yes, whether it's uploaded or we just do data BAA agreement and then share the data with you.

The best thing to do it is every six months. Anthem did it like twice a month, and it was silly because relativity isn't going to change because your provider contracts don't. Your contracts aren't changing, so why would relativity at a provider level change? Your market relativity might change. You have more utilization going to Robert Wood Johnson this year versus whatever. If your utilization mixes, you've got more people going to provider A versus B, that'll change relativity in a given market, but at a provider level, which is the real way you want it, semiannually is the way to go.

I would just have the health plan give you the data, you price it out, and then you basically say, "These providers are coming in at this, this, this, and this." The contracts don't change, so why do I need to go back to you to tell me something that you already told me? A market will change over time because members are going to UPenn, all of a sudden they're going to Crozer. That'll reduce market relativity, but at a provider level, nothing changed.

## Client
In the case of Milliman, would you be sending out a claims file maybe once every six months and have it repriced to Medicare?

## Expert
I'm not even sure how frequent they do it here. Other organizations, we looked at relativity semiannually or quarterly, but the best way to really do it is just pay someone quarterly or semiannually to reprice our claims. Like I said, the real use is for our network ops. We called it PSO at Anthem, provider services, but every health plan calls it network ops or provider relations. For them to say, "Okay, I can kick this guy out there, have a high relativity, or if I bring new people in," it's really used to control unit cost, which is one of our three most important levers.

## Client
When you think about it, either like sending it out to somebody like Milliman or doing it on a software like 3M that you have, is there a preference in terms of how you look at it? What's the best way to go about doing a repricing exercise?

## Expert
It depends on the plan. At Anthem, we did it internally. My team did it. There were some things we couldn't price out. We called that relativity. That's a term I learned, where for provider, for facility, let's just pick Children's Hospital of Atlanta, we had a relativity for inpatient, one for outpatient, total relativity. I don't have a preference necessarily, but I think plans should be able to do this because we're uploading a Medicare fee schedule into our claims. Why can't we somehow join to that? We did that at Anthem in Teradata, they're now on Snowflake. Why can't we join to that and then get the delta by provider tax ID? That's our relativity.

I always get in every health plan I go to, "Oh, no, it's not that simple." Where I'm like, "Well, what do you mean it's not? It's got to be in there because how else are you adjudicating claims? It's got to be." I don't have a preference. I just know that Anthem made a big deal out of this. They loved looking at this. We refreshed it twice a month, which is insane. Provider contracts don't change. Now, a market relativity does. Members are going to different places, so the market relativity is going to move around. For what it's really intended for, quarterly to semiannually.

Now, if utilization with a provider goes up, who has carve-outs? That's common. DME vendors, G1056. Whenever a vendor gets a carve-out, that utilization is run away. It's good. I don't have a preference, to be honest with you. I just think that I'm confused on why more plans actually can't do it in-house when these fee schedules have to be loaded. I don't have a preference.

Yeah. I'm curious, when you think about the spend involved with Milliman, because there's some consulting involved in addition to the tools,.

## Expert
It's going to be cheaper internally. I'll tell you why. We already have an analytics team. We already have that. It would just be part of their workflow and daily responsibility. It would have to be cheaper internally. Even if we hired one employee and that's all they did, it's still cheaper.

## Client
Yeah. Is that spend something that is meaningful? Is that spend something that teams you've been part of are like, "That's money"?

## Expert
Too small, yeah. You can go one way or the other. Usually it's a function of they're doing something else for us, and then we give them a pricing type thing. Like I said at Anthem, we didn't outsource it, but other places we did. My current employer, we're using Milliman, but we're smaller. We have under one million lives. We don't have the capacity to do it. We're also using Milliman for our bid submission, which I think just went out yesterday. It's due every June to CMS for your Medicare members and then open enrollment October. We're using them for a couple things, and I think that's the reason why that is.

## Client
Yeah. What do you make of, Milliman says that they built the GRVU system that maybe goes beyond what Medicare can do and there's value in looking at stuff that Medicare can't reprice just through straight Medicare? Some of the GRVU methodologies that Milliman has built has built are unique and as such.

## Expert
My boss has a problem with that because they won't share the methodology. My boss is an actuary, and that's one of the reasons why he wants to term them, but then it's like, "We'll give you that for less than $15,000," I think. My boss is an actuary. He didn't work there. He came from Cigna. There is that black box, if you will. I think he's trying to get that. That is a sticking point with him. For me, that's all these companies, 3M wouldn't give me their logic. In flagging preventables now, I could work backwards. A lot of people use 3M for the preventables, PPV, PPR, all of that stuff. To me, that's a waste of money if you want to talk about something. That is an issue, I'd say, he has.

## Client
Yeah. A vendor that is offering a repricing solution, but then is also really transparent about what that repricing methodology.

## Expert
Think of it this way. My CFO wants me to back into those edits that Cotiviti is using from the return files. We can load that into QNXT and cut off Cotiviti. It's a similar thing. She's asked me to do that. Day one, I was in the elevator with her. It's just like 3M is not going to tell me what they're using to flag. Johns Hopkins has their ACG, whatever, so none of these people are going to tell you that. You can try and back into it. Truth be told, there are free things out there for that. You've got the NYU Wagner model for preventables. That's close enough.

## Client
Interesting. I appreciate all of the color that you added. Really helpful. Thank you so much.
