## Slide 4: OPPORTUNITY

Dental insurance is a $150B+ market built on a legacy tech stack & manual workflows

~17% ($5 pmpm) of every dental premium ($30 pmpm) spent on admin expenses due to:
- Antiquated tech
- Manual workflows
- Low electronic adoption

**U.S. Dental Service Spend Growth**
- **2024E U.S. Dental Service Spend:** $156B
- **2030E U.S. Dental Service Spend:** $216B
- **CAGR:** 6.8%

## Slide 5: WHY NOW

Dental insurers must automate back-end tasks to improve margins due to recent regulatory pressures & market dynamics

**REGULATORY & MARKET PRESSURES ARE FORCING AUTOMATION**
- **Impending mandated dental loss ratios**
    - As of 2025 in Mass, >83% of premium must go to care (vs.70% typically). Other states are expected to emulate as happened with medical. This would require payers to cut admin expenses to maintain margins while continuing to offer competitive premiums and benefits offerings
- **Competitive dental plans required to win market share**
    - 88% of Americans have dental insurance and >90% of MA plans (50M members) offer a dental benefit. Insurers (e.g., CVS/Aetna, Humana) are forced to reduce admin costs for dental benefits to continue to offer competitive benefits to attract members who see dental as a differentiator (#2 benefit after medical)
- **Value-based care requires more benefits integration**
    - Medical-dental integration is starting to show effective outcomes (Kaiser, BCBS), driving adoption of more complex plan design and increased spend on manual admin resources

**BUT CARRIERS/DSOS STRUGGLE TO BUILD OR BUY AI SOLUTIONS**
- **Carriers / DSOs are actively looking for AI solutions**
    - Insurers and providers have historically leveraged AI/ML for image analysis (~20% of claims require image analysis) but now want to leverage advances in LLMs to impact the other 80% of claims/interactions
- **Build: customers don't have human capital to build internally**
    - Carriers/DSOs fundamentally cannot build product internally because they are unable to attract engineering talent required to implement novel technology solutions, especially AI. <1% of dental insurance organizations have built internal team for AI initiatives
- **Buy: existing vendors lack dental AND AI expertise**
    - Existing dental specific platforms are antiquated, cumbersome and costly, (>$100M over 5 years per payer), while more general insuretech platforms aren't purpose built for dental - resulting in lower accuracy/automation for dental workflows

## Slide 6: PROBLEM

Carriers / DSOs losing massive revenue due to manual workflows

| Category     | Human intervention in adjudicating claims (30% manual today) | 15% - 30% paper claims intake                  | 60 - 90 days to credential & onboard providers                   | High average handle times (>5 mins) & low first call resolution (60%) |
| :----------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Challenges** |                                                              |                                                |                                                                  |                                                                       |
| **32H Product** | 32Health’s AI claim adjudication eliminates manual intervention in adjudication | AI claims intake automation for non-electronic claims | 32Health’s AI credentialing product ensures accuracy in credentialing with NCQA standards | Omni channel call experience using 32Health’s AI virtual agents       |
| **ROI**      | 90% Auto adjudication rate                                   | 94% In manual claims processing                | 90% Providers credentialed in real time                          | 75% In provider call costs                                            |
