**Created:** 2025-12-18T20:00:25.681Z
**Updated:** 2025-12-18T21:50:11.887Z

### Scheduling and Logistics

- Meeting rescheduled to 5pm Central (3 hours from original time)
	- Bobby held up in transit after 2 weeks of travel
	- Tomorrow’s family commitment prevented evening alternative
- Draft memo already sent to Bobby for review ahead of meeting

### Fund Performance and Portfolio Updates

- Q3 2025 marks: 1.7x TVPI, 29% net IRR (34-35% gross)
	- Recent markdowns: Hero Journey written to zero (proactive decision)
	- Q4 expected markdowns across portfolio for conservative approach
- Recent funding rounds completed:
	- Anna Health: $17.5M Series A term sheet (not yet wired)
	- Translucent: Series A at 4-4.5x seed valuation
	- Prudentia: Series A at 3.5-4x seed valuation
	- Hermes: $4M seed at $18M post (from $5M post initial)
- Pipeline developments:
	- Solstice: Most asked-about company, expecting $12-15M Series A
	- Standard Model Bio: Series A in Q1, potentially $20-50M round
	- Integral: Series B expected before year-end

### Fund II Strategy and Check Sizing

- Current fund size constraints creating competitive challenges
	- $50-55M fund difficult to execute in today’s seed market
	- Leading 75% of deals but constrained by check size limitations
- Target ownership evolution:
	- Moving from 10% to 15% initial ownership
	- Strategy: aggressive upfront capital deployment vs. waiting for Series A
	- Example: Anna Health - 12% at pre-seed, doubled down to 22-23% total ownership
- Check size increase rationale:

### Healthcare Sector Positioning

- Strategic rotation away from care delivery (started 2.5 years ago)
	- Series A/B market sentiment extremely tough for care delivery
	- Oak HC/FT and Transformation Capital reducing care delivery focus
- Portfolio concentration in pharma tech and AI-enabled healthcare
	- Differentiating factor vs. healthcare generalists
	- Anticipating where growth market will move next
- Competitive advantage in technical diligence
	- Founders increasingly seeking brand pedigree (Sequoia, a16z) over healthcare-specific VCs at Series A
	- Healthcare VCs lacking technical skills for AI-native companies

### Guide Investment Case Study

- $500K investment at $75M post (started at $30-35M, bidding war to $75M)
- Exception to typical strategy due to:
	- 5-year relationship with founder Will
	- Learning from two prior high-priced passes (now marked at $1B and $650M)
	- Series A at $250M - considering SPV participation but logistically challenging before Christmas
- Investment philosophy: aggressive early positions in quality companies vs. sourcing for others

**Updated:** 2025-12-18T17:45:06.021Z

### Proposed Structure Overview

- Hank (Flex by Fenwick) proposed Virtue invest in GPV fund as fund-of-funds
	- Only requires LPAC consents on both sides
	- Virtue waives 20% single investment cap
	- Sean becomes GP of GPV fund
- Sarah (Morrison & Foerster) raised concerns
	- Departure from Virtue’s investment strategy
	- Creates flow-through rights issues for LPs
	- Securities law complications with fund-of-funds structure

### Alternative Structures Discussed

- Keep funds separate with co-investment agreement
	- Contract between two funds defining investment allocation
	- Maintains existing fund terms for all LPs
	- Addresses parallel investment opportunities systematically
	- Avoids new LPA requirements
- Combined co-investment vehicle option
	- Each fund contributes to new managed entity
	- More complex with additional flow-through concerns
	- Creates similar issues to fund-of-funds approach

### Consent Requirements Analysis

- Management company changes require LP consent under Advisers Act
	- Both funds need new combined management company
	- GPV has third-party investor in management company requiring advisory committee approval
- Time commitment provisions create potential conflicts
	- Both funds require substantial time devotion from managers
	- Co-investment structure may address allocation concerns
- Parallel fund designation ruled out
	- Fee schedules and carry structures differ between funds
	- Terms must be identical for true parallel fund status

### Next Steps

- Incorporate agreed structure into MOU
	- JS and Stephanie to draft revisions
	- New management company formation
	- LP consents for management change and co-investment agreement
- Sean to coordinate with portfolio company issue, then connect later today
- Both GPs to be appointed to each fund for consistency

### Scheduling and Logistics

- Meeting rescheduled to 5pm Central (3 hours from original time)
	- Bobby held up in transit after 2 weeks of travel
	- Tomorrow’s family commitment prevented evening alternative
- Draft memo already sent to Bobby for review ahead of meeting

### Fund Performance and Portfolio Updates

- Q3 2025 marks: 1.7x TVPI, 29% net IRR (34-35% gross)
	- Recent markdowns: Hero Journey written to zero (proactive decision)
	- Q4 expected markdowns across portfolio for conservative approach
- Recent funding rounds completed:
	- Anna Health: $17.5M Series A term sheet (not yet wired)
	- Translucent: Series A at 4-4.5x seed valuation
	- Prudentia: Series A at 3.5-4x seed valuation
	- Hermes: $4M seed at $18M post (from $5M post initial)
- Pipeline developments:
	- Solstice: Most asked-about company, expecting $12-15M Series A
	- Standard Model Bio: Series A in Q1, potentially $20-50M round
	- Integral: Series B expected before year-end

### Fund II Strategy and Check Sizing

- Current fund size constraints creating competitive challenges
	- $50-55M fund difficult to execute in today’s seed market
	- Leading 75% of deals but constrained by check size limitations
- Target ownership evolution:
	- Moving from 10% to 15% initial ownership
	- Strategy: aggressive upfront capital deployment vs. waiting for Series A
	- Example: Anna Health - 12% at pre-seed, doubled down to 22-23% total ownership
- Check size increase rationale:

### Healthcare Sector Positioning

- Strategic rotation away from care delivery (started 2.5 years ago)
	- Series A/B market sentiment extremely tough for care delivery
	- Oak HC/FT and Transformation Capital reducing care delivery focus
- Portfolio concentration in pharma tech and AI-enabled healthcare
	- Differentiating factor vs. healthcare generalists
	- Anticipating where growth market will move next
- Competitive advantage in technical diligence
	- Founders increasingly seeking brand pedigree (Sequoia, a16z) over healthcare-specific VCs at Series A
	- Healthcare VCs lacking technical skills for AI-native companies

### Guide Investment Case Study

- $500K investment at $75M post (started at $30-35M, bidding war to $75M)
- Exception to typical strategy due to:
	- 5-year relationship with founder Will
	- Learning from two prior high-priced passes (now marked at $1B and $650M)
	- Series A at $250M - considering SPV participation but logistically challenging before Christmas
- Investment philosophy: aggressive early positions in quality companies vs. sourcing for others

**Updated:** 2025-12-18T17:45:06.021Z

### Proposed Structure Overview

- Hank (Flex by Fenwick) proposed Virtue invest in GPV fund as fund-of-funds
	- Only requires LPAC consents on both sides
	- Virtue waives 20% single investment cap
	- Sean becomes GP of GPV fund
- Sarah (Morrison & Foerster) raised concerns
	- Departure from Virtue’s investment strategy
	- Creates flow-through rights issues for LPs
	- Securities law complications with fund-of-funds structure

### Alternative Structures Discussed

- Keep funds separate with co-investment agreement
	- Contract between two funds defining investment allocation
	- Maintains existing fund terms for all LPs
	- Addresses parallel investment opportunities systematically
	- Avoids new LPA requirements
- Combined co-investment vehicle option
	- Each fund contributes to new managed entity
	- More complex with additional flow-through concerns
	- Creates similar issues to fund-of-funds approach

### Consent Requirements Analysis

- Management company changes require LP consent under Advisers Act
	- Both funds need new combined management company
	- GPV has third-party investor in management company requiring advisory committee approval
- Time commitment provisions create potential conflicts
	- Both funds require substantial time devotion from managers
	- Co-investment structure may address allocation concerns
- Parallel fund designation ruled out
	- Fee schedules and carry structures differ between funds
	- Terms must be identical for true parallel fund status

### Next Steps

- Incorporate agreed structure into MOU
	- JS and Stephanie to draft revisions
	- New management company formation
	- LP consents for management change and co-investment agreement
- Sean to coordinate with portfolio company issue, then connect later today
- Both GPs to be appointed to each fund for consistency

### Scheduling and Logistics

- Meeting rescheduled to 5pm Central (3 hours from original time)
	- Bobby held up in transit after 2 weeks of travel
	- Tomorrow’s family commitment prevented evening alternative
- Draft memo already sent to Bobby for review ahead of meeting

### Fund Performance and Portfolio Updates

- Q3 2025 marks: 1.7x TVPI, 29% net IRR (34-35% gross)
	- Recent markdowns: Hero Journey written to zero (proactive decision)
	- Q4 expected markdowns across portfolio for conservative approach
- Recent funding rounds completed:
	- Anna Health: $17.5M Series A term sheet (not yet wired)
	- Translucent: Series A at 4-4.5x seed valuation
	- Prudentia: Series A at 3.5-4x seed valuation
	- Hermes: $4M seed at $18M post (from $5M post initial)
- Pipeline developments:
	- Solstice: Most asked-about company, expecting $12-15M Series A
	- Standard Model Bio: Series A in Q1, potentially $20-50M round
	- Integral: Series B expected before year-end

### Fund II Strategy and Check Sizing

- Current fund size constraints creating competitive challenges
	- $50-55M fund difficult to execute in today’s seed market
	- Leading 75% of deals but constrained by check size limitations
- Target ownership evolution:
	- Moving from 10% to 15% initial ownership
	- Strategy: aggressive upfront capital deployment vs. waiting for Series A
	- Example: Anna Health - 12% at pre-seed, doubled down to 22-23% total ownership
- Check size increase rationale:

### Healthcare Sector Positioning

- Strategic rotation away from care delivery (started 2.5 years ago)
	- Series A/B market sentiment extremely tough for care delivery
	- Oak HC/FT and Transformation Capital reducing care delivery focus
- Portfolio concentration in pharma tech and AI-enabled healthcare
	- Differentiating factor vs. healthcare generalists
	- Anticipating where growth market will move next
- Competitive advantage in technical diligence
	- Founders increasingly seeking brand pedigree (Sequoia, a16z) over healthcare-specific VCs at Series A
	- Healthcare VCs lacking technical skills for AI-native companies

### Guide Investment Case Study

- $500K investment at $75M post (started at $30-35M, bidding war to $75M)
- Exception to typical strategy due to:
	- 5-year relationship with founder Will
	- Learning from two prior high-priced passes (now marked at $1B and $650M)
	- Series A at $250M - considering SPV participation but logistically challenging before Christmas
- Investment philosophy: aggressive early positions in quality companies vs. sourcing for others

**Updated:** 2025-12-18T17:45:06.021Z

### Proposed Structure Overview

- Hank (Flex by Fenwick) proposed Virtue invest in GPV fund as fund-of-funds
	- Only requires LPAC consents on both sides
	- Virtue waives 20% single investment cap
	- Sean becomes GP of GPV fund
- Sarah (Morrison & Foerster) raised concerns
	- Departure from Virtue’s investment strategy
	- Creates flow-through rights issues for LPs
	- Securities law complications with fund-of-funds structure

### Alternative Structures Discussed

- Keep funds separate with co-investment agreement
	- Contract between two funds defining investment allocation
	- Maintains existing fund terms for all LPs
	- Addresses parallel investment opportunities systematically
	- Avoids new LPA requirements
- Combined co-investment vehicle option
	- Each fund contributes to new managed entity
	- More complex with additional flow-through concerns
	- Creates similar issues to fund-of-funds approach

### Consent Requirements Analysis

- Management company changes require LP consent under Advisers Act
	- Both funds need new combined management company
	- GPV has third-party investor in management company requiring advisory committee approval
- Time commitment provisions create potential conflicts
	- Both funds require substantial time devotion from managers
	- Co-investment structure may address allocation concerns
- Parallel fund designation ruled out
	- Fee schedules and carry structures differ between funds
	- Terms must be identical for true parallel fund status

### Next Steps

- Incorporate agreed structure into MOU
	- JS and Stephanie to draft revisions
	- New management company formation

- Sean to coordinate with portfolio company issue, then connect later today

### Scheduling and Logistics

- Meeting rescheduled to 5pm Central (3 hours from original time)
	- Bobby held up in transit after 2 weeks of travel
	- Tomorrow’s family commitment prevented evening alternative
- Draft memo already sent to Bobby for review ahead of meeting

### Fund Performance and Portfolio Updates

- Q3 2025 marks: 1.7x TVPI, 29% net IRR (34-35% gross)
	- Recent markdowns: Hero Journey written to zero (proactive decision)
	- Q4 expected markdowns across portfolio for conservative approach
- Recent funding rounds completed:
	- Anna Health: $17.5M Series A term sheet (not yet wired)
	- Translucent: Series A at 4-4.5x seed valuation
	- Prudentia: Series A at 3.5-4x seed valuation
	- Hermes: $4M seed at $18M post (from $5M post initial)
- Pipeline developments:
	- Solstice: Most asked-about company, expecting $12-15M Series A
	- Standard Model Bio: Series A in Q1, potentially $20-50M round
	- Integral: Series B expected before year-end

### Fund II Strategy and Check Sizing

- Current fund size constraints creating competitive challenges
	- $50-55M fund difficult to execute in today’s seed market
	- Leading 75% of deals but constrained by check size limitations
- Target ownership evolution:
	- Moving from 10% to 15% initial ownership
	- Strategy: aggressive upfront capital deployment vs. waiting for Series A
	- Example: Anna Health - 12% at pre-seed, doubled down to 22-23% total ownership
- Check size increase rationale:

### Healthcare Sector Positioning

- Strategic rotation away from care delivery (started 2.5 years ago)
	- Series A/B market sentiment extremely tough for care delivery
	- Oak HC/FT and Transformation Capital reducing care delivery focus
- Portfolio concentration in pharma tech and AI-enabled healthcare
	- Differentiating factor vs. healthcare generalists
	- Anticipating where growth market will move next
- Competitive advantage in technical diligence
	- Founders increasingly seeking brand pedigree (Sequoia, a16z) over healthcare-specific VCs at Series A
	- Healthcare VCs lacking technical skills for AI-native companies

### Guide Investment Case Study

- $500K investment at $75M post (started at $30-35M, bidding war to $75M)
- Exception to typical strategy due to:
	- 5-year relationship with founder Will
	- Learning from two prior high-priced passes (now marked at $1B and $650M)
	- Series A at $250M - considering SPV participation but logistically challenging before Christmas
- Investment philosophy: aggressive early positions in quality companies vs. sourcing for others

### Scheduling and Logistics

- Meeting rescheduled to 5pm Central (3 hours from original time)
	- Bobby held up in transit after 2 weeks of travel
	- Tomorrow’s family commitment prevented evening alternative
- Draft memo already sent to Bobby for review ahead of meeting

### Fund Performance and Portfolio Updates

- Q3 2025 marks: 1.7x TVPI, 29% net IRR (34-35% gross)
	- Recent markdowns: Hero Journey written to zero (proactive decision)
	- Q4 expected markdowns across portfolio for conservative approach
- Recent funding rounds completed:
	- Anna Health: $17.5M Series A term sheet (not yet wired)
	- Translucent: Series A at 4-4.5x seed valuation
	- Prudentia: Series A at 3.5-4x seed valuation
	- Hermes: $4M seed at $18M post (from $5M post initial)
- Pipeline developments:
	- Solstice: Most asked-about company, expecting $12-15M Series A
	- Standard Model Bio: Series A in Q1, potentially $20-50M round
	- Integral: Series B expected before year-end

### Fund II Strategy and Check Sizing

- Current fund size constraints creating competitive challenges
	- $50-55M fund difficult to execute in today’s seed market
	- Leading 75% of deals but constrained by check size limitations
- Target ownership evolution:
	- Moving from 10% to 15% initial ownership
	- Strategy: aggressive upfront capital deployment vs. waiting for Series A
	- Example: Anna Health - 12% at pre-seed, doubled down to 22-23% total ownership
- Check size increase rationale:

### Healthcare Sector Positioning

- Strategic rotation away from care delivery (started 2.5 years ago)
	- Series A/B market sentiment extremely tough for care delivery
	- Oak HC/FT and Transformation Capital reducing care delivery focus
- Portfolio concentration in pharma tech and AI-enabled healthcare
	- Differentiating factor vs. healthcare generalists
	- Anticipating where growth market will move next
- Competitive advantage in technical diligence
	- Founders increasingly seeking brand pedigree (Sequoia, a16z) over healthcare-specific VCs at Series A
	- Healthcare VCs lacking technical skills for AI-native companies

### Guide Investment Case Study

- $500K investment at $75M post (started at $30-35M, bidding war to $75M)
- Exception to typical strategy due to:
	- 5-year relationship with founder Will
	- Learning from two prior high-priced passes (now marked at $1B and $650M)
	- Series A at $250M - considering SPV participation but logistically challenging before Christmas
- Investment philosophy: aggressive early positions in quality companies vs. sourcing for others

### Scheduling and Logistics

- Meeting rescheduled to 5pm Central (3 hours from original time)
	- Bobby held up in transit after 2 weeks of travel
	- Tomorrow’s family commitment prevented evening alternative
- Draft memo already sent to Bobby for review ahead of meeting

### Fund Performance and Portfolio Updates

- Q3 2025 marks: 1.7x TVPI, 29% net IRR (34-35% gross)
	- Recent markdowns: Hero Journey written to zero (proactive decision)
	- Q4 expected markdowns across portfolio for conservative approach
- Recent funding rounds completed:
	- Anna Health: $17.5M Series A term sheet (not yet wired)
	- Translucent: Series A at 4-4.5x seed valuation
	- Prudentia: Series A at 3.5-4x seed valuation
	- Hermes: $4M seed at $18M post (from $5M post initial)
- Pipeline developments:
	- Solstice: Most asked-about company, expecting $12-15M Series A
	- Standard Model Bio: Series A in Q1, potentially $20-50M round
	- Integral: Series B expected before year-end

### Fund II Strategy and Check Sizing

- Current fund size constraints creating competitive challenges
	- $50-55M fund difficult to execute in today’s seed market
	- Leading 75% of deals but constrained by check size limitations
- Target ownership evolution:
	- Moving from 10% to 15% initial ownership
	- Strategy: aggressive upfront capital deployment vs. waiting for Series A
	- Example: Anna Health - 12% at pre-seed, doubled down to 22-23% total ownership
- Check size increase rationale:

### Healthcare Sector Positioning

- Strategic rotation away from care delivery (started 2.5 years ago)
	- Series A/B market sentiment extremely tough for care delivery
	- Oak HC/FT and Transformation Capital reducing care delivery focus
- Portfolio concentration in pharma tech and AI-enabled healthcare
	- Differentiating factor vs. healthcare generalists
	- Anticipating where growth market will move next
- Competitive advantage in technical diligence
	- Founders increasingly seeking brand pedigree (Sequoia, a16z) over healthcare-specific VCs at Series A
	- Healthcare VCs lacking technical skills for AI-native companies

### Guide Investment Case Study

- $500K investment at $75M post (started at $30-35M, bidding war to $75M)
- Exception to typical strategy due to:
	- 5-year relationship with founder Will
	- Learning from two prior high-priced passes (now marked at $1B and $650M)
	- Series A at $250M - considering SPV participation but logistically challenging before Christmas
- Investment philosophy: aggressive early positions in quality companies vs. sourcing for others

### Scheduling and Logistics

- Meeting rescheduled to 5pm Central (3 hours from original time)
	- Bobby held up in transit after 2 weeks of travel
	- Tomorrow’s family commitment prevented evening alternative
- Draft memo already sent to Bobby for review ahead of meeting

### Fund Performance and Portfolio Updates

- Q3 2025 marks: 1.7x TVPI, 29% net IRR (34-35% gross)
	- Recent markdowns: Hero Journey written to zero (proactive decision)
	- Q4 expected markdowns across portfolio for conservative approach
- Recent funding rounds completed:
	- Anna Health: $17.5M Series A term sheet (not yet wired)
	- Translucent: Series A at 4-4.5x seed valuation
	- Prudentia: Series A at 3.5-4x seed valuation
	- Hermes: $4M seed at $18M post (from $5M post initial)
- Pipeline developments:
	- Solstice: Most asked-about company, expecting $12-15M Series A
	- Standard Model Bio: Series A in Q1, potentially $20-50M round
	- Integral: Series B expected before year-end

### Fund II Strategy and Check Sizing

- Current fund size constraints creating competitive challenges
	- $50-55M fund difficult to execute in today’s seed market
	- Leading 75% of deals but constrained by check size limitations
- Target ownership evolution:
	- Moving from 10% to 15% initial ownership
	- Strategy: aggressive upfront capital deployment vs. waiting for Series A
	- Example: Anna Health - 12% at pre-seed, doubled down to 22-23% total ownership
- Check size increase rationale:

### Healthcare Sector Positioning

- Strategic rotation away from care delivery (started 2.5 years ago)
	- Series A/B market sentiment extremely tough for care delivery
	- Oak HC/FT and Transformation Capital reducing care delivery focus
- Portfolio concentration in pharma tech and AI-enabled healthcare
	- Differentiating factor vs. healthcare generalists
	- Anticipating where growth market will move next
- Competitive advantage in technical diligence
	- Founders increasingly seeking brand pedigree (Sequoia, a16z) over healthcare-specific VCs at Series A
	- Healthcare VCs lacking technical skills for AI-native companies

### Guide Investment Case Study

- $500K investment at $75M post (started at $30-35M, bidding war to $75M)
- Exception to typical strategy due to:
	- 5-year relationship with founder Will
	- Learning from two prior high-priced passes (now marked at $1B and $650M)
	- Series A at $250M - considering SPV participation but logistically challenging before Christmas
- Investment philosophy: aggressive early positions in quality companies vs. sourcing for others

**Created:** 2025-12-18T20:00:25.681Z
**Updated:** 2025-12-18T21:50:11.887Z

### Scheduling and Logistics

- Meeting rescheduled to 5pm Central (3 hours from original time)
	- Bobby held up in transit after 2 weeks of travel
	- Tomorrow’s family commitment prevented evening alternative
- Draft memo already sent to Bobby for review ahead of meeting

### Fund Performance and Portfolio Updates

- Q3 2025 marks: 1.7x TVPI, 29% net IRR (34-35% gross)
	- Recent markdowns: Hero Journey written to zero (proactive decision)
	- Q4 expected markdowns across portfolio for conservative approach
- Recent funding rounds completed:
	- Anna Health: $17.5M Series A term sheet (not yet wired)
	- Translucent: Series A at 4-4.5x seed valuation
	- Prudentia: Series A at 3.5-4x seed valuation
	- Hermes: $4M seed at $18M post (from $5M post initial)
- Pipeline developments:
	- Solstice: Most asked-about company, expecting $12-15M Series A
	- Standard Model Bio: Series A in Q1, potentially $20-50M round
	- Integral: Series B expected before year-end

### Fund II Strategy and Check Sizing

- Current fund size constraints creating competitive challenges
	- $50-55M fund difficult to execute in today’s seed market
	- Leading 75% of deals but constrained by check size limitations
- Target ownership evolution:
	- Moving from 10% to 15% initial ownership
	- Strategy: aggressive upfront capital deployment vs. waiting for Series A
	- Example: Anna Health - 12% at pre-seed, doubled down to 22-23% total ownership
- Check size increase rationale:

### Healthcare Sector Positioning

- Strategic rotation away from care delivery (started 2.5 years ago)
	- Series A/B market sentiment extremely tough for care delivery
	- Oak HC/FT and Transformation Capital reducing care delivery focus
- Portfolio concentration in pharma tech and AI-enabled healthcare
	- Differentiating factor vs. healthcare generalists
	- Anticipating where growth market will move next
- Competitive advantage in technical diligence
	- Founders increasingly seeking brand pedigree (Sequoia, a16z) over healthcare-specific VCs at Series A
	- Healthcare VCs lacking technical skills for AI-native companies

### Guide Investment Case Study

- $500K investment at $75M post (started at $30-35M, bidding war to $75M)
- Exception to typical strategy due to:
	- 5-year relationship with founder Will
	- Learning from two prior high-priced passes (now marked at $1B and $650M)
	- Series A at $250M - considering SPV participation but logistically challenging before Christmas
- Investment philosophy: aggressive early positions in quality companies vs. sourcing for others
