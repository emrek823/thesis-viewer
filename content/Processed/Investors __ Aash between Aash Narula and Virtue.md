### Company Background & Team

- Aashray Narula: Law background
	- SSG at Goldman - balance sheet investing in Australia (only grad ever accepted at 21, team typically 26+)
	- Health transformation: lost 130 pounds after pre-diabetic diagnosis, went viral on TikTok
	- Eucalyptus experience: joined early (team of 30, <$10m funding), led men’s health brand to $25m ARR
	- UK expansion: launched Juniper weight loss brand for women, reached $5m ARR in 6 months
- Bryce: Engineering background
	- Cancer diagnosis at 18, pre-med at Brown, switched to computer science
	- Virtue Health: joined at seed, led engineering team for 4 years through unicorn status
	- Fractional CTO at 6+ healthcare startups including YC’s Orchid Health

### Formula Health Business Model

- Core thesis: all digital health/preventative health companies are fundamentally diagnostics businesses needing cross-sell interventions
- Problem: setting up each intervention (supplements, peptides) takes 3-6 months due to ops/partnerships headache
- Solution: API layer that aggregates suppliers, enables intervention launches in days/weeks vs months/years
- Early traction: started selling 2 weeks ago
	- 6 startups and 1 provider signed
	- If execute on contracts: ~$3m ARR in 6 months
	- Flagship customer: Eternal (physical locations + B2B partnerships with Nike/GS)
	- Provider partnership: fertility clinic with 30-40k patients across US

### Technical Infrastructure & Strategy

- Abstraction layer for supplier network
	- Custom integrations with each supplier
	- Longer term: self-onboarding option when sufficient pull
- Deployment: interventions delivered to patients via Stripe checkout or white-labeled components
- End-to-end fulfillment ops layer - “TruePill for different interventions”
- Starting wedge: compounded supplements (Full Script competitor advantage - they can’t do compounding without cannibalizing retail revenue)
- Roadmap: peptides in 18-24 months as more get approved

### Fundraising & Next Steps

- Raising: $3m for 18 months runway
	- Team: Bryce + 3 engineers, ops people, CX offshore, product designer
	- Aash handling sales for next 12 months
- Key milestones before Series A (9-12 months):
	- Two interventions live and executing contracts (3-5m ARR)
	- Sign flagship customer (Function, Whoop, Oura, Hone Health) in Q2/Q3
- Long-term vision: 15% take rate on GMV, then vertical integration for 45-50% margins
- Process: Virtue will send diligence questions, second call is “make or break”
- Timeline: 7-10 days decision process with back-channeling through industry connections
