# BUT TODAY’S RADIOLOGY WORKFLOW IS FRAGMENTED, BROKEN, &#x26; EXPENSIVE

An amalgamation of poorly designed, piecemeal software increases task complexity, reduces productivity, &#x26; negatively impacts patient care.

| Medical Data by Volume | >80%   |

One of the last bastions of the knowledge worker using purely fragmented, on-prem software.
