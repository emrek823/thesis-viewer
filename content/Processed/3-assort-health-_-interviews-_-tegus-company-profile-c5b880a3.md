# Assort Health - Chief Operating Officer at TrustCare Health
## Interview conducted on July 08, 2025

### Topics
Patient Engagement, Vendor Evaluation, Cost Savings, Healthcare Automation, Customer Service, Post-Visit Surveys, Claim Adjudication, AI Phone Reception

### Summary
A healthcare customer service automation expert recommended Flip CX AI for phone reception and Qure4u for patient engagement to the Tegus Client, who ultimately chose Flip over Assort due to a colleague's recommendation and Assort's persistence. The expert highlighted the importance of measuring caller sentiment for AI calls and expressed satisfaction with Flip's integration with their EMR system, rating it an eight out of ten with room for improvement in features like data capture for patient cases. The conversation also focused on downsizing staff, automating insurance claim resolution, and the need for minimal human intervention in non-patient-facing roles, with the Tegus Client inquiring about Flip's integration with existing systems and the technology selection process.

### Expert Details

Q: Please briefly describe your experience with AI tools used for inbound calls and customer service.
A: We evaluated Assort, and several other platforms. We concluded by going with Flip cx AI for AI management of inbound phone calls and outbound patient A/R collection calls.

Q: Do you currently use any AI tools to automate inbound calls and/or customer service? Please list any you use or have evaluated.
A: Assort, Qure4U, Flip cx AI.

### Client
Thank you for meeting with me. I'm interested in learning more about healthcare customer service automation. It'd be good to hear about what technologies you're currently using, then we can go from there.

### Expert
There are a number of traditional methods. There are telephone calls to our clinics and our billing department. There are links on our website to access different divisions, different groups within our organization to make appointments, pay your bill, those types of things. We use a platform called Flip CX AI to answer all of our phones except for our administrative office. We still answer those manually, but every call to a clinic or a billing office or our laboratory are answered by AI first and then, if need be, routed to a human.

We use for patient engagement and patient outreach a platform called Qure4u. We also do post-visit surveys with Qure4u. We use both our EMR, which is Athenahealth, and another vendor called Rivia Health for post-claim adjudication, AR collection via email and text message. Is that kind of what you're looking for?

### Client
That's helpful. Curious on the AI phone call reception side of things. Do you use Flip CX's platform or do you use any other AI players?

### Expert
We just use Flip. We evaluated a handful. Quite frankly, we got very, very close with Assort, but at the end of the day, made a decision to not go with them and go with Flip instead.

### Client
Okay. When were you doing this evaluation?

### Expert
It started in earnest probably in October of last year. We trialed both the Assort and Flip and then made a decision in December and introduced Flip then. I should say we gave both vendors three clinics, and once we made a decision, we gave Flip all the clinics. It was how that worked.

### Client
Okay. Did you look at any others? Do you remember any other players that also seemed like viable competitors?

### Expert
I don't know how familiar you are with Athena as an EMR, but they have something with Athena called our Marketplace. We went to the Athena conference last year in Austin and we talked with and met with every single phone AI vendor in the marketplace. We really only got further down the road with Assort at that point than anybody else. No one else got an evaluation. We had 30-minute or 60-minute meetings but really Assort was the one that grabbed our attention.

### Client
That's interesting. Why did Flip CX win over Assort?

### Expert
Believe it or not, a colleague within Athena came to me and said, "Look, I have some friends there that are part of Flip," which is relatively new at the time, and they're not in healthcare and they're trying to get into healthcare, in particular the urgent care space, which is the majority of our business. He asked me if I would take a look. Part of it was actually just a friend asked me to take a look and do him a favor.

That was one part, the part that actually prevented us from going with Assort was not the product platform whatsoever. It was actually the co-founder, his persistence, for lack of a better term, just really, quite frankly, turned myself and my partner off.

He would call, and one minute later, would email, and 30 seconds later, would text all over the same issue. It was just being smothered quite frankly to make a decision and move forward. The consensus was if that's how our relationship is before we are brought across all clinics with a system, "Is this really the people we want to partner with?" It was more the presentation and the hyper focus in pushing us to make a decision that turned us off as opposed to driving us toward them. Had the presentation, the relationship been different, I think we would have probably signed with them and been just as happy as we are today. It didn't turn out that way.

### Client
Yeah. On the products, they were pretty comparable?

### Expert
Yes. They're comparable in product, they're comparable in pricing. Assort had, and still has, a much broader, larger footprint in healthcare than Flip does. I know this is a crowded space. I know there's tons of people looking into this because everybody does truly see it as part of the future. I think it's likely going to be through your efforts and others. There's got to be some consolidation because there's not room for 25 successful players in this space. There's going to be a couple big winners, and that's how it'll shake out. It certainly is very well be one of them. It's just not from work today. It's not going to be with us.

### Client
Which new players do your peers tend to be talking the most about?

### Expert
I talk to them. The peers I talk to, I talk with them about Flip. I think some of it is age-related as far as the age of the person I'm talking to. Some of it is how technologically forward does someone want to be? Even within my own organization, there are people in leadership roles that adamantly loathe AI, period. They don't want AI answering the phone. When you can explain to them the cost-savings necessity that we just cannot afford or continue to afford the number of people that it requires to answer the incoming calls, there's no other viable solution right now.

### Client
I hear you. How much are you roughly spending? I was going to say, what's the ballpark for how much you're spending per year with Flip CX?

### Expert
We have not been with them yet a year, but I would say we're going to probably be somewhere in the $90,000-$100,000 range.

### Client
Sorry, how many clinics are they going to be rolled out across?

### Expert
They're rolled out across 13. What they've added for us too, it, it ties back to one of the vendors I mentioned earlier that we use a platform called Rivia Health, which is interfaced into Athena, but it sends a patient a text message that, "Hey, this is TrustCare, and you have an outstanding balance of $29. Click this link if you'd like to pay your bill," and you can click it. It keeps you from having to go through the Athena portal and log in with a username and password and all those other things.

We have now gone to Flip. Flip makes outgoing AI calls to patients and asks if you'd like to pay your bill. If we're calling you on your cell phone, press one, and we send that patient a link at that point in time where they can press the link and pay their bill as well. They've added that on for us at no charge just why we both tested and had add things to their product platform.

### Client
Okay. I was just curious, did you ever hear of a player called Hello Patient?

### Expert
Yes. We talked with them and Athena also, yes.

### Client
Okay. How close were they to being in the running? Do you remember that conversation?

### Expert
I remember the conversation. I remember what their booth looked like and the gentleman we talked with, but there wasn't anything that was so demonstrably beneficial one over the other. I think, quite frankly, we were a little further down the road in talking with Assort before we got there and then we met a lot of others while we were there. I don't think that platform may just have been a factor of bad timing on our part or their part.

### Client
Yup. Hypothetically, could they have shown you any features at that time that would have made you go, "Wow, we need to make this the front-runner over Assort or Flip CX?"

### Expert
There is absolutely one feature that whoever develops this to the point of full functionality, I think, will succeed, and that is being able to measure the number of calls that are being answered, or better yet, managed by AI. End-to-end management of a call without ever being transferred to a human is obviously the goal. You can't measure sentiment from that. If 100 out of 150 calls don't go to a human being, of the 100 that are managed end to end with AI, how many of those callers are angry, how many are frustrated, how many hang up because they know they're talking to AI?

If Hello Patient or Assort or even Flip, we had a call with them earlier this morning on this very feature that has to be completed. We're using another vendor right now over top of Flip to measure caller sentiment. I think that that's a huge piece. You can't just tell me you managed 100 calls because if you pissed off 90 of those people, you didn't really help us. Caller sentiment, are they satisfied, dissatisfied, neutral as to their engagement with an AI platform, I think, is going to be huge to whoever can streamline that and make it more functional than it is today.

### Client
That's really helpful. Did any of my colleagues have any questions? I know this is hard to do and it's been a few months since you completed the evaluation, but if you are going to give Flip a product score on a scale of 1-10, one being hate and 10 being love, what product score would you give it and why?

### Expert
I would probably give it an eight. We've developed a pretty close relationship with them, and they've done lots of things we've asked them to do, but there's still a ways to go. Caller sentiment being one. They were eager to work with us to interface into Athena. I don't want to bore you with our EMR, but if you're familiar with Athena at all, all the communication within Athena between our staff is done with something called a patient case. Flip interfaced with Athena and is able to take a call, transcribe that into a text, and actually send that to the correct person within our organization as a patient case.

If a patient calls, primary care and has a question about anything to do with a prescription, a refill, a question about their prescription, its impact, its side effects, whatever it is, Flip can take that and turn that into a patient case that goes to a nurse bucket, that then is addressed, and we address that via text with another platform back to the patient.

It takes the 30 calls a day that are about prescriptions and turn those into 30 patient cases that can be managed via text in minutes. Not playing phone tape back and forth with somebody that doesn't answer the phone because they don't recognize member calling them. As we continue to expand those features, I think my rating for them would go up, quite frankly. What we expected them to do for us on the front-end, they have delivered.

### Client
Just to make sure I understand, it's like data capture from the patient to create patient cases. That's something that they offer and you want them to get better at?

### Expert
In short, yes. They can identify if you're an existing patient, Flip can, by recognition, when they're interfaced with Athena, recognizes your phone number. If Person A is calling, Flip knows that Person A is calling and who she is. It can take that, her patient ID, her phone number, and the message, convert all of that into one patient case in text that goes to a nurse bucket to be managed, as an example.

### Client
It sounds like you're using Flip for more than just scheduling. You're using them for full intake.

### Expert
We're trying to utilize them for telephone management, simply call volume management. I will tell you, last year we saw 170,000 patients, and we had well over 200,000 incoming phone calls. We can't continue to pay somebody $55,000 a year to answer the phone. We have to find a solution to be able to reduce headcount.

The other piece I don't want to miss either is my recollection of talking with many of these companies were all based on all of their white papers and their marketing was based around reducing the size of your call center. We never had a call center. We had 13 individual call centers because each clinic had their own unique number. The only way that there could be value delivered to us with an AI phone system is if we could actually send somebody home. There's actually an FTE savings, and we were able to do that.

### Client
What are the FTE savings that you're seeing with Flip?

### Expert
We downsized 22 people at an average cost to a company of no more than $50,000 a year.

### Client
Is that 50% of the team?

### Expert
That was probably 40% of our team. We have some clinics that still are staffed with two people at the front. The three busiest clinics are still staffed with two at the front. The other 10, because we're open seven days a week, so there's two shifts, so each of the other 11 had two people at the front each day. Now, only have one person at the front each day. It was 21-22 people that were reassigned or termed at an average expense of no more than $50,000 a year.

Our estimate, if we save $1 million and spend $100,000, we come up, the net positive to us is pretty good. Now, if the net positive to us is 100,000 angry patients, then we didn't really help ourselves. That's why the whole sentiment, listening to calls, listening to recordings, understanding is that somebody that's hanging up angrily because they're not getting to the person they need to be, then saving money isn't helping us at that point if we're losing the patient as a result.

### Client
I just really want to go back to the use cases where you're using Flip because there's such a wide range of possibilities. It sounds like you're using them for patient data collection, scheduling an appointment. Any other use cases?

### Expert
On average, we get a weekly report. We have a dashboard we can go to any day. On average, 70%, seven out of 10 calls that come into a clinic are appointment-related. Virtually all of those have the ability to be managed without human intervention. You want to change your appointment, you want to schedule an appointment, you want to ask if you can make an appointment. All of those can be done because we can send you, if you're calling from the cell phone, we can send you a link that does what you've asked us to do.

I'm Person B. I have an appointment on July 10th. I need to change my appointment from 2:30 P.M. to sometime later in the day. I would get a very specific link sent back to me that gives me the options for the other appointment times on that day.

For example, the remainder of the calls are all of the other things you mentioned, prescription-related. It's not like there's a sloping bell curve. If you put it in a bar chart, one bar is three" tall and everything else is three mm tall, as far as the percent of the total calls. The goal is to utilize Flip or any other AI phone solution that we evaluate. The goal would be to use them to eliminate as many calls that require human intervention as possible.

### Client
Makes sense. We see the market pull in this category. We see the very clear ROI. We also see the 20 vendors, as you said. A lot of people have recognized the opportunity here. You made the recommendation that phone call sentiment is critical for winning this market. Is there anything else that you think would be a game-changer for a vendor in this space? Possibly more outbound call workflows for bill pay or maybe it is outbound calling for insurance claims. Anything else at all? We were like, "Heck, if someone also offered this, that would really stand above the crowd."

### Expert
Yeah. Flip has already been set up with us for the outbound calls for bill collection. I think if it could be automated through our revenue cycle process that if there was, upon intake, we transposed a number from your insurance card or something like that, or we didn't have an image of your insurance card on file, the state we're based in, the largest payer in the state, 80% of the lives are insured with Blue Cross Blue Shield. Blue Cross Blue Shield in a state does not issue a hard or paper insurance card. It's an app on your phone. It makes the collection of your insurance card that much more challenging for us.

If we transpose or you as a patient transpose your membership number or your plan number, if AI, in general, whether it be phone or anything else, could help us correct those issues without it being a high-priced revenue cycle person making an outbound phone call, that would be advantageous, yes. The volume there, it's not thousands of calls a month, it's a handful. Anything that would allow us to have one less employee.

I don't mean to dehumanize what we do at all, because what we are supposed to do is take great care of patients, but everybody that doesn't touch a patient, we need as few of those people as possible. It's just if we can replace overhead expense with automation, that's the direction we're going.

### Client
Are you using Flip to reach out to insurers if they do a claim rejection?

### Expert
We're not yet. We're working with them. Not yet because there's two parts to it. Reaching out is one thing, but then what do they do with that information? We're working with another vendor that we outsource some of our revenue cycle to and they have AI that they're developing claiming they're going to get to that point. They're not there yet, but they're claiming that.

What everybody ideally wants, in my opinion, in health care is claim resolution that's automated. There's not paper back and forth. There's not emails back and forth. There are no phone calls back and forth. It's two systems talking to each other to figure out what's the problem and how do we fix it.

One of the things we measure and report every single week we meet and report on something called the first-pass clean claims rate. What percentage of claims that went out passed and were paid the first time without anybody having to do anything else? That number is critically important because every percentage point that drops below our target is extra work somebody has to do. If Flip or Assort or Hello Patient or Uncle Bob's AI Company can help us do that, we would look at it and talk to them.

### Client
Okay. Just through your network, it didn't sound like you knew anyone that had moved forward with Hello Patient or Assort Health?

### Expert
No. Again, we're predominantly in urgent care, and being in urgent care when COVID hit accelerated our advance to get away from paper. If you've ever been to a doctor where they need a clipboard and a pen and you write your name and address on seven different pieces of paper, we got out of that in 2019, and went to an automated registration with the forethought pre-COVID being, for example, our cell phone collection rate was 13%.

Now, our cell phone collection rate is 100% because that's the only way you can register as a patient, which opens up an enormous number of opportunities for us on the marketing front, for example, or Rivia Health, as I've mentioned before on getting bills paid, getting AR collected. Just the simple capture of your cell phone two years before COVID and now six years ago was the first step of game-changing for us.

I saw my dermatologist the other day, and she still writes on a piece of paper and sticks them in the middle of the folder. There are still people in 1978 out there. I also think, depending upon the size of the organization, the adoption of AI phones, I'm glad I'm not in that business because to me right now it seems hyper competitive. How you get a big health system like the Mayo Clinic or Cleveland Clinic or Kaiser Permanente to make a decision on a market that's about six minutes old, it's going to be a while.

### Client
Yeah. I'm not sure if my colleagues have any other questions. I was just curious, whenever you evaluate a technology like this, do you always get it down to two players and test them at a couple locations and then select one to roll out more broadly?

### Expert
Yes. If we can, that's what we do. Not that it matters, but my background, I have a degree in industrial engineering, which really applies to, of all things, it applies to RFPs and RFIs and evaluating platforms and scoring things with as little emotion as possible and as much science as possible. We built that into when we made big platform changes. It's never done by emotion or who bought us the nicest dinner or who has the best background on the team's call.

Early on at TrustCare, the guy that's not my partner tended to fall in love with the last person we talked with. You know what I mean? I used to joke with surgeons. Surgeons remember two things, the best thing and the last thing that happened to them.

That's how this place operated. I changed that to make it unemotional. We bring people in from other departments. They're not that are tangentially impacted, marketing, finance, operations to let them also be a part of it. The one thing I haven't mentioned too, that did separate some of the companies we talked with was actually the voice tone and inflection and the quality of the voice on the AI voice itself. I think when some people still consider they're talking to artificial intelligence, they're thinking of the 1980s robocall, not the technology to the level that it is today.

### Client
Yeah. Maybe lastly, what are the key systems that Flip needs to integrate with, and what are you using for your telephony?

### Expert
We work with a VoIP system that it's just quite frankly an off-the-shelf system that we have a local company called ITC Telecom. It's obviously interfaced to them. That takes 10 seconds to put the voice AI onto a VoIP number that's pretty painless and seamless and happens in minutes. They work with them and then they are interfaced with Athena for many of the reasons that we discussed. They're interfaced with the Qure4u platform that we use for registration, which actually helps pull patient AR when they make that phone call, and they send a link to the patient from yet another vendor, Rivia Health. They're not interfaced with Rivia, they just have a link they use.

### Client
Got you.

### Expert
It's our patient engagement platform, the EMR, and then just our phone system itself is who they interface with.

### Client
Thank you for your time and insights. Have a great day.
