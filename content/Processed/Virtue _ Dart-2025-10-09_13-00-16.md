### Company Updates and Performance

- General review: last 3 weeks a bit slower due to family bereavement - close family member passed away, required ~2 weeks away
- Just returned from recent Becker’s conference that ended a few days ago

### Current ARR and Pipeline

- Current ARR: $1.5M (same as 3 weeks ago with Emre)
- Two large deals trying to close this month:
	- Both ~$350-$400K annual contracts
	- Enterprise hospices from summer pipeline
	- Both moving slowly for reasons on client side
- Year-end revenue projection: $2.5M-$3M contracted ARR
	- Stopped hospice sales to focus on new co-pilot approach

### Co-pilot Strategy as Market Entry Wedge

- Major strategic pivot: using oncology co-pilot as entry point into health system workflows
- Since Monday: interviewing oncologists daily to gather data points
- John Muir Health progress:
	- Steadily moving in right direction
	- Large C-suite meeting scheduled in SF in ~2 weeks
	- Will pitch co-pilot use case they suggested around oncology dosing and treatment protocols
- Key differentiation from core proactive AI workflows:
	- Oncologist-driven chat format rather than automated analysis
	- Complex specialty-specific implementation, not generic wrapper

### Oncology Co-pilot Market Opportunity

- Current oncologist tools:
	- Physical books printed and maintained across cancer centers
	- Manual research via NCCN, PubMed, journals
- Tech-savvy oncologists using ChatGPT/OpenEvidence face two key frustrations:
	- No native secure patient context integration
	- Missing oncology-specific knowledge base (NCCN guidelines, local policies, clinical trials)
- John Muir Health co-development goals:
	- Co-develop larger product with their oncologists
	- Productize quickly for broader market
	- They maintain local treatment protocols that other cancer centers license
- Pricing model: $500-$1K per user per month
	- Target users: medical oncologists (80% of team), plus nurses and pharmacists
	- JMH example: 25-30 oncologists = ~$200K for single specialty
	- Conservative ROI: 5-7x savings on $200/hour oncologist time, saving 7-8 hours weekly

### Go-to-Market Focus and Health System Pipeline

- Strategic shift toward Academic Medical Centers (AMCs) for highest leverage
- Also exploring large provider groups:
	- Tennessee Oncology: 100+ oncologists (3x JMH contract size)
- Active pipeline beyond JMH:
	- MD Anderson Cancer Center: ongoing conversations
	- Tennessee Oncology: spreading through organization rapidly, talking to medical directors and CMO
- Slower progress with previous targets:
	- Atrium and Advent: product requires intensive installation/co-development
- Cleveland Clinic feedback challenge: preference for “prestigious” vendors (OpenAI, Palantir) despite cost
- Specialty-focused approach generating different conversation dynamics:
	- Less focus on company logos/credentials
	- Department-level buying power
	- Easier path to CFO approval

### Hiring Pipeline Updates

- AI/ML Engineer search:
	- Lost top candidate (CMU grad, JP Morgan AML experience) to competitor
	- Competitor offered $350K salary + 4-5% equity
	- Two remaining strong candidates:
		- Kaya: currently doing AI at Stripe
		- Columbia research background: relevant AI work at Appian (government contractor)
- Deployment Strategist:
	- Final rounds with USC computational neuroscience grad/medical doctor
	- 1.5-2 years tech experience including Amboss (European health tech)
	- Ready to accept offer if extended
- Sales hiring paused until co-pilot validation complete
- Target: extend offers by end of October

### Year-End Goals and 2026 Planning

- End of year objectives:
	- Full department using co-pilot at minimum one health system
	- Prefer provider group addition for better iteration feedback
	- JMH-size deployment live by mid-to-late November
- 2026 strategy: use reference customers to scale nationally across health systems
- Proposed in-person meeting in NYC (week of Oct 28-30) to plan:
	- 12-month roadmap to exceed $10M ARR by end of 2026
	- Product strategy and roadmap requirements
	- Hiring plan and commercial BD strategy
