# Trial Sponsors Lose Hundreds of Millions of Dollars

## Supply Chain Complexity

| **Component**          | **Issues**                                                                                     |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Trial Vendors**      | Drug, device, kit, and supply distribution is reactive.                                       |
| **Research Sites**     | No systems exist to help sites manage inventory &#x26; orders.                                     |
| **Study Patients**     | There’s no easy way to forecast patient inventory requirements.                                |
| **Analytical Labs**    | Ensuring samples end up at the right labs requires lots of PM.                               |

### Key Statistics
- 94% of clinical trials are delayed more than a month.
- Delays cost $600K to $8M per day.
