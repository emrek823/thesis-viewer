### Business Strategy Evolution

- Focus now on 4 specialties: Oncology, GI, cardiology, ortho
- Top 3 learnings since last chat:
	- Point solution vs platform approach shift
		- Previously anti-point solutions, believed hospitals wouldn’t adopt 10 different tools
		- Platform pitch proved too overwhelming for clinicians
		- Clinicians think granularly about individual problems, not meta-level workflow connections
		- Staff too busy to conceptualize integrated solutions
	- New sales approach: present features as individual solutions that happen to connect
		- Don’t lead with “platform” messaging
		- Show modular capabilities that reveal platform nature over time
		- Has been resonating much better with prospects
- Platform architecture remains: most generalizable platform that scales well but customizable per clinic
	- Data unification layer key differentiator
	- Standardizes all referral sources (fax, EMR, email) into central starting point
	- Enables downstream efficiency across all workflows

### Market Approach & Connections

- MSO strategy discussion:
	- Mandolin’s top-down approach vs Solstice’s bottom-up
	- Sathvik positioned closer to Mandolin model due to platform touching multiple roles
	- Hybrid approach recommended: start with 1-2 point solutions sold top-down
	- Oncology MSOs more sophisticated due to Flatiron $2B exit influence
	- Cardiology mostly hospital-based or already rolled up
	- Ortho specialists focused on procedural revenue generation
- Potential connections discussed:
	- Chamber Cardio (provider enablement in cardiology)
	- Imam Katsupata’s father (independent cardiologist in PA/Jersey area)
	- Welsh Carson PE report on physician practice management opportunities by specialty

### Funding Timeline

- Current status: completed pre-seed with Lior
- Seed timing: 2-2.5 months out
	- Waiting for current pilots to convert to contracts
	- Wants clear customer pipeline and product vision before raising
	- Views each funding round as additional responsibility requiring solid execution plan
