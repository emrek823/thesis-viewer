Will need to continue to evolve to reduce/prevent physician burnout and continue to serve medicine with accurate/evidence based clinical document creation and meets criteria for EHR integration and insurance billing. Will need to maintain cost efficacy while capturing patient complexity to maximize insurance reimbursement.

**Client**
Thank you for your time. To kick things of, we're spending time looking at the healthcare AI space broadly. Specifically, we understand that you're a customer of Abridge, so really want to focus on that today and how you're using the product, your evaluation process, etc. We'll come with some more detailed questions. Maybe just to start, it'd be helpful to get a brief one-minute overview of your current role, and then we can get more into our specific questions.

**Expert**
Sure. I'm a cardiologist. I work in an academic medical center. We're a regional hospital system, but I'm part of the leadership through one of the hospitals under the umbrella of the regional hospital system. We've been trying to incorporate more and more AI-based solutions over the last six to 12 months and then notably, our hospital. I know it's happening via some other parallel paths, via some of the other hospitals as well, but I can speak about our experience within the department of cardiology.

**Client**
That is really helpful. Maybe just even taking a step back, it'd be helpful to understand what are your key priorities on the AI front. Are there any specific real drivers that are creating a need for AI and what are maybe the main use cases where you guys are trying to see it roll out?

**Expert**
Good question. It seems to be permeating a lot of spaces in our world. I think it's funny enough, it's sometimes creating a need that we didn't know that we had, so to speak. We use it a lot for medical document, medical note generation. I think this is all under the global hope of improving efficiency, improving communication, diagnostics. These are medical legal documents. We want to make sure that we're as thorough and as detailed as we need to be.

I'm a physician, I practice a lot of clinical medicine and this is something that is a lot of what we do on a day-to-day basis. We take care of patients, but really sometimes the bane of our existence is documentation. I think a lot of our hopes with some of these solutions is improve the physician experience, improve the patient experience.

The less time I have to spend in front of a computer documenting, the more time I can spend with people. I appreciate that. They appreciate that. To some of us it does improve our efficiency, our collectible billing. I think for a lot of us it's a lot to document thoroughly when you're seeing 20 patients a day.

**Client**
That makes sense. I'm guessing the answer is no, but have you spent much time looking at any admin solutions on billing side and referrals and patient intake, or have you more been focused on the clinical doctor tool?

**Expert**
No. I've been involved in some of the solutions for enhancing our billing, better capturing patient complexity. I think we certainly have some numbers within our system. More or less, I think we leave a lot of money on the table. I think we under capture some of the critical illness and complexity of our patients. I think that's reflected in some of the less than ideal billing that we've had. I think that certainly we've looked at some AI solutions to not only help us enhance our billing and collections, but better, like I said, capture the complexity of some of the patients that we take care of.

**Client**
Got it. Maybe if we could start specifically with Abridge, it'd be helpful to know, did you have any scribe tool in place prior to Abridge or what was the existing solution before you adopted them?

**Expert**
A lot of us had in-person scribes that we would pay. A lot of these were college students and pre-medical students. A lot of us use Dragon and Nuance. That was probably the most common solution, I would say, we had before starting Abridge.

**Client**
That's helpful. What led you to seek out a new solution, particularly for the people that were using Nuance? Were there any shortcomings with that platform?

**Expert**
No. I know that Nuance has evolved from Dragon. I think Dragon was a lot of what we used where it was voice recognition. We would still leave a patient encounter and have to walk to our computer and dictate a clinical encounter, make a note. That's fine. Doctors are in varying levels of efficiency and thoroughness and being able to complete that at varying levels. I think many of us saw that what we were doing on a day-to-day basis, we go in, we talk to the patient, we formulate a plan.

There's a lot of redundancy in terms of I go through all of this. Some of my colleagues like to document while they're talking to patients. That can have varying levels of patient satisfaction when they don't feel like they have their physician's undivided attention. Other doctors like to give that attention, but they're giving up. Once they leave the room, they have to document before seeing the next patient.

Some physicians leave all of this documentation to the end of the day. Once they've seen all their patients, they're writing clinical notes for another two or three hours. There are lots of different styles and ways and methods that all of my colleagues do this. I think at the end of the day we saw this as what we were doing is redundant. We are trying to improve the efficiency and the experience not only of the patient but of physicians.

I think the hope with some of these solutions is this. Documentation being in front of a computer is one of but many reasons that leads to physician burnout. Our hope was to try to offer this not only to improve that physician experience, but retain physicians, be able to attract physicians knowing that this is one solution that we're being offered.

**Client**
That makes sense. What EHR are you using today?

**Expert**
We use Epic.

**Client**
Got it. Is the way that you're actually consuming Abridge, is it powering their Haiku platform for you or are you using Abridge outside of Epic? Just curious how you're actually consuming it.

**Expert**
It's running through Epic.

**Client**
Got it. Maybe just to start with Abridge as well, curious, since you've been using it now, what have been the best maybe features or the positive sides of the platform? Are there any shortcomings or areas where you think they can improve on the flip side?

**Expert**
I think it's something that's very personalizable. You can change it and adjust it not only for how it's laying a note out and what sort of detail. You can personalize it, I'll say. I like that. Personally, I have been through a number of iterations in terms of how I want it to read and interpret my encounters and what I want my clinical notes and documentation to look like. I think it adds a lot of thoughtful details.

I think it's fairly good, inevitably with patient conversations. There's a lot of superfluous information that I think it's pretty good about picking and choosing what's appropriate and necessary and pertinent for the medical record and what's not. I think those are all great things. Like I said, it wasn't perfect from the get-go, but I think it's allowed. With a little bit of input and guidance to, it allows you to make those adjustments so that it's doing what you want it to do.

**Client**
That makes sense. Maybe just on the flip side, have you experienced any areas for improvement or shortcomings with their platform?

**Expert**
Not necessarily. With anything, there's a learning curve there, some growing pains. I think that our rollout period, integration into Epic, some of these modifications, that's all. I would call them growing pains. I wouldn't say they're necessarily pain points. I think we've smoothed them over. It wasn't based on some of those changes, some of the decreases in efficiency that we saw over a few weeks or months while each clinician got it to where they wanted it to go. That was a process. I wouldn't necessarily put that as a negative, but it wasn't fully streamlined and smooth either.

**Client**
That's helpful. Are you using Abridge for both inpatient and outpatient care or just one or the other?

**Expert**
Good question. We're using it predominantly for outpatient care.

**Client**
Got it. Have you tried it for inpatient at all?

**Expert**
I think a few of us have. Some of it we run into a little bit of the logistic challenge of we don't have it perfectly set up in every inpatient room. A lot of our outpatient clinics are more wired and set up for it, and we do have some modules that we can bring in and have it done. It's not used a lot. I'd say most of my experience has been 95% in the outpatient setting. I think the ultimate goal is to be able to do that. We just aren't there yet.

**Client**
Okay. You don't think it's necessarily a product issue. It's more just you haven't set up your infrastructure for inpatient usage.

**Expert**
Exactly.

**Client**
Great. I have some questions around competition. Maybe just moving on to the evaluation process, it'd be helpful to understand if you did look at any other competitors when you're evaluating solutions in this space.

**Expert**
Like I said, we did look at Nuance. We did look at Ambience. I think we looked at DeepScribe. Those were probably three of them, what we looked at. I think at the end of the day, we used each one of them for a short period of time. I think some of it blew up to price point.

I think they all offered a very similar product with lots of tailorability, I would say. I think for us, again, the price point mattered. I think with most, it does. I think that was meeting a minimal level of competency and need for what our clinicians were looking for. I think most of them did that. I think Abridge came in competitive from a cost standpoint.

**Client**
Interesting. We've heard Ambience come up quite a bit on these calls. I do not know if there is anything you noticed about their product that was maybe a little bit different or were they stronger in certain areas than others relative to Abridge or would you say they are relatively on par from a product perspective?

**Expert**
I think some of the things I may have noticed, some of these products are made to be able to take a deep dive into the medical record. We're looking at patients that sometimes have years and decades of medical history that as a physician we're able to comb through that and look, but we don't have hours and hours to look through that.

One thing I'll say about Ambience, I think it was perhaps a little bit better at looking deeper into the patient's medical history. Despite sitting in front of a patient and talking to them about their medical history, they can't always give you the most pertinent things that us as physicians are looking for. I think Ambience was maybe sometimes particularly strong at capturing some of that that may be relevant history that wasn't always easily discoverable, if that makes sense.

**Client**
That makes sense. They're just doing that by going through the EHR and surfacing relevant insights? How does that actually manifest itself?

**Expert**
It manifested by bringing up medical history. It can locate it, it can give us an idea of, "Oh, this patient had a procedure on their carotid artery 15 years ago," that maybe the patient either didn't know or didn't remember. That happens actually quite often. I think they will just pull up some. I think as a cardiologist from sometimes risk assessment and being able to really capture some things that may make a patient higher of, let's say, an operable risk, it probably did pretty good at that.

**Client**
Got it. I'm just looking at their website right now. It looks like they do some nice pre-visit summaries and things like that. Does Abridge not offer that as well, or they just don't do as good of a job at really going through all the deep details?

**Expert**
It does. What I just told you is maybe a somewhat superficial anecdotal experience. I don't know that I have a lot of stock to support that. That was on my brief use of Ambience versus Abridge. That is something I noticed.

**Client**
That's helpful. It sounds like it, but we heard conflicting things. Would you say Ambience is directly competitive with Abridge, or is there ever a situation where you might use both of them side by side? It looks like their products are pretty much the same, but just want to get your take on that.

**Expert**
I can't think of an example where somebody would want to use them in parallel. At least not in the space that we use it.

**Client**
That makes sense. On the Epic side, I know one thing with Abridge is they really touts their deep relationship and integration with Epic. Curious if you think Abridge's relationship and level of depth of that integration is any different than some of the other players you evaluated, at least based on what you've seen, or would you say that it's pretty much the same across the board for all of these?

**Expert**
Probably pretty close. I don't know if I can think of any examples. I think it's probably splitting hairs. I would say it's probably pretty, pretty similar.

**Client**
It sounds like all these players you basically can directly use them within Epic or at least the ones that you evaluated, and there doesn't seem to be any difficulties there.

**Expert**
Exactly. I would say that they're probably pretty similar.

**Client**
That's helpful. One more thing, maybe on DeepScribe, can you briefly touch on that one as well? I don't know if there is anything specific about the product that you would call out.

**Expert**
I think we trialed it for a few weeks. Nothing jumps out as particularly different. Some of the way we're trying to look at this is with really efficient doctors, we're talking about a doctor saving maybe two or three minutes a patient. If you look at that two or three minutes over 20 patients a day, that's over an hour of time.

I think that the savings in time claimed by some of these versus what we really saw, again, I would say that we're really talking the difference of a minute or so. Within that assessment, there's really a broad variability in terms of user competency, detail expected, things like that. I thought it was accurate. I thought really it was probably on par with Abridge and Ambience.

**Client**
That's helpful. Curious how you found Abridge's coding ability?

**Expert**
Medical coding, I thought it was very good. I think that as doctors, if you know anything about medical coding and ICD-10 codes, they get very, very specific. That's probably one of the things that is very fatigue-inducing for us. Where it's not only do I have to tell if the patient is diabetic, I have to say if they're insulin dependent and if they have renal dysfunction. There's a lot of what we call qualifiers that it just turns into click burnout.

When I'm clicking on a patient with a diagnosis, I have to maybe make five more clicks to further capture and characterize the complexity of that patient's diabetes, for example. I think these are very good. Again, ICD-10 codes are made to be very specific. I think that some of these solutions are very good at naturally capturing that because it knows the patient has chronic kidney disease and is on insulin and has diabetic retinopathy, for example.

I think that it captures it for us where a lot of times as doctors, probably due to just fatigue, we would sometimes click the button that means it says otherwise unspecified. Meaning, I don't have that information. I think bottom line, it is doing some of that heavy lifting for us as well, which to the point of capturing patient complexity and enhancing our billing, is very useful.

**Client**
That's really interesting. Do you think if Abridge were to get more deeply into revenue cycle management and billing, dealing with claims and all that, is that something that you would be inclined to use from theirs, or would you prefer to have a separate RCM solution?

**Expert**
It's a good question. That's such a complex question in terms of, I think we would, of course, like to keep things as simple and as single solution as possible. Right now, we are using some different revenue and coding solutions. To have one, if it was able to do everything we need, be able to come through with the cost savings to offset the cost of the software, etc. I think that myself and our leadership is not opposed to that idea.

**Client**
Do you know what you're currently using for RCM?

**Expert**
We're using Smarter Technologies.

**Client**
Got it. Would there be any concerns around if you were to maybe adopt more of an end-to-end vendor that you could get taken advantage of or squeezed on pricing or whatnot? Do you have any concerns around having that stickiness into one end-to-end vendor? Would you almost rather have smaller point solutions? I don't know what your views are on that, but I know lots of different views on this thing.

**Expert**
It's a good question. I think that is certainly a concern that has been voiced and that sometimes it is nice to have a little bit of separation of power, so to speak. That is something that we're always assessing. We're aware of that being a risk. I think until the time came where we had to consider one single solution versus multiple different ones, it's hard to say.

**Client**
That makes sense. Taking a step back as well, obviously, there are so many players in this space, but how sticky is Abridge's product? Would it be really easy to just swap them out since it's all just integrating to Epic? Would it be easy to swap them out and use Ambience if you wanted to, or would that be a longer process?

**Expert**
That's a good question. I think part of our assessment and concern was inevitably especially in healthcare setting with a new solution rollout, whether it's an Epic update or we're getting new echocardiography software or something, that instills a lot of fear in physicians because we worry about our productivity, our efficiency, our day-to-day operations coming to a grinding halt.

I'll say, there were certainly growing pains and there was a learning curve with this. I would like to think that should the day come that we switch to another one, hopefully, what we've learned so far would lessen that transition. I think some of that boils down to IT integration and transition and the IT solution aspect of it. That's beyond me. Our experience as the end user is different than how it's plugged in and how it changes the interface with which we're working.

I would like to think that it'd be easier, but I really don't know with each of these, what that would look like. I think most of us don't want to be switching solutions frequently. We don't want to have to go to another one in 12 or 18 months. Sometimes that happens. We would like to be happy with and stick with what we have if it's working.

**Client**
That's fair. Do you know how long it took to actually get Abridge up and running and integrated to all your systems?

**Expert**
It was to varying degrees. It was a couple weeks.

**Client**
Helpful. I'm just trying to get a sense of how big of a company Abridge can be. It seems highly capable. Maybe in the past the area it's serving has been considered more of a tool. It seems like they could move into things like RCM, but perhaps it's not like a natural cross-sell. Appreciating your view, would you be surprised maybe if in five years this company was a large public company?

**Expert**
Not at all. It's interesting because in the healthcare space, you look at Epic. Epic is still private. I think these companies will continue to grow. I wouldn't be surprised if these companies were to go public in the next three to five years. I think right now they're jockeying for market share and trying to see how many customers they can get. I wouldn't be surprised.

**Client**
Got it. Are there any other features that you think Abridge should add to their platform as they look to build it out more? What do you think are maybe immediate things that they should add directly and then longer-term expansions? What areas do you think they could naturally expand into?

**Expert**
Are you saying outside of healthcare?

**Client**
No, within healthcare. Are there any more administrative workflows? We talked a bit about RCM, but what about things like patient intake and referrals and things like that? Curious how you're thinking about other options, if that makes sense.

**Expert**
I think intake referrals, patient scheduling, those are three areas that have a lot of administrative burden and delays. Medicine is a limited resource. Right now a lot of things we do in cardiology, they're wait lists of people. We're talking about bottlenecks of operating room time, nursing shortages. I don't know how these solutions could help that.

I think that they could better help arrange and rearrange and adjust our staff strategy to maximize what our staff is able to accommodate and improve some of these wait lists. Some of these patients are waiting for high-risk procedures that until they have it done, they remain at risk. I'm really thinking outside the box here, but I think that that is certainly a big pain point that we have. I don't necessarily have the answer for how this might improve that. There's certainly something further explored.

**Client**
That's helpful. Are there any other questions that we haven't asked or things that you think are important to mention as it relates to Abridge or the market more broadly?

**Expert**
No, I don't think so. I think there's nothing we haven't touched on. As doctors, somebody comes in with an issue and we generate a differential diagnosis. As doctors we try to think about unusual things, things that are really potentially dangerous to the patient. We forget things. We have knowledge gaps. I think that this has been also a good solution about filling in some of those weaknesses, whether it's a knowledge gap, whether I forgot.

Whether I just forgot to put it in my note. I think it does fill in some of the gaps, not only from a patient care standpoint, but from a liability medical, legal standpoint. I think that the savings that we see there is obviously going to be hard to calculate. We obviously don't want to miss things, and we don't want untoward events to happen to patients. I think this has contributed to helping prevent that too.

**Client**
That makes sense. Awesome. That is all the questions I have. This has been really helpful. Thank you.
