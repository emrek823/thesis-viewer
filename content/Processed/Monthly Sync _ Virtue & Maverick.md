### Market Activity & Deal Quality

- Leading slightly more toward seed since 2024
	- Heavy deal flow volume - “so many things raising all at the same time”
	- Quality signal hard to identify within volume
	- Sent ~15 pass emails in past week from companies that will still get funded
- Overall quality bar has improved significantly
	- Top-end market improving year over year
	- Investments from last 12 months wouldn’t have made cut in first 1-2 years of fund one
	- Recent portfolio companies (Dart Health, Standard Model Bio) represent higher caliber than historical investments

### Notable Deal Flow & Company Updates

- Seed / Series A activity trending more toward seed ingredients
- Recent passes with market interest:
	- Talus: Supply chain/Clarium competitor with clinical engagement wedge
	- Sonata: Sean + David team, $8M pre-seed with limited product detail
		- Strong founder credentials (MBA, Linear background)
		- Lack of specificity around biomarkers and value proposition
	- Mentala: AI-guided therapy pivot, signed $10M term sheet in 4-5 days
		- Poor pitch quality with regulatory/liability concerns
		- Operating potentially illegally by marketing as “AI guided therapy”
- Portfolio companies likely raising in 60-100 days:
	- Integral
	- Solstice
	- Standard Model Bio

### AI Healthcare & Clinical Applications

- Dart Health: “Palantir for health systems” AI deployment platform
	- Started post-acute/home health, expanding to health systems
	- Platform approach vs point solutions (malnutrition prediction, readmission risk, etc.)
	- Revenue doubled in past 2 months since investment
- Interest in AI clinician/patient care applications
	- Limited quality options currently in market
	- Seeing many Torch-adjacent pitches (record aggregation)
	- Knit Health: Berkeley team building models based on provider experience vs PubMed literature
- Open evidence category discussions ongoing
	- Various niche approaches (oncology, inpatient-focused)
	- No strong thesis or compelling founder identified yet

### Next Steps

- Kevin (Standard Model Bio) intro for health conference in Vegas
- Knit Health research paper to be shared
- Continue tracking AI healthcare opportunities
