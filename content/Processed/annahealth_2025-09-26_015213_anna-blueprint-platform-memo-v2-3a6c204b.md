# ANNA Origins

ANNA opened our doors in February 2024 for our first location in Sudbury, Massachusetts. The results were the following:

## ANNA Annual Recurring Revenue, March 2024 - December 2024

| Month | Annual Recurring Revenue |
| :---------------- | :----------------------- |
| Mar 2024 | $160,000 |
| Apr 2024 | $320,000 |
| May 2024 | $560,000 |
| Jun 2024 | $720,000 |
| Jul 2024 | $880,000 |
| Aug 2024 | $880,000 |
| Sep 2024 | $1,040,000 |
| Oct 2024 | $1,120,000 |
| Nov 2024 | $1,200,000 |
| Dec 2024 | $1,600,000 |

We started ANNA with the hypothesis that the gold-standard of evidence-based care, Naturalistic Developmental Behavioral Interventions (NDBI), was a clinical model that was both superior for autistic children, particularly in early intervention, and actively sought after by referral sources and families alike. The response was immediate - ANNA's first location was profitable within 3 months of opening. In total we spent $57,481.99 to breakeven on the location, and 1 year later we generated $1,000,000+ in annualized profit at that one center. The 18x+ return on investment was remarkable, but the profit stream from center one was worth far more than just $1,000,000. Applying a 10% cost of capital, this cash flow stream was worth over $10 million on that same ~$57,000 of investment, representing a 185x+ return on investment.

| (/) ANNA Investment | (57,482) |
| **Return-on-Investment** | **185.2x** |

Leaning into our vision where every autistic child has access to a comprehensive, evidence-based and neuroaffirming care, ANNA has accelerated growth to layer on vectors of growth. Growth of clients in each of our centers compounds on growth of the number of centers in our market, which now compounds on growth of the number of markets. Each exponential curve layering on top of the other to compound the aggregate growth curve. The goal by year-end 2029 is to open 180 locations across 12 states, representing $603.8 million in annual recurring revenue. Applying an EBITDA margin of 33%, this represents ~$200 million in EBITDA which, at a 10x multiple, is $2 billion in enterprise value.

# ANNA Playbook

There are four main functions that are core advantages for ANNA:

1.  We have a repeatable scalable approach to delivering high quality services,
2.  We have repeatable and scalable methodologies to recruit and develop clinical talent,
3.  We have repeatable, scalable, profitable channels of getting in touch with families, and
4.  We have a repeatable and advantaged approach to payor network development

Rather than evaluating these independently, the core advantage arose from the compounding benefit of layering each upon the other. When ANNA got started, the Naturalistic Developmental Behavioral Intervention (NDBI) model had not previously been implemented outside of an academic setting (note that other clinical models have been advertised but are not true to the clinical guidelines). The superior clinical model was the initial wedge into attracting both the best talent - who were looking for a better way of delivering services - and families. Due to the extensive word-of-mouth between both clinicians and between families, ANNA compounded growth to both clinicians and to families. Substantial training and development infrastructure further accelerated the quality of clinical services and talent, thus attracting more families.

## Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale Scores by Domain

| Domain | ANNA | Cortica | NADR |
| :-------------------------- | :--- | :------ | :--- |
| Adaptive Behavior Composite (ABC) | 3.3 | 1.4 | 0.1 |
| Communication | 4.0 | 2.0 | 0.3 |
| Socialization | 7.0 | 1.4 | (0.6) |
| Daily Living Skills | 2.8 | 1.1 | 0.2 |

As we began collecting clinical outcomes data, the performance of the model spoke for itself, creating an increasingly compelling value proposition to payors to contract with ANNA at favorable terms, a structural margin advantage that could then be reinvested into the clinical staff for a differentiated value proposition to an otherwise staffing-constrained environment. (ANNA's commercial rates are 20 - 40% higher than rack rates).

This brand-led flywheel was the foundation with which ANNA was initially founded to accelerate growth and generate economies of scale. All of this changed when AI was introduced into the business. The incorporation of AI across every function - including the clinical care delivery itself - within ANNA represented a tectonic shift in the operating business model, scalability, and margin profile of the business.

# ANNA Technology Strategy

The first application of ANNA's AI technology suite was on the operational side of the business, incorporating an AI voice agent for intakes and using web and voice agents for benefit verification, eligibility checks, and prior authorizations. The impact was immediate - the entire RCM function is a funnel wherein any points of misalignment result in denials, ultimately impacting cash flow. The uplift in clean claims from more accurate eligibility and benefit verification as well as prior authorizations results in a ~6% increase in net collections, ultimately driving cash flow yield.

## AI Intake and Revenue Cycle Management

| Metric | Status Quo | AI Powered | Delta |
| :------------------------------- | :------------------ | :---------------- | :---------- |
| **Patient Intake** | | | |
| Patient Intake Completion Time | 15-20 min / patient | 5 min or less | ↓67%+ |
| Patient Intake Data Accuracy | 85% | 99% | ↑14% |
| **Eligibility and Benefits** | | | |
| Eligibility Verification Time | 10 min / patient | Instant | ↓100% |
| Verification Accuracy | 90% | 99% | ↑9% |
| **Prior Authorizations** | | | |
| Prior Auth Submission Time | 30-60 min | Instant | ↓100% |
| Denials from Eligibility/Auth Errors | 8% | 2% | ↓6% |
| **Other** | | | |
| Net Collections Improvement | – | +2-4% | ↑6-8% |

The second application of ANNA's AI technology suite is on the clinical side of the business. While operational AI has the opportunity to drive substantial centralized savings, the greatest opportunity for the applications of AI is on the clinical side of the business - actively improving care quality and gross margin. Healthcare services is by and large a business with operating leverage - provider-level economics drive unit level profitability and aggregate profitability. With provider costs fixed, incremental revenue has a substantially outsized impact on the P&L of a services asset. A highly compelling opportunity exists to create dedicated AI agents that automate and streamline non-clinical activities to enhance the revenue throughput that falls directly to the bottom line. To illustrate this, here is the impact of ANNA's clinical AI suite:

# ANNA Clinical AI Margin Uplift

| **% Margin** | **10.8%** | **40.5%** | **29.7%** |

BCBAs have historically been viewed as a cost structure or margin sink on the ABA business, which is why caseloads stretch to unsustainable levels. In ANNA's case, we were able to identify all of the non-clinical activities that BCBAs were spending their time on and automate them by creating purpose-build AI agents. The first such tool built at ANNA is Blueprint, an AI Treatment Plan generator that streamlines the process of writing treatment plans for clients. These treatment plans were reported to take 12 hours each for our clinicians, with only 3 hours of allocated billable time. This 9 hour delta every 6-months for up to 12 clients amounted to over $25,000 in annual lost revenue per BCBA. With the introduction of Blueprint, BCBAs can not only streamline the treatment plan writing process incorporating AI, our data model centralizes every treatment plan and every client's information to build a vector database that we actively conduct RAG on to improve the quality of the model.

The implications of these tools is not only a substantial uplift in BCBA-level and center-level profitability, but also a simultaneous investment into the clinical quality of services delivered at ANNA. The biggest limit on scalability of a novel clinical model is the extensive lift required to train and continually monitor + develop the clinical practices of an increasingly large workforce.

With the utilization of an AI LMS for initial training, AI fidelity for continual monitoring, and AI treatment planning for quality coordination, this limiter has not only been removed but entirely reversed. This infrastructure is both infinitely scalable and reinforcing in value - continually ingesting and improving. Going back to our four vectors of success, best-in-class clinical quality with fewer working hours drives referrals, recruiting, and payor relationships.

The implications of the reinforcing benefit of AI at the ANNA operating level indicate a fundamental change in the potential margin profile of healthcare services companies. Once trending between 15 - 25% EBITDA margins, AI has created substantial leverage on the business to achieve 40% EBITDA margins - in line with leading software businesses.

This is not well understood. The far and away most common path for a company embracing AI today is to build the application layer on top of the foundational models rather than to vertically integrate into owning the economics of the end customer. While I believe that this will make for a number of highly valuable businesses, there are three key insights that make vertical integration a more compelling opportunity:

1.  Within healthcare, AI at the application layer struggles from a last-mile problem. Healthcare companies tend to be too idiosyncratic in their workflows and technology stacks for a pure horizontal application to address the underlying requirement. For example, we couldn't purchase an AI treatment plan automation tool off-the-shelf because our clinical model is unique and the EMR into which we integrate is customized. The most common way to address the last mile problem is through a forward-deployment GTM, but this adds significant cost, which leads to:
2.  Pricing power for AI applications is generally limited. The perception is because these companies are effectively reselling compute with a front-end, but my perspective is that the issue actually lies with the replacement cost. The traditional software business relied on economies of scale to drive value to their end customers. They'd invest considerable resources into R&D that create a substantial replacement cost, thus earning them the right to charge high prices for licenses. With the cost of development collapsing as a result of increasingly effective AI tooling, the replacement cost of insourcing a previously outsourced AI application is substantially lower.
3.  Lastly, the profit pools themselves have expanded so drastically that the point of leverage is in the residual owner of that profit pool rather than the tooling that enables the creation of it. For the reason above, AI applications create exceptional amounts of value, but the dollar amount of that value is largely accruing to the customer.

Where there has more recently been activity on the implications of AI transformation is in the venture-financed M&A playbook; however, this model is transient as the acquiring multiples expand to the perception of fair market value. Further, an M&A playbook leveraging AI can acquire a 20% margin asset at 10x, double margin to 40% and flip for 10x to generate a 2x return, but the real value creation occurred at the original owner-level when the de novo they built for a 0.5x was sold for 10x (or 15x, when it becomes clear to the owner what the buyer is underwriting to).

# The Opportunity

The four core advantages for ANNA of: 1) Clinical services, 2) Recruiting, 3) Referrals, and 4) Payor Networks that both created a compounding advantage and are significantly accelerated as a function of AI are not specific to ANNA. These core competencies are unique across all healthcare services companies representing $2.5 trillion in annual spend segmented into dozens of specialties and hundreds of sub-markets.

The opportunity is to scale the compelling de novo healthcare services playbook across adjacent specialties by leveraging a centralized platform for the repeatable creation of category-defining, AI-enabled healthcare services businesses, henceforth known as Blueprint Health. (This would be initiated by converting ANNA into a wholly-owned OpCo of the Blueprint Health HoldCo). To do so, there are three key pillars: 1) People, 2) Playbooks, and 3) Product.

# People

The infrastructure to consistently build world class teams has been institutionalized in a number of different instances. The best comparable to the model I will propose is Alpine Investors' Executive Talent Program. Alpine has systematized the recruiting and training of various executives, mainly from leading business schools. The Investors-in-Residence (IIR) model recruits investment professionals to consistently ideate and diligence company ideas. The CEO-in-Training (CIT) model recruits young professionals into the business to join at the earliest days into an Alpine portfolio company. The CEO-in-Residence (CIR) model recruits experienced CEOs to join the Alpine businesses and run them, often with a CIT in direct support as a GM. Another relevant comp in talent development is Palantir, which originated the "Forward Deployed Engineer" model to effectively train a product-minded full-stack engineer in the underlying Palantir products and then build the last mile into their enterprise and defense customer's workflows and technology stacks.

In creating a world-class talent development engine, Blueprint can centralize a pod of the following individuals:

1.  **Investor-in-Residence (IIR):** Tasked with consistently conducting comprehensive diligence across specialties and markets to identify opportunities that fit specific requirements. Recruited from leading venture capital and private equity firms for more entrepreneurial exposure.
2.  **CEO-in-Training (CIT):** O-to-1 operational specialists who can be trained in the Blueprint playbooks to stand up new businesses and transform concepts into companies, with the potential to join in a GM role. Recruited from the mid-tier level of leading multi-site healthcare companies such as Regional Operations Director or Division Vice President for more company ownership.
3.  **Forward-Deployed Engineer (FDE):** Product-minded full-stack AI engineer with the ability to build the centralized elements of the Blueprint product suite and deploy the last-mile integrations to fit the requirements of the operating companies. Recruited from other AI companies for greater ownership, responsibility, entrepreneurial experience.

Once the Initial business is up and running with an AI native technology stack and mature unit-level economics, a CEO-in-Residence (CIR) can be installed with extensive former experience as a C-Suite executive at multi-site healthcare company to accelerate growth across markets. Lastly, prior to launch, a significant investment should be made into identifying and attracting the previous leaders of a given specialty to serve as on the Board of Directors - creating substantial leverage for the operators.

| | Investor-in-Residence (IIR) | CEO-in-Training (CIT) | Forward Deployed Engineer (FDE) |
| :---------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Blueprint Health** | • Former venture capital / private equity investor <br> • Focus on deep, comprehensive diligence on market opportunities for new operating companies <br> • Support on 0-to-1 launch and discovery | • Former multi-site healthcare P&L owner (regional operations director or equivalent) <br> • Focus on standing up companies operationally and 0-to-1 <br> • Join the operating company as GM | • Full-stack AI engineer with deep product knowledge <br> • Focus on last mile integration of Blueprint products into HoldCo <br> • Initially joins operating company for deployment before rotating back |
| **Operating Company** | **Board of Directors** | **General Manager** | **CEO-in-Residence (CIR)** |
| | • World class board of directors of the "Mount Rushmore" of specialty recruited as advisors <br> • Board compensated in operating company equity to support IIR in diligence and business launch then CIT and CIR in business launch | • CIT joins OpCo as first general manager <br> • CIT proves out initial business model in initial market <br> • Responsible for day-to-day operations of the first site/market: patient intake, staffing, contracting, compliance, and financial performance. | • Recruited into the OpCo once the business model is validated and early unit economics are proven. <br> • CIR tasked with building repeatable infrastructure for scaling the business across markets and specialties <br> • Becomes the long-term CEO of the operating company, with Blueprint retaining board and platform support. |

# Playbooks

Healthcare services companies sit on top of several key functions that all must be perfected in order to build a scalable and impactful company. Each of these distinct functions lends themselves well toward a centralized playbook that is reinforced in value with scale as it is applied and iterated upon. These include:

1.  **Market selection:** Identifying attractive geographies by analyzing reimbursement dynamics (commercial and Medicaid), labor availability and cost, competitive density, and regulatory environment. Strong market selection ensures favorable economics and reduces operational friction.
2.  **Sub-market selection:** Pinpointing the most promising neighborhoods or catchment areas within a broader market. This involves evaluating referral networks, payer mix distribution, local demographics, transportation access, and unmet demand for services.
3.  **Real-estate operations:** Securing, developing, and managing clinic sites in a way that optimizes accessibility, patient experience, and cost efficiency. Includes site selection, lease negotiations, and facility build-outs.
4.  **Payor contracting:** Negotiating and managing relationships with commercial and government payers to secure favorable rates, predictable reimbursement, and access to patient populations. This also includes exploring value-based arrangements and navigating payer-specific policies.
5.  **Recruiting clinical talent:** Building and maintaining a steady pipeline of qualified clinicians. This function encompasses sourcing, employer branding, competitive compensation design, and structured onboarding processes to ensure strong retention.
6.  **Attracting referrals:** Developing and nurturing referral relationships with physicians, schools, hospitals, and community organizations. Effective playbooks for institutionalizing referral generation and outreach management.
7.  **Clinical fidelity:** Ensuring that care delivery adheres to evidence-based protocols and the organization's standards of excellence. This includes clinician training, outcome measurement, quality assurance, and continuous improvement programs to protect both patient outcomes and brand reputation.
8.  **Revenue cycle management:** Managing the full billing lifecycle - from insurance verification and prior authorization to coding, claims submission, denial management, and collections. Strong RCM ensures revenue capture, accelerates cash flow, and minimizes write-offs.

Centralized playbooks deployed into each of the operating companies are uniquely valuable in this space because there are so many points of leverage. As compared to enterprise software wherein the playbooks around product development, sales, and customer success are largely established, healthcare has historically been inefficient. This inefficiency creates opportunity for compounding advantages across functions.

# Product

Lastly, centralized product is what transforms services assets into category defining businesses. Just as the core playbooks of healthcare services are extensible to the last mile, the core products are extensible as well. Blueprint is well positioned to occupy a Palantir-like model of developing a centralized set of operational and clinical products that can then be deployed into the unique stacks and workflows of the operating companies for maximum leverage. Products that are common across specialties and create significant leverage include:

1.  **AI Scribe:** Automatically generates structured clinical documentation from patient-clinician interactions, reducing administrative burden and improving accuracy.
2.  **AI Clinical Decision Support:** Automates clinical recommendations at the point-of-care for superior clinical outcomes
3.  **AI Fidelity:** Monitors clinical care delivery to ensure adherence to clinical protocols and improve quality of services
4.  **AI LMS:** Delivers personalized training modules and adaptive learning for clinicians and staff, reinforcing best practices and reducing variability in care.
5.  **AI Care Coordination:** Coordinates discharge and post-discharge activities as well as navigates handoffs for patients to care team
6.  **AI Referral Management:** Tracks, scores, and nurtures referral sources to strengthen relationships and improve growth.
7.  **AI Eligibility Checks:** Instantly verifies patient coverage and plan details, preventing claim denials and delays at the point of intake.
8.  **AI Benefit Verification:** Automates detailed confirmation of covered services, co-pays, and deductibles to ensure financial transparency for patients and providers.
9.  **AI Prior Authorization:** Automates prior authorization requests by pre-populating forms, submitting requests, and tracking payer responses.
10. **AI Scheduling:** Optimizes provider schedules and patient appointments to maximize capacity utilization while reducing wait times and no-shows.
11. **AI Patient Engagement:** Uses tailored communication to improve attendance, adherence, and long-term patient retention.
12. **AI Intake:** Automates initial intake and patient onboarding by capturing key criteria and integrating directly into scheduling, EHR, and RCM workflows to improve conversion.

# Why Now

AI has unlocked an entirely new frontier within healthcare services, an opportunity to transform care delivery via the repeatable creation of category-defining healthcare businesses. The opportunity for Blueprint Health compounds the remarkable de novo economics that we've already proven at ANNA and sets a foundational opportunity to leverage the core infrastructure to build a generational company creation engine. The $2.5 trillion healthcare services market is ripe for innovation - delivering a transformative experience for patients and providers alike. This transformation begins with the clinical model itself - AI has enabled the transformation of clinical care delivery to be aligned with the highest quality, evidence-based practice at scale via tools like AI LMS, AI clinical fidelity, and AI wraparound clinical care delivery plugging the gaps between care.

During my time at Triple Aim Partners, I was involved in building four companies from the ground up - Oasis Health and Diverge Health in the capitated primary care MSO markets and Guidelight and Steadfast in the multi-site behavioral business. Collectively these companies are worth over $1.5 billion and scaling rapidly leveraging the TAP core infrastructure. This same infrastructure was responsible for both of TAPs first two companies exiting for over $1 billion - Prospero and ArchWell. AI has created an opportunity to build businesses that far exceed even the TAP business trajectories with compounding centralized advantages and superior and reinforcing clinical value.

The next three companies for Blueprint to launch are the following:

1.  **Pediatric Multi-Specialty Mental Health NewCo:** combine Parent-Management Training (PMT) with Modular CBT (MCBT), creating a specialized model where parents become the primary agents of change in addressing pediatric conditions such as ADHD, oppositional defiant disorder, anxiety, and depression. This integrated framework layers individual therapy, psychiatry-driven medication management, and structured group IOP/PHP programming with PMT's parent-led interventions, ensuring therapeutic strategies are consistently reinforced at home and across settings. AI delivers adaptive parent training modules, real-time fidelity monitoring of parent-child interactions, and supplemental parent coaching between sessions, enabling higher adherence and more scalable outcomes than traditional clinician-only models. This family-centered, multi-specialty approach directly addresses the shortages in pediatric behavioral health and unlocks transformative potential in a fragmented $30bn+ U.S. pediatric mental health market growing at double-digit rates.
2.  **Adolescent Multi-Specialty Behavioral Addiction NewCo:** integrate Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Internet and Gaming Disorders (CBT-IGD) with Multidimensional Family Therapy (MDFT) to create the most comprehensive and evidence-based model for adolescents struggling with compulsive gaming, gambling, pornography, and social media use. CBT-IGD provides structured, skills-based interventions to reshape maladaptive cognitions and build adaptive coping strategies, while MDFT addresses the multidimensional influences of family, peers, and school environments, ensuring treatment is reinforced across every part of the adolescent's life. Group-based IOP/PHP programming further enhances outcomes by providing structured peer accountability and skill practice in a supportive setting. AI augments this framework by delivering adaptive CBT skill-practice modules, providing fidelity tools to ensure clinicians adhere to evidence-based protocols, and equipping families with AI-supported coaching to reinforce MDFT strategies between sessions. With current treatments for behavioral addictions often limited to fragmented or non-clinical interventions, this NewCo defines the first scalable, evidence-based continuum of care in a $15bn+ adolescent behavioral addiction market, meeting a rapidly growing and unmet need.
3.  **Adolescent Multi-Specialty Eating Disorder NewCo:** anchors in Family-Based Treatment (FBT), the gold-standard, evidence-based model for adolescent eating disorders, offering the most effective framework for anorexia, bulimia, binge-eating, and avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder. FBT empowers parents to lead recovery by taking charge of meals and weight restoration, but its real-world impact has been limited: few community therapists are formally trained in FBT, and many families struggle with the intensity of assuming responsibility. This NewCo solves both challenges by layering FBT with individual therapy and group-based IOP/PHP programming, and by using AI to expand scalability — delivering structured training modules so every clinician can learn and adhere to true FBT protocols, deploying fidelity tools that reinforce clinical quality, and offering adaptive parent coaching and psychoeducation that prepare and support caregivers to succeed in their central role. With demand for adolescent eating disorder treatment surging post-pandemic and most families facing long waitlists or diluted, non-evidence-based therapy, this NewCo defines the first scalable, truly evidence-based continuum of care in a $10bn+ adolescent eating disorder market, directly addressing both access and fidelity gaps.
