GC Perspective

Duopoly market controlled by 	ClaimsXten (~50% share) and Optum 	CES (~40% share)
Low-growth cash extraction business – 	driven by membership growth, inflation, 	and riskier population
~100% gross retention market, difficult 	to displace incumbents

Requires customization to expand 	scope of specialty edits
Primary innovation is through AI- 	enablement (to optimize labor)
Machinify has churned customers due 	to lack of healthcare focus
ClaimLogiq more of a PE roll-up similar 	to CES/Equian

Most attractive segment to invest behind
Share of PI savings likely going to shift 	more to pre-pay over next 5 years
Large-cap plans mostly captured by 	Change, Cotiviti, and Zelis focusing on 	TPAs
Smaller players likely have to displace 	incumbents and/or pursue long tail

Market shifting away from post-pay due 	to provider abrasion from pay & chase
Limited innovation given everyone is 	aware of broader shifts away from post- 	pay

Vendor management is interesting 	given increased “tiering” of PI vendors
Concerns around conflict of interest and 	potentially playing both sides of the coin
UM-focused solutions suffer from end- 	user being different than end-payor, and 	lack of full panel deployment of services

## Slide 3

PI Shift to Pre-Pay

Today, the split of savings within PI is ~40% pre-pay / ~60% post-pay vs. it being virtually nonexistent ~5-10 years ago. The recent shift has been entirely driven by demands from end-payor clients
Going forward, as provider abrasion becomes more and more of a focus area due to consolidation, payors will continue to desire limitations of pay & chase. Pre-pay share could grow to ~60% over the next 3-5 	years
Post-pay also commands a higher-level of service as they must handle provider communication and relationships with collection agencies

Business Models

Today, the incumbents generate ~30-40% EBITDA margins across CE/PI, with positive working capital dynamics and limited CapEx / CapSW, leading to FCF margins that are ~80-100% of EBITDA
Payors are starting to consider insourcing components of CE/PI given the significant amount of external payments. Particularly, labor components of PI may be insourced as payors want to own more and 	more of the communication channel with providers, and would instead prefer SaaS platforms that enable and flag PI
Generally, the underlying growth within the CE/PI space is ~4-6% per year, with minor annual escalators on the licensing side and ~2-3% CPIU + ~1-2% risk on the contingency fee side, coupled with ~flat
membership growth in commercial, ~1-3% growth in MMC, and ~3-5% in MA
While gross-churn is limited, there is a reasonable risk of net-churn within the PI space as providers get smarter on areas of savings from the payor lens. Thus, a PI vendor must continue to innovate on rules / 	clinical policies to refresh savings opportunities on a YoY basis

Automation Opportunity

The largest drop-off between gross margins of 70-80% is the manual service component required to conduct IBR/chart reviews. If this can be sufficiently automated for a higher % of cases, the steady-state 	margin could potentially expand into the 50%+ range
Vendors like Machinify who are AI/ML first and healthcare-second have started to struggle in the marketplace. They have the view that the best technology should win, without understand some of the broader 	KBFs of payors

Tiering Dynamics

A national health plan will have a plethora of CE/PI vendors. Typically, they vend one primary CE vendor, one secondary CE vendor, and ~3-5 PI vendors on either pre-pay or post-pay. Once you start to go
downstream, a regional MCO plan may only have 2-4 vendors total, and a SMID TPA would only have 1-2 vendors
Health plans always tier their savings payments based on the “pass tier;” someone like Optum or ClaimsXten would only receive 1-5% of savings since they do a baseline automated pass. From there, a 	primary/secondary pass will typically collect 10-25% of savings, with certain tertiary and quaternary players collecting ~30-50%+ of savings

Areas for Innovation

There exists a significant opportunity to develop FWA solutions targeted towards payments in a VBC setting (vs. FFS). Traditional CE/PI only works in a FFS setting. The only issue with developing VBC- 	centric FWA solutions is determining who will pay for the service, as FWA in VBC constructs tends to benefit both the provider and payor (e.g., member attribution, risk adjustment)
ClarisHealth acts as a router for the payment integrity stack, providing performance reports. Have succeeded with large health plans who have wide stacks, but have limited penetration within smaller-scale players. 	Considering an expansion into formal PI through overflow services.
Capabilities that are used in PI such as determining stratifying bills / claims by denial likelihood can also be deployed to providers to provide visibility into likelihood of paid vs. billed amounts. An 	RCM solution like Anomaly can then help providers to optimize collections upfront (vs. post-pay disputes)
There also exists an opportunity to expand into the Rx side (vs. just medical), but penetration here is limited with Cotiviti having a head start

Competitive
Considerations

Fundamentally, no one is going to disrupt the primary claims editing landscape. ClaimsXten and Optum CES own ~90% of the market, and have never churned a customer historically. Similarly, Cotiviti along 	with Change owns ~80% of the PI market, particularly in the post-pay setting
Zelis is rapidly expanding and capturing the mid-size TPA and regional MCO space. Historically been an untapped market with low service levels from incumbents as they simply viewed the CAC as too high

Go-To-Market Considerations

Change has historically suffered with RCM churn due to conflicts of interest where it was the PI vendor and the RCM vendor for the provider in disputes. This could pose a risk to a player like Anomaly as
they scale
Selling to providers tends to have longer sales cycle and lower ACVs due to higher fragmentation. In contrast, selling to payors results in customer concentration risk (albeit with low churn)
Going after the long-tail of Blues is also attractive since they are traditionally ignored by the large incumbents, and there is significant word-of-mouth opportunity through the BCBSA
