### CuraFi Platform Vision

- Building comprehensive workflow automation platform for healthcare ops
	- Solving admin cost increases vs declining revenue problem
	- Targeting interconnected workflows: prior auth → rev cycle → care management → risk adjustment
	- Multiple AI agents working together vs single point solutions
- Key differentiator: Understanding complete healthcare workflow
	- Partner Claire is physician with operational experience
	- Most AI health founders are technical but lack healthcare ops knowledge
	- Current solutions create “digital pile up” instead of solving workflow issues
- Platform triggers approach: one input automatically updates multiple systems
	- Example: OCR → AI processing → distribution to correct departments
	- Eliminates manual work for LPNs and office staff

### Market Approach & Partnerships

- Hybrid build vs buy strategy still evolving
	- Will integrate existing solutions where commoditized
	- Building core workflow orchestration and case management logic
	- Focus on maximizing ROI vs revenue and acuity optimization
- Partnership with AltaMed (largest FQHC in US)
	- Need help with patient waitlist management and walk-ins
	- Revenue cycle optimization priority
	- Dinner meeting setup with their CEO
- Comparison to current market solutions:
	- Most are point solutions that don’t integrate workflows
	- Tech debt prevents expansion beyond original use case
	- Voice agents can’t process PDFs; PDF tools can’t make calls

### Strategic Positioning

- Targeting “Gen 2” approach vs current single-agent companies
	- Current market: 95% accuracy on basic tasks like prior auth
	- Opportunity: connecting commoditized tools into unified platform
	- Risk: Complex build requiring deep healthcare and tech expertise
- Vision: Becoming healthcare infrastructure back office
	- Unified AI-powered operations platform
	- 20-25% success rate would “set new standard”
	- Ops people love concept; tech people see implementation challenges
