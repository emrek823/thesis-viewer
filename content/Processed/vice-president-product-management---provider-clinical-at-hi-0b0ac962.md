**Client**
Hi. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me. I am conducting some research on healthcare and AI start-ups. I don't know if you've heard any of these like Latent or Plenful or Mandolin or Silna. We've heard that Abridge is going to release a prior auth product. Now that it's public, we're excited to chat to learn more about how people are using it. Just to get started, I'd love to get started just to hear a bit about your role and background, maybe the 30-second intro.

**Expert**
Yeah. My role at Highmark, VP of product management. Areas I support are our clinical capabilities and provider capability set, so for clinical product management around utilization management and care management, disease management, case management. For provider product management functions around end-to-end provider capabilities across front-end provider credentialing, provider contracting, provider reimbursement, our provider portals all the way through payer-provider interoperability and a wide variety of provider data management and chat type of capabilities as well.

**Client**
Yeah. It's excellent. More specifically on Abridge, I'm curious how long you've been using Abridge. When did you first start using the prior auth product? How long did the implementation process take? Things like that.

**Expert**
Yeah. We're a payer provider. I sit at the parent company across both payer and provider areas. We have been live, and we own our provider system that's owned at Allegheny Health Network, AHN, which is a Pittsburgh-based provider system. Let's say, probably about, two, two and a half years ago is when we started the evaluation process of ambient vendors at that time. Had Suki up and running and live and decided to conduct an RFP and evaluate a broad group of Abridge, Ambience, Augmedix, Nabla, Suki, and a few others at that time. We narrowed down into three, Ambience, Abridge, and Suki for a live POC.

I've had that up and running with Abridge for probably a little over a year and have that focused on three different cohorts, so about 200 end users, providers for each of those products. Recently, at the provider system, we did decide to move forward with Abridge as the primary vendor for ambient capabilities for that provider system.

**Client**
Great. When did you first start using the prior auth module?

**Expert**
We're actually in process of codeveloping that prior auth module with them.

**Client**
Interesting. Could you share any details you can about what that looks like? Is it very early stages and the goals of codevelopment?

**Expert**
Yeah. It is still relatively early stage. We'll be starting with a narrow subset of prior auth services and codes and really starting with, "Hey, making at point of care available, is a prior auth required for XYZ procedure? What are the rules around our medical policies and clinical guidelines around a prior authorization for that specific thing at the point of care through Abridge?"

**Client**
Yeah. That's really interesting. I'm curious. Why did you choose to partner with Abridge and codevelop a solution rather than use one of these other prior auth specific start-ups?

**Expert**
Yeah. Most of the prior auth specific start-ups, they address a different aspect of the prior auth workflow. They really focus on after a patient encounter, after a doctor has seen a patient, the order entry and then the prior auth process on the back end right now. Bringing another vendor into the up-front portion of a clinical workflow is going to be really challenging. When we're starting to determine which vendor do we want to go scale with across some of the ones that I'd mentioned earlier from an ambient perspective, we started looking at innovation and co-development opportunities.

This was one of the biggest things, given a lot of the work that we've already done in the prior auth space over the last year, year and a half. That was the most interesting opportunity with Abridge to bring that forward earlier in the workflow. I think our theory and hypothesis was it's going to be really hard for a prior auth vendor to either integrate or build ambient capabilities versus the opposite.

**Client**
I just want to play that back to make sure I'm understanding, and feel free to say that I'm incorrect in my understanding. You're saying that the current prior auth vendors, essentially, you have the clinician that takes the notes, puts in the order, it gets sent to the PA team. At that point, they're using some automation tools to automate the process once it gets to the prior auth team.

---

**Expert**
Correct.

**Client**
The vision for developing with Abridge is that actually at the point of care, you can just have the clinicians send in the prior auth request immediately based on the notes that they've just taken, is that correct?

**Expert**
Actually, I'd say, it's a little bit different than that. It would be, first, even identifying for the clinician when they're interacting with the patient to say, "Hey, you're talking to your doctor." Your doctor says, "Hey, I think you need an MRI," or "I think you need a knee replacement," or whatever the thing is, be able to determine at that point, "Hey, for this patient, depending on what their insurance is, is it Cigna, is it Aetna, is it Highmark, is it something else, does that specific procedure require prior authorization?"

If it does, have we actually identified all of the clinically relevant things to get that authorization approved? If not, remind and nudge the provider right there when the patient is in front of them to say, "Actually, this authorization isn't going to get approved right now because we haven't met X or Y that are clinical guidelines for your payer. We actually need to do something up front."

That is the vision of what we're trying to do with Abridge to say, "Right now, all of that happens on the back end." The provider is going to say, "Okay, I'm going to put an order in." It goes to a rev cycle team or a prior auth team. They try to create the authorization. It either gets flagged on the provider side or goes to the payer. The payer then says, "Yep, you didn't meet one of our five criteria, so go back and then either update your documentation on why it meets that criteria," or "Go order something else before we would approve that thing."

The cycle time gets really, really long. That's what drives the frustration around the prior auth process versus if you can bring that so far left and so far up front in that workflow where the patient and the clinician are having a conversation. They get flagged right there to say, "No, didn't meet these two, so this is what we're going to do instead." After that is done, we will get the prior auth approved immediately. Does that make sense?

**Client**
Yeah. The goal is actually with the Abridge partnership not to automate prior auth, but to remove the need for the back and forth between the admin team and the clinicians. The goal is really to take the burden off of the clinician so that they don't have to get a call from either the payer or the PA team.

**Expert**
Yeah. There's a lot of products that do aspects of this on the back end right now as well. They will check if the auth is required. They will check the documentation. They will nudge the auth team or someone else to say you didn't have this. They will go check status of an authorization. If it hasn't gotten approved, it will go re-nudge the payer. There's a lot of products that do that aspect of it right now. There's really no one that's addressing this all the way up front.

**Client**
Yeah. It's really interesting. One that does make sense. A quick question, when we hear all these stats about the administrative spend on prior auth, is that primarily driven by this back and forth between admin payers and clinicians? The logic would go if you can remove the need for the clinician to be involved, that you can cut a lot of the spend on administrative workers by doing that?

**Expert**
I don't think that there's nearly as big of an administrative spend and reduction opportunity in prior auth given my five years of work on the provider side. The challenge on the provider side is at least, and this depends on each provider system a little bit, but most providers, they might have a small centralized team that does auth, but then there's a lot of other disparate, off processes that happen across a broader function.

---

You might have a MA or a front desk staff member in a practice or facility that they spend 10% of their time doing authorizations.

It requires a pretty significant operating model shift and full process redesign for you to get really significant admin savings. With the provider systems I've worked with, you can get probably $500,000, $1 million, $1.5 million. You're not going to drive $10 million, $20 million, $30 million, $40 million in admin savings from prior auth reduction on the admin side specifically in my expertise or my understanding of all the work that I've been doing.

**Client**
Yeah. That's consistent with what we've heard of the $500,000-$1 million, $2 million in savings. A two-part question here. One, what do you estimate your prior auth spend to be today? Maybe that's just a by-product of how many admin workers you have working on that problem in a centralized team. Two, what do you expect the ROI to be from the Abridge product?

**Expert**
On the ROI, we didn't evaluate this specific thing from a near-term ROI perspective. Like I mentioned, this was a kind of innovation co-development opportunity that's a long-term strategic play rather than, "Hey, we are expecting a one-year, three-year ROI of X right now from launching this kind of solution."

It's a little bit more strategic also. It's expediting care to say reduction in delays of care because of that prior auth process. It's really hard to quantify something like that to say, "Hey, Joe didn't get his MRI. Because he didn't get his MRI, because it took three weeks or a month and a half of back and forth," I'm making it up, "his knee got a lot worse right now." We actually incurred a lot more cost of managing Joe or for the provider system, something didn't happen in that type of scenario as well.

There's a lot more of that type of thinking that we think that there's going to see value than, say, I'm going to go drive another three FTEs, five FTEs. All the people that do this type of work from an admin prior auth perspective, these are people that you pay $30,000, $40,000, $50,000, $60,000 to. It's not like they're going to remove 200 people from a department that do this type of work.

**Client**
Interesting. Basically, what I'm trying to balance is we spent a lot of time with prior auth-specific companies, and we've seen incredible demand for those companies because the prior auth process, like you said, it's high pain point. They've got maybe 10-20 employees working on this, and they can reduce that meaningfully by automating 80% of the prior auths with AI. The sense I get from this conversation is that, eventually, if you can just integrate this, all the right questions, into the Abridge platform, you can remove the need for those kinds of platforms. Is that a fair opinion that you hold?

**Expert**
Yeah. I would agree with that. Abridge is not doing the actual submission of the authorization to whichever payer that they work with. That would happen through a number of different mechanisms. That could happen through Epic payer platform. That could happen through another vendor. That could happen directly from the EMR. That could happen through Building 278, Building 275, and CMS, FHIR capabilities.

There's a bunch of things out there that could do the transmission of that stuff, but it's kind of the up-front intelligence and where their expertise is on ambient intelligence, ambient listening, to listen to the conversation and determine the needs and be able to nudge the provider. That's really where they're focused.

**Client**
Do you see Abridge eventually expanding to do this full-scale prior auth automation piece?

**Expert**
Potentially. I have no information, so this is just my hypothesis. Given how much money that they've raised

---

and everything that's going on right now, I can see them just buying someone to do this type of stuff right now too. I think Shivs even said that. I read a couple articles in the last couple of days where they are potentially interested in making some acquisitions. I could see that probably being potentially a more likely scenario than trying to go build the downstream component of some of this stuff too. No knowledge, that is my speculation purely.

**Client**
Makes sense. We saw that's all public speculation. I'm curious from your perspective, are there any start-ups you've seen or areas you've seen that could be impacted by AI that you would consider purchasing from? I'll have a follow-up question after that.

**Expert**
It's really broad. I'd say there's probably a number that we are already working with or continuing to evaluate across a wide variety of things from provider data upcycling to contact center AI capabilities around agentic solutions. There are a number of ones that we're evaluating, some that we're working with, some that we're in either contracting or discussions at this point, so yes, but without more specifics, it'd be hard for me to pinpoint exactly what those could be.

**Client**
That's super helpful. I'm curious. If you have a computer open or something, could you just check out the website for Latent Health? A purple hexagon is the logo. I'd be curious just to get your thoughts on a company like this. Just what jumps out to you about this company, this website? What are your initial thoughts on the potential for this company?

**Expert**
Initial thoughts, I'd say pharmacy has been a relatively untapped and more challenging but avoided area both from a prior auth and then workflow perspective. There are probably a couple incumbents across Surescripts, CoverMyMeds, and a few others that really try to control that ecosystem. We've had a lot of challenge on pharmacy auth and automation and the pharmacy appeals process and pharmacy benefits. I do think that this is interesting, and this is probably a little bit different than the stuff that we've either worked on and looked at historically in the past. I'd say that's a positive, for sure.

**Client**
That's interesting. Could you dive into the details of that? How specifically is this different from the Abridge partnership you're working on?

**Expert**
If I look at pharmacy prior authorization processing generally happens at least for us, and I think this happens for a lot of vendors through partially as a third party. We control the medical policies or the rules around pharmacy, but a lot of that is still administered or done by a mix of CoverMyMeds or Surescripts or a few other vendors and/or some PBMs right now as well.

I do think there's still probably the opportunity for someone like Abridge to tap into those policies and tap into that so it's a consistent experience for an end user as a clinician and provider. The actual, "How do you get the data? How do you administer that type of stuff," probably still requires a partnership with someone given pharmacy benefits are pretty complex too.

**Client**
Interesting. Theoretically, you were looking to invest in this company, what would the questions you'd want answered for this company before you'd be willing to invest?

**Expert**
This is still targeting mostly health systems. I'm just scrolling through it, partners resources. I think really understanding outside of prior auth where they see the overall opportunity from pharmacy, if their vision is

---

being an end-to-end provider pharmacy platform, how that impacts things like real-time prescription benefits and substitutes from a pharmacy perspective. Is that the broader wheelhouse that they expect to see to be in long term? How does that impact overall ROI from a solution and capability perspective?

I do think you'll see prior auth companies starting to go from medical to pharmacy prior auth. For these guys, rather than going the other way, if they're starting with pharmacy prior auth, how do they expand to the broader pharmacy world from a provider perspective? Again, how do you tie that to bottom-line ROI for a provider system?

To me, the savings in value is less from admin savings. It's really, how do you drive medical cost savings for providers that are in shared risk contracts with a payer to say, "Hey, I'm actually driving better adherence to these five, pharmacy metrics for the contract that I have with UHC right now"? That unlocks $1 million, $2 million, $5 million in bonus payments that I have with whoever that payer is from a med adherence or other things like that as well. I think that would be the other thing I would be looking to understand where they see that going from a value perspective.

**Client**
That's super helpful. I'm curious. This isn't specific to Highmark, but in general, a company like Latent, what would the contract sizes you would estimate they can command from large provider systems? Just from your knowledge in the field, what would you estimate the average and maximum contract size would be?

**Expert**
Yeah. Again, this is my pure speculation. If I look at the medical prior auth types of things right now, those are probably under $1 million. I'd say this is even less than that.

**Client**
Okay. Average less than $1 million.

**Expert**
This is pure guessing. I'd say maybe $300,000-$500,000. Unless they're able to show near-term ROI in a medical cost savings and go at risk for something in those types of ways.

**Client**
Okay. Let's say like the largest providers in the country, would you estimate the maximum contract size to be $1 million-$2 million, then?

**Expert**
Probably at that top end. It's going to be hard to convince a hospital system CFO to shell out more than $1 million for a pharmacy-specific prior auth solution that targets one thing.

**Client**
Got you. It's critical for them to expand the platform to command these massive contracts.

**Expert**
Yeah. If you're thinking about to a certain degree amortizing an implementation to say if it's going to take me three, six, nine, 12 months to go implement this type of solution capability, is this a vendor that I can continue growing with and driving value in other areas right now before I go spend both the time and money on that?

**Client**
That makes sense. Another similar question. Just from your knowledge on the field, nothing Highmark-specific, if the largest pieces of software that providers purchase are the EHR, the EMR, and the RCM tools, I'm curious, just real quick, what would the average spend be for a large provider on those two tools?

---

**Expert**
The EHR-specific spend to like an Epic or Cerner, my understanding and didn't think about our provider system, that amount isn't crazy. I want to say it's probably in the $10 million-$20 million, that's my guess. The overall cost to operate, the total cost of ownership of that EHR is what gets significant. EHR, IT, and analysts, and that entire team that supports that is really a bigger cost than just like the vendor cost for the EHR solution and capability.

From a rev cycle management perspective, most of the providers that we've seen are using primarily either their EHR's built-in capabilities. More and more, we're starting to see people start to just outsource some of the rev cycle capabilities to someone like R1 or others right now as well.

**Client**
Okay. The spend on that, just your speculation for a large provider, would ballpark be?

**Expert**
In general, I think it's like a percentage of rev capture. I think that's a lot more significant probably in the $20 million, $30 million, $40 million, but I think it just depends a little bit on the size of the organization.

**Client**
Makes sense. Are there any other tools besides those two that command $1 million+ contracts?

**Expert**
If I think about coding capabilities, which a lot of the ambient vendors are starting to expand into right now as well, so that's HCC coding and things like that. It's a part of that rev cycle. I think it just depends on if they've outsourced it or using someone to do that. Ambient is the other big one right now that's probably in that range. I think most organizations are replacing what they would have used for just dictation software with someone like a 3M or a Nuance and supplementing that with ambient funding as well, but I think that's the other big one.

**Client**
Excellent. Maybe just a final question or two. If this Abridge prior auth product or project didn't work out. Let's say, for some reason doesn't deliver the ROI that was expected, what would be the thing that caused that to happen?

**Expert**
The biggest one is just their ability to sort through the complexity of all the different payer auth rules and bring those forward in a clean way for a provider to understand. I think that's the question of like, "Are they going to be able to do that? Are they going to have to source that data and that capability from someone else right now to do it at scale?"

For a provider, great. It works for Highmark, but it's really only going to be valuable for providers that works for all the payers that they work with and all the patients that they see so they don't have to think about, "Well, for Highmark, I get this information, but I don't for the other patient that is with United or with Humana or with Aetna or Cigna."

Providers don't want workflows that are really specific to just one patient set because they don't look at a patient and say, "Oh, I'm seeing Joe, and he has this insurance right now." They're seeing a patient as a patient. I think that scalability and being able to do that across an entire patient population is definitely going to be one of the things that is critical, but it's going to be a challenge too.

**Client**
That's amazing. Maybe one real quick question. I know this won't be the contract structure for Highmark because you guys are codeveloping, but for Abridge to sell this prior auth module to another provider, let's say they're spending $1 million a year on scribing, what would you estimate the cost of this prior auth

---

module to be on top of the $1 million a year prescribing?

**Expert**
I don't see them starting to nickel and dime upcharge for each specific. I see it increasing the total cost of ambient. Again, we haven't had this discussion, but I don't speculate. That's what issues have been in the past to say everything is an extra charge right now. I don't think they really want to get into that to say, "Hey, certain big things might have an additional charge, but if they do that, they're going to get torn apart."

They're never going to be best in class. What they're trying to do is being a platform company to be able to offer a wide variety of stuff right now as well. I think, over time, it will just increase the ambient cost and you get these three capabilities or do tiered pricing. I don't know anything about it, if they actually think about this or not, but saying, "Hey, Tier one is these three capabilities, Tier two is one of these five capabilities, and Tier three is all of the things that we operate now too." Getting bundled in that way.

**Client**
Got it. Thank you so much. Have a good one.
