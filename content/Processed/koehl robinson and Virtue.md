### Company Overview & Business Model

- Celia Health: vertically integrated peptide company with 3 arms
	- Celia Labs: manufacturing partnership with Protixa
	- B2B wholesale/white-labeling for high-volume partners
	- D2C telehealth platform with genetic testing
- 2.5 years building proof of concept before fundraising
- Launched November, scaled rapidly since

### Manufacturing & Product Quality

- Cell culture-based peptides (not synthesized or China imports)
- Two FDA-certified, cGMP compliant facilities:
	- Florida: nasal sprays and powders
	- San Diego: vials and lyophilized powders (being rebuilt)
- Rapid ion technology for nasal sprays
	- 89% absorption rate (comparable to injectable)
	- Extended shelf life
- Only Clotho sourced from BioPepTech (China) - cautious approach due to importation issues

### Top Peptides & Market Programs

- Best sellers:
	- Oxytocin
	- NAD
	- Clothos
	- Bio-identical protein
	- Semaglutide
	- Tirzepatide
	- Glutathione
	- Magnesium
	- Epitalon
- Program-based approach: fertility, hair/skin programs showing strong traction

### Regulatory Compliance Strategy

- Two compliance pathways:
	- 503A pharmacies: Tier 1 list allows top 12 peptides
	- Research/investigational use: requires IRB participation
- All research customers enrolled in IRB studies for data collection
- Third-party medical teams licensed in each prescribing state
- Building 503A pharmacy component in Texas and Florida partnership
- Compliance space very confusing on what’s acceptable
- Crackdown expected on research-only companies and China importation

### B2B Partnerships & Growth

- Major partnerships scaling:
	- Sally: 13,000 products per quarter
	- Elysium Pharmaceuticals
	- Feel Peptides (launching next 3 months)
- White-labeling for Gary Brecka (industry expert validation)
- International expansion: EU and Brazil telehealth sites planned
- One-stop-shop model: manufacturing, labeling, distribution, tech stack

### Fundraising & Market Outlook

- Raising $1.5M seed round, ~50% committed
- $75K minimum investment, targeting September 15th close
- Market projection: 1 in 5 people taking peptides within 3 years
- Focus areas for funding: scalability and digital marketing
- Strategic investors include CPG pharmaceutical executives
