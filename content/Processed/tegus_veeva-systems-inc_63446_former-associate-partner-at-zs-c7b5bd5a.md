* Publication Management
* Product Expansion
* Life Sciences
* Regulatory Requirements
* Market dynamics
* Technology Solutions
* Document Review
* Global Market Access

### Summary
The Tegus Client is interested in expanding their product as a document management and approval system for publications in the life sciences industry. The expert advises considering global business requirements and major markets such as the US, EU5 countries, China, Brazil, and Canada. They highlight the need for configuration to accommodate different regulatory processes and languages. The Tegus Client mentions that their platform is built on a low-code automation platform. The expert explains that Veeva is a popular choice for promotional document review but may have issues with separating medical and commercial activities. Decision-making in this space is driven by factors such as risk tolerance and trust. The expert suggests focusing on being a trusted provider and making the technology approachable to non-technical users. They also mention potential opportunities in market access and value in access. The expert provides a rough estimate of around $500,000 for building a custom publication system app, with ongoing maintenance and licensing costs ranging from $100,000 to $150,000. The conversation also touches on the importance of protecting contracting terms and potential expansion in the R&D space.

**Q: What is your current and past experience in managing document review and approval processes in life sciences organizations?**

A: I have advised many companies over my 13+ years of consulting specifically on these processes. Two of the major processes are MLR - Medical Legal Review - and CMLR, or PRC - Promotional Review Committee / Commercial, Medical, Legal, Regulatory Review. There are others as well, depending on which documents you are referring to for your project.

These processes have very specific requirements from a compliance, legal and regulatory standpoint. I have audited them from a Compliance standpoint; Designed and re-designed them for multiple companies; assessed them in light of CIA requirements and readiness (Corporate Integrity Agreement); submitted materials through the processes for multiple companies; and developed SOPs for the processes. There are other doc review processes related to observational research, market research, clinical research, etc. that I have advised on, designed, and submitted materials through. I have also done document review solution/platform assessments, selection, and implementations.

**Q: Have you used dedicated electronic document management systems or other solutions to manage these processes? Have you worked them manually or used a combination or both?**

A: Yes. They are very rarely done manually anymore, if at all.

**Q: Based on your experience, what have been the advantages and disadvantages of the solutions you've used in the past?**

A: Again it depends on which types of documents are in scope, and the particular requirements for the client. It usually boils down to difference in price; markets (eg languages and customization for OUS markets); data security, compliance and firewalls; and UX, aiming for speed and ease for the overall process.

**Tegus Client**
Hello, thank you so much for taking the time to meet with me today. So we're looking at a company whose flagship product is a publication management product, which is being used by one Fortune 100 pharmaceutical company and about to be implemented at the second Fortune 100 pharma company.

And today, we'd be interested in talking to you about product expansion opportunities, really at its heart as a document management and approval system for publications. It enables publication draft and review, collaborative editing, approval and external stakeholder review without needing the external stakeholder to log in, all while being auditable in a single system. So you could reduce the core elements to build new products around document drafting review and approval for other life sciences processes across departments. So regulatory submissions, research concept approvals, et cetera.

Primarily medical affairs right now, that's correct. I think regulatory affairs and R&D make the most sense right now. I think to start it would be great if you could give us a minute or two on your background.

**Former Associate Partner at ZS Associates**
So I've been in the pharma industry for 17 years. I've been a management consultant within healthcare, primarily to life sciences, pharma. And functionally, the first seven years or so of my consulting career were with PwC. So at PwC, I spent time in really cross-functional effort. So I'm experienced specifically in compliance, regulatory, drug safety, development.

And from PwC, I then went to ZS Associates, another management consulting firm, the majority of ZS' business focused in pharma life sciences. And I continued in all of the same functional areas but then also expanded my focus specifically on global.

So for example, instead of just U.S. value and access, I spent a good deal of time in global market access and global policy, which, as you may or may not be aware, it's very different when we're talking about things that in the U.S. to us, are very clearly designated between medical, R&D, compliance, regulatory. Ex-U.S., it's a lot greyer because of the way the healthcare systems work, obviously.

So that's where the global policy comes in quite a bit. And then from ZS, I went to AESARA, which is a health economics and outcomes research focused firm, which if you're familiar, is one of those areas that kind of straddles both medical and market access functions. And it's really just the health economist, who are doing evidence generation strategy, evidence generation study design, real-world evidence strategy and execution, et cetera.

I'm also on the Board for a health tech and critical decision support service that a company rather that is leveraging AI just like everybody else is in lots of different interesting ways. I might be leaving off a few other relevant roles. I do some independent advising to companies within the digital health space as well as specifically new treatments within the mental health space.

**Tegus Client**
And for the purpose of this call, we're just focusing on the U.S. market right now. Can you walk through like the technologies that you've seen in your consulting work that are solving these kind of document review approval processes needs across the life sciences value chain?

**Former Associate Partner at ZS Associates**
So it really runs the gamut. And I would say, as I walk through it, I'll try to kind of outline where it depends, what are the different variables. So one of the main areas where you'll see a big difference in what companies are using in this space and this one might be pretty obvious to you guys, but in the size and maturity of the company itself.

So not too long ago, mid-sized or pre-commercial companies especially, when it came to specifically medical affairs, document review systems were very rudimentary, primarily a combination of humans and excels to be honest with you, the documents themselves.

Whereas at the end of the spectrum, of course, larger Fortune 100, of course, they are not taking that kind of risk and are using more established platforms such as, for example, Veeva, which I'm sure you guys are familiar with, one of the main players, who I would say is used by 90% of the industry, specifically for promotional documents and approval.

And Veeva is one example, obviously has lots of other competitors, but what ends up happening. Veeva as an example is a platform that they're not trying to lose their market share, right? We are continuously working hand in hand with their clients to build, whatever they need to meet their requirements, they are not switching platforms. So within specifically promotional document review and approval, the established players are very hard to push out.

**Tegus Client**
You're saying that, that if you're looking at promotional review, that's going to be 90% Veeva, at least at the larger firms.

**Former Associate Partner at ZS Associates**
Yes. Here's how it works, right. I know you are focused on just U.S., but one kind of bit of advice I would offer is that you sort of have to think globally too because every pharma company is global. So what happens is ultimately, they don't want a solution that is only customed to their U.S. market. And so as a management consultant, it's ironic because I've had many projects over the years where there will be advocates on the U.S. side, for example, Veeva and then advocates on the global side, they'll bring us in to do a third-party expert assessment in light of their business needs, which would be the best and then ultimately do a migration.

And then when leadership changes, they just switch it back. Which is silly, but, to be fair, I wouldn't say never, but it's very difficult and uncommon for them to introduce a smaller or newer player in this specific space because, a, they've already invested so much in the particular platform that they were using. B, a lot of it is like a change management as well. People don't want to get to learn a new system or platform, so there's kind of resistance there, et cetera.

So where I'm going with this, that's perhaps relevant for you all is to say that, as you are focusing, forget the commercial or promotional side, say, even if specifically within medical and regulatory and some other areas you focus, even though you may be playing within the U.S. market for a while, you still need to think of the global business requirements because every pharma company operates in that manner.

They have to always, especially when they're launching products. When they're first launched, and especially the functions that you're talking about, prelaunch, everything is done globally from a strategy standpoint. So even though once you're launched, then there's still quite a bit of document review and approval to go on within each function specific to each market. If someone is trying to get into this space with them to begin with as a new player, perhaps, you have to sort of solve for their larger puzzle from the start.

**Tegus Client**
That's a great point especially on the larger end of the market, global entities. And we do have functionality for handling global and regional differences.

**Former Associate Partner at ZS Associates**
So you don't need to be able to serve all global markets from the start. My advice would be to understand their requirements at least of the other major markets. So for example, you're launching, even U.S.-based pharma company when they're launching, you will want to be able to be pretty familiar with the requirements of U.S., the EU5 countries. Honestly, if we would have had this call a couple of years ago, everyone, including myself, would have said that you have to include China, but increasingly, China is really trying to do their own thing in this industry to be perfectly honest.

So it's actually quite hard for U.S.-based companies to serve the China market and then at least perhaps like Brazil and Canada. That's kind of what I would advise. And then as a double click, what I mean as understand their requirements. For example, yes, at some point, you would need to be able to have translations for all the languages.

What I'm referring to are things like within regulatory, for example, the regulatory documents themselves, the filings and submissions by each country. Of course, they have different requirements from a process standpoint in terms of within the company who needs to have signed off on and what needs to be included, et cetera. So you'll want to be aware of that for those major markets because that would ultimately make the platform such that it could accommodate that in the future.

**Tegus Client**
Is it really the ability to be configured to whatever those unique regulatory needs are by geography? Or do you think it's just out of the box and set up that way? I mean take a step back here, it's building on a low-code automation platform. So it's automating processes to unique SOPs. So I guess is it just like making sure that the solutions can be configured to those regulatory requirements and however those processes need to be run by different geographies?

**Former Associate Partner at ZS Associates**
Yes, that's exactly it. And that's actually a very simple way to approach it, I mean you have to legally have SOPs for all these processes. So you need to ideally have them and read them, right, or understand the basics because, by the way, also from company to company, they really don't differ that much, of course. So as long as you understand those and then, yes, as long as your platform can be configured enough and really, once you've seen a couple of these SOPs from a couple of the major pharma companies, like I said, they're really not that different.

So where the configuration is going to come in is in things like, of course, the language, but the firewalls for certain individuals, like, for example, in the U.S., regulatory affairs, like the actual submissions and communications and sharing of documents with the FDA is, of course, handled by regulatory affairs in the U.S. and for U.S. countries.

But ex-U.S., a lot of companies have like for the markets that have an HTA, they will have an HTA center of excellence team that sits within global value and access, which is really more of a market access function and this might be getting a little too detailed, but it will change a little bit.

Each company sometimes they'll have them sit in market access, sometimes they sit in government affairs, et cetera. So it's just little nuances like those, but though in HTA country, they are the ones who actually do the preparation, review and run the approvals of the documents and then each company who actually submits it, they designate someone but it's not always regulatory.

**Tegus Client**
Veeva, obviously, a huge market share, larger end of the market. Interestingly enough, I've heard they are never going up against them for publication management? I guess could you talk about the strengths and weaknesses of Veeva? And just like what they do really well and like where they're not so good and why somebody might choose not to work with them?

**Former Associate Partner at ZS Associates**
I mean, you direct me but even in hearing your question and never thought occurred to me as well that might be helpful, which is that specifically within patient management, part of what set Veeva, as an example, aside for example, from a competition standpoint, there were also quite a number of companies who are managing their publications internally, like without an external platform provider at all still.

And then there are several management consulting firms and tech providers, ZS is one of them, will custom build and it's a hybrid. Sometimes they'll custom build something for them which we did at ZS for several clients or they will also do like a managed services relationship. So that happens quite a bit, actually.

**Tegus Client**
Let's get into the specific competitors for publication. Just across the board? What do you think like Veeva is good at and what you think their weakness is? They don't seem competitive in publications. But if you have any insight there, that would be great, too.

**Former Associate Partner at ZS Associates**
So the #1 downside with Veeva and some of the other similar platforms is that is really not about the platform itself, actually. It's that from a risk selling standpoint, two things. One, the laws are structured such that if you can very clearly show that medical and commercial, all things medical and all things commercial are separate from one another, in all the areas where they need to be.

That's the best way to defend against any accusations that could lead to a corporate integrity agreement for using not just publications, but really any of the activities that the medical function does, really as promotional, which probably is actually the #1 area where companies get sort of caught for corporate integrity agreements that then cost them hundreds of million dollars. So just to understand, I'm not sure how much you guys know about that.

But I'd bring that in, just to mention that really the magnitude of that decision making variable in this space is large. So in light of that, what you might have working in your favor actually is that because Veeva is so prevalent on the commercial and promotional side, most companies simply don't want to use the same platform because what's interesting is that most clients in this space, they really don't want to have to understand the controls and the intricacies of these systems, unless they are the IS or IT folks, right?

The business side is a, not interested or b, doesn't advertise because they have a different jobs. So it's much easier, a lot of this really actually boils down to a change management and human behavior things because it's much easier for them to just say, look, the systems are entirely different. So the system that we're using or the platform that we're using for all of our publication activities, sits within medical, is run by medical, is owned by medical and therefore, we don't even have any risk from a lack of appropriate firewalls, sampling, et cetera.

**Tegus Client**
So you think it's really that companies are looking at iEnvision, Anju, ICON or BP Logix precisely because they already have Veeva for like their commercial side, they want a distinct system for medical.

**Former Associate Partner at ZS Associates**
Yes. I know that that's it. That's the thing is because of my compliance background I can tell you, I mean, as a management consultant with the senior executives at these companies, say that they are pitching a platform to a company for and trying to pitch them on services, both for medical affairs and potentially also for regulatory and then we can talk about some other areas too, but decidedly not commercial, right.

IT and IS will be one of the buyers and decision makers for you all in that scenario. But really, they need to get signed off on even just the adoption of the platform itself from legal, regulatory, obviously, IT, IS and then in this scenario medical as well. And so whenever you're getting a legal sign-off in pharma, they're not just signing off on the contract terms, the way we think of legal and lots of other studies. It also means legal and compliance.

So they're specifically looking at from a risk standpoint and risk tolerance standpoint to just have everything we need, and is this from an enterprise life standpoint, a wise choice for us in light of what we're using elsewhere, et cetera. And so that's a long way of saying, yes, I absolutely know that that's driving decision making.

And in fact, I'm broadened many times as an adviser on that decision making. And then the second point I would say is that one of the things if you're trying to think about like how to differentiate in these spaces.

I know you're also asking questions specific technical input as well, which we can get back to. But what I do want to be very clear and honest with you all on is that that's not really what has the most weight in the decision making. I mean it's like table stakes, of course, to have the right functionality. But I have no doubt that it's not really that hard. Like you all can and do have the ability, I'm sure, to meet the functional requirements and technical requirements.

But one of the ways that you could differentiate, what's a better way to say is like you know all the counter voice to all of the hype around Generative AI right now is people voicing the concern about trust and security, and there's a whole lot more to it.

But thematically, there's kind of that counter voice arising, right, that everyone's like wait. But before we just hand over this mess, it's there. Because I can also tell you firsthand that there are many unfortunately providers, including management consulting firms and other vendors that aren't actually providing the level of not just data security and privacy.

What I'm trying to say is, tied to my earlier point that, it's really a big part of what those voices are trying to provide balance to us all on Generative AI, which is that nontechnical folks and business users are not able to stay as educated and informed of the complexity of what the technology available to us now entails and the power and value come along with it.

Because again, it's not everyone's job and it's immense. And so if what is already happening, because I've seen it happening, is that inevitably, when the decision makers who are ultimately making these decisions, which, again, are not actually the IS and IT folks. They are there. They are part of it, but they're not the only ones. When they have to make the decisions on who they partner with, from a vendor standpoint, invariably, part of that decision is involving a leap of faith built on existing trust with these players from working with them in other regards.

And it's not always deserved. I've seen it happen. And so while you all might be a newer player to some of them, one of my suggestions would be, if you can really focus on that pain point of how do we both, a, really come through as a trusted provider for them; and b, how do we make our technology and platform so like approachable to a layman that they feel confident. They both kind of buy in on the trust point. And they also feel confident because they understand it. That should go a long way.

And that's kind of what I would recommend because the players that are perhaps not as worthy of the opportunities that they're getting to play in these spaces, they are kind of being filtered out, but it's slow and it takes time.

The one other thing I'll just add is that, keep in mind, so functionally, and I do think it's wise that you all are thinking about, say, within medical, within regulatory. I would also say functionally in another area that you could look at for a promise for you all would be market access and value in access. I don't know how verse you all are yet on what a market access is considered commercial versus what is it? Because it's a grey answer, but it's not purely commercial.

And so for example, engaging with payers in the U.S. is commercial, but engaging with payers, ex-U.S. is not. And so that's, again, another reason why I say even though you're focusing on market and U.S. companies, it is opportunity for you in ex-U.S. could access global value and access. And then second point is that your clients are already factoring in and thinking about their business strategically with all those markets in mind so they kind of happy.

But what I was going to say is that medical clients, when you are pitching to medical clients, they are doctors, a lot of them. Not all of them, and functionally, they are really not that interested in the technical and operational pieces of things. They're interested in the science and all things that actually help to put the medical value of their therapies out there in a way that supports them. And regulatory clients, for example, also not interested in the technical pieces.

What they are interested in is you can think of them most similarly to lawyers, really. They're interested in making sure that they are following the legal requirements that they have to and everything they do is about risk benefit and risk assessment and risk tolerance. So they want as much, I'm sure you guys are familiar with the way doctors, who are engaging the patients on a regular basis, their complaints about EMR systems are along the same vein.

They are like I don't want to spend, if they could not do it, they would prefer that similar thing. So regulatory folks, especially, because functionally, they share these review processes. It's only they are the ones accountable. They need as much head space to be focused on the subject matter and the decision making itself and not the technical pieces.

**Tegus Client**
Could you ballpark pricing, so if you went and you contracted with like ZS to custom build your publication process, like could you ballpark pricing for building that app managed services like ARR? Like what are you looking at as a life sciences organization if you're having them build that for your publication system?

**Former Associate Partner at ZS Associates**
So of course, there is a spectrum. I'll try to give as helpful answer in light of that as I can. So for the build itself, a good ballpark is that most companies would not spend over $1 million, something more in the $500,000 range for the build, when I say the build, it should be inclusive of build, the testing, really getting it all the way to the point of being ready for their end users and then should also include some like training component sort of, for their users. That's a good rough estimate there.

One thing that you should also keep in mind is that, again, some of these established players is actually the ones that are willing to do a custom build. Just think of it as like you're going up against folks with deep pockets in some places. So they're willing to make to discount heavily as an investment because they see the long tail of the business because once they actually do the build, then they also will attend to be part of the managed services provider, obviously when revenues are good.

They're not going sacrifice a piece of it, having both the visibility that, that type of project gets them into operations and strategy is valuable to them and then access to the data itself is also very valuable to them. So even though I would say that the $500,000 is a realistic estimate and would actually provide some healthy margins for you all, you might compete against or to cut that almost in half just to get in the door and have that hold.

**Tegus Client**
So it's like $500,000 might be a good ballpark upfront to build a system like this. What kind of ARR would you see like the VS charging for the ongoing maintenance and like license of the system?

**Former Associate Partner at ZS Associates**
So if thinking purely licensing and maintenance, honestly. But most of the time, honestly, as I'm thinking about this, most of the time, the managed services model is adopted. So that wouldn't be a useful data point for you all, if you're not going at model. I would say it's probably about $100,000 to $150,000 is reasonable.

**Tegus Client**
And that seems to line up with like what the iEnvision or PubSTRAT or like a provider would be charging for ARR in your experience?

**Former Associate Partner at ZS Associates**
Yes. But again, I would just caution, keep in mind that if you're not going to be trying to be the managed services player, you might want to make sure that in your contracting terms, you protect yourselves from whoever is the third-party managed service type, I mean this happens all the time where the companies will hire us almost as like staff augmentation.

And that's like what you call managed services versus staff augmentation is, sometimes a thin line because it may not matter if the point of why you're even thinking about it is to make sure that whoever has access to your technology, is doing right by you all as well.

**Tegus Client**
Do you think that argument of the firewall with commercial is going to work with like R&D as well or less so?

**Former Associate Partner at ZS Associates**
It's less of an issue, because if you're already on the medical side, there's less of a need for a firewall between medical and the earlier development phases.

**Tegus Client**
I meant R&D and commercial, like so can we make this argument for hey, R&D come with us because you already have Veeva for commercial or is that not going to play?

**Former Associate Partner at ZS Associates**
Yes. That would work, and from a document review and approval processing standpoint in R&D, there are two things, of course, before the drugs on market, everything held much, much closer to best, right? So when, for example, there is value in the R&D space for you all.

But it's also going to be higher barrier to entrance because they are overall with very good reason, even more protective of who outside of the company is, even within the company, has access to anything going on prelaunch because one of the many obvious reasons is that they can get into a lot of trouble. I mean the stakes are very high. So yes, it would work, but in general you'll still sort of need a really thoughtful strategy for the R&D space.

**Tegus Client**
Looking within R&D, if they were to expand in that direction, what are the processes that you think like we have a document and they need to go through review and approval, where we might have the most opportunity?

**Former Associate Partner at ZS Associates**
So within market access especially global, like we were talking about engagement with payers and regulators about the economics, value of the drug or therapy is a huge space. There's lots of opportunity for you there because most of the engagement with these payers and regulators ex-U.S. are all of the information about the safety and efficacy is handled through regulatory affairs in the existing channels, but then there is engagement with the payers and global regulators about the health economics and budgetary impact of the therapy. So preapproval.

**Tegus Client**
Is it like the documentation you're putting together to be reviewed or is it actual like interactions themselves?

**Former Associate Partner at ZS Associates**
I mean both. So as an example, if you're launching a new diabetes therapy, or let's say, migraine therapy, before it's even launched, as a company, you'll build out a lot of economic models. You'll conduct some studies, you'll publish on those studies, you'll partner with some other third party to get different analysis done to show. Again, this has nothing to do with the drug itself.

You're trying to show that the economic burden meeting the cost of servicing the migraine patients in a given population or country is X amount. You're basically trying to show it's super costly as it is. And all of the documentation is that you'll show to payers and regulators will include all of it. They want to look at the models, they want to look to the analysis, the papers, all of it.

Then once your drug is approved, then you also show them, look, “Here's all those same types of documents, models, et cetera, showing that when our drug is used, it actually overall lowers the cost of care for all of these migraine patients in this way." So that's kind of a very quick way of explaining like if you guys spend a little time honestly just googling a bit on Health Economics and Outcomes Research, that's a big space.

**Tegus Client**
And just getting all that stuff like reviewed and approved by the right people before you actually submit it to those external?

**Former Associate Partner at ZS Associates**
Yes. What's also interesting and this is a stage where you could do something innovative is that really what those regulators and payers are looking for. And this is also true of U.S. payers, by the way, is that data, those models, those studies, et cetera. Nobody trusts it from the drug companies. Let's call it like it is. So there's always room for improvement on proving the integrity of those analyses, models, et cetera.

And so historically, it's always been, well, we only trust it if it's from on unbiased third parties, right, which there's a lot of times there's partnership, but there's also lots of improvement of way to show, look, here's how we can prove out that this is legitimate and valid.

**Tegus Client**
I see the kind of rhyming between that there is process leads and like publications and other processes, it's really at its core like he is the right people to review, approve and then you get sent out to those people?

**Former Associate Partner at ZS Associates**
Yes. And also, honestly, a quick bit of advice is like to the extent that you can see and get smart you could just try to get smart on understanding the SOPs and processes themselves. I mean, you can probe specifically on what is your standard operating procedure for XYZ. And because, again, I'm confident your gap is probably just in being aware of what those processes are. And then once you're aware of them, you can build to it, no problem. So that's kind of what I would advise you as for some of the R&D space.

An R&D is actually, of course, is much more nuanced. And there are multiple functions within it. So that's kind of what I would suggest because then you can kind of skip ahead, leapfrog in your understanding once you understand the SOPs quite a bit.

**Tegus Client**
Awesome. Thank you so much for chatting. Really appreciate it. Have a good one.
