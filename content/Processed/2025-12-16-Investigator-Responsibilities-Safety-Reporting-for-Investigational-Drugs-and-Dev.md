## Summary
The FDA is providing new guidance to clarify safety reporting requirements for clinical investigators conducting studies of investigational drugs and devices. This guidance aims to standardize how researchers identify and communicate safety information during clinical trials.

## Startup Angle
A compliance and safety reporting software startup could benefit by creating a specialized platform that helps researchers automatically track, document, and report adverse events and safety signals for clinical trials. Companies like DataTrial, Safety360, or CliniSafe could develop AI-powered tools that streamline the complex safety reporting process outlined in this FDA guidance, reducing manual work and ensuring regulatory compliance for research institutions and pharmaceutical companies.
