### Background & Problem

- Previously at Carbon Health as product leader for care delivery tools
- Built provider/nurse tools and homegrown EHR at Carbon Health with co-founder Matt
- Three key market shifts identified:
	- AI agents showing proven results
	- Clinical workforce shortage (⅓ of nurses leaving in next 2 years per Accenture)
	- Value-based care becoming standard (50% Medicare, 40% commercial contracts)

### Product & Technology

- Focus on clinical conversations vs administrative tasks
- Post-discharge monitoring for mid-sized hospitals
- Key features:
	- No EMR integration required - operates from CSV file with discharge data
	- Customizable clinical protocols per hospital
	- Voice AI agents conduct patient follow-up within 24-48 hours
- Example use case: Congestive Heart Failure post-discharge monitoring
	- Tracks medication adherence, symptoms, daily activities
	- Early intervention potential ($15k cost per readmission)

### AI Performance Metrics

- AI agent boosted enrollment by 10%
- Patients engaged in deeper health discussions with AI
- Extended conversation times (up to 37 minutes)
- High NPS scores from patients
- AI showed better protocol adherence than humans

### Fundraising & Goals

- Raising $2M pre-seed at $12M cap
- 18-24 month runway target
- Key milestones for next round:
	- Clinical efficacy validation through pilots
	- Pricing structure validation ($80/patient vs $5k per avoided readmission)
	- Channel and use case optimization
- Currently in late-stage discussions with other investors

### Next Steps

- Levent to update on term sheet status
- Virtue team to review internally and respond with next steps
