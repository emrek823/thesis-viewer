## Key Feedback

### 1. What is SMB? The positioning has sharpened but the one-liner is still muddy.

The manifesto is excellent — "multimodal foundation model that creates universal patient representations." But when Kevin talks to pharma, is the pitch "we predict clinical trajectories better than LLMs" or "we're the infrastructure layer for biomedical AI"? The Sanofi engagement started with enrollment prediction. The IQVIA proposal is for compute services. The academic positioning is "state-of-the-art cancer prognosis." These are three different companies. Before Series A, nail the crisp positioning.

### 2. Commercial traction is real but concentrated. Sanofi is everything.

$360K POC signed. $4.8M contract expected Mar/Apr 2026. But if Sanofi slips, there's no backup — runway is 10.9 months. The IQVIA $44M proposal is massive but unclear on timeline. Tempus is "seeking SMB as partner" which validates the thesis but hasn't converted to revenue. The bear case is Sanofi delays, Series A stalls, and 10.9 months isn't enough. What's the contingency plan?

### 3. AMC partnerships are the moat — but are they exclusive?

MSK, MD Anderson, Yale, UCSD, Mount Sinai, Mayo (in-person visit requested). This is the data acquisition strategy. But the diligence question remains: Can MSK also work with Tempus, Bioptimus, or Google? Who owns the trained model weights? What's the renewal structure? If these partnerships are non-exclusive and competitors can replicate, the moat is thinner than it appears.

### 4. Epic Curiosity is the elephant in the room.

100B patient events. 90%+ US hospital distribution. "Plausible future timelines" — same world model concept. Outperformed 78 single-purpose models. Researcher access opens Feb 2026. The thesis is SMB targets pharma R&D while Epic targets hospital ops — different buyers, different data governance. But what if Epic decides to serve pharma? What if OpenAI partners with Epic? This is the critical risk that needs a clear response in investor conversations.

### 5. The JEPA architecture is validated but the lift is task-specific.

+5.8% AUROC on dynamic tasks at MSK. Treatment change prediction: 0.78 vs 0.70. The hierarchy is clear: generalist < specialist < world model. But on static classification, LLMs are competitive. What percentage of pharma use cases are dynamic vs. static? The MSK validation is excellent — but has it been replicated at MD Anderson, Yale, or UCSD?

### 6. Team velocity is exceptional — can it scale?

Irsyad: PhD thesis + ICLR paper in first month. Zekai: ACL paper in one week. 3 ICLR 2026 acceptances. Model weights public on HuggingFace. This is founder-grade talent density. But at 8 people, can they close Sanofi, support 6+ AMC partnerships, AND run a Series A? The hiring plan mentions bringing in senior commercial leadership — what's the timeline?

### 7. The data acquisition flywheel is the right strategy. What's the 2026 plan?

The 1M oncology CTs from Gradient for $150K was smart. The Nash Bio partnership could unlock Vanderbilt multimodal data. But what's the systematic data acquisition budget for post-Series A? At what point does SMB have "plurality" of data where not working with you limits performance?

### 8. Series A mechanics: What's the pitch and who's leading?

JPM meetings scheduled with Lux, GV, North Pond, Pioneer. Target $30M raise. The deck presumably leads with Sanofi traction + MSK validation + JEPA differentiation. But the question VCs will ask: "Why won't Epic or OpenAI just do this?" Have you stress-tested the pitch against that objection?

## Open Questions

**On Commercial Execution:**
1. Sanofi $4.8M targeted Mar/Apr 2026. What are the specific gating factors?
2. IQVIA $44M — Who's the internal champion? Decision timeline?
3. Tempus "seeking SMB as partner" — validation or competitive positioning?

**On Epic Competition:**
4. Epic Curiosity opens Feb 2026. What's your plan when they publish benchmarks?
5. Have pharma prospects mentioned Epic as consideration?
6. Can pharma access Epic's 100B events for proprietary R&D?

**On AMC Strategy:**
7. Are any AMC partnerships exclusive?
8. Who owns trained model weights on AMC data?
9. If Epic/OpenAI approaches MSK with more money, what's the defense?

**On Series A:**
10. Target raise and valuation? Who's leading?
11. 10.9 months runway — backup plan if Series A slips?
12. JPM pitch — "we beat LLMs" or "we have pharma deals"?

## What We Can Help With

**Health System Intros:**
- Mayo (Vera Mucaj intro made Dec 2025)
- Kaiser — potentially massive data partnership

**Investor Intros:**
- Bessemer (Marla Jalbut intro made Dec 2025)
- 8VC (Susan Liu intro made Dec 2025)

**Competitive Intelligence:**
- We track Epic closely via thesis work
- Ongoing updates on Curiosity researcher results (Feb 2026)

## Bottom Line

**What's working:** Technical validation (JEPA +5.8% at MSK), commercial traction (Sanofi closing), AMC data flywheel (6+ partnerships), team velocity (3 ICLR papers)

**What needs sharpening:** One-liner positioning, Epic response, AMC exclusivity clarity, Series A runway risk

**Bull case:** Sanofi closes, IQVIA follows, JEPA edge holds vs Epic, AMC data plurality creates winner-take-all. $1B+ outcome.

**Bear case:** Sanofi slips, Epic matches JEPA, OpenAI partners with Tempus/Epic, AMC partnerships non-exclusive. $50-100M exit.
