Hi! I am Kexin. I am a PhD student at Stanford Computer Science, advised by Prof. [Jure Leskovec](https://cs.stanford.edu/~jure/) and affiliated with Stanford AI Lab. My research is supported by [Stanford Bio-X fellowship](https://biox.stanford.edu/research/phd-fellows).

I work on enabling AI to produce novel, deployable, and interpretable biomedical and therapeutic discoveries. Questions that I am excited about:

* How to model across massive, diverse, multi-modal, and multi-scale biological experiments to generate novel hypotheses and discoveries?
* How to make these discoveries reliable, trustworthy, and overall aligned with what scientists truly value?
* How to automate day-to-day biological tasks? What does it take to build a fully autonomous AI biologist?

I answer these questions on diverse and difficult biomedical problems throughout the therapeutics discovery and development pipeline. I also address core AI challenges raised by these problems - multi-modal modeling, agentic reasoning, uncertainty quantification, etc.

Previously, I worked with Prof. [Marinka Zitnik](https://zitniklab.hms.harvard.edu/), Dr. [Cao Xiao](https://sites.google.com/view/danicaxiao/home?authuser=0), Prof. [Jimeng Sun](http://sunlab.org/), and Prof. [Rajesh Ranganath](https://cims.nyu.edu/~rajeshr/). I have spent time researching at Genentech, GSK, Pfizer, IQVIA, Dana-Farber, Flatiron Health, and Rockefeller University. I did my undergrad at NYU in math & CS & studio art, and master at Harvard in health data science in the biostatistics department.
