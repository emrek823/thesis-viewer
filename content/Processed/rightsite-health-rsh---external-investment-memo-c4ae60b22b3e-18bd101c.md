**Executive Summary**

RSH contracts directly with payers as an in-network credentialed provider, builds relationships with local EMS agencies, and provides EMS professionals with on-demand telehealth access to ED physicians and non-clinical, empathetically-trained care navigators. The RSH Connect Platform reduces avoidable ED visits by providing patients with in-network, non-ED sites of care and 24-hour follow-up care.

ED visits and costs have been rising over the last decade - overwhelming EMS agencies, leading to overcrowding in hospitals, driving unnecessary costs for payers, and putting undue burden on patients with OOP costs. Recent trends, however, are bringing all stakeholders to a breaking point. With 74M avoidable ED visits in 2022 and average savings of ~$2,000, we estimate a ~$150B market

## Slide 3: Executive Summary (Cont.)

opportunity to reduce avoidable ED visits that is severely under-penetrated today. Current players have been focused on non-ambulance originated patients, failed to solve the network problem of many OON EMS agencies connecting with many payers, and struggled to address the SDOH root cause of many of these non-emergency visits. RSH directly addresses these gaps - capturing this population through the 911 episode, utilizing its deep understanding of EMS management incentives, and leveraging its payer relationships to link SDoH improvements to MLR improvement for payers.

RSH is the prototypical example of what we look for in venture-scalable care delivery models. It fits directly into the paramedics current workflow and requires no additional behavior change from patients laying the foundation for a scalable patient acquisition engine. It has a cleanly attributable and guaranteed value proposition for payers that drives high cost savings for a defined episode of care. Its focus on empowering its navigators and ED physicians with technology provides the opportunity for >50% care margins in a CapEx-light model.

The management team is uniquely positioned to execute on this particular model and early momentum with both payers and EMS agencies de-risks early operational considerations out of the gate. With this $6M raise, RSH can execute payer contracts with gainshare agreements, demonstrate operational scale in 2-3 communities, and build out the team and tech infrastructure. With its business model and GTM strategy, RSH can scale to $50M+ in top-line revenue with opportunities in 5 urban areas alone (1M total transports from EMS agencies resulting in 50K - 100K RSH interventions).

Virtue is leading a $6M seed financing at a $17.5M post-money valuation with a $900K check for 5.14% fully-diluted ownership.

**Management Team Overview**

The RSH management team has decades of experience building tech-enabled healthcare services businesses that drive clinical outcomes for patients and financial value for shareholders. The team's relationships expedite payer sales and conversations, and their understanding of clinical and non-clinical SDOH workflows and operations position them as a partner to EMS agencies. These two components unlock the opportunity to incentivize EMS agencies to divert patients to alternate sites of care, a key rate-limiting step that other teams in market have failed to accomplish at scale.

*   Jamo Rubin (Co-Founder/CEO) has founded and sold three different businesses in the healthcare space, most recently selling TAVHealth to Signify in March 2019. TAVHealth, a leading platform for collaborating with risk-bearing and community-based organizations to address SDoH, provided the foundation for Signify Health's community solution. The emphasis and focus on helping patients resolve SDoH, plays an important role in the RSH buildout, given that SDoH is often the root cause of an avoidable ED visit. In fact, many of the similar operational principles as well as various technology, managerial, and professionals from TAVHealth will be brought on in various RSH positions.

*   Matt Sedgwick (CFO) has decades of experience across corporate finance and tech-enabled services in healthcare, most recently as a SVP at Formation Capital.

To-date, the team has spent 12 months and invested >$1.5M of their own capital to prove out the need for the operating model. Their experience and vision to build a category-defining business gives us confidence they can attract the 3 C's - customers, community, and capital. We've seen from their conversations with payers to-date and response from EMS agencies that the team can sell to organizations around the country. They've already assembled a top-notch management team that has worked together previously, an experienced tech team that worked with Jamo at 2 previous companies, and are able to recruit previous navigators from TAV. Very few teams in market are able to successfully recruit top quality talent across all parts of the business this early in the company's trajectory, especially ones that have worked before on successful exits. In addition, the team's previous relationship with investors and interest we've seen from the downstream market give us confidence they can raise capital in any market cycle.

Disclosure: Jamo Rubin and Michael Boxer are currently LPs in Virtue's Fund I and Sean has had a relationship with both over the last 3+ years.

**Market Overview**

**ED Costs Increasing but ~50% of EMS Transports Avoidable:** The number of ED visits across the country has increased dramatically over the last decade - up 18% between 2009 (127.3M) and 2019 (150.7M). While there was a 45% decline in overall ED volume during COVID, volumes today are only down 4% compared to 2019. We estimate there will be ~145M total ED visits in the US in 2022. During this same time period, the total spending on ED visits across the country has increased 51% per capita. The average cost for an ED visit can range from ~$500-$600 to $3,400 (RSH ClosedLoop.ai Analysis based on 2019 NYC Medicare data), depending on the geography, payer, and patient characteristics. We will use $2,400 as a baseline for the cost of an avoidable ED admission, and discuss different assumptions in the "Business Model Breakdown" section.

## Slide 6: Market Overview (Cont.)

An avoidable ED visit has three outcomes - an ED discharge (~70% of visits), an inpatient admission (~20%), or an observation unit stay (~10%) Based on methodology using the industry-accepted NYU ED Classification Algorithm, RSH worked with ClosedLoop.ai to perform an actuarial analysis based on 2019 Medicare claims data to better understand the flow of patients through the ED (described below). The 16M avoidable ED visits that arrive by ambulance are RSH's initial target with their inbound service, but RSH can expand over time to address all avoidable ED visits.

**Chart: Total ED Visits (2022 Patient Flow - Virtue + RSH Assumptions)**

| Category                      | Total ED Visits |
| :---------------------------- | :-------------- |
| **Total ED Visits**           | 145 M           |
| **51% of Visits are Avoidable** | 74 M            |
| Arrive by Ambulance           | 16 M            |
| Walk-in                       | 58 M            |
| **49% of Visits are Non-avoidable** | 71 M            |
| Arrive by Ambulance           | 23 M            |
| Walk-in                       | 49 M            |

**EMS Overview:** In 2020, there were 42.5M EMS responses from 911 calls and 30.9M EMS transports (e.g., ~27% of calls don't result in a transport). There are roughly 20K EMS agencies across the country and ~1M licensed EMS professionals (emergency medical responder, emergency medical technician, paramedic, etc). For 911 response services, agencies utilize two types of ambulance unit crews: Advanced Life Support (ALS) units and Basic Life Support (BLS) units. ALS units, which are staffed by two paramedics or one paramedic and a lower level EMT, are equipped with high-acuity life support equipment such as cardiac monitors, defibrillators and oxygen delivery systems, and carry pharmaceutical and medical supplies. BLS units are generally staffed by two lower-level EMTs and are outfitted with medical supplies and equipment necessary to administer first aid and basic medical treatment. Across the country, 30% of EMS calls were serviced by fire departments, 25% were serviced by private companies, 12% were serviced by hospital-owned services, and the other 33% were serviced by community non-profits or governmental, non-fire agencies that only offer EMS.

**Why now?**

Unnecessary ED visits and rising costs have been a burden on the healthcare system for the last decade, but recent headwinds are pushing many stakeholders

to the brink. EMS agencies, hospitals, payers, and patients are in desperate need of a true partner.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  **# Thought Process for Extractor**

The user wants to extract information from the PDF and present it as well-structured markdown. This isn't just a simple text dump; it requires identifying headers, lists, tables, and even data from charts. The output should be formatted for a "VC research knowledge base," implying clarity and ease of access to specific data points.

Here's a breakdown of my thought process for each section:

1.  **Understand the Goal:** The primary goal is *structured data extraction* for a VC knowledge base. This means:
    *   **Accuracy:** Transcribe text exactly.
    *   **Structure:** Use markdown headers, lists, and especially *tables* for tabular data and chart data.
    *   **Completeness:** Get *all* text, including fine print, URLs, and data points from charts/tables.
    *   **No Interpretation:** Strictly extract, don't summarize or add commentary.

2.  **Initial Scan and Strategy:**
    *   **Page 1:** Title, sections list, Deal Overview, Diligence. Looks like standard text and bullet points.
    *   **Page 2:** Company Essentials (bullets), Deal Terms (bullets), Executive Summary (paragraphs). Straightforward.
    *   **Page 3:** More Executive Summary, Virtue's investment, Team section header. Standard text.
    *   **Page 4:** Team details with photos and logos. Need to extract names, titles, and affiliations/past companies. Logos are mentioned, but I can't "extract" image content, only text. I'll note the logos listed. Paragraphs about team.
    *   **Page 5:** More Team, Market Overview, ED Cost data. The ED cost data has ranges and specific numbers (e.g., 127.3M, 150.7M).
    *   **Page 6:** Market Overview continues, "Total ED Visits" chart. **Crucial: This is a table, not just text.** I need to capture the exact numbers and categories. EMS Overview (paragraphs), Why now?
    *   **Page 7:** "Recent Market Headwinds" table. **Crucial: Extract this as a markdown table.** Market Opportunity section.
    *   **Page 8:** Market Opportunity formulas (TAM, SAM, SOM) and three tables. **Crucial: Convert these three tables to markdown tables.** Competitive landscape.
    *   **Page 9:** Competitive landscape continues with bullet points and mentions of companies and their valuations/funding.
    *   **Page 10:** References to PDF decks (I can't access them, but I'll list the filenames). Clinical / Product section, CMS' ET3 Model, RSH Inbound Model (with bullet points).
    *   **Page 11:** RSH Inbound Model continues (bullet points), then a visual "How RightSite Works" flowchart. **Crucial: I need to describe the steps in the flowchart clearly as a numbered list or bullet points.** I'll also note the "RightSite Health, LLC" and "RSH Inbound Model 2022" text.
    *   **Page 12:** Atlanta Pilot Data (paragraphs), "RightSite Patient Disposition" pie chart, "RightSite Patient Insurance" bar chart, "70% RightSite Success" table, "30% ED Outcomes" table. **Crucial: Extract data from all these charts/tables.** RSH Outbound Model (paragraph), Tech Platform (paragraph).
    *   **Page 13:** "RSH Product Roadmap 2022 - 2023" gantt-like chart. **Crucial: I need to convert this into a structured list of features/modules by quarter, noting their status.** Business Model Breakdown, "Value proposition" table. **Crucial: Convert this table.**
    *   **Page 14:** Value proposition table continues. Business Model, bullet points (Efficient patient acquisition, High $ / defined episode, 50+% care margins).
    *   **Page 15:** Efficient patient acquisition continues, "Annual EMS Transports" flowchart. **Crucial: Describe the flow and extract the numbers/percentages into a structured format (likely a table or detailed bullet points).**
    *   **Page 16:** "$ / Episode" section, "Payer Perspective for Individual Patient Diverted: Before and After RSH" table. **Crucial: Extract this table.** ">50% Care Margins" (paragraph), GTM (paragraph).
    *   **Page 17:** GTM continues, Payer Contracting Strategy, bullet points (Clean attribution, No additional work, Guarantee). Wholesale/Retail strategy.
    *   **Page 18:** GTM continues, EMS Strategy, Current status table. **Crucial: Extract this table.**
    *   **Page 19:** Current status table continues. Financials, Key Assumptions and Scenarios, bullet points.
    *   **Page 20:** Financials continue, bullet points (25% Gainshare, Reduced "Care Efficiency"). Paragraph about revenue.
    *   **Page 21:** "Per Episode Analysis: RSH vs. Payer" stacked bar chart, and two tables. **Crucial: Extract all data from the chart and tables.** Key Milestones.
    *   **Page 22:** Key Milestones (bullet points), Opportunities / Risks, Opportunities (bullet point).
    *   **Page 23:** Opportunities (bullet points), Risks (+ mitigation strategies) (bullet points).
    *   **Page 24:** Risks (+ mitigation strategies) (bullet point).

3.  **Execution - Detailed Steps & Self-Correction:**

    *   **Headers:** Use `#` for document title, `##` for major sections (slides), `###` for sub-sections.
    *   **Lists:** Standard markdown `*` for unordered, `1.` for ordered.
    *   **Tables:**
        *   Identify header row.
        *   Identify data rows.
        *   Use `|` for columns and `---` for header separator.
        *   Ensure all units (M, $, %) are preserved.
        *   *Self-correction:* For complex tables or tables with merged cells (like the "Total ED Visits" on page 6), I need to represent the overarching categories as primary rows and then sub-categories as indented rows or clearly delineated in the value column. For the sake of a markdown table, sometimes breaking it into simpler, related tables or using a key/value pair list for complexity is better than trying to force merged cells into markdown. In this case, the Total ED Visits can be cleanly represented as a table with sub-categories.
    *   **Charts/Graphs:** This is the most challenging.
        *   **Pie Chart (Page 12 - Patient Disposition):** List segments and their percentages.
            *   RightSite Navigation: 70%
            *   To ED: 30%
        *   **Bar Chart (Page 12 - Patient Insurance):** List each bar's label and its value. I'll estimate values if not explicitly written on the bars, but typically they are implied by the chart's scale. *Correction:* The bar chart on page 12 has an unlabeled Y-axis and precise values aren't given, only relative heights. I'll list the payers in descending order of height as implied, acknowledging the lack of precise numerical values from the image itself. I'll describe it as "Relative frequency."
        *   **Flowcharts (Page 11, 15):** Describe the steps sequentially using bullet points or a numbered list. For Page 15 (EMS Transports), the percentages are critical and form a branching structure. I'll represent it as a top-level item with branches as sub-bullets, capturing the percentages and outcomes.
        *   **Stacked Bar Chart (Page 21 - Per Episode Analysis):** Identify the x-axis (scenarios: Original, $1,200 ED, 25% Gainshare, Inc. Care Inputs) and the stacked components (Payer Savings, Patient Care Costs, RSH Margin). Then list the total revenue for Y1 and Y2 separately. This will become a multi-row, multi-column table.
    *   **URLs/References:** Keep them as is.
    *   **Fine Print/Footnotes:** Include them.
    *   **Logos:** Mention that logos are present and list any accompanying text.
    *   **Image descriptions:** For elements that are purely visual (like a flowchart that can't be represented as a table), I'll provide a concise textual description of its flow or components.

4.  **Review and Refine:**
    *   Read through the generated markdown.
    *   Compare against the original PDF page by page.
    *   Check for any missed text, incorrect formatting, or data errors.
    *   Ensure all numbers and units are correct.
    *   Verify markdown syntax for headers, lists, and tables.
    *   Make sure there's no added commentary.
    *   Check that chart data extraction is as accurate and complete as possible given the visual information.

This structured approach helps ensure a comprehensive and accurate extraction, fulfilling all the user's requirements for a VC research knowledge base.# RightSite Health (RSH) - External Investment Memo

**Executive Summary**

RSH contracts directly with payers as an in-network credentialed provider, builds relationships with local EMS agencies, and provides EMS professionals with on-demand telehealth access to ED physicians and non-clinical, empathetically-trained care navigators. The RSH Connect Platform reduces avoidable ED visits by providing patients with in-network, non-ED sites of care and 24-hour follow-up care.

ED visits and costs have been rising over the last decade - overwhelming EMS agencies, leading to overcrowding in hospitals, driving unnecessary costs for payers, and putting undue burden on patients with OOP costs. Recent trends, however, are bringing all stakeholders to a breaking point. With 74M avoidable ED visits in 2022 and average savings of ~$2,000, we estimate a ~$150B market

## Slide 3: Executive Summary (Cont.)

opportunity to reduce avoidable ED visits that is severely under-penetrated today. Current players have been focused on non-ambulance originated patients, failed to solve the network problem of many OON EMS agencies connecting with many payers, and struggled to address the SDOH root cause of many of these non-emergency visits. RSH directly addresses these gaps - capturing this population through the 911 episode, utilizing its deep understanding of EMS management incentives, and leveraging its payer relationships to link SDoH improvements to MLR improvement for payers.

RSH is the prototypical example of what we look for in venture-scalable care delivery models. It fits directly into the paramedics current workflow and requires no additional behavior change from patients laying the foundation for a scalable patient acquisition engine. It has a cleanly attributable and guaranteed value proposition for payers that drives high cost savings for a defined episode of care. Its focus on empowering its navigators and ED physicians with technology provides the opportunity for >50% care margins in a CapEx-light model.

The management team is uniquely positioned to execute on this particular model and early momentum with both payers and EMS agencies de-risks early operational considerations out of the gate. With this $6M raise, RSH can execute payer contracts with gainshare agreements, demonstrate operational scale in 2-3 communities, and build out the team and tech infrastructure. With its business model and GTM strategy, RSH can scale to $50M+ in top-line revenue with opportunities in 5 urban areas alone (1M total transports from EMS agencies resulting in 50K - 100K RSH interventions).

Virtue is leading a $6M seed financing at a $17.5M post-money valuation with a $900K check for 5.14% fully-diluted ownership.

**Management Team Overview**

The RSH management team has decades of experience building tech-enabled healthcare services businesses that drive clinical outcomes for patients and financial value for shareholders. The team's relationships expedite payer sales and conversations, and their understanding of clinical and non-clinical SDOH workflows and operations position them as a partner to EMS agencies. These two components unlock the opportunity to incentivize EMS agencies to divert patients to alternate sites of care, a key rate-limiting step that other teams in market have failed to accomplish at scale.

*   Jamo Rubin (Co-Founder/CEO) has founded and sold three different businesses in the healthcare space, most recently selling TAVHealth to Signify in March 2019. TAVHealth, a leading platform for collaborating with risk-bearing and community-based organizations to address SDoH, provided the foundation for Signify Health's community solution. The emphasis and focus on helping patients resolve SDoH, plays an important role in the RSH buildout, given that SDoH is often the root cause of an avoidable ED visit. In fact, many of the similar operational principles as well as various technology, managerial, and professionals from TAVHealth will be brought on in various RSH positions.

*   Matt Sedgwick (CFO) has decades of experience across corporate finance and tech-enabled services in healthcare, most recently as a SVP at Formation Capital.

To-date, the team has spent 12 months and invested >$1.5M of their own capital to prove out the need for the operating model. Their experience and vision to build a category-defining business gives us confidence they can attract the 3 C's - customers, community, and capital. We've seen from their conversations with payers to-date and response from EMS agencies that the team can sell to organizations around the country. They've already assembled a top-notch management team that has worked together previously, an experienced tech team that worked with Jamo at 2 previous companies, and are able to recruit previous navigators from TAV. Very few teams in market are able to successfully recruit top quality talent across all parts of the business this early in the company's trajectory, especially ones that have worked before on successful exits. In addition, the team's previous relationship with investors and interest we've seen from the downstream market give us confidence they can raise capital in any market cycle.

Disclosure: Jamo Rubin and Michael Boxer are currently LPs in Virtue's Fund I and Sean has had a relationship with both over the last 3+ years.

**Market Overview**

**ED Costs Increasing but ~50% of EMS Transports Avoidable:** The number of ED visits across the country has increased dramatically over the last decade - up 18% between 2009 (127.3M) and 2019 (150.7M). While there was a 45% decline in overall ED volume during COVID, volumes today are only down 4% compared to 2019. We estimate there will be ~145M total ED visits in the US in 2022. During this same time period, the total spending on ED visits across the country has increased 51% per capita. The average cost for an ED visit can range from ~$500-$600 to $3,400 (RSH ClosedLoop.ai Analysis based on 2019 NYC Medicare data), depending on the geography, payer, and patient characteristics. We will use $2,400 as a baseline for the cost of an avoidable ED admission, and discuss different assumptions in the "Business Model Breakdown" section.

## Slide 6: Market Overview (Cont.)

An avoidable ED visit has three outcomes - an ED discharge (~70% of visits), an inpatient admission (~20%), or an observation unit stay (~10%) Based on methodology using the industry-accepted NYU ED Classification Algorithm, RSH worked with ClosedLoop.ai to perform an actuarial analysis based on 2019 Medicare claims data to better understand the flow of patients through the ED (described below). The 16M avoidable ED visits that arrive by ambulance are RSH's initial target with their inbound service, but RSH can expand over time to address all avoidable ED visits.

**Chart: Total ED Visits (2022 Patient Flow - Virtue + RSH Assumptions)**

| Category                      | Value (M) |
| :---------------------------- | :-------- |
| Total ED Visits               | 145       |
| **51% of Visits are Avoidable** | **74**    |
| Arrive by Ambulance           | 16        |
| Walk-in                       | 58        |
| **49% of Visits are Non-avoidable** | **71**    |
| Arrive by Ambulance           | 23        |
| Walk-in                       | 49        |

**EMS Overview:** In 2020, there were 42.5M EMS responses from 911 calls and 30.9M EMS transports (e.g., ~27% of calls don't result in a transport). There are roughly 20K EMS agencies across the country and ~1M licensed EMS professionals (emergency medical responder, emergency medical technician, paramedic, etc). For 911 response services, agencies utilize two types of ambulance unit crews: Advanced Life Support (ALS) units and Basic Life Support (BLS) units. ALS units, which are staffed by two paramedics or one paramedic and a lower level EMT, are equipped with high-acuity life support equipment such as cardiac monitors, defibrillators and oxygen delivery systems, and carry pharmaceutical and medical supplies. BLS units are generally staffed by two lower-level EMTs and are outfitted with medical supplies and equipment necessary to administer first aid and basic medical treatment. Across the country, 30% of EMS calls were serviced by fire departments, 25% were serviced by private companies, 12% were serviced by hospital-owned services, and the other 33% were serviced by community non-profits or governmental, non-fire agencies that only offer EMS.

**Why now?**

Unnecessary ED visits and rising costs have been a burden on the healthcare system for the last decade, but recent headwinds are pushing many stakeholders

*Virtue Market Opportunity Analysis (2022)*

**Competitive landscape:** We break the competitive landscape for RSH into 3 main buckets below.

**EMS/911 Tech and Service Partners (e.g., Tele911, MDAlly, EM Guide):**

*   MDAlly (founded in 2018, GC led $3.5M Seed in 2021): MDAlly utilizes extenders (RN or PA) so more patients with potentially avoidable visits end up in the ER compared to RSH's physician-led model. MDAlly also integrates with 911 emergency dispatch directly, forcing a change in workflow for 911 and EMS. The company is focused today on billing FFS telehealth codes with payers in Florida and Arizona, but have failed to execute on actually engaging EMS agencies and patients (2022E revenue is minimal or near $0).

## Slide 9: Competitive Landscape (Cont.)

*   EM Guide: EM Guide's founders are current Wharton students who have bootstrapped the business to-date and have a similar clinical model to RSH, but lack navigators to address SDoH issues. The company is also struggling to secure payer contracts and has a smaller financial incentive for EMS ($50 for EM Guide vs. ~$400 for RSH).
*   Tele 911 (founded in 2020, $2.9M raised): Tele911 integrates with 911 software and provides paramedics access to an emergency physician for telemedicine on the spot and patient support for follow up. Tele911 physicians can dispatch the patient to remain at home or navigate them to an in-network ED or alternative destination such as an in-network urgent care.

**Companies with Transport Capabilities (Nobis, DocGo, AMR):**

*   Nobis, which was founded in 2021 by experienced healthcare operators, is the closest competitor to RSH in this bucket. Nobis has a similar payer contracting strategy and value prop to EMS, but focuses on high-acuity patients (e.g., PACE, D-SNP), has asset-light emergency transportation capabilities, a stronger aftercare focus, and has a virtual consult/triage for response center intake and dispatch.
*   DocGo (EV =$649M, EV/2022E Revenue = 1.5x) and AMR (acquired by KKR for $2.4B in 2018). Theoretically, DocGo and AMR have the resources to engage in innovative payment structures similar to RSH, but according to industry references, both are focused on a playbook to improve operational scale and maximize FFS billing.

**In-home urgent care / primary care (Dispatch, Ready Responders, Heal, etc):**
Companies like Dispatch, Ready Responders, Heal and many others provide care in the home for different patient populations. RSH's unique position allows them to be a conduit for other in-network providers. Although many would see these players as competitors, they are actually immediate and long-term referral partners for RSH. For example, if RSH successfully engages a patient and is looking to navigate them to other care options outside of the ED, Dispatch Health would be a potential referral destination. In most major urban areas where RSH will focus, Dispatch Health may not have the on-demand availability that RSH will need. In fact, RSH has already referred patients to Dispatch in their pilots.

**Clinical / Product**

**CMS' ET3 Model:** Emergency Triage, Treat, and Transport (ET3) is a voluntary, five-year payment model, launched by CMS (first performance period began Jan 1st, 2021), that provides greater flexibility to ambulance care teams to address non-emergency health care needs of Medicare FFS beneficiaries following a 911 call. Participants in the ET3 Model will receive payment for ambulance services for transport to alternative destinations at the appropriate emergency Basic Life Support (BLS-E) or emergency Advance Life Support, Level 1 (ALS1-E) rate. ET3 attempted to address the financial incentive for EMS but failed to address practical issues of setting up the navigator service for SDoH issues, contracting with payers, and identifying and coordinating with alternate site locations. RSH directly addresses these shortcomings with its approach.

**RSH Inbound Model:** RSH is looking to scale an ET3-like payment model around the country for both government and commercial payers. RSH's model has 5 main components:

*   **911 initiated service:** Patient calls 911 dispatch and fire/ambulance arrives at home.
*   **Telehealth initiation:** Medic determines non-emergency under normal clinical protocol. There is no requirement for medics to check insurance or eligibility for a patient. For example, in Maryland, EMT's already assign clinical priority 1 through 4 for patients based on strict protocols. They would initiate a RSH

## Slide 11: How RightSite Works

telehealth visit from their smartphone or internet-enabled device for all patients priority 3 and 4.
*   **RSH Evaluation:** RSH ER physician spends 15-20 minutes evaluating patients and then shifts to navigator (trained for SDoH) who spends another 30-45 minutes navigating best next steps for care.
*   **In-Network Navigation:** Patient receives a telehealth visit in place, is navigated to urgent care (or best care destination), set up for prescription delivery, or referred to other community organizations. Additionally, RightSite can provide near immediate notification to the payor of the patient's disposition (patient going to UCC or ED).
*   **Follow-up Service:** Navigator performs a 24-hour follow up and SDoH survey, updates care management team at plan and PCP, and may have even more proactive outreach over the next few weeks/months for frequent ED users.

**+ How RightSite Works**
*Visual Flowchart depicting the RSH Inbound Model*

1.  **Initial Event:**
    *   Member calls 911 for non-emergency condition. Ambulance arrives.
    *   Medic determines patient's condition is not an emergency.
2.  **RightSite Intervention:**
    *   Medic offers patient an immediate telehealth ER call.
    *   Medic initiates video telehealth call with RightSite board certified ER MD.
    *   No patient behavior change needed.
3.  **RightSite Evaluation & Navigation:**
    *   RightSite ER MD performs telehealth visit and determines needed care.
    *   RightSite Navigator coordinates patient to appropriate in network provider.
    *   Navigator calls patient for satisfaction and SDOH survey 24 hours later.
4.  **Outcome (Avoiding ER):**
    *   Member avoids unnecessary prolonged ER visit and out of network bill.
    *   EMS avoids low acuity trips to ER and more available for true emergencies.
    *   Plan recognizes savings and delivers high quality care.
5.  **Continued Support:**
    *   RightSite Navigator provides SDOH and health access support for 30-days

**RSH Outbound Model:** While the inbound model is expected to drive a majority of RSH's revenue over the next 2-3 years, it can also work with payers to establish a proactive outreach service for frequent ER patients. RSH's navigators, trained in health psychology and motivational interviewing techniques, form relationships with these patients to identify the root causes of their otherwise avoidable ER use. Navigators then offer personalized navigation to appropriate in-network local clinical and social need resources for these patients.

**Tech Platform:** In order to properly architect and engineer its future proprietary platform, RSH launched with off-the-shelf tech during its initial implementation to better define clinical and operational workflows. Today, the four main components of the platform are Salesforce for its CRM, Dialpad for its call center software, Doxy for video conferencing, and AdvancedMD for its in-house EMR. Additional product development features are shown below in the roadmap.

## Slide 13: RSH Product Roadmap 2022 - 2023

This technology infrastructure can not only improve operations and care margins by making physicians and navigators more efficient, but RSH is also the data originator of a unique SDoH dataset for patients who struggle to access the current healthcare system. The future platform will also allow for near-real time data exchange with health plans to help them better manage quality scores with these patients.

**Business Model:** RSH's business model has all the characteristics we look for in scalable and capital efficient care delivery models - efficient patient acquisition, high $ / defined episode, and 50+% care margins. The description below walks through RSH's model for inbound/911-initiated services, which includes a FFS telehealth fee and 50% gainshare. The outbound model is a simpler PMPM model (~$75 PMPM rate based on initial conversations).

*   **Efficient patient acquisition:** RSH is leveraging the current 911/EMS infrastructure, asks EMTs to follow the current clinical protocol, and requires no change in behavior for patients.
*   **High $ / defined episode:** RSH can generate revenue of up to ~$1,000 per episode (2-3 hours + intermittent follow-up over days/weeks) by offering a payor guarantee on the gainshare. This model is extremely rare and only possible because RSH has clean attribution and the payment is never made until the payer sees that attribution.
*   **50+% care margins:** Effectively leveraging SDoH navigators, many of whom worked with Jamo at TAVHealth.

## Slide 15: Efficient Patient Acquisition Model

**Efficient patient acquisition:** To demonstrate the power of this patient acquisition model, consider AFRD and MAAS, two EMS agencies RSH has already engaged with which have ~200K annual transports between them. By partnering with 2 EMS agencies and without disrupting medics or patients' typical workflow, RSH could acquire 20K+ patients annually.

*   **Clinically avoidable:** 41% of patients are eligible for RSH given clinical status and priority based on claims analysis above for avoidable ED visits taken by ambulance (vs. walk-in)
*   **Captured:** 40% of patients are captured based on Y2 ramp up. "Captured" patients are those clinically-eligible patients for which the medic activates the RSH telehealth visit, which then triggers the 99204/5 telehealth reimbursement for RSH. Management has been appropriately conservative with this number assuming that, in the moment, some medics may be overcautious and take clinically eligible patients to the ED regardless of recommendation.
*   **Success:** Success is defined as an eligible, captured patient that consents to care and RSH successfully navigates them to that alternate site. We assume that the "success rate” is 67% with slight haircuts for patient consent and availability at alternate sites.

**Chart: RSH Patient Acquisition Example: 200K Annual EMS Transports**

*   **Annual EMS Transports:** 200K
    *   (59%) **Non-avoidable ED Trips:** 118K
        *   ED Cost and EMS transport
    *   (41%) **Clinically Avoidable:** 82K
        *   (60%) **Avoidable, not captured:** 49K
            *   ED Cost and EMS transport
        *   (13%) **Captured, no consent ED:** 11K
            *   ED, EMS transport, RSH Telehealth Fee
        *   (27%) **Captured + consent:** 22K
            *   EMS incentive, Alternate Site, RSH Telehealth, 50% Gainshare

## Slide 16: $ / Episode Analysis

**$ / Episode:** Below is the impact on an individual patient successfully diverted to an alternate site of care from a payer's perspective. The savings for a payer for a successful diversion is $1,004 and the revenue for RSH is $1,147 ($1,004 from gainshare + $143 telehealth fee).

*   **Before RSH:** Patient is transported to ED and payer pays ED costs and EMS transport fee.
*   **After RSH:** Payer pays $400 to EMS for financial incentive - the "No Transport Fee", $143 for CPT 99204/5 RightSite Telehealth Evaluation, and $250 for transportation (e.g., Uber) and/or urgent care visit. The net savings prior to Gainshare for this patient $2,007 ($2800 - $793).

**>50% Care Margins:** Given the pilot data to-date, RSH estimates their ED physician will require 20-30 minutes per visit since the physician is not on the phone for the entirety of the call. Navigators will spend an average of 40-60 minutes on the call (including time with a physician). With these ratios, RSH can support ~500 trips per month with 8 FTE navigators (1 call center lead + 7 other navigators) at $55K - $80K annual salary and 3 ED physicians paid part-time rate of $135/hr and $25/call. With these assumptions, RSH has a potential care margin (revenue minus patient care expenses) of 78.5%. For reference, Oak Street Health has a contribution margin of ~25% for mature centers and other creative care delivery models that leverage financial / labor arbitrage (e.g., sending NPs to senior living facilities for FFS primary care) leads to ~50% care margins.

**GTM**

From a payer perspective, RSH will be a local in-network credentialed provider that is also building a network of partner EMS agencies. EMS agencies view RSH

## Slide 17: GTM (Cont.)

as their advocate in discussions with payers. When RSH launches in a particular region or metro area, the company employs a bottoms-up and tops-down strategy to engage both EMS agencies and payers.

**Payer Contracting Strategy:** In the early days, regional rollouts are more likely due to the local nature of the EMS providers in each county, the limited number of active plans, and RSH's contracting strategy of being a local in-network credentialed provider for speed to contract with payers. During initial conversations with payers, RSH learned that payers value clean attribution in a defined episode, the fact that no additional work is required from the payer to achieve savings, and that RSH is guaranteeing the plan won't lose money.

*   **Clean attribution in a defined episode:** In some population health models looking to reduce unnecessary costs, attribution can be difficult, especially when treating patients with chronic disease. If a payer reduces total cost of care for a CHF patient over a year, for example, it may be difficult to directly attribute the savings to nurse case manager that engaged the patient after discharge, the PCP that checked their blood pressure during follow-up, or telehealth and connected weight scale for in-home care. RSH owns the entire well-defined episode from 911 dispatch to final destination during a matter of hours, not weeks or months. This clean attribution is a rarity in many VBC models.
*   **No additional work:** EMS agencies are typically out-of-network and not a group that payers are used to engaging and contracting with. RSH provides payers with a high-quality network of EMS providers and doesn't ask for any additional services from the payer to identify, stratify, or engage patients.
*   **Guarantee:** The gainshare is never paid by the plan unless the RSH diversion is measurable, which is straightforward given clean and fast attribution mentioned above. With its gainshare model, RSH can guarantee savings for a payer with little economic risk to RSH.

RSH is employing what the company describes as a "wholesale" and "retail" strategy for engaging payers.

*   **Retail:** Go to plans in a region where they've engaged EMS agencies and go to payers in the area 1x1, starting with payers with the highest market share. As a local in-network credentialed provider, RSH has the opportunity to bill

## Slide 18: GTM (Cont.)

telehealth FFS for patients in the field and then demonstrate to payers that RSH is already engaging its members. Data that RSH is already in the field engaging their members is compelling and expedites the contracting process for a gainshare arrangement.
*   **Wholesale:** In states like Texas, Medicaid will reimburse ambulance providers for ET3-like services using procedure codes included in current policy. This policy was implemented in September of 2022. RSH is targeting states with similar policies initially so they can jumpstart the initial GTM as the company continues to prove out the model.

**EMS Strategy:** EMS engagement is a rate-limiting step, but RSH is working to find the right recipe of "push” and “pull'' between EMS management and medics.

There are compelling reasons for EMS management to embrace RSH, including the EMS financial incentive for non-transports and other operational efficiencies (improved response time, reduction in cost per unit hour/cost per response/cost per transport, improved employee staffing and retention, improved collection rates). Even in a situation where RSH has not yet contracted with every plan in an EMS agency's region, the value of RSH to EMS management is more than strong enough to drive adoption given feedback from agencies to-date.

Unlike nurses, who have more autonomy from hospital management, medics are operating by strict protocol under the direction of the EMS medical director. When EMS management mandates and measures that medics call RSH for all low-acuity runs, RSH would expect to see strong adoption. RSH engages with medics at the front end of the engagement to train and educate about the benefits of utilizing RSH. RSH's physician is on location periodically to meet medics, answer questions, and train medics. Navigators and physicians perform training calls at any time w/ medics to walk them through patient interactions. RSH has the unique advantage of seeing these dynamics firsthand, and will look to capitalize on this medic engagement strategy in the coming year.

**Current status:** RSH is executing on this GTM strategy today. Below is the current status of conversations across 5 geographies.

**Financials**

**Key Assumptions and Scenarios:** The major assumptions and key levers that drive the business include both revenue (cost of the avoidable ED visit and gainshare %) and cost (reduced care efficiency) drivers. Virtue modeled out different scenarios to gain confidence that the business model would not break down with changing assumptions. Total captured trips remain constant for changing assumptions ED costs and gainshare, while total captured trips are decreased in the reduced care efficiency scenario.

*   **Original:** RSH assumed $2,400 cost for avoidable ED visit in their model and 50% gainshare of net savings to payers. Total captured trips in Y2 are ~5,000.
*   **$1,200 ED visit:** Virtue modeled out a scenario where average ED costs are only $1,200 (50% of RSH assumptions) based on feedback from industry reference calls. This brings the savings per successful service down from

$933 to $333, RightSite's total fee $1,147 from to $546 and care margins from 79.6% to 60.1%.
*   **25% Gainshare:** The 50% gainshare is modeled based on current payer conversations and other successful VBC providers, such as Landmark and Aspire Health, that have negotiated a 50% gainshare. If RSH is only able to secure a 25% gainshare initially or the 50% gainshare erodes over time (e.g., "benchmark creep”), then the savings per successful service for payers jumps to $1,434, RightSite's total fee decreases to $644 and care margins decrease to 65%. Total captured trips in Y2 remain ~5,000.
*   **Reduced "Care Efficiency" (e.g., Higher patient care costs for less patients):** In previous care delivery models, we've seen management teams severely underestimate the costs of providing care. Even with an experienced management team, we took the most aggressive cuts for patient care cost and efficiency assumptions. We assumed navigators and staff were 1/2 as efficient (e.g., could only handle 50% of the assumed captured trips), added 2 more navigators, and doubled physician pay and time per call. These changes decrease the overall care margin to 47.5%. Total captured trips in Y2 are reduced to ~2,500.

The chart below summarizes these scenarios and considers only inbound revenue. To account for scale-up, to accurately represent care margins and for consistency across scenarios, care margin percentage (%) was assumed based on Y2 overall revenue and patient care inputs and then applied to an individual episode. The payer savings a successful service - $933 - is less than the $1,004 mentioned above because this includes the cost for patients where telehealth was billed but not diverted to ED (e.g., captured, but not successful). Total revenue numbers for Y1 and Y2 are based on conservative assumptions from management about overall eligibility and capture rates. Given these assumptions and conversations with industry references, Virtue has confidence RSH can reach $2M - $3M in revenue in Y2 based only on the regions they are in discussion with today.

*Per Episode Analysis Based on Virtue Scenario and Assumptions *Inc. Care Inputs*

We walked through the total patient flow for EMS above for 200K EMS transports, savings for an individual patient from a payer perspective, and then tested different assumptions to make sure the business model didn't break. To bring this all together and demonstrate how RSH can build a $50M+ business in 3-5 geographies, we looked at the overall revenue potential for Cobb County and MAAS still assuming 41% clinical eligibility, 40% capture, and 67% success rate. If RSH can successfully launch in 5 regions, even at 50% of the numbers below for 1 region, the company can drive $50M+ in top-line.

**Key Milestones**

## Slide 22: Key Milestones (Cont.)

Virtue is leading a $6M seed financing at a $17.5M post-money valuation with a $900K check for 5.14% fully-diluted ownership. Key milestones for this round are executing payer contracts with gainshare arrangement, demonstrating operational scale in a few communities, and building out the business infrastructure.

*   **Payer contracts:** Over the next 12-18 months, RSH can demonstrate the company can execute on 1-2 gainshare arrangements with payers. This ability to validate the payer GTM motion is key in securing a strong Series A. RSH is furthest along in TX with Aetna Better Health and Molina, but has multiple other payers in the pipeline. We have confidence that the management team can not only get in front of the right payers, but secure and execute these multiple contracts before the next round.
*   **Demonstrate operational scale:** Jamo has experience from TAV (and is bringing many professionals that have worked with him to RightSite) in how to build a team to effectively manage patients at scale. Prior to the Series A, RSH can iterate on the EMS workflow (e.g., hours of availability, boots on the ground engagement with medics, etc) and streamline RSH navigator and provider workflow to show line of sight to attractive care margins at scale.
*   **Build out business infrastructure:** RSH is looking to have 9 total FTEs in the SG&A by the summer of 2023. In addition to the current CEO, CFO, VP Ops and CMO, RSH plans to bring on a VP of Sales, VP of EMS Services, a program operations manager, and 2 engineers. The CMO will act as the ED physician initially and RSH plans to bring on 7 navigators as well. Navigators and ED physician headcount growth is volume dependent.

RSH can hit these 3 key milestones and de-risk GTM and operational risks to prepare for true scale at the Series A.

**Opportunities / Risks**

**Opportunities**

*   **Right partner, right time:** The increased number of ED visits, EMS transports, and EMS agency struggles (reimbursement, staffing, funding) are coming to a head after COVID. EMS is a necessary part of the overall healthcare system but lacks partners that can help them unlock dollars so they can be paid based on the value they provide vs. simply by transport and mileage.

## Slide 23: Opportunities / Risks (Cont.)

*   **Reduced payer sales cycle:** The biggest risk for many seed care delivery businesses is securing their first 1-2 payer contracts. RSH has shown momentum with payers in multiple geographies prior to raising external capital. We often see a "snowball effect” with these successful delivery models early where initial ROI with payers expedites contracting with other payers in that region or payers in a new region. While maybe unsurprising given the management team's experience and relationships, we always index heavily on teams that can sell.
*   **High care margin business (50+%):** Companies like Dispatch Health, Ready Responders, and many others in the in-home tele-emergency space are taking advantage of similar trends of care moving towards the home and focusing on reducing avoidable ED visits. These businesses have struggled to scale because of the logistics of managing and optimizing supply and demand for people, vehicles, and devices. RSH's clever model leverages current EMS infrastructure and thoughtfully leverages telehealth and back-end provider-facing technology to enable scale with high care margins.

**Risks (+ mitigation strategies)**

*   **Incentivizing EMS:** If EMS agencies and the medics on the ground are not bought into RSH, the model may be difficult to scale. Medics do not want to change their workflow or protocols and will likely not be incentivized to use RSH if they are only utilizing RSH telehealth navigators and ED physicians for a small subset of patients covered by a certain insurance provider. RSH is mitigating this risk with their clear value prop to EMS agencies and medics (e.g., push and pull strategy), fitting into the current clinical triage protocol EMS agencies already employ, and emphasizing its value prop (e.g., improving capacity and operational efficiencies) even when medics arrive at the home of a member of a plan that RSH has not yet contracted with.
*   **Payer contracting:** If RSH is unable to get gainshare arrangements with payers, the company will struggle to build a big business on FFS telehealth fees alone. Other comps in market (Landmark, Aspire Health, etc) have shown that its 50% gainshare arrangement has precedent and is durable over time. In addition, RSH has already verbally agreed with Aetna Better Health (ABH) under these terms. RSH has been laser-focused on taking payer feedback and

## Slide 24: Risks (+ mitigation strategies) (Cont.)

emphasizing its clean, attributable model that requires no additional work from the payer to expedite these conversations as well.
*   **Longer-term outcomes:** RSH can stop an avoidable ED visit at the point and time that a patient calls 911. However, how do payers know that the same patient will not come back to the ED a month later with worsening symptoms that end up costing the payer more money? While not the emphasis of the model today, RSH's outbound strategy gives payers the opportunity to dispatch RSH proactively to high-utilizers. RSH already has a relationship with these patients, which enables a smooth hand-off and improves engagement, retention, and overall outcomes.
