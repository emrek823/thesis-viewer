The Current Reality

## Medical Record Retrieval is Hard

Your team spends hours every day on tasks that technology should handle instantly

### Hours of Manual Work

Your specialists spend 2-3 hours per case just finding the right facilities to contact, turning detective work into your biggest expense.

### Patient Memory Problems

Patients can't remember where they received care, leaving your team to guess.

### Disconnected Systems

Data sits in silos, requests get lost in email chains, and there's no unified view of your retrieval operations.
