What does JPM fundraise look like?

Big pharma.

We need to sign with more big pharma. Sanofi is imminent and get started for early september

Novartis and J&J and another thing BMS

BMS - predict PTRS to do everything. Tempus asked for that. Prognosis for line of therapy transfer. Are you going to match I/E criteria but when are you going to become available

PTS is next. Interim

Academic

MD Anderson

major DOD grant - implemented at MD Anderson

GUI - cardiotoxicity in research capacity but we’re working with clinicians

UCSD

Mt Sinai -

Mayo / Dana Farber - internally

Cedars-Sinai

Servicing startups and vendors

Hope AI

Prudentia

Very much in commercial space and data rooms. This could be cool because commercial is  huge part of trial design

Nash Bio

Non-profits

Children's Brain tumor network

UK Biobank -

NHS

Pharma

Sanofi

If you get the right peson, you have a ton of data. He controls data for training

Quant Health - put the kobash on some of that

Very broad - do immunology. $150M or $50M

VP of Development IT. bring innovation and AI to all aspects of drug development

Sanofi wants to be the best and known as the best. Incredibly ambitious trials

½ of Ph I to be in silico. They don’t wany any actual control arms

If they get 50% of the way there,

The way this person works is he does all the internal convos to make sure no one

Portfolio optimization

Not just a single trial to design a trial thats a collection of patients

Digital twins or synthetic control arms

Optimizing for I/E critera from devleopment (site selection, enrollment rates) to maximize PTRS for certain I/E Criteria

Bringing the impact of downstream market

Roche example resonates - increasing appeittie to make use of data to do thing

Not just about preidciting but then designing things to optimize that. More narrow approval

Novartis

Conversations up and down the chain.

CDO @ Officer Novatis

J&J

David Apfel

1 of our advisors former boss is the chief data officer at J&J

Data, money, prestige (we don’t care insofar as it helps with

We want to be the standard representation of what it means to be a patient. Predict whatever it means to for that patient. You can optimize go / no-go from pre clinical to clincial. Optimize patient

AMC and pharma are intrisnically linked. SOC and drug development gets driven by AMC and that will change the way pharma marketing is done

Quite backbone of every from CDS to drug devleopment

90% of biomedical is the same. Last 10% has to

$

Continue to buy access

Monetary position to basically give it away for AMCs

Licnesing high qualtiy biobank. KPBB

FinGen -

We’ve validated interest across multiple types of customers

90% vs. 10% has been validated

We have better models

How much we’re looking to raise? I would like to raise $40M. Here is what we’ve done as a playbook and we’re going to do it and I want to go that big. To get there, we need to be deeply entrenched in AMC. The research side is OK. For exactly how it gets monetized by pharma once honeymoon period is over. They are selling innovation and now this is entrenched in our process

We are more valuable to AMCs the more data we have. Thats first thing

2nd thing - forward deployed engineers. That has gotten more scalable then it used to be. We can make GUI in a day.

Erik - building a team around him. Build a team around him and be super confident and humble.

Talent pipeline / hiring convos. Companies today as early as possible and turning the corner from seed to A who are considered and perceived to be these magnets of talent. Enthusiasm and excitement around AI and your ability to build and have true best in class (

We’ve been aware of this.

Head of engineer - David Laprade (upper echelon). He was not the #1 but top 20%

That’s the talent minimum - its great that

Chief Scientist - Zak

Zak - BMS wrote publication in week for tier 1 AI/ML

Noetik

Lead scientist on virtual cell program.

Foundation model and stimulating collections of cell

BD - need to be really good for that

Erik - customer engagement but the actual sort of BD

Going back and forth - doing this thing with Cedars-Sinai. We’re going to be starting with Sanofi in September and we would love somewhere

Why I like him?

Extreemly personable

Understands pharma and doesn’t like it

Hiring optics - AI/ML @ Prometheus. Platform was part of their brand

Concerns

Geographic - SF presence for branding + talent. SF-centric

James Zhou lab, couple people at great labs. Worked at google previously and weren’t on the level we needed

Guy who led PathAI development at

Couple people i have in mind. Weights & biases - Eric. One of their head BD people - he’s in the rooms with Meta’s VPs. Selling to Adobe and BMS and everyone else

Kept saying no to high quality candidates. Got it

Tempus

I know the following things

I had a conversation with Junstin Ginney on the bio side and somewhat involved in their foundation model. SKIP on the foundation mdoel team - not clear where he sits with it

Tempus buys a lot of models that they use and they are continuing that path

Talked to Iker - CEO of Pathos. When Iker was at AZ, they raised Series D on building a foundation model with Tempus. I know that’s happening and from people inside AZ (multiple levels)

More or less, the Tempus thing needs to be successful go figure out how

I also know - former direct reports (great guy, solid DS) - fairly good on the application side. He’s on the foundational model team and last

What their goals? Limited access and size where not everyone is going to want to share data? How do they view their talent limitations? I think that’s going to be hard for Tempus to hire?

Big public company thing - they are going to have a hard time moving quickly

When they run out of data, what are they going to do?

Is it priority for company or is it just something to do to help you raise?

Would they be open to people being a supplier?

Owkin brand inside Sanofi is not so great right now

We are going to get data. Models that are trained on 10s of millions

Go live in September

Want Sanofi NVIDIA and MD ANderson and get those boom boom boom into JPM

Look at

Why are you so focused on prognosis
