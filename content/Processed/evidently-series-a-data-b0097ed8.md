## Slide 1: Great Point Ventures Q&A

Think they will do $11.6M ARR by EOY 2026
Sep 19, 2024 Great Point Ventures Q&A
As one follow up, can you please outline which product capability / use case is being sold for customers currently in contracting and in the pipeline. Can you also double click into the GTM plan over the next 18 months by product offering value prop and customer type.

Nearly all engagements start from a clinical leader being attracted to our chart review functionality and it's ability to enhance patient care and provider wellness. For providers who spend over a third of their day in chart review, this is life changing. They then see that Evidently also has a quantifiable financial ROI for their system, and the deal moves more quickly through the approval process. There is one main product, EvidentlyOne, that is available for customers, however we include various modules depending on the customer needs/desires and these are specifically included/excluded in contracts for future upsell opportunities.

Currently available:
EvidentlyOne: primary chart review and summarization, self-service customized smartReports = EO
Optional Modules:
*   Ambulatory HCC – complexity coding for ambulatory use = A
*   Inpatient CDI – complexity coding for inpatient use = I
*   Standard CDS Modules = S
*   Custom CDS Modules = C
*   Documentation = D

### PATH TO $20M ARR AND BEYOND

| 2024          | 2025         | 2026         |
| :------------ | :----------- | :----------- |
| **$2M ARR**   | **$8M ARR**  | **$20M ARR** |
| **Pricing:** $100K / $1B Rev = 30X ROI | $500K / $1B Rev = 10X ROI | $1M / $1B Rev = 5X ROI |

**Pricing Strategy:** Enterprise-wide contract using a customer's annual patient generated revenue as benchmark for pricing.
**Pricing target:** Initial pricing of $100k/$1B of Customer revenue yielded 30x ROI for customers. Market comps yield a 3-5x ROI. We are adjusting our pricing target to $1M/$1B in customer revenue and will still be able to demonstrate 5x ROI and exploring revenue sharing agreements to hit this target faster.
