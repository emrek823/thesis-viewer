### Founders’ Background

- Peter:
	- Mechanical engineering/robotics background from UIUC
	- Founded Zero to One startup incubator at UIUC
	- Worked at Neuralink for 2 years, built first robot for human implants
	- Focus on sensors, robotics, mechatronics
- Lukas:
	- Computer Science from Technical University of Munich
	- Experience at SAP integrating process automation (Signavio)
	- Stanford University fellowship
	- Co-founded Stanford Founders (largest graduate entrepreneurship organization)

### Problem & Market Discovery

- Identified gap in senior care through 500+ hours of volunteer work
- Initially started as B2C product for older adults
- Pivoted to B2B ~4 months ago after feedback from ChenMed executive
- Current focus: Automated patient outreach for value-based care providers
- Key insight: Providers spending hundreds of hours on manual phone check-ins

### Product Solution

- AI voice agent (named Minerva) specifically designed for older adults
- Key differentiator: Specialized AI for senior engagement
	- More patient and colloquial approach
	- Handles distractions and non-linear thoughts
	- Builds familiarity and trust
- Technology challenges with seniors:
	- They don’t communicate like younger users
	- Example: Northeast Medical Services failed automation attempt due to seniors getting confused
	- Phone calls preferred over apps/WiFi solutions

### Business Model & ROI

- Target customers: Value-based care providers and hospitals
- Key ROI metrics:
	- Reduced hospitalizations
	- Reduced staff burden
	- Increased capture of billable codes
	- Improved patient satisfaction
	- Lower readmission rates
- Estimated savings: ~$500k/year for provider with 1,000 patients

### Next Steps & Status

- Currently angel funded and bootstrapped
- Seeking paid pilot within next month
- Planning to raise pre-seed after securing pilot
- Looking to hire founding engineer
- VirtueVC team to discuss in Monday morning partner sync and provide feedback next week
- Founders to send additional materials
