01/16/2025 . 1:10 pm - 1:55 pm

Eliminating Medicare’s coverage limits on stays in freestanding inpatient psychiatric facilities

Staff Contacts:

**ISSUE:** Medicare applies limits to the coverage of treatment in inpatient psychiatric facilities (IPFs)—a lifetime limit of 190 days at freestanding IPFs and a reduction to a beneficiary’s initial benefit period depending on prior use of freestanding IPF care. In response to a Congressional request, the Commission reported in June 2023 on the use and availability of behavioral health services for Medicare beneficiaries, including the impact of the 190-day lifetime limit on freestanding IPF use.

**KEY POINTS:** In the fall, commissioners examined results showing shifts in settings of care for beneficiaries who near the 190-day limit and discussed the Chair’s draft recommendation to eliminate coverage limits on IPF care.

**ACTION:** Commissioners will review the findings and vote on the draft recommendation.

01/17/2025 . 10:30 am - 12:00 pm

Reducing beneficiary cost-sharing for outpatient services at critical access hospitals

Staff Contacts:

**ISSUE:** The critical access hospital (CAH) program, enacted by the Congress in 1997, provides cost-based Medicare payments to certain rural hospitals with 25 or fewer beds. Beneficiary cost-sharing liability for most fee-for-service Medicare outpatient services at CAHs also higher than at other hospitals, since it is set at 20 percent of charges, rather than 20 percent of the Medicare payment amount.

**KEY POINTS:** In September 2024, staff presented results from an analysis that showed that outpatient cost-sharing liability at CAHs averaged about half of total Medicare payments for those services in 2022 and varied widely due to differences in markups across CAHs and across services within CAHs.

**ACTION:** Commissioners will review CAH cost-sharing policies and discuss the Chair’s draft recommendation to modify cost-sharing liability for beneficiaries who receive care at CAHs.
