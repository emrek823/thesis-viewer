## Slide 8: Ferring Example: Commercial / Distribution

**Ferring Example: Commercial / Distribution**

**OBGYN's are ideally positioned to expand the fertility marketplace with INVOcell by addressing the capacity challenges**

**INVOcell within OBGYN practices**
*   INVOcell requires less sophisticated equipment and lab resources than traditional IVF
*   Provides a scalable model for practices and an affordable, advanced and effective treatment option

**Currently, OBGYNs miss revenue opportunities = many patients are unable to afford IVF**

*Diagram:*
*   Two overlapping circles. One labeled "F Clinics:" and the other "Larger # of OBGYN Offices".
*   A large purple oval encircles both these circles and extends to a text box labeled "Evvy Untapped patients who don't have OBGYN relationship".

**Leverage biomarkers to close the gender health gap**
(to do this, we have to prove our data is valuable)

1.  **Innovate on characterizations of health / disease & personalized care — DATA**
    *   Identifying differences across strains that inform metadata outcomes
    *   SAGE database live
2.  **Power scientific & medical community — CREDIBILITY**

**Evvy Care Economics**

| Category           | Details                                                         |
| :----------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Price**          | Two price points for consumer to purchase 2 months of care:     |
|                    | • $149 for 2 months ($74 per month) - *if Evvy's costs are <$100* |
|                    | • $199 for 2 months ($99 per month) - *if Evvy's costs are $100-$160* |
| **Unit costs to Evvy** | • Consultation (doctor review): $14                             |
|                    | • Fulfillment: $14 (shipping and packaging)                     |
|                    | • Treatments: $69 - $131 (for 2 months)                         |
| **Gross Margin on Evvy Care** | • ~25%                                                          |
|                    | • With scale closer to 40%                                      |

## Slide 20: Risks

**Risks**

| Category    | Risk Description                                                               |
| :---------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Business** | Conversion from test to care (including risks around pricing and demand)       |
|             | Pushback from any doctors / medical community                                  |
| **Lab**     | Switching lab / wet lab processes — operational burden with different tests    |
|             | Dependency on MDX                                                              |
|             | Bioinformatics — lots of open questions on how to solve                        |
| **Regulatory** | HIPAA — not compliant today                                                    |
|             | CLIA / CAP / CLEP approval                                                     |
|             | Really careful about not marketing compounded treatments to consumers          |

## Slide 34: SAGE Database

**SAGE Database**

*SAGE logo*

*   **SAGE includes:**
    *   **4315 genomes representing 712 species**
    *   Much higher fidelity than what we have now
        *   Better representation of Lactobacillus, Gardnerella, STIs and Yeast!
        *   It will be turned into a gene catalogue for MDX's analysis

**Uses:**

1.  **MDX Bioinformatics Pipeline Generation**
2.  **Genome comparisons**

**Compared to:**

*   **VIRGO:**
    *   **unknown number of genomes - 264 species**
        *   It is a gene catalogue of 0.95 million non-redundant genes

## Slide 35: SAGE Database - Projects

**SAGE Database - Projects**

*SAGE logo*

*   **Species comparisons:**

**Are these bacteria really the same species or a combination of species?**

*   Average nucleotide identity (ANI) - New species = 83-95%, New genus <80%
    *   Gardnerella - preliminary data
    *   L. crispatus - preliminary data
    *   L. iners - preliminary data

*Image: Dendrogram showing clustering of species.*

## Slide 36: Gardnerella speciation

**Gardnerella speciation**

*SAGE logo*

*   Multiple Gardnerella species, some named, some not

**Next steps:**

*   Lillian - correlations with Metabolic Maps
*   Include L. crispatus MAGs
*   Do we symptoms correspond to clades?
*   What parts of these genomes are different? Some gene content that is present/absent with symptoms?

*Image: Heatmap displaying Average Nucleotide Identity (ANIb) between various Gardnerella genomes and Alloscardovia omnicolens.*
*   Shows clear clusters identified as:
    *   G. swidsinski
    *   G. leopoldi
    *   G. piotii
    *   G. vaginalis
*   "Not Gardnerella, Alloscardovia omnicolens" is identified as a distinct cluster.
*   ANIb percentage identity scale from 0.00 to 1.00 is shown on the right.
*   Legend indicates species for colored bars next to the heatmap.

## Slide 37: L. crispatus speciation

**L. crispatus speciation**

*SAGE logo*

## Slide 38: Metagenome Assembled Genomes (MAG) Pipeline Update!

**Metagenome Assembled Genomes (MAG) Pipeline Update!**

**Murizio Morri**

Analyzed all 3000 samples!

1.  **Cleaned up and removed Human DNA**

*MAG-D logo*

2.  **MAG-D**
    a.  MAG database - Ran a tool MegaHit on all 6000 samples pooled together
    b.  Generate highly complete MAGs representing all diversity across all samples

*MAG/Sam Diagram: Sample 1 and Sample 2 with multiple colored bars representing different segments/genomes.*

3.  **MAG/Sam**
    a.  Ran MegaHit on each individual sample
    b.  Each sample has a bunch of small scaffolds - or segments - of genomes.

*StF/Sam Diagram: Sample 1 and Sample 2 with grids of small colored squares representing strains.*

4.  **StF/Sam**
    a.  Strains per sample - ran a tool called StrainPhlan
    b.  Output = list of strains found in each sample
    c.  **Caveat** - database used is not vagina-specific. We will re-run as soon as we can with SAGE as the reference

We have all the code for each of these steps! - Genevieve will be working to implement these pipelines for the future.

*   **PCOS** ➤ low Akkermansia, gut dysbiosis, excess insulin production
*   **vaginitis** ➤ BV ➤ L. iners high, other L. sp. Low = L/D lactic acid high
*   **vaginitis** ➤ resistant VVC ➤ Boric acid responsive VVC

**Prognostic**
*   **IVF success**

**Therapeutic development**
*   Many depending on mining ability
*   Peri- and post-menopause
*   Maternal (e.g. pre-term labor, pre-term birth)
