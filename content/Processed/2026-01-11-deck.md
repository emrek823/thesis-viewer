## Slide 4: Revenue Model
Revenue Model

The Biobase Orchestration Layer Enables Three High-Margin Revenue Streams

**Agentic Operating System (SaaS)**
*   → The operating system for connecting, harmonizing, querying, and analyzing multimodal clinical data
*   → Healthcare + Life Sci query their own data silos + federated networks
*   $75k-$450k ARR
*   75-80% Margin

**Federated Biobanking Marketplace**
*   → Federated ecosystem and marketplace for healthcare partners to commercialize digital & physical data assets
*   $75k-$150k avg deal
*   50% rev share margin

**AI App Marketplace**
*   → Deploy in house AI/ agentic models as well as 3rd party AI tools enterprise wide over the Biobase infrastructure
*   $1k-$30k avg/tool/month
*   95% margin

Land Data Pilot ($30k-$120k avg) → Expand (SaaS) → Accelerate (Biobank + AI Marketplace)
