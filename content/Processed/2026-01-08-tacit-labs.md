Tacit enables frontier labs to develop LLM capabilities for the life sciences by collecting high quality data on how science is done.

We imagine a future in which AI is a powerful tool for scientific discovery, capable of helping us reason through complex problems and driving optimal decision-making across discovery and development pipelines.

Tacit collaborates with biotechs and academic labs to evaluate models on high-value, real-world tasks and works with frontier AI labs to systematically improve model performance on those tasks. Data collection will focus on outcome-verifiable, long-horizon planning and reasoning tasks to power the most critical functions in the life sciences.
