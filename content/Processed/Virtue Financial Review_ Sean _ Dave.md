### Backend System Overhaul

- Refactored entire firm operations through Claude and integrated software stack
- Automated data collection from Google Drives, email, texts, web sources
- Terminal-based workflow pulling thousands of data points daily
- Key capabilities:
	- Pattern recognition across data sources
	- Automatic thesis generation based on evidence strength
	- LLM-powered people search via Exa for non-obvious experts (academics, lab researchers)
	- Daily/weekly automated briefings and reports

### Portfolio Updates & Markups

- Zocalo: Series A valuation coming, Q1 mark recognition
	- Not participating in round
- Hermes: $4M SAFE at $18M post signed pre-break
	- Filling out round without Virtue participation
	- Q1 mark once completed
- AnnaSpun: Term sheet signed at $100M post, $8-10M raise
	- Led by Transformation Capital
	- Walked from deal due to poor process behavior

### Transformation Capital Issues

- Extremely onerous due diligence process
- Beat up company over 3-4% delta on trailing contribution margin
- Attempted to carve out Virtue from blanket sale control rights
- Explicitly stated goal to prevent Virtue from advocating early sale
- Historical LP relationship complications:
	- Shared confidential portfolio info (Mural Health) inappropriately
	- Series of sloppy processes below standards
- Decision: No future collaboration, minimal LP updates

### Fund Operations

- GPV merger formally terminated over break
- 50% chance of raising $25M expansion fund
	- Separate vehicle sitting on Fund 2
	- Would allow larger check sizes (65% core fund, 35% expansion)
	- Potential for concentrated investments (e.g., $20M Translucent Series A lead)
- Multiple portfolio term sheets expected next month

### Financial Items

- SmartDX tax distribution from Fund 1 planned Q1
- Most Fund 1 cash will be distributed
- SmartDX acquired by Thoreau (Matt Holt’s new firm from New Mountain Capital)
	- Part of $8-9B acquisition of 4-5 AI healthcare companies
	- June/July earnout timing remains unchanged
- Management fee increase approved for Dave

### Next Steps

- Dave: Handle Translucent SPV Form D filing
- Sean: Send Zocalo original SAFE and Hermes term sheet
- Monitor cash flow between tax distribution and earnout timing
