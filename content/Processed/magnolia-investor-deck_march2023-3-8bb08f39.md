## Slide 16: The current customer experience for managing services for aging at home is complex, costly, opaque and varies in quality.

INVESTOR DECK
The current customer experience for managing services for aging at home is complex, costly, opaque and varies in quality.

**Phases of the Customer Journey (Manual Process)**
*   Awareness and Discovery
*   Consideration and Intent
*   Implementation and Coordination
*   Budgeting and Cash Management

**Challenges:**

**Unexpected crisis**
*   *Excerpt from "Unleashing the Ghost of Home Care: The Case for a National Alzheimer's Disease Home Care Demonstration Project" (2010 Springer Publishing Company)*
    *   Keywords: Alzheimer's disease; dementia; Medicare; home health care, hospice
    *   "...with the disease and their caregivers, who provide most of their at home without any significant eligibility or coverage under Medicare or Medicaid, let alone the $15 billion annual Medicare home health health benefit. This situation also creates a significant cost burden to employers through lost work and productivity of care-giver employees and to the government through increased Medicare and Medicaid hospital and nursing home costs."
    *   "...AD is a major and increasing cause of illness and death in the United States, a disorder that grows along with the aging process. Symptoms include a gradual and steady decline in orientation, a decrease in memory and ability to participate in everyday activities, and personality changes. AD is the most common type of dementia identified in the United States, with over 5 mil-lion persons estimated to have the disease in 2007, including 4.9 million over age 65 (Alzheimer's Association, 2007a, 2007b: U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, 2008). It is the fourth-leading cause of death for Americans aged 65 and older and may only be surpassed..."

**Information overload**
*   Search results for:
    *   "what are the signs of parkinson's disease"
    *   "what are the symptoms of parkinson's disease nhs"
    *   "what are the symptoms of parkinson's disease quizlet"
    *   "what are the symptoms of parkinson disease dementia"

**No single point of contact**
*   *Mobility Equipment Suppliers search results shown, e.g., Morris County Stairlift Rentals, Morris County Stairlifts, The Stairlift Store - Acorn Stairlift.*
    *   Each listing includes rating, address, phone, hours, website, directions.
    *   "let's just say that's not always easy to do these days."
    *   "They installed two stairlifts for us."

**High costs and unexpected bills**
*   *Example Invoice:*
    *   Description: Your item name
    *   Rate: $2,000.00
    *   Qty: 1
    *   Line Total: $2,000.00
    *   Amount Due (USD): $2,000.00
    *   Billed To: Client Name, Street Address, City, State
*   *Final Notice:* "If we do not hear from you within 10 days, this account will be turned over to our collection agency."

## Slide 17: A typical GCM customer journey looks like this. It provides real value to end customers. But it's manual and labor constrained.

INVESTOR DECK
A typical GCM customer journey looks like this. It provides real value to end customers. But it's manual and labor constrained.

**GCM Customer Journey Steps:**

1.  **Journey starts** -> **Older Adults Needs Third Party Support**
2.  **Older Adult or Child Finds GCM** (All word of mouth and referrals. Hard to find GCMs. Expensive. Very few in market today.)
3.  **Intake and Eligibility** (Initial call with older adults and their children. Cost $500.)
4.  **Navigator Consultation** (1-2 hour meeting that is virtual and home based. Cost $1K.)
5.  **Care Plan** (GCM maps care needs to personal network. Some providers good and some are not. Very manual. Costs $3K.)
6.  **Identify Service Providers** (Calls to service providers. Understanding availability. Scheduling with end customer. $8K.)
7.  **Care Team Implementation** (Coordinating service providers in the home. Tracking activities. Centralizing communications and charting.)
8.  **Charting and Invoices** (Preparing and sending invoices and collecting payments.)
9.  **Service Provider Feedback** (Capturing feedback from older adults and their children. Relaying this feedback to service providers.)
10. **Care Needs Evolve** (Introduces new service providers and reconciling billing and re-starting implementation and knowledge share with service providers.)
11. **Health Checks** (Regular check ins with older adults and their children. $1K.)

**Summary:**
Hugely valuable service that is limited by supply of GCMs and undifferentiated heavy lifting that can be scaled with technology. Typical GCM charges $150 - $350 / hour and $3K - 10K / month / client. GCM work is manual with significant time spent on tasks that do not require their expertise.
