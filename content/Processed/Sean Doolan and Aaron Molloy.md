### Aaron’s Background & Paralign Mission

- Former McKinsey consultant (3 years as Chief of Staff to global CEO, then healthcare/public sector practice)
- Unconventional career shift: became EMT in Revere, Massachusetts working 911 ambulance
- Later worked at Parkland Hospital (Dallas) on maternal health funding
- Founded Paralign to bridge gap between health plans and fire/EMS agencies
	- Target: high-cost, hard-to-reach members
	- Method: mobilize fire departments/EMS with preventative care capabilities

### Community Paramedicine Model

- Concept created by fire chiefs 25 years ago to manage rising 911 call volumes
- Proven effectiveness: reduces 911 calls among frequent flyers by up to 80%
- Historical gap: fire/EMS only connected to healthcare at ED drop-off point
- Current fragmentation: hundreds of individual contracts needed between health plans and EMS agencies
- Paralign solution: first clinically integrated network (CIN) for EMS agencies
	- Single contract structure eliminates need for hundreds of separate agreements
	- Platform enables scaling to thousands of lives

### Financial Model & Performance Metrics

- Value-based care from outset (fixed fee model rejected by health plans)
- Revenue structure:
	- Pass-through fees to EMS partners (majority of revenue)
	- Paralign compensation tied to performance pool
- Performance measures (weighted differently):
	- Data capture: HEDIS measures and care gap closure
	- Hit rate: outperform health plan case management teams
	- Utilization: reduce ED visits and hospital days
	- Cost reduction: overall care cost decrease
- Targeting 40% margin per member by years 3-4
- Negotiating advanced PMPM payments with annual true-up

### EMS Agency Economics

- Current model: losing money on typical 911 visits
- Paralign approach: reduce loss-making 911 volume while increasing margin-positive visits
- Rebalances P&L structure toward higher-margin services
- Capacity scaling: existing roster of ~60 patients cycled through 6-9 months
- New patient referrals increasingly through Paralign stream (compensated visits)

### Fundraising & Next Steps

- Raising ~$3M, advanced diligence with 4-5 funds
- Target close: November 2025
- Has full investor data room available
- Geographic focus includes rural markets (Missouri has 200 ambulance districts, 30 community paramedicine programs active, 40 in planning)
- Complementary relationship identified with RightSide Health/MD Ally (different interventions, same outcomes)
