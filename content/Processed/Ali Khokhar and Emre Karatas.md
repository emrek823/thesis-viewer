- Skipped scribes and back-office automation to focus on patient-facing clinical AI
- Built a machine to deploy AI clinicians safely and reliably
- Core technology components:
	- Brain architecture with modular, customizable components
	- Video game analogy: creates both the “brain” of the agent and the “map” it follows
	- Simulation engine that creates high-fidelity representations of patient populations
	- LLM judge system that evaluates agent performance against clinical rubrics
	- API-based deployment for chat/voice completion
	- Production monitoring with continuous improvement loop

### Business Model & Growth

- ACV in 6 figures+ range
- Startup plan available: $30-50K first year
- Compute-based pricing model
	- Same unit of currency for simulations and production
	- Platform includes forward deployed agent engineer (~$4K/month)
- Target customers:
	- Enterprise-centric digital health companies
	- Legacy healthcare systems looking for patient-facing solutions
	- Scribe companies seeking differentiation
	- EHR systems needing competitive advantage

### Next Steps

- Ali to send summary blurb for Emre to forward
- Emre to introduce Ali to Nika Dwan at Virtuevc
	- Ali mentioned already emailing Nika earlier today
