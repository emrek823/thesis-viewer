Supporting Families, Shaping Healthy Futures

## We’ve experienced the reality of pediatric care today.

Everything feels disconnected

Specialists are separated from primary care, placing the responsibility of care coordination directly on families.

Clinicians are overburdened

High caseloads and unsustainable administrative tasks lead to overwhelm and exhaustion.

Distraction is everywhere

Outdated technology and lengthy manual processes force clinic teams to sacrifice time they could spend connecting with patients.

Inefficiencies amplify issues

Ongoing challenges add to clinician burnout and hinder access to timely care for one of the most populations: children.

## Our foundational story

Having personally dealt with finding comprehensive pediatric care for a child with an autoimmune disorder, and the overwhelming stress that can place on a family navigating the system for themselves, our founder and CEO committed himself to the mission of changing the way that pediatric care is delivered.

![zarminali-icon](https://zarminali.com/hubfs/zarminali-icon.svg)

Zarminali is being painstakingly designed by parents like myself who have struggled against the current flaws of our healthcare system and know that every child deserves amazing care, from birth to adulthood. After navigating the broken system with my daughter, I wanted to apply my experience transforming outpatient mental healthcare at LifeStance to improving pediatric care on a national scale. Our initial seed funding is an immense validator and kickstarts our mission to create a world where every child's health journey is seamlessly coordinated, where advanced technology enhances every interaction, and where our clinicians and team members support each family every step of the way.”
