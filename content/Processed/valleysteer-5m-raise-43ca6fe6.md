partners, reducing the administrative burden of
collaboration.

A Golden Opportunity is Emerging for Valley Steer in Value Based Care
From 2019 to 2021, Investment in Value Based Care increased fourfold to $7b*

ek@virtuevc.com - 2024-06-20
ek@virtuevc.com - 2024-06-20
ek@virtuevc.com - 2024-06-20
ek@virtuevc.com

**1 Massive Opportunity for Value Based Care (VBC) Proprietary Models**
Our tests indicate that today's best models and frameworks are both inaccurate (<80%) and costly (~$0.10 per page) for VBC review tasks. We believe the necessary training data for these models does not exist yet, presenting a significant opportunity. We are developing proprietary models that promise lower costs and higher efficacy for VBC.

**2 Increased Scrutiny and Heightened Enforcement of Medicare Coding**
The Department of Justice (DOJ) has significantly intensified efforts to combat Medicare Advantage coding fraud in recent years. The solution isn't simply a better portal with more complicated technology that burdens providers even more; it's about completely rethinking the coding process with AI and technology-enabled services.

**3 FTC Bans Non-Competes in Employment Contracts on April 23, 2024**
Now that non-competes are banned, the only barriers physicians face to return to independent practice are administrative: inadequate infrastructure, financial pressures, resource limitations, and regulatory compliance issues. Our solution aligns payers with independent providers and subsidizes the infrastructure buildout to overcome these challenges.

**AI + Clinicians**
We develop our own software and language
models to reduce costs. Our clinicians then
review the outputs to enhance accuracy.

**Distribution**
We contract directly with payers and
collaborate on distribution to providers,
eliminating the need to sell to each provider
individually.

**Monetization Model**
We align incentives for both payers and
providers, positioning ourselves within the
payment flow without being categorized as
an operating expense.

**Data Reviewed By Clinicians
(Not Admin Staff)**
Our service is unique in the
industry, as we are the only
ones utilizing practicing
clinicians to review clinical data,
unlike our competitors who
depend on administrative
nurses or coders following strict
protocols.

**No Upfront OpEx Costs**
Our unique business model is
performance-based, charging
payers only for measurable
results, ensuring our success
aligns with theirs.

**AI with Humans in the Loop**
Utilizing advanced large
language models, we've
created a cutting-edge multi-
agent framework, incorporating
clinician oversight to ensure our
inferences are both cost-
effective and highly accurate.

**Minimum Data Integration**
Our models and staff, trained on
millions of documents, require
only a minimal random data
sample to accurately gauge our
potential impact with a
customer.

**Payer-Subsidized Back Office**
Providers are already incurring
administrative burden for data reconciliation,
coding, and billing of claims. However for
Annual Wellness Visits, a significant part of
the back-office expenses will be subsidized
by the payers we work with.

**Minimal Workflow Changes**
We understand the administrative burdens
on PCP's, therefore we integrate our support
into their existing workflows, ensuring they
benefit from our services without direct
interaction with our technology.

**Not Another Provider Portal**
We simplify the process by not adding
another portal for providers to manage.
Instead, we integrate with existing payer
portals or adapt to the provider's preferred
communication method, whether it's fax,
email, or direct mail / in-person.

**Annual Wellness Visit (AWV)**

An AWV is a preventive healthcare appointment
where a patient meets with their healthcare provider
to review their overall health and wellness.

**AWV Incentive Payment Breakdown:**

*   Admin Fees / Valley Steer Potential: 66%
*   Valley Steer Fee: 25%
*   Medical Fees: 9%

The majority (>80%) of an AWV can be performed by
non-clinical staff including: Patient Intake and History
Review, Measurement and Vital Signs, Screening
Questionnaires, Review of Preventative Services,
Health Education and Counseling, Documentation and
Data Entry.

Valley Steer currently takes a 25% fee from an AWV
payment, with the potential to increase to a 90%
take rate by assuming additional administrative
tasks.

10x Payer Return On Investment Breakdown
A Standard Annual Wellness Visit Payment is Approximately $200 - $300 per Member per Year.

ek@virtuevc.com - 2024-06-20
ek@virtuevo.com - 2024-06-20
ek@virtuevc.com - 2024-06-20
ek@virtuevc.com

**10x Payer Return On Investment Breakdown (per member per year):**

*   **Risk Adjustment Boost:** $2,000
*   **Retrospective Review Fees:** $100
*   **Cash Acceleration:** $200
*   **MLR / DM Impact\*:** $200
*   **Return on Investment:** $2,500

A real time review system
typically yields 2 additional
chronic disease diagnoses,
which is worth an additional
$2,000 per member per year
for payers.

Additional savings come from
the reduction of
retrospective review fees,
acceleration of cash and
earlier management of
chronic disease.

*Medical Loss Ratio improvement will result from earlier detection and management of chronic disease.

yet these payments still take up to 90 days to process.

**Payer Partnerships (Example PCP)**

*   **Starting Payer:** 20% of Patient Panel
*   **United Health:** 30% of Patient Panel
*   **Aetna:** 30% of Patient Panel
*   **Cigna:** 20% of Patient Panel

**Step 1: Leveraging Payer Relationship To Enable The PCP**
Since payers collaborate with hundreds to thousands of primary care physicians (PCPs), we partner with payers to streamline their payments to PCPs and subsidize the development of the PCPs' coding and reconciliation infrastructure, enhancing efficiency and accuracy in their financial operations.

**Step 2: Leverage Enabled PCP's to Partner With New Payer**
After establishing the coding and reconciliation infrastructure with one PCP, we leverage this investment to expand our services to additional payers that the primary care physicians (PCPs) are contracted with, particularly within the same geography. This approach maximizes the utility of the infrastructure across multiple payer relationships, streamlining processes for PCPs.

Why It Takes >90 Days To Get Incentives Paid Today
Payment processing for a PCP visit may extend up to 90 days due to difficulties in accessing and organizing
disorganized data. Our first step involves collaborating with payers to expedite payments to PCP's.

**Revenue Cycle Management**

Revenue Cycle Management (RCM)
companies primarily aim to optimize
providers' compensation for delivered
services. Their economic model is largely built
around hospitals and specialty practices,
where billing complexities abound. These
firms excel in navigating intricate billing
environments, striving to ensure that
providers secure maximum reimbursement
for their services.

Example Companies:
CodaMetrix, AKASA, Fathom, Nym, Adonis,
Hippocratic AI

**Portals / Middleware Platforms**

Payers utilize a mix of proprietary / vendor
portals, and middleware platforms to
enhance communications with providers.
While at a glance our services may seem
akin, we do not offer provider-facing
technology. Instead, we power the backend,
focusing on interpreting and reconciling
unstructured data. Currently, we are in talks
with numerous companies in this space to
enhance their capabilities

Example Companies:
Clover Assistant, Stellar Health, Optum,
Availity
