# NCPA to CMS: A Third of Independent Pharmacies Won’t Carry Drugs in the Negotiated Price Program, and 60 Percent More are Considering Dropping Out

**ALEXANDRIA, Va. (Jan. 27, 2025) –** The National Community Pharmacists Association today submitted comments to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services with a stern warning that more than 90 percent of independent pharmacies may decide, or have already decided, to not stock drugs in the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program because they will cause massive financial losses and potentially put them out of business.

“Pharmacies will have to float thousands of dollars every month waiting for refunds from the manufacturers. That will cause a massive cash flow problem in an environment where thousands of pharmacies have already closed,” **said NCPA CEO B. Douglas Hoey.**

In its comments, NCPA cited a recent national survey of independent pharmacists that found a jaw-dropping 93.2 percent of respondents have already decided to not stock the drugs in the program, or they are considering not stocking them.

“That will be devastating to the program,” **said Hoey.** “Patients who need these prescriptions will be unable to get them, because their pharmacies cannot participate in the program. It’s great the government removed big insurance’s PBMs from the negotiations and the result was lower prices for these prescription medications. That’s an important outcome for patients and taxpayers. But if almost no pharmacies can stock the drugs because they will sustain huge financial losses, the program will collapse before it even starts.”

According to the survey:

* 60.4 percent of independent pharmacists are considering not stocking one or more of the first 10 drugs listed in the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program.
* 32.8 percent of independent pharmacists have already decided not to stock one or more of the drugs listed in the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program.
* 96.5 percent of independent pharmacists said PBM and plan reimbursement for Medicare Part D threatened the viability of their business.
* 40.8 percent of independent pharmacists said they were paid below what they pay to buy the drug, approximated by the National Average Drug Acquisition Cost (NADAC), on more than 40 percent of the prescriptions they filled for Medicare Part D patients.
* 29.2 percent of independent pharmacists said they were paid below NADAC on 50 percent or more of the prescriptions they filled for Medicare Part D patients.
* 80.3 percent of independent pharmacists said the financial health of their business declined in 2024.
* 48.6 percent of independent pharmacists said the financial health of their business declined significantly in 2024.
* 30.3 percent of independent pharmacists said they are considering closing their business in Calendar Year 2025.

If CMS and the new administration want to save the program, and if they want to prevent the disappearance of many more pharmacies, they will make a number of changes, said NCPA.

Among the changes the organization proposed, CMS should bar PBMs from requiring pharmacies to participate in the program in order to serve Medicare Part D patients, and it must also give pharmacies the ability to cancel PBM contracts without cause. NCPA made many additional recommendations, [which can be viewed here](https://ncpa.org/sites/default/files/2025-01/1.27.2025-NCPA.comments.to_.CMS-PartD.Final_.pdf).
