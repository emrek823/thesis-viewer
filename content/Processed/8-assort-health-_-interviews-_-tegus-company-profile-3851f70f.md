**Client**
Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today about the voice AI industry. To start off, could you please give us a quick overview of your background and experience in this space?

**Expert**
Sure. Shared Practices Group, we do full arch dentistry only, so it's a specialized kind of dental offices. We are a dental chain of about 36 locations. Our phone calls are worth a lot because that's basically the most expensive or specialized procedure in dentistry. I was their vice president of strategy, so my job was to figure out once marketing handled the lead flow, so when a lead came in, how to convert as many as possible to show up to a consult, and then from consults to acceptance.

We started looking into Assort beginning of last year, and I was actually looking for an accent removal software. We have a call center here in the U.S., a remote call center, and we also had at the time an outsourced call center that we worked with an outsourcing company to set up. The outsourcing agent, the overseas agent, had a much lower conversion rate than our U.S. agent, and I was trying to figure out why. One of the hypothesis was the accent.

As I was searching for accent removal, I came across Assort on LinkedIn and realized that there were some conversational AIs. Now there's like 1,000 of them, but at the time, it was still something that not everyone knew. I looked into it and I thought this would actually solve our problem better than the accent removal, so that's how I got to it.

**Client**
Got it. Just to recap, you guys are like a DSO. Why is the phone call the most valuable thing? You led with that. Why specifically is that the most valuable thing?

**Expert**
Not in dentistry as a whole, but in our model when we only do full arch dentistry. Our average revenue per customer is $20,000, and we spend 10% of our budget on marketing. Every time that phone rings, it costed me over $1,200 just in marketing dollars for that call to come through, so not answering and not converting an appointment is detrimental. To us, we thought of ourselves as a sales organization that happened to be in dentistry, more so than a dental organization. That had to stop.

**Client**
Got it. You guys were using an outsourced call center in the U.S. to do a lot of this work for you?

**Expert**
Yes. We know we set up ourselves, and then also an overseas one.

**Client**
What pain points were you feeling there? How much were you spending with those guys before we get into Assort?

**Expert**
The pain points I was trying to solve is, one, our cost per call to answer the call between the U.S. agents and the overseas agents, plus software and so on, was $8 per call, $8 per call is unsustainable. As we scaled, that was going to be a big problem. The other problem I was trying to fix is, even with these call centers, our abandoned calls rate was at 12%. That means that somewhere between 10% and 20% of people hangs up before they get to someone. Out of those hang ups, 97% happened after the fourth ring. I had to figure out a way to answer that fourth ring no matter what.

The other problem I'm trying to fix is that my U.S. agents, they had a much higher conversion rate on the phone for new business opportunities, but they were only under 40% of their time answering calls that were new business opportunities. They were spending a lot of time answering phone calls that were existing patients calling to confirm appointments, to make a payment, all the admin work.

We call those low-value calls because we've already acquired a patient, they already signed up. Once they are your patient and you miss a call, they'll call you back. A high-value call would be a potential new patient opportunity, would be that person who hasn't come in yet and they saw your ad online, and they're calling you for the first time. That one is proven that you only have the chance that one time. If you don't answer, they move to the next person on Google. Our U.S. agents, which were our highest converting agents, we wanted them to spend more of their time answering high-value calls. That was the third problem we're trying to fix.

**Client**
Yes. You guys evaluated a bunch of vendors. How did you determine who was in the running on the short list? How do you differentiate what were the key buying factors?

**Expert**
Yes. I wouldn't say we looked at a ton of them. We looked at Hello Patient, Hyro. The other one had a really complicated name, I can't remember. Basically, every time we vet anything, whether it's software or services, our process is first, we come up with "What do we want?" and then we reach out and we try to skip their whole selling "Here's a demo," and their whole sales process, and we go right into our problems that we're solving.

We say, "Does your software fix this? They basically all said yes. Those questions were, "Are you able to answer the call 100% of the time by the four strings? Can you set that up?" The other question was, "Can you build or implement if you already have one, a phone number lookup?"

When a call comes in, it takes that phone number, it scans our database, and if it's a recognized number, it will tag that call as an existing patient, or what we deem as low-value call, and be able to set up a specific routing path for those calls. If the phone call comes in and it's an unrecognized number, then it's a potential new patient, so potentially a high-value call. We wanted to have a different routing, so you need to be able to have that feature. It's called a phone number lookup is what it's called.

The other question we asked was, "If the size of our account would be big enough for them to build any custom solutions in case we needed to." For that one, only Assort Health said yes. The other ones were like, "No. The product is a product, there is customization within the product. If there's something that you need to build just for you, we can't do that," which makes sense. This is, like I said, really, really early, and they haven't even finished building their own product. I just felt that we were going to have some specific needs that would be outside the box. It wouldn't be part of their product, which we ended up having. Those were the criteria.

When it comes to pricing, the way we do pricing is, we try not to make that part of the decision because again, we're spending over 10% of our revenue. It's pretty much impossible for anything we invest in to not give us an ROI because our average revenue per client is $20,000. We don't want to choose based on pricing, we want to choose the best. Once we choose the best, then we try to negotiate the pricing, but we don't compare their pricing so as to not.

**Client**
What made Assort stand out was primarily their ability to handle call volume, do patient lookup, do some call routing, and a willingness to customize the product over time?

**Expert**
Yes. The other thing, which isn't really a criteria, but what I liked about Assort is that they were very transparent when we were having these conversations. For example, they're like, "Look, we are brand new company so just know that the quality right off the bat is probably not going to be the way you want it. It takes time for the AI to learn." He also talked about the onboarding. He's like, "We don't even have to onboard." He's like, "I'm going to have to do it myself, the owner." I like that honesty. They made it clear that we would be one of their biggest client.

The other companies more treated us like we are just another client that they have. I feel like their sales rep kept saying yes to every question. I have worked in software before, and there's two trains of thought. One of which is say yes to anything they ask. I feel like that is what was happening. I trusted the answers from Assort a lot more than the answers from the other two.

**Client**
When did you guys officially start implementing these tools?

**Expert**
Yes. We always start with a pilot of 10 locations any solution we roll out. We did that in Q2 2024. It was the end of Q2, beginning of Q3. Now the onboarding we started in Q2, but we didn't go live until Q3. Again, that got back to them telling us that the onboarding will be clunky. That's the one thing I did not like about Assort. Even though to their credit, they told us it was going to be clunky.

**Client**
This was basically Q3 when you started onboarding with them?

**Expert**
It basically took 90 days to go pilot, which is ridiculous, but Q3 is when the pilot was basically live.

**Client**
Makes sense. Maybe tell me a bit more about the implementation process. It sounds like it was a little clunky. Where do things stand today, six months later, almost three quarters later?

**Expert**
The implementation process, they have to integrate with your phone system. We have RingCentral, so that took a while. They also have to integrate with your practice management system so they can schedule appointments and confirm appointments, and so on. They also have to improve the AI itself because like I said, in the beginning, it sounds bad. The only thing that improves it is more calls. After the pilot obtained locations, we felt really good about it.

Our patient population is usually 50 years old. The average age is 51, so it's older. We were really wondering how would an older demographic respond to a new technology, so we started a disclaimer once the AI picked up the call that said, "I am an AI agent. I can do this and this for you. If you still would like to speak to a human, just press nine." 15% of calls pressed nine, which was a lot lower than we expected.

The other thing too we had it so that, while it was existing on our new business opportunity, by the time it got to the fourth ring, the AI would enter it, so the 12% abandoned call rate that we had was solved. The phone lookup took a while to work. They were still sometimes finding a number. Instead of marking it as recognized, you would mark it as a potential new business opportunity. It took a while for it to be programmed right. Once it did, it's hard to measure that one because it was just a pilot of 10 locations. To see the real effect of that, we had to go system wide because the agents were still answering both types of calls for the other 26 locations.

We felt like we had seen enough to roll it out to all locations and Q4 of the last year is when for the whole quarter, all locations were on it. The phone lookup was working. Our U.S. agents were now answering 70% and 75% of their calls were new patient opportunities, where before it was 30%. They became a lot more utilized to what we needed them to, and that led to an increase in patients of 10% for new consults. 10% compared to Q4 the year before.

**Client**
Got it. Essentially, your approach was where it could take all existing patient volume and that way your human on the new patient volume, that's about converting.

**Expert**
Correct.

**Client**
You said, initially, that when it picks up and it claims that it's AI and then people opt or not. What is that rate trended now? You said only 15% said yes to the AI?

**Expert**
No, 50% said no to the AI, so 50% pressed nine to speak to a human.

**Client**
Got it. 85% opted into speaking with an AI agent?

**Expert**
Yes. They were okay with talking to the AI agent, which surprised us. We were expecting maybe 50/50. That was pretty good. Now the AI agent, again, it's answering all calls that get to the forefront. Sometimes a call would be a new patient opportunity, and those calls, the AI has a percent conversion rate when our humans are less than 80%. There's a huge difference there.

Now, I rather answer that call than miss it, so I'm still coming out on top. That just shows that the more human the call needs to be, the less effective AI is going to be because our new patient calls, sometimes they take 20 minutes. Sometimes the patient cries on the phone. There's a lot of empathy, there's a lot of emotions.

They usually have gone or talked to other dentists. We're rarely the first place they get called, so there are educated buyers. That's just way too complicated for the AI to convert. If they're calling and saying, "I'm calling to cancel my appointment," or "I'm calling to reschedule my appointment," that's an admin type of call and they can handle that.

**Client**
Got it. How are things priced today with Assort?

**Expert**
We pay over $600. We want predictability. I don't know if that's how they're doing with everyone else because again, we came in early and we were their biggest customer, so we had a lot of leverage. We said, "Look, we want predictability. We don't want fluctuations in invoices from month to month." We agreed on over $600 per location, and that gave us a bank of phone calls. I can't remember what the number is, but it was a specific number.

At the end of the quarter, if there was any overage, you would reconcile. Any calls that were over that bank of calls, we would a little under $10 per call for overage. We wrote them a check at the end of Q4 last year for about $10,000 to $15,000 so quite a lot of overage. Together we paid over $600 per location. That's about $40,000 a month, and then another $10,000 to $15,000 at the end of the quarter, and that gives you an idea of how much you spent for the quarter.

**Client**
Okay. That's really sizable amount. Basically, maybe a little more than half year.

**Expert**
Yes. We let go of all our overseas agents because once Assort was working, there was no need to have the overseas agent anymore, so about $30,000-$35,000 a month. We broke even with Assort.

**Client**
Of the revenue impact from being able to.

**Expert**
The revenue impact from the new consult went right to the bottom line.

**Client**
That's great. How long is the contract? What are you looking to get out of them or see from them in the next six to 12 months, and anything on product roadmap that they've talked about with you?

**Expert**
We want them to be able to take payments over the phone. About 18% of the calls that our existing patients are calling to make a payment. Right now, it transfer to the front desk. If they don't answer, they send an email, but then they have to call the patient and the workflow is broken and I don't see why the AI couldn't just say, "Read me your card number" and then process it.

They told us that that's on the roadmap. Sometime software companies, when they say it's on the roadmap, you do see it in, I don't know, two or three months. In some companies, they say that and three years later, they're still not delivered.

The other thing is, they have an analytics dashboard, but it only shows the AI performance. To me, I would like for that to be extended to all calls, whether it was answered by the AI or answered by a human because I'm paying another software to give me QA quality assurance on the human calls, and it's costing me over $2,000 a month, whereas the Assort one can do the same thing because it's already listening to the AI calls and giving QA metrics. Why not do it for all calls?

**Client**
Awesome. Just overall scale of 1-10, how likely are you to recommend Assort to someone else?

**Expert**
I'd would say nine just because I don't give 10.

**Client**
Got it. Thank you again for taking the time to speak with me today. Enjoy the rest of your day.
