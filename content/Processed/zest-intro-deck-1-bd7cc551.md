## Slide 9: Comprehensive Care

Comprehensive Care

**Address Complex, Chronic Care Needs**

| Sync with Your Health Coach Anytime | Track Practices that Improve Your Condition |
| :---------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------ |

**Mobile App Screenshot - Health Coach Call:**
*   Live video call with a health coach.

**Mobile App Screenshot - Diet Recommendations:**
*   **Diet**
*   **Foods to avoid**
    *   Psoriasis causes inflammation. Certain foods can cause inflammation as well. Avoiding those foods might help improve symptoms. These foods include:
        *   Red meat
        *   Refined sugar
        *   Highly processed foods
        *   Dairy products
        *   Alcohol
    *   Alcohol consumption can increase your risk of a flare-up. Cutting back or quitting entirely can help lower your risk. If you have alcohol use disorder, your doctor can help you create a treatment plan.

**Traditional Dermatology**
*   Undertrained on chronic care
*   Stress causes vicious flare cycle
*   Nutritional and psychosocial needs remain under-addressed

**Zest Platform**
*   Proactively addresses underlying causes of flares through better suited, lower cost health coaches
*   Focus on relationship-based care and engagement drives up LTV

## Slide 10: Coaching Addresses Gaps in Traditional Care

Comprehensive Care

Coaching Addresses Gaps in Traditional Care

*   Lifestyle risk factor management in happens in just 1% of derm visits for eczema or psoriasis
*   Rates of shared decision making (SDM) are below 10% in chronic derm visits
*   Patient adherence contributes to more than 40% of topical treatment failure

*   Targeted coaching increases rates of topical med adherence to more than 80%
*   Shared Decision making reduces rates of progression to aggressive treatment by 20-30%
*   Coaches are better trained and equipped to effectively provide adherence and SDM support

## Slide 11: Value-Based Care

Value-Based Care

**Capture Year-One Value for Risk-Bearers**

**Per Patient Annual Total Pharmacy Costs**

| Category         | Psoriasis  | Eczema  |
| :--------------- | :--------- | :------ |
| On Biologics     | $20,600    | $36,200 |
| Not On Biologics | $2,300     | $5,900  |
|                  | ~9x reduction | ~6x reduction |

**Reduction in biologics use in 100 patients saves $1.8M to $3.5M in Rx spend alone**

**Traditional Dermatology**
*   Low margins on chronic care incentivizes transactional care
*   Limited capture of value from cost savings or improved outcomes
*   Expensive billing overhead of >20%

**Zest Platform**
*   Incentivizes improved outcomes and reduced total cost of care
*   Empowers innovative care models
*   Limits cost and effort involved in billing optimization

## Slide 12: Zest Can Bend the Cost Curve Even in Worst-Case Scenario

Zest Can Bend the Cost Curve Even in Worst-Case Scenario

Financial breakeven achieved at 10% response rate, 6-8x below Phase III experience

**10x Reduction in Cost On Zest vs. Off**

|             | Systemic   | Topical    | PMPM     |
| :---------- | :--------- | :--------- | :------- |
| Cost/Month  | $6,000     | $1,000     | $100     |
| Duration    | 12mo       | 6mo        | 12mo     |
| Total Cost  | $72k       | $7.2k      |          |

= 10x Reduction in Costs¹

*   68% of patients prefer innovative topicals to biologics
