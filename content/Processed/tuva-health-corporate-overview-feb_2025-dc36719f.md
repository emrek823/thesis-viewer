## Slide 4: Problem

## Problem
Healthcare data teams waste
$1M+ annually wrestling with
fragmented, low-quality data

Healthcare data pain points:
1.  Multiple sources: Claims, EHR, HIE, Labs
2.  Multiple formats: CSV, JSON, XML, DB, PDF
3.  Persistent quality issues: Missing, invalid,
    duplicate, referential, implausible values
4.  Missing analytics-ready features

Result: Teams spend **80% of time** cleaning vs.
analyzing while wasting **$1M+ per year** in resources.

## Slide 5: Problem

## Problem
How do you go from 1 million+ codes to analytics-ready concepts?

| Input Codes | | Analytics-Ready Concepts |
| :---------- | :--- | :----------------------- |
| SNOMED-CT | | Care Settings |
| ICD-10 | | Provider Specialties |
| LOINC | | Services |
| NDC | | Conditions |
| RxNorm | | Procedures |
| HCPCS | | Encounters |
| Place of Service | | Episodes |
| Revenue Center | | Preventable Events |
| Bill Type | | Care Transitions |
| Etc... | | Etc... |

## Slide 6: Solution

## Solution
Tuva: An open-source platform that
transforms raw data into
analytics-ready insights

**Normalized**
Common schema unifies claims, EHR, HIE, and
lab data

**Quality-tested**
100+ automated atomic and analytic quality tests

**Enriched**
1000+ pre-built clinical concepts enrich raw
data for analytics

### Data Flow
1.  Raw data sources (servers)
2.  ↓
3.  Tuva Data Model (Tuva logo)
4.  ↓
5.  Advanced analytics (dashboard icon)

## Slide 7: Why Open-Source

## Why Open-Source
Open-source disrupts build vs. buy paradigm for healthcare data
platform customers

### Build
*   **Slow**: Can take years (we've spent 30,000+ hours building Tuva so far).
*   **Complex**: Internal teams struggle to hire and retain necessary domain experts to build internally.

### Hybrid
*   **Fast**: Go from raw claims and clinical data to advanced analytics in an afternoon.
*   **Full Control**: All code runs inside the customer's cloud, giving them full control of their data and the data model.
*   **Transparent**: Customer has access to all code, allowing them to reconcile to external reporting, which is critical for building trust in the data.

### Buy
*   **No Control**: Customer sends their data to vendor, limiting their ability to customize the data model for their unique needs.
*   **Black-box**: Customer has no access to underlying code, making it impossible to reconcile to external reporting.

### Competitors
*   innovaccer
*   Ursa Health
*   CEDAR GATE TECHNOLOGIES
*   Milliman
*   springbuk
*   ARCADIA

## Slide 10: Case Study

## Case Study
MultiCare is thrilled to adopt Tuva
for its speed, customization, and
transparency.

Why they are adopting Tuva:
*   **Speed**: Takes months to ingest and transform data into analytics on current platforms
*   **Control**: Current platforms have limited ability to customize data model to meet their needs
*   **Transparency**: Struggled to validate reporting and data quality due to lack of transparency of black box data models

## MultiCare
*   ~380k Members
*   ~$700k Year-1 Contract

"Tuva is a key investment
into MultiCare's ability
to succeed in VBC."

## Slide 11: Go To Market

## Go To Market
Open-source enables unique GTM motion by tapping into healthcare
data + analytics user base

### 1. Untapped User Base
Healthcare data and analytics engineers lack any sort of tools or community to support them – this is precisely who we are building for.

These individuals can access and use Tuva's open-source tools instantly, without signing a contract or BAA.

Our competitors build black-box solutions that cut-out the engineer rather than enable them.

### 2. Enterprise Adoption
Our users evangelize Tuva within their organization, leading the organization to adopt the open-source as their enterprise data model.

They start mapping all of their data sources into the Tuva Data Model, and build dashboards, reporting, and analytics on top of it, creating a huge dependency on the open-source.

### 3. Closed-Source Products
Eventually the organization runs into common problems the open-source doesn't solve, leading them to adopt our closed-source products to solve these challenges.

These are existing products in the market, however, customers will prefer Tuva versions of these products because they integrate seamlessly with the open-source and run inside the customer's cloud (no data needs to leave).

## Slide 12: Traction

## Traction
Our unique GTM motion is working and disrupting incumbents

### patina
The Patina data team loves Tuva. In early 2024 they adopted Tuva as their analytics data model for claims and clinical data, replacing a previous vendor in favor of building in-house. Since then they've made multiple important contributions to the open-source, especially in the areas of CMS-HCC risk scores, and are active members in the community.

### Care About HEALTH
Care About discovered Tuva in mid-2024 and quickly decided to replace Innovaccer with Tuva as their healthcare data platform. Key to Care About is the ability to customize the data model to meet their needs and the ability to have full control of and transparency into data pipelines. They are interested to add both EMPI and NCQA HEDIS Measures closed-source products when they are released.

### MultiCare
MultiCare discovered Tuva in Q1 2024 after deciding to sunset their existing data platform vendor. They immediately understood the open-source would accelerate their build by years. This quickly led to a large commercial partnership. We are now helping them implement the open-source as well as develop custom analytics on top of it. They have contracted to be an alpha customer for EMPI and are very interested in adopting other closed-source product like Benchmarking.

### waymark
The Waymark team discovered Tuva in early 2024 and immediately decided to adopt the data model. They now use Tuva to normalize their disparate claims feeds from MMCOs. At Waymark the Tuva Data Model is used by finance, actuary, and clinical teams for reporting and analytics. They have even published peer reviewed articles using the Tuva Data Model. Waymark is interested to add NCQA HEDIS Measures when they are released in Q2 2025.

## Slide 13: Vision

## Vision
Imagine the entire world's healthcare data in the exact same
analytics-ready data model

### Come for the tools,
stay for the network
Initially, users and organizations
adopt Tuva for the unique value it
unlocks for them.

However, as more and more
organizations adopt Tuva,
additional value is unlocked via
reusable and comparative
analytics.

### Reusable Analytics
As organizations publish research
studies and analyses on Tuva, the
code behind these studies is
completely reusable, i.e. it will run
on any Tuva dataset.

Imagine a future where the
average payer or provider can run
thousands of high-quality,
clinically-validated analyses on
their data out-of-the-box.

This unlocks insights that weren't
possible before, simply because
the payer or provider didn't have
the time to do the analysis from
scratch.

### Comparative Analytics
Beyond reusable code, payers and
providers can directly compare the
results of any analysis because the
underlying methods are identical.

This enables a learning healthcare
network, where payers and
providers can collaborate around
data to identify clinical best
practices.
