## Market Need

Fortune 2000 companies increasingly need to leverage healthcare data for mission-critical use cases:

LLM training

Personalized, Digital Healthcare Delivery

Med device distribution analysis

Ad attribution

Personalized ad targeting

Ad audience creation

Emergency room operations optimization

Pharmacy operations optimization

Patient recruitment for clinical trials

And more

To use this data, they must comply with the HIPAA Privacy Rule.

## Status Quo – Consulting-Driven Compliance

Today, the compliance process is slow, manual, and expensive. Most enterprises rely on consultants who:

Take months to process a single dataset

Charge $300k/project – $1M/dataset

Deliver compliance as a one-off service rather than a continuous capability

These delays erode data value, slow innovation, and inflate costs. In a world where data flows are now continuous, consultant-led models break — they can’t deliver compliance in hours or days, only in months.

## Solution – Integral

Integral is the compliant agentic data infrastructure for leveraging healthcare data. Our autonomous system:

Continuously ingests healthcare data from any source

Transforms it into the required compliant format

Certifies it for HIPAA and other regulations

Delivers production-quality datasets ready for immediate activation

Generates all regulatory paperwork alongside the data, unifying the data stack and compliance stack

Instead of relying on humans to manually manage risk, Integral’s agents operate continuously — assessing, remediating, and certifying datasets in real time. By making it seamless to activate compliant data, we capture existing HIPAA compliance spend and expand the total volume of compliant data in the market.

## TAM – The Spend We Replace & the Traffic We Grow

We target the dollars Fortune 2000 companies already spend to make healthcare data usable under HIPAA:

Total Core TAM: $15B – Spend already happening today, now addressable with a faster, cheaper, agentic system that runs without the overhead, latency, and cost of consultants.

## The Data Processing Flywheel

By making it dramatically easier to certify and activate compliant data:

More certifications →

More compliant data purchases →

More data flowing through our highway →

More platform revenue

We don’t just own the healthcare data superhighway — we increase the traffic on it.

## Why Now

Three converging forces make this the moment to build the agentic infrastructure for healthcare data:

Explosion of demand for AI-ready healthcare data – LLM training, clinical model development, and real-time analytics are driving unprecedented demand, especially for unstructured data.

Accelerating compliance complexity – HIPAA enforcement is increasing. States are rolling out their own privacy laws (CCPA, CPRA, etc.), making manual compliance even slower and riskier.

Consultant models can’t meet the demand curve – Data flows are now continuous, not one-off projects; consultants can’t deliver compliance in hours or days.

Enterprise urgency – Fortune 2000 companies see idle data as lost revenue and are prioritizing speed to insight.

## Vision

Integral begins by replacing the consulting market for HIPAA compliance and data engineering — where enterprises today rely on slow, manual, data and privacy projects. We turn that spend into real-time, reusable, automated infrastructure.

From there, our opportunity expands far beyond consulting displacement. Healthcare data is multi-modal and increasingly valuable across pharma, AI, retail, media, and employer benefits. Every Fortune 2000 company interacting with HIPAA-regulated data will need continuous, compliant infrastructure.

At the same time, enterprise systems are becoming agentic. Instead of waiting months for consultants, agents require compliant, production-grade data instantly. Integral is the superhighway they will rely on to transact safely.

We are not just automating compliance — we are building the default rails for enterprises to use healthcare data safely, confidently, and at scale.
