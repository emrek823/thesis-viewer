### Background: What is a Target Product Profile (TPP)?

Prudentia is taking a target product profile (TPP) built in excel, word, and powerpoint on bespoke and public datasets, and creating a software platform to quantify this process and leverage novel datasets - what Prudentia has termed an Integrated Product Profile (IPP). Prudentia talks about its Integrated Product Profile (IPP) to emphasize and communicate to customers a new way of working with TPPs with a software platform that is collaborative, quantifiable, dynamic, and pulls in novel data sources.

Target Product Profile (TPP): Every biopharma company uses a TPP in some way, shape or form. TPPs are not just an output or a format for a document that people have to follow, but the encapsulation and representation of the multi-step process that requires work from every team within a biopharma company to drive an asset through clinical development. A TPP helps answer the question (among many others) - what is the risk adjusted commercial potential of this drug in Ph II if this clinical trial is successful? TPP’s are a unique place for Prudentia to start because they are already utilized today as a core piece of the pharma value chain, a manual and inefficient process that teams typically pay consultants 7-figures for, done at the beginning of clinical development and impact all downstream decisions, and one of the few (if not only) areas where multiple BUs in pharma (clinical development, BD&L, regulatory, commercial, etc) already collaborate today.

Kymera Example for Current TPP: As a real-life example, Kymera ($2.7B market cap) had multiple assets in pre-IND or ph I stage. They engaged a consulting firm to plan where to invest $100s of millions to fund clinical development based on the commercial potential of each asset. Essentially, these TPPs are the result of multiple “what-if” scenarios based on historical clinical trials, current drugs in market, and early data on these assets that are used to project future commercial potential to justify further investment. This single PPT slide is a simple representation and summary for the sake of discussion, but there is a 100+ slide PPT deck that provides supporting information for this 1-slide overview. This process takes weeks to months and requires multiple groups from within sponsors and CROs.

To be more explicit about the groups involved, the data used, and the questions biopharma needs asked, here are some example analyses that drive these TPP outputs.

Current Treatment Paradigm: Analysis of current treatment guidelines (e.g., NCCN for oncology) from to understand the current treatment paradigm and epidemiology. This process current relies on stale public data from the web, paid subscriptions like UpToDate, and - one of the most error prone but still relied upon methods - primary research. Primary research involves calling prescribing physicians, presenting this simple and theoretical PPT slide, and asking how many patients they would prescribe it in today or 5 years.

Competitive Landscape: Analysis of current drugs on market (publications, investor presentations) and in late-stage pipeline (clincialtrials.gov) to understand potential market share for a pipeline asset. Often times, the TPP are slight iterations on standard of care (SOC) or hand-wavey extrapolations of early-stage clinical trial data. For example, the TPP above was essentially saying this new drug would be as efficacious as standard of care with better safety profile and dosing (less frequent).

Therapeutic Hypothesis: Preclinical data on an asset (internal data, publications/poster) that informs the therapeutic hypothesis as to why this drug can be differentiated.

Financial Projections: Bringing together all data sources to predict future revenue ramp and perform an NPV (or risk adjusted NPV analysis) using inaccurate industry benchmarks.

### Why Now?

Impending patent cliffs and loss of exclusivity (LOE) are driving increased M&A as big pharma increasingly relies on external innovation, while increasing clinical trial complexity is driving biopharma to bring commercial considerations earlier (pre-IND) in the clinical development process. Novartis is a canonical example of how biopharma companies are reacting to these trends in the pharma world of fast-followers. Prudentia can take advantage of these trends and serve biopharma customers with a software platform to replace bespoke consulting processes as data science sophistication increases in biopharma and increasing access to data internally pushes pharma to make use of data they already have.

Novartis as Leader in Industry of Fast-followers: Novartis hired an biotech equity analyst from Wall Street - Ronny Gal - to “help pick winners from internal and external pipelines…by push[ing] a target profile and understanding of what a particular molecule will do commercially, earlier in development.” While every biopharma might not have this same organizational structure (nor is it required for Prudentia to be successful) it’s a representation of how biopharma companies are looking to change their strategy to embrace the changing worldview Prudentia can enable.

Novartis New Organizational Model

Patent Cliff / LOE: Patent cliffs and exclusivity are inherent with the pharma business model, but the scale of that problem has never been higher, with >$200B of sales at-risk through 2028. The imminent loss of billions in revenue due to patent cliffs is creating urgency for pharmaceutical companies to replenish their pipelines. With internal R&D often insufficient to fill these gaps, companies are likely to increase M&A and BD activities to acquire new assets and technologies. 50% of the >$200B of at-risk revenue is in '27-28, which means now is the time pharma will start angling to replace these via high-conviction R&D & BD efforts. With the IRA, the "clock" for price negotiation starts at the time of initial launch, so companies are now incentivized to launch in the largest (1st line) setting upfront, as opposed to launching in a late-line setting with a lower bar for success & gradually working upwards.

M&A Activity: Big pharma deal sizes may be down, but the overall volume of M&A is tracking towards record levels. The preference for bolt-on acquisitions and de-risked assets continues, with a focus on oncology, immunology, and the rapidly growing cardio metabolism/obesity sector. This reflects the industry's strategy to mitigate risks associated with internal R&D while accessing innovative technologies and therapies to drive future growth. Even in the last few weeks, we’ve seen numerous examples (e.g., Novartis/Versant, BridgeBio JV) that represent the future of creative deal structures that biopharma companies want to employ, but struggle to do at scale today.

Increasing Trial Design and Complexity: No matter how you quantify it, clinical trials are becoming more complex. The past decade has seen many innovations in clinical trials, including new trial formats, novel endpoints, new biomarkers and ways of stratifying patients, a broader set of data sources such as real-world data and digital device data, and many others. New regulatory guidelines which impact the design of specific studies. Many sponsors need to conduct clinical trials across more countries and sites to facilitate competitive differentiation and market access. Sponsors are also under pressure to recruit patients faster and to manage costs. In parallel, trial timelines have increased and success rates remain stubbornly low.

Increasing Data Science Sophistication: Roche is spending $3B+ annually on digital infrastructure and Sanofi is transforming 2,000 TB of healthcare data / month. These companies and many more across the biopharma landscape continue to increase their sophistication and expand beyond niche business units. These organizations are adopting next-generation infrastructure to connect data within cross-functional teams - across different personas (data scientist, sales rep, marketing, researcher), internal organizations (finance, commercial, manufacturing) and data types.

Data Access → Data Utility: Biopharma is moving from a world of purely data access to a focus on transforming and leveraging this data to drive utility. Historically, biopharma companies relied on claims data (Komodo, Symphony, IQVIA, etc) to drive analyses mostly in the commercial setting. Over time, players like Datavant increased the linkage of different data assets (EMR, SDoH, genomics, claims, etc) for a variety of use cases for clinical development and commercial. At this point, most biopharma sponsors see claims data as commoditized and have already bought most of the EHR data they need (Roche acquiring Flatiron, BMS with Concert.AI, etc). Today, biopharma companies are looking for vendors and solutions that can help them leverage their current data assets to drive tangible business value - something that Prudentia directly solves with its approach.

### Norstella Comp

We use Norstella - a PE conglomerate of pharma data assets - as a “V1 market comp” to show how a subpar product and undifferentiated data assets can reach $500M+ in annual revenue to understand Prudentia’s path to $100M. Norstella and Prudentia do not compete directly and Prudentia can leverage Norstella’s data assets that pharma has already purchased in the near-term. We believe the biopharma platforms that win going forward will drive tangible business value built on top of these commoditized data assets. Claims data, analyst reports, and clinicaltrials.gov data are table stakes, and create new layers of value creation for the next-generation of data and analytics companies in pharma.

Norstella is a pharma data and analytics conglomerate with 5 legacy products that were built in the 1990’s and have been cobbled together by PE over the years. In 2023, Norstella did $533.3M in annual revenue (78% subscription revenue) with 78% gross margins. Welsh and management are projecting 15-20% growth over the next 2-3 years on top of this strong base. These product offerings are shockingly unsophisticated, built on top of undifferentiated data assets, and additional product development is extremely limited as WCAS drives EBITDA improvements for exit in the next 3-5 years.
