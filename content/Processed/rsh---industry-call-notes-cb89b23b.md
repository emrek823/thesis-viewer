"It's not much of a secret that a key to delivering higher quality and lower cost care in Medicaid is to meet members where they are. The reasons are many, but the point is that neither the incentives nor the environments for members or providers are conducive to changing behavior from anywhere except directly in front of the members and providers.”

“The problem has always been how to meet members at crossroads where we can influence care towards meaningfully higher quality and lower cost. "In-the-ambulance" triage by ER MDs is one of those critical crossroads because it can help redirect enormous volumes of unnecessary ED and inpatient care back to primary or ambulatory sites where it belongs for better patient care. RightSite works because it brings the right care (EMTs and RightSite trained telemed ER doctors and lay navigators) directly to the patients where they are - and when they are in need - before they are down an irreversible path of expensive and unnecessary care.”

“Because RightSite is a provider, Payers avoid the entanglement that would be involved in a delegated vendor engaged in emergent care. They can easily create no-risk value contract arrangements quickly and easily to help satisfy the ever-increasing value-based objectives in Medicaid.”

“We have tried literally everything else possible from the Payor and Provider side to change behavior in the avoidable ED space. Still, since none of those options could meet the members where they are with the right care, they had little to no impact. RightSite can change that for the benefit of its patients, my members, the hospitals, and the Medicaid program.”

#### 911 Response Liaison / EMS Ops Mgr. @ Non-profit EMS

“In EMS, going to the ER is not clinically necessary I’d say 80% of the time. That’s just my guess. A majority of these can be diverted to urgent care centers. The main barrier for not diverting were regulations. ET3 and all these protocols are coming online now which changes things for us.”

“At the end of the day, the system is going to collapse. There are going to be huge shortages and we are not being funded properly. We need a way to show the payers that we are adding value but we don’t have true partners today.’

“We tried community-based paramedicine but was unsuccessful b/c we couldn’t unlock reimbursement. That is changing with models like ET3. Outside reimbursement, the care management aspect was effective overall.”

“There are some states I would start in with this type of model. WA state has a great EMS system; Maryland (Prince William) has a great EMS system; FL has many counties funded by taxpayer (e.g. EMS is a public service) and attractive from lack of incentives between hospital-payers. Many others like that. Pick your battles.”

#### Former Chief Revenue Officer @ Landmark

"Having negotiated contracts for a decade now, perceived as both a provider and a vendor, what drug out the process and caused some consternation during the settlement process was the difficulty in clearly identifying value.

"The model at RightSite to identify and monetize value is both simple and paid in real-time, which Plans covet. There is no reason for dispute, no reason to drain actuarial or financial resources and it becomes predictable, which is key to understanding spend, closing books, and bidding on business. Additionally, the fact of the matter is that Medicaid members tend to use the ER as their preferred place for services, largely ignoring their assigned PCP. The RightSite model positively disrupts that behavior, providing higher quality, less costly care. Over time, the "frequent flyers" that flood the hospital ER rooms and overtake the ambulance system will learn to curb their behavior. These Plans pride themselves in benefitting their communities and will want to take credit for them."

#### Former EVP @ Aetna/CVS

"Non-emergent use of the ED has long been identified as a meaningful contributor to avoidable cost, fragmentation of care, and the resulting poor quality outcomes for patients in Medicaid, Medicare, and other publicly-funded healthcare programs. These adverse effects are most concentrated on the low-income, clinically- and socially-complex, and diverse populations. These realities, coupled with an emerging awareness of the impact of Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) on cost, quality, access, compliance, and the patient experience, have led government healthcare leaders and their contracted health plans to increase their focus on the reduction of avoidable ED use and to intensify their use of incentives for payors and providers to innovate and address this problem.

"These incentives are typically administered through quality programs and/or procurements and can take many forms, including: additional point values in competitive procurements; additional premium revenue; increased share of member assignment; or the opportunity to renew or expand contracts and service areas. Traditionally, payor initiatives to reduce non-emergent ED utilization have often been vendor-led and retrospective. They have frequently suffered from data latency and missed opportunities for real-time patient engagement. They have been a source of meaningful abrasion to the hospital and provider communities."

Health plans often only become aware of an "avoidable" ED visit once they receive a claim or an authorization request. That is typically followed by an expensive and laborious (for both payor and provider) review of claims and medical records to assess the "medical necessity" of the ED visit.

If the visit is ultimately deemed by a payor to be "non-emergent" (which is often the case), the payment to the facility and/or provider is reduced to a "triage fee" regardless of the services rendered or costs incurred. This process can also lead to a government-arbitrated appeals process that consumes additional time and resources. Much more importantly, while the claims review process is underway, health plan quality or care management teams will often attempt to locate and contact the patient to reconstruct the clinical and/or SDOH circumstances that led to the "avoidable" ED visit and to reduce the probability of reoccurrence. This approach is typically limited in its success for many social and logistical reasons.

The innovative RightSite model is designed to leverage technology and a unique provider model to overcome the structural defects in the traditional ED diversion models while improving the patient experience, reducing unnecessary expense and provider abrasion, and aligning with the policy goals of publicly funded programs. By combining the innovative telemedicine encounter with the on-site EMS provider to bring the physician-led and navigator supported triage to the at-home point of care, RightSite can identify potentially avoidable ED visits while empowering the patient to choose an alternative pathway or setting to address their underlying need.

With the physician-led triage being performed real-time under best practice protocols, the patient has peace of mind, the health plan can avoid redundant, expensive, abrasive, and labor intensive physician-led retrospective review of an ED claim, and the EMS service has the potential to redeploy their scarce resources to a more appropriate and higher-need patient. Simultaneously, RightSite's innovative Care Navigators can engage from the initial patient contact (with a 100% chance of engagement) to identify and address SDOH needs and to identify and eliminate barriers to appropriate care. The Navigators can also serve as extended members of a health plan's multi-disciplinary care team to address the patient's clinical or social needs and the often rigorous and time-bound compliance mandates of the publicly-funded managed care programs. The resulting reduction in avoidable ED encounters (and admissions, readmissions, etc.) will support the health plans' efforts to improve quality performance (e.g., HEDIS, STARS, etc.) and meet public policy goals of their government customers.

Additionally, RightSite's reimbursement that is funded by a portion of the savings realized from avoidable ED visits creates an immediate pathway to revenue (without additional expense to the payor) and aligns with the Medicaid and Medicare policy goals of increasing the use of value-based reimbursement. And, because RightSite is a "treating provider", the payments to RightSite are a medical claims expense and, unlike other UM- or vendor-focused solutions, do not consume the health plans' already limited SG&A resources."

#### CEO of EMS Start-up (MD)

“Saw firsthand that a lot of low acuity patients were entering the ED via EMS/911 calls that could’ve been more optimally diverted to primary / urgent care. Spent a lot of personal time in EMS ride alongs.”

“EMS agencies don’t have an incentive to participate today b/c their payment is based on how many transports they do. We developed payment so they have a stake in what we do. The idea came from Stellar Health’s model. They are trying to accelerate value for checklist items”

“We are seeing successful examples of this FFS to shared savings shift. EMS department in St Charles country that is doing something similar to EMS. They charged $750 that would cover the cost for the EMS and the provider group was being paid separately as a primary care encounter. Covers what they would have gotten anyway. This goes directly to the EMS agency - everything that they are doing, treating patients at the scene, transfer to alternative destinations.”

“Health systems are also struggling here. Capacity is 95%-103% all the time. Academic centers, EDs are always filled. Just looking at trends, the number of patients presenting to EDs is increasing rapidly. The number of diversion hours have been steadily increasing the last 2-3 years; means that bc so many patients are coming in through EMS hospitals simply cannot take in more patients.

#### EMS Director @ Health System (Participating in ET3)

“There isn’t a ton of data out there officially from CMS at the moment on whether ET3 is successful or not but at every program and conference I go to, people are very excited about early results. We (and most others that I see) have started over the last few years with targeted clinical areas. We started with hypoglycemia for example.”

“For more anecdotal evidence that I’ve seen, most patients have had a before/after change in ED admissions - typically a decrease. Patients like it bc often when they call they don’t exactly have an acute medical issue. Paramedics have found benefit because they feel like they’re benefiting the patient & their own agency. Hospitals are also happy because it increases their throughput.”

“We actually have separate community paramedics. People volunteer and get additional training b/c normal EMS training doesn’t get training for the community paramedic side. Some of the field providers have no interest in this. I want to respond to the car crash. Do the trauma work up and everything. I don’t want to sit in the living room and talk to the doctor. To get around this, it’s a pilot so we keep it modular. The agency makes sure that someone is designated as a medic on every shift.”

#### ED physician Focused on HaH @ Large AMC

“When thinking about this model, a few things come to mind initially….911 population that calls tends to have less of an existing relationship with the health system. So there’s the value in treating initial 911 encounters but really managing these relationships after in order to avoid subsequent, unnecessary 911 calls / ED admissions.

That’s the biggest thing we were testing out - longer term cost-savings beyond the initial 911 call. We were showing 1,3,7, and 30-day cost savings in some of our models. That gave us confidence that we weren’t just kicking the can further down the road”

“Also, how effectively this company can link up w/ community resources & how strong their SDOH resources/strategy is important given the patient population they are focusing on.”

#### CMO/SVP @ Large Health System

“We go pretty far upstream - home based services, HaH, community paramedicine. We have a home based service line to avoid acute care usage. We have "call us first" programs at a practice level. 911 we divert to community paramedicine, and the ED doc will do a telemedicine visit, we've been doing that for 5 years. We track ED per 1k usage and risk-adjusted ED rates, look @ patients & conditions that pop up, and also look at specific clinics.”

“We have put social workers in the ED, and in some ways it helps. About 2/3 of ppl in our community paramedicine program stay home, and we have two payer contracts that help pay for some of the services. It's something we want to grow. I don't know if I want to own ambulances, but the team wants to get more reliable response times. The response times have been a challenge as we are growing. We need to figure out how to scale this program.

“Sometimes patients can be transported to urgent care (ET3). I've looked at DocGo for this - scheduled acute in the home. At a set time every week, we're sending someone out. Someone who has the ability to prescribe. We're missing this piece (I've heard more on the West Coast). You need the triage for lower acute, like the worried well.”

“Disease specific as well. We want to make sure you are addressing behavioral health. Your comparative rate needs to be better than everyone else's - that helps you in value-based contracts. We have 1.6k patients in an RPM cardiovascular population, and it has helped. I look at it by disease states. With everyone taking more and more risk in Medicare, I'd love to figure that out. We have good signals in ppl with high cardiovascular risk.”

#### VP @ National Payer

“Right now, we are finally starting to realize after all these years that we have a huge staffing problem. About time. Both nurses and docs. If you think about just this enrollment period alone, we 2x the total capacity of risk-based primary care docs in all the groups that we work with. That is insane. We’re going to run out of docs before we run out patients for MA. With that, we are always thinking about how to unlock new supply.”

“ (in response to the RSH model) Brilliant, very elegant…We work with dispatch for scheduled urgent care in the home but that’s an entirely different model. I’d love to explore working with a model like this.”

“When I think about the 50% gainshare - again I’d have to go back and talk to more of the contracting folks - but around there is the target. Whether its 50/50 or 60/40 or some variation from that - I think that makes sense given how clean this model is”

#### CEO @ Regional MA Plan

“Average cost of avoidable ER is $3,400 based on Medicare avg. Based on my experience, I’d assume 60% of this for Medicaid. That will inform the economics of initial contracts with gainshare.”

“I’d be curious who the navigators would be in this scenario. HCW vs. LPN? That changes the equation. Also, how long will some of these visits last - especially for a frequent flier Medicaid population. How long do you need to be on the phone to get this stuff done? Including both the doctor and the navigator’s time when thinking about the entire episode.”

“What about liability? The #1 reason for getting sued is not going to ER — so what happens in the scenario where you do not go to ER but then get sued?”

“I don’t know the exact numbers here but you should understand different ownership structures. Volume driven by systems owned and/or affiliated ambulance companies vs true FD/county-owned ambulance services will have much different incentives.”

“It makes sense from the payer side. The limiter in this model is the ability to scale up relationships with EMS agencies. How do you engineer & ensure this alignment?”
