## Slide 2: Our Vision & Direction for Nitra Marketplace

Nitra's Marketplace transforms routine clinic spend into a **high-margin, data-rich engine**-
unlocking vertical integration across procurement, operations, and healthcare intelligence

*   **Current Stage**
    *   **Capture**
        *   Capture routine clinic spend via owned infrastructure- starting with 2.8% margin (card) and scaling to 25% (marketplace)
    *   **Control**
        *   Own the full purchasing experience to deepen margins and strengthen customer lock-in
    *   **Convert**
        *   Turn transactional data into proprietary insights that power analytics products for private and public health sectors

Nitra Marketplace is the compounding engine that starts with margin, builds control, and ends with monetizable data

## Slide 6: Nitra Marketplace

**Mckesson and Medline Partnerships**

*   Nitra has partnered with McKesson and Medline, two of the nation's leading distributors of medical supplies, to give Nitra customers access to over 500,000 SKUs across all healthcare specialties.
*   Medline and McKesson collectively offer the broadest catalogs in the industry spanning everything from general Med-Surg and exam room essentials to specialty supplies, equipment, and clinic-specific tools.
*   As two of the largest and most established distributors in healthcare, they bring deep purchasing power and volume-based pricing to ensure Nitra customers receive highly competitive rates across product categories.
*   With expansive distribution networks and strategically located warehouses, both partners offer reliable, next-day delivery in most markets—keeping clinics stocked and operations running smoothly.

## Slide 7: Nitra Rx Marketplace

**Aesthetic Offering**

*   With Galderma (Dysport), Merz (Xeomin), and Evolus (Jeuveau), our marketplace offers nearly full coverage of the most in-demand aesthetic neurotoxins—ensuring providers have access to the products their patients trust.
*   These three industry leaders are among the most recognized and trusted names in aesthetics, known for their consistent quality, clinical efficacy, and widespread brand loyalty across both providers and patients.
*   By consolidating offerings from Galderma, Merz, and Evolus, we simplify sourcing for practices—enabling efficient procurement of leading injectables through a single, trusted platform.

## Slide 8: Nitra Rx Marketplace

**Avastin Partnership**

*   Nitra has partnered with Turbare, a leading RX production and drug packaging company, to supply Avastin on the Nitra Rx Marketplace. Avastin is a retina injectable used to treat macular degeneration for ophthalmology retina practices.
*   As a widely used and cost-effective treatment, Avastin is one of the most frequently purchased drugs in the retina specialty space. On average, retina customers spend over $500,000 per year on this single drug.
*   Nitra anticipates acquiring 50+ retina practices over the next six months. By providing an alternative to traditional pharmaceutical suppliers, we are confident that this partnership will drive rapid expansion in the retina specialty space.

## Slide 9: Nitra Rx Marketplace

**GLP-1 Partnership**

*   Nitra has partnered with Revival-Care and Flex-Care, leading telehealth and GLP-1 providers, to offer a range of GLP-1 drugs to our Aesthetics and Medspa customers.

*   Our collaboration with Revival-Care enables customers without in-house physicians to access GLP-1 prescriptions for their patients through Revival's telehealth services.
*   Our product manufacturers are the former supplier of GLP-1 products to leading telehealth brands ForHims and ForHers. With clinics across the country scrambling to find reliable alternative suppliers, we see a significant opportunity to meet this growing demand with trusted fulfillment and strong upstream relationships.
