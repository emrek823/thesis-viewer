### Company Background and Market Position

- Tomaz Berisa: Former GenCOV founder/CEO (8 years, through Series A)
	- Computer science/electrical engineering PhD background
	- 3 years at New York Genome Center developing low-pass sequencing tech
	- Licensed technology and spun out GenCOV with VC funding
- Core insight from GenCOV experience
	- Sequencing costs plateauing due to human labor costs
	- Even with free sequencing, low-pass genome still costs $20-30
	- Need “fractions of pennies” to accelerate life sciences development
- Vision Language Action Models breakthrough
	- Physical Intelligence leading with open-source models
	- Tesla and Google Gemini developments
	- Enables telling robots “what to do” not “how to do it”

### Technology Approach and Go-to-Market Strategy

- Service lab wedge strategy
	- Starting with whole genome sequencing ($400 current market vs $100 reagent cost)
	- Interface customers already understand: samples/money in, data out
	- Rule: no touching lab equipment by hand, only through robots
- Target customer segments ($50-500k annual spend)
	- Biotechs, biobanks, pharma teams
	- Medium-sized academic labs and hospital research teams
	- Director-level decision makers who can approve $100-200k without escalation
- Market positioning vs competitors
	- Avoiding specialized vertical integration approach of others
	- Full lab automation rather than single-pod solutions
	- Building foundation for potential cloud lab model

### Current Status and Funding

- Team: Tomaz + co-founder Jahan (former GenCOV lab manager, 3+ years working relationship)
- Timeline: Left GenCOV May 2024, full-time since August
- Funding status
	- SAFE from SOSV (moved into NYC lab space 2 weeks ago)
	- $1.3M remaining to raise of $1.6M target
	- Robots arrived 1 week ago, currently training models
- Hiring plans: Data science engineer in Q1-Q2, potentially lab tech
- Revenue model: Amazon analogy - build service lab first, then expand tooling/platform

### Next Steps

- Virtue to provide feedback by end of week/early next week
- Key areas for conviction building: go-to-market strategy and customer wedge approach
- Tomaz available through end of year for follow-ups
