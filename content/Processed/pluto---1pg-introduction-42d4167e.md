## Introduction
Pluto is a specialty lender providing debt facilities to small and mid-size healthcare providers. Our target check size today is $250k - $5M. Our capital comes from a major strategic healthcare provider in the NY Metro Area. We combine institutional-grade underwriting with decades of operating expertise and a world-class Board of Directors including accomplished healthcare founders, executives, and investors.

## Where We Fit
Small and mid-size healthcare providers operate in a large, fragmented market that is difficult to navigate. There is a circular issue for providers in the lower middle market and the patient lives they are responsible for. Capital isn't flowing to these providers, and patients don't necessarily prioritize their health or follow routines. This combination makes it difficult to attract the best talent and prepare for the future. This perpetuates the circular problem, where lower representation leads to lower numbers of healthcare professionals supplying the needs of the population. Banks do not traditionally lend to these businesses, and even sophisticated private debt investors are hesitant to lend to smaller-scale providers.

## How We Are Different
Virtually all other lenders are purely financial – Pluto meets healthcare providers where they stand with value-added capital. Pluto combines institutional-grade credit underwriting with a deep industry and advisor bench and the backing of a NY Metro Area-based strategic healthcare operator serving 20,000+ patients daily. Pluto has an innate understanding of the unique challenges facing small-scale healthcare providers, something other lenders cannot match. Healthcare is our only focus.

5.  **Expert Insights.** Beyond the transaction, we and our strategic partners bring a wealth of industry expertise. Count on us to provide valuable insights that can potentially unlock new opportunities for your growth.
6.  **Collaborative Engagement.** Our commitment doesn't end once the transaction closes. We believe in forging lasting relationships. Post-transaction, we remain engaged, ready to assist and support your evolving business needs.
