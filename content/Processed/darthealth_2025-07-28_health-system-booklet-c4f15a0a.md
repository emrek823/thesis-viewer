**AI POWERED CLINICAL RECORD ANALYSIS**

**AN OVERVIEW**

**DartHealth.AI**

*   Malnutrition Detected
*   Analyzing clinical records
*   Missed High Risk Medication

## Page 2: THE PRESENT: LOSSES & LEAKAGE

Hospitals are being squeezed from every side—financially, clinically, and operationally—and it is leaving billions on the table:

*   **Margin crisis.** The median U.S. hospital operating margin hovered around 1% in late-2024, with labor and supply costs still above pre-pandemic baselines (kaufmanhall.com). More than 700 primarily rural facilities are now flagged as "at risk of closure” (axios.com).
*   **Revenue leakage.** Only about one-third of clinically malnourished inpatients receive the correct diagnosis code, forfeiting $7-10 k of DRG revenue per stay (pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, oig.hhs.gov).
*   **Penalty pressure.** CMS can withhold up to 3% of Medicare payments under the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program, and a single CHF or COPD readmission costs hospitals roughly $15k (cms.gov).
*   **Hidden chronic disease.** The CDC reports that 9 in 10 adults with Chronic Kidney Disease are undiagnosed, erasing $2-3k in RAF revenue per patient-year and delaying nephrology care (cdc.gov).
*   **Quality drag from uncontrolled diabetes.** Patients with an A1c > 9% drive an additional $8.8 k in medical cost per year (pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).
*   **Social-risk blind spots.** Less than 4% of claims carry a Z-code for Social Determinants of Health, leaving risk scores and grant eligibility untapped (cms.gov).
*   **Arms race for AI.** Top U.S. health systems publicly cite AI-based chart analysis as a 2024 strategic priority, signalling a market shift toward AI automation across the entire healthcare system (beckershospitalreview.com).

## Page 3: NOW YOU CAN CONFIDENTLY DEPLOY AI TO DELIVER BETTER CARE & GROW REVENUE

DART is the fastest-path from raw medical records to measurable wins:

*   **Plug-and-play:** AI engine that snaps into any EMR and with dozens of use cases—from denial mitigation to clinical-trial matching—without ripping out existing workflows.
*   **Customizability:** Activate new screening questions/prompts (oncology, Sepsis, peri-op, SDOH, trials, etc) in hours—not quarters—so the platform keeps expanding as your strategy evolves. Empower your SMEs, clinicians, and admins. No engineers required! See a spike in denials today? New trial sponsor? Deploy AI on day 2.
*   **Safety first:** SOC 2, systemic guardrails, audit-ready citations on every output.
*   **Accuracy that pays:** fine-tuned models + rule logic consistently hit >95% precision, driving 5-10× ROI.
*   **White-glove partnership:** Our forward-deployed clinicians and data engineers co-design modules with your teams, iterate weekly until the numbers move.

Bottom line: DART HEALTH is the safest, quickest, and highest-return way to embed AI across your entire care and revenue cycle—today and as your needs grow.

**How?**
We have a customizable NLP rule engine built on top of our Health Ontology. We allow users like Pop Health Analysts, Director of RCM, CMOs, and virtually anyone else in your organization to deploy screening rules for any use case—with high accuracy, ROI, and value. If you like to prompt, you'll love DART!

## Page 4: OUR DIFFERENCE

We don't just read charts – we understand them. Dart combines clinical intelligence with language models for usability at enterprise scale. You can combine your data analytics, CDI, compliance, and quality systems into one with Dart.

*   **Specialty-Calibrated Clinical AI**
    Easily tune models for specialty & use cases: cardiology, oncology, pediatrics, psych. Learns from your data, adapts to your clinical norms. Supporting the full care cycle from inpatient to outpatient.
*   **Cross-Referenced Reasoning**
    Synthesizes structured data (labs, meds) with unstructured notes (progress, H&P). Cross-analyze for inconsistencies, gaps, and duplications with clinical-grade precision
*   **High Accuracy, No Hallucination**
    Verifiable outputs, always linked back to the source text. Purpose-built LLMs outperform general models in health system settings
*   **Deployment-Ready, No Code Needed**
    *   Self-serve insights without needing to code or query databases
    *   Find documentation trends, coding variance, or population flags fast
    *   Empower quality and data teams with no-code tools
*   **Enterprise-Scale Intelligence & Managed Deployments**
    Fully managed deployment with specialist success managers. Analyze millions of records across facilities, timeframes, and care settings
*   **Learning & Fine-Tuned Models**
    Our system has learning capabilities & if needed, we can deploy custom models ad-hoc for your organization's use cases. Our team will take this on. For example, you can send us 100 Malnutrition Cases & our team will deploy a custom model within 4 weeks.

Real-time dashboards, customizable exports, and audit-ready logs. A truly easy to use platform to review data & extract insights.
