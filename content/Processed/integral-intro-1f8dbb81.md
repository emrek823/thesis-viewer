The Why: The Explosion of Data and Regulation

Since 2020, the digital shift due to COVID-19 has led to an explosion in consumer data collection. People now regularly share their data across various platforms—health apps, telemedicine services, financial apps, and websites. The scale of data collection has drawn the attention of regulatory authorities. And with the rise of AI models consuming vast amounts of this data, regulations are tightening. Biden's AI executive order has set guidelines for AI models and their training data, while existing regulations like HIPAA and CCPA are being updated. In 2023 alone, four new state privacy laws were enacted, making a total of 20 states with specific data regulations that need to be taken into account.

Problem: Regulatory Hurdles Block ROI on data purchases, models, and analysis

As data collection becomes commoditized, the focus on its usage increases. Updated and new regulations impact various data types—financial, social media, geographic, medical, and more. Companies spend billions on these datasets but face significant delays, taking 12+ weeks to make the data usable. They rely on consulting firms like Deloitte for risk analysis and compliance, but this manual, slow, and inflexible process often devalues the data. Implementation of data changes further delays the process, causing companies to make poorly informed decisions, impacting advertising, inventory, and research.

Solution V1 - Static Regulated Data Enablement (Nov ‘22 - Mar ‘24)

Integral ingests a set of non compliant data, detects embedded regulatory risk, implements solutions, and outputs a compliant, high quality set of data. We worked with leading companies as design partners and early customers to ensure robust product development.

Solution V2 - Real time, continuous regulated data delivery (Mar’24 - Now)

Integral picks up non-compliant data from a source, aligns it to relevant regulatory requirements, and continuously delivers compliant data to a user specified destination. Users can specify cadences of pickup and delivery (daily, monthly, quarterly, etc).

Why Us - Earned Insights, Industry Recruited Team

We built large scale regulated data processing systems at LiveRamp and they consistently broke due to non compliant or badly transformed data inputs. We worked directly with Deloitte and others to lead regulatory data reviews for the top pharma, payers, CPGs, and others. So we left to automate our jobs and create a new data infrastructure. Then we recruited a team with experience building and selling data processing software at Salesforce, Datavant, Flatiron, Trilliant Health, and Aetion, and key members who helped shape the regulations we automate.
