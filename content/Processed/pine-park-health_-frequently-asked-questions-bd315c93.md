## Growth

* See SLIDE
* Which assisted living facilities are you working with?
    * See SLIDE
    * We are working with three of ten of the largest ALF management groups, including Brookdale, Sunrise, and Pacifica. We are contracting with every large management company with a presence in the Bay Area.
* You launched the first clinic last year. How come you only have 132 patients?
    * We are starting to count saturation in most communities in January 2021.
    * We spent most of 2020 scaling up COVID19 testing in the Bay Area.
        * February 2020: We opened our first clinic.
        * March-October 2020: we pivoted to provide COVID19 testing to ALFs in the Bay Area.
            * We scaled COVID19 testing to over 50 facilities in 4 months; at our peak we were serving 50+ ALFs and doing over 13K tests a month.
        * January 2021, we formally re-launched our primary care model.
        * Our testing efforts allowed us to build relationships with the cluster of facilities we are now serving.
    * Note: for us to get to pre-IPO revenue targets, we only need to recruit ~20-30K patients.
    * We are on track to get to 700 patents by the end of the year.
* How fast are you growing in facilities now? Do you have the breakdown of growth by cohorts?
    * See CHART
    * We acquired a little over 45% of all eligible patients during the first 6 months after we opened enrollment.
    * We will acquire:
        * 5% of the eligible residents in the 1st month,
        * 40% in the 6th month and
        * 70% by the 12th month.
* How does your enrollment process look like now?
    1. We work with facility staff to build and score a list of resident leads
    2. We carry out on-site events, placements, and meet and greets
    3. We nurture champions at the facility
    4. These champions then recommend Pine Park Health to residents
    5. We run nurture campaigns that include email, paper, and in-person touchpoints
    6. Finally, we drive enrollment through our targeted campaigns for new resident facility move-ins
* How attached are patients to their PCPs?
    * 40% of residents who decline to sign up after the first meeting said they already have a PCP
    * Of these, we will convert 30%-50% in the following 4-12 months.
    * Note: don't have a PCP
* What is the saturation in the first clinic that you opened?
    * 78% saturation at Elder Ashram in Oakland, CA
    * Note: the facility would not have been qualified for Pine Park Health today as it is too small.
* Do patients need to choose you as their PCP? If yes, how do you transition patients?
    * Yes. More than 40% of all eligible residents will convert during the first 5 months to become PPH patients.
        * We win patients by offering 1) on-site diagnostics 2) urgent care services and 3) less frequent visits that fill gaps in care from their legacy PCP.
        * These patients then voluntarily align with Pine Park Health for primary care.
        * Within 5 months of the kickoff, residents will change their PCP to a PPH PCP and the facilities will submit the change on their residents’ binders.
        * When a patient joins our practice, we work to gather their health history through records requests, an Initial Health Assessment (IHA) visit with the patient (and their family over video). We then develop a personalized care plan for the patient.
* What are the commercial relations that you have with the facility?
    * Pine Park’s primary relationship is with the patient, not the facility.
    * We often sign an "Onsite Primary Care Agreement" with the facility. This document grants access to the space and covers the normal liability and compliance issues.
    * Because ALFs are not medical facilities, they are not allowed to play a role in clinical care delivery (or payment for those clinical services).
* How do patients react to NPs as PCP? Are they more hesitant to attribute themselves to these NPs?
    * No. Our team-based approach includes an MD, NP, and Care Navigator that all participate in providing high-quality clinical care. Residents and families understand and align with the model.
* How many patients do you project to have per facility?
    * 20-30 on average depending on size and geography.
* Are you planning to work with brokers to encourage patients to switch plans?
    * Yes. The nature and extent of this work will depend on our evolving path to risk with different carriers (and with CMS) in different markets.

## Introduction

* What is Pine Park Health?
    * Pine Park Health opens onsite-clinics in assisted living facilities and uses technology to keep residents healthy.
    * We establish a space in a facility, hire doctors/nurses to staff it, and provide preventative care to keep residents away from hospitals.
* Why are you raising your Series B now? Why not in a year?
    * Over the past 6 months, we validated the following hypotheses
        * Growth into new facilities: 8 ALFs in Q1 → 25 ALFs in Q2.
        * Growth within a facility: 5% → 40% of eligible patients are our patients.
        * Low CAC: $400-500 CAC
        * Our patients have high risk-scores (RAF = 1.8-2.0).
        * Our model requires scale to reach global risk; we require capital now to execute on that roadmap.
* What is the problem that you are solving?
    * Assisted Living Facilities (ALFs) now have high acuity residents they cannot care for.
        * Residents in assisted living today are as sick as residents living in SNF ten years ago; they suffer from multiple comorbidities, behavioral issues, and memory impairments.
    * The problem: There are no doctors/nurses / clinical staff in ALFs. ALFs are real-estate businesses; they provide no clinical care. And now residents' health needs outpace ALF's services. These residents must go to the hospital every time they have an emergency.
    * The Stakes: As the acuity of residents grows, facilities will become over-dependent on 911 calls. And without on-site clinical care, these facilities will no longer be able to function.
    * In recent months, this trend has been exacerbated due to COVID19. Since current residents are waiting longer to enter facilities, they tend to be older and sicker than past cohorts. As a result, facilities are now struggling more than ever to hold on to residents.
* Can you describe to me how ALF residents get medical care today?
    * Residents get care today in two primary ways:
        * They get sent to the hospital (following a facility 911 call)
        * They drive to a PCP outside of the community every 3 months for a check-in.
        * Some high-end communities offers concierge physician services that residents would need to pay extra for.
* How are you solving this problem?
    * Our model.
* Why now? Why has no one else done that before?
    * Global Risk contracts now make onsite care economically viable.
        * CMS is now actively encouraging providers to enter into at-risk programs (e.g., CMS’s PCF and DCE programs) to deal with the growing healthcare spending.
        * Medicare Advantage insurers have seen proof points from Oak and others and now offer value-based partnership models for primary care groups. These models can (1) help grow their MA membership and (2) manage cost, quality, and risk within their patient panels. In several cases, MA carriers are investing directly in primary care groups that can deliver on these goals.
* Why can't facilities offer medical care?
    * ALFs cannot bill insurance, and therefore cannot hire physicians.
    * These ALFs are running as hospitality / real-estate businesses which prevent them from assuming liabilities for health outcomes.

## ALFs

* How many ALFs are there in the US? Which ones are you targeting?
    * There are about 30,000 AL / RCFEs in the U.S. (excluding SNFs).
    * We focus on facilities with 50 or more licensed beds/units.
* What is the average size of an ALFs? What is the distribution of large facilities (over 100) and small ones (less than 50)?
    * About two-thirds of the ALF population lives in a facility with 50+ licensed beds, and that is our target market."
    * The average size of an ALF in our target segment is ~100 beds.
    * In the industry as a whole:
        * 40-50% of all beds are in facilities with 100+ beds, and another
        * ~25% of all beds are in facilities with 50 - 99 licensed beds.
        * ~30% of beds are in small facilities (<50 beds)
* Are you targeting SNFs?
    * No.
* Are you targeting ILs and CCRCs?
    * Yes.
* How many facilities does the average management company operate?
    * About 40 facilities and 4,000 - 5,000 licensed beds/units.
* How many ALFs do you need to recruit per market? What % of the market share is it?
    * 25-50
    * This will vary substantially based on the local market because the local facility size mix differs and our unit economics depend primarily on the number of patients we serve in a given market, and only secondarily on the number of facilities.
* Can you walk me through the funnel? How many facilities per market will you engage in? How many of them will have enough eligible residents? How many of these residents will you be able to recruit? How many of these residents will you be able to move to at-risk?
    * Per market, we will engage with 50-150 facilities.
        * These facilities all have more than 50 beds.
    * Many of these facilities will come through direct outreach or existing relationships with management companies.
    * We see a 40-60% win rate among qualified facilities.
    * We recruit 40-50% of eligible residents within the first six months (in line with performance in our current facilities).
        * This number will rise to 70% over a 12-month period.
    * In a given metro market, then, we might sign up 30 - 50 facilities over our first year of local operations, and build to a panel of 1,000 - 2,000 patients 24 months after entering that market.
    * By 2025, we expect that we will be able to attach global risk to 70% of our patient panel.

## Residents

* How many eligible residents do you have per facility? What makes residents qualified?
    * ~40 eligible residents per facility in the Bay Area.
    * 60 - 90 / facility eligible residents outside the Bay Area.
    * We expect the Bay Area number to rise to 50 - 60 eligible residents by the end of 2021.
    * Eligibility is primarily driven by whether Pine Park can accept the resident's current health plan.
* How many of your residents are on traditional Medicare? How many are on Medicare Advantage plans? What is the distribution of your current patients by the plan?
    * In general, we see a similar payer mix in assisted living facilities as in the surrounding counties.
    * In the Bay Area, a typical mix would be:
        * 40-50% on traditional Medicare,
        * ~40% on Kaiser, and
        * 10% - 20% on other Medicare Advantage plans.
        * Note: Kaiser patients are not eligible
        * Note: Until May, we were an out-of-network choice for all other MA insurers. We have since signed contracts with Aetna, Humana, and Blue Shield of California, and expect to complete several more insurer contracts in Q3.
    * Consequently, ~90% of our current patients (as of 6/30/2021) are on traditional Medicare, though we have started to see sign-ups from Aetna members, etc as we became an in-network option for those residents. As we expand into San Mateo and Santa Clara counties, we will see a modestly lower Kaiser presence (~30% of ALF residents), and more residents on other MA plans and this mix shift will continue as we expand into Southern California and other states. In general, we will continue to see 40-50% of residents on traditional Medicare in most metro markets in California and neighboring states (AZ, NV, etc).
* What is the level of the disease severity of ALF residents? Are there residents that are "too sick" for you?
    * The average assisted living resident is 84 - 87 years years old (including IL, AL, and MC), as compared to 73-74 years for the average Medicare enrollee, and ALF residents also skew female (60 - 70%).
    * The prevalence of most chronic conditions is materially higher in ALF residents than in the Medicare population in large - 80% of ALF residents have documented hypertension and hyperlipidemia, for example, 50% have ischemic heart disease, and more than a third have some form of diagnosed dementia.
    * There are no ALF residents that are “too sick” for Pine Park, though we generally would not recruit patients who are already on hospice. This is not a significant percentage of eligible ALF residents.
* What is the average length of stay of a resident?
    * 4 years.
    * Our patients' average length of stay in facilities is four years. By this metric, the length of stay will vary by market but is generally in the range of 3 - 5 years for independent living, 2 - 3 years in assisted living, and 1 - 2.5 years in memory care.
    * The length of stay of residents living in chain-owned ALFs - Sunrise, Brookdale, etc. - is longer than residents living in independent residential care homes (ALFs with less than 20 beds which we don't target). The multiple levels of care in chain-owned ALFS allow for a longer relationship with Pine Park Health (4 years).
* Are you becoming the residents' PCP?
    * Yes.
* How do you know that your patients will be attributed to you? What if they still see their current PC provider outside of the facility?
    * Pine Park patients already sign enrollment forms when they choose Pine Park, and we will include “voluntary alignment” forms in this packet, as needed for each risk program or payer contract.
    * Our onsite presence and relationships with facility staff also position us well to be the "first call” when a patient has an issue. Depending on the details of each risk program, a patient's visit to a non-Pine Park PCP would either be counted as part of the total cost of care, like any other medical service or would be deducted from a primary care capitation payment.
    * Note: Patient attribution to a PCP varies by the payer and CMS program, but relies either on voluntary patient choice (i.e. patient designates a PCP by signing a form or identifying that doctor via MyMedicare.gov) or by retrospective claims analysis, in which the patient is attributed to the PCP who delivered a plurality of primary care services during a given period of time.

## Markets

* How will you choose your next markets? What is the new market evaluation framework?
    * We will prioritize markets based on three primary variables:
        * The density of assisted living facilities that fit our care model
        * Local payer mix - i.e. the likely % of local ALF residents who will be eligible for Pine Park, and whether a given market will help Pine Park build or expand panels of a particular MA carrier’s members
        * Existing relationships with ALF chains/management companies and payers, which accelerate local facility growth or shorten the path to global risk in that market
* Are there markets that you cannot serve? Why?
    * Yes. Under our current, ALF-focused model, there are markets that are simply too small to support the fixed costs of a local team.
* Why did you choose the Bay Area as your first market?
    * We chose the Bay Area as our first market because the team that develops the product and services is based here. We believe that to build a new care-delivery model and products our leaders need to be as close to our patients as possible.
    * After we develop the initial set of playbooks and tools (the end of Q3), we will venture into new markets and create new teams.
* When are you planning to venture into new markets?
    * We plan to move into 1 new market in Q4 of 2021, and 2 new markets in 2022.
* What kinds of regulatory barriers do you expect to meet in new markets?
    * Proper set-up of a local medical group / professional corporation, consistent with that state's corporate practice of medicine laws
    * Allowable scope of practice for nurse practitioners (and/or any limits on physician oversight of NPs & PAs)
    * Licensure/approval of risk-bearing provider entities (e.g. "Delegated Entities" in Texas or "Risk-bearing organizations” in Massachusetts)
    * Note: We expect the regulatory barriers in most new markets to be lower than those present in California
* What is your strategy for getting the Restricted Knox Keene License?
    * Medical groups in California can take professional risk as a “risk-bearing organization" (RBO), which is a much lower hurdle than an RKK license
    * Note: CMS programs such as Direct Contracting are exempt from the RKK requirement, and there may be options for Pine Park to participate in MA risk arrangements that do not require an RKK license, by working within a certain payer contract models or partnering with IPAs that already have an RKK license.
* What happens after you exhaust the initial TAM of ALF residents? How will you continue to grow?
    * In 2024 we plan to open up our micro-clinics to residents living outside the facility. Our vision is to serve all adults on medicare from small, distributed medical centers in facilities. This model would allow us to create a funnel where high-acuity residents can move into the facility, and low-acuity residents can still get care via clinic visits.

## Business Model

* What are your main assumptions on Revenue, CAC, and Medical Claims Expense Ratio? Why do you estimate your revenue will be better? Why do you estimate CAC will be better? Why do you estimate you will have a better MLR? What kind of evidence do you have to prove that?
    * HERE is our comparison to benchmarks.
* What do you expect the average PMPM to be under at-risk agreements?
    * $1,737
* What do you expect the average FFS PMPM to be?
    * $168
* How many patients / ALF do you need to break even?
    * 12 patients. Per micro-clinic, the lifetime value of 12 patients is greater than all per-facility clinic standup costs + it breaks even on our labor investment.
* How long will residents stay with PPH patients? What is the patient's LTV?
    * We anticipate 25% yearly churn and an average tenure of 4 years. The LTV per patient is $7,594.
* If residents' length of stay is less than four years and patients become profitable only after year 1 or 2, will you make enough money?
    * We expect to reduce patients' medical claim expense ratio to 70% in year 1 or 2. This fact would allow us to achieve profitable medical claims expense ratios for years 2 to year 4.
    * Note: since the costs of acquiring a patient in a mature clinic are minor, we expect the CAC: LTV ratio to remain strong through the lifecycle of every clinic.
* How does the clinic unit economics work and evolve? How much do you need to invest in standing up a clinic? Where does this money go?

* How fast do you expect to get the medical claim expense ratio down enough for you to make money?
    * For 2025 patients: 95% in year 1, 70% in year 2, 60% in years 3 and 4.
* How much does it cost you to acquire a patient?
    * $438
* How much does it cost you to open a micro-clinic?
    * See Slide
    * Facility Acquisition Cost= $36K;
* Will you be breaking even on FFS patients? What is your margin?
    * No, -47%
* What would be your care costs per patient?
    * $246 PMPM
* How much are you paying to lease a space in an ALF?
    * 5% of our facilities require a lease at an average of $400 per month.
* What percent of revenue do you expect to come from at-risk contracts?
    * 96%
* What do you expect your Medical Claim Expense Ratio to be for mature patients?
    * 60% from year 3 onwards
* What is the current proxy-medicare-claims-expense-ratio-metrics you are measuring?
    * Emergency Department Visits and hospitalizations
    * Percent deceased on hospice
    * Specialist referrals.
* How did you calculate the 95% medical claim expense ratio in year 1?
    * For the average Medicare patient, primary care spending accounts for ~5% of total costs. Accordingly, if Pine Park takes over primary care services for a given patient while receiving a global capitation payment which is roughly comparable to the prior year's total costs, we would expect ~95% of that capitation payment to be spent on external (non-primary care) claims, before any impact from managed care tools or utilization that we can avoid through our onsite presence or more effective care management.
* Won't you lose a bunch of money on more FFS Medicare patients?
    * We do expect to operate at a loss on pure FFS Medicare patients until we can transition them to a risk arrangement.
    * Given the nature of our (heavily polychronic) patients and the advent of new CMS payment models, we expect these losses to be narrower than those experienced by Oak Street in its first 5-6 years of growth.
    * As a comparison, Oak's average patient is roughly 14-15 years younger than the average Pine Park patient (per the Oak S-1). In 2018, when Oak had ~20,000 FFS Medicare patients under management, they realized only $11 PMPM in Chronic Care Management revenue on their FFS patients, suggesting that these CCM codes were only appropriate and billed for 10-20% of their patients at that time. Oak appears to have since increased its CCM revenue to >$60 PMPM. We believe that CCM is appropriate for nearly all Pine Park patients, though we have assumed it will ultimately be billed for only 70% of patients, and so generate a roughly comparable level of panel-wide PMPM revenue to what Oak reported in 2020.
    * Primary Care First creates an additional alternative for Pine Park’s original Medicare patients. The Primary Care First capitation payment for a panel with a risk score of 2.0 is $175 PMPM, with an additional flat fee for patient visits. CMS has estimated that the total revenue to Primary Care First providers with such high-risk panels would be $212 PMPM, before shared savings; this would be roughly 3x the total PMPM revenue Oak Street generated on its original/FFS Medicare patients in 2020. Pine Park has applied for the Primary Care First program, as an intermediary step on the path to global risk, and as a way to align our financial model with a value-based approach to care as quickly as possible.

## Contracting

* How many patients do you have under risk agreements now? If none, When will you start attaching patients to global risk contracts?
    * We do not have any patients under global risk agreements now. Our financial plan assumes that we can start attaching patients to global risk contracts in 2023.
* How many patients do you need a per plan to assume global risk?
    * This will vary by plan and program but is likely to be in the range of 250 - 2,000 patients.
* Why are you not going full-risk sooner?
    * Assuming global risk without the scale and tools to manage those patients could produce large losses and/or greatly increase the capital required to build Pine Park
    * For actuarial reasons, some payers only contract on a calendar year basis, with a 3-6 month lead time, and CMS programs also operate on a similar cycle. In these cases, the panel we build over the next 6 - 12 months would be available for global risk attachment only in 2023.
* Will you need to enter into contracts with plans in every new market? Or will these contracts be national?
    * This will vary by insurer. In most cases, we will be able to negotiate template contracts at a national level, which can then be applied in specific states or markets.
* If most of your patients are on traditional Medicare, how will you enter risk contracts?
    * For patients on traditional Medicare, we have two options to attach global risk:
        * Switch those patients to an MA plan where we have a global risk arrangement
        * Align those patients to a CMS risk program, such as a Direct Contracting Entity
    * Note: As of June, our current patient panel is predominantly on traditional Medicare, as Pine Park was out of network for all MA plans until May. We're now in-network for three MA carriers, and will add more in Q3. Over time, we expect our addressable ALF patient population to broadly track the payer mix in the local market. 30 - 50% of ALF residents will be on MA plans, depending on the market.
* Within the facilities you are operating in, are there 1,000 or more patients from any MA payor (e.g., could you get to a capitated contract with your current footprint)? If not, how many more facilities do you need to add before it is plausible that you could achieve patient panel sizes that enable capitation?
    * Our current facility partners have ~3,200 total licensed beds, and there is no MA carrier with >1,000 patients in this group of facilities. The number of new facilities we need to add to build threshold panels will vary tremendously based on the new markets we enter, which is why the payer mix is a significant factor in market selection.
* If you don't have more than 1,000 or more patients from any one MA payor in the Bay Area, will you never be able to assume risk in the Bay Area?
    * There are ~160 assisted living facilities in the seven-county Bay Area with 50 or more beds; we expect to meet the 250-500 threshold that we will need to assume risks for those patients.
* Are there any payers that cannot work with you? Why?
    * No.
* Are plans interested in these patients at all? E.g., Many payers avoid dialysis patients because they are costly. What makes payers want to add ALF patients to their model?
    * Insurers are investing heavily in home-based primary care and other care delivery models that can help avoid costly episodes of inpatient care or improve longitudinal management of the chronically ill; Pine Park fits squarely into this approach.
        * Industry-wide, the insurer profit margin on Medicare Advantage plans for patients who need an institutional level of care (I-SNP plans) is more than twice the margin on the average MA plan.
        * Because patients are eligible for special enrollment periods when they move into an ALF, Pine Park can be a source of member growth for MA plans, even outside of the annual open enrollment period.
* How are you planning to switch residents?
    * We will message residents, and work with them to switch their insurance during Special Enrollment Periods (e.g. when a resident moves into a facility that is outside of their plan's service area) and the annual Open Enrollment Period.
    * We will operate within the bounds of Medicare plan marketing guidelines; sharing educational materials, plan comparisons, navigation support on medicare.gov's plan finder, onsite events, and introductions to licensed brokers.
* Do you want to be ACO at some point?
    * We are exploring multiple CMS value-based payment programs to assume risk on traditional Medicare enrollees, over different time horizons. On our current assessment, the global capitation track in Direct Contracting appears to offer the model best-suited to Pine Park in the medium term, with some structural advantages relative to Medicare Shared Savings Program ACOs. However, both programs are evolving, and we will re-evaluate all available CMS risk arrangements in early 2022.
* Will your agreement with plans be the same?
    * All of our agreements would include a structured to global risk. At the same time, deals with plans will vary. We expect a set of common elements - such as a focus on hospitalization costs and certain HEDIS measures that are relevant to an elderly population.
* Why are you not acquiring more practices to get to at-risk sooner?
    * We are actively considering practice acquisitions to accelerate growth and enter new markets. We have begun building relationships with some potential target PCPs who already serve ALF residents. However, inorganic growth will necessarily be fairly selective, given our particular focus on elderly residents in ALFs and other senior living facilities.
* Have you thought about preferred relationships or rates with health systems/specialists/etc. ? (downstream from you all costs)? In a very different segment, One Medical is making money in these relationships (and supposedly getting a better patient experience)
    * Short term, there are scenarios where Pine Park will be paid higher FFS rates by risk-bearing IPAs, because of primary care's importance to the overall cost and quality management under their payer contracts.
    * Long-term, we will negotiate financial partnerships with specialists and/or hospital systems, to share risk, create downstream incentives for value-oriented patient management, or secure lower-priced services for patients under global risk arrangements.
    * One Medical uses hospital/health system relationships to increase healthcare expenditures, by billing primary care services for commercial patients under (higher-priced) brand-name hospital contracts. This would be orthogonal to a care model predicated on lowering health costs, and would in any case be less applicable to Medicare patients, where provider prices are much less variable.
* Can you help us learn more about how primary care direct contracting will work for you and help you grow more efficiently?
    * Direct Contracting is one of several options to assume risk on patients who remain enrolled in traditional Medicare, either by entering the program (if CMS re-opens applications) or by partnering with an existing Direct Contracting Entity.
    * Note: Having the ability to attach risk to patients on traditional Medicare decreases the pressure on Pine Park's patient switching efforts and increases our flexibility to serve ALF residents who prefer to remain enrolled in traditional Medicare. We will also explore other CMS value-based payment programs that may offer risk or shared savings on traditional Medicare enrollees.

## Care-Model

* Can you explain what a “micro-clinic" is?"
    * Our micro-clinic are “glorified closets” where we store our equipment and supplies. We provide home-based clinical care in residents' apartment facilities.
* What is the breadth of your services?
    * We provide in-home primary care services; these services include assessment and management of chronic diseases, medication management, and cognitive/social factors.
    * We also perform laboratory services, have mobile radiology partners, and can do procedures or basic wound care.
    * We focus on goals of care, deprescribing, and increasing or maintaining functional status.
* Are you offering urgent care?
    * Yes.
* How many patients are in CCM, and what are you monitoring?
    * 86% of patients with Pine Park for >4 weeks are in CCM. We monitor changes (diet, activity, mentation, self-reported concerns, changes reported by Med Techs or Caregivers), medication (missed doses, enough refills, match with on-record meds), reported blood sugar, blood pressure, weights, and functionality.
* What is the ratio of CN: Providers : Medical-Directors: Patients: Facilities?
    * 13 Care Navigators: 7 Provider NP: 1 Medical Director: 1000 patients: 26 facilities
* Can you share data on disease severity and mix (e.g., if your patients were in MA, about what their RAF score be and what are your most common diagnoses)?
    * Yes. Below is an analysis of Medicare claims data for a sample of ~1,400 patients who live in one of the Northern California facilities that we serve (via the CMS Qualified Entity program).
    * Note: Because these patients are all on traditional Medicare, we anticipate that these percentages understate the true disease prevalence in our population, to some extent. Nevertheless, with the exception of diabetes, these incidence rates are materially higher than in the original Medicare population as a whole. Dementia prevalence is particularly high, as might be expected, given that our average patient is roughly 10-11 years older than the average Medicare beneficiary. As of 2020, dementia (HCC 51 or HCC 52) carries a risk score weight of 0.346 for a facility non-dual aged beneficiary, which is similar to the weight for CHF.

**Chart: % of original Medicare beneficiaries in the assisted living communities that Pine Park serves, who have the following diagnoses recorded on 2020 claims**

| Diagnosis                     | Percentage |

*With respect to RAF, we anticipate a score of 1.9 - 2.0 once patients are fully documented.*

* What are the most common health issues residents suffer from in ALFs? Generally speaking, what are the leading causes for the high utilization of this population? How are you mitigating these causes?
    * The highest cost drivers are preventable hospitalizations, Skilled Nursing Facility days, and end-of-life care. For urgent care, we focus on being the first stop for::
        * UTIs,
        * Falls,
        * Confusion,
        * Medication mismanagement,
        * Chest pain
* Below is a breakdown of the % of costs for the 1400 panel of patients. The grey costs are costs that Pine Park can materially influence which make up >60% of cost categories.

* Are you measuring NPS? How do residents rank their experience?
    * Pine Park’s NPS is 65.
* What is your churn rate? What are the main reasons for patient attrition?
    * Our current churn rate starting in November 2020 is 9%. Our top reasons have been deceased (4), moved to a new location (3), and service (3).
* Is it part of your strategy to partner with vendors - imaging, labs, etc.? If yes, what would be the process?
    * We currently run basic tests/labs ourselves such as urinalysis or EKG. We send out blood draws to local laboratories (such as LabCorp or Quest). We partner with local mobile radiology groups. As we approach global capitation, we will begin to bring additional services in-house, such as podiatry, behavioral health, physical therapy, occupational therapy, and even potentially some specialists like Cardiologists.
* Are you offering pharmacy? If not, are you working with pharmacy vendors?
    * We are not licensed as a pharmacy vendor. We partner with pharmacies to ensure medications are sent to the facilities. We ensure that they are delivered and weekly check the Medication Administration Reports (MARs) to ensure refills are not missed. This will be augmented by PBM data with health plan integration.
* What happens when a patient gets admitted to an SNF? Are you following them?
    * When a patient is admitted to an SNF, we monitor their health and partner with the SNF staff for their care. We engage in daily updates, partner with case managers, discuss the case with their physician and maintain patient record requests. Our goal is to ensure continuity of care and facilitate timely discharges.
* Are your providers part-time or full-time?
    * Full-time. At scale, we anticipate recruiting local PCPs part-time to match market needs.
* Who is hiring your providers?
    * Today, all providers are hired by our Chief Medical Officer. In the future, Medical Directors will own hiring for their regions supported by Talent.
* What will you need to prove in terms of patient data? What are you going to invest in to get there?
    * We need to get to a Medical claim expense ratio of 60% (year 3 2025 cohort). This goal requires closing quality metrics, appropriately maximizing RAF scores, and tracking utilization of high-cost care
    * We are already obtaining NPS scores for patient experience, and have obtained data for matched cohorts to our current patients (by DOB, zip code, and assisted living) to understand benchmark costs. The next steps include obtaining patient specific utilization data.
* How long does it take you to train NPs to deliver value-based care?
    * We provide an intensive 2-week "mini-fellowship" training in geriatrics, person-centered care, value-based care, and palliative care. This allows our PCPs to understand the principles of risk tolerance and provide care through a value-based lens.
* Are you planning to employ part-time specialists? What kinds?
    * We will weigh the disease frequency and cost of outside providers against the cost to bring in-house over time. This means that behavioral health, cardiology, and nephrology as well as podiatry and/or physical therapy may all need to be employed part-time providers at scale.
* What do you expect the year-0 medical expense ratio will be?
    * 95%
* How much of the model is about up-coding as opposed to tackling utilization?
    * The care model is based on addressing goals of care (hospice transitions/palliative care), managing medications, and addressing acute avoidable hospitalizations (estimated at 10%-20% savings).
    * We expect a 10-20% lift in RAF from appropriately coding our patients.

## Operations

* How many providers and CNs are you planning to hire over the next year?
    * By the end of Q2 ‘22, we will need to employ 4 Medical Directors, 12-14 Nurse Practitioners, and 65-70 Care Navigators to deliver care.
* How are you planning to manage 200+ CNs / Providers without crashing? Most traditional provider groups fail to scale after reaching a certain size due to operational barriers.
    * We have proactively built our model to match for scale of primary care. (i) We are investing upfront in data collection/utilization for input care delivery metrics for operational oversight like process adherence, responsiveness, touchpoints, and quality measures. (ii) We build all operational workflows as playbooks, deploying processes to codify all work into repeatable SOPs and building adherence into our performance management. (iii) Our primary care product suite is built to enable coordination and data oversight of patient care at scale.
* What has been the most challenging part in terms of execution? What are some of the things that became easier?
    * Most challenging: hiring, training, staffing/scheduling, QA for the Care Navigator role. Requires matching the timing and geography of a qualified and trained CN with a facility launch, and once launched ensuring they are performing well with minimal hands-on oversight.
    * Easier: hiring providers. We expected Provider hiring to throttle care delivery but have found a stronger pipeline than expected (e.g. 2 open roles = 7 qualified NP candidates in 2 weeks, ready to start in avg. 2 weeks).
* What kind of work do you need to do to scale into a new market?
    * New market operations require meeting new regulatory/compliance requirements, standing up a care team (hiring a Medical Director, NPs, and a team of CNs), standing up a supply and facility launch infrastructure, and developing the local market vendor/provider network.
* How are you going to staff small facilities with less than ten patients?
    * All facilities that meet our qualification process will receive the same staffing - 1 CN split over 2 facilities, with provider schedules based on the patient count.
    * We are currently only targeting communities with at least 25 eligible residents.
* How are you training Care Navigators?
    * We stood up a rolling two-week training program with the ability to start any day of the week. Each day includes training and assessment. Includes 5 days of clinical training, 1 day of service and growth training, and 4 days of shadowing.
* What do you think about the trade-offs of small clinics versus the Oak Street or ChenMed-style medical centers? In theory, Oak Street has advantages like in-office labs, in-office radiology, and minor procedures/IV therapy, med dispensing, co-located behavioral health. You have an advantage in that it is much easier to do frequent quick check-ins on patients and to get ALF staff to help. When you net this all out, How do you think your clinical outcomes and hospital usage will compare?
    * Different patient populations require different approaches. The most significant health drivers are emergent health issues that require low equipment but more frequent touchpoints. We use the best of both worlds - being on-site optimized for reducing the highest volume/highest severity issues: faster response, regular preventative monitoring, and follow-through, while “hospital at home” mobile tools like radiology fill required needs.

## Competition

* Why can't Oak Street Health do what you do?
    * Different demographics.
        * Oak Street Health's patient demographics are different. Pine Park Health patients are older and sicker. The median age of a Pine Park Health patient is 87. The median age of an Oak Street Health patient is 67 is 69-year old.
        * Pine Park’s patients suffer from complex clinical issues. But they don't suffer from social issues. Our patient's social needs are met by ALF staff & infrastructure, reducing the load on our team.
    * Distributed model. To serve ALFs, Pine Park Health builds distributed clinics with specific technology and tools that support that.
    * Oak Street Health builds centralized medical centers that would not work for ALF residents.
* Why can't Dispatch do what you do?
    * Dispatch Health offers mobile urgent care, which is rather different from relationship-based primary care and requires both a different staff profile and a distinct operating model from onsite primary care. Dispatch would likely be ill-suited to take a global risk-on chronically ill patients, because a different (primary care) clinician would be responsible for managing the patient's medications, tracking lab results, etc.
* Why can't Cityblock do what you do?
    * Unlike Pine Park Health, Cityblock targets heterogeneous patient panels that include Medicaid, Dual, Medical, and commercial patients.

## Technology

* What software do you need, and what are you building versus buying?
    * Where possible, we are leveraging a 'low-code' approach - buying and configuring much of our HIPAA-ready technology. We are building where we can capture the value that is unique to our model.

* How certain are you that caregivers will utilize your platform?
    * Our CNs participate in morning/PM huddles, which creates a forcing function for caregivers to share and receive information from Pine Park Health. We then collect this information on our platform.

## Team

* Who hires the regional medical directors? What are you looking for in Medical Directors?
    * Our Chief Medical Officer recruits and hires the regional Medical Directors. The Medical Directors are evaluated on a variety of measures, but 3 particularly unique are 1) person-centered care 2) Team-based care/collaboration (do they think they're the most important person in the room?), 3) Risk Tolerance (do they send every patient to the ED or do they align with patient goals and understand risk mitigation in geriatric care?).
* Who else are you planning to hire for leadership positions?
    * Head of Data
    * General Counsel

## Actuals

    * 25 as of June 30, 2021
* What is your run rate?
    * 2021 FY Revenue (Pacing): $2.8M
* How much did you make in 2020?
    * 2020 FY Revenue: $4.3M
* What is your burn rate?
    * $800K
* How much money do you have in the bank? How long will it last?
    * $10.5M as of June 30, 2021; 13 months
* How many employees do you have? How many of them are CNs and providers?
    * Total: 81; CNs: 21; Providers: 7 (15 COVID testing/billing)

## General:

* What do you see as the limiting step for growth? I.e., Why are you not planning to scale to 1000 instead of 200 facilities next year?
    * Our model is decentralized and distributed, requiring a wider and less dense geographic span. That requires a more distributed care delivery model. Care delivery (hiring/training, quality management, coordination to reach total cost of care targets, while maintaining quality at scale) is the rate-limiting factor for growth.
* What are the main assumptions you proved over the past year?
    * Growth into new facilities (reached 25 facilities by Q2)
    * Growth within a facility (40% of eligible patients in less than 5 mos. at $400-500 CAC)
    * Acuity of patients (RAF = 2.0).
* What are general risks that you see for the business?
    * Execution Risk: managing hundreds of distributed clinics is hard.
        * In contrast to Oak Street, Iora, ChenMed, Our model is decentralized and distributed; we have to stretch our micro clinics across large geographies and hire CNs and doctors who will perform well with minimal oversight.
    * Low Medical Claims Expense Ratio Risk:
        * Our model only works if we can reduce care costs significantly. If we fail to reduce the total cost of care in less than three years, our model will not work.
    * Path To Risk:
        * We are now building a rocket, and this rocket will only launch when we can attach risk to patients. If we fail to attach risk to patients fast within four years, we will lose money on every patient as an FFS org.
    * Founder Risk. A young first-time with no direct experience in healthcare.

## Vision

* Where do you see the company in five years?
    * Our vision is to expand Pine Park to most adults on Medicare.
    * We are starting by opening micro-clinics in AL facilities.
    * We plan to grow in the future by serving residents living outside of these facilities. We will do that by serving residents living within a 5-15 min radius of our facilities.
    * Our vision is to create a healthcare system where seniors never need to visit a hospital to stay healthy. Instead, seniors will get all their healthcare locally or at home. To accomplish this vision, we will distribute the hospital to the places where seniors live, starting with ALFs.
