## Slide 6: Yet clinics still struggle to find & retain qualified patients

# Yet clinics still struggle to find & retain qualified patients

*   **Awareness**
    *   75,000+ daily Google searches for
        “ketamine therapy” in the US
    *   More than 2,000+ US clinics but no
        structured directory for patients
    *   Unaware of ketamine as a relevant,
        legal, and safe treatment modality
*   **Trust and safety**
    *   FDA-approved but stigma around
        safety
    *   No trusted expert in the
        space for recommendations
    *   Complex onboarding processes
*   **Cost**
    *   Typical ketamine infusion package is
        $4,000+ if cash pay
    *   Unclear CPT/DRG codes makes it
        difficult to estimate cost
    *   Complex credentialing process with
        rapidly evolving payer
        reimbursement
