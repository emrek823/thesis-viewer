**CHANNEL PARTNERS¹** (Middle Box, pointing to Self-Funded Entity/Employer)
- Stop-Loss
- TPA
- Captive
- Broker

**KEY**
Channel Partners who double as Solution Partners

**Sales Strategies:**

- **Going Direct**
  Jumbo employers (50K+ employees) often work directly solution providers, as they have the in-house expertise to evaluate.
  Our direct relationships with Boeing and Amazon highlight the strong relationships that can be built directly.

- **Strategic Partnerships**
  Most employers have relationships of trust with brokers, TPAs, and other healthcare players.
  By working with these players, we benefit from their organic member growth YoY, adding new members at little to no S&M cost.
  **Example:** We are Mercer's preferred analytics provider; as Mercer adds lives to their book, we add lives to our analytics platform.

Some Channel Partners have complementary solutions to ours.
Nomi therefore is a distribution partner to our Solution Partners.
As our Partners grow, we grow.

**2024 Key Growth Drivers**
- **Network:** Launching our Full Network Replacement product on 04/01/24 which captures 100% of medical spend.

**What is NRR and how do we calculate it?**
We supplement the traditional financial metrics with Net Reoccurring Revenue (NRR), which strips out pass-through costs common in healthcare and reflects the highly predictable revenue that is common in technology businesses.
**Formula:**
Revenue of Each Business Unit
- Drug Spend from Pharmacy Management.
- Medical Spend from Network
= Net Reoccurring Revenue

**Traditional Plan Build**

**Employer**
- **Broker / Consultant** (connects to all categories below)
  - **Analytics** (1, 3, 2, 4 options)
  - **Plan Admin. TPA** (1, 3, 2, 4 options)
    - **Medical Network** (1, 2 options)
    - **Payment Services** (1 option)
  - **Stop-Loss** (1, 3, 2, 4 options)
  - **PBM** (1, 3, 2, 4 options)
  - **Point Solutions** (1, 3, 2, 4 options)

**Plan Build with Nomi**

**Employer**
- **Broker / Consultant** (connects to Nomi Health)
  - **Nomi Health** (as a central entity for Analytics, Plan Admin. TPA, PBM, Medical Network, Payment Services, Stop-Loss, Point Solutions)
    - **Analytics** (Nomi Health)
    - **Plan Admin. TPA** (Nomi Health)
    - **Stop-Loss** (Nomi Health)
    - **PBM** (Nomi Health)
    - **Medical Network** (Nomi Health)
    - **Point Solutions** (Nomi Health)
    - **Payment Services** (Nomi Health)

In the traditional plan build, employers and their partners are faced with an array of options in each category. Brokers often request bids and vet multiple PBMs, networks, and analytics and payment services platforms. The Nomi plan build offers a streamlined solution and integrations with partners options, reducing the optionality and complexity.

## Slide 30: Our cost savings in action: Saving employer plans 30% on their health spend.

Our cost savings in action:
Saving employer plans 30% on their health spend.

**Status Quo**
- Employers Pay Payers: $115
- For a Network Rate of: $100
- Providers Get Paid: $75
  (Time gap: 2-9 Months)

**With Nomi Health**
- Employers Pay: $88
- For Nomi's Network Rate of: $80
- Providers Get Paid: $80
  (Time gap: Same Day)

By removing co-pays, deductibles, and utilizing a simpler prior-authorization structure we negotiate industry best network rates with providers

**SUBSEQUENT VISITS AND PHYSICAN REFERRALS**
- > 150M+ physician referrals annually
- This leads to multiplicative effect on costs, which are exacerbated under status quo model.
- By controlling the access layer, we can ensure physicians refer to only high-quality, low-cost providers.
