Concurrent Review Proposal
Spring 2024

## Slide 2: Background - The Annual Wellness Visit
**Background**
**The Annual Wellness Visit**

The Annual Wellness Visit (AWV) is a multifaceted tool for healthcare providers. It not only allows them to develop or update personalized prevention plans aimed at disease prevention and disability, tailored to each patient's unique health profile but also serves as an effective means to address outstanding hierarchical condition categories (HCC's) for risk adjustment, enhancing practice revenue. Additionally, the AWV aids in closing existing HEDIS gaps, thereby contributing to an improved star rating for the practice.

## Slide 3: Original Findings - General PCP Issues with AWV Completion
**Original Findings**
**General PCP Issues with AWV Completion**

*   **Incomplete Data**
*   **Hard to schedule and reach patients to do AWV**
*   **Follow-ups are administratively burdensome**
*   **Takes a long time to complete**

## Slide 4: Original Findings - Clever Care AWV Completion Friction
**Original Findings**
**Clever Care AWV Completion Friction**

PCPs aren't meeting Clever Care's AWV frequency and completion rate expectations.

*   **Irregular Delivery of Data**
    Based on our interviews, providers aren't consistently receiving updated data on gaps and risk adjustment opportunities. However, this is expected to improve once the portal is launched.

*   **Takes Too Much Time**
    Providers face the huge administrative challenge of locating missing data, scheduling patients for AWVs, and managing both clinical and non-clinical follow-up tasks.

*   **Missing Data**
    Through previously submitted AWVs and submitted claims, current Family History, Social History, Medication, Lab, and other data from past annual wellness visits are stored with Clever Care. However, this information is not routinely shared with PCPs.

*   **Payment**
    Clever receives the AWV chart and claim within 45 days of the service date 70% of the time. Providers are compensated after the AWV charts are obtained and the AWV claims are processed.

## Slide 5: Conclusions After Initial Pilot - From Clever Care PCP's
**Conclusions After Initial Pilot**
**From Clever Care PCP's**

*   **Data Inconsistencies**
    The data held by health plans significantly differs from and is inconsistent with the data possessed by PCP's

*   **Confusing Incentives**
    PCPs are frustrated by the complex and varied incentives offered by different health plans and 3rd party vendors, such as Stellar.

*   **Portal Frustrations**
    The multitude of logins required for different portals, each with unique logins, creates confusion and poses challenges for training.

*   **Rigid Processes**
    PCP's find it challenging to adapt and tailor their workflows to accommodate the specific requirements of each health plan.

The PCPs' have shown a preference for the Valley Steer AWV Summary over the pre-populated Clever Care AWV forms. This preference stems from PCPs' inclination to utilize a guiding framework that allows them to personally complete their own AWV documentation.

## Slide 6: Conclusions After Initial Pilot - From Clever Care
**Conclusions After Initial Pilot**
**From Clever Care**

*   **Unsubmitted Claims**
    Many PCPs in the region tend to delay submitting their claims, often for more than two quarters, due to the incentives inherent in the capitated contract structure. This delay in claim submission leads to data inconsistencies with HEDIS and Risk Adjustment at the health plan level. It also results in confusion during the data reconciliation process between the health plan and PCPs.

*   **Data Request Delays**
    When Clever Care's Risk Adjustment team seeks clarifications on Annual Wellness Visit (AWV) data from the PCP, and Centauri subsequently produces a revised and corrected 837 claim, the process frequently extends beyond six months from the original service date. This data backlog is expected to increase as Clever Care continues to expand its membership.

## Slide 7: Proposed Modification For Pilot
**Proposed Modification For Pilot**
Integrate with Practice Management Systems and Offer Concurrent Coding Services

*   **Data Extraction**
    We possess technology that integrates with PCP's practice management systems, enabling us to extract scheduler data to notify Clever Care about member appointments and gather encounter details for completed visits.

*   **Coding Support**
    Currently, most PCPs lack coders. PCPs will be provided with coders to help generate a clean and accurate claim.

*   **Pay More**
    PCPs will be compensated a variable rate that reflects the thoroughness and accuracy of their documentation, facilitating clean coding.

*   **Pay Instantly**
    PCPs will be paid immediately after coders gather enough details from the submitted AWV charts to create a comprehensive claim. We target a 2 working-day turnaround from chart receipt to its full coder review.

This is a flowchart illustrating the proposed process:

1.  **Provider Office** sends **Patient AWV**.
2.  **Patient AWV** proceeds to **Review and Code AWV** (with a 1-2 day delay).
3.  From **Review and Code AWV**:
    *   If **AWV Complete?** is **No**, it goes to **Request AWV Docs**.
    *   From **Request AWV Docs**, it loops back to **Review and Code AWV**.
    *   If **AWV Complete?** is **Yes**, it goes to **Process AWV and Claim**.
4.  **Patient AWV** also directly goes to **Process AWV and Claim**.
5.  **Clever Care** is involved in the **Process AWV and Claim** step.
6.  The result of **Process AWV and Claim** is **Process AWV Claim**.
7.  An optional path exists from **AWV Complete? (Yes)** directly to **Process AWV Claim**.

## Slide 12: Incentive 1: Early Submission Reward Pool
**Incentive 1: Early Submission Reward Pool**
Incentivizing PCPs to conduct and share AWV results earlier in the year offers numerous benefits.

**Chart: Offer a variable payment based on the date of receipt.**

| Quarter | Payment (Estimated) |
| :------ | :------------------ |
| Q1      | $120                |
| Q2      | $60                 |
| Q3      | $20                 |
| Q4      | $0                  |

*   **Timely Risk Adjustment Data Capture:** Early AWVs enable more accurate and prompt capture of Hierarchical Condition Categories (HCCs), essential for risk adjustment.
*   **Enhanced HEDIS Performance:** Completing AWVs early allows for earlier compliance with HEDIS measures, improving overall scores.
*   **Opportunity for Comprehensive Care Management:** Early identification of care gaps provides a full year for interventions and care management, benefiting both risk adjustment and HEDIS metrics.
*   **Avoidance of Year-End Rush:** Conducting AWVs early prevents end-of-year congestion, ensuring more thorough assessments and data quality for risk adjustment and HEDIS reporting.

## Slide 13: Incentive 2: Clean AWV on 1st Submission
**Incentive 2: Clean AWV on 1st Submission**

PCPs submitting clean charts that comprehensively address all HEDIS gaps and RAF opportunities significantly reduce the operational burden for both themselves and their partnered risk-bearing entities. A "clean" AWV chart should have sufficient code-able MEAT (Monitor, Evaluate, Assess, Treatment) criteria to support coding for 85% of the relevant HEDIS G-Codes and HCC's.

*   **Increased Operational Efficiency:** First-time accurate claims eliminate the need for time-intensive retrospective chart reviews, streamlining the overall process.
*   **Faster Reimbursement Cycle:** Accurate initial submissions lead to quicker reimbursements, reducing delays and improving cash flow for healthcare providers.
*   **Reduced Administrative Overhead:** Avoiding retrospective reviews lowers the administrative workload and associated costs, enhancing operational cost-effectiveness.
*   **Enhanced Data Quality and Compliance:** Initial accuracy in claims ensures better data quality and adherence to compliance standards, reducing the risk of audits and penalties.

## Slide 14: Incentive 3: Generating Clean Claim Upon Querying
**Incentive 3: Generating Clean Claim Upon Querying**

This incentive is vital for promoting precise coding by aligning incentives between PCPs and coders from risk-bearing entities. PCPs will receive payment solely for verified HCCs. For the first year, verified HCCs will be those suspected but not previously documented in prior years.

*   **Valuing Time and Expertise:** Compensation for PCPs acknowledges their valuable time spent on documentation inquiries, encouraging detailed and efficient responses.
*   **Offsetting Workload and Promoting Efficiency:** Payments help balance the additional workload and incentivize promptness, essential for effective coding and billing processes.
*   **Aligning Interests and Ensuring Quality:** Financial incentives align PCP efforts with the goals of accurate documentation and coding, while fostering positive collaborative relationships.

## Slide 16: This program targets a 5x Return on Investment per AWV
**This program targets a 5x Return on Investment per AWV**

*   **Base Rate: $25 PMPM**
    This fee pertains to our incentive and payments platform. Currently, Clever Care offers providers an incentive for each completed AWV, but this incentive doesn't focus on data fidelity or risk adjustment up front. We suggest a system to enable Clever Care to more effectively capitalize on the financial and data expediency benefits of concurrent coding.

*   **Performance: $75 Per Completed Query**
    This fee is designed to align incentives, ensuring that all relevant clinical documentation is efficiently captured during the AWV process. It acts as a performance fee, coordinating payments among Valley Steer, providers, and Clever Care, and is contingent on all three parties receiving payment. This approach aims to maximize efficiency and financial outcomes in the AWV process.
