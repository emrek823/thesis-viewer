## Slide 4: Data & Market Intelligence is Critical

Questions our customers ask

**PE Investor**
"We need to know which markets to focus our investments on and who we can actionably pursue."
Inform a $200M-$500M Investment

**Health System**
“We need to know the gaps in our clinical network that are leading to revenue leakage."
$35M Problem for Local Health System

**Large Payer**
"We need to know if Optum is buying up a critical concentration of providers in any of our counties.”
Board Level Priority

**Large Payer**
“We need to know providers we can change in our network to improve STAR ratings."
$100M for 100k Covered Lives

## Slide 5: Existing Solutions are Expensive & Poor Quality

Answering strategic questions typically requires heavy services along with expensive data purchases

### Services or Internal Team
*   Large PE Groups Pay > $1M to a consulting firm to understand the provider market landscape for a single specialty.
    *   They then pay $500K for each large transaction in a new market. This is required by investors & lenders.
*   Health Plans pay > $1M to consultants to benchmark provider utilization.
*   Health Systems pay > $1M to consultants to understand the provider landscape & physician supply.

### Data Aggregator
*   **IQVIA**
    *   **Slow**
    *   **Requires Expertise**
    *   "$1M/yr +"
    *   "They still require services to get anything useful out of the data" - Biopharma
*   **komodo HEALTH**
    *   "Their data is quite comprehensive but still requires extensive domain knowledge as well as a team of data scientists to get useful insights"
*   **PurpleLab? HEALTHCARE ANALYTICS**
    *   "They provided more data than we need but it required us to do a lot of work to pull out the insights we need. We'll go with someone who's offering direct solutions in the future" - Data Scientist VBC company

### Solutions Vendor
*   **DEFINITIVE HEALTHCARE**
    *   **Poor Quality**
    *   "$250k/yr"
    *   "I've checked their payer distributions for the groups I used to work for and they're totally off" - PE Backed Provider Group CFO
    *   "Their provider data module was completely un-intuitive, without knowing the local market affiliations we couldn't get anything useful out of it" - Clinical Development @ Large IDN

Customers NEED Accurate Information & Want a user-friendly, cost-effective solution with Meaningful Insights

## Slide 7: We Have Significant Traction

We've proven demand & built a robust pipeline with $0 Paid Marketing & minimal capital

Details provided during diligence

### Closed
*   Initial Investment (Nov 22) **$250k**
*   Large Health Tech
*   2x Small Health Tech
*   **$100k**

### Bottom of Funnel
*   2x Tech Enabled Primary Care
*   Small Health Tech
*   Medium Health Tech
*   **Expected $150k** (Probability Weighted)

### Qualified Top of Funnel
*   2x Strategy Firm
*   2x Payer
*   2x Health Systems
*   Multiple PE Groups
*   2x Health Tech
*   **Expected $500k** (Probability Weighted)

## Slide 8: Our Approach is Defensible & Differentiated

### Claims
*   Provide scale in data collection
*   **Competitors:** Operate 100 FTE call centers

### ML (Machine Learning)
*   Scales domain knowledge
*   **Competitors:** Haven’t thoughtfully structured the problem to make applicable.

### Domain Knowledge
*   Required to make claims useful
*   **Competitors:** Require customers to be experts in claims billing

### Impact
*   Faster Time to Value
*   Higher Quality Insights
*   Lower Internal Ops Cost

## Slide 9: Why now?

### 1 Industry Tailwinds
*   **VBC & MA incentivize risk based contracting**
    *   The value of a FFS primary care patient is $20 pmpm. Risk based is $200-400 pmpm
*   **Consolidators (M&A) from all directions**
    *   PE, Health Systems, Enablement Cos, VC Health Tech, Ind. Sponsors
*   **Shift from Inpatient to Ambulatory Network**

*   **1,000 Large Transactions Executed per Year**

### 2 Shifting Healthcare Data Market Dynamics
*   Access to data at scale has become feasible

VBC = Value Based Care; MA = Medicare Advantage; PMPM = Per Member Per Month

## Slide 10: Competitive Landscape

If data is a commodity, value will accrue to companies that make it useful

### Solutions Vendors
*   Weren’t built with claims because of data access and cost

### Data Aggregators
*   Don’t want to cannibalize lucrative raw data sales
*   Moat is eroding from claims data commoditization

### Data Originators
*   Opened up who they’ll license to
*   Don’t have scale to provide solutions themselves

### Diagram Data Extraction:

**Actionability Axis (Y-axis)**

**Data Flow**

*   **Data Originators:**
    *   WAYSTAR
    *   CVS
    *   Cigna
    *   CHANGE HEALTHCARE
    *   aetna
    *   athenahealth
    *   Symphony Health (A PRAHEALTHSCIENCES COMPANY)

*   **Data Aggregators (inner circle to outer circle):**
    *   IQVIA
    *   komodo HEALTH

*   **Solutions Vendors (purple circle):**
    *   DEFINITIVE HEALTHCARE
    *   Ribbon

*   **HEALTHDATAATLAS (top green circle):** Showing an arrow originating from Data Aggregators/Solutions Vendors towards HealthDataAtlas, suggesting it consumes data from these sources or provides a superior solution built on their data.
