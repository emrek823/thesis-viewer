### Current Fund Performance & Strategy Shifts

- Most active quarter for markups; expecting exciting raises in Q1 (January)
- No new investments in several months - maintaining high bar and patience
- Fund II ($55M) oversubscribed with 100+ commitments, leaving upside on table
	- Led ~75% of deals from Fund II
	- 3/4 investments were only institutional investor
	- 2/4 were sole investor with no angels
- Structural shift in seed market: software development costs plummeted over 18-24 months
	- Easy to build V1/prototype but investment market hasn’t adjusted discernment
	- Everyone getting funded but only 10-15% graduate to Series A
	- Top-tier generalists (Andreessen, Sequoia, Green Oaks, Founders Fund) flooding seed market with 100x+ AUM advantage

### Bling Ventures Assessment

- Co-invested via Amai (Fund I, third investment)
	- Negotiated 3 at 11.5 post vs. founder’s ask of 4-5 at 20-25 post
	- Ben Weltman won deal through aggressive responsiveness (7pm Tuesday, committed same night)
- Positive founder feedback on Ben’s direct, honest assessment style
- Concerns about competitive positioning:
	- Lack deep digital health expertise in increasingly complex market
	- Hard to compete against dedicated health teams at tier-one firms
	- Question their right to win without sector-specific value-add
- Limited deal flow sharing due to Virtue’s lead-heavy strategy and founder preference for strategically aligned investors

### 12 Below Capital Views

- Strong relationship via Byron (individual LP in Fund I)
- Co-invested in Solstice; Byron highly trusted by founders
- Byron’s strengths: responsive, delivers on commitments, high-trust partner
- Similar syndication pattern as Bling - Virtue leads, then syndicates selectively
- Would co-invest again but questioning need to syndicate given fund constraints

### Seven Wire Ventures Perspective

- Personal respect for Alyssa and Lee as individuals
- Strategic concerns about “connected consumer” thesis alignment with current market
- Few portfolio founders requesting Seven Wire intros for Series A
- Market shift away from tech-enabled services toward AI-native/embedded AI products
- Founders typically seeking tier-one generalists (Sequoia, GV) for brand halo and technical credibility
- Oak HC/FT Fund 6 explicitly avoiding care delivery investments unless exceptional
- Virtue’s care delivery allocation: 50% (Fund I) → 25% → 12% (current trend)
