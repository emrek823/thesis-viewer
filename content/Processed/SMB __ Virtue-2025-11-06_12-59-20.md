### Sanofi Partnership Update

- Onboarded for the POC - $300k
	- Take the model developed with BMS and bring it into Sanofi’s environment
	- Galen felt bad things took longer, wants press release by JPM - “We’ll bill it as a POC”
- Nominal scope of work
	- Enrollment model for I/E criteria matching patients to protocols
	- Predict when patients will be made available using RWD in Sanofi’s environment
	- Galen’s ambitions bigger - get something that’s clearly a value-add on paper
- Long-term impact opportunities
	- Optimizing entire programs, not just single trials
	- Simulate I/E criteria with favorable enrollment characteristics
	- Probability of technical and regulatory success (PTRS)
	- Galen as ecosystem thinker - wanted to power partners like Paradigm at BMS
	- “I want you to go train on other people’s data because it will make it more valuable to us”
	- Doesn’t see Sanofi’s data as competitive edge - believes tools compete, not assets
- Larger $5M partnership progressing through BD, hoping to wrap by December

### Partnership Pipeline & Strategy

- Tempus developments
	- Sent proposal from Chief of Staff two weeks ago - haven’t heard back (suggests they’re shopping)
	- Another SVP reached out wanting technical deep dive
	- Particularly interested in foundation models on genomics side
- Pathos engagement
	- Eric Shat (CSO) views himself as driver, big bet on AI-driven biomarkers for next generation trials
	- Open to SMB powering this long-term, waiting to schedule with ER
	- Investing $250M out of $400M raised to build capability
	- Doesn’t see them owning technology long-term - will monetize and develop assets
- Real world data provider discussions
	- Dandelion, Nash Bio hesitant - concerned about SMB eating their lunch
	- “Give us a week” response from Dandelion (Elliot was straightforward)
	- Waiting for one domino to crumble, then expect others to follow

### Data Acquisition & AMC Strategy

- Biological vs clinical positioning question
	- Medicine getting very precise - AI-driven biomarkers require AI-driven patient selection
	- Patient selection evolving from basic criteria to highly specific biomarker thresholds
	- Narrative challenge: “skating to where the puck’s going” but looks disorganized in current moment
- AMC partnerships value proposition
	- Validation - “Has this been validated?” point to MD Anderson validation for specific use case
	- Data access - eventually leverage relationships for favorable data deals
- Data acquisition strategy using fundraise proceeds
	- Buy pre-provisioned data at 15 cents per scan (much cheaper than first-time buyers)
	- Target tech transfer offices with “give us what you gave the last guy” approach
	- Goal: roll up plurality of data more cost-effectively than competitors

### Fundraising & Next Steps

- Timeline: Q1 fundraise, ideally from position of strength with $5M Sanofi contract signed
- Dual pharma and AMC track narrative coalescing
- Use fundraise money for:
	- Making AMCs happy through data purchases
	- Long pharma contract development (these take years - Galen discussion started before he joined Sanofi)
- Additional pipeline mentions
	- AstraZeneca collaboration converting to paid engagement
	- Crohn’s and Colitis Foundation interested (multimodal data including whole genome sequencing, endoscopy videos)
	- 90% year-over-year growth but concerned about cannibalizing RWD business
