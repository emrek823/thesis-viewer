## Policy Context

Rates of obesity have been rising since the 1980s, and today approximately 42% of adults have obesity.1 Current policies have failed to reverse these trends and their complex sequelae—including greater rates of diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, stroke and cancer. Although effective anti-obesity medications (AOMs) are now available, access remains a challenge, as Medicare and many private insurance plans do not cover them. The question becomes: Is it worth it to society to invest in broader access?

We estimate the social returns to AOM treatment across the adult population and how these returns vary with underlying health risks. Specifically, our analysis simulates lifetime outcomes from treating obesity including life years gained, life years with diabetes avoided, net lifetime social value and the rate of social return on investment.

Our results show that broad access to AOMs generates significant societal benefits. Life expectancy rises by as much as 1.8 years, and Americans spend fewer years living with chronic diseases like diabetes. Although all patients accrue positive net social value from treatment, younger and healthier patients (i.e., those with lower diabetes risk score or moderate BMI ranging from 30–39) accrue the greatest social returns. The estimated benefits vary by age and health-risk group, but we find that broad access generates real returns exceeding 13% per year even after accounting for treatment costs—performing better than the U.S. stock market over this century. Our results suggest significant social loss from limiting GLP-1 coverage.

## Key Takeaways

* Despite their demonstrated efficacy, GLP-1s are frequently not covered by insurers for weight loss. Less than one-third of insurers—and only 1% of individual Affordable Care Act market plans—provide coverage.
* Investing in expanded access to AOMs generates substantial social returns, even after accounting for treatment costs. The social returns exceed those from other private and public capital investments commonly recognized as valuable.
* Perhaps surprisingly, the social returns from treating obesity are highest for those who are younger and at lower risk, thereby casting doubt on policies limiting AOM coverage to people with pre-existing conditions like diabetes.

## Abstract

Obesity is a public health crisis in the United States. Despite demonstrated efficacy, anti-obesity medications (AOM) are frequently not covered by insurers and Medicare for weight loss. Analysis of the potential returns to treatment are needed to inform the debate for broader access to AOMs.

We estimate the lifetime social returns from expanding AOM treatment for various ages and risk groups using the Future Adult Model (FAM), a dynamic microsimulation of American adults. We simulate lifetime outcomes for a cohort of Americans aged 25 years or older in 2025 who do not have diabetes but who do qualify for AOM treatments based on FDA-approved indications (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2, or BMI ≥ 27 kg/m2 and a weight-related comorbidity). We compare outcomes under the status quo and with a policy that provides expanded access to those eligible for treatment. We assume AOMs reduce body weight by 15–20%, based on both trial and real-world evidence for patients without diabetes, and generic GLP-1s become available in 2032. We estimate lifetime trajectories of health, medical spending and compute social benefits net of AOM treatment costs. We summarize the results by measuring the internal rate of return to expanded access to AOMs by age and risk groups.

Our results find that expanded access to AOMs generates significant benefits. Life expectancy rises, and Americans spend fewer years living with chronic diseases like diabetes. People initiating therapy between 25 and 34 years of age gain as much as 1.8 years of life while spending up to 5.9 fewer years without diabetes. After accounting for treatment costs, total lifetime net social value is positive for all people except those age 65–74 with a BMI < 30 kg/m2. The social rate of return from expanded access exceeds 13% for all subgroups with BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2.

## Introduction

Obesity represents a serious and largely unmitigated public health crisis in the United States. Rates of obesity have been rising since the 1980s, and today approximately 42% of adults have obesity.1 Absent effective intervention, the prevalence of obesity could exceed 50% in the next decade.2 Current policies have failed to reverse these trends and their complex sequelae—including greater rates of diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, stroke and cancer.3-5 Obesity is the second-leading cause of preventable deaths, and society spends $260 billion annually treating the disease.6

The introduction of a new class of anti-obesity medications (AOMs) offers an opportunity to better address this crisis. Semaglutide and tirzepatide are weekly glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) injections originally approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat diabetes and more recently approved to treat obesity. In clinical trials, higher doses of these drugs helped people lose 15% and 20% of their body weight, respectively.7,8 GLP-1s have demonstrated efficacy in preventing cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease and pre-diabetes; and ongoing trials are exploring their efficacy against sleep apnea, Parkinson’s disease and other chronic conditions.9-12 Additional multi-specific peptides offer the chance of improved tolerability or efficacy for future users.13

Despite their demonstrated efficacy, GLP-1s are frequently not covered by insurers for weight loss. Fewer than one-third of insurers—and only 1% of individual Affordable Care Act market plans—provide coverage.14,15 This may not be surprising, since private insurers can be reluctant to invest in prevention,16,17 and the benefits of weight loss may not be fully realized until people transition to Medicare. Additionally, the high prevalence of obesity has led to headline-grabbing estimates of total treatment costs.18,19 However, broader access could generate substantial long-term benefits. Decisions about expanding access—either in private or public insurance programs—would benefit from estimates of the lifetime returns to treatment and how they vary within the population.

We estimate the social returns to expanded AOM treatment using the Future Adult Model (FAM), a dynamic microsimulation of American adults aged 25 and older. FAM and its predecessors were featured in two National Academies of Science reports,20,21 and variants have been developed globally.22 FAM has been shown to perform at least as well as actuarial models, while providing more information on quality of life and economic outcomes.23 FAM has been used to study the value of access to novel treatments generally,24-26 with specific applications to Alzheimer’s disease,27,28 elevated lipids,29-31 heart failure,32 cardiovascular risks33 and delayed aging.34 This makes FAM well suited to estimate the lifetime costs and benefits of expanded access to GLP-1s and how they differ by age and underlying risk.

## Methods

The FAM combines data from several large, nationally representative surveys: the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) and the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS). The transitions underlying FAM come from the PSID, a longitudinal survey tracking people from age 25 and their family members. The combination of datasets provides more comprehensive information than any single national survey.

Using FAM, we simulate lifetime outcomes for a nationally representative cohort of Americans aged 25 years or older who do not have diabetes but who do qualify for AOM treatments based on the FDA-approved indications (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2, or BMI ≥ 27 kg/m2 and a weight-related comorbidity). The simulation starts in 2025, and we project lifetime trajectories of health, medical spending, AOM treatment costs and other economic outcomes, facilitating calculations of net societal value and rates of return for alternative AOM uptake scenarios. This approach is depicted in e in the supplemental materials; a full technical description of the model is available online.35

FAM has a two-year cycle that mimics the frequency of the underlying survey data. Each cycle, FAM predicts AOM treatment costs, health outcomes and total healthcare spending. We simulate lifetime outcomes for each individual with—and without—expanded AOM access, and then report differential outcomes by age and risk subgroup. More detail is provided below.

## AOM Treatment Costs

To estimate treatment cost, we use the net price of AOM medications currently available for weight loss. Net prices account for the (often hidden) discounts negotiated by pharmacy benefit managers, government and other payers. While exact drug-specific discounts are confidential, researchers have estimated discounts of roughly 52% off list price generally.36 For semaglutide, researchers estimated 41% discounts in 2022, prior to the introduction of tirzepatide.37 Using more recent data, Congressional Budget Office estimated average AOM net prices of $5,900 per year, which serves as our treatment cost in the initial year.38

We then project AOM treatment costs annually, informed by four market observations. First, branded net prices have fallen or remained relatively stable, in real terms, over the past decade.39,40 Second, on average, prices fall 74% below the pre-expiration list price when generics enter the market.*a* 41 Third, experience with other high-cost classes, like novel drugs for hepatitis C and HIV, suggests branded competition brings prices down before generic entry.42 And fourth, the AOM pipeline is very robust, with 124 medications in clinical trials as of March 2024—eight of which are being tested in phase 3 trials.43 Thus, we conservatively assume constant net prices until semaglutide’s patent expires in 2031. We allow for a 50% price drop in the first year of generic competition (2032) and the full 74% decrease in the second year (2033).41 We assume the generic price persists after the second year. While there is a robust peptide pipeline,44 we conservatively do not allow prices to fall before generic entry.

## Health Outcomes

FAM uses individual characteristics to estimate health transition probabilities across two-year periods. Transition probabilities are modeled as clinically informed first-order Markov processes depending on age, sex, education, race, health conditions, body mass index (BMI) and functional status. Health conditions such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes, cancer and lung disease are self-reported in the PSID, and chronic health conditions are treated as absorbing—i.e., once people report being diagnosed with a condition, they have that condition until death. In every model cycle, FAM uses the health transition models to predict each person’s health status, which in turn informs estimates of medical spending and other policy outcomes.

We model obesity in FAM to mimic specific features of long-term weight-management treatments, as described in prior research.45 Specifically, we adjust for self-reporting bias in BMI using data on measured versus reported heights and weights from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. And, to account for its persistence, we allow an individual’s BMI in the prior two cycles (four years total) to impact current BMI projections in a log-linear format with splines at BMI levels of 20, 25, 30, 35 and 40 kg/m2.

## Healthcare Spending

FAM predicts total medical spending as a function of age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, chronic health conditions and BMI. The estimates represent total medical expenditures save for AOM treatment costs, which we model separately. For those under the age of 65, we base our estimates of total medical expenditures on the MEPS. Then, for everyone age 65 and older and those who qualify for Medicare due to federal disability enrollment, we base our estimates of total medical spending on the MCBS and include functional limitations, nursing home residency and mortality as additional explanatory variables.

## Expanded Access to AOMs

We consider two scenarios: the status quo and expanded access to AOMs (“treatment scenario”). Under the status quo, FAM simulates outcomes for the cohort of individuals who:

1. Do not have an existing diabetes diagnosis;
2. Are aged 25 or older;
3. Qualify, under FDA guidelines, to take new GLP-1 weight-loss treatments (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2, or BMI ≥ 27 kg/m2 and a weight-related comorbidity).

The status quo scenario holds current coverage policies and rates constant, leaving access to new therapies unchanged and uptake at current levels. The expanded access scenario gives clinically eligible people access (insurance coverage) to a treatment that reduces BMI by 20%, reflecting mean weight loss from recent clinical trials in higher-dose regimens.7,8 Evidence suggests that treatment discontinuation can lead to people rapidly regaining weight lost during treatment. Therefore, we assumed that people remain on continuous therapy to maintain their initial weight loss. To reflect natural weight fluctuations after treatment, we model weight using FAM’s empirically based BMI transition model but cap total weight gain or loss at 5% of post-treatment BMI. We lift these caps at age 75 to allow for the natural weight loss seen in elderly populations. To estimate the costs and benefits associated with expanded access to AOM treatments, we compare lifetime health and healthcare spending outcomes between the two scenarios.

## Risk Groups

The lifetime benefits of weight reduction likely accrue heterogeneously, depending on age and underlying risk. Treating those with the highest BMI might focus on people most vulnerable to adverse outcomes, but treating earlier in the BMI growth process provides more opportunities to avoid irreversible complications. Similarly, starting treatment at younger ages may prevent more chronic disease but also bring more years of cost. To study how benefits are distributed, we stratify people by age at treatment initiation and by risk assessed one of two ways:

1. BMI at time of treatment initiation; and
2. 10-year risk of developing diabetes at treatment initiation

The PSID survey follows people longitudinally over time and tracks their development of chronic conditions. We use responses in 2009 and 201
