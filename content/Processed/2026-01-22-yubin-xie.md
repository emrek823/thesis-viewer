# About me

I am a machine learning scientst in AI oncology startup Noetik. I did my PhD in Tri-Institutional PhD Program in Computational Biology and Medicine and I studied cancer progression and metastasis with high-dimension sequencing and imaging data with machine learning and deep learning. I am interested in applying machine learning to resolve real-life problems.
