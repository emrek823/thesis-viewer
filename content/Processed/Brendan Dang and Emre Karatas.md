### Company Background & Team

- Brendan Dang backstory
	- Grew up in Houston, TX, low income household ($25k/year)
	- Studied neuroscience and psychology at UT Austin (full ride)
	- Master’s in AI + Biology at UC Berkeley
	- Worked at Broad Institute (MIT/Harvard) on cancer models, especially pediatric brain tumors
	- Connected with major hospitals and pharmaceutical companies
- Josh Hinckley backstory
	- Family challenges at 13 (mom jailed, dad had leukemia)
	- Chemical engineer grandfather as mentor
	- Cornell PhD and Master’s in chemistry, focused on nanomedicines
	- FDA doesn’t like inorganic components (quantum dots problem)
	- During pandemic did 2 post-docs simultaneously:
		- MIT - biomanufacturing, monoclonal antibodies with major pharma (Pfizer, Takeda, Novartis)
		- Broad Institute - ML for acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs)
	- Wife diagnosed with rare cancer (GIST - 3 tumors, 13cm each)
	- Started company when wife was diagnosed, now she’s 100% cancer free
- Company founded as “love letter” during wife’s cancer treatment
- Connected through mutual friend Kunal

### Technology & Process

- Building AI layer for biomanufacturing (matches Kunal’s AI lab thesis)
- Problem: 2-5 year process with millions of dollars to figure out biological processes
- Solution: Turn 2 years into couple weeks using AI models
- Bayesian optimizations for data collection
	- Large sampling window to understand 100+ possible parameters in cell culture systems
	- Metabolic screening with different cell culture media components
	- Probes central metabolism vs just monitoring yield/cell growth
	- Provides behavior predictions across different reactor systems
- Scaling capabilities
	- Lab goes up to 50L (city limit)
	- Partnerships with CDMOs across Europe
	- CDMOs transfer data from 35m³ reactor systems back to Bioqore at no cost
- Advanced modeling approach
	- Combination of digital twin simulation + lab validation
	- Creates “fingerprints” for scale-up behavior
	- Hybrid model: Bayesian neural models → probabilistic → predictive (ensemble approach)
	- Handles up to 10 objectives simultaneously (yield, titer, glycosylation, etc.)
	- Real-time corrections during manufacturing
	- Can identify genetic instability without sequencing cells

### Business Model & Fundraising

- Initial contracts with therapeutic companies for cash flow validation
- Primary model: Buy underperforming/low quality strains or data packages from pharma
	- Front capital to scale the process (6 month window)
	- Sell package back for 10-100x return
	- License deals worth $10-20M (vs typical acquisition costs)
	- If original company doesn’t buy back, sell to competition
- SaaS doesn’t work in pharmaceuticals (don’t like recurring subscriptions)
- Contract model provides linear growth, not hockey stick trajectory
- Current fundraising
	- Started 2 weeks ago after Y Fellows
	- Raising $2M at $10M post-money valuation
	- Half already secured and wired
	- Collecting SAFEs for remaining half
	- Possible oversubscription may raise post-money to $15M
	- Need more case studies before seed round
	- Plan to hire 1-2 ML people
- User interface for clients to upload/download data packages with full transparency
- Models are non-transferable to pharma companies for liability reasons

### Next Steps

- Bioqore to send detailed process document with case studies by end of day
- Bioqore to send go-to-market information on creative business model
- Virtue to review materials and respond within 24-48 hours
- Potential connection to Etre (Virtue’s biomanufacturing portfolio company)
