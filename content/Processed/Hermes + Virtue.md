### Deck Updates and Positioning

- Rejiggered presentation with key additions
	- Added “why now” slide (long-awaited)
	- Added deal terms to ask slide
	- Included customer logos with annualized revenue
	- Created competitive positioning grid vs CLO and Chartswell
- Positioning feedback from Virtue
	- Focus on infrastructure layer vs application companies
	- Get Codes Health as example - YC company becoming customer
	- Austin Mills (CTO) wants Hermes for Sonar and patient histories
	- Value prop: record retrieval infrastructure they don’t want to rebuild

### Revenue Momentum and Operations

- Current ARR: $126K (90%+ captured in last 60 days)
- November performance: all record retrieval from CZ Law
- December slowdown: CZ Law testing performance
- January breakthrough: CZ Law switching from Midwest Record Retrieval
	- 500 record requests per month incoming
	- Combined with Site Sonar requests
- January forecast: $25K conservative, potentially $35K
- Operations dashboard now live for tracking

### Fundraising Pipeline Status

- 45-day focus on closing $4M seed round
- Current pipeline status:

### Investor Outreach Strategy

- Torch introductions: LHV, Bessemer, Eniac, Inspired Capital
	- Bessemer conversation went best (Sophia immediately understood)
- Virtue pipeline coordination needed
	- Haystack and Seusso - still waiting for responses
	- 12 Below and others marked as passed/out of scope
	- New intros needed for 6 additional prospects
- Post-term sheet momentum strategy
	- Following up with previous “can’t decide before break” responses
	- Using Torch term sheet to push decision timelines

### Next Steps

- Alejandro: Update investor spreadsheet with pipeline status
- Alejandro: Send follow-up emails to all prospects (beginning of year)
- Virtue: Add new prospect names to spreadsheet and make introductions
- All: Coordinate JPM agenda and live meetings (Monday-Thursday)
- Virtue: Ping additional prospects who haven’t responded
