## Financing History

Finni has raised $4.1M to date in a variety of SAFEs. Major investors include GC ($2.35M), Forum Ventures ($0.65M), and YC ($0.5M).

## Investment Overview

We have the opportunity to double-down on our investment in [Finni Health](https://www.finnihealth.com) and lead their **$10M Series A round with an $8M check out of HAF 2.** As a reminder, we first invested in the team in March 2023 as part of the YC $100K program. The following month, we invested an additional $2.25M out of HAF 2 + Fund XI Ignition in a SAFE at a $20M valuation cap, bringing our total invested capital to $2.35M and 11.8% ownership.

As a reminder, Finni is enabling BCBAs (Board Certified Behavior Analysts) to go independent and start their own Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) practice. The company does this by taking on the administrative / back-office tasks associated with running a practice (e.g., payor contracting & credentialing, scheduling, maintaining compliance, billing & collections, staff management & payroll, etc.), in a similar manner to other 'business in a box' healthcare portfolio companies that we have (e.g., SonderMind for therapists, Fay for nutritionists). The company has also built its own all-in-one practice management EHR and is launching v1 of Orbit, its own data collection software for outcomes tracking. In exchange, Finni takes 37% of total practice billings. The way this works is a 27% take rate of all the billings for the software/marketing and another 10% for "factoring” the revenue (paying the providers upfront and collecting the revenue from the insurance carriers a few months later.). Providers love Finni because it also provides them with the initial capital, infrastructure and knowhow to get started establishing their own practice.

The company launched with its first practice owner in September 2022 and today is live with 18 practice owners across 13 states serving 200+ patients. The company is at $7.2M RR GMV (total practice billings, with ~75/25 Medicaid/Commercial), which translates to $2.6M RR net revenue (Finni's share based on its take rate). Gross margins are ~27% of GMV, and the company has been EBITDA positive for multiple months (and was EBITDA positive last year at ~5.6% of GMV).

Given their traction to-date, we anticipate that this will be a competitive round and were able to secure an early look given our existing relationship over the last year. This is a company and team that is highly aligned with our Health Assurance thesis and focused on a meaningful patient population in a space that has historically seen its fair share of bad actors largely from PE backed providers. We are excited that Finni is a story of empowerment and access for both patients and providers.

## Investment Thesis

*   **Mission-aligned, technical team that genuinely wants to improve how autism care is delivered in the US**: Bucky & Yilun are ambitious founders who are incredibly mission-driven and care deeply about delivering ABA therapy in the right way - for both patients and providers. Bucky's mom is a provider in the in-home care space and was her right hand person to do all things ops for her business growing up. This gave him enormous empathy for engaging with providers. Both founders bring a product mindset and a tech-first growth angle to healthcare (growth / performance marketing for Bucky; Shopify SWE for Yilun). As is no surprise to those in healthcare, autism care in the US is a sensitive topic - while reimbursement is widespread and oftentimes mandated, waitlists continue to be long, and a predominantly FFS environment has led to some abuse of the system (most notably among private equity players, as covered by the press). It is commonly reported that many ABA providers (BCBAs and RBTs) feel burned out and overworked. Now is the perfect time for a player who wants to do autism right to emerge.
*   **Impressive initial traction and product velocity, with good line of sight to 2024 projections**: The company has achieved a lot in its first 18 months from a commercial standpoint, product standpoint, and financial standpoint. Today, they have a backlog of 37 BCBAs who have already signed on as practice owners but have yet to be onboarded - this covers their projections through mid-summer, and to hit their EOY targets, they'll need to sign and onboard another ~70 BCBAs by the end of this year. Note that this includes both BCBAs who sign on as practice owners and BCBAs who join existing Finni practices. Given their pipeline conversion from the past year, these figures feel very achievable.
*   **Meaningfully large market with ability to establish initial market leadership**: It's estimated that there are ~55-65K BCBAs in the US, and the company's current average net revenue per BCBA is ~$150K. This is a market that can support one or multiple large outcomes without any individual needing to capture more than 10% of BCBAs. Additionally, unlike other areas like talk therapy or medical nutrition therapy, 'business-in-a-box' is still in early days for ABA therapy. Apart from Finni, [Tilly](https://www.tillyhealth.com/) (FKA Elemy), which is in our portfolio, is also doing this in select geographies, though a bigger part of their business today is helping schools staff their special ed programs. The only other similar model we found is [Headstart Health](https://www.headstart.health/), which is much earlier than either Tilly or Finni. As such, now is an ideal moment in time to grab early and meaningful market share with an innovative business model that we've seen work in other verticals.

When we first invested in February 2023, the company was at ~$1.1M RR GMV / $340K RR net revenue, with 2 live practices serving 29 patients. Just a year later in February 2024, the company has grown to ~$7.2M RR GMV / $2.6M RR net revenue (~80% gross margin), with 18 live practices serving 202 patients. They did this with 8 FT team members! Finni enables practices to accept both Medicaid and Commercial plans, opening up the aperture of types of patients that they can serve - today, ~75% of the business is Medicaid.

As can be seen above, the company has been incredibly efficient in this first year of growth, with gross profit in the ~20-30% range (off GMV) and positive EBITDA for most months last year. New practice owner acquisition has largely come through unpaid channels (e.g., inbound, referrals from existing owners, etc.), so their paid CAC is only ~$160. Furthermore, many of their current practices already have waitlists (due to payor referrals and Finni's own marketing playbook driving patient acquisition), which points to the supply-demand imbalance in the space and the need for increased capacity.

The team currently has 36 providers signed and ready to be onboarded, which is a key driving factor behind this raise - they've completely turned off top-of-funnel until they've onboarded this backlog.

As part of our diligence process, we spoke to three of their providers, and the feedback was outstanding; all three were feeling burnt out and on the verge of leaving the industry, but Finni has re-energized them, empowered even those who described as 'not business people,' and given them a chance at entrepreneurship in their local communities. Their first owner, Monique, in New Mexico has grown her practice to 7 BCBAs and 55 RBTs serving 80 kids - her practice single-handedly constituted $3.2M of GMV in February 2024, or 45% of Finni's total GMV. Note that we believe this concentration will decrease over time and highlight it as an example of what is possible on the Finni platform - all practices have grown substantially since first starting. See below for practice-level monthly GMV growth (note that there are some seasonal fluctuations around holidays, etc., which is expected with a business like this):

## Product & Tech Updates

This is a team that has demonstrated incredible product velocity and gotten up a steep learning curve in healthcare. As mentioned, they have their own in-house, purpose-built EMR for ABA therapy as well as an in-house outcomes tracking software, Orbit, which is being rolled out this year. Capabilities include:

*   Payor Contracting & Credentialing
*   Smart Scheduling
*   Compliance Audits
*   Automated Billing & Collections
*   Staff Management and Payroll
*   Real-Time Patient Data Tracking

Next on the product roadmap are three key areas:

*   Further billing automation as the company grows in scale and diversifies its payors
*   Recruiting support for practice owners (both RBTs and BCBAs) - this is a point that all practice owners brought up that they would like increased support with
*   Continued development of Orbit, their in-house tool for medical record creation and tracking of clinical quality & outcomes
*   Roll-out of a Parent Portal that will enable self-guided onboarding, provide a direct data feed from Orbit so parents can monitor care & progress, and allow for communication between families and the Finni team (expected launch in Q4 2024)

## Team Updates

The team has added two new leaders since the Seed:

*   **Nicola Brummer** joined the team in late 2023 as Head of Provider Success, bringing over a decade of experience in behavior analysis. She was a founding board member of the Association of Behavior Analysis in Florida and a sitting board member of the Iowa Association of Behavior Analysis, so she also has a grasp of where the market is today.
*   **Zeeshan Ahmed** joined the team early in 2024 as Head of BizOps after spending two years at Mighty Buildings (Head of Strategic Finance & Business Intelligence), where he oversaw the financial planning function and helped scale the company from 60 staff and 13 contracted houses to over 300 staff and 1,000 contracted houses in 2 years. Before Mighty Buildings, Zeeshan worked in various sell-side and buy-side finance roles.

With this round of funding, the team is also looking to bring on a Head of Clinical Operations and Head of Payor Operations - both of these searches are actively underway.

By the end of 2024, the company expects to have ~1.0K active patients, with RR GMV of $40M / RR net revenue of $15M. Assuming 8 patients per BCBA (pretty standard approximation), the company needs to have ~130 fully staffed BCBAs on the platform (either as practice owners or as part of Finni practices). We are confident in the team's ability to hit these 2024 numbers from a provider volume perspective. The team currently has 18 BCBA practice owners and 12 BCBAs under practice owners for a total of 30 BCBAs today. As mentioned above, they have another 36 that are signed and ready to be onboarded - once fully onboarded, this should cover their volume forecasts through August 2024. The company thus needs to sign ~65-70 more BCBAs - so far, their pipeline of 225 BCBAs has had a 'hit rate' of ~31% (aka providers who are active, signed, or have offers), so even at a lower hit rate of 20%, to achieve 70 more signed BCBAs, they would have to reach out to 350 new BCBAs. Given growing top-of-funnel wasn't even a priority last year and has been halted in recent months, we think this is a very achievable number. Note that this 'hit rate' does not include a category known as "reach out later" of 36 providers who expressed interest but at a later time.

We are also currently running a pulse survey of BCBAs to gauge interest in practice ownership. Of the 7 responses so far, 4 have thought about starting their own practice for clinical and personal autonomy; three of them have not been able to due to the time & investment required. The remaining who have not thought about it expressed hesitation with managing the business side. However, when presented with a blurb about a company like Finni, six of the seven respondents say they would be interested in being a practice owner with such support, with high enthusiasm for payor contracting & credentialing, billing & collections, modern EHR/PMS, and staff management services). There is clearly a strong market appetite for a company like Finni.

We admittedly consider management's projections to be quite aggressive. For our returns case, we assume the following:

*   **$18M Series A at $100M post-money valuation**
    *   This implies 2024P entry multiples of 4.3x GMV, 11.8x Net Revenue, and 15.1x Gross Profit (all management case off of a $82M pre) - all of which we consider fair entry multiples
    *   GC new investment of $12M, for 12% new money ownership after the round
*   Before exit, we assume an additional **30% dilution** - note that we consider this to be a high assumption, as the company is already cash flow positive and we don't anticipate that many additional funding rounds. We'd like to explore partnering with CVF for future sales & marketing needs and other debt providers fund the "factoring" part of the product offering.
*   Instead of forecasting a P&L, we lay out what GC's new money returns profile might look like at different market share capture levels and implied financial scale of the business at those market share levels, given key business assumptions:
    *   **# Patients per BCBA:** The Council of Autism Service Providers has a recommended caseload of 6-12 patients per supervising BCBA; we have chosen the midpoint of this at around 8 (also what Finni's management assumes on the low end of maximum caseload)
    *   **Annual GMV per Patient:** February's implied annual GMV per patient was ~$36K, which is what we use in our returns analysis. Note that Finni's ARPU assumption (net revenue) is $150K, which at a caseload of 8 patients, implies ~$50K annual GMV per patient, so we are conservative here.
    *   It is important for us to not rely on overbilling patient hours as a key lever for this business - for reference, our ~$36K per patient corresponds to ~8-10 hours per week of direct therapy over 45 weeks of the year, and Finni's ~$50K per patient corresponds closer to ~12-15 hours. The recommended range for children with ASD is high (10-40 hours is what's commonly cited), so both these fall on the lower end.
    *   **Gross Profit as % Net Revenue:** This was ~83% in 2023 and stabilized in the low 80%s over time in management case, but we have brought this down to 75% to reflect additional support that Finni may provide over time.
*   We also lay out GC's returns at **two different take rates** given that we believe take rates will erode over time - we have shown returns at 37% (today's rate) and 20% (a heavily discounted rate).

At a 10x GP multiple (implies a 1.5-3x GMV, multiple depending on Finni's take rate) and Finni capturing 3% market share (~2K BCBAs, which we think is very reasonable), our base case of a discounted take rate implies a gross return for GC's Series A investment of $60M and 6.0x MOIC. The upside case of Finni's current take rate implies a gross return for GC's Series A investment of $111M and 11.1x MOIC.

For reference, for our recent Fay Series A follow-on, we assumed an exit ARR multiple of 5.0x and exit GP multiple of 16.7x; for our SonderMind Series C investment, we assumed an exit revenue multiple of 3.0x and exit GP multiple of 8.6x. We believe the 10x GP multiple that we use above is a reasonable middle ground between these prior exit assumptions.

We are assuming a 7% ESOP top-up in the pre for the team as it grows.

## Key Risks

*   **Downward pressure on payor rates and Finni's take rate**: Today, Finni has very standard contracts with Medicaid & Commercial payors. We are still diligencing this point, but from initial conversations, it seems highly unlikely that payor rates on a per unit basis (e.g., reimbursement per hour of direct therapy) will come down - one payor that we spoke to believes per unit rates will increase alongside inflation. However, it is possible that the aggregate amount of reimbursement decreases as payers implement tighter utilization management measures given historical overbilling by PE providers in the space. We are not concerned about this, as Finni's model has never been to help BCBAS maximize per child reimbursement - from a mission alignment standpoint, the team is focused on providing the right type and quantum of care. Additionally, as Finni grows in target markets and continues to track quality & outcomes, the team may even be able to command premium rates (not baked into any of our scenarios today). It's worth noting that the team is very upfront that they don't have "formal" relationships with payors today, especially given how much of their book is Medicaid - this is an area that they are excited to partner with GC on and get more sophistication around.

    On take rate, its current rate of 37% is at the high end of what we see with these types of businesses, and we almost certainly expect this to erode over time. In our returns section, we talk about the impact of a significantly lower take rate and believe Finni can still become a large outcome with a lower percentage. Additionally, the team has proven itself to be excellent at shipping high-quality, customer-delighting product, and there are many additional areas that its product can expand into (e.g., RBT recruitment, physical clinic location scouting & financing, etc.) that can allow the team to continue to prove out its value prop and maintain a higher take rate in the market.

*   **ABA is still a crowded competitive landscape, especially on the provider supply side**: Whether it's legacy PE-owned players or the more tech-enabled VC-backed ones, there are no shortage of ABA therapy providers that directly employ BCBAs and RBTs and thus would compete with Finni for this workforce. Additionally, it's also possible that there will be fast followers who replicate Finni's model after seeing the attractive market opportunity, which would add further competition to the market. The team will need to closely monitor provider acquisition cost over time, but in our mind, this is a large enough market, Finni does not need to capture an extraordinary amount to be a large business, and the company even sits in an interesting position where one area of expansion is into workforce development and new provider training to grow the overall workforce.

*   **Non-healthcare-native team that is still lean and will need to hire thoughtfully for this next phase**: This has been an incredibly scrappy team of 8 FTEs to-date, which likely explains how they have been so efficient and EBITDA positive already. As they continue to get deeper in healthcare, we would likely want to see them add more healthcare expertise to the executive team. Bucky & Yilun are actively working on Head of Clinical Operations and Head of Payor Operations searches - both of these have late-stage candidates that the team is excited about, and we are looking forward to helping them with these new team members.

## Responsible Innovation

### Is the founder's mindset aligned with RI Values and RL Principles?

*   Bucky & Yilun are among the most RI-aligned founders that we've met. They both care deeply about serving kids with autism in the most ethical way possible and formed the company after talking to hundreds of BCBAs about their experiences. Furthermore, they have chosen to serve all payor types, including Medicaid, which has lower reimbursement rates than Commercial, because they care deeply about access in this space where waitlists are historically long.
*   By enabling BCBAs to start their own practices, Finni is the ultimate story of empowerment and allowing BCBAs to leave workplaces where they historically have been burned out. Instead, they can provide care in the way they want to (without worrying about admin items), to families in their local communities while creating safe places to work for their practice staff.

### Describe the company's potential for societal impact, if any?

*   Today, 1 in 36 children are diagnosed with autism, but there is an extreme staffing shortage in the industry that leads to waitlists of up to 2 years for those seeking care. In an attempt to extract as much profits as possible, PE-backed providers often maximize billable hours of their staff and overwork them to the point of burnout. Finni has the opportunity to reverse this trend by enabling more BCBAs to stay in the field, grow their practices, and ultimately serve all the kids in the US who deserve care.

### Describe the possible negative unintended consequences to any stakeholder (Stakeholders include employees, customers, consumers, suppliers, investors, local communities, governments, regulators, the planet, etc.)

*   In the worst case scenario, Finni goes the way of PE players in this space who have taken the route of overbilling and extracting as much reimbursement as possible from payers at the expense of their staff and without monitoring of clinical need. This would happen if we push the company to growth at the expense of everything else and would lead to staff burnout, mismanagement of patients, lack of continuity of care (as staff drop out), among other negative consequences.

### What ongoing risk mitigation measures can and will GC deploy?

*   We are highly aligned with the company on how to build this company responsibly, and our exit case does not require Finni to maximize reimbursement per patient - instead, their growth will come through adding additional providers to the platform and creating software that best enables them.
*   With that being said, GC will take a Board seat to make sure governance is aligned at the top level going forward. We will also work with the company to create a metrics dashboard that includes KPIs like practice owner NPS, staffed BCBA/RBT NPS, average billable hours per patient (to notice any upward trends), etc. that we can track together over time.

    *   Given the scope of work and limited career opportunities, I would hesitate to recommend ABA as a career path.
    *   Working in the field is not only rewarding but there are endless opportunities for work. There are school, home, clinic and inpatient/outpatient opportunities.
    *   It is one of the few careers where you can start your own clinic with just a masters degree. Also, the hours are very flexible.
    *   It is a great field that's always advancing. You're able to use science to make interventions and track progress for client, but have the ability to be creative in how you get to those end goals.
    *   It's a perfect mixture for using concrete evidence-based practices while being creative with how you present things to clients. The caveat is that typically, you need to abide by insurance standards and requirements which can be frustrating, as they seem to consistently make it harder to get treatment approved. Insurance companies also don't keep up with the standards in the field or the standards of the BACB.
    *   ABA is such a versatile approach to teaching and the progress you are is so rewarding
    *   Changing lives everyday!
    *   I love what I do, enjoy the field as a whole and the position/job changes on a daily basis. Just today was talking to a student and recommended obtaining their BCBA.
    *   The career can be extremely rewarding; however, the expectations for billable hours and cookie cutter approaches to ABA can be disheartening and difficult.
    *   It is a very rewarding career, with a lot of job opportunities
    *   My opinion may be biased because being a BCBA is my literal dream job. I'm passionate about problem solving and serving people with disabilities. This field is great for someone who wants to make a significant difference in someone else's life.
    *   It's a great career and pays well.
    *   It is a science-based, effective discipline and you can see the effects relatively quickly in many children/families.
    *   I think it can be rewarding yet trying at times.
    *   The field has many pros, including helping others, making an impact, flexibility, and income potential. However, working with insurance and inconsistent hours are cons.
    *   The job itself is very rewarding when you make progress with your clients. I have seen a tremendous amount of growth in my clients and I have been able to make their lives more independent. I feel a tremendous amount of pride in the work that I do. However, there is a large amount of administrative responsibilities that take time away from clinical work and make being a clinician very difficult. It is often times difficult to have a work balance.
    *   I highly recommend ABA as a career path, as it is very rewarding and has lasting effects for individuals served. I only selected an 8 because I would not recommend it for everyone.
    *   I find it to be an extremely rewarding career, however it comes with its challenges and it's not for everyone. Seeing the outcomes produced by ABA therapy is wonderful and reinforcing, which keeps me in the field. You need to have a love for it though, or it wouldn't be the best career for you.
    *   It is a field designed to help others. For someone looking to do so, it provides an evidence-based approach to teaching and learning. For a BCBA level provider there are also opportunities to earn a good living in the field which can differ from other human/social services (e.g. social worker, teacher, etc.).
    *   I do love the field but feel there is a limit to growing opportunities within working with children.
    *   The field has changed tremendously in the 20 years I have been a BCBA. There is a lot of involvement and control from other entities (insurance, investors, business administrators) that have very little knowledge or perspective on the principles and clinical practices of ABA. As a practitioner, I am finding it increasingly difficult to provide high quality services due to the barriers created by these other entities. Training new staff becomes very difficult because of the high prioritization of billable versus non-billable work. This leads to staff providing services before they are appropriately trained.
    *   I love what I do for a living. Seeing the progress and changes in a child's behavior has been one of the most rewarding aspects of my career. I also love that we are based in science so there is literature to back up what we do versus just going by someone's word.
    *   It is a challenging job, but very rewarding.
    *   Rewarding work, but demand is high and stress can be high too.

*   Have you ever thought about starting your own practice?
    *   16 Yes's
        *   I am not anymore. Too much work and I need work life balance
        *   Private ownership means I would have clinical autonomy, cap on caseload size, decision on which locations to work (<15 miles from home), increased pay. But it's too confusing to navigate
        *   I have already started my own practice back in 2022. I was interested because I was frustrated with clinic owners who are not in the ABA field treating my RBTs poorly, and also telling other BCBAs how to do their job.
        *   Being able to design best practices is something I want to do and to define key initiative, but requires too much capital up front
        *   To sell later and prepare for retirement, but would need capital as I would never entertain private equity.
        *   I am an ABA practice owner.
        *   I would be able to provide more clinical guidance/framework and work to improve the quality of services provided, but it requires too much money.
        *   My own practice would give me the ability to make my own rules, practice my own values, and not get tied up in decisions being made for profit over people. However, I don't think I have enough experience as a BCBA yet, or the finances to do this.
        *   Making my own rules, but I don't have enough time.
        *   Freedom and need
        *   In order to have more freedom in terms of how to practice, staffing, etc and earning potential as a business owner. But it is very time consuming, credentialing is lengthy
        *   I would consider starting my own practice to have more control over the quality of services being provided to my patients. However, starting your practice is far too expensive. The ever-changing insurance laws make it too challenging to navigate.
        *   There are not enough service providers, or high-quality providers, in my local area and with my experience and past leadership positions, I believe I'm able to provide high-quality services to my local community. I did start my own practice 1.5 years ago. It has been challenging to secure capital to start/maintain the business.
        *   There are currently not enough services for children with autism. The vast majority of. clinics have waitlists. that are 12-24. months long. Families need help now. With my background in the field, and 4 years as a clinical director, i have the tools to be able to successfully start a business. I created my own business January 2024. I am still working for my current company until I have been fully credentialed and have clients starting. At which point I will be stepping away and only working for my company.
        *   I have considered it since I do not believe many agencies run their practice ethically. A lot of businesses have opened just to optimize hours and income versus quality of care. I would like to work with other populations, such as adults or teens and there aren't many practices that target that near me. However, it will probably be confusing to navigate, would have to find people I trust and know the field.
        *   To be my own boss. To have more freedom in the choices I make in my career, but requires time and knowledge that I haven't acquired yet. A bit of anxiety.
    *   9 No's
        *   BCBAs shouldn't be agency owners. We're clinicians and need investors and other financially organized entities to manage an agency in terms of administration. BCBA owned companies without outside admin tend to fold.
        *   I am not interested because of the business side of having your own business. I like to go to work and then go home and have that separation between work and school.
        *   The nuances that come with it seem to be too much to handle. Having to take into consideration credentialing for staff, marketing, ability to consistently keep clients, and abiding by best business practices seems daunting.
        *   I am a university professor who works for a public university. I direct an on-campus clinic and have no interest in starting my own business
        *   It's very hard to compete with other practices and it's very stressful. There is also a lot of fraud in the field
        *   The business side of owning my own practice does not interest me.
        *   Navigating the landscape of credentialing and insurance funded services seems daunting and frustrating based on my experience. The quality of potential Behavior Therapists and the ability to retain staff is also a barrier to creating and maintaining a quality ABA practice.
        *   I do not do well with the business side of owning a practice. I could do the clinical side and the employee-manager side fine. I also have zero experience in navigating the credentialing aspect of insurance (all the locations I have been at have had specialized departments that handled the insurance steps/credentialing/authorizations etc).
        *   I have young children and a lot going on in my personal life.

*   Let's say a company could make it easier for you as a BCBA to go independent and start your own practice by taking care of many of the administrative/back-office tasks associated with running an independent practice. In exchange, the company would take a percentage of your total billings. Would you want to receive services from a company like this?

## Appendix - Finni Provider Calls

### Lexie Walters (BCBA)

*   **Intro**
    *   Have been in field of ABA since she turned 18
    *   Was a broke college kid that needed a good job and ABA paid well
    *   Fell in love with it - changed career trajectory to be ABA
    *   Worked as a technician and then BCBA - as a BCBA, got to see a lot more of the ins and outs in terms of how ABA worked with insurance, families, etc.
    *   Saw a lot of great things and a lot of things that were ethically questionable - things she wasn't comfortable doing and didn't want to be a part of
    *   Reached a point in her career where she was either going to leave the field of ABA or commit and do it herself - knew she could do it better or do it differently
    *   Like an angel from the heavens, Bucky came and sent her a message
        *   Connected through Indeed at first - was pretty active on her profile and Bucky sent her a message
*   **What resonated the most in his outreach to you?**
    *   Bucky was incredibly relatable - that was one of the biggest things - in that very first introductory message - he was very personable and seemed to get it and in a very different way - he is addressing it on SW side and support and empower us - but he still had Mo and others that he was willing to listen to and be that person
    *   Huge difference between him and other messages I was getting
*   **Were you thinking about starting your own practice?**
    *   Had that idea, but if I had done that, my husband would have murdered me - there was no way we could have put the capital into that, and I am not a business person - would not hae known what to do - was doing hours and hours of research but was kind of defeated
*   **Walk us through the journey**
    *   Got to connect with Bucky first and did a Zoom call together to have that face with it - it was funny because was maybe the fifth practice owner to sign on so there weren't many reviews so thought it was a scam
    *   Met with Mo as well and really hit it off
    *   Said we'll give it a try, and low downside if it doesn't work out (b/c they weren't asking for money from her)
    *   Credentialing was the biggest pain and it is for everyone, but the team was really good about using different SW and systems to make her as informed with the process so she knew the efforts they were putting in as well
    *   Things she did was build personal face-to-face connections in the state
    *   Then once got credentialed, it was just a whirlwind - first week had 2 clients b/c they were twins and within 3 months, we were at 20-25 clients and now have 30 kids - have been with Finni for 6 months. When got to 25, had to hire another clinician, so had a bit of a slowdown, but have continued to get referrals
        *   Have been able to travel back and forth to New Mexico and work with Mo
        *   Empowered Lexie to create her own curriculum with training she was doing for Mo's team
        *   2 of them are personal connections that she had brought before - 1 didn't know they were coming to me but saw Finni and came over and knew she had served them before; it was a lot of really good advertising - the name / brand is new and cool and eye-catching (vs. outdated presentations of new providers)
        *   2 BCBAs (including herself) and 10 RBTs - majority fo RBTs are also full time (which is something that not a lot of places have)
*   **What are your career aspirations**
    *   Already in so many ways, we have hit what I would consider success - we have families that are happy, client outcomes that are great, awesome relationships with payers b/c have hda really high compliance and passed all audits and things like that. In so many ways, just having those happy individuals and seeing progress with kids is so much success
    *   Being able to continue and expand that offering - would like to continue expanding and providing to families as they reach out
    *   Part of the stop gap is her - so wants to take on more clinicians
*   **Which parts of Finni experience have you loved most to date**
    *   If you were talking about experience today - she did supervision this morning and got to go to a client's house and jump on trampoline and focus on learning and being a clinician and didn't have to sit back here and work on billing, HR, etc. - was able to focus on her and be present and in doing that, she gets to do so many fun things every day and work hands on with staff instead of worrying about back-end stuff
        *   Individual she saw today is out of network, hard to do billing, and Finni said we got you
*   **What feedback are you giving them**
    *   They give me such a big head - there's always these small things that pop up - as with anything that's new, little tweaks or changes that need to be made to SW - and they are on it about fixing those things. One of the biggest parts of their feedback coming on was that a lot of the system SW were made for TriCare-specific as a payer or Commercial payers. Michigan Medicaid payers are a whole different game and they are so different and so challenging. And I've worked with so many companies that don't have a good way to address is and are still using pen & paper - sending in billing that way through fax, etc. So this was a big chunk of the feedback I was giving them - this is still kind of a bulky process for me, and then Yilun said he got it and he completely revolutionized how we do billing for Medicaid here.
        *   The contract part of that - she was not involved too much - gave as much information and then they really ran with that and provided that to individual payers - they follow up regularly. As far as submitting authorization requests, they've been amazing at supporting her through that. Also, they would tell you that I am one of those people who says she'll do it herself - so she'll do it before they get a chance to help her. Once we get kids on and get that authorization in place, that's kind of it for me. Take care of all the billing on back end - provide notes for all sessions and they submit that for payers - they worry about following up on claims, payouts, etc.
    *   Anything I come to them with they said - we got you
*   **What do they do on quality**
    *   Like how everyone has their own team - right now the team is smaller and so it's a lot of the same people and same success staff for everybody
    *   Having designated team has allowed them to really focus in on different areas they're comfortable in - e.g., Crystal is really good with credentialing, so that's her main focus, and she makes sure my staff are all credentialed and ready to go - she makes sure I'm good with authorizations, I'm in network, etc. Z really focuses on is Lexi able to take on another BCBA right now.

### Monique Lujan (BCBA)

*   **Intro**
    *   Feel like Bucky and Yilun both fell out of the sky
    *   Started out in the field from entry level - BT then RBT then BCBA. Started at the very bottom and fell in love with the field. As a BCBA, start understanding the burnout - you're in a field that takes a lot of mental capacity - you want to be support system for families and using ABA techniques. Worked for local company and then in Chicago. Started understanding how important culture was and that companies weren't doing it the right way. Were just using what she could do to make more money for the company
    *   She was about to leave field and then Yilun fell out of the sky - had a really good 45 min chat about what they were thinking about. And for anything in this field, she was like is this a scam. But it felt sincere and said let's do this.
*   **Were you thinking about starting your own practice?**
    *   Was already thinking about leaving the field b/c not able to be empowered herself. Finni empowered her to do that - it takes a lot of money to start own practice and operational complexity is very difficult. In order for me to be successful, knew had to have a very complex plan to do that
*   **Walk us through journey**
    *   It's been a year and a half - one of the fastest growing ABA companies in New Mexico right now. Get chills when I think about it
    *   The clinical care we've been able to provide to the community has been really incredible
    *   Journey of empowerment for herself has been great personally but also for her community
    *   Finni has been able to help with admin side to enable her to grow
*   **She is now at 80 - got 20 on the waitlist**
    *   It is insane to be able to say that growth - no way I would have been able to do that by myself because billing and credentialing is aversive to me. I will do anything but that
*   **How has Finni helped you so far and where you give them feedback**
    *   Biggest thing for me has been the systems - when you talk about the platforms - the PMS has been from day 1 to now has helped significantly. One of the things - ABA is all about data. For us, we want to objectify anything. Talk to Yilun all the time.
    *   Can spend saved time on onboarding more families, culture aspect of the business, etc. and retention
    *   Contract side of it is outside of our hand - in New Mexico, Finni and myself have worked on developing relationships with these case managers on insurance side where we're able to get things going a lot faster. That's something that using that process in more states
    *   And then giving them insight on systems - e.g., having safeguards in place, etc.
*   **How do you ensure protocols, quality is high when you're not seeing kids yourself**
    *   It's the culture - when people feel respected and heard, they follow. And they lead
    *   Everyone is in this field b/c they love what they do - it's not about the money. When Mo is empowered, I can empower others. And by doing that, the quality of care is higher
    *   Does pulse checks with BCBAs, RBTs, etc. - e.g., send happy birthday message when child has a birthday. And then do random Slack channel engagements.
*   It's a combo of BTs and RBTs - have 55 BTs and RBTs and 7 BCBAs currently at case load of 8-10 - depends on severity of the child. And then have one part time admin staff member / RBT - she's doing a dual role - want to highlight that b/c any company (ABA company) that has 80 families on there - you will need an operations director - clinical director - and right now b/c PMS does such a good job, just need an admin staff
    *   My whole background led me to this path - she was an ABA recruiter, and those processes have been passed along to other BCBA owners as well - she does it in house and is able to find staff fairly quickly (Indeed, Facebook, Insta, other platforms)
        *   Finni can probably provide that assistance down the road
    *   She also does training in-house - doesn't take too much time
*   **What other SW tools do you use?**
    *   Used to be a Google Drive person but with PMS, it's all in there
    *   Developed PMS together with Finni - why do we need this, why does this make sense
*   **How do you tell friends about Finni**
    *   They said this is too good to be true -
    *   Thinks the future of ABA - some companies aren't doing it right. Finni is doing it right - they're empowering BCBAs
*   **Finni charges you**
    *   ~30% - been like that since the beginning
*   **How much do they help you bring in new families**
    *   The system does it because families can go to Finni's website and gets linked to our PMS - so Finni having that side of it - but as far as referrals, that's a lot of organic referrals that have been coming in from WoM, dropping off flyers, etc. So a combination of all of those
*   They are the fastest growing ABA provider in NM - think second to another nationwide company but are right there b/c are branching out everywhere
*   **Why would someone say no to working with Finni**
    *   Skeptical
    *   This field causes a lot of trauma b/c you get taken advantage a lot when you love what you do
*   **Do you chat often with other providers on Finni network?**
    *   Another thing I was worried about when I wanted to branch out on my own - as a clinician, you won't know everything - autism is a spectrum, this is an ever-changing field. So was worried that she wasn't able to engage with other practitioners. But at Finni, speaks daily with multiple BCBAs on the Finni platform, chatting with each other, what practices work best.
*   **Need a clinic in the future?**
    *   Clinics can get filled up very quickly - for myself, running a clinic is something that would be key. She loves in-home services - being able to provide services in the home are key but running a clinic is something that many practice owners have also said as well
    *   The biggest thing is on the contracting side b/c need to send addresses - b/c if I'm doing that on my own, it takes a lot longer processes - that's where Finni would provide that assistance - having to change all the addresses on the insurance side
*   **Did you explore any other alternatives to Finni?**
    *   No - didn't even think of something like this and when Bucky and Yilun chatted with me, thought it was a genius idea - didn't know why anyone else hadn't thought of it
    *   Had not and don't think she ever will
*   One thing for me is that empowerment - had been burned out. She's not the only one who feels this way and has heard other stories

### Kaylyn Weber (BCBA)

*   Heard about Finni through Indeed and then did her own research and thought it was too good to be true
*   Started credentialing in Aug and started seeing clients in January
*   She's been in ABA for 10 years, BCBA for 4 years
    *   Climate of the field: lots of practitioners who are very burnt out. Common trend of people leaving in first five years and she was there.
*   Two things she was considering: do I open my own practice and learn everything ro do I completely leave the field - and opening my own business didn't seem too feasible and Finni said you don't even need the capital to start your own business
*   Had a leap of faith to join Finni
*   Part of what took so long is I am the first provider in my state, so they were still figuring out group contracts for my state in particular. And then part of it was me being nervous to leave my job without a full caseload - she was credentialed with major payer back in October but was nervous to make the job until had a waitlist - but was also scared to put name out there b/c was working FT for another company - so then she said on the first of the year, I'm done
*   She has more kids than she can serve right now
    *   Right now has 5 active clients and have a waitlist of 13 clients
    *   Two clients came with her from previous company and then 3 are on her waitlist
    *   TriCare: if you let them know that you're open to clients, they'll refer. And then she ran some FB ads, etc.
*   She has been very transparent with people on her waitlist - they understand that there's a difference between big box ABA players and smaller place. And so a lot of them are okay to wait. She hasn't hired staff yet - she's been picky and it's hard to hire people and doesn't want to hire staff she doesn't trust.
    *   I've never hired before I got to this, so in some ways, Finni could possibly provide me more resources just to go about that in a more efficient way - was just talking to Bucky and nikola - it would be nice if Finni did some pre-screening for me
    *   She's billing 33.5 hours a week and then on top of that trying to screen candidates / interview people who don't show up
    *   She's doing both BCBA and RBT roles
*   Hasn't had a single client cancellation in six weeks
    *   Have had clients who are canceling between 10-20% of sessions and are not getting talked to by a company until in that 15-20% range. So most companies expect a 15% cancellation rate
*   Feedback to the Finni folks
    *   Main feedback has been really positive and so thankful that they've provided a good system. Main constructive feedback was around how long credentialing is taking (not in contract with all payers she's hoping to be in contract with)
        *   The only other main payer she was hoping to be in network with was BCBS - there are a few of their MCOs in the area that are just really easy to work with
        *   Also work with TriCare - which is notoriously difficult to work with
        *   The main impact is just the payer requirements - different payers require different level of documentation and level of assessment for each kid - some of them say you can bill for treatment planning vs. being able to bill once - so some of them are easier to work with
*   5-10 years from now - would love to have a clinic and wraparound services (speech, OT) - so people aren't having to get involved with multiple companies
    *   Would also love if able to have a daycare, preschool connected (to help FT working parents who have to manage schedules)
*   Think a physical clinic would be a few years down the road - owning a physical building creates a whole new host of challenges so would like to feel confident in her home-based services first
*   If I'm being honest, 30-35% feels really fair. If I grow and that 30% grows, I wonder if at some point I'm paying them more than what I'm getting from them - I'm paying them such a low fee compared to what I get out of them
*   Finni is putting in a lot of new stuff and resources - like a new person to the team about Zeeshan - who has more of business background and walked Kaylyn through financial & business things - so if they continue adding resources like that to pay that higher price
*   **What is sentiment from peers who decided to go independent?**
    *   Everybody tells me how stressful it is - that's what I was prepared for when I started with Finni
    *   But now I'm the least stressed out I've ever been - I have great WLB, kids are making great progress
    *   Some people don't want responsibility of being a practice owner
*   **How do you go about maintaining quality**
    *   A lot of it is about maintaining balance between billable time and nonbillable time - giving staff enough of nonbillable time to further education and they are developing a greater passion for the field
        *   I don't even know if you can quantify the right ratio - really considering each case will have different aspects in terms of billable vs. nonbillable
        *   And then communicate with insurance when you need more billable time
        *   Last company had us so jam-packed with kids that even if kid needed extra supervision, you couldn't use it b/c you couldn't serve and then utilization is low
        *   In billable hours, getting what you can done and then considering okay how much material does this specific client need, how competent am I on this kid or do I need to spend more time research / leaning to adequately treat this client
    *   When you're just working billable time, you get burnt out and you're not progressing at all
    *   So treating staff like professionals that they are and get that development - that's one way you can ensure quality stays high
    *   Even as a practice owner, my case load will dwindle and I'll still be present with families

### Logan Rice (BCBA)

Logan Rice is currently a Board Certified Behavior Analyst at Grow With Us Behavior Consulting (01/2023-Present). He is also currently a District Board Certified Behavior Analyst at Soliant Health, Inc. (02/2023-Present). Grow With Us Behavioral Consulting works with work with children and adolescents with Autism implementing ethical and accurate interventions performed by highly skilled Board Certified Behavior Analysts and Behavior Therapists. Soliant is a provider of specialized healthcare staffing services to hospitals, schools, and other healthcare providers. Prior to this role, he was a BCBA at Total Care ABA Therapy (03/2022-03/2023).

*   thrilled to be in the space as a BCBA; he's worked as an RBT and now as a BCBA for 6 years. Loves mentoring young BCBAs encouraging young adults to become one.
*   was very pleased to talk about his craft and market to an investor.
*   chronic shortage of BCBAs. This won't change for a while. More kids get diagnosed than ever before. Why? Most likely because the diagnostic methods + Dr. Google are now better/more accessible.
*   Loves his current employer as there isn't much pressure on doing shady stuff with billing (e.g. only take serious cases, overbilling, etc). PE firms owning companies in the space are tough employers.
*   He has ~7 cases himself and ~40 he is overseeing as the clinical director. Team of 4 BCBAs and some other more junior providers.
*   Post covid, seeing patients from home + inhome BCBA providers flourished. They are here to stay.
*   Many BCBAs are moving on from the field due to bad employers. He thinks the rate of folks going independent is the same.
*   It's hard to go independent. High upfront costs. Need to figure out medical billing, credentialing, hiring, training, marketing, maintaining high quality of service. Not easy.
*   In dense large cities there are more providers and more employment options for BCBAs.
*   Tricare sucks. Tedious to deal with all their requirements and they don't pay much.
*   Most patients are on medicare either for primary or secondary insurance. Some times there is a co-pay too.
*   United, BCBS, Aetna, etc. are all strong; they pay the highest rates.
*   There are differences in operating in different states as a BCBA.
*   They have a system in house to make sure the quality of care is similar across the various BCBAs they have in house.
*   He was a BCBA in SF before and it was really bad as he had to drive to various families' homes. He spent so much time on the road; stuck in traffic. With telehealth this isn't an issue.
*   You can make a good living as BCBA. If you start your own biz it might take you 6-12 months till you see your first patient... and you need a salary to survive till then.
*   You'd need a coach/mentor (with an MBA) to teach you what it takes to build a new business. Recruiting, mentoring talent, etc. is hard! One doesn't learn this stuff when they become a BCBA.

### Chelsea Moore (BCBA)

Chelsea Moore is currently serving as a Clinical Manager at Easter Seals Bay Area California (09/2022-Current). Previous rolls include: Lead BCBA at Centria Healthcare (03/2019-09/2022), Senior Consultant (9/2016-09/2019) at Butterfly Effects and as a BCBA at Centria Healthcare (March 2029-Present). In both roles she works to provide ABA services to children with autism. Prior to this she worked ABA Clinical Supervisor (10/2017-April 2019) at Family Insight and as a Clinical Manager (5/2015-9/2016) at Easter Seals California, both are providers of services for individuals and families living with autism and other development disorders. She is an experienced BCBA with over 7 years practicing in California, Louisiana, Virginia and New Mexico.

*   she works for a non profit owned facility today
*   loves that she doesn't have the pressure to bill a lot more because she works for a non-profit owned facility.
*   many of her peers are leaving the field as they are "forced" to bill a lot more... and do a number of unethical things (e.g. turn down patients, focus on patients who need a lot more help, overbill patients that don't need as much help, etc.).
*   they have PhDs working for them who analyze the quality of their work and determine clinical outcomes.
*   tricare is the worst insurance; pays the least. Commercial insurance pays $15-20 more per hour than what medicare or tricare do. Most patients are on medicare though.
*   Supply constrained... especially in sparsely populated areas. She hasn't thought much re: starting her biz due to lack of capital, insurance cost, legal complexities, she'd need help with recruiting and $ / help with marketing to new patients.
*   working from home isn't as great re: comparing notes with colleagues or seeing your patients more often (especially as they do work with RBTs and others). Insurance companies charge the same for in-home and at-healthcare facility work.
*   she encourages young talent to study and become ABAs. Great field with bright prospects (due to the chronic under-supply).
*   certain states are more friendly to get started and launch a practice she's heard.
*   getting credentialed via insurance carriers takes 2-3 months. The worst case she's heard is 8 months' wait.
*   consolidation continues in the industry; small clinics get scooped up by larger ones.
*   New England, CA, NYC is where ABAs can make the most $.
*   NYC rules are the trickiest for ABAs to navigate / launch their new practice.
*   alongside her team she works with 40 kiddos now directly. She has some assistants (not RBTs) who help her out with some of the work.
*   A lot of the work she does is outside of billable hours too.

### Kelly Collins (BCBA)

Kelly Collins is a Board Certified Behavior Analyst at Brighter Strides ABA Therapy, which provides ABA therapy services for individuals diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (11/2021-Present). Formerly, Kelly served as Clinical Director for Early Autism Services, which provides individualized ABA therapy to children with autism and their families living across the United States, Canada and Australia (06/2019-11/2021).

*   10 BCBAs when she started in Nov 2021 and now is 35 BCBAs now at her location, 150 Behavior technicians, Maryland
*   hasn't started it; privately owned, PE equity owned (she didn't know). 4 locations in the U.S. They collaborate with folks from the other locations.
*   quality standards --> she has an assistant clinical director --> every week they meet and review every patient's record. Talk to parents/patients/track the record monthly. Provide guidance to the BCBAs if they don't do great. 10-15h / week. Normally the convo goes well. Most people are receptive to feedback. Often meets BCBAs before the evaluation to receive their feedback on their approach first. Wants to give positive + corrective feedback.
*   hasn't thought about launching a new practice. why? (insurance guideline + keeping up with BACB standards as well). If you don't have $ to put upfront it's hard to recruit, train staff + market to patients.
*   Idk how much $ is required to do this. Doesn't know liability insurance stuff + salaries for other staff members.
*   A lot of need for more BCBAs. There is more demand than supply. Most companies have a waitlist of patients. Huge shortage in Maryland. A few unis added some coursework... so some more supply came in
*   Work remotely is hard to coordinate as a team. At a clinic setting you can get more hours and make more $; it's better for culture too. Many companies overbill to make more $.
*   Previous company of hers didn't want clients with less than 15h / week. Ethically it's a red flag.
*   She advises other young folks to pursue a career in ABA. It's a science. But there are several ways to get to the desired outcome. She loves the creativity required. She loves the ability to work remotely. Ditto for the flexibility on the schedule. She also loves that the science is new. Learning how to live your own life better; respond to behaviors.
*   People leave the field because of restrictions from the insurance companies. Getting stricter. They don't keep up with the research in the field... frustrating.
*   part-time case load up to 7 cases PT. FT 8-13 cases. Depends on the level of the child (how much support they need).
*   cancellation rate: the industry trying to figure it out. When RBTs cancel... they don't get paid. They do all the work. They do it more often. It's a hard job. They aren't paid fairly. BCBAs >> RBT in terms of pay (but it's because of the unbillable time). She was a tech for 8 years.. so she understands the burnout. Gotta check in with RBTs to make sure they don't feel burn out (e.g. remove them from a difficult case). Parents cancel due to sickness. That's fine.
*   she only knows of 1 person who started her own practice... she did over the last month.
*   you are seeing more people starting their own practice now. depends on the state + insurance. Varies drastically. Maryland is (or was a good one). 6 years ago there were 3-4 ABA companies. Now there are 24!. There is a high need in CA. It has a good payout rate. It's also an expensive place to live. Not sure if it's a good spot. Oregon doesn't pay out. Michigan is a good one. VA and NC are pretty good.
*   For a company to help you go independent: 1. upfront capital, 2. guidance around the legalities for state + federal requirements especially labor laws, 3. support for marketing, partnering with doctors, etc.
*   Maryland 70-80% are medicaid clients. It varies state to state. As soon as a kid gets diagnosed, medicaid covers everything. Tricare is a disaster (we have a lot of it due to military bases)- so hard to work with. Any BCBS, Aetna, United are all pretty good. Hasn't worked much with Humana. Paying out of pocket isn't feasible. Only for a short time... If they pay out of pocket... the focus is on training the parent to know what to do.
*   there are conferences, online communities, publications that ABAs attend/are part of/read and learn about what's happening in the industry

## Appendix - Payor Calls

### Yagnesh Vadgama (Magellan Health)

Yagnesh Vadgama is the Vice President of Clinical Care Services Autism at Magellan Health, leading for-profit managed health care company focused on behavioral healthcare (04/2016-Present). Prior, he was Clinical Supervisor at McRory Pediatrics, a pediatric therapy company based in Los Angeles (03/2013-05/2016). Before this, he was Clinical Manager at Beacon Health Options, a leading behavioral health company (05/2015-05/2016).

**Q1. Our client would like to speak with experts at payers who are familiar with ABA and their networks. Is this something you have experience with? If so, in what context? Please explain below.**
Response - Yes

Explanation - I have 20 years experience in ABA. In my current role I oversee 24 health plans across the country. This includes a wide range of ABA providers, their clinical approaches to ABA, outcomes, and trends in ABA providers.

**Q2. Please briefly describe your role at your current payer.**
Response - I own and oversee all matters related to ABA and autism, which includes network composition, innovation, VBC, partnerships, and outcomes.

**Q3. Can you speak to how payers like yours think about constructing your ABA therapy networks? Please briefly describe relevant experience.**
Response - Yes

Explanation - Yes. Building a network based on trends and clinical data/insights has been helpful for us to strategize how to build networks.

**Q4. Can you speak to how payers like yours think about cost and quality outcomes in ABA and how reimbursements may trend? Please briefly describe relevant experience.**
Response - Yes

Explanation - Within this area I can speak to my national and international involvement on quality, outcomes, and trends in reimbursement. I can also share trends on alternative payment models that are driving how to increase quality and look at reimbursement differently.

*   **Intro**
    *   BCBA by training and been in ABA for 11 years
    *   Has been on managed care side - oversees UM process for ABA providers nationally
    *   VP of Autism Care at Magellan - oversee clinical innovation, growth, strategy, etc.
        *   Growth initiatives, strategies related to VBC
    *   Work with a blend of Commercial, Medicaid, employer and federal plans - 26 plans (outsource management of network to Magellan - can be anything from network to full delegation - and then a number of health plans just do autism)
    *   Also President / CCO of California line of business - that includes upwards of 3M lives
*   **Bird's eye view**
    *   We have a mandate in all 50 states for fully insured plans to cover ABA benefit. Now that we have that and there's growing pressure across that for parity for health plans to cover ABA. What we have seen historically is as they start to go live with the mandate, health plans are unprepared from what it looks like from providers coming in and what they'll ask for. Providers ask for hours that don't meet medical necessity, but health plans don't have skill set to manage prior auth. So you see massive skewed data - some places are 100% higher utilization than overall book of business and that's purely due to management style of unmanaged plan. Providers will jack up utilization
*   **How do you do UM**
    *   A min of every six months, we re-do authorization
    *   What we look for: from a quality perspective, how does the request stack up against medical necessity criteria; how does the request stack up within the industry and standards that have been established in our field (Council of Autism Providers) - and then ongoing discussion with provider on what they're offering vs. what's mandated
        *   Say someone is asking for a 10 year old and that one goal is expressive language - so we'll pull guidelines from American Association of Pediatrics that would say expressive language beyond 9 years old is pretty rare. So we'd say what other modality are you working on?
        *   Or four year old is having tantrums and we want 0 tantrums and we'd say a four year old having tantrums is normal
        *   Or someone want comprehensive program for 15 year old - and we'd say no effective research shows comprehensive program beyond 12 years old
    *   Can be anywhere from 10 min conversation to 30 min conversation - ongoing collaborative discussion with provider is the objective - you want to prevent provider and member abrasion - if we were to come in too hot and just issue denials
*   We are not at the place where we can have a selective network. We just review on each prior auth as they come in the door and work with each provider to see what they want to work with. And then we can see which providers need more feedback vs. others to make sure managing utilization correctly
*   He personally prefers in-home providers - their costs are half the costs and in an industry bereft of clinical outcomes, that's something we have to consider
*   One of the seven tenets of ABA is generalization - parent is picking kid up from clinic and not stepping foot inside, so parent doesn't know what's going on. In-home services continues to be the gold standard, but it's based on states (some will have center-based programs - typically red states - b/c don't have an investment in school services and early intervention programs - so by the time they are identified, they are typically school aged and being sent to clinic)
*   He's been pretty vocal of PE involvement - they say need a rate increase b/c need to take it back to governing Board - but I don't care about their Boards
    *   Think they can "pull up" on what their OH is (not just rates)
    *   The thing with PE compared to independently owned clinician groups is they can be more nimble and creative - in areas with access issues, PE can move in (and Magellan has gone there with them)
    *   Thinks there should be more investment in quality side
    *   Gave a rate increase of 30% to all providers in the area and our MLR jumped by 10% but we didn't see a utilization change, just a rate change - they didn't put the hands into the physicians
*   **Quality** - looking for greater honest clinical conversation around what is autism. Oftentimes providers have no idea about co-occurring conditions
    *   Would like to see investment in having psychologists on staff, LCSW, etc. - so they can see co-occurring MH/BH conditions (e.g., depression) - wrap around
    *   With ABA being built on single subject design, we can't see what is quality on a macros level - we should see what is quality on an autism
    *   More investment in differential clinical models that we can apply to the individual based on clinical presentation - should we be doing parent training only, should we be doing group / social services - what kind of program should we be offering. Right now in ABA you see BCBA/RBT for everyone - which isn't sustainable from staffing perspective
    *   Would like alternatives to ABA - ABA should be gold standard for behavior symptomology of autism, not autism only - in fact the rest of the world ridicule the way America does autism care b/c you're only in this for ABA companies that are financially backed - should they be in this for 3-5 years as 40 hours? No. We should use at this as acute care - get in and get out and see what is true symptomology
        *   Cortica, Springtide, Kaiyo is doing a good job. Learn Behavioral - there's a growing trend of providers who are identifying that we should be doing something else that's out there
*   Think there's a place for telehealth, but some people can benefit from telehealth and others cannot (e.g., 3 year old cannot, but parent can for training programs)
*   Quality of care: look at how behaviors are trading, how violence scores are trending, behavior graphs,
*   Think rates will stay steady and increase with inflation - won't increase commensurate with what PE groups want. Don't see compression happening or any competitors saying oh we are looking at reducing rates - too much advocacy going on
*   At this point, no more providers earn enough market share to command premium rates - they get really big and then fail (CARD) - that has caused fragmentation of this group - so no one holds large enough market share (25-30%). He's not concerned about that
*   Have value-based arrangements with certain providers - model that they feel comfortable with and helping drive clinical innovation
    *   Down to do it with all of them - not at the point where can reinforce differentially based on other services. That's the future state
    *   Upside and downside, case rate per month
