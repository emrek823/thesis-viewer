## Slide 2: Health tech companies spend $1,000,000s scaling 100s of custom integrations, each with unique engineering and operational costs

Health tech companies spend $1,000,000s scaling 100s of custom integrations, each with unique engineering and operational costs

**Data sources shown in diagram (each with multiple instances):**
*   Claims
*   Specialty EHRs
*   Pharmacy
*   SDOH
*   ADT
*   Enrollment

**Target:**
*   HEALTH TECH COMPANY

**Bullet points:**
*   Each line represents 120+ engineering hours to build ($7700 labor)
*   Health tech growth companies spend $1m+ on building and maintaining integrations

## Slide 3: Arbizal unifies integrations into one standard format, via a simple AI-driven API, helping organizations scale their data infrastructure

Arbizal unifies integrations into one standard format, via a simple AI-driven API, helping organizations scale their data infrastructure

**Data sources shown in diagram (each with multiple instances):**
*   Claims
*   Specialty EHRs
*   Pharmacy
*   ADT
*   Enrollment
*   SDOH

**Flow:**
Data sources -> Arbizal API Solution (one single API) -> HEALTH TECH COMPANY

**Bullet points:**
*   <1 hour end to end
*   < 5% the cost of scaling with FTEs
*   Simple code and infrastructure maintenance

## Slide 4: An easy to use, reproducible workflow for every integration

An easy to use, reproducible workflow for every integration

**Watch Demo**

1.  Customer receives new data source
2.  Customer submits sample data from new data source to Arbizal API
3.  Arbizal's system automatically builds the bespoke data infrastructure for the new input
4.  Arbizal validates the data infrastructure and makes the data pipeline available to the customer
5.  Customer sends raw data to a single API to transform it into a standard output

## Slide 5: Arbizal's novel approach allows a shift from build to buy for healthcare data integrations

Arbizal's novel approach allows a shift from build to buy for healthcare data integrations

*   We use GenAI to completely automate. No copilots, new dashboards, or tools to keep track of. Just time-tested API standards
*   We support transforming any raw healthcare data to FHIR or an internal standard and we generate and maintain bespoke data pipelines – no pre-built connectors, no hub and spokes
*   We don't own or save your data and we require no protected information (PHI) for any of our builds
*   We're cost effective, a fraction of both building in-house, and buying from our competitors
*   Less than an hour, for a validated and production ready pipeline

## Slide 6: Technological advancements will lead to growth in the healthcare data integration market

Technological advancements will lead to growth in the healthcare data integration market

**Healthcare Data Integrations**
*   2023 value: $2.95b
*   CAGR 9.9%

**Bar Chart: Healthcare Data Integrations ($ Billion)**
| Year | Value ($ Billion) |
| :--- | :---------------- |
| 2023 | 2.95              |
| 2024 | ~3.3              |
| 2025 | ~3.6              |
| 2026 | ~3.9              |
| 2027 | ~4.4              |
| 2028 | ~4.9              |
| 2029 | ~5.3              |
| 2030 | ~5.8              |

**Opportunity**
*   Current solutions ignore startups and growth companies
*   Current solutions only operate on a limited set of data or require significant investment
*   Scaling integrations has to date been solved by increasing FTEs

**Market Changes**
*   More digital health and technology enabled companies means more integrations
*   New approaches to integration will allow more customers to enter the market
*   Increasing regulations require normalized data

**Arbizal's Positioning**
*   Built from the ground up with an innovative use of AI that make us agile and efficient
*   Pricing that scales with customers
*   Addressing the underserved custom integration market

**Signed Letter of Intent**

"Safety net health plans are a critical part of the ecosystem that care for our most complex populations. Messy and missing data are universal challenges for these plans and also play heavily into effective behavioral healthcare and health equity. I love where Arbizal is sitting in relation to this challenge. With their expertise we would have the opportunity to more quickly and effectively make sense of and augment these payers' data in order to contribute to that ecosystem." - Mark Liber, SVP Growth, Siftwell Analytics
