### Valjothi’s Background and Vision

- Second-time founder: Bachelor’s engineering, Master’s, MBA (India/US education)
- First company: Digital video recording space
	- Raised $20M, IP acquisition exit
	- Software powers 1 in 3 cable/satellite pause/rewind functions
- Personal motivation: Grandmother’s unexpected fall at 92
	- Hip surgery successful but never walked again
	- Died 6 years later bedridden despite best care
	- Led to 7-year deep dive into elder care industry

### Inficrest Platform and Business Model

- AI-powered fall prevention for seniors in long-term care facilities
- Technology approach:
	- Tracks 101 skeletal parameters via gait scan
	- Uses CDC-approved “get up and go” test
	- Combines sit-to-stand test with lifestyle/medication quiz
	- Generates 0-100 composite risk score (low/medium/high)
	- Real-time camera monitoring with computer vision
- Current traction:
	- Live at one facility doing 700 scans daily
	- Three contracts signed, early revenue stage
	- $49/month per camera pricing model
- Target market: Top 100 LTC facilities with 10,000+ members for trickle-down effect

### Funding and Milestones

- Raising $1.5M seed round
- Key goals with funding:
	- Reach 2,000 people scanned
	- Prove business model execution on existing contracts
	- Improve algorithms with high-quality data
	- Enable scale to large number of LTC facilities
- Market opportunity: 70% of older age problems are preventable
	- 1 in 4 elders fall annually
	- 2-3x higher fall rates in LTC facilities
	- 50% of elder hospitalizations from repeat falls

### Next Steps

- Emre to sync with partner Sean and respond early next week
- Potential second 60-minute call for deeper dive and go/no-go decision
- Virtue VC process: Two calls → full diligence over 1-2 weeks
- Follow-on capability: Limited due to fund size, but strong LP network for Series A
