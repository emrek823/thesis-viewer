## Slide 4: The current treatment paradigm for SMI is expensive & ineffective...

The current treatment paradigm for SMI
is expensive & ineffective...

The status quo for this patient population

**Treatment Flow:**
1.  Patient goes to ER / Inpatient Psych Unit due to their SMI
2.  Costly multi-day ER Stay + Lengthy Hospitalization

3.  Hospital discharges patient with a poor care plan
4.  Ineffective short-term outpatient treatment by non-profit providers

**Financial Impact:**
*   14M adults with SMI
*   $300B annual spend
*   $30K-1M Prior annual cost for patients Amae has treated

Amae's outcomes are 10x better than the standard of care...

**Outcome Comparison: Standard of Care vs. Amae Health**

| Metric                      | Standard of Care | VS | Amae Health |
| :-------------------------- | :--------------- | :- | :---------- |
| 30-day ER readmissions      | 23%              | VS | 3%          |
| Average LOS post readmission| 15 days          | VS | 1.5 days    |
| Medication adherence        | 53%              | VS | 90%         |
| Engagement drop out after 1-2 visits | 70%       | VS | 7%          |

These outcomes have led to **value-based care contracts**

Two sided go-to-market strategy that provides value to everyone

### Health Plans

**Customer Issue**
*   Amongst the most expensive members
*   Ineffective spend directed at acute emergency care only

**Methods of Contracting**
*   **Attributed Lives:** PMPM + Fee-for-service + Shared Savings
*   **Case Rate:** Monthly bundled payments
*   **Fee-For-Service:** Partial Hospitalization (PHP) + Intensive Outpatient (IOP) + Behavioral Health (OP) + Physical Health (OP)

### Health Systems

**Customer Issue**
*   Hospitals lose significant amounts of money on these patients
*   No safe discharge option – SMI is 2nd highest cause of readmission\*

**Methods of Contracting**
*   **Professional Services Agreement (PSA)** structure to serve as the outpatient SMI arm– at no cost to the health system
*   **Preferred Referral Relationships:** Benefits both national health systems and academic medical centers

\*CMS Hospital Star Rating – 22% of Star ratings are re-admissions. Higher Star ratings result in higher reimbursements from CMS.

## Slide 34: Testimonials

Testimonials

"I am grateful to Amae Health for the transformation I've witnessed over the past year. With Dr. Scott Fears' guidance, our son has found ways to live with and even to overcome many of the challenges he's been facing. He values the insights Dr. Fears brings to their conversations.

Our son has committed to the medication regimen and the recommendations he's received—from dietary adjustments to engaging in community activities, social interactions, and physical fitness.

The Amae caregiver meetings, especially the family support sessions led by Dr. Gary Tsai, have amplified our empathy for others in similar situations and has fostered hope.

We thank the clinic for their care and for making such a positive impact on our lives."

Testimonials

"I'm a sister of a member at Amae. I felt immediate relief from the beginning of our first visit to their facility. The staff is incredibly supportive, caring, and immediately follows up when needed. This is unfortunately rare in the mental health field.

Though it's only been less than two months since my brother has joined Amae, I've noticed significant improvement in his overall well-being. For the first time, my brother has accepted that he needs help and is willing and eager to continue to do the work at Amae. We're beyond grateful for the staff at Amae, and I'm excited for him to continue to stay on the right path."

| Resources Required     | * All clinical staff can be employed and paid for by Amae, with no costs incurred by CommonSpirit <br/> * Quality clinical reviews need to be conducted every quarter or half a year for Amae to work in collaboration with CommonSpirit on achieving common quality goals <br/> * Despite initial set-up pertaining to credentialing, this is resource effective long-term |
| Savings                | * By having a PSA model, Amae is able to take all insurances that CommonSpirit is in-network with <br/> * Amae focuses on CommonSpirit's population and can save $2-3k per ER visit, reduce length of stay in the inpatient psychiatry unit, and help reduce readmissions which impact STAR ratings                                            |
| Revenue Growth         | * Increase patient volume with reduction in length of stay for ED and Inpatient Psychiatry can lead to substantial revenue increase for CommonSpirit (see next slide for projections) <br/> * If CommonSpirit has any VBC contracts with quality incentives tied to HEDIS metrics such as readmissions, 7/30 day FUH, Amae can be supportive in helping to achieve the desired outcomes <br/> * The PSA Model allows CommonSpirit to capture revenue from patients treated by Amae via a revenue sharing arrangement (proposal is for 10% to CommonSpirit for administrative services) |
| Outcomes               | * Amae is able to become the exclusive outpatient SMI provider for CommonSpirit, and can focus on the most frequently re-admitting and costly patients                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Patient Retention & Loyalty | * Amae works to keep patients within CommonSpirit system for higher value procedures, and ensures CommonSpirit has higher patient retention as a result <br/> * Improved continuity of care and care coordination will improve patient outcomes and reduce their medical comorbidities                                                   |
| Research & Training    | * Amae will be conducting longitudinal research on the SMI population and joint Research between CommonSpirit and Amae becomes more easily integrated as the back and forth of data sharing is seamless <br/> * Amae can provide training and potential employment for CommonSpirit's Psychiatry, Internal Medicine and Primary Care residents                       |
