### Founder & Company Background

- Austin moved from Charleston to NY 3 years ago
- Previously worked at SnapCap (fintech), advertising company, and chemical manufacturing
- Started Arca after personal experience as medical tourist in Istanbul and Colombia
- Formally started working on Arca in fall 2023
- Brought on technical cofounder in January 2024
- Currently just two founders (Austin and CTO)

### Problem & Market Opportunity

- Medical tourism market has significant fragmentation
- Current process involves:
	- Google searches leading to blue links
	- WhatsApp communications with multiple clinics
	- Manual information submission
	- Cash payments ($5000 USD example given)
- Cost savings example: Dental implant
	- $3,300 in Williamsburg vs $350 in Colombia
- Core problem identified as trust layer in medical tourism

### Product Solution

- Lead capturing tool for clinics’ WhatsApp/social media/website
- Medical intake form with clinic snapshot (described as “medical version of Linktree”)
- Building agentic marketplace (in development)
- Scraping valuable data, photos, and accreditations
- Guided experience from discovery/research phase
- Planning coordinator/advisory guide role on platform

### Business Model & Traction

- Currently at $200-400K GMV
- Revenue model: 20% take rate on total procedure booked
	- Some markets (e.g., Colombia) require adjustment to 10% due to higher overhead
- Providing software free to clinics initially for distribution
- Building distribution through:
	- Paid media
	- On-ground coordinators
	- Community building with past patients

### Funding & Next Steps

- Seeking capital to:
	- Fund 9-12 months runway for founders
	- Enable in-person clinic partnerships
	- Test go-to-market strategies for CAC/LTV
- Focus on speed and quick iteration cycles
- Looking for initial capital before full seed round
