### JPM Healthcare Conference Preparation & Key BD Meetings

- UK Minister of Health meeting scheduled
	- Former Perspectum exec, interested in NHS data training
	- Pilot at Oxford proposed, follow-up meeting confirmed
	- Timeline: couple quarters to implement
- Tempest Therapeutics (highest priority BD meeting)
	- Meeting with Eric Lefoski, Ryan Fukushima (Pathos co-founder)
	- Pitch: SMB moves faster than Tempest’s internal foundation model development
		- Tempest behind on multimodal capabilities despite good resourcing
	- BMS angle: $10M data deal signed, foundation model not in SOW
		- Tempest redlined foundation model requirement from BMS contract
		- Opportunity for SMB to fill gap through Tempest or direct BMS relationship
- BMS Digital Health meeting
	- Reports to Greg Meyer (CTO)
	- Team positioning to control all AI including drug development
	- CMO recreated SMB figure from town hall (multimodal data → probability of technical success)
- Sanofi status: 98% confidence maintained
	- €360K pilot progressing well, Galen’s budget approved for larger deal
	- March timeline for expanded agreement
	- BD trying to inject themselves but limited influence
- AstraZeneca meeting scheduled
	- Close relationship with Tempest and likely Faisal Makmud/ABS partnership

### Investor Meetings & Fundraising Strategy

- Bessemer conversation positive
	- Asked about raise amount: “depends on valuation”
	- Target: 10-20% dilution, prefer lower end
- Sunflower meeting Friday (front-running JPM week)
	- Coming to San Francisco specifically for meeting
- Google Ventures confirmed, Kleiner Perkins rescheduled
- Standard Oil strategy articulation
	- Be standard representation of human patient data
	- Focus on infrastructure, avoid application layer where possible
	- Goal: plurality of data training → strong moat
	- Key challenge: being recognized as natural choice when suppliers realize need to build off SMB

### Technical Progress & Talent Acquisition

- Model performance validation
	- 1B to 8B parameter model: saturates on mortality prediction
	- Significant improvement on rare diseases/complex conditions (sarcomas)
	- Better toxic adverse event prediction at larger scale
- Priority hires identified:
- Academic collaborations advancing
	- UCSD writing paper using SMB model
	- MSK technical development continues
- Monthly burn: $136-170K, ~9 months runway

### Capital Deployment Strategy

- Aggressive real-world data acquisition
	- Gradient deal example: 1M images for $150K vs 10M for $1.5M (economies of scale)
	- Target companies willing to discount de-identified data
	- Focus on genomics, longitudinal EHRs (avoid pathology market)
- Data scaling thesis: plurality of training data = competitive advantage
	- Noetic comparison: 1K NSCLC patients vs SMB’s broader approach
	- Human data essential (can’t just use organoids/mouse models)
