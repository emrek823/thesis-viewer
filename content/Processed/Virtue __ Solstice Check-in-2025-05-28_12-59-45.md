### Pharma Pipeline Progress

- Stemline: Arranging in-person demo showcase
- Sanofi (furthest along in Big Pharma):
	- Connected with two teams:
		- Content Powerhouse (internal agency)
		- General Medicines team (manages 41 drugs)
	- Meeting with Content Powerhouse next week
	- Meeting Madeline at biopharma conference in June
	- Working toward pilot setup in coming weeks
- AstraZeneca/Alexion:
	- Company-wide initiative to reduce agency reliance
	- All large expenses now require global CFO review
- Additional pipeline: Axiom, Biogen, Phantom Pharmaceuticals

### Agency Relationships

- Publicis discussion ended after misaligned equity expectations:
	- They proposed 25% equity for $3M revenue promise
	- Counter-offered 0.3-0.4% with potential to reach 3-5% based on targets
- Agency revenue potential:
	- Standard agencies: $100-300K ARR
	- Large holding companies (e.g., Omnicom): $1-1.5M potential ARR
- Timeline for agency conversion:
	- 1-2 month pilot with 1-2 brands
	- Then conversion to enterprise contracts

### Product Strategy

- Current focus on content generation for three types:
	- Emails
	- Banner ads
	- Slides/deck content
- Fact-checking assistant viewed as:
	- Valuable for agency workflows
	- Will become a feature rather than standalone product for pharma
- Working to make content generation production-ready within next 6 weeks

### Team Updates

- Interns: Mixed performance, improving after expectations discussion
- BD hiring temporarily paused:
	- Seeking young, hungry candidates with agency sales experience
	- Looking for additional hiring contacts beyond Chewy

### Next Steps

- Target closing 1-2 pharma clients by early Q3
- Complete production-ready content generation within 1.5 months
- Continue agency onboarding but maintain primary focus on pharma outreach
- Resume BD hiring process in parallel with product development
