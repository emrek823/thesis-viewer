SOLSTICE HEALTH: REFERENCES & BACKCHANNEL

Table of Contents

#### Oncologist @ Maryland Oncology / Hematology (14 clinics, US Oncology Network)

Tell us about your practice and role

14 clinics

Oncologist, practicing for about 16 years. Part of a group Maryland Oncology / Hematology

Physician owned but contract with US Oncology

Tell us about how you met Solstice and view on product?

The guys had reached out to me as community physician to help streamline the medical record retrieval process and help to make it better for the physician (vs. just focusing on solving needs for the admin)

Medical records are biggest issue by far across our practice for all the technical initiatives we are exploring (RCM, scribing, etc)

My needs around record retrieval

None of us really think that EMRs make us more efficient. Most of the products have so many layers of complexity that we are actually less efficient. How do we solve that? The EMR is not solving it for us…

If you are working in 1 EMR - you don’t have a lot of visibility. They claims there is some cross talk but you can’t pull all the records that you really need

You don’t know your missing something until you see what you’re missing - it’s been eye opening to see the difference with Solstice vs. current process

Process today vs. what Solstice provides?

Right now, we have 2 full-time people in the medical records department. I have a medical records person that preps charts each day. She’ll reach out to pull these records - hopefully that’s prior to the appointment.

She’ll look at what I ordered ahead of time and try to go through and get all the records

More reactive than active today. Patients don’t always remember where they have records. I don’t realize that I’m looking at the records - not her fault

It’s not uncommon for a follow-up patient to say they were admitted last week and we are abruptly looking for the records day of and are unable to pull.

We have to send the patient home and have them come back for another visit - it really messes with the efficiency we want to establish as a community practice

How does the medical record retrieval office view?

Solstice came down and worked directly with my admin that works with medical records.

She did a parallel trial for Solstice and did her regular way of pulling data. She was able to pull everything that she wanted to pull using Solstice

She was very impressed after the initial trial. Everyone who does these record pulls think they have great coverage until they actually see all the data. That was the turning point for me and for our team.

I love working with my staff but they are not going through and summarizing/filtering everything for me in a way that is efficient. There’s a lot of work I still have to do in my unfortunately short visit time.

What is the interaction / decision-making process from US Oncology?

EMR / PM - we’re paying US oncology for business mgmt services. Part of that fee does cover IT costs. We used McKesssons’ EMR called iKnowMed.

Transitioned to new PM system as well

We have a portal specific for US oncology

To do extra things, we have the ability to adapt it to what we need of course.

Can you dive deeper on product experience? What did you work with them on as design partner?

What exact data types we need.

When we have a patient come in, we need a lot of records. Pathology, imaging, labs, notes. Huge amount of data. We discussed how everything should look and the exact data types I’d need for which patients and for follow-up vs. new visits

The actual interface

How much do I want as a physician vs. having the medical records staff do more of the summarization and bringing relevant things to the top

That’s a big value-add. It’s much, much easier to codify it in Solstice than working with variability of my staff

What do current referral networks look like today?

We’re through the entire state of MD - you are pulling through all of MD and into Washington DC. Multiple big health networks - MedStar, Hopkins, University of MD.

We have 50 odd physicians throughout the organization and we’re also pulling records from all community providers. It’s a pain for the large health systems at times, let alone going to all these community providers.

I specialize in urological cancers for example so I’m working with a lot of urology groups

There’s large urology groups, independent PCPs that I typically engage with, health systems, radiation oncology that we need to coordinate with

ROI / Decision-making Process

We’re really making our decision off efficiency and completeness of the record pull

Completeness of the records - they’ve already shown in a retrospective study that they are pulling 2x the records that staff was. That’s why my admin was so impressed.

Efficiency - they are able to pull patients same day if you need in minutes. The efficiency is night and day.

For medical record retrieval, it’s such a core part of our operations, that efficiency and completeness alone would cause us to adopt. We all realize the problem and know how this can make us more efficient, see more patients, and drive more revenue to the practice. This isn’t a new fancy widget - just a much better way to do what we are already doing.

Ultimately, the pilot that they did with us is what I’d take to the committee and then they could expand throughout the other practices in our group and throughout US Oncology. We all talk as I mentioned.

Future product developments you’d like to see?

One of the things we discussed recently - Can you adapt it with other groups?

They’ve shown this in some other practices I know and they are able to customize based on oncologist preferences very easily. The core product is the same but it’s great to be able to customize for what I want for the initial implementation

#### Oncologist @ Alabama Oncology (26 physicians, 6 offices)

What’s your role / background?

Primarily cancer surgery but practiced in every setting you could imagine from large hospitals in the northeast, to UAB down here, to community practice currently.

Community practices just have a different pace and way of seeing patients - we are running an optimized business. These academic guys see 1-2 patients per day. Like the pace in a community setting.

How’d you meet the guys? Interaction?

Emailed back and forth - asked if I wanted to do pilot study and it made so much sense initially to work with this type of solution.

Pilot study and ran through to see what they could find about individual patients. It was accurate and very timely.

It really only took me 2 patients to get hooked.

I had one patients admitted to the hospital that I had enrolled the week before and this guy was in the ICU and it was freaking me out a little bit. They were able to pull that for me immediately and the records were very accurate.

I had another homeless patient who was a meth addict and I knew literally nothing about this patient. Solstice was able to even pull that for me. That’s all I needed to see.

Thoughts on the guys?

“I’m personally investing $100K - no brainer.”

They are rolling this out in oncology first which makes sense, but the applications here are way beyond that. Nursing homes, PCPs - it’s hard for me to think of a doctor in our network that we interact with that wouldn’t want this

Life before Solstice

1 full-time person today just for me - we cross-train her to different admin work but she’s stuck chasing down these records all day long.

Start from scratch all the time - do the scans, do the bloodwork. Re-run everything - huge waste of resources and these are smaller things that we don’t make a ton of money on - I want to be doing surgeries.

Most of my patients are coming from another referral or different source. Such an effort to enter it to the EMR. Such an effort to integrate it into the EMR - we end up having to call them.

They send ¾ of it and its faxed. You get it off the fax machine, then they scan it. You call it gets faxed and when you scan it you enter it to the OncoEMR and make a notation what it is.

Literally 5 steps involved that are entirely too cumbersome and unnecessary.

What would you want to see to get this implemented across practice?

Our administrative guys ultimately make the call but it's based on oncologist experience.

Really being judged on efficiency + completeness.

We need more records and time savings. We see extreme time savings from Solstice it’s not a small delta - we’re talking hours/days vs. minutes with Solstice. I have no idea what their secret sauce is under the hood but it’s incredible.

They can do a retrospective study like they did in Maryland to show the increased completeness of records based on what we’ve done historically and it’s pretty obvious when you do one case how efficient it can be and how much time it can save.

What do you want to see going forward from a product perspective?

Your fantasy is to find that stuff and drop and drag into EMR and auto-populates it. The guys wanted to look at clinic record and office record

#### Technical Co-founder @ Redox

How has space evolved?

We were too early but that’s a story for another time…I wish I was starting a new company in interop now with all the tools people have at their disposal.

When we started out, it was an entirely different world - we were focused on making it easier to connect the innovators to health systems. Today, we’re trying to pivot more towards the enterprise and take advantage of our push/pull capabilities that we have with health systems.

Future is going beyond this breadth we see with the HIEs. Particle and Health Gorilla are fighting back and forth claiming that one has 92% coverage vs. 90% coverage. At the end of the day, it doesn’t make a huge difference. It’s all about usability.

Have to remember though that you are still getting these JSON files from these guys (HG/Particle) - easier than dealing with C-CDAs but nothing a provider can actually use

Medical record retrieval specific to oncology - any thoughts/experience?

Oncology data has been poorly supported from a standards perspective and there’s a lot of oncology data that you need that isn’t in the HIEs

Cancer staging, tumor size, different reference labs/biomarker reports - you’re missing that data if you are only working with HIEs

You need something like a Ciox or a Moxe to really get everything you need but they really aren’t working with community practices

Check out mCODE for example - another standard people are trying to create. I don’t think another standard created by a group like ASCO is the solution here (we have enough standards). It’s more of a representation to me of the need and complexity in oncology

Any thoughts on Switchboard or general Ciox/Datavant commentary?

They are trying to pivot out of the manual business and Switchboard is their attempt to automate some of the manual processes and put an API in front of it.

It’s a mechanical turk operation though - 50% of it is still extremely manual.

Decent traction with Switchboard - we were trying to partner with them at Redox. They started in 2021 - 1000 health systems at this point

Impact of LLMs

2 main areas I’m actively exploring right now with Redox or companies i advise

Medical summarization - the idea of saying give me a medical record and summarize this content for me. Prompt it and say what would oncologist be interested in. Surface lab results. This is technically easier to do now but the devil is in the details about understanding exactly what people want to see and being able to automate some process to create different views/options for different providers. It’s great to be able to customize this now vs. hiring all the nurses that Flatiron had to do back in the day and still have on staff. Their NLP engineers over there are struggling because they are still working on homegrown ETL tool - dying for even a FiveTran

More generative AI: Down the line, you can do some really interesting / impactful things with all the data you collect. If you have access to all these records, LLMs would be great to train on these records and better be able to create a “synthetic record”. This is where space is going but you need access to the data in the first place

#### VP Corp Dev @ Moxe

Moxe vs. Ciox?

Moxe has the opportunity to be a real platform - it took us a while, but that’s why I joined over the last 3 years. We put in the necessary development time to build a product vs simply chasing $ that was out there

We help providers share clinical data with people they don’t trust, which is mostly payers. We drive bi-directional insights

Honestly, we’re seeing Ciox less and less in the health systems we are targeting. I don’t know if it’s the exact customers we are targeting or if they are pulling away after merger.

Current state of interop / record retrieval?

Charts are moving around on paper today and cost $40 typically

Redox is great for some use cases but it’s really just an abstracted EMR in the cloud that’s optimized for meds and allergies - really surface level stuff.

We are a full payload for everything you may need, which is a requirement going forward.

Going forward, deep, longitudinal clinical data is the lifeblood for any business and any provider. The value of this data is immense, not just for life sciences, but providers are starting to realize they are sitting on a gold mine of data and want to play a part in getting value from the data. Both in the near-term to drive operations and more revenue, and in the long-term to be part of these broader networks

Thoughts on Particle / HG specifically?

I don’t know who wins in that space but I’m more curious what people build on top of these platforms. HIEs are great starting points but as this access becomes commoditized, what’s next?

Moxe approach to win in this world?

We’ve really started to evolve towards working more with payers

Working with the blues and HCA is a big one. If you can get clinical and claims data and route to the provider, you can do a lot of innovative stuff

If you have access to real-time clinical data, you re-think prior auth and payment integrity

Moxe would love to enable

Encounter is closed

Route to neutral cloud

Paid in less than a minute

More forward thinking but focused on FFS today as we talk to more groups taking risk

#### Running Commentary from Datavant Summit (10.2 - 10.3)

“We win on 1) being Switzerland and working with all players (life sciences, payers, providers; multiple cloud partners, etc) and 2) ubiquity. Our partners are asking for data beyond commoditized claims datasets today and we’re looking for deeper, more specific datasets to fill out their increasingly complex requests” - Datavant CCO
