## Slide 2: Under Pressure, Providers Look to Boost Revenue and Retain Patients with Leaner Teams

Under Pressure, Providers Look to Boost Revenue and
Retain Patients with Leaner Teams

**Staffing Shortages**
Providers are impacted by
staffing shortages and high
headcount costs
($40K-$50K per admin staff)

**Administrative Burden**
Staff spend ~15% of their time
on admin tasks that AI could
automate, limiting time available
for billable patient care

**Revenue Leakage**
Healthcare organizations lose
10-30% of potential revenue
from patients underutilizing
services covered by their
insurance

## Slide 3: Voice AI agents will transform clinics by bridging the gap between patient communication and care delivery

Voice AI agents will transform clinics by bridging the
gap between patient communication and care delivery

**Current patient engagement fall short**
* Call centers are **expensive, hard to scale, with limited hours**
* Text and email solutions offer **low engagement** and easily ignored
* Only **simple tasks** are handled such as scheduling or simple Q&A
* Often require **repetitive communication** from the care team

**Voice AI opens up a host of opportunities**
* Scalable, cost-effective, 24/7 availability
* Consistent empathetic conversations
* Handles **high touch, complex health dialogues with proactive outreach**
* Inclusive, multi-language support
* Seamless integration into care team workflow reducing re-work and making care delivery more efficient

Voice AI isn't just about replacing call centers – it's **about transforming patient engagement into high-value, para-clinical care** that drives better health outcomes.

## Slide 4: Not a call center: Kelli is an AI teammate for long, complex, high-value patient calls

Not a call center: Kelli is an AI teammate for
long, complex, high-value patient calls

**Clinical grade Voice AI for paraclinical tasks**
24/7 multilingual support
Ability to communicate with patients and deliver essential health screenings
Scaleable over high call volumes and large patient panels

* + Pre-visit health questions
* + Health assessments and screenings

**Drive top line growth:** follow up with every lead to enroll and retain healthier patients

**Expand revenue streams:** set up new care services with reduced staffing needs

**Improve bottomline:** automate manual outreach workflows and improve staffing ratio/patient flow

## Slide 9: Kelli demo : Pre-visit outreach and care gap closure

Kelli demo : Pre-visit outreach
and care gap closure

[Video frame showing a chat interface]
Kelli: Hi, this is Kelli calling from NorCal
Health Center. May I speak to Robert?
Patient: Yeah, this is Robert.

Kelli uses voice-native AI,
with custom safety tuning to stay on track.

**Demo highlights:**
1. AI agent automatically **asks for consent and verifies patient ID**
2. AI agent is able to **carry out custom workflow** depending on patient care gap and needs
3. AI agent **shows empathy and repeats information back** to the patient at the end of call

Smooth transition into PHQ-9 depression screening
Kelli: Thank you, Robert. That matches the information I
have. Okay, moving on. The next questions are about how
you have been feeling lately. These questions help us better
understand your emotional well-being. Please answer as you
feel comfortable. First question: Over the past two weeks,
how often have you been bothered by having little interest or
pleasure in doing things?
Patient: I rarely find pleasure in doing things these days
because you know I lost my housing about a month ago and
it's just really been tough to find a place to stay night by
night.

Kelli uses voice-native AI,
with custom safety tuning to stay on track.

**Demo highlights:**
1. AI agent is able to **give questions and respond to answers with empathy** while maintaining assessment flow
2. AI agent is able to **interpret patient answers and confirm**
3. AI agent **asks the patient to clarify** as needed

## Slide 11: Kelli is built using model-agnostic tools with a robust application and evaluation layer

Kelli is built using model-agnostic
tools with a robust application
and evaluation layer

**Stack Layers:**
*   **App layer**
    *   Care team facing dashboards and text based tools
    *   Model-agnostic tools for on/post call task completion
*   **Safety and eval**
    *   Proprietary training data (Audio + annotated workflow scripts)
    *   Automated prompt and call flow builder (automates workflow build and evaluation)
    *   Safety engine (Customized model filters all patient-facing comms)
*   **Infra layer**
    *   Best in market STT/TTS models
    *   Foundation models (e.g. Gemini 2.5 Pro & Flash)
    *   Telephony (Twilio)
*   **Reinforcement learning pipeline** (connects Safety and eval to Infra layer models)

Kelli has built a differentiated tech
stack that allows us to **plug and play**
**the best models** through our **robust**
**application layer.**

**Highlights:**
*   **Separates AI instructions and patient data:** main agent talks to the patient, without EHR access. Smarter, slower background agents handle PHI with least-privilege access.
*   **Reinforcement learning pipeline** with custom evaluation tools to expand scarce customer data.
*   **Dedicated safety engine** that sets call flow guardrails and monitors all calls to ensure patient safety and compliance.

## Slide 16: Competitive differentiation

Competitive differentiation

**Healthcare Voice AI: Revenue Impact vs. Workflow Specialization**

[Chart with two axes: Revenue impact (Y-axis) and Workflow specialization (X-axis)]

*   **kelli care** (ECW/AWV focus) - High Revenue Impact, Medium Workflow Specialization
*   **Assort Health** (Specialist admin) - Medium Revenue Impact, Medium Workflow Specialization
*   **Hippocratic AI** (Clinical models) - Medium-Low Revenue Impact, High Workflow Specialization
*   **Parakeet Health / hellopatient** (General patient engagement) - Low Revenue Impact, Low Workflow Specialization

*   **Our differentiation:** Uniquely built for **revenue-generating workflows** via our custom tech stack optimized for **accurate, more complex, longer calls.**
*   **How we win:** Deliver **$500K of value annually per clinic** while competitors focus on admin tasks (Assort), general engagement (Parakeet/Hello), or clinical Q&A (Hippocratic).
