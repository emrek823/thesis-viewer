### Product & Market Overview

- Small to mid-sized health systems typically have 5-10 CDI staff (from original notes)
- Hospital medicine focus due to:
	- Acts as gatekeeper for hospital admissions
	- Currently has low to no CDI coverage
	- Documentation starts there on admissions
	- Key areas: Hospital medicine, ED, ICU, surgical departments

### Technical Approach

- Data integration strategy:
	- Large initial data dump from hospital warehouse if available
	- Ongoing API calls synced to shift changes
	- More cautious with ED integration due to higher frequency refresh needs
- Focused on high-value targets:
	- Identified 19 key CCs and MCCs that generated $22M in one year (UCLA study)
	- Out of 70,000 total ICD-10 codes
	- Prioritizing by volume and DRG weight impact

### Go-to-Market Strategy

- Two-pronged approach:
	- Building physician champions who love the product
	- Selling ROI to C-suite
- Land and expand strategy:
	- Starting with smaller hospitals
	- Moving into larger systems
- Strategic advisors:
	- Four revenue cycle management platform executives
	- Providing introductions to key customers

### Revenue Model

- Focus on DRG uplift through:
	- Improved documentation leading to MCC capture
	- Increased case mix index
- Targeting hospitals currently in the red
- Revenue-focused approach rather than cost replacement

### Next Steps

- Team to send demo to Emre
- Emre to respond early next week (before July 4th)
- Potential 60-minute follow-up call if both sides interested
