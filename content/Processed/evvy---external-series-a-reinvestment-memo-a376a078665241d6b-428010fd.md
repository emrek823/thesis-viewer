# Evvy - External Series A Reinvestment Memo

## Executive Summary

Evvy is building a personalized medicine platform to close the gender health gap by discovering and leveraging overlooked female biomarkers, starting with the vaginal microbiome. The company is creating a consumer-facing brand that women love, developing sophisticated proprietary bioinformatics for the vaginal microbiome, and validating clinical pathways to close the loop on care. This approach has the potential to transform care for women in an area that has been woefully underserved to-date. With this potential comes complexity in tying together multiple parts of the organization - from product to science to clinical - to maintain scientific and clinical validity while reaching the scale necessary to make a transformative impact.

Raising an additional $1.5M - $2M today gives Evvy 18-24 months of runway to ensure the company hits key milestones to raise a strong Series A, whether in early 2023 or beyond. These key milestones include launching a care delivery arm to improve member retention and gross margins, reaching a >$2-4M run rate, securing B2B partnerships with life science strategics, and continuing to validate its internal data and insights engine. This investment gives Virtue the potential to secure our Series A investment in a portfolio company that has earned our re-investment dollars over the last 12 months.

Virtue is investing $925K in $1.5M - $2M round at a $45M cap and 10% discount. This investment would bring our total ownership to a minimum of 3% after conversion of the convertible note.

## Women's Health Market

**Underinvestment in Women's Health:** Women are >50% of the population, spend ~$500B on healthcare annually, and make 80% of healthcare decisions. Despite these realities, only 5-10% of annual digital health funding went into the space over the last 5 years. The number of companies funded and dollars flowing into the space has continued to grow, but we are still in the early innings of growth. A majority of this funding has gone to companies supporting reproductive health, but women are more than their reproductive organs. Companies focused only on building around this need miss the greater opportunity to enhance the holistic health experience for women.

**Go-to Women's Health Brand:** When women access care with a typical PCP, OB-GYN or other provider in the current medical system, their unique concerns and biology are often ignored. On average, women are diagnosed on average 4 years later than men across over 700 diseases. Studies have shown that women often have their pain and symptoms dismissed by doctors because “women complain more than men” or “women are better able to tolerate pain”. On the other side of the spectrum, consumer or lifestyle brands (e.g., Goop) can reach a wide audience but don't have the clinical underpinnings or tone to make a real impact on women and their health journeys. Women - from puberty to menopause - lack a go-to brand where they feel heard, understood, and are able to easily access high quality care.

**Post-Roe World:** These tailwinds and trends in women's health are only becoming more vital in a post-Roe world. Access to abortion, which is a vital component for the health, safety, and well-being for all women, is being attacked. Many are concerned that this assault on women's rights may a harbinger of additional regulation and restrictions in the women's health space. In the near-term, reductions in access to abortions will have very real impacts on women around the country and the physicians and companies providing those services. States, the federal government, and corporations around the country are already responding swiftly to protect access to reproductive rights. We anticipate an increasing wave of interest and attention focused on the women's health space as companies and patients fight back against this assault. The Roe decision has only further inspired a fervent community in women's health. Now is the time to build a women's health brand that leverages lessons from early torch bearers in the digital health space, best-in-class technology, a sophisticated organic marketing approach, and increased attention to help women who need it most.

## Early Evidence of Building Marquee Brand

Since launching in July 2021, Evvy has hit an annual revenue run-rate of >$1M (May-22). Evvy's approach and initial product - an at-home vaginal microbiome test - has created a highly trusted brand that consumers love and support.

**Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) breakdown:** Intense customer loyalty has driven strong organic customer growth with >70% organic acquisition to-date. Evvy has built a vibrant community on social media, with 50K followers and >1M likes on TikTok. To-date, Evvy has a blended CAC of $25 (e.g. organic and paid advertising), which is top decile compared to other companies in market today. Evvy will continue to leverage these strong organic growth channels and optimize its paid marketing channels to drive the growth of the brand, the number of women on the platform, and the size of the overall dataset. The company will always rely on a strong organic marketing strategy given the brand they have cultivated, but this low CAC gives them the flexibility to invest more heavily as they scale.

**High Customer NPS:** A typical healthcare brand will have an NPS of 30-40 depending on the business type or patient focus, but Evvy has demonstrated an impressive NPS of 80 to-date. This improvement on the status quo is reflective of the acute need and strong demand from customers, but also a result of Evvy's nuanced approach and messaging. Customers rave about Evvy's commitment to de-stigmatizing women's health, putting them back in control of their bodies, and allowing them to be heard unlike other healthcare experiences. Trust and affiliation with the brand is a key foundation for growth for any D2C company, but is even more relevant given Evvy's long-term plans for growth. A superior consumer experience and long-term engagement with the brand gives Evvy the privilege to grow its dataset and deliver higher quality insights to patients.

### Evvy Customer Reviews

**"Fast turnaround!"**
I love how fast I got my results back with detailed explanation about my findings. I also appreciate the fact that I am able to schedule an appointment with someone of Evvy's team for a consultation about my results :)
– ELSIE K.

**Empowering & unprecedented**
I feel like Evvy gave me more insights than my doctors ever did. The results experience was super empowering and I feel like I finally understand this versus feeling in the dark as I did before.
– PADMA S.

**After recurrent UTIs, relief**
After two years of constant UTIs, the only thing my doctors would offer me was antibiotics and the painstaking reminder to pee after sex.
I was taking all the preventative measures possible and had little to no insight on what was going on down there – despite how many doctor's appointments
I went to. I finally feel like I have other options I can explore and just a better sense of my own vaginal health. Above all, I am just a fanatic fan of Evvy's commitment to elevating women's health and beyond thankful to see female-founded health startups.
– ABIGAIL N.

**Cheaper than insurance**
The Evvy testing is much more detailed than the one the doctor gives you. For me Evvy was actually cheaper than what my insurance paid as well.
Talking with experts on the vaginal biome was extremely helpful in understanding the results and the recommendations that were given to improve my symptoms.
– KIM C.

**Care Delivery:** Evvy is already showing signs of its ability to build a longitudinal relationship with patients, and care delivery is the next step on that journey. Today, >40% of patients opt-in for an annual subscription (4 tests / year) vs. a one-time test kit. The annual subscription allows women to track changes in their vaginal microbiome over time, derive more specific insights, and ultimately deepens their relationship with the brand. Over the last 12 months, customers have been imploring Evvy to provide a care delivery option because of their strong relationship with brand and lack of other options. Given the strong organic growth, high NPS, and desire to build a more entrenched relationship that its customer are asking for, Evvy is planning to launch a care delivery arm in October 2022 utilizing Wheel for clinicians on the back-end. Care delivery will improve LTV, long-term retention, and gross margins. While care delivery is not the ultimate vision for Evvy, it will help create the largest engaged community of women and associated microbiome data. Because Evvy owns the longitudinal patient relationship and has patient consent, they are able to improve the care experience and increase the breadth and depth of its data assets.

## Building a Personalized Medicine Platform for Women's Health

Evvy has created a consumer-facing brand that women love. This brand gives the company a unique opportunity to leverage this patient base to develop proprietary bioinformatics workflows for the vaginal microbiome (and beyond) and validate clinical pathways to close the loop on care.

Evvy is leveraging the current evidence base for metagenomic sequencing of the vaginal microbiome in bacterial vaginosis (BV) and the high prevalence and recurrence of BV today as a wedge into a broader opportunity. From there, the company can expand to:
* Other health issues related to vaginal microbiome (STI, yeast infections, pre-term birth, cervical cancer, etc)
* New sample types (saliva, blood, urine, etc) and 'omics technologies (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, etc).

**Vaginal Microbiome - BV:** The vaginal microbiome is a community of microbes that live in the vagina, acting as a local immune system. In an optimal state, the vaginal microbiome is dominated by protective bacteria that produce lactic acid keeping the vaginal pH low and making it difficult for pathogens to thrive. When this normal or healthy state is perturbed, it can lead to a number of female health issue, including BV, STIs, Yeast Infections, Pre-term birth, Cervical Cancer, and PCOS.

30% of women have BV and up to 80% of women will recur within 9 months following treatment. Previous academic literature supports the metagenomic and phenotypic analysis of the vaginal flora based on the extensive and growing list of microbes and potential pathogens associated with BV, and the low sensitivity and specificity rates of current diagnostic tools. The largest microbiome dataset prior to Evvy was 400 patients in an academic clinical trial. Today, Evvy has analyzed >5K patients, retained exclusive rights to the biobanked samples, and developed a proprietary bioinformatics platform for analysis of microbiome data. This scale and access to high-quality metagenomic data gives the company the ability to use its proprietary reference dataset as the de-facto standard for the industry. The company can move from identifying species and strains (e.g., better understand diversity) to discovering SNPs (e.g., correlating specific mutations with BV recurrence) of interest, to understanding function (e.g., understanding metabolites produced from biofilm forming genes). Evvy couples this bioinformatic data with other “whole person" characteristics, symptoms, behaviors, and demographics. The company's relationship and trust with the patient gives them the ability to collect rich, longitudinal health data.

### Evvy BV Patient Report

**MAY 17, 2021**
**Hannah, meet your microbiome.**

**Microbiome Composition:**
*   Lactobacillus crispatus: 41.12%
*   Prevotella bivia: 10.34%
*   Corynebacterium: 9.11%
*   DISRUPTIVE Gardnerella vaginalis: 8.73%

**WHAT TO KNOW**
*   Research has shown that Gardnerella vaginalis may be associated with bacterial vaginosis. G. vaginalis can catalyze an inflammatory immune response and damage vaginal cells.
*   It can also develop biofilm (a sticky, strong layer of infection cells) leading to difficult-to-treat bacterial vaginosis. The biofilm created by G. vaginalis may help other disruptive bacteria grow such as Atopobium.
*   Symptoms of the presence of this bacteria include abnormal discharge such as grey color or watery texture.

**Vaginal Microbiome - Other:** Beyond BV, there are a number of other female health issues where vaginal microbiome data is extremely valuable in guiding care that is underutilized today. Research has suggested that the composition of the vaginal microbiome has a significant impact on the risk of pre-term birth. Women with PCOS (~10% of the female population) have a distinct vaginal microbiome composition compared to healthy controls that can be used to better understand symptoms. Increasing evidence shows that changes in the vaginal microbiome an active role in the development and/or progression of HPV infection, as a result, cervical cancer.

**Female Health Issues related to Vaginal Microbiome:**
*   Bacterial Vaginosis
*   Pre-term Birth
*   Recurrent UTIs
*   Pelvic Inflammatory Disease
*   IVF Success / Fertility
*   Cervical Cancer
*   Endometriosis & PCOS
*   Yeast Infections
*   STI Acquisition

**Expanding beyond vaginal microbiome:** Evvy has built the core bioinformatics platforms, internal capabilities, and sophistication in the biomarker space to set the foundation for expansion into other areas beyond the microbiome. Evvy can also leverage its bioinformatics expertise and repeatable playbook with other sample types (saliva, blood, urine, etc) and 'omics technologies (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, etc) to develop a suite of female health biomarkers for diseases that go beyond the vaginal microbiome. Women weren't allowed to participate (or required to be represented) in clinical research until June 10th, 1993 when congress passed the NIH Revitalization Act. This sobering fact is a reminder that much of current medical practice, which is codified and disseminated over decades, does not take into account women's unique biology. Women's bodies are just fundamentally more complex than men's, and these differences have systemic influences beyond vaginal health.

Women experience adverse drug reactions (ADRs) nearly twice as often as men, yet the role of sex as a biological factor in the generation of ADRs is poorly understood. Estrogen has protective effect on cardiovascular functioning but therapeutic mechanisms to leverage its effects (e.g., increasing angiogenesis and vasodilation, and decreasing ROS, oxidative stress, and fibrosis) have not been explored. Studies have shown that perimenopause, a time of considerable variability in ovarian hormone secretion, is associated with an increased vulnerability to depression. Worldwide, women with dementia outnumber men 2 to 1. Although women do live longer than men, brain scans tell us that the rate at which brain cells are dying in the brain is faster in women than in men. In 2021 a large study of nearly 400,000 women, found both new and old HRT drugs reduced the risk of diseases that cause dementia. Women are not only fighting against biases and perceptions that impact their health as mentioned above, but a fundamental misunderstanding of their biology.

**Closing the loop:** Evvy is going beyond surfacing data and truly “closing-the-loop" on care and providing personalized, actionable insights for patients. The company is beginning to roll out a care delivery arm, which will increase overall patient volume, long-term patient retention, and the overall breadth and depth of data collection. Evvy has laid the technical foundation, built the trusted brand and relationship, and hired the team to generate insights across all of women's health - no matter the sample type, organ, or technology.

## Go-to-market (GTM) Evolution:

**Direct Access Testing and Diagnostics-as-a-service (DaaS) Trends:** Even though lab tests and diagnostics inform 70%-80% of medical decisions, the space has been drastically underfunded to-date compared to other areas of digital health. The diagnostics and lab industry is falling further behind in the trends of digitalization and consumerization in an area that has long been dominated by a de-facto duopoly (e.g., LabCorp, Quest). Many vulnerable patients struggle to access high-quality diagnostic labs, the patient experience in labs is often abysmal even compared to other subpar experiences in healthcare, and patients have little or no transparency into the process after leaving a lab or clinic.

Over the last 2 years, Covid has improved consumers' awareness of and access to direct access testing (DAT), where patients can purchase tests directly and bypass physicians' orders. Consumers will continue to demand the same level of access, convenience, and transparency with their lab testing needs. With these tailwinds pushing decentralization and consumerization, emerging business models around “diagnostics-as-a-service” (DaaS) have shown early signs of success. DaaS vendors, such as iXlayer and Rupa Health, provide seamless tech integrations, intuitive UI/UX, and derive insights from data to build impactful companies that provide value above and beyond assays, reagents, and bench-top instruments.

**Leveraging D2C testing to expand into other business models:** Trends around DAT, DaaS, and Evvy's own success on the D2C give Evvy the foundation to accomplish its ultimate vision to become a data and insights engine for women's health.

The D2C focus today is vital for the future Evvy wants to create. To create a transformative women's health brand, you have to build a community that's truly differentiated from women's current healthcare experiences. The D2C strategy has given Evvy the privilege to learn about its customers in an intimate and real way that is more empowering experience than what women are accustomed to. The company is seeing the early returns of the compounding effects these communities can have.

**Enterprise Relationships:** A strong user base and technology infrastructure give Evvy the opportunity to explore different enterprise partnerships and GTM strategies as its data and insights capabilities evolve. Research partnerships with academic institutions (e.g., Columbia and UVA) help to expand the utility of its internal research engine by exploring its bio-banked human specimens. Because of this robust scientific and clinical validation, Evvy has inbound interest from pharma (Ferring, GSK), diagnostic (LabCorp), and health system partners (Mayo Clinic) for a variety of use cases. Examples include biomarker discovery, translational research on bio-banked samples, and co-development of a clinical platform through existing clinician networks. Large incumbents in the women's health space are recognizing the importance of a winning customer experience, but struggle to develop their internal capabilities. These initial partnership give Evvy access to novel distribution channels, revenue streams, and additional research/thought partners. Evvy has earned the right to explore these strategic partnerships so early in its growth and will spend the next 6-12 months cementing a more scalable strategy.

## Comps in Personalized Medicine Space:

After only 12 months, Evvy has gone above and beyond other bioinformatics and testing players (e.g., Jungla) because of its advanced bioinformatics capabilities and unique data access given its relationship with patients. This rapid progress gives the company the optionality to build many possible futures. Ciitizen, a mobile personal health record focused in rare disease, autoimmune, and oncology, was acquired by Invitae in 2021 for $325M. Ciitizen raised $20M, had built a scalable patient application, a robust technology infrastructure, but, unlike Evvy has already shown, failed to grow its overall patient base and drive significant engagement amongst users.

Many of the largest and most successful companies in the personalized medicine space to-date (e.g., Flatiron, Tempus) have been in oncology space because of the overall market size and R&D spend. Comparatively, the R&D spend to-date in women's health is lower today because of many factors. Chief among them are the fact that innovation in women's health is hindered because conditions are not fatal (as opposed to oncology, for example) and the inability and unwillingness for pharma companies to expand beyond contraception to address the majority of the untapped $61B women's health market (slide 37). The autoimmune space, a similarly "non-fatal” area which includes Humira (the greatest selling drug of all time launched in 2003 by Abbott), went through a similar evolution. Over the last 10 years, venture funding for autoimmune has increased almost 10x ($201M in 2012, $1.9B in 2021) as the classic “fast-follower” mentality in the pharmaceutical industry inspired others to enter the space. Today, Bayer, Organon (Merck), Myovant, and others are pushing the women's health space forward in a similar manner.

**Financing plans:** Evvy is raising $1M - $2M to ensure additional runway during uncertain market conditions and provide the flexibility to ensure the company hits key milestones prior to a Series A. After raising its $5M seed, Evvy has burned <$1M over the last 12 months. The company is extremely cash efficient given management's strategy and commitment to sustainable growth, its organic marketing strategy, and the overall demand from market and pull from customers. As expected at this early-stage, >60% of burn is on people. The team is planning to bring on another 2-3 individuals prior to the Series A based on progress over the next 6-9 months.

**Milestones:** Key milestones prior to the Series A raise include:
1.  Launching a care delivery arm to improve member retention and gross margins;
2.  Reaching a >$2-4M run rate;
3.  Securing B2B partnerships with life science strategics; and
4.  Continuing to validate its internal data and insights engine

With conservative, base, and aggressive burn scenarios the company has enough runway for at least another 18 months. The company has plans to raise a Series A in H1 2023 but now has the ability to be strategic and control their own destiny. In the conservative scenario, Evvy will hold off on 1-2 hires to maintain runway as it optimizes for the key milestones laid out above. This additional capital also gives them the flexibility to double down on growth as they continue to optimize their marketing channels, bring on additional team members to support enterprise partnerships, and continue to invest in their internal bioinformatics platform and analysis. At this point in the company's growth trajectory, there is still immense value in focusing on organic growth, learning from early users, exploring creative GTM strategies, and setting the company up for the ability to capture the future state they are starting to define for themselves.

## Exit Potential

Evvy's initial vaginal microbiome test and care delivery arm are a wedge into a broader opportunity to create a data and insights platform for all women. Real-world data (RWD) companies in other spaces (e.g., Flatiron, Tempus, OM1, etc) have built huge businesses by providing value to patients/providers for the privilege to collect valuable data assets, generating clinical-grade data through internal data expertise, and generating clear and tangible insights for patients, physicians, and enterprise customers. Evvy has shown significant promise and progress in all three of these areas.

After only 12 months, Evvy has gone above and beyond other bioinformatics and testing players (e.g., Jungla), which historically have a $50M-$100M exit potential, because of its advanced bioinformatics capabilities and unique data access. This rapid progress gives the company the optionality to build many possible futures. With this $100M exit scenario as the floor, we evaluated multiple scenarios based on previous comps to better understand what Evvy can become.

*   **$300M - $500M exit based on patient-facing technology and early adoption comps (<10K patients):** Ciitizen, a mobile personal health record focused in rare disease, autoimmune, and oncology, was acquired by Invitae in 2021 for $325M. Ciitizen raised $20M had built a scalable patient application, a robust data back-end and infrastructure, but, unlike Evvy has already shown, failed to grow its overall patient base and drive significant engagement amongst users
*   **$500M - $1B Exit based on care delivery multiples comps:** If all Evvy does is utilize its testing business as a revenue-neutral customer acquisition channel for its care delivery business, it has the potential to scale similarly to Women's Health care providers (e.g., Tia $900M valuation, Maven $1B valuation). High-growth care delivery companies can be valued in the 6x-10x annual revenue multiple range and beyond.
*   **$1B+ Exit based on personalized medicine companies in other indications:** Many of the largest and most successful companies in the personalized medicine space to-date (e.g., Flatiron, Tempus) have been in oncology space because of the overall market size and R&D spend. Comparatively, the R&D spend to-date in women's health is lower today because of many factors. Chief among them are the fact that innovation in women's health is hindered because conditions are not fatal (as opposed to oncology, for example) and the inability and unwillingness for pharma companies to expand beyond contraception to address the majority of the untapped $61B women's health market (slide 37). The autoimmune space, a similarly “non-fatal” area which includes Humira (the greatest selling drug of all time launched in 2003 by Abbott), went through a similar evolution. Over the last 10 years, venture funding for autoimmune has increased almost 10x ($201M in 2012, $1.9B in 2021) as the classic “fast-follower” mentality in the pharmaceutical industry inspired others to enter the space. Today, Bayer, Organon (Merck), Myovant, and others are pushing the women's health space forward in a similar manner.
