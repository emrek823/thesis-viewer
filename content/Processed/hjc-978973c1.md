## Slide 7: Journeyer Experience

Confidential and Privileged

**Journeyer Experience**

**Designed for authenticity, growth, and connection.**

We take the most clinically rigorous methodologies and adapt them to meet the needs of the next
generation, contextualized to their lives and embedded in their existing online communities

(Images show:
1. Illustrations of young adults in various poses.
2. A Minecraft screenshot with text overlay: "What's an example of an unhealthy coping mechanism that no longer works for you? JannikDE".
3. A Discord channel screenshot with various channels like #daily-gas-station, #introductions, #kudos, #memes, #pets-and-plants, #daily-checkin, #advice, #just-venting, #gaming-clips. A specific message from "Lyte 06/06/2022" discusses cognitive dissonance and self-worth.

## Slide 8: Gamification is not Game Design

Confidential and Privileged

**Gamification is not Game Design**

**At their best, games provide structured**
**experiences that facilitate discovery,**
**mastery, and growth.**

We use game design to drive really engaging and sticky experiences so that
Journeyers manifest the meaningful lives they yearn for. We started with the
core treatment experience and are now productizing the experience.

**Motivation**
Members join us because they
feel broken and want a path to
becoming happy, whole,
unmessy, valued, contented,
enough. Feel "okay."

**Mastery**
Reframe, work through
challenges. Map CBT/DBT tools
to their lives, show up, do the
work. Become more comfortable
engaging in vulnerability and
connection.

**Feedback Loops**
Immediate positive
reinforcement for sharing,
reflecting, accountability from
therapist and peers. Tracking of
symptom improvement. Level
up announcements

**Goals:** Autonomy, mastery, self reliance, connection, belonging, peace of mind, control, growth, resilience

**Examples:** You can be as happy as we are (relatedness), you can get there too (competence), we will give
you the tools you need to figure it out (autonomy, mastery), with a crew behind you (connection). You're not
broken (belonging).

## Slide 11: Journeyer Love

Confidential and Privileged

**Journeyer Love**

**We're more than just mental health**
**support, we're a place to belong.**

“I've been here for a while and I've really enjoyed
everything you're doing here. It's helped more
than any 1x1 therapy I've tried so far honestly.
I've just been trying to get my depression under
control. I struggle a lot, but I find myself looking
forward to these sessions every week.”

**Allie Renee** recommends **Hero Journey**
**Club.**
Jun 6 •
HJC has honestly been life changing for me. I'd never
found a therapist I've connected with so well before and
I've never had the experience of a therapeutic community
like this one before. I've felt significantly better since
starting sessions with them and can actually feel some of
my less than beneficial habits finally loosening their grip.
Honestly couldn't recommend the fantastic humans who
run HJC more!

**Beignet Boo** recommends **Hero Journey**
**Club.**
Jun 11 •
I've been an active member of HJC since I first joined the
public Discord in February 11th, 2022. I was curious to see
if it was actually good or not, and was surprised to see it
was filled with genuine, hardworking people who cared
tremendously about the well-being of others, regardless if
you were a paying member. I'm 17 years old, kind of in the
beginning of my "coming of age" stage and currently trying
to not let C-PTSD control my life anymore. These people
have been the best support I've ever had. They've held
hundreds of clinical journey groups as well as dozens of
fun public community quests/events, so just so it's out
there, these people really care. (And they're also very
professional.)

Not only have I gotten great advice, helpful resources, and
valuable mental health information, I definitely feel like I'm
a stronger, more stable individual since joining. I'm
incredibly grateful that I get to be a part of HJC. :-) To
those struggling mentally, emotionally, or socially, maybe
give HJC a shot. The community is absolutely wonderful
and welcoming. We're pretty chill.

**Ainsley Stevielle**
I absolutely love Hero Journey Club! I have my
second session today, but even just being in the
discord server is so so helpful. Everyone works
really hard to make it a welcoming space and as
someone who tends to lurk in servers, I've
actually had a lot of good interactions there and
I tend to put myself out there more! I highly
recommend them to anyone considering it

an activity they find comforting while also taking
steps to improve mental health and coping
mechanisms. I love this.

**Izzy Truly**
I've been doing therapy with Hero Journey Club
for a couple months now. The therapists are
amazing and the people in my group super cool.
I'd put off looking into therapy for ages because
of my social anxiety but I figured this was
something I could handle. I'm so happy I did. If
you're thinking about it I definitely recommend
giving them a shot. It's honestly helping me a lot
and it's lot more affordable than most other
therapy options

## Slide 16: The future of mental health

Confidential and Privileged

**The future of mental health**

New tools for a new generation of needs. We will be the first healthcare service layer
in the metaverse. We will build the largest dataset available for GenZ mental health,
innovate new digital biomarkers for mental illness, and craft 'n of 1' support models
that are deeply personalized to specific phenotypes of depression and anxiety.

**Entry Point.**
We will be the entry point for
GenZ into our healthcare
system, given that behavioral
health is their top health
concern.

**Embedded.**
Care will be delivered in the
context of consumers' lives,
particularly as we shift our
lives to being more digital.

**Community.**
The future of mental health is
rooted in community healing,
not individual brokenness.

## Slide 17: Questions

**Questions**
**brian@herojourney.club**

“What if depression is, in fact, a form
of grief—for our own lives not being
as they should? What if it is a form
of grief for the connections we have
lost, yet still need?

You aren't a machine with broken
parts. You are an animal whose
needs are not being met.”

**Johann Hari, Lost Connections**

“It is impossible to understand
addiction without asking what
relief the addict finds, or hopes to
find, in the drug or the addictive
behaviour.

The question is not why the
addiction, but why the pain.”

**Dr. Gabor Mate, MD**
