## Abstract

Clinical diagnosis begins with doctor-patient interaction, during which physicians iteratively gather information, determine examination and refine differential diagnosis through patients' response. This dynamic clinical-reasoning process is poorly represented by existing LLM benchmarks that focus on static question-answering. To mitigate these gaps, recent methods explore dynamic medical frameworks involving interactive clinical dialogues. Although effective, they often rely on limited, contamination-prone datasets and lack granular, multi-level evaluation. In this work, we propose ClinDEF, a dynamic framework for assessing clinical reasoning in LLMs through simulated diagnostic dialogues. Grounded in a disease knowledge graph, our method dynamically generates patient cases and facilitates multi-turn interactions between an LLM-based doctor and an automated patient agent. Our evaluation protocol goes beyond diagnostic accuracy by incorporating fine-grained efficiency analysis and rubric-based assessment of diagnostic quality. Experiments show that ClinDEF effectively exposes critical clinical reasoning gaps in state-of-the-art LLMs, offering a more nuanced and clinically meaningful evaluation paradigm.
