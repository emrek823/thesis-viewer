## Exclusive: GSK to pay $50M to use Noetik's AI cancer models

**Andrew Dunn**

In a deal that Noetik's leaders call a new paradigm for AI-fo-cused biotech, GSK is paying millions to license AI models rather than drug candidates.

The British pharma giant is paying $50 million in upfront and short-term milestone payments to Noetik, a South San Francisco-based AI biotech that is, in turn, providing non-exclusive licenses to two proprietary models it has respec-tively trained for lung and colon cancer. The deal will be offi-cially announced Thursday morning, the companies exclu-sively told Endpoints News.

unique with its model focus. In addition to the $50 million, the five-year agreement includes GSK paying essentially an undisclosed annual subscription fee for access to these virtu-al cell models. Noetik will generate additional data for GSK's use and help integrate GSK's proprietary data with these models.

"It was really hard to contract because there wasn't a tem-plate for it," Alfa said. "We didn't have any comps ... This was a bit of a holy grail for the techbio community, because folks have wanted to do a deal like this."

'Rinse and repeat' potential

Noetik was founded in 2022 by two former Recursion re-search leaders. One of them, Jacob Rinaldi, left the company last summer after serving as Noetik's chief scientific officer and as a board member. The biotech raised a $40 million Se-ries A in 2024, focused on building AI models that simulate specific types of cancer cells. Its research focuses on the spa-tial transcriptomics of human tumor samples, or effectively analyzing which genes are active in cancer cells and where they are located within the tumor.

So far, Noetik has trained models on more than 10 different types of cancer, Alfa said. The GSK deal is focused on models for non-small cell lung cancer and colorectal cancer. That

Kim Branson, GSK's senior vice president and global head of artificial intelligence and machine learning, said in a state-ment provided to Endpoints that GSK plans on fine-tuning Noetik's models with specific GSK datasets for a range of us-es.

"We intend to use these models for both our existing pipeline programs and for earlier-stage work," Branson said. “These models will also complement our translational research, working alongside our existing efforts including patient-de-rived organoids to provide faster and more accurate insights into clinical safety and efficacy."

Alfa said Noetik's focus on spatial experiments and using tis-sue from human patients are the biggest differences with most of the so-called virtual cell field. Much of that research has focused on training AI models on large amounts of sin-gle-cell data — an approach that Alfa said loses necessary context of seeing where those cells are in the body.

"We think that context of the data you're using to train the models is going to be really impactful,” Alfa said, adding it's harder to work with human samples and do *in vivo* experi-ments.

Others in the field are taking easier approaches in using cell lines and studying single cells. But Alfa said the resulting models will be constrained by the limitations in that data. Noetik's models, for instance, show different simulations if a
