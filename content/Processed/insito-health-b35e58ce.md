## Slide 1: The modern digital prescription network
**insito health**

The modern digital prescription network
We're building the new standard for prescriptions to better serve patients, prescribers, pharmacies, and payers.

## Slide 2: Patients struggle to access medications today because they have no way to find the best pharmacy option for them
**insito health**

**Dialogue:**
*   **Doctor:** Where should I send your prescription?
*   **Patient:** Umm... I guess the CVS down the street

**Questions/Challenges for Patients:**
*   Which pharmacy has it in stock?
*   How much will it cost?
*   Will my insurance cover it?
*   Is it cheaper at a different pharmacy?
*   Is this pharmacy in network?
*   Should I pay with cash or insurance?
*   Which pharmacy coupon should I use?
*   Is there a manufacturer coupon?
*   Can I get it delivered to me?

## Slide 3: This is by design.
**insito health**

Today's E-prescribing network was built by incumbents to drive revenue & cost savings by limiting patient choice.

**Diagram:**
Doctor -> E-Rx -> Pharmacy

**E-Rx Powered by:**
*   surescripts

**Major Incumbent Pharmacies/PBMs:**
*   RITE AID
*   Walgreens (W logo)
*   EXPRESS SCRIPTS®
*   CVS caremark™
*   Walmart
*   Kroger

## Slide 4: Their network cut patients out of the transaction, creating problems for every player involved, including themselves.
**insito health**

**Problems Created by the Existing Network:**
*   **Doctors:** More Admin Work
*   **Pharmacy:** More Admin Work
*   **Payer:** Higher cost of care
*   **Pharma:** Decreased Revenues
*   **EHR:** Costs $ to Send Prescriptions
*   **PMS:** Costs $ to Receive Prescriptions
*   **Patient (center):** No way to check prices or availability

## Slide 5: We're building the modern digital prescription network that solves access & admin problems while creating value for every player.
