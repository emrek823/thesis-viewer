### TCAP Series A Diligence Issues

- Contribution margin discrepancies causing major delays
	- Financial diligence firm found 30-40% margins vs expected range
	- September salary/benefits number significantly higher than projections
	- Root causes identified:
- Emily (finance) confirmed legitimacy of diligence firm’s concerns
- Deal team now fixated on 7% margin differential despite cash vs accrual accounting differences

### Clinical Leadership Equity Dispute

- Clinical co-founders discovered fundraise details (likely through SharePoint access)
	- Had admin rights to Office 365, found investor relations documents
	- Now claiming equity allocation unfair despite signed 5% offer letters
	- Demanding equal co-founder treatment after years of agreed structure
- No legal case or demand letters yet (reps/warranties not triggered)
- Plans to transition them out anyway by January/February with new clinical hires
- Proposed resolution: accelerate departure with release of claims + follow-on investor buyout of vested equity (~$1M, convert to preferred)

### Partnership Test Decision

- Considering informing TCAP about HR issue as transparency test
	- Gauge their response to real business challenge
	- Determine if they act as true partners vs transaction-focused
- Two potential outcomes:
- If TCAP walks, alternative: smaller round with existing investors at lower valuation

### Exclusivity Timeline Pressure

- Current exclusivity expires tonight (14 hours remaining)
- Concha indicated willingness to extend but checking Emre’s position
- Unprecedented level of micro-diligence for Series A stage
- Legal fees already at $150k with potential for no deal completion
- Strategy: honor exclusivity through midnight, then reassess leverage position

### Next Steps

- Call with Jared today to discuss HR situation and gauge response
- If exclusivity expires without resolution: go silent for weekend, force TCAP to make move
- Prepared to walk if partnership dynamics don’t improve
- Alternative funding options available through existing investors if needed
