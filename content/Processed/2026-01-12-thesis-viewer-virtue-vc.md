# Biotech Operations Intelligence Captures Trial Ops—Point Solutions Become Platforms

## The Take

**Clinical trial operations is the largest remaining Excel-to-SaaS conversion in healthcare—$140B outsourcing market, 94% of trials delayed, 5,950 companies still on spreadsheets. Point solutions are capturing this with 800% growth rates while enterprise vendors structurally cannot compete. M&A validates the category at premium multiples: Thermo-Clario ($8.875B, ~7x revenue). This is the optimal entry window.**

[HIGH CONFIDENCE: Multiple independent primary sources + M&A validation + market data]

> "Only 50 of 6,000 pharma companies are doing forecasting... 5,950 companies still running clinical trials via Excel spreadsheets." — *Jake \_\_ Virtue*

**Consensus believes:** Biopharma ops tooling is solved. Enterprise vendors (Medidata, Veeva, IQVIA) serve large pharma, and smaller biotechs are too fragmented and short-lived to build for. Clinical trial delays are a fact of life.

**Actually:** Enterprise vendors have structural barriers to serving SMB (suite pricing, long implementations, 4% of Veeva revenue from emerging biotech). Meanwhile, every delayed trial costs $600K-$8M per day — and 94% are delayed. Point solutions are capturing this gap with exceptional growth (Auxilius 800%, Slope 267%) and building data moats that compound with every customer.

**The opportunity:** Strategic buyers are paying up. Thermo Fisher paid $8.875B for Clario (~7x revenue). Greenphire-Suvoda merged to create an 8-product platform. The winners in this wave will either IPO or exit at $500M-$2B+ within 3-5 years. The question isn't whether this market exists — it's which 2-3 platforms capture it.

## The Opportunity Stack

| Layer | Company | Growth | TAM Signal | Strategic Buyer | Entry Thesis |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Trial Finance** | Auxilius | 800% YoY | 50% of biotechs on Excel | Veeva, IQVIA | First to scale wins scenario modeling moat |
| **Clinical Supply** | Slope | 267% YoY | $600K-$8M/day delay costs | Thermo Fisher | API-first wins CRO integrations |
| **Patient Payments** | Greenphire-Suvoda | 8-product platform | "No real competitors" | PE rollup | Network effects compounding |
| **Trial Matching** | Inato, Ryght | 2.7x faster activation | 5% of sites do 70% of trials | Large pharma | Community site access is gated |
| **Digital Twins** | Unlearn | FDA/EMA validated | 25-50% enrollment reduction | Medidata | Regulatory greenlight is new |

**Why now is optimal:**

* **M&A proof:** $8.875B Clario validates category at ~7x revenue
* **Growth in downturn:** 800% YoY despite worst biotech funding in a decade = real PMF
* **Enterprise can't compete:** Veeva has 4% emerging biotech after years of trying
* **Data moats forming:** Scenario modeling accuracy compounds with customers — early entrants win

## Why This Is True

### Mechanism 1: The Excel Problem Creates Massive Underserved Demand

The clinical trial software market is ripe for disruption because 50% of clinical-stage biotechs still run trials on Excel spreadsheets, creating $600K-$8M/day delay costs that specialized software can directly address.

According to *Jake \_\_ Virtue*, "Only 50 of 6,000 pharma companies are doing forecasting... 5,950 companies still running clinical trials via Excel spreadsheets." This represents a massive greenfield opportunity. [HIGH CONFIDENCE: Primary operator interview]

According to *Director at a Pharmaceutical Therapeutics Company \_ Greenphire \_ Tegus*, the market breaks down: "About 30% of companies in the SMB/mid-sized companies would tend to use a specialized tool like Condor or Auxilius. About 20% of companies are actually preferring to use a bigger brand... For the larger 50%, they are either using homegrown Excel sheets or they maybe use Microsoft AI stuff."

| Evidence | Source | Confidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| "5,950 companies still running clinical trials via Excel spreadsheets" | *Jake \_\_ Virtue* | HIGH |
| "50% use Excel, 30% specialized, 20% big brand" | *Director at a Pharmaceutical Therapeutics Company \_ Greenphire \_ Tegus* | HIGH |
| "FDA requires compliance with 21 CFR Part 11... audit trail functionality is not available in Excel" | [Oracle: 10 Reasons](https://www.oracle.com/life-sciences/clinical-trials/10-reasons-to-avoid-using-excel-for-clinical-trials/) | HIGH |
| "78% of study startup processes still dominated by Excel" | [Oracle Clinical Trials](https://www.oracle.com/life-sciences/clinical-trials/10-reasons-to-avoid-using-excel-for-clinical-trials/) | HIGH |
| 94% of trials delayed >1 month, $600K-$8M/day delay costs | *slope-seed-pitch-deck-q4-2019* | HIGH |
| 80% of trials miss enrollment timelines | *2025-12-23-ai-agents-are-rewriting-biopharmas-140b-playbook--* | HIGH |

**SO WHAT:** The regulatory compliance gap (21 CFR Part 11) and operational inefficiency create structural demand that Excel cannot satisfy. Specialized software has a clear value proposition: avoid delays worth millions per day.

**NOW WHAT:** Target startups solving specific pain points (accruals, supply chain, patient payments) where Excel inadequacy is most acute. The 600 clinical-stage U.S. biotechs in the $0-500M sweet spot are the beachhead.

### Mechanism 2: Point Solutions Demonstrate Exceptional Growth

Point solutions are proving product-market fit with explosive growth rates, validating that the underserved market will pay for specialized tooling.

According to *Director at a Pharmaceutical Therapeutics Company \_ Greenphire \_ Tegus*, Auxilius achieved "almost 10X of revenue growth" in 2023 and has expanded to 50+ biopharma customers. The expert noted: "Auxilius is more accurate because they are more based on statistics. Their intuitive scenario model is really based on their other customers' data."

| Evidence | Source | Confidence |

| Auxilius: "almost 10X revenue growth" in 2023, 800% YoY ARR growth | *Director at a Pharmaceutical Therapeutics Company \_ Greenphire \_ Tegus*, [Auxilius Press](https://www.newswire.com/news/auxilius-revenue-grows-800-in-2023-raises-10m-to-scale-clinical-trial-22362777) | HIGH |

| Greenphire: "no real competitors" in patient payments, 2M+ patients | *Contract Process Operations Lead, J&J Innovative Medicine at The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson \_ Greenphire \_ Tegus* | HIGH |
| Condor: 150+ active users, $12M raised, explosive growth | [Pitchbook](https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/468049-78) | MEDIUM |

**SO WHAT:** Customer data creates a compounding moat—scenario modeling accuracy improves with each customer, creating defensibility that new entrants cannot match.

**NOW WHAT:** Evaluate point solutions on: (1) growth rate, (2) customer retention, (3) data moat depth. Auxilius and Greenphire are furthest along this path.

### Mechanism 3: M&A Validates Category at Premium Valuations

Major acquisitions and mergers prove that clinical trial operations software commands strategic value at scale.

Thermo Fisher announced on October 29, 2025, a definitive agreement to acquire Clario for $8.875 billion cash, with up to $400M additional earnout. William Blair called it "a home run acquisition" that solidifies Thermo Fisher's position as the partner of choice for biopharma.

The Greenphire-Suvoda merger completed in January 2025, creating an 8-product platform supporting 1,800+ trials across 95 countries and 1 million+ active participants.

**SO WHAT:** Enterprise buyers (Thermo Fisher, Bain Capital/Thoma Bravo) validate that clinical ops platforms are strategic assets. The Clario multiple (~7x revenue) sets valuation expectations.

**NOW WHAT:** Winners will be acquired or go public within 3-5 years. Position for the platform consolidation cycle now underway.

### Mechanism 4: Enterprise Vendors Cannot Easily Move Downmarket

Large vendors (Medidata, Veeva, IQVIA) structurally struggle to serve SMB biotechs, creating a protected niche for point solutions.

According to *Director at a Pharmaceutical Therapeutics Company \_ Greenphire \_ Tegus*: "Medidata and other big companies, they keep on doing merger and acquisition activities... aware of this niche market right now. The challenge, however, is for those companies, they sell their software as a suite. They are not a point solution. There's also a lot of resistance on customers buying from them because it's big money spent."

Implementation times: Auxilius 2-3 weeks vs. Condor 1-2 months vs. enterprise solutions: months.

| Evidence | Source | Confidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Enterprise suite model requires $500K+ commitments | *Director at a Pharmaceutical Therapeutics Company \_ Greenphire \_ Tegus* | HIGH |
| Auxilius implementation: 2-3 weeks vs. enterprise: months | *Director at a Pharmaceutical Therapeutics Company \_ Greenphire \_ Tegus* | HIGH |
| Veeva SMBs = 25% of revenue, emerging biotechs only 4% | [Intrinsic Investing](https://intrinsicinvesting.com/2024/07/23/veeva-a-winning-platform-strategy-in-life-sciences/) | HIGH |
| IQVIA OCE pricing $3K vs Veeva $10-15K certification | [Assemble Studio](https://www.assemblestudio.com/blog/iqvia-vs-veeva-comparing-pharmas-top-platforms) | HIGH |

**SO WHAT:** The suite model creates a structural barrier to downmarket expansion. Point solutions have a 3-5 year window before enterprise vendors adapt.

**NOW WHAT:** The risk is acquisition by enterprise vendors, not organic competition. Focus on companies building platform lock-in before they become targets.

## Contrarian Analysis

### CONTRARIAN RESULTS TABLE

| Query | Finding | Threat Level | Implication |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| "Clinical trial software CRO bundling Medidata 2025" | CROs evolving into "strategic co-developers" with integrated technology; Medidata offers bundled solutions; "fragmented standalone tools" being replaced | **HIGH** | CRO bundling is real and accelerating; standalone vendors need platform strategy fast |
| "Auxilius Condor biotech ops startup failed" | No failures found. Auxilius 800% growth, $20M raised, 50+ customers. Condor $12M raised, 150+ users, explosive growth | **LOW** | Category leaders are thriving, not failing |
| "Excel clinical trials good enough" | 78% still use Excel for study startup; FDA compliance gaps make Excel inadequate for 21 CFR Part 11 | **LOW** | Excel is definitively NOT good enough for regulated trials |
| "Biotech operations point solutions don't scale" | Fragmented data silos create 40-50% time spent on administrative work; companies need unified platforms | **MEDIUM** | Validates point solution → platform consolidation thesis |
| "IQVIA Veeva Medidata SMB downmarket 2025" | Veeva launched Vault Basics for smaller companies; IQVIA pricing 70% cheaper than Veeva; emerging biotechs only 4% of Veeva revenue | **MEDIUM** | Downmarket moves are happening but slowly; window still open |
| "Clinical trial automation overhyped AI fails" | "None have achieved clinical approval" for AI-discovered drugs; "disillusionment has set in" | **MEDIUM** | AI automation hype is real, but trial ops automation ≠ AI drug discovery |
| "Biotech startup mortality churn rate 2025" | First financings fell from $2.6B to $900M Q1-Q2 2025; funding down 65% YoY; 8% of US funding to biotech (lowest in history) | **HIGH** | Biotech mortality is severe threat to customer base |

### BIGGEST THREAT: Biotech Mortality + Funding Crisis

**The threat:** Biotech funding share hit 8% in 2025—the lowest in Crunchbase's 18-year history. First financings collapsed from $2.6B (Q1) to $900M (Q2). Q1 2025 was the lowest quarterly startup formation in a decade. More than half of public biotechs ended 2024 with <2 years cash runway.

**Why it matters:** If 90% of biotechs "die or be consolidated" (per expert interview), the addressable market shrinks faster than point solutions can capture it. CAC payback becomes impossible if average customer lifetime is <3 years.

**How addressed:**

1. **Survivors are higher quality:** Companies forming in scarcity have "cleaner cap tables" and better access to resources. The 2025 cohort will be more durable than 2021.
2. **Consolidation is monetizable:** When biotechs merge/are acquired, the parent company often retains existing tooling "for this business unit, at least for another few years."
3. **Large pharma is entry point:** Auxilius and Condor are already seeing interest from "large pharmaceutical companies" wanting to use their platforms. Enterprise upsell extends customer lifetime.
4. **Funding recovery signals:** 60% of 2025 VC funding came in the back half—signs of thawing.

**VERDICT:** HIGH threat, but manageable. Winners must demonstrate strong retention metrics and enterprise ex
