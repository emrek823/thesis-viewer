## Slide 6: The Problem

The Problem

## Slide 7: Problem: Limited Demand, High Overhead

### Serving the Long-Tail of Requestor is Hard

*   **Limited Demand**
    Managing the longtail of Requestors adds admin burden and compliance risk—with little return.
*   **High Tech Burden**
    Most Requestors can't implement your APIs, let alone work across multiple vendors.
*   **Lack of Standardization**
    Every request is different—making intake automation tough and scaling expensive.

This slide includes a chart showing "Record Requests" on the Y-axis and "Customers" on the X-axis, depicting a long-tail distribution where a small number of customers generate many requests, and a large number of customers generate few requests.

## Slide 8: Solution: Hermes Unity Platform

### Hermes Unity Platform

*   **Unified UI**: Platform and API that enables Requestors to compliantly submit and receive requests for identified data requests.
*   **Unified Partner Integrations**: A robust backend that delivers identified back to Requestors by integrating with Partners.
    *   50 ROI Vendors
    *   500 EHR Vendors
    *   100 RWD Sources

This slide includes a diagram of the Hermes Unity Platform:
- Multiple "Requester" entities connect to "Hermes - Middleware".
- "Hermes - Middleware" connects to "ROI Vendors", "RWD Sources", "EHR Vendors", and "Clinics".

## Slide 9: More Revenue, Less Cost, and Scalable Intake

### Value to Partners

*   **More Demand: More Revenue**
    Hermes simplifies for Requestors the process of requesting and receiving medical records inducing demand for your data.
*   **No Tech Burden: Less Cost**
    Hermes handles integrations with Requestors so you don't have to manage one-off tech support or maintain multiple custom interfaces.
*   **Scalable Intake: Less Cost**
    Every record request arrives in a single, standardized format via Hermes—regardless of who sent it. That means lower operational cost, faster routing, and simplified scaling.

This slide includes a diagram showing multiple "Requester" icons connecting to "HERMES MIDDLEWARE". The middleware then connects to:
- ROI Vendor
- RWD Source
- EHR Vendor
- Clinics

## Slide 10: Hermes Data Network

### Middleware that Connects Requestors with Partners

*   **Requestors**: Requestors submit record requests
*   **Partners**: Fulfill record requests to Requestors through the Hermes middleware.

### Why It Matters

*   Single API integration replaces hundreds of point-to-point connections, reducing complexity and maintenance overhead.
*   Cloud-native infrastructure that grows with your business, handling millions of requests with consistent performance.

This slide includes a diagram identical to slide 9, showing multiple "Requester" icons connecting to "HERMES MIDDLEWARE". The middleware then connects to:
- ROI Vendor
- RWD Source
- EHR Vendor
- Clinics

## Slide 12: Hermes Data Network

    -   HIPAA compliance (magnifying glass over HIPAA text)
    -   Data processing (a stylized data icon)
    -   Location and data verification (map pin, checklist, data icon)
    These pre-processed requests flow into "Hermes Middleware".
-   **Hermes Middleware**: Represented by the Hermes Health logo. It connects to the "Partner Network".
-   **Partner Network**: Includes several logos and categories:
    -   mro
    -   verisma
    -   sharecare
    -   Claims Datasets
    -   ROI Vendors (generic icon)
    These partners then lead to "Medical Data".
-   **Medical Data**: Represented by a "MEDICAL RECORD" icon with a plus sign, signifying the output.

## Slide 13: Network Flywheel Effect

### Two-Sided Marketplace

Hermes Health connects Requestors with Partners creating value for both sides:

*   **Partners Benefit Via:**
    *   Increased Requests from Requestors increasing Partner revenue.
    *   Reduced fulfillment costs by switching Requestors to API submission vs Fax.
*   **Requestors Benefit Via:**
    *   Simplified record submission and delivery increasing, enabling increased demand for more requests.
    *   Improved turnaround times.

This slide includes a flywheel diagram titled "Hermes Health Flywheel Effect".
- **More Requestors** (top right) leads to
- **More Record Volume** (bottom right) which leads to
- **More Vendors Integrate to Capture Volume** (bottom left) which leads to
- **Faster and Easier Records** (top left) which leads back to
- **More Requestors**.

## Slide 14: Neutrality is Our Superpower

### Neutrality is our Super Power

Hermes Health operates as a neutral intermediary, facilitating interactions between Requestors and it Partners.

*   **Protected Business Intelligence**
    *   Your customer lists and business relationships remain confidential.
    *   Pricing agreements and contract terms are not shared with competitors.
    *   Operational metrics and capacity information stays private.
*   **Fair Market Access**
    *   Equal opportunity to participate in request fulfillment.

This slide features a large red image of Switzerland with a white cross, symbolizing neutrality.

## Slide 15: Levels of Data Partners

This slide shows a hierarchical pyramid illustrating levels of data partners.

### Level 3: Full Medical Record - Retrieval

- **Pyramid Top**: Full Medical Record (Yellow)

### Level 2: Basic Data - Filter
Partners who provide basic health data such medication, lab results, diagnoses, patient demographics.
- **Pyramid Middle**: Basic Data Elements (Cyan)

### Level 1: Provider Data - Discover
Partners that supply provider-specific information such as NPI numbers and facility identifiers.
- **Pyramid Base**: Provider Data (Blue)

## Slide 16: Partnership Framework

## Slide 17: Hermes Reduces Your Legal Exposure

### Contracting & Liability

Hermes signs agreements with both the Requestor and the Partner.

*   **Requestors attest that HIPAA Authorization submissions are valid and accurate.**
*   **Partners attest:**
    *   That they have the right to release identified medical data assuming a valid HIPAA Authorization.
    *   That they are releasing the correct data for the patient requested
*   **Hermes Health attests that patient data is securely handled and transmitted to the appropriate party.**

This slide includes a flowchart illustrating the liability distribution:

| Entity         | Attestation                                                 | Holds Liability                                     |
| :------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| Requestor      | Attest that HIPAA Authorizations are Valid and Accurate     | Holds the Liability for Inappropriate Record Submissions |
| Hermes Health  | Attest that Patient Data is Secured and transmitted to the appropriate party | Holds the Liability for Inappropriate Record Disclosures |
| Partner        | Attest that Records released are for the patient requested  | Holds the Liability for Inappropriate Disclosure    |

## Slide 18: Solution: How it Works

### First Neutral API for Identified Health Data

The Hermes Health Unity Platform connects Requestors to a growing network of Partners—including ROI vendors, EHR systems, and RWD providers. How it works:

*   **Secure Intake**: Requestors securely submit patient's full name, date of birth, and a signed HIPAA Authorization form.
*   **Smart Routing**: The Unity Platform then routes these requests to our network of Partners.
*   **Partner Fulfillment**: Our Partner networks processes these Requests and securely transmits identified patient data back to the Unity Platform.
*   **Delivery**: The Unity Platform securely delivers the data back to requestors without revealing Partner-specific infrastructure or exposing individual Partner details, protecting privacy, and confidentiality
*   **Transparent Pricing**: Each Partner is paid a clear, per-record fee to keep pricing simple and aligned.

This slide features a diagram showing the flow:
1.  **Requestor** submits via "Secure Intake" and "Secure Delivery" to the "Unity Platform".
2.  **Unity Platform** uses "Partner Route Engine" to route requests.
3.  **Partner Route Engine** directs to "Partner (ROI, EHR, or RWD)".
4.  **Partner** interacts with "Facility" to process requests.
5.  **Partner** transmits "Patient Data Retrieved" back to "Unity Platform" via "API Delivery".
6.  **Unity Platform** delivers "Patient Data" back to the "Requestor".

## Slide 19: Simple, Aligned Economics

### Simple Pricing

*   Hermes Health will integrate with your platform at no cost.
*   Hermes Health will pay the Partner on a per patient or record retrieved.

| Category                  | Price                     |
| :------------------------ | :------------------------ |
| Hermes Health Integration | Free                      |
| Record Transaction Fee    | $5 - $50 (Based on Partner Dataset) |
