‍***In this paper we 1) identify several barriers that investors face when making capital allocation decisions for women’s health investment opportunities, and 2) identify existing impactful policies that if re-focused on women’s health could promote investment.**  
‍

Prioritizing women’s health is essential, not only for the well-being of women, but also for the continued economic prosperity of our society. The market size for women’s health is estimated to be $45.5B in 2025 and is expected to grow at a 6.3% CAGR to $58.1B by 2029.1

For innovation to reach women in medicine, diagnostics, and health care overall, different pools of capital are required to successfully navigate new products through discovery, development, and commercialization.    
   
Today, there is a “push” of capital to women’s health from the government and early seed funding, and a “pull” to acquire and invest in new commercial products from corporations and late-stage investors. However, there is a lack of  capital that typically funds promising technology to commercialization.  

‍

‍

**We make the following recommendations to investors, government, industry, and advocacy groups on how we can work together to increase the flow of capital to innovation in women’s health.**

Recommendations for Investors:

* Become more educated about women’s health
* Bring together investors, acquirers and government to encourage collaboration and co-investment
* Invest in emerging fund managers focused on women’s health
* Raise $1B+ venture fund dedicated to women’s health  
  ‍

Recommendations for Government:

* Understand the role private investment plays in innovation, health and medicine to reach patients
* Evaluate current initiatives that, if directed with a lens to women’s health, could reduce barriers for private investors
  + Food and Drug Administration (FDA): apply existing policies to women’s health products that help reduce risk of investment in expensive clinical trials
  + National Institutes of Health (NIH): fund basic research in women’s health so that we have the biology to develop effective and safe medicines for women
  + Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS): provide proactive clarity on reimbursement process and timing  
    ‍

Recommendations for Industry and Advocacy Groups:

* Work with leaders in women’s health to educate government about how private capital is essential for innovation to reach patients and how government can help unlock private investment
* Collect and analyze data to support policy changes and continue to solicit recommendations from the investment community
* Help educate investors, government and communities about women’s health via talking to doctors, industry, and educators to make women’s health a topic that is important to address today

## I. Problem & Opportunity

Today there is a tremendous opportunity to improve women’s health. It’s an opportunity to invest capital, spur innovation, and enable the nearly four billion mothers, daughters, sisters, and wives across the United States and around the world to live better, healthier lives.   
‍

Investment in scientific research, drug discovery, diagnostics, product development, and commercialization for women’s health will positively impact families, communities, societies and future generations. And the market is enormous. Women make up more than half the U.S. population. How is it, then, that companies working in such a critical market attract a paltry 2% of the venture funding allocated to the entire U.S. healthcare industry?2 With all this opportunity, why the glaring gap? What and where are the barriers to investment? Who and what encourages financing? And how can public-private partnerships work to unlock the flow of capital to catalyze innovation in women’s health?

For the purposes of this paper we focus on regulated categories, such as therapeutics, medical devices and diagnostics, and over-the-counter (OTC) products, and we are defining women’s health as conditions that affect:

1. Women exclusively
2. Women disproportionately to men
3. Women differently than men

‍

**The goals of this paper are to:**

1. Build understanding about the flow of capital to women’s health
2. Remove barriers keeping capital from permeating this critical space
3. Encourage sustained investment for the benefit of society at large

## II. Background

Women and men are not the same. When they experience similar health challenges, however, they are often treated as if they are. This can have debilitating, even deadly consequences. Over the past forty years, most of the drugs pulled off the U.S. market have been due to toxicities and safety issues in women. 34 This danger points to a fundamental misunderstanding of the biological differences between males and females that begins at the level of basic research. Scientists have studied male bodies at a far higher rate than female bodies. But the inequities don’t end there. They continue through drug development, data collection and clinical trials. The result is that treatments don’t work as well on women and in some cases even harm them.

Congressional Research Service. “Orphan Drugs: Incentives for Research and Development”. R47653, 2023.

Women experience a myriad of conditions men simply do not, as well as ailments that affect them differently from men or show up more often than in men. To date, however, the amount of investment in research and innovative therapies does not reflect serious or sustained acknowledgement of these facts.

**Health and Funding Disparities for Women:**

Men and women have a similar rate of heart attacks, but women die from them more frequently and it is not clear why.5

  

---

  

Women have twice the risk of Alzheimer’s and yet clinical trials on dementia don’t report the differences in safety and efficacy by sex.6

  

---

  

80% of individuals suffering from autoimmune diseases are women but how these diseases work is largely unknown.7

  

---

  

60% of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients are women and yet just 7%
of the 2019 National Institutes of Health $86 million budget for RA went to research focused on women.8

  

---

  

There is still no way to diagnose or cure endometriosis without surgery and many women continue to experience pain, fatigue, and infertility afterwards.9

  

---

  

Girls and women have depression and anxiety at higher rates than boys and men but there isn’t adequate evidence to explain why.10

  

---

  

The U.S. continues to have the highest maternal death rate among high-income nations.11 In 2023, the maternal mortality rate in the U.S. was approximately 18.6 deaths per 100,000 live births; for Black women, this rate was 50.3 deaths per 100,000 live births.12

  

---

  

In almost 75% of cases, when a disease predominantly affects one gender, funding is skewed in favor of men—either because diseases that impact more women are underfunded relative to their burden, or because diseases that primarily affect men are overfunded relative to their burden.13

  

---

  

This gender-based funding disparity, when measured relative to disease burden, is nearly twice as large for diseases that predominantly affect men compared to those that primarily affect women.14

Women’s health has a far-reaching impact not just on themselves, but on their families, communities, and broader society. Studies show that healthier women contribute to more productive, well-educated societies, while the death of a mother can cause a significant decline in the health, nutrition, and economic well-being of her family and community.15 Women’s health must be prioritized to promote both public health and economic growth. Women’s health issues, particularly those related to chronic conditions and mental health, are responsible for a large portion of healthcare expenditures in the U.S., with the costs related to these conditions impacting women disproportionately.16

Despite women representing 51% of the global population and 67% of the global health and social care workforce, their healthcare needs are often still treated as a niche issue.19

## III. Sources of Capital and the Current Funding Environment for Women’s Health

Several different pools of capital are required for innovation in women’s health to reach patients, including: **Funding for Basic Research**‍

Funding for basic research in women’s health is the first step toward improving understanding of the biology behind women-specific conditions as well as how other conditions affect men and women differently. Understanding the underlying biology of diseases specific to women will enable the discovery of new medicines that are effective and safe. The current lack of validated biology for women’s health conditions significantly limits the extent of drug development by increasing uncertainty and risk of failure. Furthermore, between 2013 and 2023, an average of only 8.8% of NIH grants were allocated to women’s health research each year, and over that decade, the proportion of funding to women’s health decreased from 9.7% of the FY 2013 budget total to 7.9% in FY 2023 despite an increase in the overall budget.23

While there was an increased focus from the federal government on funding women’s health in 2024, it is unclear at this time if these funds, aimed to improve this disparity, will be appropriated.    
‍

2024 U.S. Government Funding for Women’s Health:

* $100M funded from the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H)
* $500M committed from the Pentagon
* $558M committed from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for maternal mortality research and prevention
  + $440M from the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) for maternal and infant health services
  + $118M from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for maternal mortality infrastructure
* $12B requested from Congress by the Biden administration

**Seed-Stage Financing**  
Early-stage financing through venture capital is crucial for both transitioning innovations from government or academic settings into a corporate structure and supporting the exploration of high-risk, high-reward projects atypical for traditional sources of funding. Over the past few years, there have been several seed funds dedicated to financing innovation in women’s health, enabling a pipeline of companies to begin product development; Foreground Capital, SteelSky Ventures, and Avestria Ventures are three examples. However, while these funds have both spurred and supported many new women’s health companies, they are limited in their ability to
