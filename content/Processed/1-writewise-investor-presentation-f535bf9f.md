## Slide 3: The Chaos of PBM RFPs and Historical Claims Repricing
### Traditional Repricing Challenges
*   **8-10 Weeks**
    *   Reprice is historical, not next year's risk

### Workflow Steps & Challenges
*   **Data Collection**
    *   9/15
    *   **Who's Validating?**

        2.  Limited Information
        3.  No Pharmacy Manual
        4.  Lack of Transparanecy
*   **Repricing**
    *   10/22
    *   **Outdated & Inaccurate Process**
        1.  Long & Tedious Process
        2.  Channel Discounts are Arbitrary & Speculative
        3.  Only Historical Repricings
*   **Comparison Analysis**
    *   10/10
    *   **Stakeholder Increase Expectations Near The Effective Date**
        1.  Ask for Additional Scenarios
        2.  Adjustments to Groups
        3.  Big 3 PBM's Comes back with a lower number you need to beat
*   **Reporting Results**
    *   12/1
    *   **Is The Proposal**
        1.  Transparent?
        2.  Validated?
        3.  Accurate?
        4.  Competitive Enough to Close?
*   **Effective Date**

## Slide 8: Path to $100 million ARR with recurring revenue and 80%+ gross margins. No heroic assumptions

*   **750k Employees**
    *   1% of 80 million U.S. employees under self-insured benefits in the U.S.
*   **X**
*   **$11 PEPM**
    *   Consistent with first 30k members live on WriteWise

## Slide 9: Fixed Cost Product 1: PMPM Guarantee
Why do plan sponsors want a PMPM Guarantee?

*   **Alignment**
    *   A PMPM Guarantee aligns the interests of the PBM and Plan Sponsor by incentivizing the PBM to effectively manage the program and penalizing them if they don't
*   **Accountability**
    *   A PMPM Guarantee is the simplest and most effective way to hold a PBM accountable for their management of the plan
*   **Certainty**
    *   Budgetary certainty is provided to the Plan Sponsor by capping the plan's financial exposure
*   **Comparability**
    *   A PMPM Guarantee is the simplest way to evaluate PBM's in an RFP setting by reducing the impact of all other variables

## Slide 10: PBM Sets PMPM Guarantee with or w/o Protection ("PBM Protect")
### Chart Data: PBM Sets PMPM Guarantee with or w/o Protection ("PBM Protect")
This chart illustrates the financial risk transfer in a PBM Guarantee model with and without protection.

| Metric                 | Value/Threshold |
| :--------------------- | :-------------- |
| PMPM Guarantee (PBM Contract w/ Group) | $100            |
| PBM Fee's @ Risk       | Between $100 and $110 (corresponding to 60% and 80% marks) |
| PBM Protect (WW Contract w/ PBM) | $110            |
| Transferred Risk       | Between $110 and $120 (corresponding to 80% and 95% marks) |
| Risk Upper Bound (Group's Stop Loss Insurance) | $120            |
| Risk Percentage 1      | 60%             |
| Risk Percentage 2      | 80%             |
| Risk Percentage 3      | 95%             |

### One Number To Rule Them All

## Slide 11: Pre-packaging PMPM Guarantee with Stop Loss
### Stacked Bar Chart Data: Pre-packaging PMPM Guarantee with Stop Loss

| Category | Segment           | Traditional SL UW | PMPM G SL UW |
| :------- | :---------------- | :---------------- | :----------- |
| Total    |                   | $25,077,250       | $21,664,972  |
| Segment 1 | Expected M      | $13,861,800       | $13,861,800  |
| Segment 2 | Expected Rx     | $6,200,000        | $4,337,722   |
| Segment 3 | Corridor M      | $3,465,450        | $3,465,450   |
| Segment 4 | Corridor Rx     | $1,550,000 (calculated) | $0 (calculated) |

*Note: The fourth segment's value (Corridor Rx for Traditional SL UW and PMPM G SL UW) is derived by subtracting the sum of the other three explicitly labeled segments from the total bar height.*

## Slide 12: MavRx Workflow
*   **5 Minutes, not 5 weeks**
    *   **Audit the Incumbent**
        *   You upload the prospect's claims and pricing data—takes two minutes. MavRx spits out a full audit in seconds, showing where their current PBM's overcharging. Think hidden rebates or specialty drug markups.
    *   **Reprice the PBM Panel**
        *   We've got your PBM panel ready to go. MavRx reprices those same claims across the entire panel, so you see who delivers the best net cost—apples-to-apples, no fluff.
    *   **Obtain a PMPM Guarantee**
        *   From that reprice, we create a PMPM Guarantee for each PBM—a hard cap on pharmacy costs. Plus, our custom MedImpact contract (Optimal) doesn't even need claims history to underwrite, so you're covered for tough prospects.
    *   **Package w/ Stop Loss**
        *   You bundle those guarantees with your standard stop-loss submission and send them to our MGU panel. They see predictable Rx costs and can shave 15% or more off premiums or aggregate factors—cash back for your client.

## Slide 15: Competitive Landscape: WriteWise Stands Alone
### Procurement Platforms
*   Truveris and Ringmaster simply facilitate historical repricing – industry is fed up with this
*   Truveris and Ringmaster do not feature financial products or cost certainty
*   Inhibited business model focused on one-time RFP versus recurring fees

### PBM's
*   Do not have the ability to analyze groups for forward-looking Rx trend
*   Employers do not trust PBMs to adjudicate their own PMPM Guarantee

### Stop Loss Providers
*   Rely on global actuarial models. WriteWise has innovated with Rx-specific underwriting
*   Significant administrative costs (broker fees, carrier and reinsurance fees, etc.)

### WriteWise
*   Predictive Rx cost with products that provide certainty
*   Pre-integrated with 10+ PBMs on the panel (and growing)
*   Flexible product offerings across PMPM Guarantee, subscriptions, stop loss
*   Building a brand as the neutral "fiduciary" to keep PBM's in check
