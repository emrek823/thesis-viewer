### Team Background & Experience

- Rowland Pettit (CEO)
	- Physician scientist, former KDT venture fellow/associate, senior associate at Camber Capital
	- MD/PhD in computational statistical genetics/bioinformatics
	- Harvard National Brigham pathology resident, now researcher in Faisal Mahmood’s AI for health lab
	- Division I athlete at Duke, biophysics background
- Ming Yang Lu (Max)
	- Johns Hopkins undergrad: biomedical engineering + applied math/statistics
	- MIT CS PhD, specialized in digital pathology AI
	- Developed PathChat (generative AI for pathology) and early foundational models
	- Former Chief Science Officer at previous spinout (Mandela AI), now 90% committed to Aevius

### Core Problem & Technical Approach

- Clinical data reasoning gap
	- No way to synthesize across EHR, pathology images, radiology, labs, genomics
	- Data exists across multiple modalities, timepoints, and locations
	- Need semantic layer for multimodal, fully temporal clinical data
- Patient representation layer solution
	- Unified embeddings across all data types and time horizons
	- Text-aligned model enabling natural language queries at multiple abstraction levels
	- Real-time read access through Clarity data model integration
- MGB proof of concept
	- 7 million high-quality patients with full longitudinal records
	- Benchmarked on 100+ clinical/operational prediction tasks
	- Demonstrated utility for disease onset, treatment response, sepsis, readmission prediction

### Go-to-Market Strategy

- Seed stage deployment (18-24 months)
	- Expand to 2-3 additional academic medical centers beyond MGB
	- Free API access and lightweight UI for research/cohort building
	- White-glove deployment of multimodal search capabilities
- Revenue streams
	- Paid multimodal search upsells to hospitals
	- Biopharma pilots for real-world evidence, trial selection, rare disease identification
- Long-term vision: agentic orchestration for clinical care delivery after Series A

### Fundraising & Next Steps

- Raising $6M seed round
	- KDT already committed but flexible on lead/follow dynamics
	- Looking for 1-2 co-leads or single $4M lead
	- Focused approach with selected technical investors
- Technical differentiators
	- Text-aligned embeddings bridging health data and frontier reasoning models
	- Proprietary labels for 100+ outcome classifiers
	- Potential for multimodal biomarker discovery and FDA-calibrated predictions
- Integration opportunities
	- Interested in Integral Privacy Technologies partnership for HIPAA compliance
	- Working with Brad Malan’s team on federated deployment infrastructure
