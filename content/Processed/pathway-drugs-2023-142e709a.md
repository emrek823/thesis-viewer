## Slide 1: Title Slide

**Pathway Drugs**
Building pathways for safe access to
the most cost-effective prescription drugs

© 2023 Pathway Drugs. All rights reserved. Redistribution or public display not permitted without written permission from Pathway Drugs.

## Slide 2: Introduction

Pathway Drugs will be the first
**prescription drug importation platform**
**authorized by Health and Human Services,**
leveraging international market dynamics
and country-specific regulations to
**provide patients safe access to the most**
**cost-effective prescription drugs through**
**global parallel prescription drug trade**

## Slide 3: Executive summary

Executive summary

*   U.S. prescription drug spending and growth are unsustainable, **driven by brand name drugs that cost the U.S. ~$480 billion each year and have grown at a ~7% CAGR since 2017, outpacing CPI almost every year**
*   **U.S. brand name prescription drug prices are ~3-4x higher than comparable countries**, and over 50 million Americans cannot afford their prescription medications and leave them unfilled; **medication non-adherence costs the U.S. over $300 billion each year**
*   Due to high U.S. prescription drug prices, **2.3 million Americans buy lower-cost prescription drugs from international sources, and 78% of voters support** allowing Americans to buy prescription drugs from Canada, making drug importation one of the most bipartisan issues
*   The FDA's formal policies do not reflect (1) **the expansive opportunities for regulated prescription drug importation that already exist under Section 804 of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, nor (2) the Executive and Congressional support for importation programs**
*   The FDA's outdated formal policies also appear to ignore the fact that **brand name drugs from Canada or the E.U. are equally as safe, and that most brand name drugs are not in fact made in the U.S. (i.e. they are imported)**
*   **Brand name prescription drug importation is a multi-billion dollar market opportunity** that can help millions of Americans
*   Implementing Section 804 prescription drug importation opportunities will disrupt traditional supply-chain players, and as such, **no existing players are focused solely on Section 804 importation opportunities**
*   **Pathway Drugs is the first company focused solely on Section 804 prescription drug importation opportunities, and will facilitate both wholesale and personal prescription drug importation**
*   By importing brand name prescription drugs, **Pathway Drugs can save patients ~60-70% of the cost, but generate ~7x the unit economics of a traditional U.S. pharmacy**
*   **Pathway Drugs has a differentiated business model, and has a clear set of milestones** to seek authorization from Health and Human Services and to lay the foundation for a scalable business model
*   **The Pathways Drugs team has the requisite experience needed to build the first regulated prescription drug importation platform**

## Slide 4: Prescription drug spending and growth in the U.S. are unsustainable, driven largely by near-monopoly "brand name" drugs that benefit from patent protections and payer fragmentation

CAGR 2017-2021:
Unbranded generics: -3%
Branded generics: 2%
Brands: 7%

*   Total brand name drug spend reached over **$480B in 2021**
*   Brand name drug spend has grown **~7% CAGR since 2017**

**Average brand name drug price growth versus CPI**
Top 260 drugs most widely used by older Americans²

| Year | Brands (%) | General inflation (CPI-U) (%) |

| 2020 | 2.9        | ~1.4                          |

*   Brand name drug price growth **outpaces CPI every year**
*   Brand name drug price **grew double digits in some years**

## Slide 5: Brand name prescription drugs cost ~3.5x more in the United States compared to OECD nations, and tens of millions of Americans cannot afford and do not take their prescription drugs

**U.S. relative prescription drug prices**
U.S. costs versus comparable countries³,⁴

| Category                                   | Value |
| :----------------------------------------- | :---- |
| U.S. per capita prescription drug spend vs. comparable nations | 2.0x  |
| U.S. brand name drug originator prices vs. OECD | 3.4x  |

*   **Foreign drugs prices are ~60-80% cheaper for many drugs**

**U.S. medication insecurity**
All Americans⁵,⁶

| Category                                                           | Value |
| :----------------------------------------------------------------- | :---- |
| Number of prescriptions abandoned annually at the pharmacy (Millions) | 81    |
| Number of adults who cannot pay for prescribed medicines at least once in L12M (Millions) | 58    |

*   **Millions of Americans do not fill prescriptions due to cost**

**U.S. medication non-adherence costs**
Medical costs⁷

| Category                                  | Value ($B) |
| :---------------------------------------- | :--------- |
| Unnecessary medical expenditures resulting from medication non-adherence | 300        |
| Excess hospitalization costs alone resulting from medication non-adherence | 100        |

*   **Non-adherence is a major driver of preventable medical costs**

## Slide 6: Even though prescription drug importation is a lifeline of drug affordability for millions of Americans, and voters support importation, the FDA has not fully implemented prescription drug importation programs

**Number of Americans with a valid prescription who purchase prescriptions drugs from outside of the U.S.⁸**

**2.3 Million**

*   Millions of American import prescription drugs through an **unregulated market**

**Percent of voters in favor of allowing Americans to buy prescriptions imported from licensed Canadian pharmacies⁹**

**78 Percent**

*   Prescription drug importation is an issue with **bipartisan support**

**FDA's stance on personal prescription drug importation as found on FDA.gov¹⁰**

"In most circumstances, it is illegal for individuals to import drugs into the United States for personal use...

"...FDA, however, has a policy explaining that it typically does not object to personal imports of drugs that FDA has not approved under certain circumstances..."

*   The FDA lacks the infrastructure to effectively oversee drug importation

## Slide 7: However, Section 804 of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act provides a legal basis for prescription drug importation, and both Congress and the Executive branch support implementing importation programs...

**Section 804 authorizes wholesale prescription drug importation and provides broad authority to permit personal importation¹¹**

| PART      | SUBSECTION | DIRECTION GIVEN TO THE SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES BY CONGRESS THROUGH SECTION 804                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

**Recent bi-partisan legislative actions have reinforced the opportunities made possible under Section 804¹²⁻¹⁷**

**2020**
*   Trump issues executive order instructing HHS to facilitate Section 804 (j) waivers for importation, and complete the rule-making process for wholesale importation
*   HHS issues a final rule outlining a state wholesale importation program from Canada, and allows manufacturers to import drugs intended for foreign markets

**2021**
*   HHS issues "Request for Proposals for Insulin Reimportation and Personal Prescription Drug Importation"
*   Biden issues executive order directing the FDA to work to develop Section 804 (b) Importation Programs
*   Legislators in both the Senate and House introduce the Affordable and Safe Prescription Drug Importation Act

**2022**
*   The FDA issues guidance on the final rule published in October 2021, signaling their intent to engage with state programs
*   HHS withdraws their RFP, stating they have not received any proposals, but that they intend to consider alternatives

*   The cash-payer market is a clear opportunity as **cash payers pay ~2-3x the out-of-pocket cost that insured patients pay** for the same brand-name drugs, and cash payers are often more financially constrained

\*Note: 35% penetration rate is in line with insured plan target utilization rate for importation programs facilitated by non-authorized foreign companies. 70% penetration rate assumes higher penetration than insured plans because individuals do not benefit from rebates.

## Slide 10: Because prescription drug importation opportunities are new and evolving, and will disrupt traditional supply-chain players, no companies are solely focused on Section 804 importation opportunities

## Slide 11: Pathway Drugs is the first company focused solely on Section 804 opportunities, and will facilitate WHOLESALE prescription drug importation (1 of 2)

**WHOLESALE prescription drug importation**

**Pathway Drugs solution overview**
*   Pathway Drugs will operate a **wholesale prescription drug importation platform** that administers state wholesale importation programs
    *   Pathway Drugs will contract with Canadian wholesalers who are willing sell and ship prescription drugs to the U.S., manage importation to the U.S., **oversee quality testing and relabeling, and distribute to pharmacies and patients eligible under state programs**
    *   Pathway Drugs will **price the cost of imported drugs at a 17.5% markup** to the cost of the prescription drug plus supply chain costs

**Solution differentiation**
*   Vendors that will bid on state opportunities will be traditional wholesalers that are not exclusively focused on Section 804 opportunities
*   Pathway Drugs will be **differentiated relative to other vendors** that will bid on state importation programs in the following ways:
    *   Incorporation as a **public benefit corporation**
    *   **Direct-to-pharmacy and direct-to-patient** distribution models
    *   **Cost-plus transparent pricing model**
    *   **Payer contracting** so that imported drugs will be a covered benefit

**Legislative opportunity**
*   **Section 804 (b) of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the associated Final Rule issued in October 2020, authorize states to implement wholesale importation programs** as approved by the FDA

**Evidence of product-market fit**
*   **6 states (FL, CO, NM, NH, VT, ME) have passed legislation authorizing prescription drug importation**, with more states in process of passing legislation (e.g., CA, MA, IL, MI, MN, NJ, and others)²¹²²
*   Florida estimates their program, which is only focused on government payers (i.e. Medicaid), **will save the state ~$150M²³**
*   Colorado estimates their program, which is focused on commercial payers, **will save Coloradans ~63% on the cost of imported drugs, including a 45% markup for supply chain costs²⁴**
*   Florida and Colorado have selected vendors to administer their state importation programs
    *   The **Florida contract is worth ~$39M**, and is outsourced to a logistics company that is not focused on Section 804 opportunities²⁵

**Go-to-market approach**
*   Bid on state importation programs that have passed legislation but **that have not yet selected vendors** (NM, NH, VT, ME)
*   Cultivate relationships with states that have already selected vendors to **become a secondary importation vendor** (FL, CO)
*   Evaluate opportunities to open "importation only" pharmacies to take receipt from importation vendors and dispense directly to patients
*   Help other states pass legislation and craft their importation programs

## Slide 12: Pathway Drugs is the first company focused solely on Section 804 opportunities, and will facilitate PERSONAL prescription drug importation (2 of 2)

**PERSONAL prescription drug importation**

**Pathway Drugs solution overview**
*   Pathway Drugs will operate a **regulated personal prescription drug importation platform** that allows individuals to obtain safe and cost-effective prescription drugs from foreign sellers
    *   Pathway Drugs will **work with the FDA to authorize drugs for importation, facilitate waiver applications, authorize foreign sellers, and oversee dispensing practices** to ensure drugs dispensed are safe, authorized, and appropriately labelled
    *   Authorized foreign sellers will operate in a marketplace dynamic where they can set their own prices and receive patient reviews
    *   Pathway Drugs will charge a **17.5% markup** to the cost of the prescription drug plus supply chain costs

**Solution differentiation**
*   Current vendors that facilitate personal importation are not regulated, use antiquated technology, and in some cases do not have robust safety measures
*   Pathway Drugs will be **differentiated relative to other vendors** that facilitate personal prescription drug importation in the following ways:
    *   **Health and Human Services authorization**
    *   **U.S. ownership and incorporation as a public benefit corporation**
    *   **Direct integration into foreign sellers' systems**
    *   **Modern technology stack** that facilitates an excellent patient experience
    *   **Cost-plus transparent pricing model**
    *   **Payer contracting** so that imported drugs will be an eligible benefit

**Legislative opportunity**
*   **Section 804 (j) of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to permit personal prescription drug importation**, authorizes the Secretary to **grant waivers for importation**, and directs the Secretary to **establish an importation program from Canada**

**Evidence of product-market fit**
*   **2.3M Americans already import** prescription drugs through various unregulated channels
*   **Innovative payers and PBMs already leverage importation** as a way to reduce prescription drug costs
*   In the fall of 2020, the FDA issued a **request for proposal for a personal importation program²⁶**
*   Several unregulated companies (e.g. CanaRx, Care2Care, Global Rx Management) already facilitate importation for self-insured employer groups
    *   The **major players in this space are not owned and operated in the U.S.**
    *   CanaRx reportedly has ~500 private employers who leverage their services, with **~25% of members participating in prescription drug importation²⁷**

**Go-to-market approach**
*   Submit a **personal prescription drug importation platform proposal to the Secretary of Health and Human Services**
*   Propose a personal prescription drug importation **"innovation model" to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI)**
*   Once approved, open the platform to consumers and sell supporting products and services to self-insured employers

## Slide 13: By focusing on importing brand name prescription drugs, Pathway Drugs can save patients ~60-70% of the cost, but still generate nearly 7x the unit economics per prescription compared to a U.S. pharmacy

**Text Boxes:**
*   Brand name prescription drugs are the focus of importation programs
*   The cost of the foreign version of a brand name drug is ~30% of the cost of the U.S. version of the brand name drug
*   17.5% markup is in line with other transparent cost-plus pricing models
*   Despite the lower cost of the foreign drug, the net revenue is equivalent to the U.S. drug due to a higher markup percentage on the foreign drug
*   By focusing only on brand name drugs, the weighted average net revenue per prescription is ~2x for Pathway Drugs
*   Pathway Drugs will have lower clinical costs compared to a U.S. pharmacy because 3rd parties will dispense
