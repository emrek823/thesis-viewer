## Slide 2: The Opportunity

+ THE OPPORTUNITY

1
Half of EMS/911 transports are not emergencies.

Each avoidable ED visit is a $3,000 savings opportunity.

| Metric                        | Value     |
| :---------------------------- | :-------- |
| Average cost for avoidable ED visit | $3,400²   |
| Average cost for non-ED care (RightSite solution) | $400³     |
| Average savings for high quality, non-ED care | $3,000    |

[1] ClosedLoop.ai (www.closedloop.ai) analysis of Medicare claims data, 2019
[2] Based on non-emergency ER visits weighted average cost of discharge, observation stay and inpatient dispositions using 2019 Medicare data.
[3] $400 = $150 ER MD telehealth + $50 round trip transportation + $200 RightSite admin fee. RightSite gainshare fees not included.

## Slide 3: How RightSite Works

+ HOW RIGHTSITE WORKS

1.  Member calls 911 for non-emergency condition. Ambulance arrives.
2.  Medic determines non-emergency. Medic "zoom" calls RightSite. No patient behavior change.
3.  RightSite's ER physician and navigator deliver high quality in-home care. Plan and PCP notified. 24 hour follow up for SDOH and hand-offs.
4.  Win for Member. Win for EMS. Win for Plan.
