### Go-to-Market Strategy & Traction

- Diagnostics vertical
	- High volume, care about customer experience
	- Evvy case study helpful for positioning
	- Example: Barely doing ~1M shipments/month (wastewater testing)
	- Lower value per shipment but higher overall volume
- Health systems positioning
	- Value prop: Visibility around specialty pharmacy high-value shipments
	- Orwell as good example - coordination between stakeholders
	- White bag logistics coordination critical
	- Inbound/outbound visibility for patient/treatment center deliveries
- Big pharma approach
	- 7 of 20 big pharma companies in active funnel
	- Two key strategies:
		- Advisors open doors quickly (supply chain heads get 100+ cold outreaches daily)
		- Focus on commercial ops teams - revenue generating, move faster
	- Account mapping critical: understanding org structure, reporting lines
	- Novartis only one close to proposal stage currently

### Product Positioning Evolution

- Winning value props (in order of resonance)
	- Visibility + branded portal + control
	- Risk detection/prevention + customer experience
	- Loss reduction not resonating as initial sales driver despite being high-value long-term
- Market segmentation framework
	- High volume + high value = sweet spot (biotech, some pharma)
	- Diagnostics = high volume, lower value but good customer experience focus
	- Low volume + low value = not viable for software solution
- Partnership landscape
	- Clarium: inventory management partner, not competitive
		- They handle “tray running low, place order”
		- ZoomLogi picks up visibility after order placed
	- Meeting scheduled with Steve (got rescheduled)

### Hiring & Next Steps

- Sales hiring timeline
	- Health systems enterprise sales rep coming soon (dozen+ conversations ongoing)
	- Executive search firms engaged, commit to one by end of week
	- Timeline: 8 weeks to close C-level hire process
	- Budget: ~$100K for search firm (company running lean vs projections)
- Health system advisor gap identified
	- Have big pharma, diagnostics, cardinal/transfer advisors
	- Missing health system C-suite connections
	- Need credibility to break hierarchical structure
	- Multi-care CIO example of ideal profile
- Financial tracking
	- Still on track for 5 paying customers by end of year
	- Product delivery on schedule (October target)
	- Runway healthy, $400K+ current state

### Action Items

- Emre: Health system advisor introductions research
- Emre: Move flight to hang with Saad in Chicago tomorrow
- Saad: Landing 3pm, flexible meeting schedule around 5pm commitment
