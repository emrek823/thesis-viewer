### Macro Developments
There is a lot to be hopeful about as inflation inches down to the Fed's target of 2% and the market prices in six rate cuts in 2024, beginning in Q2. As consumer sentiment continues to positively grow, low unemployment and strong consumer spending have bolstered the economy. US onshoring continues to be a theme, riding on the coattails of domestic investment, while geopolitical and regulatory scrutiny threaten to hamper market conditions and the dealmaking environment.

### Deal Activity Recap
In 2023, PE deal activity declined significantly, marking it the worst year since 2017 due to costly debt markets stalling LBOs. However, dry powder grew to top $955B, which sits ready for deployment. Valuations slowly reset as bid-ask spreads narrowed, particularly in growth equity deals.

### Deal Activity Outlook
In 2024, we anticipate an increase in deal activity as PE firms respond to selling pressure from LPs. PE exit activity will likely skew later in the year as the economy stabilizes. Companies with refined profitability engines, decreasing borrowing costs, and ample PE dry powder are set to drive the next wave of deals.

### Healthcare M&A
Though not immune to the overall decline in deal activity, PE Healthcare specialist fundraising is on track to record their best year ever in terms of cumulative dollars closed, raising $17.6B through Q3 2023. The sector has seen significant benefits from an increasing number of specialized funds and investor interest, which has in turn expanded our sponsor coverage to over 200 firms.

### Healthcare Operating Environment
Despite the overall decline in healthcare deal values in 2023, biopharma M&A remained resilient. However, 2024 is likely to see a shift towards prioritizing internal R&D, with big pharma alone projected to invest $91B. While the funding environment for biopharma has improved, it favors later-stage pipelines. This trend is favorable for clinical service providers. However, pharma service providers that are heavily reliant on phase 1 and biotechs are expected to face sustained headwinds.

## Slide 6: Pharma Services Market Update

# Pharma Services Market Update

### Our Outlook
Pharma services has experienced an influx of investor interest. Bourne, which specializes in this category, has seen growing demand over the past decade. Many companies, particularly middle-market sized firms serving as outsourced service providers to pharma, often have customer concentration exceeding the general investment committee's 20% maximum. This is largely due to the sizable contracts and capacity demands of big pharma. However, the concentration risk is largely offset by sticky customer relationships and high switching costs, a result of stringent regulatory involvement and highly specialized supply chains. Consequently, thesis driven PE funds have shown increasing tolerance for this. We anticipate that outsourced pharma services will continue to see increased demand as healthcare specialists have turned away from PPM roll-up plays and value-based care models.

### Megatrends in Pharma Services

1.  **Greater Distribution and Patient-Centricity of Clinical Trials.** There has been a significant increase in focus on patient-centric approaches to clinical trials, ensuring better access to treatments and improved patient experiences, as the industry continues to face enrollment and retention shortfalls. Distribution networks are evolving to accommodate hybrid trials and reach diverse, historically underrepresented patient populations
2.  **Digitization, Data Aggregation, and AI Capabilities.** Advances in data analytics and aggregation allow for better data quality and insights into patient outcomes, real-world evidence, and drug safety. Pharma services providers are leveraging data to optimize clinical trial designs, enhance drug discovery, streamline manufacturing and supply chains, create commercialization and market access strategies, and inform decision-making processes across the entire pharma value chain
3.  **Manufacturing Capacity and Quality.** Capacity and quality are paramount to the industry. The past year has seen crippling drug shortages and quality issues. There is a glut of capacity in some areas, like CGT and OSD, while injectable fill/finish capacity remains scarce
4.  **Consolidation and Integration, or Specialization?** Pharma services providers face a delicate balance between integrating various services (such as CROs, CDMOs, and logistics providers) and maintaining specialized expertise. Finding the right mix of expansion and specialization is essential for efficient operations and successful outcomes as outsourced service providers adapt to meet the needs of drug sponsors

### Catalent
Catalent is one of the largest CDMOs with over 50 global sites and was the selected manufacturing, development, and supply partner for many of the successful COVID-19 vaccines. Following this success, the company completed 7 meaningful acquisitions, culminating in a $480 million buyout of Metrics, and raising $1,882M in debt. These acquisitions proved to be less accretive than initially anticipated and shortly after Catalent's COVID revenue reached a cliff. Catalent's Net Debt / EBITDA ratio at the beginning of FY2021 was 3.0x, and two years later, FY2023, was 6.8x. This was followed by a string of operational missteps, quality issues, executive changes, and downward earnings revisions, which erased all pandemic gains.

This attracted the attention of activist Elliott Investment Management, historically known for its success in technology, but recently showed interest in pharma outsourcing, partnering with Patient Square Capital and Veritas Capital to acquire CRO Syneos Health (SYNH) for $7.1 billion. Elliot initiated its Catalent position in July of 2023, and on August 29th, entered into a cooperation agreement with Catalent, introducing 4 new board members and a plan to overhaul the remaining seats.

# Catalent Case Study - The Buyout

**novo holdings**
Has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire
**Catalent**
and plans to sell
three sites to
**novo nordisk**

### Deal Overview
On Monday, February 5th, Novo Holdings and Catalent announced a merger agreement that will take one of the largest CDMOs private for $63.50 per share. This equates to an enterprise value of approximately $16.5B, which is equivalent to 19.5x CY24 consensus adjusted EBITDA, or 35.6x LTM EBITDA. This price represents a 16.5% premium to the prior trading day's closing price of $54.51 and a nearly 40% premium to the closing price of Catalent's common stock as of August 28, 2023, the last day of trading before the company conceded to Activist Elliot Management.

In conjunction with the announcement, Novo Holdings stated it will divest 3 fill-finish sites and related assets for $11B to Novo Nordisk, in which Novo Holdings has a controlling interest. These three facilities are located in Bloomington, Indiana; Brussels, Belgium; and Anagni, Italy and will be intended to support GLP-1 demand.

The transaction is expected to close toward the end of calendar 2024.

### VALUES

| Metric                  | Value     |
| :---------------------- | :-------- |
| Implied Enterprise Value | $16.5B    |
| LTM Revenue Multiple    | 4x        |
| LTM Adj. EBITDA Multiple | 35.6x     |

### Novo
Novo Holdings is the controlling owner of Novo Nordisk and manager of Novo's foundation assets. Novo Nordisk is a leading global provider of diabetes care products and manufacturer of Wegovy and Ozempic. The firm manufactures and markets a variety of insulins, injectable diabetes and obesity treatments, and oral antidiabetic agents.

In a rare reversal of asset-light and outsourcing pharma strategies, the acquisition of three sites serves to vertically integrate Nordisk's supply chain, as fill-finish capacity is necessary for the injectables business. This acquisition allows Novo Nordisk to fully commit to boosting the production capacity of their obesity and diabetes treatments. Novo Nordisk especially needed additional capacity for its GLP-1 treatments, which are currently in shortage in the U.S. with supply limitations being the major bottleneck preventing the unlocking of the obesity market. Of the three fill-finish sites, two already fill GLP-1s, Brussels and Bloomington.

## Slide 10: Catalent Case Study - Industry Impacts

# Catalent Case Study - Industry Impacts

### The Structure & Economics:
Catalent's Pharma and Consumer Health (PCH), Cell Gene Therapy (CGT), and drug substance businesses will remain with Novo Holdings. PCH was ~54% of Catalent's revenue in FY23 and Biologics made up ~46%. The Biologics segment is made up of fill-finish, (accounting for ~20% of total revenue), gene therapy (~17%), drug substance (6%), and cell therapy (4%).

The total purchase price values Catalent at 19.5x CY24 EBITDA, which represents a strong multiple despite the depressed EBITDA margins and several quality issues. The major value driver is Nordisk's $11B purchase for the 3 facilities. This is estimated to be 31x EBITDA (based on ~23% of revenue at a generous 35% EBITDA margin in those facilities). Thus, Novo Holdings is buying the remaining company (a mix of small molecule businesses and CGT manufacturing) for just ~11x EBITDA.

### Industry Impacts:

**Outsourcing Trends and M&A Valuations:**
We anticipate that this deal will not trigger a reversal of the decade-long outsourcing trend in the pharma industry. While the nature of the deal is an unlikely outcome for Catalent, the timing is not unexpected given the pressure from activist shareholder Elliott. However, an entire acquisition by an entity named 'Novo' was a surprise to many, especially after Danaher has previously shown interest. This transaction is emblematic of the current state of the pharma supply chain. Supply issues have impacted nearly all manufacturers, leading to record levels of shortages. Novo Nordisk has been one of the most afflicted by this, in that after launching its biggest blockbuster drug ever, Wegovy, it has wrestled with quality-driven supply constraints that led to 6-month shutdowns, halting production and slowing the launch.

This, coupled with the assumed ~31x valuation, represents drug sponsors' frustration with supply partners and the high demand for predictable, high-quality supply. As for Novo Holdings, this deal is not off strategy and the assumed ~11x EBITDA multiple is a steal for the once industry leader minus a few troublesome fill-finish sites.

**Existing Customers & Competition:**
Novo Nordisk will honor existing customer obligations at the current sites. However, customers may need to find alternative long-term suppliers as Nordisk intends to convert those sites to exclusively manufacture GLP-1s. Customers will likely be encouraged to migrate these contracts over to the primary sites operated by Novo Holdings.

The CDMO market is set to benefit from this development, as it will amplify demand for the already scarce sterile fill-finish capacity. Depending on supply agreements, Catalent / Novo Holdings may encounter challenges resigning these contracts, as switching costs are a key factor in maintaining long-term relationships in the outsourced pharma industry. This could likely create an influx of demand for competing CDMOs.

**Regulators:**
The acquisition still needs FTC and EU regulatory approval. Given the FTC's strict stance on recent M&A deals, this could be challenging. Eli Lilly, Novo's main competitor with the only other approved GLP-1, Zepbound, has called for regulatory scrutiny of the deal. Lilly relies on some of the three sites included in the deal to produce its diabetes and obesity treatments. Despite these potential competition concerns, GLP-1s are expected to contribute less than 3% to Catalent's 2024 revenue.

### Internal R&D – A 2024 Priority for Cash-Rich Big Pharma
As we enter a year characterized by ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty, the impact of drug price reforms, and an impending election, cash-rich pharmaceutical companies are expected to prioritize internal research and development investments. The increased R&D investment, driven by the pandemic, hasn't slowed down. In fact, pharmaceutical companies are still allocating a record percentage of sales towards R&D.

Big pharma alone is projected to deploy $91 billion on internal R&D in 2024, before increasing leverage positions. This surge is expected to be led by the reinvestment of profits from the success of obesity treatments. Companies like Novo, Lilly, and AstraZeneca are expecting to triple their R&D spending over the next decade as they redeploy their return on R&D investment.

Given the prevailing macroeconomic uncertainty, Federal Trade Commission (FTC) regulatory pressure, and the high cost of capital, it is likely that pharmaceutical companies will prioritize internal R&D over large transformative acquisitions to backfill pipelines.

# Contract Research Organizations ("CROs")

CROs are expected to see strong demand as clinical activity picks up. Big Pharma alone, a key customer and leading indicator, is projected to spend $91B on R&D in 2024. The biopharma funding environment is improving, with the end of 2023 witnessing increased VC funding and more receptive public markets—a trend that has continued into 2024. However, funding has been heavily skewed towards later-stage pipelines or plays on obesity and AI, leaving Phase 1/2 and earlier candidates still cash-strapped. For this reason, Phase 1 CROs and other providers primarily servicing Biotechs will continue to face headwinds.

### Key Trends
*   Site network and SMO consolidation remain a significant focus, anticipating increased M&A activity this year. Despite higher interest rates throughout 2023, which hindered extensive roll-up strategies, site networks continued to gain momentum. Now, with rates normalizing, investors are expected to further pursue this strategy in the coming year
*   CROs are increasingly investing in technology, particularly in core competencies like Clinical Trial Management Systems (CTMS). However, they face challenges with "true software applications" such as Electronic Data Capture (EDC), Randomization and Trial Supply Management (RTSM), or Electronic Clinical Outcome Assessment (eCOA). This space has seen a rush of new entrants and is ripe for consolidation. However, regulatory requirements vary across service offerings and prohibit the "co-mingling" of data, hindering vertical integration and a one-stop shop solution
*   The push for decentralized trials (DCT) has lost momentum post-Covid as clinical services companies struggle to provide the same level of quality care, patient engagement, and compliance quality control measures in a hybrid or decentralized setting instead of onsite

## Slide 18: Clinical Services - Trial Technologies

# Clinical Services - Trial Technologies

Clinical trials are currently undergoing a technological renaissance. Technology is transforming every aspect of the trial, from AI-powered drug discovery tools to patient recruiting, engagement, and management tools, trial management and randomization, and outcome assessment tools. Trials are now collecting more data than ever and often have several different portals that vary trial-by-trial and sponsor-to-sponsor. While greatly advanced, sites are often overwhelmed and experience "portal fatigue."

### Key Trends
*   Currently, clinical trial businesses are at the precipice of change in the industry brought on by the rapid improvements in data analytics, storage, and the emergence of efficiency-maximizing technologies and technology-enabled services
*   With the large sea of data that these companies collect, solutions that can process, clean, store, and provide insight on large amounts of data has never been more in demand
*   For example, for Phase I, the back-end data processing remains the largest opportunity to cut delivery timeframes down and reduce sponsor cost. Through automation, the industry standard of 90 - 120 days for data filling can be reduced significantly, saving costs on both the sponsor and vendor sides. Additionally, with the incorporation of RWE in orphan drug development, it is estimated that launches for market access could be brought forward as much as three years
*   As technology continues to have a significant impact on the clinical trial industry, we can expect to see leaps in efficiencies and cost-reductions, paving the way for more dollars to be put towards innovation

### Site and Sponsor Survey¹
*   **62%** of sites, sponsors, and CROs rate remote monitoring as extremely important
*   **59%** of sites view investing in technology as essential for being selected for a study

## Slide 19: Clinical Services - Patient Recruitment & Engagement

# Clinical Services - Patient Recruitment & Engagement

Patient recruitment involves clinical service providers collaborating with sponsors, CROs, and sites to attract and enroll patients in trials. Meanwhile, patient engagement companies focus on enhancing patient experiences and retention through various services, such as logistics support or interactive technology. Engaging patients in clinical trials is vital due to the high costs and time delays associated with patient recruitment. With an average dropout rate of ~35%, maintaining patient participation is key to achieving endpoints, gaining approval, and starting to recover R&D investment.

### Key Trends
*   Patient-centric approaches are being prioritized as sponsors, CROs, and sites navigate the path of better serving, engaging, and retaining patients
*   The market has been rewarding patient-centric approaches, which have quickly become a new investment thesis by sponsors and large strategic acquirers
*   The patient experience is increasingly valued in pharma, with 383 company filings citing "Patient Retention" or "Patient Engagement"
*   $6,500 is the average cost to recruit and enroll an individual into a trial, and the average dropout rate is 35% in late-stage trials
*   As therapeutics continue to target complex indications and pharma FDA regulations and study protocols become stringent around patient diversity requirements, diversity across patient populations to test a drug or treatment has never been more important or necessary

# Contract Development Manufacturing Org. ("CDMOs")

U.S. based manufacturing has gained significant attention due to recent drug shortages and supply chain complications, attracting government support. The U.S. gov. has pledged to back local supply chains with an investment of $1.4T over the next seven years for capital projects across critical industries. "Onshoring" has become widespread across all sectors, especially in pharma, elevating the importance of a self-reliant pharma supply chain to a matter of national security. CDMOs are poised to benefit from this trend, and established, high-quality U.S. manufacturing capacity will continue to command a premium.

### Key Trends
*   The CDMO market faces undersupply in areas like sterile fill-finish and highly potent API. Conversely, there is excess capacity in small molecule / generic API, oral drug, and cell and gene therapy (CGT). ADCs, GLP-1s, and other vaccines are driving demand for sterile injectables
*   Novo Nordisk's acquisition of 3 fill-finish sites will amplify demand for the already scarce sterile fill-finish capacity. Switching costs play a crucial role in maintaining long-term relationships in the outsourced pharma industry, potentially creating an influx of demand for competing CDMOs
*   As 170 products lose exclusivity within the next six years, many of which are biologics, the demand for sterile, injectable, lyophilized (lyo), and other advanced capabilities is expected to expand. Further, legislative action and pricing encourage pharma companies to pursue large molecule drugs (for more, see Bourne's [Pharma Sector Report](link_if_available))
*   Therapeutics are becoming more specialized and making advanced technologies and capabilities more desirable. Niche delivery systems such as intranasal, transdermal, and inhalation have seen increased interest
*   Pharma 4.0. CDMOs are leveraging tech-enablement to streamline workflows, operations, and expand margins

# Cold Chain: Biostorage & Logistics

The biopharma cold chain market encompasses packaging, transportation, and data services used to maintain the quality of pharmaceuticals, blood products, vaccines, and other biologics from the time of manufacture to the point of administration. It serves as a critical resource for biopharmaceutical companies and CDMOs facing storage and overflow challenges.

### Megatrends Influencing Biostorage & Logistics
*   **Global Demand for Sensitive Biopharmaceuticals:** Increased sensitivity of biopharmaceuticals and growing demand for specialized medicines is driving the need for tailored shipping and storage solutions. Specifically, the increased diabetic population globally and personalized gene therapy drugs
*   **Colder Cold Chain:** During the development of the COVID-19 vaccine, the pharmaceutical and cold chain sectors innovated, creating temperature-controlled packages and solutions to meet the needs of new deep-frozen COVID-19 vaccine storage. The success of the mRNA vaccines has unlocked future development within this class of drugs, many of which will require ultra-cold supply chain and storage
*   **Biosimilar & Complex Generics Demand:** As 170 products lose exclusivity within the next six years, there will be significant generic entrants, driving demand and expanding the needs for biopharma logistics and needs
*   **On-Shoring & Supply Chain Redundancy:** Global supply chain issues and national drug shortages are industry tailwinds. Companies are shifting away from just-in-time inventory and holding increased inventory levels

## Slide 24: Evolving Dynamics in Pharma Sales Channels

# Evolving Dynamics in Pharma Sales Channels

### Transformation in Pharma Channels
*   There has been a significant shift in the strategies and channels used by pharmaceutical manufacturers to bring their products to market. The traditional sales rep-to-physician model has become nearly obsolete in the post-COVID world.
*   This transformation has given way to Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) routes and Specialty Pharmacy networks, driven by ballooning gross-to-net spreads, discounts, and rebates.
*   However, mis-aligned incentives and extreme buyer concentration driven by the vertical integration of pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) and group purchasing organizations (GPOs), result in higher drug prices and place manufacturers under significant financial strain.
*   When considering discounts and rebates obtained by PBMs, many of which are owned by insurers, their actual contribution increases to approximately 64% of total prescription drug spending, with a notable portion being retained as profits rather than being passed on to plan beneficiaries.

### Issues Impacting Generic & Specialty Manufacturers
*   For 2022, brand-name drugs' net prices dropped for an unprecedented fifth consecutive year. What's more, after adjusting for overall inflation, brand-name drug net prices plunged by almost 9%.
    *   In the graph to the right, the difference between inflation-adjusted net price is 13.6%, the largest the spread has been since 2014.
    *   According to 46Brooklyn, the unweighted list price growth in 2023 remains around 5%.
*   Manufacturers are increasingly relying on innovative solutions to reach "inaccessible patients" and target smaller patient populations effectively. This emphasis on innovation underscores the industry's recognition of the need for tailored, highly targeted efforts to engage with patients and healthcare providers.

## Slide 25: Commercialization Services

# Commercialization Services

Pharma commercialization companies can add value in various ways, depending on their position in the value chain. However, the essence of their impact can be summarized by three key drivers: Volume, Price (Gross-to-Net), and Service.

### Volume

**New Scripts**
*   Patients and prescribers must be educated on the availability and efficiency of products
*   Transparency is the key to market access and affordability to patients. Companies like Prescryptive Health, GoodRx, discount cards, etc. are working to improve the current model
*   Transparent commercial agreements can eliminate formulary placement introducing a more competitive system

**Refills**
*   Patient engagement tech streamlines treatment and medication management, while boosting patient outreach and adherence

**Market Players (Volume)**
*   reverba
*   spencer health solutions
*   Tanner Pharma GROUP
*   prescryptive
*   GoodRx

### Price

**Gross-to-Net**
*   Pharma companies aim to reduce their gross-to-net spread, which is the difference between list price and net price after accounting for discounts to intermediaries like PBMs. This market is opaque by design
*   Innovators seek to improve transparency between patients, providers, and pharma companies to enhance affordability and patient care

**Cash Pay / Direct-to-Consumer**
*   Pharma companies are looking for ways to bypass intermediaries, opting for direct-to-consumer methods, transparent pricing and efficiency, and better alignment across patients, providers, and manufacturers

**Market Players (Price)**
*   IQVIA
*   IntegriChain
*   EVERSANA
*   TwoLabs AN ENVISION PHARMA COMPANY
*   ZS

### Service

**RWD**
*   Data provides insight to pharma companies and prescribers of the drugs, mostly through specialty pharmacy hubs
*   This data better informs doctors on how to best titrate their patients, increasing the quality of care
*   Pharma companies benefit from this due to better adherence rates and increased volume

**Payment Terms**
*   Pharma companies can find commercial partners (better payment terms, responsiveness, etc.) dealing outside of the traditional oligopolies (GPOs, PBMs, and wholesalers)

**Market Players (Service)**
*   veradigm.
*   Allucent
*   DEFINITIVE HEALTHCARE
*   ORACLE Health Sciences
*   SmithRx

## Slide 26: Medical Communications Services

# Medical Communications Services

Medical communications (MedComms) is vital in the pharmaceutical industry, disseminating essential drug information to both healthcare professionals and the public. It focuses on education and promotion, making complex scientific concepts accessible to non-medical individuals. As new drugs with specific indications enter the market, MedComms ensures that healthcare professionals understand their benefits and risks, supported by clinical and economic data. Effective communication contributes to an informed healthcare landscape, enhancing the impact of new treatments for consumers.

### Key Trends
*   M&A activity across the commercialization strategy, medical communications, and healthcare marketing space. Sponsor-backed businesses, in particular, have been highly acquisitive in late 2023 and early 2024
*   As Big Pharma targets smaller, more profitable patient populations, personalized treatments require an increase in advertising spend to reach these patient populations
*   Digital marketing utilizes platforms like social media and email to reach healthcare professionals and patients, and allows manufactures to gather necessary data for engagement and target market optimization
