CenCal Health (CCH) is a Non-Profit Community Based Health Care Organization contracted with the State of California to administer Medi-Cal benefits through local care providers in Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties. We provide health coverage for 1 in 4 people in Santa Barbara County, and 1 in 5 in San Luis Obispo County. We have been in operation since 1983 and are recognized nationally as the oldest Medicaid managed care program of its kind in the country. Our mission is to improve the health and well-being of the communities we serve by providing access to high-quality health services, along with education and outreach for our members.

### Opportunity Description
CenCal Health is in the market for a collaborative engagement with a vendor offering comprehensive services in Payment Integrity, including Fraud, Waste, and Abuse management. This partnership will be pivotal in the establishment of a solid Payment Integrity Program that integrates extensive Fraud, Waste, and Abuse prevention components.

Currently, CenCal Health provides coverage to approximately 228,679 members under its Medi-Cal program.

The selection will favor a vendor that not only aligns with but also amplifies our organizational values and mission, contributing significantly to our strategic vision. CenCal Health is eager to find a vendor, or multiple vendors, poised to support and achieve our key strategic goals in this space.
