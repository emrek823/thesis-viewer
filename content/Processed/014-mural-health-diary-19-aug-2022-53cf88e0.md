Company Build Diary

Started 7 May 2022 (while I was in Disney for vacation with Jennifer, Oliver, and Greyson)

By – Samuel Whitaker

Introduction – The overview of what has happened to date:

Greenphire was sold in July od 2021.  Leading up to that sale I was contacted by several private equity firms (Permira, Nordic, KKR, Advent…Im forgetting one or two).  Each of them wanted my help to diligence Greenphire…each of them wanted help with different aspects of their effort…but I think all of them were interested in validating the market size and thinking through the product strategy that would get the company from $1 Billion in value to a value sufficient to drive returns in the next exit.

My primary interface at Advent International was a guy named Jason Dong. He seemed like a nice guy, just as all the other contacts from the other PE firms seemed.  Over several month I had spent time talking with Jason through different issues.  I also talked him through my view on their product strategy.  If I were to get back involved with Greenphire I would focus my efforts on their ClinCard product and turn the functional point solution into a platform that was designed to make the patients’ lives better…I believed that a “patient management platform” could be category defining and lead the company to a 3x increase in value.

My hope was that one of the PE firms that I was becoming friendly with would win the process and end up owning Greenphire.  This would pave the way for me to return to the company in the form of a director on the board (this was my vision anyway).  But in the end Thoma Bravo bought the company…and I didn’t have any connectivity there.

After the sale had been completed, David Reuter introduced me, via email, to the partner at Thoma Bravo who had led the purchase of Greenphire, Hudson Smith.  Before making the introduction, David reached out to Hudson to ask if he wanted to connect…to avoid putting Hudson on the spot with a cold introduction.  Hudson responded to Reuter that YES!  He would like to meet me. David sent the email, and made the introduction.  I responded, offering to connect whenever it was convenient to Hudson….but no response.  Some time went by and I followed up…but no response.  The last follow up was a simple “good luck” email…where I simply wished him good luck with Greenphire.  Still no response. I thought to myself “this guy is such a dick head.” But then I decided that this was the true end of this journey.  And I would have to move on.  And I did…or I thought I had…

In the fall of 2021 Jason Dong reached back out to me…he wanted to talk about another company that Advent was interested in, Suvoda.  I just so happened to know, and admire, the founder/CEO, Jagath.  I connected with Jason and we talked about the company…one thing led to another and Jason told me that he was still excited about the product strategy I had laid out for Greenphire…he proposed that we build it ourselves.

At first I don’t think I was following what he was proposing.  Did he meand that he thought that Advent should build it through one of his companies?  Maybe he was thinking that it would be a good expansion opportunity for Suvoda (which it would be!)?  Over the course of several phone calls it became clear to me that Jason wanted to build the company as a start up…and he wanted me to do it with him.  I told him “no.”

I was flattered that he thought of me and wanted to build something with me.  But he also didn’t have any experience building companies…not that the lack of experienced mattered to me…he is a smart guy and seems hungry to succeed.  My issue was that he wasn’t aware of all of the pain and suffering that comes along with founding a successful tech company…in my experience, it isn’t fun.  There are definitely fun moments…but the last time I did this it felt like a long haul of continual agony…and it felt like the entire experience required years of therapy to heal the scars.

But Jason was excited and there was a part of me that wanted to get back involved in the “real world.”  There was also a part of me that wanted to write a story where I renter the “arena” and teach Hudson Smith a lesson for blowing me off…and maybe Hudson is simply a metaphor for all of the doubters…and other people who refused to acknowledge my role in bringing Greenphire from zero, literally just an idea in my mind, to a $1.1 Billion exit.

I told Jason that I would be an investor, advisor, board member…I would help him build the product…but I wasn’t going to be CEO.  That type of involvement seemed too frightening to me.  Too risky.  I was worried I would “relapse” and go back to the same place that I existed when I was the CEO of Greenphire….I had evolved from that place.  And I liked the life that I was living.

Jason agreed with that construct…and we started to collect the puzzle pieces and put them together.  The third founder of this new company would be Shawn Milochik.  Shawn is a software engineer.  He was the first developer at Greenphire and he mostly built Greenphire’s two primary products along side of me.  I designed the product and he made my design come to life.  He hadn’t made a big pay day with Greenphire and I liked the idea of giving him the opportunity to make a lot of money.  In a lot of way I wouldn’t be in the position I am in without having met Shawn.  Maybe this is a way for me to give back to him.

Kevin Onell as CEO

Rejection from the VC (the VC who rejected because I am in PR, Define rejecting because they didn’t think I would be involved enough)

The evolution to co-CEO and the willingness to do it again

This is a growth opportunity…I believe it can be done in a positive and sustainable way…lets see if I am right?

What about the risk of suffering?

Current fundraising environment – no downside for founders…so so weird

Week of

9 May 2022

This week we signed a term sheet with Bessemer Ventures.  They are leading a seed round.  They are going to invest $5mm and I am going to collect an additional $2.5mm.  They have valued the business at $20mm (pre money)…which is really insane.  We have not built anything, we have no customers, we have no revenue…at Greenphire our first money came in at a $900,000 pre money value.

Other investors are calling us.  Most of them are interesting and could help.  We met a persian guy who runs a group called Pear.vc…he knew nothing about clinical research and it was insanely annoying.  I hope they don’t call back.

We signed a contract to get our front end designed…and we are fighting through the process with stripe to validate that they can provide push to debit functionality…Shawn and I are trying to line up alternative fintech partners…I expect that we will be able to launch with Stripe but that the stripe solution is a work around that sales is putting in place…and eventually a stripe compliance person is going to shut us down.

Next week we present to the Bessemer partners on Monday and I also meet with Nat Turner…who I think would be exciting to get involved…his experience with Flatiron would help us when we build out future product strategy and if we expand outside of clinical technology.

Week of

16 May 2022

We seem to have locked in all of the investors who are going to make offers for this seed round.  We have about $13mm in demand (offers) and $7.5mm in space…this is a good place to be.  I will have to cut down allocations and maybe cut a couple investors out of the round.

I also sent my first weekly highlight email to the team at Bessemer.  The plan is to give them a series of highlights each week so that they are engaged…and I also want to keep them prepared in the event that anyone ever asks them about our progress

This week the world also started talking about the economy in a way that seems pretty dark.  The general sentiment is that we are entering a downturn / recession. There was a great recorded conference call from Craft Ventures that Steve Kraus shared with me….explaining why public company and venture market valuations have plummeted

Weekly bullets:

Engaged Laura Remaker to help on a contract basis with recruiting and some HR setup.  She was the HR person at Greenphire and I worked with her before GP too

Initial meeting with Joanna Keating who is going to help us construct a marketing plan for our launch and help with execution (also on a contract basis).  I have worked with her in the past and she is coming from Vault health…she may be a good FTE at some point

Reached out to a marketing agency that can help us throughout (Sage Frog) they work with a couple of tech companies in clinical trials and I know them from GP and Signant.  Need to figure out pricing and their availability

Interviewing product people...met a bunch this week. So far I am favoring Mahesh Murali (referred by Joanna Keating and Zach Weinberg also endorsed him as he worked at Flatiron)

The guys from Virtue have been very engaged this week and seem to be doing some work on our behalf both a) figuring out how to crack the CRO sales channel and b) recruiting/stealing good sales people from other clinical tech businesses.  To be honest, they seem more engaged in this way than any investor I have ever encountered…fingers crossed that it continues post-close and that their efforts are fruitful…it would be very helpful.

Met with Maggie Adamski from TrialBee this week…trial bee is a patent recruitment company…there is a tech story on the surface but it is likely an agency like most of the others.  38 employees, 6mm revenue, 10 years into their journey.  Maggie was very excited about the idea of leveraging the patient payment to develop a deep patient engagement experience.  I also pitched her the concept of using payment tech in the patient recruitment process…if you think of patient recruitment as a sales funnel (randomization being the bottom) there is a lot of drop out between pre-qualification and a first office visit (FOV) - we can use our application to increase the conversion to the FOV stage via incentive payment and Uber functionality.  Maggie was excited.  Maggie is also going to connect me with patient advocacy groups so we can connect with patient stakeholders in the development of the front end.

Legal is in progress for the seed round

Nothing negative to report...FIS is moving at a snail's pace...but they are moving so thats kinda positive.

Week of May 23rd:

Nothing especially interesting happened this week.  But below are my weekly update notes to the team at Bessemer:

Continued making progress with recruiting Mahesh Murali on product role.  I had a second conversation with him this week digging deeper into product strategy and competition (and expected product-driven competitive advantages).  Next step is for him to meet Shawn (scheduled for today (27 May)).

Met with Evolve Bank & Trust this week.  They said that they have a good relationship with Bessemer (Charles Birnbaum).  Seems like they will have quite a few useful options for our platform.  Im also interested in exploring how they will be able to help us distance ourselves from the funds flows which will be helpful for eliminating any question about the business being a money transmitter (there are multiple solutions for this btw).

Also met with Cross River - these guys seem pretty similar to Evolve.  I especially liked their capabilities for managing issuance dollars…we could effectively separate study funds in their own FBO accounts where Greenphire “co-mingles” funds.  Operationally this allows for cleaner reconciliation…and there will be finance stakeholders at the sponsor level who will prefer individual accounts.  There is more investigation needed for both Evolve and Crossover but we are definitely driving into a more innovative FinTech space compared to GP and their competitors. Go us!

First weekly meeting with New Deal Design.  Set them up to connect with Brad Hightower so they could get site feedback on their branding exercise...they did that interview yesterday.  Going to connect them with a few others.  So far so good.

Reached out to a group of 4 oncology sites in Puerto Rico (intro made by my neighbor)…lets see if we can turn that into an early customer.

Legal docs for the fundraise should be drafted and sent to BVP counsel next week.  I have a draft of allocations and back up investors (people being held in reserve to fill gaps as needed).  I will start communicating allocations over the weekend or early next week.

Jason received a commitment from Michael Miltenberger and Lauren Young both of which could be helpful in navigating the large CRO space. Particularly with Syneos.

Scheduled lunches with Rick Ward and Bill Digiacobbe for when I am back in Philadelphia (June 4 - Aug 6)…both will be used to start thinking about sales hires.  Both of these guys are good player/coaches…and both had success at Greenphire.  Bill has a 24 month non-compete that is about a year completed.  Rick works for CluePoints and Im not thinking of him as a recruit but more of a channel to refer other sales people.

Met with SageFrog to get them on board to help us with marketing.  Kristen Everett is going to come back to me in about a week with feedback.  She seemed excited from a PR perspective about the story.

We continue to make progress on the backend API. We have a first pass on most of the API functionality on the roadmap. We are now we developing a "simple reference app" (think of this as an ugly front end to test the API...) you can see a screenshot below taken during our weekly team meeting from this morning.

Met with Correlation Ventures this week, who are excited to put some capital to work. They pitched us on ways that they could support us - they have several biotechs in their portfolios, and several are working with CROs...they claim we can leverage those relationship. Wesley Barrow additionally is a GTM "expert" who can help possibly help us develop a system to onboard salespeople quickly. TBD exact allocation for them (if any...right now I have them in the bucket of being held in reserve to fill gaps.

Below is the picture that I attached:

3 June 2022

This week wasnt my favorite.  But I guess they all cant be great.  If you were wondering if I was only going to send through sunshine and puppy dogs...well, now you know.

It was a short week on account of Memorial Day, which seems to have made everyone a little lazier this week...maybe I shouldnt have had high hopes for the week after a holiday weekend

1) Shawn: Shawn didnt bother to file his complete his section 83b election...Geoff Schwartz connected with Josh from Cooley and they are going figure out an option that works. Stay tuned on this front. Note to all - send in your piece of paper to the IRS on time to avoid causing someone else headaches!

2) SageFrog: The marketing agency that I wanted to work with turned us away this week.  They claim that they are struggling to staff current clients and cant take on another early stage business...I was surprised to hear this and I was expecting them to work with us because they have worked with me before...so onto the next one.  Kristin from Sage Frog is going to send me a few other options. The first one she sent to me is Greenphire's agency...so that one doesnt count.

3) New Deal Design: We had a pretty productive branding meeting with NDD this week.  And then today we had another meeting focused on product design that I was pretty unhappy with and felt like NDD was missing the mark (this is the polite description)...I talked to our main point of contact after the meeting and she assured me that the process is tracking as normal...she claimed I had to "take a trust fall" so lets see what happens next week.

4) Mahesh (my favored product candidate): I caught up with Mahesh this morning to find out where his head was on this opportunity.  He was undecided and said he needed more time to think it through.  He told me he would reach out in a month's time to touch base.  And also made it clear that he would reach out and I shouldnt proactively follow up.  He was very nice but what I heard was "not interested, you wont hear from me again" so lets move on...talking to another (more junior candidate) named Hugh Phelan on Wednesday.  He is very eager, and smart...but less experienced.

5) Recruiting Win (finally something good): Laura Remaker (contract recruiter and ex GP HR person) connected with Courtney Valeo this week...Courtney is one of two people at Greenphire that I would like to have work with us.  Laura was sent on a covert mission to take Courtney's temp...and see if she was open to leaving.  One thing led to another and Courtney indicated that she would be really interested to come and work with me again...so I will meet with her on Monday night and see if I can get her on board...if she wants to do this then I will need to have a legal analysis done in order to understand our options for navigating her non compete.  So not a closed win here but it was great news to my ears...lets see what happens.

Week of June 10, 2022

Hi All,

Ok this was a better week than last.  Good news.  Today is my birthday…super old.  42. Hopefully I will live to see the end of this build process.  If not, you guys will have to swing by the nursing home let me know what happens.

Shawn’s 83b Issue: We were able to figure out a solution to the 83b by providing Shawn options rather than stock. He will lose out on some economics but he is ok with it, so we should be all good to go on the original closing timeline. Thank you guys for working through this with us!

Fundraise: We are waiting on comments from your legal.  Last I heard, we should get comments back tonight.  Hopefully we are close and we can wrap this up in short order.

Jagath W / Suvoda: I talked with Jagath today (founder of Suvoda) who I am friends with.  He would like to invest in this round.  The lead investor from LLR (Howard Ross) would also like to invest in this round…Howard is waiting on Jagath to give him a thumbs up.  Jagath wants to socialize it with his cofounder (Rob Hummel) to make sure Rob is comfortable with it…I will know in a week or 10 days.  Suvoda will also be a very useful integration point for us (their new eCOA solution and our payment tech).  Suvoda is also a logical acquirer of ours…and we have a very friendly relationship with their senior team.  Lets see what happens.

New Deal Design: As a reminder, the NDD work splits between i) branding (which we’ve been very happy about) and ii) product design (which we were less thrilled). This week, we were able to dig more substantially into the product design work, and I think we were back on track. They are starting to map out functionalities needed in the phone app + patient journey through a trial

Product hire: Hugh Phelan came to my house this week to catch-up. He was good - smart guy, mid-level, very eager to join us and seems to be smart.  He is "pretty good" but not "amazing" in my view. He also has extensive summer travel plans (not ideal), so we’ll see when it makes sense to bring him on full time. Jason is speaking to one other candidate called EmmaEikermann later today who also falls in the camp of smart, hardworking, early career PM and we will make a decision. Still TBD whether we need a person at all, but looks like we will at least have a safe option in Hugh.  Alternatively, we may keep the early product work to Jason and Sam until we have someone cross our path that really impresses us.

Operations hire: Courtney Valeo came back to us this week and expressed a lot of interest to move forward with the potential operations role. Next step here is to move forward with conducting a legal analysis to see how we can navigate the non-compete issue that will exist (if at all). I sent her docs off to the lawyer that we connected with via your referral.  This hire is still early but getting her on board would be a big pick up for us.  Stay tuned.

MVP: still chugging along. We are mostly done with our reference app (a quick and dirty frontend app for us to test the backend functionality), after which we will use it to do extensive testing of the backend. Plan is to complete this testing, make changes and wrap up the rest of the backend by ~July. The real frontend app won’t be developed until NDD’s design work starts to be finalized. Their work on flow of screens will come out around mid-July, and final visual designs around mid-August. Our plan mid-July is to i) bring onboard a React web app frontend dev and ii) outsource the mobile app to a Flutter dev. They will implement the designs coming out of NDD, and we hope to wrap up the coding by mid-September

Week of 17 June 2022

Hi All,

I was hit with the flu last saturday...spent a few days in bed...it was brutal. But Im a Xennial and we are rock hard MFers....so progress continued:

Funding close: We are finishing final iterations on the legal terms. Should be wrapping up funding early next week. I just sent final principal documents to the 12-13 other investors confirmed for this round to start wrapping up the process.

Product hire: All of us spoke to Emma Eikermann this week (I spoke to her 3x) - we’ve all really enjoyed her. She is earlier in her career, but is smart, a great fit in terms of culture, has acted as a product person for many early patient facing health tech apps in her current role as in an outsourced health tech product build shop and knows the eClinical space well, even using Greenphire as a CRA. We are sleeping on it as a team about whether we want to extend an offer, but overall very excited about possibility of hiring Emma and she is best alternative so far

Operations hire: We conducted legal analysis on the situation with Courtney Valeo this week. WIthout a doubt there will be an emotional reaction by Greenphire when they find out that she has come to work with me on this company.  But we dont perceive this to be a risk that cant be managed for the following reasons i) is a great employee but she’s not very senior ii) it can be argued that she’s coming to Ginku because we’re providing her outsized jump in her career iii) she’s right now working in investigator payments at Greephire, so the move will be less directly competitive/transferrable to Ginku (i.e. - she wont be bringing any proprietary data/knowledge that would be relevant to our product) and iv) and we believe ultimately courts are unlikely to leave Courtney without a job. One comp is Ryan Kelly, who left Greenphire to join Auxilius as a VP of product 9 months ago (more senior to Courtney, though Auxilius is less directly competitive with GP) and that move has resulted in some legal correspondence but nothing more substantial. Some work will still need to be completed...but I'm optimistic

Sales Hires: I spoke to a sales recruiter today (Jon Gardow) who used to be a bag carrier at Greenphire. He works on contingency and he specializes in sales hires in clinical technology.  Jon has a very good understanding of the type of sales person I am looking for.  He heads off to the DIA conference on Sunday and will start to present me candidates as he crosses paths with viable options.  I am starting to look for sales people now...it will take some time to find the first few.

LinkedIn data scraping: we are engaged with a marketing contractor from LA named Jesse Shapiro.  Jesse is leading an effort to scrape profesional information including email addresses for clinical operations, study teams, and related professionals that are associated with the list of ~140 sponsors that I sent his way this week.  We are expecting this effort to result in approximately 20,000 records and will be the start of our outreach database...and will seed our salesforce database when we get to that point in our pre-launch work. If you all know of any special data mining resources to assist in this effort please let me know.

MVP: Done with reference app - Shawn demoed it this week. Jason and I will go through a period of extensive testing to make sure we are happy with all the edge cases. Next week focus is on building on the Stripe implementation (Paypal and check implementations already done)

Have an awesome weekend!

-Sam

Week of 24 June 2022

Hi Team,

Closing and Cash: Seed round closed on 23 June.  Noted.  No party. Heads down. Let's build. I have received a hair under $7mm and I am waiting on and additional $250k that should be in house over the next day or two.  The remaining $250k will get figured out before the end of August.

Reg D Filing: Geoff is going to file the Reg D filing providing the minimal information to stay quiet.  No announcements etc will go out before launch.

Suvoda: Howard Ross and Jagath pulled out of our seed round at the last minute. Howard decided that it was a conflict of interest for Jagath (founder of Suvoda) and him to participate.  This signals that Suvoda is likely planning to try and build a patient payments solution (I dont expect this to be a short term product initiative for them).  Suvoda recently hires the Greenphire product person who was responsible for the ClinCard product (Zach). Zach is now working on Suvoda's eConsent...but surely Suvoda is going to use him at some point to help inform the patient payments product.  I heard that Jim Murphy was tipped off about Zach and Suvoda this week while he was at the DIA conference...reports are that Jim Murphy was furious and explained that Suvoda had signed an agreement agreeing that Zach would not work on a patient payments product...drama!  Maybe GP and Suvoda will duke it out while we build in the back ground.

New Deal Design: Had a call with Kelly F from Y Prime who runs their patient insights team...she can give us access to the patient perspective to influence our product design. She is now coordinating with NDD to help inform their product work. We also received some name suggestions from NDD this week...none are amazing...Jason and I are working on alternatives and will hopefully land on something over the next few days.  I am accepting ideas if you have any. there are no bad suggestions :-) you can use brandbucket.com to help stimulate your creativity.  NDD also presented some initial front end structures for both the mobile application and the web application.  I liked 2/3rds of the options and I feel good about where we are on that front.

Product Hire: We sent an offer letter to Emma Eikermann this Tuesday and are expecting to hear back sometime today. Answered some of her questions and hopefully it’s a positive response. Hoping for an end of July start. I think she may also be considering a role with Curebase. Fingers crossed!

VP of Ops: After doing our legal analysis, we feel good about having Courtney come on board. It is not risk free but I feel confident that we are able to manage the hire successfully. We have drafted an offer, and we have one final legal call to complete before we can finalize the hire. 10 days eta.

Sales Recruiting: I had lunch today with my preferred sales leader.  He is interested in the opportunity.  We will continue this conversation but it will be a longer term effort to get him in house.  Remind me to fill you in on this next time we chat. I have another sales person being warmed up by a recruiter...Paul Diercksen from Endpoint...I dont know him but his profile looks like it could be good.  This is unremarkable at the moment but I am happy to start seeing candidates surface...my recruiting snowball has begun to roll.

Banking: We reached out to SVB and UBS to see what they can offer us on the banking front.  We are going to upgrade over out vanilla checking account in order to maximize interest income on our cash and access some additional banking functionality. Waiting on both to present options. If you have any suggestions on this front let us know.

Week ending July 1, 2022

Happy Friday!

This week my wife and I announced the baby to our broader friends and family.  This was a fun picture and Im passing it along...because who doesnt like to see two smiling kids with a pink onesie?

Backend systems: We stood up a couple of back office systems this week including:

Carta: we are onboarding smoothly and looking to finish in next 1-2 weeks, and then generate a 409a a week after that, so that we can start issuing options.

Banking: we started onboarding with UBS. We’ll split cash between a money markets account which is producing ~1.4% and an ultrashort term bonds portfolio, which is ~3%. It’ll require a little bit of foresight to manage the ultrashort term bonds portfolio, but altogether this will produce $170K+ a year of cash. UBS will also give us all of the typical features you’d expect (credit cards, remote deposit, wire transfers etc) without additional expense.

Melio payments: onboarded to pay all vendors by ACH for free.

Health insurance: we have selected an affordable BCBS Silver PPO plan, which was important across our small employee base but especially important for our new product hire (Emma Eikermann) who has Type 1 Diabetes…which happens to be the source of her passion for clinical trials…she has been in clinical trials for type 1 diabetes since she was 3! The health insurance is slightly cheaper than we modeled in our operating model, which is nice. Looking to roll out that our effective for Sept 1.

VP of Operations: Sent out the offer to CourtneyValeo this week and had a few more legal calls with her. She will get back to us after the weekend. Looking at a potential September start if it works out.

Naming: We have iterated on this a million times at this point, and are zeroing in on Mural Health. Trials are not data, but the diverse mural of patient whose lives and experiences produce that data. We are doing a legal analysis to see if we are clear to move forward with Mural Health (see below on Trademark for detail).  The .com is available and can likely be purchased for $10k-$12k (it has a buy now price of $15k).

Trademark: Going to do a search on Mural Health and if it is ok we will file an intent-to-use trademark.  Total cost will be about $5,500 between the search and the trademark filing which including any back and forth that might happen when the examiner comes back…should have the results of the initial knock out search (should cover 80% of the territory that needs to be searched) in the next few days and the results of the more in-depth search should yield us a conclusion by the end of next week.

Simon Burns Wire: Simon Burns ($5,000) is the only wire that hasn’t come in.  I have followed up with him a few times without resolution.  He says it was sent but it seems likely that there was an error on his side.  Will continue to follow up

Monthly / Quarterly Calls: Seems that we have arranged calls (2nd Thursday of the month with 4 being “board meetings”) thanks to Lauren Coughlin.

Sales Recruiting: I met with Steve Herne today (Chief Commercial Officer of WCG)…he is going to send me 2 people who could be good sales people.  I also have a call scheduled for next week with Paul Dierksen of Endpoint.

New Deal Design: Nothing special with NDD this week…just forward progress on GUI design and branding.

Next Week: I will be on “vacation” next week.  That wont change a whole lot…although I will attempt to go a little lighter…but will still be available if needed and still doing calls etc.

Week Ending 8 July 2022

Pre-Launch / Pre-Revenue

Hi All,

The most fun update is that we are now Mural Health and we own the muralhealth.com domain (which we negotiated it down to $10k from the buy-now price of $15k). The trademark attorney backpedaled when I dug in on the differences between company names and product names.  As long as we dont name the product "mural ___" then we are safe relative to the GE product...so clearance was granted.

A few items that pop to mind from this week:

Courtney Valeo: This is highly confidential but Courtney accepted our offer yesterday and we are thrilled about that. She’s coming on September 7th. She ultimately got comfortable with legal risk and is excited about leading operations and helping me to build the setup manager application so that internal implementation is as smooth as possible...and we can then externalize setup to the CROs. The team is starting to come together…product, engineering, and operations are seeded. Next up, sales.

Sales Recruiting: I met with Paul Diercksen this week, who is a player/coach candidate and it was positive. I did a reference call on his this morning with a guy in Europe that worked with him at endpoint for several years...the feedback was very positive and I found that to be encouraging.  Next call will be Tuesday when I will dig in a bit to understand how he would manage sales and if it aligns with how I want the team to run. We have also started sourcing a broader pipeline online and through a few personal contacts.

New Deal Design: Finished of Phase 1 out of 3 Phases with NDD. They have the flow of the web and phone app architectures down. Next 2 phases will be mostly heads down time. Phase 2 will be them building out the wireframes for phone/web apps and website, and Phase 3 will be adding visual design.

Web engineer onboarding: Nancy Tang is onboarding as a contractor at the ~beginning / mid-August, once the NDD design work is in a good place for her to code.

Phone app engineer search: The Flutter engineer we were working with took up another project, so we are looking for a replacement, ideally a contractor but we are also open to full time. Let us know if you happen to know a source for such a person and we are happy to shoot over a short blurb

Wire: Simon Burns’ wire finally came in this week, rounding out the last part of the round. Some of Jason’s angels still to come in during August

Healthcare: Health and dental plans have been secured at ~$2.2K a month vs. the $2.6K that we modeled, so we are pretty pleased.  Employees will also pay a portion (Employees will pay 20% for the employee and 50% for family members). This will roll out starting September 1.

Lob HIPAA compliant solution: Lob is our provider of the check issuing/mailing solution. They have a HIPAA compliant solution (e.g. encryption, HIPAA compliant printing, sensitive data protection) that we are going to move forward with - it’s going to be a great marketing point against Greenphire i.e. “even our check solutions are HIPAA compliant.” We negotiated from $10K down to $5K...they asked us to help them do a case study on us in exchange for the pricing concession...fine by us. All publicity is good publicity!

In other news - I met Emre today from Virtue...he happened to be in southern New Jersey.

Hello All,

On a personal note, my wife, Jennifer, went to a night club with her cousins while we were on vacation in Stone Harbor.  The universe punished her (should Old Ladies be out partying with 20 somethings?!) with Covid.  We managed to get her a dose of monoclonal antibodies (Sotrovimab) the day after she tested positive...and I got a dose along with my oldest son (our second dose this far). No sweat.  Everyone is fine...and Jennifer is 95%.  None of the rest had any symptoms.

Jessica Kleiman: Carolina Kung introduced me to Jessica Kleiman (new advisor working with BVP) and I (along with Joanna Keating) connected with her this week to talk about our developing launch plan.  Jessica was great...and a few things fell out of the conversation.  Jessica reinforced Joanna's instinct to try and use a high profile conference as a jump off point.  I was reintroduced (via Craig Lipset) to Amir Kalali - and I will see if Amir will help us use the CNS Summit in November to do an official launch.  The CNS Summit has evolved into a sort of "whos who" type of event...I just cringed after writing that.  The second thing that fell out of the conversation was an introduction to David Luu who is the founder of a company in the longevity space called Hearty - There may be some relevance to what he is building to our application but the intro is really just driven by my personal interest in longevity science and fitness/wellness (I have an outspoken goal of living an active/healthy life through 100 birthdays). As I mentioned to David in my email to him, I am an investor in Levels Health, early adopter of Nutrisense (I was living in Puerto Rico and Levels couldnt work with me there), I almost invested last December in Sergey Young's Longevity Vision Fund but I pulled back at the last minute...and recently was introduced to Peter Attia (very unintentionally) by a friend whose wife is a product manager for Galleri) - if you are interested to see the details on Peter Attia's medical practice I am attaching it...if you want to join it...get ready to write a big check.

Front End Dev: As we reflected on finding a mobile Flutter dev, we thought about whether we were truly anchored to Flutter. A few months ago it was important to us, because we wanted to build both mobile and web app on Flutter, but given that our web app is being built in React as a separate app from mobile, we are no longer anchored to Flutter. As a result, we are broadening our search for other outsourced dev shops that can do any sort of front end app dev, preferably in React Native (one of the most popular and well-supported frameworks, used by FB, Snap, Instagram, Coinbase) in lower cost geos. We are speaking to Venture Dev and Oaks Lab. If you have any suggestions here, let us know!

Paul Diercksen: I had a second meeting with Paul this week and Jason met him today - he is getting to be pretty pumped about working with us and we really like him.  We are mostly aligned on approach to managing sales and the gaps are pretty nominal. He is strategic, data driven and has potential to lead the sales org…but he is also happy to be in a “player/coach” role, which I believe is critical at this stage.  I have checked up on him behind the scenes and the feedback I have gotten is overwhelmingly positive. He might also bring over another sales person from Endpoint, which would be great. Potentially a good fit...stay tuned

Partnership with LedgerRun: We have had a “partnership” with LedgerRun (early stage competitor to Greenphire started by some old CFS guys focusing on site (investigator) payments). I help answer questions about site payments and, in return, they will hopefully include us where it is helpful to them to have a patient payment offering.  This week, Gary (CEO) sent me two opportunities with a CRO I’ve never heard of called ProPharma. One study starts at the end of October and the second in Feb. We sent a few slides of our capabilities (product comparison between Mural and GP and other competitors).  This is a long shot but I would be happy to get a first win through a channel and with a small CRO…fingers crossed.

Ed Seguine: I talked with Ed Seguine this week (founder and CEO of Clinical Ink). He reached out to me via email and said

"I’ve been surprised at the lack of alternatives in this space particularly with a shift to more remote/hybrid studies that necessarily require different payment mechanics for patients.  We’ve been exploring possible approaches to “build”, “embed”, or “partner” on payments but I don’t feel like I, personally, have enough context to effectively evaluate options."

I told him what we are up to and I also told him Id be happy to integrate into his site-facing front end and structure an economic opportunity for ClinicalInk.  He was very interested in this...his timing is Q1 to make resources available for this integration. This conversation also led me to reach out to Roman Margolin and I chatted with him on Thursday about investing some of his $ into the seed round...he has never invested in a pre-revenue business...he is going to think about it and get back to me (small check think $10k - $30k most likely)

Carta & 409a: Is now live and we have gotten a 409a valuation that we are good with at $0.27 a share which will serve as the strike price for options. If you are wondering the implied valuation at that strike price - its about $4.1 million. We are now good to go in issuing options, which we’ll do for Shawn and Emma Eikerman, and Courtney will be coming up in September.  We will be issuing options as a % of outstanding shares (vs a fully diluted basis) and I am using a 5 year vesting schedule vs a 4 year (1 year cliff and 1/48th monthly for the next 4 years)

UBS: Funds are now in - we’re leaving ~$1M in the cash account and the rest in the higher interest account at ~3.3% and we will reassess cash management as we go

Quickbooks: Now live and we’re now going through the nitty gritty of building financial statements in it. Coming along nicely and we are internally reviewing IS and CFS

Evolve Bank & Trust: Submitted diligence info for Evolve…this will likely be a second version of the payments back end to cut out Stripe and get more robust features on the management of issuance funding (client dollars).

Product Naming: We are honing in on a product name for the MVP and a naming convention for future products / modules / consumables.  I think Mural Link or Mural Health Link are in the lead.

Hi Team!

I hope you all enjoyed the week.

CNS Summit - over the last few weeks, I’ve been meeting with organizers from the CNS Summit this November to try to land us a spot for our company launch. As you guys may know, the CNS summit is expanding beyond just CNS and is a great platform for the whose who of clinical trials. I had a great conversation this morning with the organizers and they are excited for us to go - they love the story of potentially one of the biggest clinical tech rivalries being born at their conference. I am meeting with them again next week. Coincidentally, this is also how Medable launched - hopefully we will market ourselves just as well as Medable has, but with a product to go with the marketing.

Mobile app engineering - after a lot of conversation and weighing up several options, we were able to convince the previous Flutter contractor to come back to work on the mobile app for us, which we’re pretty excited about. We’re likely going to augment his capacity with an engineer from one of the outsourced engineering platforms, likely from Toptal, so that we are not single-threaded. We feel good about the cost here and getting the mobile app done by mid-October time frame.

NDD web app design - we put some real elbow grease into the Figma files this week and iterated a bunch on the layout of the home page, getting to hopefully a good spot. Outside of that, their designs for pages such as adding patients, making payments, adding appointments are coming along well.  We will see a first look at brand images (e.g. – logos/colors) next week.  Im hoping they are good so we have something fun to share.

Product name - we have landed on Link as the payment engagement app name, so Mural Link will be our first product...and will likely be the name for the “platform” on top of which the products plug into (e.g. – payments, communications, transportation, recruitment, eConsent, eCOA etc etc). Branding will help align us on a beneficial pricing structure where we will be able to charge for the platform and its components.  NDD is working on designs for the Link brand also.  Mural Link was cleared by the Trademark atty.

409a & options issuance: to round out the 409a, we are asking the board to consent to the $0.27 per common share valuation. Steve, let us know if you want to discuss, but we are waiting on your final approval in Carta.  You should have received an email from Carta this past week.  Search your email for “Every Neighbor Deserves Kindness Inc. sent you a board consent to sign.” We will want to award our first product hire, Emma Eikermann, 25 bps (5 year

Veeva v Medidata Lawsuit – This week Medidata’s lawsuit against Veeva ended when a Judge in NY district court threw out the case.  This is good because any suit regarding non-competes in our space is going to attempt to revolve around a claim about confidential information being shared.

Hi Team,

I am headed back to PR tomorrow for the month of August in case anyone wants to come see me!  I will be back in PA on a permanent basis on Labor day weekend.  We accelerated that timing in order to more easily manage some of our personal logistics with the kids and the new baby.  But it will also make managing the growing team a little easier too…most of the current and upcoming hires will be in/around the Philadelphia area.  Below is a screen shot from our Friday call:

On another interesting note, a friend sent me this article after I asked him “when do our brains start to fade…we are getting older!” According to this data from HBR it doesn’t seem to be in your 40s…so I have at least a few more years left.  I thought you might be interested in this article too as investors.

Highlights:

Emma Eikermann: Emma started with Mural Health this week as a Product Manager.  Im seeing great signals from her.  She immediately rolled up her sleeves and started taking ownership.  She is a self-starter, not afraid to speak up, and is instituting structure on our product process. We are cautiously optimistic about her carrying the product function well.

Mobile App Dev: After interviewing a few more devs, we have ultimately decided to go with Bruno, a Flutter dev based in Brazil through a platform called Gun.io as our primary Flutter dev. While we had the choice to re-up with our previous Flutter contractor, we are more excited about Bruno because he feels more reliable, has better Flutter experience, and we have an option to bring him on full-time at a pretty attractive rate. He is in a good time zone for us and communicates well. He will be starting next week. GSD.

Paul Dierksen: We sent an offer to Paul Dierksen as a first sales hire. He is excited about the role but, as expected, he is struggling to figure out how to make the jump to a new role. His W2 last year at Endpoint was about $400k. My initial offer includes $180k base, commission plan, and options that are broken into tranches whereby vesting starts based on three triggers (start date, $3mm in TTM bookings and $6mm in TTM bookings). His biggest issue as of Friday is going from $400k cash comp to $180k. I asked the recruiter to put his head together with Paul and come back to me with a counter in order to bridge the gap (assuring him that I think there is a way to get this done).  I think Paul values the opportunity and he will get there. I have a few levers to pull in order to help bridge the gap but I want to wait to see what they come back with first.  I suspect the way to solve this problem is a bonus in years 1 and 2 based on achieving bookings goals (team goals). My goal is to incentivize $2.5mm in bookings in year 1 and $5mm by the end of 2024 with accelerators between $2.5 and $3.0 and $5mm and $6.0mm.  If you have any input or creative ideas let me know.  I also think he needs to be talked through the options opportunity...Im pretty sure he doesn't understand how options work (this is soooo common in my experience).

New Deal Design: Work continues on user interface.  We also got a first look at logo concepts.  Many options were presented and we talked through the elements of different options we liked (and didnt like)...the team will refine their work next week and we will dial it in.

CNS Summit: I had a second call with CNS Summit (Note - Dawn Brockett is super freaking interesting. She lives in Boise but, in a her 1st life, she was the sous chef of a michelin star restaurant in Europe...I think she said it was The Fat Duck - anyway...she is awesome.  I sent her a set of knives that I had hand made by a young guy in Naranjito (Puerto Rico) who is a knife artisan (this is my favorite gift to give).

We will most definitely launch at the CNS Summit.  It is incredibly well attended.  And Greenphire is not registered...and Im pretty sure my new pal Dawn might be happy to help box them out (Note - the application process is real...Andrew see below).

I have to figure out what we will end up buying (speaking slots etc).  I suspect we will do some sort of sponsorship that will also set us up for 1-on-1 meetings.  I expect 4 of us to attend which would drive 48 meetings over the weekend.  We would try to minimize overlap and drive sales activity.  I also expect we would do a "new solutions presentation" and then I would likely host a 50 minute thought leadership including some other people from the industry...Im thinking through topics...first thought is that it will revolve around innovation...including voices of a site, sponsor, and possibly a PE investors...along with another tech company (note - I have a theory that PE ownership stifles innovation across the largest tech companies in the space...so it might be fun to have someone defend the PE investor)....the session is a work in progress.

@Andrew - I asked Dawn about the application process.  All newcomers are reviewed (likely by Amir Kalali and Dawn) and not everyone is granted entry.  Once you are in...you stay in.  I asked her about your application and she said "oh I will fast track Andrew...thanks for letting me know" so at least I have some power in some part of the world.  Let me know if you hear something.

Shawns Options & Seed Round: Stay tuned about issuing options for Shawn Milochik (this is an outstanding item from the seed round).  I have to talk through a couple of different paths with him next week...all have pros/cons.  But Im sure it will be fine.  Jason is going to reach out to his contacts next week to try and close up the remaining $265k that is open in the seed round.  If he cant fill it all I can fill it.

Hi Everyone!!

Bruno & Nancy: Two new employees joined us this week our web (Nancy) and mobile developer (Bruno) this week. Bruno is doing some prep work on the mobile app as the screens from New Deal Design are finalized, while Nancy is working on building some of the internal admin screens for the software.  Screen shot from our team meeting below (excluding me...so I could capture everyone else in one screen).

Paul Diercksen: Im happy to report that Paul came back this week accepting our adjusted offer for him for an October 1 start. Our base team is now all assembled (product, engineering, operations, and sales with HR and Marketing as a contractor function for now). The original offer was $180k + 100 bps on outstanding shares in options.  The 100 bps is carved into tranches whereby 50 bps starts vesting on his start date, 25 bps starts vesting when we hit $3mm in TTM bookings and 25 bps starts vesting when we hit $6mm of TTM bookings.  As discussed last week, the initial feedback was that he was struggling to bridge the gap from a $400k W2 to the offer I presented.  I sent him an analysis about the option value across the different enterprise value scenarios (sent over the weekend) showing $100mm $250mm and then $250mm intervals up to $1.25 Bn.  Paul came back to us on Monday asking for a $50k sign on bonus.  We ended up agreeing on a $25k "sign on bonus" paid on his 6th anniversary (dependent on him being an employee) and then I put in place an bonus plan based on team bookings.  He has an opportunity to earn an additional $75k bonus ($50k is earned at $2.5mm in bookings and up to $75k for $3mm in bookings during the FY 2023).  And I agreed to put a similar bonus plan in place for 2024 with specific numbers to be determined in Q4 2023.  My goal in structuring his comp was to align his interests and the company's interests...while creating an environment that would enable him to thrive economically. We will attempt to hire 2-3 additional sales people by the end of this year.

Propharma: LedgerRun is a company that competes with Greenphire on investigator payment technology.  They do not have a patient payment tech and they want to leverage our system to act as their patient payment solution where clients want both investigator and patient payment tech.  This week I ran our first sales meeting (thanks to LedgerRun) with ProPharma. ProPharma had positive reactions to my presentation.  This was good considering I only had black and white screen shots to show. They are currently using Greenphire. They seemed to latch on to our ability to quantify patient satisfaction and identify patients at risk of dropping out of a study.  They were also interested in how they could use our setup manager to drive revenue for them. This sales meeting was unexpected but I was happy to do it since it fell in our laps.  The procurement guy, Michael, followed up the next day and said he was happy to continue the conversation and he would be excited to see what we have built when we were ready. LedgerRun also followed up the next day to ask me if I would be agreeable to a partnership whereby they can offer Mural Link as a standard offering on all of their proposals - they’ve had 13 wins YTD 2022 with a growing pipeline so maybe we’d get a few wins out of LedgerRun in 2023 as a channel.  I am waiting on them to propose terms on that relationship...they are likely to want a piece of the bookings or something similar.

New Deal Design: We had our "mid-phase II" readout this week, meaning we are mostly done with our web wireframes. We’re providing another significant round of feedback, after which I think we will have broken the back of the problem on the web side. In a few weeks, we expect to get a first pass of the mobile wireframes as well as some directions for the marketing website.
Jason’s Angels: Jason reached out to his group of angels this week, which consisted mostly of colleagues from Advent and various pharma tech operators. He’s received verbal commitments from 3 so far, and we will continue to follow-up with them next week. I have an investor called Frank van Lint who is interested in filling the balance of what is available.

FinTech Back End: I have had interactions with both Stripe and Evolve Bank & Trust this week to help their Risk Management people understand what we do, the industry that we operate in, and the associated risk.  This is a pretty standard part of the process during the setup period with a new vendor/partner that enables the movement of money.  Its also a bit of a nail biter in the sense that clinical trials are never understood so I end up having to educate people of various levels of sophistication about what we do...in a way that does not cause them to unjustly raise any red flags (when people dont understand something it can be easier for them to "say no").  Stripe asked me to get a legal analysis done to support the idea that we are NOT a money transmitter.  I reached out to a lawyer named Sean Ruff at Cooley (referred to me by a guy I know in the payments industry) to see if he could help.  I let him know about our the seed round and our relationship Bessemer (and I cc'd Josh Rottner for awareness).  I havent heard back from him yet and I will likely follow up on Monday.  Not sure if you can help poke him or ask Josh to give him a nudge.  I will let you know if I reach any roadblocks with the fintech component of our setup.  I expect that your fintech team(s) might be able to help in the event that I encounter an issue.

Hi All

Vic Mallory: This week we hired Vic Mallory (start date after labor day). He is another backend engineer, who was once one of the top engineers at Greenphire. Vic left Greenphire in Dec 2021 to take a break, but is excited to work with Shawn again.

Courtney Valeo:  Greenphire HR confronted Courtney this week in an attempt to intimidate her. They said “rumor has it you are going to work with Sam Whitaker…he isn’t well regarded around here.” (<--lol. Im probably about to become even less well regarded). She was strong and stuck to her script although she said she was caught off guard and her reaction probably confirmed their suspicion. But she is in good shape and this is nothing different than what would be expected. So the secret is likely out.  I expect, at some point, that there will likely be some legal jousting, but we are prepared for it...and I suspect it will not happen for at least a few months.

Logo!!: We are continuing to iterate with NDD and this week we have finalized our logo! We look like a freshly minted tech unicorn. Next step - sign a few contracts!  The below are screen shots (not high def)

Shawn Options: As you know, we finalized Shawn’s options this week and mimicked the qualities of equity that the other founders hold i.e. very long exercise period.

Steve - can sign the board consent in Carta when you have a chance.

Jason’s Angels: Jason finalized his angels allocation this week, and we were ~4x oversubscribed, which is always a great sign. The whale is Jason Krantz, founder/chairman of Definitive Healthcare, who wanted to put in $1M, but was ok with a much smaller allocation in hopes of a bigger one for series A. We’ll close out the investments in the coming weeks.

FinTech Lawyer: Stripe has asked us for a legal analysis / memo from counsel indicating that we are NOT a money transmitter or a regulated financial institution.  This is not unexpected and I have dealt with this before with Greenphire.  I had a disappointing experience with Cooley this week.  I could probably work with them if I had to.  I was stood up by one Partner and then shuffled to Of Counsel who has yet to follow up with an engagement letter. He seemed less enthusiastic about helping me navigate the Money Transmitter issue in a creative way that would accomplish our goals.  As an alternative, I scheduled a call with Jonathan Levin who is a retired lawyer from Reed Smith and working in his own practice now.  He is giving me what I need and will help me get a memo together to support the position that we are NOT a money transmitter.  Or, alternatively, he will help us to structure our operation in a way that will help us avoid the related issues.  Stripe represents a, likely, temporary solution for us.  It is a quick way for us to stand up our MVP and provide our tech with push-to-debit functionality.  The longer term solution will be to work with a company like Evolve Bank & Trust or JP Morgan (I have an intro meeting to the team at JP Morgan next week).  Both organizations will help us have a more bullet proof solution to money transmitter issues/risk.  And both will give us access to payment functionality similar to (or more robust) than Stripe.  I can talk with you all more about this if you are interested.

Additional Sales Recruits: I have an intro call scheduled next week with Dave Hine.  Dave was a Sales Engineed at Greenphire (I did not work with him) focusing his efforts on their patient-payment solution (ClinCard).  He left Greenphire because he was frustrated that he was closing wins but the sales people who arranged the meetings were getting paid on the win.  He left GP to go to Cluepoints as a sales person but then left to go to a CRO.  He has a good reputation from GP.  And the head of sales at Cluepoints also speaks highly of him.  He likely has an over inflated sense of his own value...but lets see how this unfolds.  He could be a good pick up for an early sales team, especially since he has experiencing selling this product category...and knowledge of our primary competitor.  He has been gone from GP for 15 months and has an 18 month non compete...so that shouldnt be an issue given a Nov launch.   Paul Diercksen also interviewed a sales person this week (Danilo Belloso) but I havent met him yet.  I will help Paul evaluate Danilo over the next week or two.

Correlation Reporting:  Correlation Ventures reached out to us this week to lay out all of their reporting requirements.  I had a text conversation with Wesley Barrow (my contact at Correlation) and explained that we didnt have the resources to produce different packages for each of our investors.  My plan is to share the deck/excel that I prepare for BVP with the other institutional investors (the same materials) and then I will hold a virtual "office hour" each month in the event that any of the other minority investors want to connect and ask questions  etc.

Restrictive Covenants Agreement:  I have a draft restrictive covenants agreement completed for our employees.  I am going to work on having all employees execute it.  If you are interested in reviewing it let me know.  It was drafted by Rachel Kushel who is the labor attorney Steve connected me with to explore non compete issues. (Note - I would recommend her to others who need a labor attorney)

Pricing:  I have started thinking about pricing for this platform but I am going to wait until I can see if I can get current insight into Greenphire's pricing.  Dave Hine (see above in sales hires) will have guidance on this front.  I am also scheduled to meet with Ryan Kelly in early September to get a download on modern-day Greenphire.  He was a product manager at GP for their site-payments product and has left to go to Auxillius

Hi All,

I hope you are enjoying the weekend!  See below for my notes.  Nothing in here is especially exciting.  A special thanks is due to Andrew, this week, for helping me overcome an issue with Uber Health.  Thanks, Andrew!!!

Uber: We had a strange hiccup with Uber this week.  Out of the blue then emailed us on Thursday night (after shutting off our dev access) claiming that they have a new requirements...that we commit to $400k of booking revenue to Uber in our first year or we have to pay them $20,000.  With Andrew's help, we connected with the global head of Uber Health (who I will meet next week) and she has already eliminated the fees for us and cleared our path to continue development.

Money Transmitter Legal Analysis: Jonathan Levin (independent legal referred by Geoff Schwartz and retired from Reed Smith) is working on the legal memo to satisfy Stripe.  I should have a draft of that next week.

JP Morgan: Met with JP Morgan to explore treasury / payment services...we are navigating their internal processes in order to get to a place where I can get a capabilities presentation...and figure out what they can offer to strengthen our backend payment tech.  I also brought up the idea of creating an innovative credit product to allow us to “lend” issuance dollars to our customer is advance of payment distribution to participants.  The staus quo is a "prefunding" model where the client has "load" and account with money to be distributed to participants. (Our credit (i.e. post-funding) model would be a disruptive model relative to GP and others in the market)…however, I think this is likely a heavy lift concept and, at the moment, is low probability but it is worth exploring)

New Deal Design: This week marked the end of phase II, so we are done with wireframes for web and native apps. Phase III will be the process of developing visual designs for the wireframes. We’re also starting the design for the marketing website. Meanwhile, the engineers have been focusing on building infrastructure so that we are ready to replicate screens once the designs are out, and building the internal facing parts of the software used for setting up clients and sites.  The design lead (Anoushka) who was running our project quit this week and we are transitioning to a new lead.  This introduces some risk to our project but we dont think it is likely significant.

Office Space: Negotiating 2 dedicated spaces at a very local coworking space in PA that I have connectivity to the husband/wife owners (https://workatcolab.com/faq) - we will keep rent cost as low as possible as long as possible…this will just be for me and Courtney at the moment…so we can be low maintenance.  I am looking at a couple other alternatives in the same area as back ups.

Pricing Model: We completed a first draft of a pricing model.  This is a work in progress.  I got a download on Greenphire’s current day ClinCard pricing and it seems that our first swing at pricing represents both A) a structural advantage (i.e. - no setup fees which both eliminates risk to sponsors and also creates a revenue opportunity for all of our channel partners like CROs or other tech companies) and B) likely represents a slightly better price point (GPs prices seem to have gone up since I was there)…stay tuned as this is still developing.

Deck / Financials / Investor Update: I will have a pretty basic deck out to you all mid-week next week, in advance of our Aug 25 meeting) along with July financials.  I will distribute the same materials to the other institutional investors.  I will have a monthly call with Virtue and offer up an “office hour” for everyone else if they want to come and ask questions etc.

Salesforce: I started to put in place SFDC and will work with Paul Diercksen and on of the angel investors from Project Mayhem who has a SFDC admin/consulting firm…I will see if their prices are reasonable to set up SFDC in an optimized way…otherwise Jason and I will figure it out on our own.

Additional Sales Recruits: I met with Dave Hine this week who as a reminder, was a Sales Engineer at Greenphire focusing on the ClinCard product and had success in that role. He left to be a salesperson at CluePoints and now at a CRO. Dave is clearly smart and driven, but it’s unclear if he is a good cultural fit and could end up being high maintenance. Next steps - Jason and Paul will each speak to him next week so everyone could get to know each other.  We are also interviewing a guy named Danilo Beloso who I interviewed yesterday.  He could be a good addition...and is likely worth giving a try.

Jordan Wan / SiteRx: I talked to Seth Goodman (CEO of SiteRx referred by Jordan Wan) this week about Jordan Wan.  Seth was underwhelming and gave Jordan an "ok" review.  Jordan sounds like a good guy who is quick to be helpful but Seth didnt give me the impression that his input had a material impact on his ability to sell more.  Im going to follow up with Jordan next week to get a bit more insight into his sales team consulting work...but Im guessing we could just hire him to do that work and pay him cash vs expanding the round to make room for him.  If you all have any additional opinions feel free to share.  I want to make sure Im not missing something.
