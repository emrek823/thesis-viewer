Without limiting its obligations above in this Section 6, Vendor shall comply with the provisions of Rider: Requirements for the Protection of Harvard Personally Identifiable Information, attached as Exhibit C.

## 7. Security and Use of Harvard Systems.

Vendor shall implement and maintain a written information security program, consistent with applicable laws and industry leading practices, that contains reasonable administrative, physical, and technical security measures designed to protect the security, confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the Confidential Information accessed and processed by Vendor. Vendor's information security program shall include, at a minimum, the maintenance of firewalls, anti-virus solutions, internal controls, security monitoring, appropriate network security and encryption technologies, the use of reasonable user identification or password control requirements including multiple-factor authentication and session time-outs, and other similar precautions to protect against the unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information. Vendor will conduct periodic risk assessments and remediate any identified security vulnerabilities in a timely manner. Upon Harvard's written request, Vendor shall provide Harvard with a copy of Vendor's then-current information security policy. Upon any discovery of an Information Security Breach, Vendor will investigate, remediate, and mitigate the effects of the Information Security Breach, and provide Harvard with assurances reasonably satisfactory to Harvard that such Information Security Breach will not recur. If any Information Security Breach occurs as a result of a wrongful or negligent act or omission of Vendor or Vendor's subcontractors, Vendor will, at Vendor's sole expense, undertake remedial measures (including notice, credit monitoring services, fraud insurance and the establishment of a call center to respond to inquiries by affected individuals, as appropriate or required by law) in accordance with Harvard's reasonable instructions.

(i) If and when Vendor is providing or performing Services on Harvard's premises, Vendor will comply and will cause its employees and contractors to comply with Harvard's security, safety, and other applicable policies and procedures that are made known to Vendor and will avoid endangering the safety of any person and interfering with Harvard's business. While at any Harvard location or if Vendor is given access to any Harvard network or computer or other systems (“Harvard Systems”), Vendor and its employees and contractors will follow all reasonable directions and instructions given by Harvard and will use Harvard Systems only to the extent necessary to provide or perform the Services. If Vendor is given a key, code, combination or other access device to Harvard's premises or if Vendor is given any access codes, passwords or credentials to any Harvard Systems (collectively “Access Devices”), Vendor will: (a) safeguard them with the same degree of care as Vendor safeguards Access Devices to its own premises or systems, but in no event with less than reasonable care; (b) maintain a log and on request provide copies to Harvard of the names of personnel who have possession of such Access Devices and when they use them, and immediately notify Harvard of any change to such personnel; and (c) return or destroy (such that all relevant data cannot practicably be read or reconstructed) all such Access Devices immediately upon request by Harvard and in any case on completion of the Services or SOW (as applicable). Vendor must ensure that any computers or portable computing devices used by Vendor to communicate with Harvard Systems directly or remotely (“Vendor Computers”) meet the following security requirements:
    (ii) Vendor Computer locks after a period of idle time and requires reauthentication of the Permitted Person via their individual password/passcode or biometric identifier to unlock;
    (iii) Vendor Computer runs a supported and updated operating system;
    (iv) Vendor Computer runs software with current patches and security updates applied;
    (v) Vendor Computer runs a supported and updated anti-malware service; and
    (vi) Vendor Computer uses encrypted storage for data saved to hard drive.

## 9. Use of Harvard Names.

### 9.1

Vendor shall not use the name "Harvard" (alone or as part of another name, and in any language) or any logo, seal, insignia or other word, name, symbol, image or device that identifies Harvard or any Harvard school, unit, division or affiliate (“Harvard Names”) for any promotional purpose, including without limitation in any press release, public announcement, social media, website or other advertising materials, except as expressly provided in this Agreement or the SOW, or with the prior written approval of, and in accordance with restrictions required by, Harvard. Vendor shall not register, in any jurisdiction, any business or company name, trademark, service mark, domain name or trade name, or obtain any other type of registration, that contains or is confusingly similar to any Harvard Name.

## 10. Indemnification.

### 10.1

Vendor agrees to indemnify and hold Harvard and its contracting units, affiliates, employees, faculty members, students, members of its governing boards and agents harmless from and against any third party claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses including reasonable attorneys' fees arising out of or relating to Vendor's breach of any warranty or provision of this Agreement, infringement or misappropriation or other violation of intellectual property rights by Work Product, Output, and/or Vendor Materials (excluding Harvard Materials) or any other negligent or willful act or omission of Vendor. Vendor shall not be obliged to pay or indemnify any settlement amount unless it has consented to the settlement, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. Vendor shall not settle any indemnified claim without the consent of Harvard, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.

### 10.2

## 11. Remedies.

Vendor acknowledges that any remedy at law for any violation of the provisions of this Agreement regarding Confidential Information, Harvard's rights in Work Product and Output, and the use of Harvard Names, may be inadequate and that Harvard may suffer irreparable damage through any such violation and that therefore, in addition to any other remedies it may have, Harvard may seek and obtain injunctive relief against a breach or threatened breach of such obligations of Vendor.

All required liability insurances shall specifically name as additional insureds, with respect to the goods and/or services delivered, “President and Fellows of Harvard College, its subsidiary, contracting units, and affiliated companies, and officers, directors, members of governing boards, employees and agents of any of them." The endorsement granting additional insured status must state that the insurance afforded these additional insureds applies on a primary basis with respect to any other insurance or self-insurance available to the additional insureds, which will apply only on an excess and non-contributory basis.

### 12.3

The Vendor's Workers Compensation and Employers Liability insurance must contain a waiver of the right of the insurer to obtain a recovery for claim payments made by the insurer.

### 12.4

Any liability insurance purchased by Vendor on a “claims-made” basis must be continuously maintained for a period equal to the applicable statute of repose, but no less than 3 years, following termination of all SOWs and final delivery of Work Product and Output, either through the continued purchase of insurance or the purchase of an extended reporting period. The retroactive date applicable to such “claims-made” insurance, if any, must precede the first date on which Services are to be provided or performed.

### 12.5

Vendor covenants that all required insurance shall be maintained until the provision of Services under all SOWs are complete and all Work Product and Output has been accepted by Customer. Vendor shall furnish Customer with certificates of insurance giving evidence of the insurance and endorsements required by this Section prior to the commencement of providing or performing the Services. Vendor shall furnish certificates of insurance or policy binders evidencing renewal or replacement coverage for such insurance to Customer not less than thirty (30) calendar days prior to expiration of any such policies. Certificates of insurance shall provide for, or Vendor shall give, at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice to Customer of non-renewal, cancellation or material modification of any required policy. Upon request of Customer, Vendor shall provide Harvard or Customer with a certified copy of any policy of insurance required by this Section or, after providing Vendor with a reasonable amount of notice, Customer may inspect Vendor's insurance policies at its corporate offices.

### 12.6

The insurance coverages and limits required are designed to meet the minimum requirements of Customer. They are not designed as a recommended insurance program for Vendor or its subcontractors. Customer may elect at any time to require Vendor to procure and maintain other additional insurance. Notice of such election shall be given at least sixty (60) days prior to the effective date of the required modifications.

### 12.7

No provision of this Section shall abridge, diminish, or affect Vendor's responsibility for the consequences of any accidents, occurrences, damages, losses, and associated costs arising out of or resulting from performance of the Agreement or any SOW.

## 13. Right to Audit; Cloud Providers.

Once per calendar year and during normal business hours, and at its own expense, Harvard shall have the right to audit the Vendor for compliance with contractual obligations. At Harvard's sole discretion, any such audit may be conducted by either Harvard's own staff or by a third party auditor under contract to Harvard. For purposes of any audit, Vendor shall grant Harvard or such third party reasonable access to any Vendor (but in the case of nationally recognized third party cloud and hosting service providers, such as Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure or Google Cloud, only if permitted by the applicable cloud or hosting service provider) facilities, operations, documentation, databases, and personnel used in performance of the Agreement.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Vendor may use the following nationally recognized third party cloud and hosting service providers, Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure or Google Cloud to store and process data in accordance with industry standards and the terms of this Agreement. Upon Customer's reasonable request, Vendor will make available to Customer any audits reports or certifications that its subcontractor(s) providing cloud or hosting services generally make available to Vendor and its customers, subject to Customer's agreement to comply with any confidentiality or other terms or conditions required by such subcontractor or its auditors.

## 14. Notices.

Any notice under this Agreement or a SOW may be delivered in person, or sent by fax (with the original sent promptly by ordinary mail), by electronic mail, by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, or by recognized delivery service, using the most recent contact information provided by the recipient (by means of notice complying with this paragraph), and such notice shall be deemed to have been given when delivered as evidenced by confirmation, sent by electronic mail (unless the sender receives notice that delivery of the transmittal failed).

## 15. Governing Law.

The Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts without regard to its rules of conflict of laws. All disputes hereunder shall be resolved in the applicable state or federal courts of Massachusetts. The Parties consent to the jurisdiction of such courts and waive any jurisdictional or venue defenses otherwise available.

## 16. Independent Contractor.

Vendor shall be an independent contractor, free from Harvard's direction and control of the means and methods of providing and performing the Services, and not an agent or employee of Harvard. Vendor shall have no authority to incur any obligations or expenses on behalf of Harvard or to act in any other manner on behalf of Harvard or in its name. Vendor shall be solely responsible under all applicable laws for all (i) compensation and expenses of Vendor's employees and contractors, (ii) taxes on Vendor's income, (iii) tax withholdings and welfare and benefits payments and contributions required with respect to Vendor and Vendor's employees and contractors, (iv) Vendor's professional and other licensing fees, and (v) other taxes owed to any governmental authority in connection with the Services, except as otherwise provided in a SOW. Neither Vendor nor any of Vendor's employees or contractors shall be entitled to receive any employee benefits from Harvard.

## 17. Assignment; Subcontracting.

This Agreement may not be assigned by either Party, nor transferred by operation of law, without the prior written consent of the other; however, either Party may assign in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or substantially all of its assets or stock upon written notice to the other Party. Any assignment or transfer without such required consent shall be void. In the event of such merger, acquisition, or sale of a Party involving an entity that is prohibited or barred from receiving funds in connection with, or participating in, government funded programs or which Harvard is not permitted to do business under applicable laws or regulations or has a good faith demonstrable concern relating to doing business with, the non-assigning Party may terminate the Agreement immediately without penalty upon written notice to the assigning Party, and in the case of Harvard, will receive a refund of all unused fees paid to Vendor for the remainder of the then current annual subscription period following the date of such merger, acquisition, or sale with any such entity, due and payable within thirty (30) days of Harvard's termination. This termination right will expire if not timely executed within 60 days of Vendor notifying Harvard of any such merger, acquisition, or sale in writing. Vendor shall not engage any third party to provide or perform any portion of the Services without Harvard's prior written consent, except as pre-approved under Section 13 or the applicable SOW. If Harvard approves the engagement of a third party (including any hosting service), Vendor shall require that the third party adhere to all applicable obligations of Vendor under this Agreement (including, but not limited to the Confidentiality, Use of Harvard Names and Rights in Work Product provisions of this Agreement) and shall enforce and be responsible for such third party's adherence; with respect to nationally recognized cloud and hosting service providers, the Parties acknowledge and agree that agreements with them may be on their standard terms but in no event will Vendor knowingly enter into new terms that conflict with this Agreement. Nonetheless, Vendor shall remain fully responsible to Harvard for the provision and performance of the Services and all other obligations of Vendor under this Agreement. Harvard shall not be liable for any payments due to such third party.

## 18. Severability.

In the event that any provision of this Agreement is held invalid by any court, the remainder of the Agreement shall remain in force unless the invalid provision materially affects the rights of the Parties.

## 19. Non-Waiver.

Any waiver by either Party of a breach of any provision of this Agreement or a SOW must be in writing and shall not be deemed a waiver of any subsequent breach. No delay or omission by either Party in the exercise or enforcement of any right or remedy provided in this Agreement or a SOW, or by law, shall be construed as a waiver of such right or remedy.

## 20. Entire Contract; Amendment; Other Agreements.

This Agreement, together with any SOWs and any other attachments, riders, exhibits, or amendments hereto, constitutes the entire contract between the Parties with respect to the Services and supersedes and cancels all previous negotiations, agreements, commitments, and writings relating to the Services. The Agreement or any SOW may be amended only by a written agreement that refers explicitly to this Agreement or the SOW, signed by each of the Parties. The terms of this Agreement shall apply only to the Services and not to any other goods provided to, or services performed by, Vendor for Harvard under any other agreement. Vendor has informed Harvard of all other outstanding agreements between Vendor and Harvard. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, this Agreement does not incorporate, and may not be amended, superseded, or supplemented by, any passive, click-through, or click-wrap agreement or any pages on Vendor's (or any other) Web site that are not specifically referenced in this Agreement.

## 21. Signatures; Counterparts.

Signatures of this Agreement or any SOW may be affixed and exchanged by facsimile, email or other electronic means. This Agreement and any SOW may be signed in counterparts, which shall be effective as a single agreement.

## 22. Limitation of Liability.

(a) EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN THE FOLLOWING SENTENCE, IN NO EVENT SHALL HARVARD OR VENDOR OR EITHER OF THEIR AFFILIATES, SHAREHOLDERS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES OR MEMBERS OF THEIR GOVERNING BOARDS, OR ANY HARVARD FACULTY MEMBER OR STUDENT, BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES WHATSOEVER IN CONNECTION WITH CLAIMS ARISING UNDER OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SERVICES, WHETHER BASED UPON A CLAIM OR ACTION OF CONTRACT, WARRANTY, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY OR CAUSE OF ACTION, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS PARAGRAPH SHALL NOT APPLY TO CLAIMS (INCLUDING CLAIMS FOR INDEMNIFICATION) ARISING UNDER OR RELATED TO (i) OBLIGATIONS WITH RESPECT TO UNAUTHORIZED USE OR DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OR PERSONAL DATA, OR VENDOR'S UNAUTHORIZED USE OF HARVARD NAMES, (ii) A THIRD PARTY CLAIM FOR INFRINGEMENT OR (III) GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT.
(b) A PARTY'S TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY SHALL UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES EXCEED THE GREATER OF (I) TEN TIMES (10X) THE FEES ACTUALLY PAID BY THE CUSTOMER TO VENDOR DURING THE PRIOR TWELVE (12) MONTHS, OR (II) $500,000.00 (THE “CAP"); HOWEVER, THIS CAP WILL NOT APPLY TO CLAIMS ARISING FROM UNAUTHORIZED USE OF HARVARD NAMES; UNAUTHORIZED USE OR DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OR PERSONAL DATA, OR ANY CLAIM BY A THIRD PARTY FOR INFRINGEMENT INDEMNIFICATION, OR AS PROVIDED BELOW IN CLAUSE (C).

# Exhibit A
## Service Level Agreement

This Service Level Agreement (“SLA”) is incorporated into, and governed by the terms and conditions of, the SaaS Master Services Agreement ("Agreement”) between the President and Fellows of Harvard College, a nonprofit Massachusetts corporation, by and through its Harvard School of Dental Medicine ("Harvard") and 32Health, Inc. (“Vendor"). The purpose of this SLA is to specify the technical support required by Harvard and the expected level of services from Vendor during the term of the Agreement.

### 1. Availability.

Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to make the Services available for access over the Internet at least 99.9% of the time during each month of the Term, except for Scheduled Maintenance and the reasons expressly listed below in 1(a).

a. **Exceptions:** The availability guarantee set forth above shall not apply to the following service interruptions:
    i. **Scheduled Maintenance and Upgrades:**
        1. **"Scheduled Maintenance"** means routine maintenance on the Platform that is scheduled at least 24 hours ahead and which results in less than one (1) hour of unavailability of the SaaS Services. To the maximum extent possible, Scheduled Maintenance shall take place outside regular business hours (9am - 5pm EST), and if that is not possible, such maintenance shall be scheduled during the lowest expected level of activity on the SaaS Services based on recent activity on the SaaS Services. Vendor will give Harvard at least 24 hours advance notice of routine scheduled maintenance. Scheduled Maintenance occurring more than once in any one calendar month will count against the SaaS Services availability calculation.
        2. **"Extensive Scheduled Maintenance"** means maintenance on the SaaS Services that is scheduled at least 7 days ahead and which results in more than one (1) hour and less than three (3) hours of unavailability of the SaaS Services. Vendor will schedule extensive scheduled maintenance during the lowest expected level of activity on the Platform based on recent activity on the Platform. Vendor will give Harvard at least seven (7) days advance notice of extensive scheduled maintenance. An Extensive Scheduled Maintenance occurring more than once in one calendar month will count against the SaaS Services availability calculation.
        3. **"Upgrades"** are defined as updates to the SaaS Services. Upgrades will be applied during a Scheduled Maintenance window or other mutually agreed timeframe.
    ii. Failures related to Harvard's systems and Internet access, and any interruption in the Services due to causes beyond the control of Vendor, including, without limitation: loss or theft of data; interruption or failure of telecommunication or digital transmission links; Internet slow-downs or failure; Domain Name Server (DNS) propagation or DNS issues outside the direct control of Vendor; failures or default of third party software, vendors, or products; and communications, network/internet connection, or utility interruption or failure (“Uncontrolled SaaS Services Interruption").
    iii. Outages due to Harvard-requested events, such as intrusive testing.

b. **Availability Calculation.** Availability shall be calculated using the following formula:

([24hrs x days in the applicable month] – Scheduled Maintenance – Extensive Scheduled Maintenance – Uncontrolled SaaS Service Interruption – hours of unplanned interruption)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
([24hrs x days in the applicable month] – Scheduled Maintenance – Extensive Scheduled Maintenance - Uncontrolled SaaS Service Interruption)

c. **Scope of Technical Support.** The purpose of Technical Support is to correct any failure or lack of availability of the SaaS Services. Vendor shall: (a) respond to all support requests; (b) provide updates on all support requests; and (c) Resolve all support requests, each in accordance with the specified times and other terms set forth herein. “Resolve" (including "Resolved," "Resolution," and correlative capitalized terms) means that Vendor has either provided a mutually acceptable workaround or corrected the error resulting in a fully operational restoration of the SaaS Services. Harvard shall e-mail Vendor at hds_support@32health.care or call Vendor at 757-524-2273 to request support and open a trouble ticket.

d. **Severity Levels.** Each support request shall be categorized by Harvard into one of the following severity levels.

| Severity Level | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Resolution time                         |
| :------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| Level 1        | Severe error that results in the SaaS Services experiencing complete unavailability and/or halting data input.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Within one (1) business day (9am - 5pm EST) |
| Level 2        | Serious error that results in a major function of the SaaS Services suffering a reasonably reproducible problem causing either major inconvenience to Harvard or an authorized user or consistent failure in a common functionality.                                                                                                    | Within one (1) business day             |
| Level 3        | An error that results in a common functionality experiencing an intermittent problem or a consistent failure in a less common functionality. There is no material impact on business activity. | Within three (3) business days          |
| Level 4        | How-to type of questions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Within five (5) business days           |

### 2.

Vendor shall provide backup and restoration services for Harvard's instance of the SaaS Services. The backup interval shall be every 24 hours, and the restoration interval shall be within 4 hours of the request. The backup and restoration services shall be performed in accordance with the Vendor's disaster recovery plan. The disaster recovery plan may be reviewed and updated annually by the Parties upon Harvard's request.

### 3. Remedy.

In the event a Service Level is not met in a 30-day period, Vendor will refund monthly fees pro-rated based on the duration or percentage of the non-compliance. Refunds shall be paid within 60 days following the month in which the failure occurred or as a lump sum of accumulated credits upon expiration or termination of the applicable Order, at Harvard's option.

### 4. Recurring Failure.

In the event Vendor fails to achieve a Service Level Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to correct such loss or interruption as quickly as practicable. In the event Vendor (i) fails to achieve a Service Level for three (3) months during any six month period the Term, then Harvard may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice to Vendor, and Harvard shall be owed a refund of prepaid fees prorated from the beginning of the three (3) month outage to the date of such termination.; or (ii) if a Service Level is not met if the SaaS Services are available less for a than 90% of the time in a thirty (30) day period, Harvard may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice to Vendor, and Vendor will refund Harvard all prepaid, unused fees prorated through the date of termination.

### 5. Reporting.

Vendor will provide monthly reports including Service Level compliance, as well as all Harvard trouble tickets with duration, time and resolution. For Severity One outages, Vendor will also conduct a root cause analysis with Harvard, upon request.

# Exhibit C
## Rider: Requirements for the Protection of Harvard Personally Identifiable Information

As stated in the SaaS Master Services Agreement (in this Rider, the “Agreement”), between President and Fellows of Harvard College, a nonprofit Massachusetts corporation, acting through its Harvard School of Dental Medicine (in this Rider, “Harvard”) and 32Health, Inc. (in this Rider, “Service Provider"), this Rider is added to and incorporated as part of the Agreement. In the event of any conflict between the terms of this Rider and the Agreement, the terms of this Rider shall govern.

### 1.

For purposes of this Rider, “Personal Data” shall mean any of the following types of personally identifiable information, in any form or media, about current or former Harvard faculty members, employees, students, prospective students, research subjects, other persons associated with Harvard and other individuals: an individual's social security number, tax identification number, military identification number, health insurance identification number, bank or financial account numbers or other identifiable individual financial information, information that would permit access to online accounts, credit or debit card numbers, driver's license number, passport number, other government-issued identification numbers, biometric or genetic data, health and medical information, identifiable data about the individual obtained through a research project, employee benefits information, education records, Harvard identification numbers, any information about an individual that has been marked as private, and any additional types of personally identifiable information about individuals that Harvard from time to time designates in writing as Personal Data.

### 2.

In addition to complying with other provisions of the Agreement requiring the protection of confidential information, the Service Provider shall:

(i) implement and maintain reasonable administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of Personal Data which shall be at least as protective of such information as the safeguards for personal information set forth in 201 Code of Massachusetts Regulations 17.00;
(ii) not collect, store, process, transmit or disclose Personal Data or allow such use of Personal Data for any purpose other than the performance of services for Harvard;
(iii) limit access to Personal Data to Service Provider's employees and contractors who have a specific need for such access in order to perform Service Provider's services for Harvard (each, a “Permitted Person”), provided that Service Provider shall not transfer or give access to Personal Data to any contractor performing the services without Harvard's prior written approval;
(iv) not at any time during or after the term of the Agreement disclose Personal Data to any person, other than Permitted Persons and Harvard personnel in connection with performance of the services, except with Harvard's prior written approval (or except as required by law, in which case Service Provider shall, unless prohibited by law, notify Harvard prior to such disclosure);
(v) obtain written approval from Harvard prior to implementation by Service Provider of any remote (including Internet) access to Personal Data by anyone (including any Harvard personnel or students) who is not a Permitted Person;
(vi) cause all Personal Data to be encrypted when transmitted by Service Provider or Permitted Persons via the Internet or any other public network, or wirelessly;
(vii) ensure that Service Provider or contractor computer systems that collect, store, process, or provide access to any Personal Data are secured according to widely used standards such as PCI DSS, ISO 27000, or NIST 800-53;
(viii) ensure that Service Provider and Permitted Persons do not store Personal Data in any unencrypted portable computing device and do not store Personal Data in any unencrypted portable storage media, for example DVDs, flash drives or backup tapes;
(ix) use measures to prevent unauthorized access to paper records containing Personal Data while such papers are being stored, used or transmitted that are reasonable in the circumstances;
(x) either provide to Harvard on request the results of any Service Organization Control Type 2 or 3 (SOC 2 or SOC 3) or equivalent audit of Service Provider's services and system completed within the last 24 months or permit Harvard or its designee to conduct such an audit, not more often than annually and at Harvard's expense; and either provide to Harvard on request the results of any vulnerability assessment of Service Provider's system completed within the last 12 months or permit Harvard or its designee to conduct such tests from time to time, at Harvard's expense;
(xi) comply with all applicable data protection laws and regulations, and with such additional protections as Harvard shall reasonably request from time to time in order to comply with any applicable legal requirement;
(xii) immediately notify Harvard if it can no longer meet its obligations under applicable data protection laws and regulations or this Rider; and
(xiii) at any time at Harvard's request and in any case upon termination of the services, return Personal Data to Harvard and (unless otherwise required by law) cause all copies of Personal Data in any formats or media, whether held by Service Provider or by a Permitted Person or other person who received Personal Data from Service Provider (including Personal Data held in archives or backups) to be deleted or destroyed, provided that in every case Personal Data shall be disposed of in such a manner that thereafter it cannot practicably be accessed, read or reconstructed from any devices, media or records of any kind held by Service Provider or such Permitted Person or other person.

### 3.

Service Provider shall notify Harvard within forty-eight (48) hours of learning of any confirmed or suspected unauthorized acquisition or use of Personal Data or other confirmed or suspected event involving Personal Data (“Security Incident”). Without limiting any other notification obligations of Service Provider under the Agreement, Service Provider shall provide such notice to privsec-incident-report@harvard.edu. In addition, in the event of a Security Incident:

(i) Service Provider shall (a) cooperate fully with Harvard to investigate, remediate, and mitigate the effects of the Security Incident, and (b) make any legally required notifications to affected individuals, government agencies, credit bureaus, and other required entities. Service Provider shall not make any public announcement identifying Harvard or notify affected individuals regarding a Security Incident without Harvard's prior written approval.
(ii) Service Provider shall reimburse Harvard for its third-party costs arising from or related to the Security Incident to the extent caused by Vendor's breach of this Rider, negligence, or misconduct, including without limitation, reasonable costs relating to notifications, credit monitoring, call centers, forensic analyses, fines and penalties, settlements with third parties, and legal and expert advisors, subject to the other provisions of the Agreement.

### 4.

Service Provider shall ensure and be responsible for compliance by all its employees and contractors with the requirements of this Rider and all confidentiality obligations to Harvard. Service Provider shall enter into written agreements with its subcontractors providing for appropriate data protection measures that are at least as restrictive as the terms of this Rider.

### 5.

Any provisions of the Agreement that exclude from confidentiality treatment any information that is available to Service Provider from third parties, previously known to Service Provider, independently developed by Service Provider, or not specifically designated as confidential by Harvard, shall be inapplicable to Personal Data.

### 6.

The provisions of this Rider shall survive the termination of the Agreement.

# Exhibit D
## Rider: Harvard Digital Accessibility Requirements

This Contract Rider (“Rider”) is added to and incorporated as part of the SaaS Master Services Agreement (in this Rider, the “Agreement”), dated July 25, 2024 between President & Fellows of Harvard College, acting through its Harvard School of Dental Medicine (in this Rider, “Harvard”) and 32Health, Inc. (in this Rider, “Vendor¹”).

### 1. STANDARDS.

For purposes of this Rider, “Standards” means the most recent version of, or successor standards to, the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 Level AA, as published by the Web Accessibility Initiative of the World Wide Web Consortium.

### 2. DELIVERABLES.

For Purposes of this Rider, “Deliverables” means any services, equipment, hardware, software, systems, platforms, technologies, documentation, and content, including all components, features, functionalities, upgrades, versions, and releases thereof, to be provided by Vendor under the Agreement.

### 3. CONFORMANCE WITH STANDARDS.

Vendor hereby represents and warrants that the Deliverables, whether or not web-based, will conform to the Standards. To the extent a Deliverable permits Harvard or third parties to post content for access by others, Vendor will ensure that the Deliverable enables and does not interfere with the ability of content providers to post such content in a format that conforms to the Standards.

### 4. TESTING/AUDITS.

Prior to delivery to Harvard, Vendor shall conduct internal and field testing of the Deliverables, including testing of the Deliverables with applicable assistive technologies covered within the Standards (“Testing"), to ensure the Deliverables' conformance to the Standards. Vendor shall provide accurate and complete written reports of all Testing results to Harvard upon request. In addition, Vendor shall be responsible to conduct annual accessibility evaluations ("Audits") of all user systems developed, hosted, or otherwise managed by Vendor as part of the Deliverables, including any third-party technology or content contained therein, to ensure conformance of such systems to the Standards.

### 5. NOTIFICATION OF NONCONFORMANCE.

Vendor shall notify Harvard if, at any time during performance of the Agreement, whether or not as a result of Testing, Audit, or user complaint, Vendor determines reasonably and in good faith that any element of the Deliverables may not fully conform to the Standards ("Non-Conformance").

### 6. USER FEEDBACK.

Upon Harvard's request, Vendor shall notify Harvard of accessibility complaints from users of the Deliverables. Upon Harvard's request, Vendor shall incorporate into the Deliverables a method by which users may contact knowledgeable persons to report difficulties accessing or using the Deliverables and to direct comments, questions, and complaints regarding accessibility. Vendor shall resolve all accessibility complaints that describe Non-Conformance with the same level of priority as remedying any equivalent loss of function for individuals without disabilities.

### 7. REMEDY.

In the event Vendor reports Non-Conformance as provided in Section 5, fails to resolve Non-Conformance as provided in Section 6, or otherwise fails to comply with the terms of this Rider, Harvard shall work with Vendor reasonably and in good faith to develop an agreed action plan and timeline for curing such breach (“Cure Plan"). Harvard shall not pursue any remedies available at law or in equity under the Agreement, including termination of the Agreement, unless or until the Parties are unable to reach agreement on a Cure Plan or Harvard determines in its discretion that Vendor has not followed or cannot complete the Cure Plan.

### 8. CONFLICT.

In the event of any conflict between the terms of this Rider and the Agreement, the terms of this Rider shall govern.
