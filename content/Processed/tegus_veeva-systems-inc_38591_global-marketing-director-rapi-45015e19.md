**Tegus Client**
Okay. Could you detail your previous and current experience in copy approval/digital asset management?

**Global Marketing Director, Rapid Diagnostics at Abbott**
Okay. So as part of my prior role, both at cardiovascular and current role in diagnostics, I have the downstream marketing responsibilities, which pretty much includes the creation, approval, and execution of all our marketing campaigns and assets. I also have the digital marketing team at the global level reporting into me as well.

So they own the platform strategy when it comes to marketing technology. So governing our marketing automation platform, digital asset management platforms, and other marketing technology platforms that are used at the global level.

**Tegus Client**
Great. And what do you think the biggest challenges to digital asset management are? What keeps you up at night about it?

**Global Marketing Director, Rapid Diagnostics at Abbott**
That's a good question, and it's a very loaded answer. So I don't think it is unique to digital asset management. But integration with the rest of the platforms we have in the ecosystem is the biggest challenge. So it might be an amazing tool as a stand-alone tool but Abbott is a very large company, one of the biggest healthcare companies. You're part of the global organization.

So the complexity is real. It's people that are at the regional level, but it's also at the local level. We are operating in more than 150 countries globally. So it's a very complicated organizational model internally. And even for a single platform, obviously you need to solve for these challenges, but then when you introduce a new platform and your tech stack on top of other platforms that we are using and some of those are legacy platforms we just need to deal with.

So we don't necessarily have the latest and most modern tech stack, unfortunately. So it's a mix of new tools that are more cutting edge as well as legacy tools with a lot of limitations. So integration with those other tools that are core to our tech stack and just integration of the data and processes, that's a nightmare. It's a nightmare from a technical implementation perspective, and in terms of compatibility, and usually in terms of customer service because each kind of solution provider is very interested in selling you the platform.

So you get great support until the point of sale and then after, especially when it comes to implementation and challenges we have post-purchase, we get minimal to no support. And they don't understand because again, in some cases, some of these could be legacy tools and they don't have the right people. We don't have the right people on our end to understand their technology.

So the implementation challenges post-purchase are real. So I think from a functionality perspective, the digital asset management platforms are not necessarily the most technically complicated platforms. There's more complicated platforms that we are using in CRM and marketing automation. But integration of that platform with all the other platforms that we are using and data hygiene and integration are the biggest problems that I can think of.

**Tegus Client**
That makes sense. Could you detail the major tools that you're using in the space, different platforms and just pieces of the technology you're using?

**Global Marketing Director, Rapid Diagnostics at Abbott**
Marketing automation is a big one. So we are using Marketo. In most of our divisions, we use Act-On and a couple of others. In my new division, we're using Act-On. There's Salesforce for CRM. So those are the two big ones that are really more focused on the end customer and just commercially oriented platforms that we have, which is what I would bucket as the most strategic ones for our business.

We do have Veeva for approvals, content approval, and we started using Veeva for digital asset management as well. We had a custom-built legacy platform prior to Veeva and it's migrating to Veeva over the last year or so.

Other than that, we have a couple of other platforms. One on sales enablement. It's a custom-built platform called vablet we've been experimenting with. And there's a whole argument around consolidation. Do you go to a one-stop shop like Salesforce and actually start using their marketing automation platform, their sales enablement platform?

So the tech stack might change and we might consolidate further, but I don't think there is one platform that can do it all well in terms of the capability. So it might be a great platform. It's a CRM platform that has a lot of limitations on marketing automation or sales enablement.

So we're going to keep it as is for now for those other platforms, including digital asset management, marketing automation, and sales enablement. So those are the big ones that are being more marketing and commercially oriented. Of course, we have other platforms that we're using in the back end for customer service and other things, but those are more operational in nature versus commercial.

**Tegus Client**
Makes sense. So did your organization decide to go with Veeva because of a centralized digital procurement office? Or was it your team decided to go with it? How was the decision made to go with Veeva?

**Global Marketing Director, Rapid Diagnostics at Abbott**
Yes, the million dollar question on how the enterprises make decisions. So it was a mix. And our decision-making process is evolving as well, I have to say. In the past, it has been completely decentralized. Abbott has eight different divisions, so each division, even each region within the division, so between the global and regional teams, they had the full autonomy to do whatever. Which, of course, is a terrible idea.

So that's one end of the spectrum and then the pendulum started swinging to the other end in terms of, can we really, truly consolidate? So we started looking at it more at the macro level than the corporate level. And they didn't necessarily dictate a single solution, but the corporate team has done an assessment on the user needs.

So each division has to define their business needs, user needs, in terms of what they're trying to solve. And as you can imagine, there are a lot of similarities. There are still some differences. We have some divisions that are more consumer oriented and some that are more B2B.

So there are some nuances in terms of the needs and the requirements. But there's definitely a lot more similarity. So based on that, maybe we'll short list those vendors that qualify. And we've done capability reviews with each of them and then had further discussions in terms of implementation.

So what ended up happening is a lot of our B2B divisions right now are using Veeva and B2C divisions have different solutions, a couple of other ones. I'm not fully aware of exactly what each division is using, but I know there are two or three different ones that are still in the broader Abbott portfolio.

**Tegus Client**
That makes sense. So Veeva was already being used in different parts of the organization, and that was a big selling point for going Veeva for these areas as well?

**Global Marketing Director, Rapid Diagnostics at Abbott**
Well, I think there's only one or two divisions actually. It wasn't the prominent choice. But I think in terms of the process, they follow the right process in terms of instead of discussing the platform, they ask each group to define their requirements and then they assess the requirements against the capabilities of two or three different platforms, including Veeva. I mean it just became obvious that Veeva was meeting most of our needs, especially in the B2B division.

So it just helped the decision-makers because there's more than one. Yes, you need procurement to approve,

but you still need the business units to pay for it. So there has to be a mutual agreement on the platform. So that's how they reach the mutual agreement that's between the business decision makers as well as the procurement team.

**Tegus Client**
That makes sense. So I guess if you look at the whole process from, hey, we're considering a new vendor to when you actually selected Veeva, how long does that process take approximately? So from the point when you were like, hey, we're going to consider a new tech solution in the digital asset management approvals, was that a six month process to when you finally officially selected Veeva? Was that a 12-month process? How long does it take?

**Global Marketing Director, Rapid Diagnostics at Abbott**
Definitely closer to 12 months plus/minus. It could be even more than 12 months, actually. But I think part of it is that the time was lost in redefining the decision-making process. It wasn't necessarily only on platform decision and assessment.

This happened to be at the time where we were redefining how we make decisions going back to my earlier point on, is this completely decentralized at the divisional and regional level? Or do we want to govern it more centrally? So this happens to be my first project that we attacked as part of a more centralized decision-making process.

So there was a lot of time lost initially in defining that governance model in terms of, how are we going to even make the decision, and once that process was more established, the user requirement mapping and just evaluation was definitely less than a year. But the total end-to-end was more than 12 months just because we lost time in the beginning, defining a process for decision-making.

**Tegus Client**
That makes sense. If you look at your whole tech stack, I mean, you've hit on a couple of things here, but what are the things overall that work well and what are the things that could be improved?

**Global Marketing Director, Rapid Diagnostics at Abbott**
So I think we got to a point where we have more best of breed. It's not completely out of the box, but it's really more universal solutions versus the custom-built solutions that we used to have. So that's definitely a big area of improvement because when you have custom-built solutions, of course, integration becomes even more challenging and you cannot scale those platforms in an enterprise setting.

So that's definitely a big win. The governance of those platforms within regional, global, and local teams are a lot better defined currently because even after again, you have access to the platform, there's a lot of nuances on user access, how many admins, how many super admins you are going to have, who is going to be able to do what in that platform. Especially if you're handling data, if you're handling content in our role in health care and medical device, pharma, things can go wrong and there's consequences of putting an asset out there that's not approved by the right people and we have those situations.

There's consequences of actually handling the customer data in the wrong way or not being able to actually report on some of these privacy requirements that are now in place with GDPR and CCPA and there's serious consequences of not getting the governance model right and well documented.

So that's in a much better place right now. In terms of where we can do better is, again, I think it's the integration and just really making sure there's continuity, especially from a data perspective between one platform to another. From a process perspective, you still need to take the asset that's approved in Veeva and put it into our sales enablement platform, which is a separate platform right now.

And again, things can still go wrong because it's not an automated process. There's still manual steps in there in terms of how we actually push the content end-to-end internally. So that's an area that we continue to focus on.

But again, going back to my earlier point, there's not necessarily a one-stop shop. Even with the large

providers, they don't have all the solutions that they need end to end or, even if they had a solution, it's not necessarily meeting our requirements. So we're going to continue to use different platforms from different providers. We just need to make sure, again, there are those manual touch points or handovers between one platform to another. The process is bulletproof in terms of making sure the risk is all documented and there's a mitigation plan for the risks that we are taking.

**Tegus Client**
That makes sense. Do you think that the trend is towards fewer apps now? Or is it just more towards non-custom-built apps that are more products rather than a custom build? Do you feel your whole tech stack is growing right now? Or do you think you're starting to shrink it?

**Global Marketing Director, Rapid Diagnostics at Abbott**
I mean, it's yes and no, so what I mean by that is each health care company, and even this is beyond health care, is on a journey in terms of digital maturity. They're going to need access to new tools and platforms. Marketing automation, for instance, wasn't even a thing until five to 10 years ago.

So there's still a lot of companies who are not using it properly. So I think there's definitely a trend towards digitization and that comes with taking and onboarding new tools in the tech stack. But I think where the companies have a lot less appetite is for a given established capability.

For instance, again, marketing automation is now hitting that point where it's a more mature category from a tech stack perspective. A lot of companies have it and it's to the point that, again, in some cases, within the same company in each division, they're using a different one in each region.

They are using a different one. That's where there's a lot less appetite, why do we have 16 different platforms that are actually doing the same thing, that's not necessarily helping us leverage our buying power. We're not getting the best price from the vendors plus, again, these platforms now have very similar capabilities.

So as the technologies mature and, again, companies adopt it, there's definitely a lot less appetite for the variation and the proliferation of tools. But I mean we're still going to have more net new tools in our tech stack just because we're trying to increase our maturity in terms of digital excellence.

So right now, I mean we are looking into new things in terms of how we can do more real-time data sharing and AR and VR integration, in some cases, like medical training and other things. So there's always going to be buckets like net new capabilities, new platforms we're going to need to continue to excel in digital marketing maturity. But again, there's definitely a lot less appetite for having multiple tools that do the same thing.

So if there's no real value and, that is, benefit if it's not a cutting-edge tool and there's no additional value that platform is bringing to the table, it's like we have multiple ones just because there's different decision-makers in the company with different perceptions. That's where I think procurement gets more involved for the right reasons, and they're trying to look for opportunities in terms of optimizing the investment.

**Tegus Client**
Makes sense. So I understand the challenge in this decentralized divisional organization where there could be different vendors or different tools used in different divisions. Is it a procurement responsibility to say, "Hey, can we decide on which tool we want to use across the divisions?" I mean is that something that Abbott would do? Or is it really a divisional thing and they're not willing to go there?

**Global Marketing Director, Rapid Diagnostics at Abbott**
I mean yes and no or neither/nor is the answer to the question. There's a role for procurement, especially for a very large organization like Abbott. I think, for a lot of industries, given the recession-like economic pressure, there's always pressure on bottom line.

And that translates into scrutiny on your marketing and commercial spend. And when you look at how that's

structured, these platforms, the cost of these platforms add up. So when you look at it from a macro perspective, the procurement teams are looking at it and asking the question on, can we justify differentiation at the divisional and regional level?

In some cases, we can make that business case and each company is run differently. But in our world, there's a lot of power given to the divisions. That's how the company actually mitigates the risk and company survived over the course of 130-plus years and thrived because we don't put all our eggs in one basket in terms of the division and the category.

We have a nutrition business, which is consumer oriented. We have diagnostics. We have medical devices. We have established pharmaceuticals. So it's a very wide spectrum. It's a very different customer base, different products, different gross market models.

So that decentralization in terms of the decision-making is actually helping the organization strategy. But again, within that, if you define your business requirements and user requirements very clearly, you see that there's actually more similarities than differences when it comes to marketing technology.

Because again, you can do that and say, okay, of course, we need different products for instance, the selling. You're not going to go and sell the same product through the cardiovascular division and then through the diagnostics division. You need different R&D teams for different things. There's a lot of areas, that's decentralization and differentiation.

But for marketing technology, again, the end customer. The name of the customer might be different, but the business needs and user needs are actually very similar, at least between B2B and B2C. So when you do that, I think you find that right balance between can we actually look at a model where we are a little bit more consolidated and you still need to create a win-win.

There's a win for the procurement team because they're actually, of course, helping facilitate the process and doing their jobs honestly, but it's also a win for the business leads because they're potentially getting a better deal, better price for the same technology or even a better technology in some cases.

There's been a lot of cases where some of the divisions were upgraded to a new platform with better capabilities at a lower cost. So you can definitely create a win-win. It doesn't have to be the top-down, forced approach in terms of everyone needs to use a single platform.

You're never going to be that single force model, but I think the other end of the spectrum is also not healthy, where each division is making their own choices in terms of what they're supposed to be using.

And they don't have the technical expertise, honestly, to be able to evaluate some of these platforms because they're relatively new and they don't have the right people internally to evaluate, but procurement team has a lot more expertise in terms of evaluating different options.

**Tegus Client**
Right. So I understand that you use Veeva for the primary work of the copy approval, promotional review activities, and for the digital asset management, library, and repository for what goes through that. And I know that you've talked about the challenges with integration. Is it primarily in and around Veeva where you're seeing those integration challenges?

**Global Marketing Director, Rapid Diagnostics at Abbott**
For sure, across all areas. There's probably even bigger challenges between our marketing automation and CRM platforms, which are Marketo and Salesforce. So it's across the board for sure. With Veeva, we're handling a lot less data. We're not handling customer data, it's essentially content management, approval, and asset management.

So there's a lot less concern in terms of privacy and data integrity. But still, going back to my earlier point, if you deploy a tool that's not approved by the right people into one platform to another, so take it from Veeva and just put it in our sales enablement platform, which is a separate platform currently that's custom built, that's the compliance risk. And that's a very big risk we are taking. So that integration is critical in our case.

And right now, it's a manual process. We're looking at ways where it could be automated. So it's still a concern for Veeva but not only unique to Veeva.

**Tegus Client**
Right. I'm assuming that your Veeva environment is a validated platform?

**Global Marketing Director, Rapid Diagnostics at Abbott**
Yes.

**Tegus Client**
Okay. Just out of curiosity, about how many copy approval submissions are normally done in your organization? Per day? Per month?

**Global Marketing Director, Rapid Diagnostics at Abbott**
And when you say copy approval, are you literally referring to pieces of assets? Because sometimes it's the same content, copy might be updated multiple times. So just the transaction, the touch points are probably 100,000s honestly. But when you look at the number of assets we produce annually, it's about 1,000. So it's two or three on average per day.

**Tegus Client**
Okay. And how many products does that process cover?

**Global Marketing Director, Rapid Diagnostics at Abbott**
About 400 or so products. Again, they're not all created the same in size. I mean 80% of our revenue is coming from 20 products, but we have a very long tail of ancillary products or regional or local spend, that's the complexity of a very large organization with a very strong global footprint.

There are some products we only sell in Vietnam. We can't ignore that. We need still a tool, an asset, that speaks to that specific product that is only sold in Vietnam. But from a revenue perspective, it's, of course, peanuts compared to the other products we have in the portfolio.

**Tegus Client**
And I'm assuming that in Veeva, in the copy approval process, they're dealing with standard file types like Word documents, PDFs, PowerPoints, certain video material. Are you starting to see any new file types having to do with virtual reality or anything that isn't used yet?

**Global Marketing Director, Rapid Diagnostics at Abbott**
Video was cutting edge for us, honestly. We used this platform that was horrific, it was taking hours for them to upload and review video content. So that was a big step forward with Veeva, part of the main reasons why we actually considered even changing platform, honestly.

Because the people are so used to the legacy platform. It wasn't perfect, but onboarding any platform also means you need to retrain everyone. There's compliance risk and everything. But it was horrific for image and video approvals specifically. So even video was a big step forward with Veeva.

So we don't have any other major cutting-edge tools. We have a couple executions in markets that are leveraging more cutting-edge tools like VR, AR, for instance, but those are currently approved outside of the system. And because the use case is very limited, and the approvers are just governing those very closely manually right now, which is not sustainable long term, but it's just because we are experimenting with some of those tools that we can justify not putting them through the mainstream tool yet.

**Tegus Client**
And remind me because we've seen how Veeva works. It seems to me that they really aren't that strong in the type of collaboration functionality that might work a little better in a broad organization where multiple

people can be working on the same asset at the same time?

**Global Marketing Director, Rapid Diagnostics at Abbott**
Yes, it could be better. But just again, maybe it's because our benchmark is still low. Our previous tool was horrific. It was slightly better than a manual paper approval, honestly. That's a lot of people just focused on the positives of Veeva versus some of those collaboration challenges. It can make it better. But honestly, right now, it's not necessarily a must-have requirement. It's very nice to have, but it's not a must-have requirement for us.

**Tegus Client**
Right. And it's certainly better than what you had before.

**Global Marketing Director, Rapid Diagnostics at Abbott**
Oh yes, exactly. I think it's on your comparison stage. If I'm answering in two years, if we were to have this conversation again, I'll tell you, okay, yes absolutely this needs to be changed. Right now, a lot of people internally are feeling like we jumped years ahead with Veeva. So they are not necessarily very concerned with some of those limitations.

**Tegus Client**
Right. I also understand that with Veeva it's up to, and I don't know what role you call the person that is submitting the asset, but it's up to the submitter or maybe in a moderator role to identify who all the reviewers are that need to participate in the review of a particular asset.

**Global Marketing Director, Rapid Diagnostics at Abbott**
That's one area that's a great idea for all other industries. In health care, it can go wrong in so many ways. And that's where we actually had to educate the customer team in Veeva and just took them down and helped them appreciate some of these nuances that are unique to health care because, again, it's a pure compliance risk, a product manager can only decide.

There is a bare minimum that needs to be fixed and baked into the process and non-negotiable, which is so hard for them to appreciate and customize the tool to fit the need because it's unique because they're trying to give a lot of power to the end user, the content approver, the content owner in this case, which is very interesting if you're talking about any other industry, maybe that's not regulated specifically.

In our world, if the product manager has the option to deselect a regulatory person in the approval process, which right now, you're trying to bypass that because there's at least one person in the approval left, who is just policing the list of approvers to see if the content owner is doing it right.

But that means additional burden on one of the approvers, which is completely against the idea in terms of creating that efficiency through a better platform. So that's definitely one shortcoming that actually got us in trouble even after the implementation, and we had to work with them and are still working with them, honestly, on finalizing that workflow so that it's aligned to our business needs.

**Tegus Client**
Right. So a product where that type of review or assignment was automated by the system and made sure that all the required reviewers based on the product criteria were automatically assigned and got their tasks, that would be a good thing.

**Global Marketing Director, Rapid Diagnostics at Abbott**
Yes, exactly.

**Tegus Client**
Okay. Do you have any responsibility in the development of your annual medical planning strategy that goes on that talks about, we've got these products, this is how we want to get them launched, this is from

beginning to end how we're going to be dealing with that? Does that still fall into your responsibilities at all?

**Global Marketing Director, Rapid Diagnostics at Abbott**
Are we talking about the product stage-gate process? Is it the launch planning process?

**Tegus Client**
Yes, exactly.

**Global Marketing Director, Rapid Diagnostics at Abbott**
Yes, we have a PMO office, which is a program management office that is the process owner. But then from a marketing perspective, you have specific leads that get them all through different stages. So there's an upstream marketing team that gets involved with initial user needs identification and technical product definition and then my team gets involved when it gets closer to commercialization.

**Tegus Client**
Okay. So you don't necessarily get involved with the laying out of what clinical trials may be necessary in the tracking of those.

**Global Marketing Director, Rapid Diagnostics at Abbott**
No, my team doesn't get involved with that.

**Tegus Client**
Okay. So a particular digital asset goes through Veeva, gets approved, goes into the digital asset library. And then I'm assuming that there are some aspects of that which also need to get into your marketing automation platform?

**Global Marketing Director, Rapid Diagnostics at Abbott**
Okay. Yes, we're using Marketo in some divisions and then Act-On in some others. So yes, if it's specific tools or tactics that are direct to end user like e-mail program, that's our database, for instance, it goes into our marketing automation platform.

So how it works is when an asset is approved in Veeva, it gets a specific code designation in terms of the approval code. And then the marketing automation platform uses that unique code as we grade the assets within the marketing automation platform. So we make sure there's a "pulling" from the approved resources.

So right now, Veeva is not integrated to the marketing automation platform natively, but there's plans for us to integrate that in the future. Right now, it's more like coordination, integration is not the right word. But again, we are using those unique approval codes to make sure the content that's actually published through our marketing automation tool is actually the approved content through Veeva.

**Tegus Client**
Yes. Are there any other topics or questions you want to discuss or things we should have asked?

**Global Marketing Director, Rapid Diagnostics at Abbott**
Yes. The service piece is an important element. I think you are trying to understand the pain points and the decision-making process up until the purchase, which is very important. But what I can tell you in terms of the user experience and the customer experiences, I have yet to see a company that can do as great a job in the post-sale process as they do in the presale.

The companies need, especially in large enterprise settings, a lot more support post-implementation, even during implementation post-sale. And a lot of these companies really significantly lack either expertise or commitment or they actually up-charge for those services.

But in some cases, of course, they have the customer success teams, but their goals are defined around

selling tools versus supporting the implementation because they're not necessarily monetizing. So they don't knock on our doors until the contract is up the following year.

So that's very frustrating, especially in the initial years. So I think these companies should really think about their service model and support model that they have post-sale to ensure retention of the customers, especially enterprise customers that they have. From a functional, technical capabilities perspective, for instance, Marketo is a great, amazing product.

Salesforce is a great product for CRM, but their customer service and support is horrific. And we are one of their biggest clients. So it's not that we are very small and they don't care. We are very big. But the way their incentives are working is really very focused on sales versus customer experience if that makes sense.

And then if you tell them, we're going to pull the plug on the contract or we are considering another vendor, that's when they start negotiating on the price. Yes, pricing is important, but customer experience is equally important.

So it gets to the point sometimes that you're willing to pay the same or more for another solution that might not be as competent from a technical perspective but provides much better service because not all companies have the luxury to have these internal resources to actually carry through the implementation, help solve the problems post-implementation that you need to continue that partnership beyond the point of sale. So I think that's another important area to understand and explore for these solution providers.
