## Slide 4: Healthcare's Missing Link
# Healthcare's Missing Link

### The Missing Link
*   Healthcare has digitized storage (EHRs, claims, labs).
*   The industry is investing in analytics (AI, insights).
*   But identified data access & movement is broken and trapped in silos, faxes, and manual workflows

**Data Silos → ? → Analytics**

### The Solution
*   Hermes is building the rails for identified health data movement and access.
    *   Visa for payments
    *   Plaid for banking
    *   Twilio for communications.

## Slide 7: Hermes Health – Contrarian Views
# Hermes Health – Contrarian Views

### Contrarian Views
*   Neutrality is the MOAT. Neutrality is our Superpower.
*   Fragmentation is the opportunity, not a barrier.
*   Scale comes through intermediaries, not end-customers.
*   Network effects matter more than proprietary tech.
*   Identified data is a bigger market than de-identified data.

*(Image depicts two cartoon figures, one on the left with multiple arms/heads pointing left, and another winged figure on the right pointing right, both inside speech bubbles with arrows indicating directions.)*

The market obsessed with data ownership and closed ecosystems, Hermes Health's neutrality and infrastructure-first approach make it the only player positioned to become indispensable middleware—the “Stripe” or “Plaid” of identified patient health data.

## Slide 21: Hidden Doors Exist in Healthcare
# Hidden Doors Exist in Healthcare

### Hidden Doors Exist in Healthcare
*   Hospitals / Clinics are not the sole custodians of a patient health data.
*   Other Custodians include:
    *   Release of Information (ROI) Vendors
    *   Electronic Health Record (EHR) Vendors
    *   Claims Clearinghouses
    *   Imaging Software
    *   Regional Health Information Exchanges

*(Image depicts a long corridor with multiple arched, closed wooden doors on the right side, suggesting many access points.)*

## Slide 22: Hermes Finds and Unlocks these Hidden Doors
# Hermes Finds and Unlocks these Hidden Doors

### Unlock and Integrate with Partners
Hermes Health finds and integrates with Partners to unlock these hidden doors enabling Requestors to access them.

All records are requested and delivered through the Hermes Data Network — one centralized platform—abstracting complexity out of the process.

### Value of Integration to Partners
*   **New Revenue:** Monetize their access to data through a new customer segment.
*   **Less Overhead:** Reduced administrative burden servicing medical record requests.
*   **Trust:** Integrate without exposing proprietary data like contract terms, routing logic, or site directories to competitors.

*(Image depicts a long corridor with multiple arched, open doors on the right side. Beyond the open doors is a vibrant, colorful landscape with trees, flowers, and a winding path, implying access to new opportunities.)*

## Slide 23: Hermes Data Network
# Hermes Data Network

### The Center - Hermes Middleware
*   **Simplified Network:** Hermes Health Integrates with Partners to create a simple layer for Requestors to request and receive medical records.
*   **Centralized Analytics:** Streamline data tracking and reporting for both Requestors and Partners.

### Value of Being the Center
*   **Offer New Services:** Centralized control creates opportunities to offer additional services to both Requestors and Partners.

*(Diagram shows four "Requestor" boxes at the top, all sending requests to a central "Hermes - Middleware" box. From "Hermes - Middleware", requests are distributed to "ROI Vendors", "Claims", "EHR", and "Facilities" boxes.)*

23

## Slide 24: Partners Can't Be The Center
# Partners Can't Be The Center

### Why Can't Partners Be The Center
*   **Competitive Conflict:** Partners compete with each other, making it difficult for any single partner to act as a neutral hub for all.
*   **Limited Footprint:** Individual partners have a limited footprint on a patient data record. As a result they cannot fulfill all requests.
*   **Trust:** Partners don't trust each other and as a result hesitate to share proprietary information directly with each other, restricting cooperation.
*   **Complex Integration:** Direct connections among multiple partners create costly complexity, duplication, and labor.

*(Image depicts a group of six stern-faced, serious-looking individuals, emphasizing conflict or distrust.)*

## Slide 25: Flywheel and Moat
# Flywheel and Moat

### Two-Sided Marketplace
Hermes Health connects Requestors with Partners creating value for both sides:

*   **Partners Benefit Via:**
    *   Increased Requests from Requestors increases Vendors revenue.
    *   Reduced fulfillment costs by switching Requestors to electronic submission and delivery
*   **Requestors Benefit Via:**
    *   Simplified record submission and delivery increasing, enabling increased demand for more requests
    *   Improved turnaround times

*(Flywheel Diagram)*

| Element                    |
| :------------------------- |

# Step 1: HIPAA Checker

### Problem: Incomplete HIPAA Authorizations
*   Customer-submitted HIPAA Authorizations are frequently missing key elements required by providers.
*   These deficiencies lead to denials — wasting time and money, with feedback loops often exceeding 20 days.

### Solution: HIPAA Auth Checker
*   Automatically reviews HIPAA Authorizations for 10 compliance gaps.
*   Flags missing or invalid components and suggests precise corrections to ensure provider acceptance.

# Step 2: Site Sonar

### Problem: Bad Site Information
*   Patients often cannot recall or accurately name the site details where they received care
*   Medical canvassing is time-consuming and expensive.

### Solution: Site Sonar
*   Site Sonar uses a patient's PII and our Partner Network to automatically find care sites a patient has visited. Output includes:
    *   Facility Name
    *   Address
    *   Speciality
    *   Date

| Name ↓↑                      | Earliest Service Date | Address                              | Specialty          |

# Step 3: Site Finder

### Problem: Messy Facility Data
*   Customer-submitted facility details are messy and inconsistent
*   Manually identifying the correct metadata such as release of information vendor, location, fax, ect

### Solution: Site Finder
*   Automatically cleans and standardizes facility address
*   Cross-references with Hermes national Site List. If matched, intelligently outputs the corresponding site meta data:
    *   Release of information vendor
    *   Fax
    *   ect.....

**Match Reason:**
Both facilities are located at 1203 S. Tyler St., Covington, LA 70433, and are associated with Ochsner Health. The first facility is listed as "Ochsner Health 1203 S Tyler St, Covington, LA 70433, USA," which corresponds to the address of Ochsner Health Center - South Tyler. ([ochsner.org](https://www.ochsner.org/locations/ochsner-health-center-south-tyler/?utm_source=openai)) The second facility, "Ochsner Health System (#157) NSRC Ochsner Health Center - South Tyler (#390) 1203 S Tyler St, Covington, LA 70433, USA," also matches this address and includes identifiers (#157) and (#390) that likely refer to internal designations within the Ochsner Health System. Given the identical addresses and association with Ochsner Health, it is highly likely that both facilities belong to the same health system.

# Step 4: Smart Router

### Problem: Submission Disparity
*   Submitting records through the optimal submission path is complex:
    *   Fax
    *   ROI specific vendor portal
    *   Bespoke Integration

### Solution: Smart Router
*   Hermes Health submits the record request on behalf of the customer by:
    *   Routing directly to its ROI Partners
    *   Faxing validated facilities using our efax service

## Slide 38: Step 5: OCR & Text Extraction
# Step 5: OCR & Text Extraction

### Problem: Image Based Document
*   Sites often send documents back that are scanned image of text documents
*   These documents are thus hard to work with since they are not text based document

### Solution: Text Extraction & OCR
*   **Text Extraction:** Extracts the raw text from the document allowing you to work with the underlying raw text.
*   **OCR:** Convert the image document into a text based PDF. It superimposes invisible ink over the tex making it searchable.

*(Image is a page from "A MAD TEA-PARTY." from Alice in Wonderland, showing an illustration and text, with some words highlighted in yellow like "Why is a raven like a writing-desk?")*

The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on
hearing this; but all he said was, "Why is a
raven like a writing-desk?"
"Come, we shall have some fun now!"
thought Alice. "I'm glad they've begun ask-
ing riddles -I believe I can guess that," she
added aloud.
"Do you mean that you think you can find
out the answer to it?" said the March Hare.
"Exactly so," said Alice.

# Simple Contractual Framework

### Contracting & Liability
Hermes signs agreements with both the Requestor and the Partner.

*   **Requestors** attest that HIPAA Authorization submissions are valid and accurate.
*   **Partners** attest:
    *   That they have the right to release identified medical data assuming a valid HIPAA Authorization.
    *   That they are releasing the correct data for the patient requested
*   **Hermes Health** attests that patient data is securely handled and transmitted to the appropriate party.

| Party           | Attestation                                      | Liability                                   |
| :-------------- | :----------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| Requestor       | Attest that HIPAA Authorizations are Valid and Accurate | Holds the Liability for Inappropriate Record Submissions |
| Hermes Health   | Attest that Patient Data is Secured and transmitted to the appropriate party | Holds the Liability for Inappropriate Record Disclosures |
| Partner         | Attest that Records released are for the patient requested | Holds the Liability for Inappropriate Disclosure |

## Slide 41: Solution: How it Works
# Solution: How it Works

### First Neutral API for Identified Health Data
The Hermes Health Unity Platform connects Requestors to a growing network of Partners—including ROI vendors, EHR systems, and RWD providers. How it works:

*   **Secure Intake:** Requestors securely submit patient's full name, date of birth, and a signed HIPAA Authorization form.
*   **Smart Routing:** The Unity Platform then routes these requests to our network of Partners.
*   **Partner Fulfillment:** Our Partner networks processes these Requests and securely transmits identified patient data back to the Unity Platform.
*   **Delivery:** The Unity Platform securely delivers the data back to requestors without revealing Partner-specific infrastructure or exposing individual Partner details, protecting privacy, and confidentiality
*   **Transparent Pricing:** Each Partner is paid a clear, per-record/patient fee to keep pricing simple and aligned.
