### Company Update & Pivot

- Shifted from standard biomarker testing to at-home multi-omic testing
	- Previous model: $50 profit on $300 biomarker test, no economies of scale
	- New approach: at-home multi-omic test with finger prick/capillary blood
	- Adding proteomics, metabolomics, lipidemics with mass spec device
- Technology advantages
	- Capillary blood has lower nerve density than finger prick
	- All studies on finger prick/capillary blood show positive results
	- Enables D2C opportunities and user-generated content

### Go-to-Market Strategy

- Longevity clinics and Continuing Care Retirement Communities (CRCs)
	- Pilot with 1 CCRC covering 4,000 elderly patients (pre-comorbidity)
	- 3-5 year contracts as annual health provider
	- Also offering genomics through platform
- Current traction
	- Signed first $1M ARR with Dr. Khan (runs 4 clinics globally)
	- Dr. Khan has distribution to 300 other clinics
	- Selling organ clocks at $500 (vs $5,000 from competitors like Sevacscan)
	- 50% margins at current scale
- Value proposition for clinics
	- Efficacy measurement for $10-20K interventions (stem cell therapy)
	- Early Alzheimer’s risk detection (hazard ratio 3.1)
	- Keep CCRC residents in independent living longer (higher profit margins)

### Technical Development & Fundraising

- AI model development
	- Using UK Biobank data (50,000+ people, longitudinal subset)
	- Building foundation model similar to Tesla self-driving approach
	- Graph transformer with protein embeddings representing biological pathways
	- Hiring talent from Tempest, Flatiron, Path AI for clinical diagnostics
- Funding plans
	- Raising $4-6M in January 2026
	- Seeking 3 investor types: healthcare/diagnostics, biotech, smart generalists
	- Previous investor did small pre-seed in August
- Consumer strategy (future)
	- “1,000 biomarkers at home” positioning vs competitors’ 150 biomarkers
	- Waiting to perfect at-home test design and regulatory pathway

### Next Steps

- Pranav to send relevant research papers for review
- Virtue to review materials and provide feedback
- Expand CCRC pilot from pilot to all 4,000 patients
- Scale longevity clinics from 4 to 20 to 100 locations
