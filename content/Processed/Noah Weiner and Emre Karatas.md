### Noah’s Background & Previous Company

- Parents involved in public health research at Hopkins
	- Father created Hopkins ACGs (still professor of health policy)
	- Mother has MPH from Hopkins
- Built clinical decision support engine at previous company (Afana)
	- Integrated with Epic, AllScripts, Athena Health
	- Deployed to 180 health systems (Advent, Steward, Summit)
	- One of only 2 vendors with CDS hooks access to Athena
	- System only used 25% of the time by providers (highest performing guideline: BRS criteria)
- Sold company to Amalgam Rx for $22M
	- Pre-acquisition: encounter-focused
	- Post-acquisition: population health programs
	- 80% of people opened outbound messages for at-home testing kits
	- 35% requested at-home kit after outreach

### Robinhood Health Overview

- $150K angel round at start of year to pursue full-time
- Originally started with employer space, pivoted to Medicaid market
- Considered incubating through Redesign (6-week sprint process) but opted out
	- Legal team advised it wouldn’t significantly extend runway
- Building virtual medical group targeting quality improvement using at-home kits
- Partnership with LabCorp for cost-effective testing
	- FIT kits: $16 each vs $625 for Cologuard through insurance
	- Available tests: colorectal (FIT), HbA1C, kidney, cervical cancer

### Go-to-Market Strategy

- Long-term target: Medicaid managed care plans
- Current approach: Build efficacy data through FQHC partnerships first
- Health Choice Network partnership
	- MSO representing ~80 FQHCs
	- Innovation partnership to roll out care model
	- Joint targeting of managed care plans once clinical data established
- Working on deal with competitor representing ~40 FQHCs
- Total addressable: ~120 FQHCs to prove model

### Key Business Model Elements

- End-to-end system: identification, outreach, result management, follow-up
- Big uncertainty around kit return rates
	- UCLA study showed 17-26% return rate (commercial population)
	- Medicaid population expected to have more challenges
- Fully at-risk model from day one
	- No fee-for-service approach
	- Success-based compensation tied to closing gaps of care
- Built own EMR on Healthy platform
	- Pulls patient data from Epic
	- Automated gaps of care analysis
	- Integrated email/text outreach and CRM

### Fundraising & Next Steps

- Target raise: $1-3M (letting market dictate amount)
- Patient capital approach - avoid 24-36 month fundraising cycles
- Judy Faulkner’s advice: “Grow slowly and carefully, do good job, grow by referrals”
- Virtue fit assessment
	- CAC, attribution, ARPU, 50% care margins framework
	- Need to prove kit return rates and MCO contract viability
- Timeline: Deck completion by end of week, follow-up Wednesday
