“When did you feel the AGI?”

This is a question that has been floating around AI circles for a while, and it’s a hard one to answer for two reasons. First, what is AGI, and second, “feel” is a bit like obscenity: as Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart famously said in [Jacobellis v. Ohio](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/378/184/), “I know it when I see it.”

I gave my definition of AGI in [AI’s Uneven Arrival](https://stratechery.com/2025/ais-uneven-arrival/):

> What o3 and inference-time scaling point to is something different: AI’s that can actually be given tasks and trusted to complete them. This, by extension, looks a lot more like an independent worker than an assistant — ammunition, rather than a rifle sight. That may seem an odd analogy, but it comes from **[a talk Keith Rabois gave at Stanford](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fQHLK1aIBs)**…My definition of AGI is that it can be ammunition, i.e. it can be given a task and trusted to complete it at a good-enough rate (my definition of Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI) is the ability to come up with the tasks in the first place).

The “feel” part of that question is a more recent discovery: DeepResearch from OpenAI *feels* like AGI; I just got a new employee for the shockingly low price of $200/month.

### Deep Research Bullets

OpenAI announced Deep Research in a [February 2 blog post](https://openai.com/index/introducing-deep-research/):

> Today we’re launching deep research in ChatGPT, a new agentic capability that conducts multi-step research on the internet for complex tasks. It accomplishes in tens of minutes what would take a human many hours.
>
> Deep research is OpenAI’s next agent that can do work for you independently — you give it a prompt, and ChatGPT will find, analyze, and synthesize hundreds of online sources to create a comprehensive report at the level of a research analyst. Powered by a version of the upcoming OpenAI o3 model that’s optimized for web browsing and data analysis, it leverages reasoning to search, interpret, and analyze massive amounts of text, images, and PDFs on the internet, pivoting as needed in reaction to information it encounters.
>
> The ability to synthesize knowledge is a prerequisite for creating new knowledge. For this reason, deep research marks a significant step toward our broader goal of developing AGI, which we have long envisioned as capable of producing novel scientific research.

It’s honestly hard to keep track of OpenAI’s AGI definitions these days — CEO Sam Altman, [just yesterday](https://blog.samaltman.com/three-observations), defined it as “a system that can tackle increasingly complex problems, at human level, in many fields” — but in my rather more modest definition Deep Research sits right in the middle of that excerpt: it synthesizes research in an economically valuable way, but doesn’t create new knowledge.

I already published two examples of Deep Research in [last Tuesday’s Stratechery Update](https://stratechery.com/2025/apple-earnings-openai-deep-research-the-unbundling-of-substantiation/). While I suggest reading the whole thing, to summarize:

* First, I published my (brief) review of [Apples recent earnings](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/01/apple-reports-first-quarter-results/), including three observations:

  + It was notable that Apple earned record revenue even though iPhone sales were down year-over-year, in the latest datapoint about the company’s transformation into a [Services juggernaut](https://stratechery.com/2024/boomer-apple/).
  + China sales were down again, but this wasn’t a new trend: it actually goes back nearly a decade, but you can only see that if you realize how the Huawei chip ban gave Apple a temporary boost in the country.
  + While Apple executives claimed that Apple Intelligence drove iPhone sales, there really wasn’t any evidence in the geographic sales numbers supporting that assertion.
* Second, I published a Deep Research report using a generic prompt:

  `I am Ben Thompson, the author of Stratechery. This is important information because I want you to understand my previous analysis of Apple, and the voice in which I write on Stratechery. I want a research report about Apple's latest earnings in the style and voice of Stratechery that is in line with my previous analysis.`
* Third, I published a Deep Research report using a prompt that incorporated my takeaways from the earnings:

  `I am Ben Thompson, the author of Stratechery. This is important information because I want you to understand my previous analysis of Apple, and the voice in which I write on Stratechery. I want a research report about Apple's latest earnings for fiscal year 2025 q1 (calendar year 2024 q4). There are a couple of angles I am particularly interested in:`

  `- First, there is the overall trend of services revenue carrying the companies earnings. How has that trend continued, what does it mean for margins, etc.`

  `- Second, I am interested in the China angle. My theory is that Apple's recent decline in China is not new, but is actually part of a longer trend going back nearly a decade. I believe that trend was arrested by the chip ban on Huawei, but that that was only a temporary bump in terms of a long-term decline. In addition, I would like to marry this to deeper analysis of the Chinese phone market, the distinction between first tier cities and the rest of China, and what that says about Apple's prospects in the country.`

  `- Third, what takeaways are there about Apple's AI prospects? The company claims that Apple Intelligence is helping sales in markets where it has launched, but isn't this a function of not being available in China?`

  `Please deliver this report in a format and style that is suitable for Stratechery.`

You can [read the Update for the output](https://stratechery.com/2025/apple-earnings-openai-deep-research-the-unbundling-of-substantiation/), but this was my evaluation:

> The first answer was decent given the paucity of instruction; it’s really more of a summary than anything, but there are a few insightful points. The second answer was considerably more impressive. This question relied much more heavily on my previous posts, and weaved points I’ve made in the past into the answer. I don’t, to be honest, think I learned anything new, but I think that anyone encountering this topic for the first time would have. Or, to put it another way, were I looking for a research assistant, I would consider hiring whoever wrote the second answer.

In other words, Deep Research isn’t a rifle barrel, but for this question at least, it was a pretty decent piece of ammunition.

### DeepResearch Examples

Still, that ammunition wasn’t that valuable to me; I read [the transcript of Apple’s earnings call](https://sixcolors.com/post/2025/01/this-is-tim-and-kevan-apples-q1-results-call-transcribed/) before my 8am [Dithering recording](https://dithering.passport.online/member/episode/apple-earnings?guid=https%3A%2F%2Fdithering.passport.online%2Fmember%2Fepisode%2Fapple-earnings) and came up with my three points immediately; that’s the luxury of having thought about and covered Apple for going on twelve years. And, as I noted above, the entire reason that the second Deep Research report was interesting was because I came up with the ideas and [Deep Research substantiated them](https://stratechery.com/2022/the-ai-unbundling/); the substantiation, however, wasn’t nearly to the standard (in my very biased subjective opinion!) of a Stratechery Update.

I found a much more beneficial use case the next day. Before I conduct a Stratechery Interview I do several hours of research on the person I am interviewing, their professional background, the company they work for, etc.; in this case I was talking to Bill McDermott, the Chairman and CEO of ServiceNow, a company I am somewhat familiar with but not intimately so. So, I asked Deep Research for help:

`I am going to conduct an interview with Bill McDermott, the CEO of ServiceNow, and I need to do research about both McDermott and ServiceNow to prepare my questions.`

`First, I want to know more about McDermott and his background. Ideally there are some good profiles of him I can read. I know he used to work at SAP and I would like to know what is relevant about his experience there. Also, how and why did he take the ServiceNow job?`

`Then, what is the background of ServiceNow? How did it get started? What was its initial product-market fit, and how has it expanded over time? What kind of companies use ServiceNow?`

`What is the ServiceNow business model? What is its go-to-market strategy?`

`McDermott wants to talk about ServiceNow's opportunities in AI. What are those opportunities, and how are they meaningfully unique, or different from simple automation?`

`What do users think of ServiceNow? Is it very ugly and hard to use? Why is it very sticky? What attracts companies to it?`

`What competitors does ServiceNow have? Can it be a platform for other companies? Or is there an opportunity to disrupt ServiceNow?`

`What other questions do you have that would be useful for me to ask?`

`You can use previous Stratechery Interviews as a resource to understand the kinds of questions I typically ask.`

I found [the results](https://chatgpt.com/share/67a231d2-49c4-8011-a18f-751e435a9820) eminently useful, although the questions were pretty mid; I did spend some time doing some additional reading of things like earnings reports before [conducting the Interview](https://stratechery.com/2025/an-interview-with-servicenow-ceo-bill-mcdermott-about-enterprise-ai-agents/) with my own questions. In short, it saved me a fair bit of time and gave me a place to start from, and that alone more than paid for my monthly subscription.

Another compelling example came in researching a friend’s complicated medical issue; I’m not going to share my prompt and results for obvious reasons. What I will note is that this friend has been struggling with this issue for over a year, and has seen multiple doctors and tried several different remedies. Deep Research identified a possible issue in ten minutes that my friend has only just learned about from a specialist last week; while it is still to be determined if this is the answer he is looking for, it is notable that Deep Research may have accomplished in ten minutes what has taken my friend many hours over many months with many medical professionals.

It is the final example, however, that is the most interesting, precisely because it is the question on which Deep Research most egregiously failed. I generated a report about another friend’s industry, asking for the major players, supply chain analysis, customer segments, etc. It was by far my most comprehensive and detailed prompt. And, sure enough, Deep Research came back with a fully fleshed out report answering all of my questions.

It was also completely wrong, but in a really surprising way. The best way to characterize the issue is to go back to that famous Donald Rumsfeld quote:

> There are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns — the ones we don’t know we don’t know.

The issue with the report I generated — and once again, I’m not going to share the results, but this time for reasons that are non-obvious — is that it completely missed a major entity in the industry in question. This particular entity is not a well-known brand, but is a major player in the supply chain. It is a significant enough entity that any report about the industry that did not include them is, if you want to be generous, incomplete.

It is, in fact, the fourth categorization that Rumsfeld didn’t mention: “the unknown known.” Anyone who read the report that Deep Research generated would be given the illusion of knowledge, but would not know what they think they know.

### Knowledge Value

One of the most painful lessons of the Internet was the realization by publishers that news was worthless. I’m not speaking about societal value, but rather economic value: something everyone knows is both important and also non-monetizable, which is to say that the act of publishing is economically destructive. I wrote in [Publishers and the Pursuit of the Past](https://stratechery.com/2017/publishers-seek-antitrust-exemption-news-versus-advertising-a-better-solution-for-publishers/):

> Too many newspaper advocates utterly and completely fail to understand this; the truth is that newspapers made money in the past not by providing societal value, but by having quasi-monopolistic control of print advertising in their geographic area; the societal value was a bonus. Thus, when Chavern complains that “today’s internet distribution systems distort the flow of economic value derived from good reporting”, he is in fact conflating societal value with economic value; the latter does not exist and has never existed.
>
> This failure to understand the past leads to a misdiagnosis of the present: Google and Facebook are not profitable because they took newspapers’ *reporting*, they are profitable because they took their *advertising*. Moreover, the utility of both platforms is so great that even if all newspaper content were magically removed — which has [been tried in Europe](https://stratechery.com/2014/economic-power-age-abundance/) — the only thing that would change is that said newspapers would lose even more revenue as they lost traffic.
>
> This is why this solution is so misplaced: newspapers no longer have a monopoly on advertising, can never compete with the Internet when it comes to bundling content, and news remains both valuable to society and, for the same reasons, worthless economically (reaching lots of people is inversely correlated to extracting value, and facts — both real and fake ones — spread for free).

It is maybe a bit extreme to say has always been such; in truth it is very hard to draw direct lines from the analog era, defined as it was by [friction and scarcity](https://stratechery.com/2013/friction/), to the Internet era’s [transparency and abundance](https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/). It may have technically been the case that those of us old enough to remember newsstands bought the morning paper because a local light manufacturing company owned printing presses, delivery trucks, and an advertising sales team, but we too believed w
