# FRAME by Protege

FRAME (Fusion of Records and Medical Imaging Events) is a large multimodal healthcare imaging dataset that supports the training of AI models for diagnostics, disease progression modeling, and medical image analysis.

This dataset covers Electronic Health Record (EHR) data for nearly one million patients with imaging data, combining over ten million imaging studies. FRAME unlocks isolated imaging data and allows builders to train models using holistic patient information.

## KEY FEATURES

*   **Imaging + EHR Data at Scale**
    Over ten million imaging studies are connected to longitudinal patient EHR data.
*   **De-identified + HIPAA compliant**
    Personal identifiers in reports and notes replaced with realistic synthetic surrogates.
*   **Diverse and representative**
    Benchmarked against databases such as MEPS and the NIH AOU program for race and age representation.
*   **Inclusion of Survival Outcomes**
    External mortality data are linked to the cohort creating a "gold standard" of survival outcomes.

## THE OPPORTUNITY

Clinical decision-making relies on a diverse set of multimodal data, often including pixel-level information from imaging studies as well as patient-level clinical histories. To build models that emulate real-world diagnostic processes, models must be trained on complex multimodal data. Yet, today's AI builders face the following challenges:

*   Imaging at scale is hard to find: The largest publicly-available imaging datasets are often insufficient to train foundation models.
*   Data is fragmented: Patient notes are stored within the EHR, imaging data are stored within PACS, and both types of data are scattered across healthcare systems.
*   Longitudinal data are required for prediction: Information about patients' medical history, and often multiple consecutive imaging studies, are required to build models that can predict outcomes but are difficult to obtain.

## THE SOLUTION

FRAME addresses the foundational issues that hinder diagnostic discoveries by delivering three essential components:

*   **Scale:** by combining data across many providers, the scale of FRAME far exceeds typical research cohorts, with over 10M imaging studies covering x-ray, CT, PET, MRI, and ultrasound.
*   **Longitudinal curation:** our technology provides longitudinal linkage between imaging and EHR data, allowing AI builders to trace the temporal trajectory of disease, opening the door to disease progression prediction and even pre-disease state identification.
*   **Actionable unstructured data:** de-identified notes, including radiology reports, have been processed to flag positive pipelines using human-validated NLP technology.

## THE IMPACT

*   Forecast future risk, rather than just detecting existing disease
*   Build models with higher diagnostic accuracy and improved patient outcomes
*   Enhance your model's generalizability and fairness across subpopulations

One million patients with over ten million imaging studies.
