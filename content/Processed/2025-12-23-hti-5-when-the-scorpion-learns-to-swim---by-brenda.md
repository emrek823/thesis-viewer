What’s the old parable again?

> *A federal scorpion wants to cross an interoperability river but cannot swim, so it asks an EHR frog to carry it across to the other, deregulated side of the river.*
>
> *The EHR frog hesitates, afraid that the scorpion might sting it, but the scorpion promises not to, pointing out that it would drown if it killed the frog in the middle of the river.*
>
> *The frog considers this argument sensible and agrees to transport the scorpion, wanting to get to the deregulated side too.*
>
> *Midway across the river, the scorpion stings the frog with information blocking regulation anyway.*
>
> *The dying frog asks the scorpion why it stung despite knowing the consequence, to which the scorpion replies: "lol lmao" and swam to the other shore.*
>
> *To add insult to injury, he then flipped off the frog with HTI-6.*

Okay, we’re perhaps getting a bit too far down the metaphoric lane with no intro or explanatory text. Mea culpa - it’s hard not to get lost in the excitement of the first real regulatory drop in the new regime from our friends at the [Assistant Secretary for Technology Policy](https://www.healthit.gov/), the artist formerly known as the ONC.

We’d been expecting HTI-5, the long-awaited heir to the Cures throne, for some time. And the consensus expectation was straightforward: deregulation. In “[The Unified Agenda and Deregulation](https://healthapiguy.substack.com/p/the-unified-agenda-and-deregulation)” and “[Awaiting the Next Tablets](https://healthapiguy.substack.com/p/awaiting-the-next-tablets)”, we talked about why that expectation was rooted in the administration’s own top-of-funnel signaling via the Unified Agenda, where HTI-5 was explicitly flagged as deregulatory in aim.

> *The notice in the Unified Agenda shows HTI-5 (as many anticipated) will be deregulatory in aim. We aren’t getting fun new EHR capabilities like FHIR subscriptions out of this - we’ll see the number mandated capabilities and regulatory requirements on EHRs decrease in line with this administration’s overall hypothetical deregulatory push (Unleashing Prosperity Through Deregulation).*

The thesis then was simple: the government would likely reduce what EHRs are required to build, certify, and report. Fewer certification criteria. A trimming back of Meaningful Use-era leftovers. Less burden on EHRs. Less federal scorpion, more free-market frog.

What we maybe underweighted at the time is that deregulation of certification does not necessarily mean deregulation of conduct. You can shrink the checklist and still sharpen the stick. And as it turns out, while HTI-5 may indeed loosen the scaffolding around certified capabilities, it looks increasingly willing to tighten the screws on information blocking: fewer exceptions, fewer escape hatches, and far less patience for “market freedom” arguments once data is in motion.

The value of summary is limited in this LLM world we live in and the ASTP’s own [Fact Sheet](https://www.healthit.gov/topic/laws-regulation-and-policy/hti-5-proposed-rule-fact-sheet) is a great resource to this extent. However, a brief rundown ordered from most to least interesting:

* **Automated and agentic access is squarely in scope**, with revised definitions of “access” and “use” clarifying that autonomous systems and other automated means are subject to information blocking analysis
* **Information blocking regulatory burden increases**, with fewer exceptions, narrower conditions, and explicit concern about the misuse of the Infeasibility and Manner Exceptions to frustrate access, exchange, or use of EHI
* **TEFCA loses its special carve-out**, with the proposed removal of the TEFCA-specific Manner Exception signaling that participation in a federal exchange framework does not confer immunity from information blocking scrutiny
* **Certification is explicitly re-centered on APIs (particularly FHIR) rather than end-user functionality**, with non-FHIR, workflow-specific, and transport-specific requirements pared back or eliminated in favor of data access surfaces
* **The rule removes 34 criteria and updates 7** out of the 60 present today, shrinking the scope of the ONC Health IT Certification Program and continuing the retreat from Meaningful Use–era functional mandates
* **Conditions and Maintenance of Certification are materially reduced**, including descoping Real World Testing, narrowing Insights reporting, and removing other ongoing oversight mechanisms viewed as high-burden and low-yield.

Let’s dig into that overall picture of the proposed rule’s biggest takeaways and some of the surprises we saw. Also, if you’re looking for raw, unfiltered, and overly detailed comments, you might like the notes from my read-through yesterday [here](https://x.com/healthapiguy/status/2003222298397147363?s=20).

## Information Blocking

### RPA and Agents

HTI-5 is littered with references to AI, RPA, and agents, reflecting an agency that is clearly trying to be forward-thinking. From the preamble:

> *This would allow more creative artificial intelligence (AI)- enabled interoperability solutions that combine FHIR with newer standards to emerge, such as Model Context Protocol (MCP) which “standardizes how applications provide context to Large Language Models (LLMs)” , and further embrace the Cures Act’s reference to “…successor technology or standards…” in the API Condition of Certification.*

What’s notable here is not the endorsement of any specific technology (although they certainly signal a penchant for FHIR), but a deliberate rejection of technology-specific gatekeeping. ASTP is signaling that interoperability obligations should persist even as implementation paradigms evolve, rather than freezing compliance around today’s APIs or yesterday’s standards.

I’m supportive. From “[FHIR is Not The End of History](https://healthapiguy.substack.com/p/fhir-is-not-the-end-of-history)”:

> *It feels like we're almost at that moment and tipping point. The momentum with FHIR will continue and its utility will remain, but so many of the rigid, use case specific pipes we've built will feel silly as we graduate to the next era of exchange - perhaps MCP, perhaps something we haven't thought of yet, but almost certainly a data exchange mechanism that's LLM/AI native. Dumb, flexible pipes become infinitely more valuable than smart, rigid ones.*
>
> *To believe otherwise is to believe we’ve reached an end state that is not just the local maximum, but the absolute zenith of what’s possible. The only truth is that the things we’ve built will look dumb to the next generation.*

HTI-5 continues this theme and kicks off the information blocking revisions by proposing updates to the definitions of “access” and “use” to emphasize that they include automated means, explicitly calling out autonomous and agentic systems.

This is preemptive regulatory cleanup that matches t[heir recent FAQ on the topic](https://healthapiguy.substack.com/p/the-arc-is-now-explicit). It forecloses arguments that RPA, screen scraping, or AI-driven workflows fall outside information blocking analysis simply because they are not traditional API integrations. If a person is entitled to the data, their machine can be too, subject to exceptions (more on that below).

### Exception Cutting

From “[The Unified Agenda and Deregulation](https://healthapiguy.substack.com/p/the-unified-agenda-and-deregulation)”:

> *There’s been a lot of chatter of information blocking exceptions being slimmed down, as June’s [CMS Request for Information](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/05/16/2025-08701/request-for-information-health-technology-ecosystem) had specific language asking about that:*
>
> *…*
>
> *What exceptions could they target?*
>
> * ***HTI-3’s Protecting Care Access**: Health tech is mostly bipartisan in its arc, but [this exception](https://www.healthit.gov/topic/laws-regulation-and-policy/health-data-technology-and-interoperability-protecting-care-access) (intended to allow for some withholding of EHI for reproductive health care scenarios) is not. It will be cut due to conservative values and ongoing partisan culture wars.*
> * ***TEFCA-related stuff:** HTI-1 added the [TEFCA Manner exception](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-45/subtitle-A/subchapter-D/part-171/subpart-D/section-171.403) to make TEFCA a goldcard of sorts. [HTI-2](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/12/16/2024-29163/health-data-technology-and-interoperability-trusted-exchange-framework-and-common-agreement-tefca) added statutory language about TEFCA. They will propose removing both, but they’ll listen to comments here.*
> * ***Other exceptions**: Cutting anything beyond those would be absolutely wild. Most others feel reasonable, if narrowly interpreted (as the courts have done). Any other exception cutting would cause a lot of pushback from EHRs and providers as affected actors. Maybe some exceptions could be combined? Fees and licensing are similar, as are infeasibility and manner. But that also would just be shuffling cards.*

TEFCA indeed was cut, but the ASTP went well beyond my predictions and opted for “absolutely wild”. Instead of trimming around the edges, HTI-5 takes aim at the *structure* of several core exceptions themselves, explicitly citing misuse, abuse, and strategic deployment as justification for narrowing or outright removal:

> *Innovators and patient advocates indicated that some of the exceptions as currently codified may be too broad or are being misused in an anti-competitive or obstructive way.*

Perhaps it’s just alphabetization in play, but it’s easy to read into the ordering of parties there in terms of who these updates are for. The innovation ecosystem has a strong sway with this administration.

#### 1. Infeasibility Exception

HTI-5 squarely targets the [Infeasibility Exception](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-45/subtitle-A/subchapter-D/part-171/subpart-B/section-171.204), not by repealing it wholesale, but by removing or narrowing specific conditions ASTP/ONC believes have been weaponized.

##### Third-party seeking modification use condition (proposed removal)

This condition was a really complex double negative that disallowed an actor from claiming infeasibility when a third party sought to modify certified health IT (write data) and a provider was involved.

I liked this condition to the exception despite its complexity. At [HTD](https://htdhealth.com/), we include a section on it in our information blocking workshops specifically to show that write access to the EHR has always been within the scope of information blocking, despite persistent industry assumptions to the contrary.

However, because the condition was framed as a narrow carve-out from infeasibility (rather than a clear rule about when access must be provided), it became confusing to interpret and easy to invert. ASTP’s conclusion in HTI-5 is essentially that this level of indirection created more room for gamesmanship than protection. If modification truly raises security, integrity, or safety issues, those concerns are already covered elsewhere. If it doesn’t, the condition merely serves as a doctrinal speed bump that slows access without adding real analytical value.

ASTP says it has observed substantial growth in: “technical approaches that enable efficient, appropriately secure modification use as well as two-way exchange interactions between different developers’ systems”. This is odd for two reasons:

1. **There’s always been two-way exchange**. HL7 v2 interfaces, CCDAs with acknowledgements, eRx, lab results, ADT feeds…health IT has never been meaningfully “read-only.” Writing back into systems is not a new phenomenon, even if modern APIs and agentic workflows add new paths.
2. **The rise of new write-capable technologies doesn’t actually change the legal calculus**. Information blocking doctrine is intentionally technology-agnostic, a point ASTP itself emphasizes elsewhere repeatedly in HTI-5! Whether data is written via HL7 v2, FHIR, RPA, or some future protocol should not affect whether blocking analysis applies.

Unless I’m insane, under HIPAA, EHI is definitionally only EHI with a provider's involvement. A vendor wanting to connect to another vendor isn't dealing with EHI, so information blocking isn't in play as written. A vendor will still need to be a provider's business associate for a complaint.

However, this section had some verbiage that suggests the ASTP sees otherwise?

> "...potential business associates of the EHR developer’s health care provider customer, from accessing or using a health care provider’s EHR and relevant EHI
