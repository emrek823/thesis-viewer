## Key Data on 340B Sales

* Prescription drug spending in the U.S. grew 10.1% in 2024, for a total of $494.9 billion.[1](#1)
* Specialty medicines accounted for 54% of the national drug spending in 2024, primarily driven by growth in immunology and oncology.[2](#2) Trends impacting the healthcare market nationally are also reflected in the 340B space.
* The 340B Program is limited to outpatient settings. The scope of ambulatory care has expanded in volume and complexity of interventions over the past decade.[3](#3) As care increasingly shifts from inpatient to outpatient settings, spending on drugs associated with outpatient care increases. For example, separately payable drugs had a large share of outpatient prospective payment system (OPPS) spending, growing from 16.3% in 2015 to 27.4% in 2022.[4](#4) These drugs include advanced treatments such as specialty medications for patients with complex and chronic conditions or rare diseases.
* In alignment with the national trend, high-cost pharmaceuticals purchased through specialty distribution channels in the 340B Program represent an increasing proportion of the amount of 340B spending. While representing only 40% of all 340B units purchased, these high-cost pharmaceuticals purchased in the 340B Program through specialty channels accounted for 61.5% ($50.1 billion) of reported 340B purchases – illustrating the significant impact that the relatively smaller numbers of specialty units purchased has on overall 340B purchases.
* In 2024, the top 10 drugs in terms of 340B purchases represented approximately one-third of the total spending in the 340B Program.
