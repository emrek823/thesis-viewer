## Executive Summary
32Health is raising a $2M seed-II for 24 months of runway to execute on its current pipeline and reach $3M-$5M in ARR (with near-term potential to reach $10M+) prior to a Series A.

32Health is a potential breakout company based on our comps to top-decile healthcare SaaS companies in our portfolio and across market. In 9 months, the company has built an enterprise-grade platform, secured its first enterprise contract with Florida Dental Benefits (50K members; $300K ARR), and is in late-stage contract discussions with Ameritas (4.5M members; ~$15M ARR).

The team has exceeded our already high initial expectations, and we've only gotten more bullish over time on the dental insurance market and 32Health, specifically:
*   **Market Opportunity:** Our recent conversations with customers and industry insiders have increased our bullishness on the perceived “sleepy” dental space. 32Health has a window of time over the next 2-3 years to capitalize on trends driving dental insurers to automate their back-end processes to become the leader in a growing, but under-penetrated market ($3B in ARR today).
*   **Competition:** Direct exposure to competitors (Infosys, EIS, Skygen) from recent customer RFPs further demonstrates 32Health’s product advantage.

---

*   32Health's scalability, modularity, and automation already stands apart from service-heavy technology consulting firms or PE-backed competitors.
*   **GTM:** The company has generated a pipeline in 9 months with expected ACV of ~$14M with 9 companies in evaluation stage or later. Former CEOs of insurance companies and past presidents of the American Dental Association (ADA) are joining 32Health as sales consultants on commission to close customers from this pipeline.
*   **Product:** 32Health is 1-2 years ahead of our lofty expectations on product development from the seed. The team built an enterprise-grade platform with 14 separate SaaS modules in 9 months that typically takes companies tens of millions of dollars and 2-3 years to build.
*   **Comps analysis:** 32Health's potential ARR growth with Ameritas would make 32Health one of the fastest healthcare SaaS companies to $10M in ARR (<3 years). Even without Ameritas, the $3M-$5M in ARR conservatively projected from the rest of the pipeline would put them in the top-decile of ARR for healthcare SaaS companies.

Our close working relationship with the team has given us insider information and the confidence to double-down from an advantageous position at a flat price to the Seed-I (Oct-22). When we have a front row seat to early signals of success for product and sales oriented teams building healthcare SaaS businesses in large markets with limited competition, we are aggressive to get as much ownership as possible. The timing of impending contracts, 32Health's desire to work with insiders, and non-obvious opportunity in dental insurance give us the opportunity to do so.

We are investing $300K from the core fund and raising $1.5M SPV (15% carry) to for 14.6% ownership in a capital efficient healthcare SaaS business that can return the fund with <$500M exit.

## Market Opportunity
32Health has already signed a small/mid-size insurer (FDB), is in late-stage conversations with Ameritas (4.5M members), and has in-roads to multiple jumbo insurers (Aflac, Guardian, Prudential). Our conversations over the last 9 months

with potential customers and industry insiders have only made us more bullish that this market pull will be durable over the long-term.
*   **Dental drives insurer revenue for other bundled products for groups.** Medical insurance decisions are first made in isolation, and then brokers introduce all other insurance benefits (P&C, dental, disability, vision, hearing, etc) in a bundle to win deals with groups. Dental insurance is the most requested employee benefit after medical, so insurers are increasingly using dental as a wedge to influence bundle purchasing decisions. Insurers are trying to move quickly to capture this dental opportunity, but don't have the dental expertise or technology infrastructure to do so. Aflac, for example, acquired a regional dental plan 3 years ago but has been unable to cross-sell because its billing system doesn't process dental claims.
*   **Lower monthly premium for dental increases need for automation.** Dental insurers have an average monthly premium of $30-$40 per member per month (PMPM), ~5% of the average $600-$700 PMPM for medical. This difference in premium actually increases the need for dental insurers to invest in technology to improve operational efficiencies compared to medical. Dental insurers have similar PMPM costs for processing claims and benefits administration ($8-$9 PMPM) but less margin to work with because of lower premiums. These insurers need to reduce premiums or increase benefits to launch competitive dental offerings, so the only lever left to increase margins is reducing the cost of processing claims and benefits administration.

We estimate that the total ARR available for 32Health in the dental insurance market today is >$3B based on PMPM pricing by customer size (below). Shaju and Deepak drove strategy and execution for OverJet's insurance business which reached ~70M members in 4 years. If they can recreate half of that success, 32Health can reach $50M+ in ARR.

### Virtue Market Breakdown

## Competition
A majority of insurers are actively shopping for new vendors or looking to move off internal legacy platforms. The main competitors that 32Health sees in market are EIS, Infosys, and Skygen. These platforms have monolithic architectures (difficult to scale), batch vs. real-time processing (reduced automation), and lack any sophisticated AI (less accurate on data intake/underwriting).

**Infosys ($71B Market Cap):** Infosys technology and consulting services globally, with insurance being one of many verticals. The Infosys "platform" for insurers is more amorphous because most of their offerings are based off custom implementations for large enterprises where they can also make money on professional service fees. Infosys (or Accenture) was noted as the company executives had to bring into RFPs to “check the box".

**EIS (Founded 2008; 1,110 global employees; $100M investment from TPG):** The EIS Core Insurance Suite (PolicyCore, BillingCore, ClaimCore, and Customer Core) serves multiples lines of business, including P&C, Group Benefits, Life, Annuity, Healthcare, Dental, Disability. EIS was noted for its broad expertise across insurance (e.g., helped Guardian launch 5 new products, including dental) but lacking dental specific expertise (e.g., user interfaces) that drive day-to-day utilization. EIS may claim its cloud-native, but customers still struggle to create APIs to connect with legacy systems or build additional modules rapidly after initial implementation.

---

### EIS Suite
The EIS Suite diagram shows a layered architecture:
*   **Core Applications:** PolicyCore™, BillingCore™, ClaimCore™, CustomerCore™
*   **Customer360™:**
    *   **Applications:** Agent, Documents, Web, Mobile, Customer Support
    *   **Segment Data Model:** Group & Voluntary Benefits, P&C Personal Lines, P&C Commercial Lines
    *   **Configuration Factories:** Products, Rating & Pricing, Billing, Claims, Workflow & Rules, Data Conversion, Third-Party System Interfaces
*   **In-the-Box Services & Tools:** Workflow/BPM, Business Activity Monitoring (BAM), Doc Generation and Mgmt., Sub-Ledger, Analytics & Reporting, CustomerCore™ DXP (omnichannel), System Admin & Mgmt., Security/Privacy Mgmt.

**Skygen (Founded 1993; 35M members):** Skygen provides TPA services for the dental, vision, and medical markets, and is a roll-up of multiple TPA and insurance businesses over the last 30 years. Skygen has 10M+ members after being the only dental specific offering in market for a decade (fka Scion Dental), but has continued to lose market share over time as its technology infrastructure has failed to adapt. Customers evaluating Skygen noted it was difficult to plug in with their legacy systems, many claims still had to be processed manually, and any sophisticated reporting or analytics was nearly impossible for the average business user.

---

### Skygen Platform
The Skygen Continuous Claims Processing diagram illustrates:
*   **Incoming Claims:** From EDI, Web Portal, Paper.
*   **Processing Groups** funnel to:
    *   **Work Queue**
    *   **Adjudicate** (which involves Edit and HOW MUCH? steps)
*   **Adjudicate** output goes to **Pay**.
*   **Pay** generates payments and EOB (Explanation of Benefits).

## GTM
32Health sells into dental specific carriers (Florida Dental Benefits), insurers with multiple group product lines (Ameritas, Prudential), medical insurers (Blue Cross Blue Shield), and government organizations (state medicaid plans). 32Health's pricing and business model differs by product (shown below). Dental insurers can drive 45-55% savings on claims (offer more benefits with same premium) and 30-50% admin savings (reduction of current administration costs) when using 32Health's platform.

Shaju's background as a dental exec gives him the requisite market knowledge and relationships to sell into these insurers, but the team has supplemented that with a "BD council” of prior dental/insurance execs that meets 1-2x/weekly. This group is comprised of a former CEO from the insurance space, previous head of the ADA, and a CEO from another dental tech company that can cross-sell 32Health into his existing customer base. The initial GTM strategy has garnered strong interest from customers and generated a pipeline with expected ACV of ~$14M for 9 companies in evaluation stage or later. Over the next 12 months, 32Health is focused on signing additional small/mid-size carriers (e.g., another FDB), closing a mid/large-size carrier (Ameritas or Dominion Dental) and starting conversations with some of the Jumbo plans (5M+; Aflac).

## Comps Analysis

---

We've seen what excellent looks like for seed stage digital health companies over the course of the last 7 years in digital health broadly and within our own portfolio more recently (5 markups in last 3 months). We compare 32Health's potential revenue ramp with other high growth best-in-class healthcare SaaS companies (both with and without the potential Ameritas contract). As mentioned above, when we see evidence of this early outperformance we need to be aggressive.

### Virtue Portfolio Comparison (of select portfolio companies that have received Series A financings to date):
*   **Seen (8VC led $20M Series A at $55M post-money):** Approvals for PACE clinic build in Southern California and product ready for scale, but no revenue prior to Series A.
*   **SmarterDx (Bessemer led $15M Series A at $65M post-money):** When raising their seed at a $20M post, SmarterDx was at <$100K in ARR. Prior to the Series A a year later, the company was at $6M in CARR across 8 customers with 76% gross margins (B2B).
*   **Hero Journey Club (a16z and Northzone led $10.5M Series A at $50M post-money):** $500K annual revenue run-rate in <1 year with 50% gross margins (D2C).
*   **Evvy (Left Lane led $12M Series A at $60M post-money):** $3M revenue run-rate with 20K patients with 10% gross margins blended across diagnostic kit and care (D2C).

### Direct Insuretech Benchmarks:
Above, we comp 32Health to companies in a variety of markets to understand its potential ARR growth in context. In insurtech specifically, we look at comps in market to quantify the size of these markets (multiple large winners in medical), the value placed on high-growth, software businesses in this space (HealthEdge vs. Trizetto multiple) and how cash efficiently these businesses can scale (VBA).
*   **Cognizant acquired Trizetto in 2014 for $2.7B.** At the time, Trizetto provided core administration solutions for 350 payers with 180M lives, generating $570M for payers and an additional $141M in revenue for providers.
*   **HealthEdge (32Health comp in medical):** HealthEdge is currently valued at $3B with $400M in revenue (7.5x revenue multiple) with 15% EBITDA margins.
*   **Spectrum Equity recently invested $156M in VBA,** a cloud-based benefits software for healthcare payers. VBA had only raised $15M previously.

## Product Development
In the span of 9 months, 32Health has built an enterprise-grade platform with 14 separate SaaS modules that typically takes other companies tens of millions of dollars and 2-3 years to build. The "32Health Product Overview" in the data room provides a comprehensive overview of the platform, but we highlight below the key areas of differentiation that drive our excitement.

**Comprehensive Platform:** In a sea of point solutions, 32Health has built a comprehensive platform to rip and replace an insurer's entire back-end claims processing and benefits administration. We see multiple companies in market raising tens of millions of dollars to build singular pieces of 32Health's solution (claim adjudication, benefit design, provider credentialing, etc).

### Infrastructure
32Health embraces the rapid evolution of cloud infrastructure to leapfrog solutions created even 5 years ago, let alone most of their competitors' platforms built >10 years ago. Scalable API enterprise management (Apigee) allows them to manage and build multiple modules quickly. Natively building in Google Cloud's core infrastructure gives them the ability to scale from 10s of thousands of members to millions. BigQuery, Google's serverless, highly scalable, enterprise data warehouse launched in 2012, has added powerful new capabilities such as streaming ingestion, support for standard SQL, and better integrations with BI/ETL systems.

The **Infrastructure diagram** shows various Google Cloud services:
*   Cloud SQL - scales vertically
*   BigQuery - scales horizontally
*   Cloud Spanner - scales horizontally
*   Cloud Storage - scales 'infinitely'
*   Kubernetes Autopilot
*   Cloud Run (serverless)
*   Cloud Functions (serverless)
*   VertexAI
*   Cloud Pub/Sub
*   Firestore/Datastore
*   Compute that scales w Workload
*   DB that scales w data

### AI/ML:
32Health is leveraging its unique relationship with HuggingFace, which gives them access to HuggingFace engineers weekly ($60K annual cost; estimated value of 3-4 additional engineers) to discuss and design new product features. Vertex AI provides the pipeline to actually deploy the models developed on HuggingFace into production. The initial use cases where AI is making an impact is in data ingestion (e.g. OCR for paper claims) and in 32Health's “AI Contact Center” product offering. 32Health is already exploring additional design partnerships with customers for AI-assisted underwriting and additional automations for plan design.

The **AI/ML diagram** illustrates the "AI Contact Center" flow:
*   **Customer** interacts via **Channels**: Voice, SMS, Mobile Web, Chat.
*   **Google Cloud Contact Center AI** uses Cloud Natural Language API, Cloud Speech-to-Text API, Cloud Translation API.
*   This feeds into the **32Health Bot**, which interacts with Claims DB, Member DB, and Provider DB.
*   An **Agent** is also part of the interaction flow.
*   Partners: NICE, AVAYA OneCloud, CISCO, twilio.

### 24-month Product Roadmap:
32Health will continue to invest in product development to drive additional revenue for customers (green), reduce operational costs (blue), improve business user experience (red), and improve compliance (black). 32Health has shown it can build a high-quality enterprise-grade platform

## Financials/Milestones
32Health is raising this additional $2M in a seed-II financing to take their first enterprise clients live in 2024, execute on its pipeline, and continue to invest in product innovation.

Below is management's financial projections with Ameritas that we view as the aggressive scenario. In this case, Ameritas is driving >80% of 2025E gross revenue of $14.3M. Implementation fees for Ameritas are projected to be $6M ($3M annually over 2 years) while others (FDB, Cascade Community Health) are in the range of hundreds of thousands. After initial R&D ramp, which decreases to 20% of sales after 2026, 32Health can scale its 70% gross margin product to a wide range of customers.

We also looked at financial projections without Ameritas to understand how 32Health can reach Series A metrics in a more conservative scenario. This conservative scenario requires 32Health to close 1-2 mid/large-size carriers similar to Ameritas (e.g., Life and Specialty Ventures (LSV)) that are already in the pipeline for its core admin platform and 3-4 insurers for its provider network module.

## Return the Fund (RTF) Analysis
As with every investment, we run a scenario analysis to understand the potential for an individual company to return the fund (RTF; $31.25M). 32Health is a capital efficient, high gross margin (>70% at scale) enterprise SaaS business that has already built the core components of its enterprise platform with <$2M burned. With ~14.6% ownership and baking in assumptions around downstream dilution, we can return the fund with a <$500M acquisition with potential upside for a $1B business ($100M ARR across 1 jumbo and 3-5 mid/large enterprise clients, and 5-7 small/mid).

## Risks
*   **Failure to sign Ameritas.** Ameritas represents a $15M ARR initial contract for 32Health, but this contract is by no means guaranteed. Ameritas has acknowledged 32Health's superior product, but has gone through multiple demos and in-person meetings with 100+ Ameritas team members to get comfortable working with a startup <1 year old. We are willing and aggressive to get ahead of the potential risk with the Ameritas contract at the same price as the seed because the potential upside with Ameritas (best-in-class Series A traction for healthcare SaaS startups) is protected by our understanding of a conservative growth scenario (continue to execute on rest of current pipeline to reach $3M+ in ARR in lower end of dental market with antiquated competitive set). When we get comfortable with this asymmetric upside given our close relationship with management and view into the business, we double down to capture this upside while remaining protected in a conservative scenario.
*   **Implementation.** The implementation fees for Ameritas are $6M ($3M spread over 2 years), which represents the substantial lift required to rip and replace an insurer's core back-end claims processing. Implementations at this scale always carry risk with multiple parties involved at the enterprise level (IT, finance, benefit design, executive committee, etc). 32Health has worked to mitigate many of these risks through its early work in building a modular platform to quickly spin up additional products or interfaces customers ask for (e.g., Ameritas' request for broker module) and line up a hiring pipeline of engineers through their network in India to execute on the work to be done.
