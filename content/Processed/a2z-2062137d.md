# a2z Radiology AI Pitch Deck

## Slide 1: Title Slide

**Pitch Deck**

Welcome to the Software 3.0 for Medicine
a2z Radiology AI

**a2z**
RADIOLOGY AI

## Slide 2: We are building AI Radiologist Residents

We are building
AI
Radiologist
Residents

## Slide 3: Current State of Radiology AI Solutions

Today, commercial Radiology AI solutions can detect ~2% of diseases that a radiologist does

Radiologists expend time and mental effort on each case.
Radiology practices must pay for each AI solution ($10-100k) & radiologist salaries ($450k).

## Slide 4: Our Vision for AI Radiologist Colleagues

Our "AI radiologist colleagues" will do everything that a radiologist does

Radiologists can save extensive time and mental effort on each case.
Radiology practice has to pay for one AI solution and can hire fewer radiologists.

## Slide 5: Video Demo

Video Demo

## Slide 6: Solution Performance

Our solution is #1 in report generation for chest X-rays, outperforming Google's MedPALM-M by 11%.

Publication coming in Aug 2024

## Slide 7: Ongoing Research Breakthroughs for AI Radiologist

01
Single-phase 3D medical images (CT, MRI)

02
Multi-phase 3D medical images

03
Incorporation of human feedback

04
Measurements of lesions

05
Longitudinal comparisons

**Ongoing Research Breakthroughs for AI Radiologist**

Talented team in Harvard lab actively working on breakthrough directions

## Slide 8: Market Opportunity

**Near Future AI Resident**
*   Charge a radiology provider $20K per radiologist per year
*   35K radiologists US = $700M
*   350K radiologists global = $7B

**10-year Future Autonomous AI**
*   Charge $1-10 per scan to hospitals
*   5B+ scans globally
*   6% CAGR
*   $9B-$90B annually

## Slide 9: Why We Will Win

**Why we will win**

**We will extend our technology lead:**
We have talent access and research lead. Initially, this is through Harvard, but will funnel into company.
We are creating flywheel effect from feedback.

**We have deep domain expertise:**
CS-only teams underestimate domain complexity.
Needed for clinical studies for regulatory + sales.

**We have networks and brand:**
Startups struggle to establish even pilots.
Harvard brand gets us through door.
