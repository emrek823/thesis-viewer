### Company Overview & Technology

- Clerics: fighting hospital-acquired infections (HAI)
	- 1 in 31 people get HAI ($45B problem)
	- Kurt’s grandmother nearly died from C diff/sepsis after routine checkup
- Kurt’s background: 6-year PhD at McMaster using DNA sequencing for infectious disease detection
- Technology approach:
	- Sequence pathogen genomes + environmental metagenomes
	- Compare building-level wastewater, room air samples, surface/sink swabs
	- Identify infection sources (e.g., patient infection matches sink in room 4A)
	- Hybrid capture protocol reduces sequencing costs from $100 to <$5 per reaction
	- 6-hour turnaround (sample pickup 9am → PCR results 3pm)

### Operations & Customer Experience

- Fully end-to-end service (hospitals don’t lift a finger)
	- Daily technician visits for wastewater/air samples
	- Monthly surface and drain swabs
	- All processing done in Clerics facility
- Deliverables pyramid:
- Building “digital twin of hospital environment” as genomic data asset
- Future vision: operating system for infectious disease across all built environments

### Business Model & Value Proposition

- ROI for hospitals: $5-10M incremental operating income for average academic hospital
	- Cost savings: ~$1M from preventing never-events (surgical site infections, etc.)
	- Efficiency gains: $6.1M from reducing length of stay (6.4 → 6.3 days average)
- Pricing model: facility-level wastewater sampler + clinical isolate allocation, plus ward-level modules
- Market expansion: hospitals ($3B) → all built environments ($24B SAM)
	- Train models on hospital data, deploy reference-free models to nursing homes, schools, manufacturing, offices
- Talked to 260 doctors/researchers for market validation

### Next Steps

- Virtue to review internally and respond by end of week/early next week
- Potential introductions to health system CFOs and genomics experts for technical diligence
- Clerics interested in additional health system contacts for validation
