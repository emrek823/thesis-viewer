# Philips Predictive Maintenance for Medical Imaging

Philips Healthcare uses predictive analytics to achieve zero unplanned equipment downtime for MRI, CT, and IGT systems.

## Data Scale

Per Mauro Barbieri, Principal Architect Service at Philips Healthcare:

"Just one of our sophisticated MRI scanners will log **a million events** and deliver **200,000 sensor readings every day**, based on tens of thousands of data elements."

## Current Success Rates (2024)

Per Garry Jepp, Head of Services Operations at Philips:
- **MRI:** 35% of maintenance cases solved predictively
- **IGT:** 20% solved predictively
- **CT:** 17% solved predictively

"We are developing these capabilities fast to constantly improve the customer experience. If you can predict it, you can prevent it."

## How It Works

- Multiple failure modes modeled for key components
- Service actions designed to be non-intrusive
- Maintenance scheduled proactively during least disruptive times
- Alerts generated based on data analysis
- Remote monitoring team reviews alerts
- Clinical workflows remain uninterrupted

## Results

- **~30% reduction** in unplanned downtime
- Proactive, data-driven maintenance vs reactive
- Machine learning models enable scheduled, predictable, non-intrusive service

## Global Deployment

Platform scaled globally with regional compliance adaptations, including separate China version for data sovereignty.
