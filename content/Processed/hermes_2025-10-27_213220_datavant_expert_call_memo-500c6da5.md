# Overview
The expert is the Vice President of Service Operations at Datavant, responsible for a $100M P&L; and a workforce of 260 across six states. They oversee HIS systems, patient and provider request tools, and digital fulfillment services across both provider and payer workflows. Their remit includes operational leadership, strategic planning, and driving financial performance for Datavant's Release of Information (ROI) division.

# Responsibilities & Scope
The VP manages Datavant's end-to-end medical record retrieval operations for large health systems including Johns Hopkins, MedStar, and Inova. Their teams handle records on-site at hospitals and remotely for clinics, payers, and legal clients. Responsibilities include budgeting, workforce management, compliance adherence, and process efficiency improvements across digital and manual channels.

# Operational Model
Datavant acts as an ROI vendor, contracted primarily by hospitals and payers to process patient, payer, and legal record requests. The company charges per page and per request under state-specific fee structures. Typical pricing averages $0.25 per page, while patient requests are free under federal law. Contracts with payers and hospitals differ—payers are charged directly, while hospitals operate on service agreements that include volume and fulfillment terms.

# Request Workflow
Each record retrieval request follows a standardized process: intake, authorization verification, quality assurance, record extraction from the EMR, and delivery. Processors verify HIPAA compliance, ensure accurate date ranges and identifiers, and extract the requested data from EHRs such as Epic or Cerner. Requests are typically completed within 5-7 days, with delays primarily caused by incorrect or incomplete authorizations. Processing beyond 30 days can trigger OCR compliance risks or patient complaints.

# Technology & Integration
Datavant uses APIs to connect its ROI platform directly to EMRs—primarily Epic and Cerner, which support more robust API access. Other systems like eClinicalWorks, Greenway, and NextGen have limited interoperability. Through these integrations, Datavant automates retrieval for common use cases like continuing care, where digital abstraction minimizes manual labor. However, legal and subpoena requests still require manual workflows due to state-specific privacy and authentication requirements.

# Digital vs Manual Processing
While electronic delivery has grown significantly, many hospitals and attorneys still rely on fax and mail due to state regulations and legacy workflows. For continuing care requests, API-based abstraction is common, but for legal and payer requests, paper or fax remains the dominant medium. The company's processors—full-time Datavant employees—remain embedded on-site at many hospitals, handling patient walk-ins, mail, and call center operations.

# Staffing & Coverage Model
Datavant assigns processors to health systems based on incoming request volume and contract scope. Some contracts require full-service coverage (including patient walk-ins and calls), while others are basic service agreements handled remotely. Coverage planning considers volume distribution across multi-hospital systems and staffing availability in high-demand regions such as New Jersey, Maryland, and Virginia.

# Compliance & Legal Framework
HIPAA regulations mandate that record requests be fulfilled within 30 days, though exceptions exist for complex or incomplete authorizations. Each state also has unique laws dictating pricing, format, and acceptable delivery methods for records. Patient requests are free, while legal and insurer requests follow state-specific pricing rules—typically $0.25 per page, with flat fees for radiology or imaging.

# Middleware & API Infrastructure
The expert clarified that Datavant employs middleware (API interfaces) to connect its ROI platform with EMRs for automated retrieval. These APIs allow for mapping of record templates (e.g., abstracts, full charts) and digital delivery to requesting parties. Epic's structured templates allow deeper automation, while smaller EMRs limit automation capabilities.

# Data Retention & Usage
Datavant stores retrieved medical records for approximately one year for audit and compliance purposes. Retention enables traceability in case of patient or provider complaints but does not allow record reuse for new requests. When a health system terminates a contract, stored data must be deleted or returned, consistent with compliance policies.

# Revenue & Partnerships
Datavant maintains revenue-sharing models internally but does not partner with external middleware or channel partners for shared revenue. Revenue per contract is managed through Salesforce-based tracking systems. Labor costs remain the dominant expense driver, and offshoring has been evaluated but deemed unproductive due to data sensitivity and quality concerns.

# Customer Segments
Key customer categories include:
*   Providers and health systems (primary contracts)
*   Payers (Blue Cross, Optum, and others)
*   Attorneys and legal requestors (subpoenas, personal injury)
*   Workers' comp, life insurance, and disability insurers.
Each category follows distinct workflows governed by separate state and federal compliance requirements.

# Market Observations & Industry Context
The expert emphasized that while technology has accelerated record processing, the industry remains constrained by EHR fragmentation and legal compliance. Epic and Cerner dominate large systems, creating uneven access for smaller EMRs. Despite digitization, staffing and compliance remain significant cost centers, and manual workflows persist where regulations restrict automation.

# Summary Takeaways
Datavant's ROI operations combine large-scale human workflows with growing digital automation. The company's structured approach to compliance, staffing, and EMR integration supports high throughput and operational reliability. While API expansion and interoperability improvements have improved efficiency, meaningful digitization remains gradual, particularly for legal and payer requests. The next frontier in efficiency will depend on deeper Epic integrations, cross-system data exchange, and regulatory flexibility to allow greater digital record portability.
