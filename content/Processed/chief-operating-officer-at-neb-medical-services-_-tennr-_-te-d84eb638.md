# Document Content

Sure. We're a durable medical equipment company. We specialize a couple of different products, namely breast pumps, pediatric nebulizers, incontinence supplies, and continuous glucose monitors. We work primarily in the states of Illinois and Wisconsin. We receive referrals from approximately maybe about 2,500 active referral facility sources right now, with many more physicians and providers as part of that network. Pretty high volume business for the products that we deal in. We were forced to look for an automation that we can leverage to handle our volume on a timely basis.

## Client
Makes sense. You're primarily trying to solve the problem of patient referral. You're probably going to get a fax from a doctor, and then you're going to make a patient card, etc. Is that the process?

## Expert
That's right. Oddly, the DME business is still primarily driven on fax. There are some, of course, digital solutions that are slowly making their way through the market but an overwhelming amount of our orders, probably to the tune of, I would say 90%-95% of our orders are still handwritten fax documents.

## Client
Makes sense. Actually, after taking a step back, would be really helpful for us if you could just break down this entire process. Let's say there's a doctor who recommends a patient to you, from there to you actually going about diagnosing them, if you could just give me the entire spiel, that'd be really helpful.

## Expert
Sure. I don't mind sharing a bit about our business. The DME network, I think a number of organizations operate a little bit differently. Of course, some rely more on marketing, some more on marketing reps to get out into the office and solicit drug pharmaceutical representatives. We're more similar to the latter. We have a number of field reps that are out there calling on offices to educate physician offices on our products and services. We really find that it's a big educational component because not every DME company is going to accept every single insurance company that that physician may accept.

### Sean Doolan
There's quite a bit of matchmaking in terms of a doctor selecting a DME company to use for particular types of services. Our reps are out there to do that. When they do so successfully, typically what we see is a pretty consistent referral rate coming through that doctor's office for the products that we supply. Like I mentioned, that's typically by fax, typically handwritten documents. We do accept digital orders. We work with a platform I'm sure you're familiar with called Parachute.

We also receive some digital orders through EMR systems like Athena orders. Both of those feed basically automatically into our DME software, which is Brightree. That handled small volume of our orders. We again needed a solution to deal with the high volume, the 90%-95% of fax orders that are coming in. We've gone through a number of iterations at our company. We had a very difficult time trying to keep American staff focused on the task of intake and fax wrangling.

It wasn't long until we realized we needed to go overseas to do that more efficiently and at a better cost. We've had an organization that we work with for quite some time doing that fax wrangling. Unfortunately, it just can't be done fast enough. Even if you have dedicated people to only intaking faxes at a basic level, meaning entering the minimum amount of information possible to intake those patients, we still dealt with a timing component where Dr. Office may call in and ask if we've received faxes.

If you haven't worked through your queue yet, then of course you haven't exactly seen that order yet. We have patients that call in that want to know if we've received the order right away. This creates more problems than we wanted to deal with. We realized it's just an information flow. We looked for an alternative solution and ultimately decided on Tennr.

## Client
Makes sense. Just taking a step back and trying to understand the pain point here. You mentioned that you transitioned from doing these things in house with your staff to actually working with an outsourced partner like a BPO. How many people were working in your team on the patient intake workflow prior to the

### Conversation Transcript

**Client:** Makes sense. What happened to them the minute you outsourced? Were they moved on to other tasks internally?

**Expert:** For the most part, yeah.

**Client:** Makes sense. Just trying to understand here. First, I appreciate the fact that things aren't happening as smoothly as you would like with the outsourced vendor, but is there any regulatory overhang as well where they're trying to make sure you guys don't offshore this data outside the United States?

**Expert:** Yeah, there's a concern there. You need to work with an organization that can do that in a compliant fashion.

**Client:** Awesome. Maybe just to double click a little bit here, if you could help me understand what your evaluation set looked like when you were looking at Tennr. Who else did you speak with and test out?

**Expert:** Yeah. We spoke with Parachute. They offer a similar fax, AI automation, and ultimately a couple of reasons, perhaps we decided against that. One of them including the design of that system to be an on-ramp to really the way that they prefer that orders come in in a digitalized fashion. For instance, fax order comes in if you work with Parachute for their AI intake on the handwritten document, it seems that they can perform that test successfully. Should that order be missing any information, their request is that that outbound request to the physician's office to obtain the missing information is done via their digital platform.

The return information would result in a pay-per-order situation. First of all, you'd have to more or less onboard that physician's office into buying into the idea of sending orders through Parachute. That includes sending them a link to get onto their platform as a guest, ultimately leading them onto their full-time basis. The nature of our business, with it being high volume in the way that it is and the current cost structure of Parachute, our evaluation is that that methodology was just going to be enormously expensive and cost-prohibitive.

**Client:** I think it's a great point. I would love to understand from you, how do you guys price this solution? First with the BPO vendors, is it on a per-patient basis, and then now with these AI solutions, what's the pricing model like?

**Expert:** Our outsourced team is just hourly or monthly per head, so it's not a per-patient basis, and they have staff available to assist us with whatever we may need. That same team is still currently working with us and we've moved a number of them into the Tennr system to perform the duties necessary there. We've also put a few of them downstream to handle some situations that are post-intake and fax wrangling. Still on an hourly/monthly fee basis there. Our contract with Tennr, there's a variety of services that we're currently contracted for, and that's mostly done on a monthly rate per service. Some of those are volume-based.

## Conversation Transcript

**Client:**
Makes sense. Would love to double check a little bit into what Tennr exactly does here. We don't have a full understanding. Of course we understand it has some OCR which helps you move from a manually written fax document or handwritten note to a patient form. Would really appreciate if you could double click that.

**Expert:**
Sure. Really the problem that we needed to solve first was fax wrangling and intake. That's of course where we started with them. Like I said, our outsource team is working in that Tennr dashboard now. Rather than working out of our fax queue in our DME software that staff is logging into the Tennr dashboard where patients are basically presented to them to process. Yeah, in an OCR-like way we have a split screen where we've got our patient document on the left side and then the fields on the right side that are mapping to our DME software.

It's really just at this point a human review and confirmation system as we found the accuracy to increase over time. We've also been able to enable some of these data entry fields with a high confidence score to be put onto autopilot so we don't have to actually do the confirmation component. That was the first place we started, and it worked beautifully actually. We have basically no fax queue where we went from being behind hundreds of orders on a daily basis.

Mondays are always the ugliest for us after a weekend because we're not open during the weekend, but we still receive faxes. We are purging our fax queue on the daily with two employees very easily, and they're able to actually even perform some additional duties as well. That was the first place that we started. There are other services that we're using Tennr for now.

**Client:**
That's super useful, actually. Just to understand, you went from probably five folks who are doing this full time to now maybe two alongside Tennr. Would that be a fair approximation?

**Expert:**
Yeah.

**Client:**
Makes sense. I'm just curious to understand this entire process you mentioned. Where you guys started with two parallel side screens and then build a confidence score eventually. How long did that process take? What's the onboarding process with Tennr like?

**Expert:**
The onboarding, honestly, we were I think one of the earlier customers, so we probably signed on in 2024. We would began talks I think as early as May. I'm assuming I executed agreement somewhere around the end of June or early July. A little bit of a delay until we got started, but it was probably a two to three month implementation before we actually started to pull real live data into the system. Unfortunately, we did experience a little bit of a hiccup with an architect that they assigned us to that wasn't as diligent as he needed to be or as well organized. I was actually really impressed with the way Tennr handled that situation and replaced him, and they needed to do so.

We didn't fully understand that it was him at the time that was causing the issues. The next person that stepped in was very quick to repair the situation. Almost immediately upon him starting, we really turned a corner. I think we were successfully using the system somewhere around early December. Maybe a little bit of an unusual path compared to the average customer, I would assume, for them at this point as they've become a little bit more mature and organized. It was the implementation and, like I said, we've added some services since.

**Client:**
Super useful actually. Would love to understand what the implementation here look like. In terms of criteria, you care about the EHR integration. Anything else that should be top of mind for you guys?

# Document Content

## Expert
Yeah, that's the biggest component. We had to adapt to the types of conversations that we were having with Tennr in order to implement this. I think if you're a well organized company, that you have workflows already mapped out with your team. In order for us to outsource our data entry, patient creation, sales order creation, certainly those instructions are provided to the outsourced team. I felt like working with an outsourced team was a light version of getting prepared to work with a company like Tennr.

As you get into the world of automation, I think all scenarios become quite a bit more black and white. You need an if-then statement for almost every scenario. I think the most time-consuming part of implementation for us was just getting on the same page with them on those if-then statements. In other words, designing the architecture, that was necessary to make this work. I think our involvement in doing that was maybe a little bit more than we anticipated.

As a result of having to do it, I feel like our organization is run leaner and more tight internally in terms of understanding of the exact process flow really across our organization. The communication between our staff has become much more clear and concise, as a byproduct of working in this way. Not only do I feel like the system performs well, the Tennr system has definitely led to efficiencies, but I think that has an interesting byproduct, we've really become more efficient as well.

## Client
Super interesting, actually. I would love to understand here a little bit. You mentioned, of course, the entire fax wrangling piece, and that makes complete sense. What are the other offerings that Tennr really has, and have you guys considered adopting them?

## Expert
Yeah. We're implementing a few right now. The first is what they call the qualifications worker. Do you have any familiarity with this worker?

## Client
No, actually. We really have to get a quick one on one.

## Expert
Okay. DME orders, not all of them per se, but many of them, especially the products that are Medicare covered, have to meet certain clinical criteria, justification for the patient to receive the equipment. Not only do we have to get a prescription for that patient and have a legible document with the patient's demographics and insurance information, there's a provider portion where we need to make sure we've got a diagnosis, provider signature, and date. That would be your prescription component. For some supplies, like a continuous glucose monitor, for instance, you need to have a clinical justification for why the patient needs that device.

The justification varies from device to device, disease state to disease state. It's pretty dynamic. When you deal with different insurance companies, those justifications and requirements can vary as well. It's a pretty complex logic tree that requires pretty intensive training with staff, and oftentimes I think transcends a couple different departments within a DME company. It may involve your billing department to investigate the payer requirements so that you can review the patient's chart adequately and determine if they've met the necessary requirements.

Also takes the customer service department to oftentimes relay some information back to the physician about what may or may not be missing to the patient about what may or may not be missing. It can be often pretty complex. Tennr's qualifications worker takes the clinical criteria required by payers, for instance, Medicare, I don't know how they technically load this in, but they get it loaded in on their side, and then they use it to evaluate patient charts. We will get a prescription, we'll make sure it's a valid prescription, and then we'll get a bunch of supporting documentation.

It could be face-to-face visit notes, medical history. It's often 10 to sometimes 50 pages worth of material that we have to have a human manually review and search through and highlight, so to speak. The Tennr

**Client:**
That's super useful actually. We'd just love to understand as well, I think Tennr also mentions they do prior auth. Is that something you guys consider as well or would this fall under the same bucket?

**Expert:**
It is something we're considering, it's not something we're working with. The types of products that we work in are not a high volume of prior auth. It's really not a pain point that's necessarily at the top of our list. There's a pain point nonetheless. I think one of the reasons we haven't necessarily gotten to it yet is so many of these prior authorizations are done through phone calls and fax communication. It's just very tedious in that way. For the phone situation, Tennr doesn't offer a solution necessarily that's operational to my knowledge on that side of things. I think we're working on it, but I haven't seen anything yet.

**Client:**
Makes complete sense. Taking a step back here, I would like to understand from you if something like a Tennr or a Silna makes more sense for a DME or an HME, or for health systems as well. Does it make sense for providers like yourselves, but do you think like a Mayo or a Cleveland who are also require a prior auth and patient intake solution?

**Expert:**
Yeah. I suppose I'd have to have some knowledge about how they're currently ingesting that information now. I can't imagine it's all that different in the way that we have to do it. If that's the scenario, then of course it can help. Certainly it can help in that prior authorization when they have things ironed out the way that I anticipate they will. We found this organization to be incredibly dynamic and in my opinion, the leadership is very clear on their other motivations and instructions and roles. I would think so. I know they're working in the diagnostic world now and I understand that's been pretty beneficial.

**Client:**
Makes sense. Typically, how large do some of these contracts with Tennr look like? What's the ballpark number or like a good thumb rule for pricing to get a sense of the contract sizes?

**Expert:**
Yeah, there's something there that I can share necessarily. For other organizations I've maybe heard some figures, but just not in a position to stay. For my own organization, it's part of our contract we're not to share that information. Unfortunately I can't but I can tell you that, obviously, economical enough for us to want to get into it versus our previous situation of outsourcing.

**Client:**
Makes complete sense. Just trying to understand here, your experience with Tennr, you mentioned, of course the onboarding had some hiccups and they went over that. If you rate them on a scale of 1-10, how high would you rate them? Would you recommend them to your colleagues?

**Expert:**
Yeah, I absolutely would recommend to our colleagues. It's tough because our DME world is a pretty tight knit community. There are competition. There's always some reluctance to want to share a industry secret, if you will, but absolutely I would. I think the organization is fantastic.

**Client:**
Makes sense. Would you give them a nine or 10?

### Expert's Rating
**Expert**: I would give them a nine. Nobody's perfect, but I'd give it a nine.

### Client Inquiry
**Client**: Yeah. I'm also get a sense of if you're exploring other AI solutions broadly in your organization, is this mandate coming more top down or functional leaders like yourself? You're obviously a part of the CXO leadership but also functional leaders coming in and telling you, "Hey, I want to try this solution." Just trying to understand how you guys are thinking about AI as a whole.

### Expert's Response
**Expert**: I've been presented at a number of solutions. I was just at a regional trade show in Minnesota. It's called Mames. Again, it's a regional association, covers eight or 10 different states and there are a lot of vendors that attend this event. Pretty well organized event. I don't know how many different companies appeared this year that were allegedly AI solutions in this capacity, in a Tennr like capacity. Gosh, it felt like maybe there were six or eight that I just had never seen before or heard of.

There's quite a few of them coming out. When you've made the investment of time to get through those architecture stages with Tennr to get them incorporated into your DME billing software and integrate in that way, you're pretty committed for a while in my opinion. I can share that I did sign a multi year contract with that company just because I don't see us likely to want to change because we've got so much upfront cost. In terms of speaking with competitors in that arena, I will talk to them and keep an eye on what the progress is.

It's really a long-term thing in my opinion. There's a couple of other organizations that are doing voice AI calling that is of interest. We are actively using one right now. We've been I think now about two months live and we've had some great success. A lot of our outbound calling for different types of orders. We may get a fax in from a physician office for a continuous glucose monitor and we need to get in touch with the patient. We're going to leverage texting if we can, if we have permission to do so. We're going to do some outbound calling.

We'll do whatever we can to get a hold of the patient. It often results in a voicemail. Voice AI dialing has been helpful to lead some voicemails but we've also seen great success with patient contact and working through some specific use cases. We've provided them with specific criteria in terms of limiting the number of insurance companies that the system would call out to the patient on. It's not company-wide, it's also product-specific. We've built a pretty decent matrix to have this voice AI agent call on probably about, I would say 60%-70% of our orders at this point.

They've been able to do some pretty impressive work. I'm blown away actually at how realistic it sounds. It's also scraping like large language models. It's pretty valuable in terms of answering just commonly asked questions, which is often a training concern with some of our human CFRs. When that agent fails, we do have a live transfer into a line where we got a human mating and hopefully can pick it up from there. We've seen pretty good success. Maybe about a 20% call confirmation rate, probably about a 20% transfer to human rate and then the remainder is voicemail.

### Client Follow-up
**Client**: That's super interesting actually. Would love to understand what that solution is called.

### Expert's Solution
**Expert**: That solution is called Armory.

### Client's Reflection
**Client**: Makes sense. I know you made a great point previously about there's obviously a litany of AI solutions out there and it's almost overwhelming for you as a decision-maker. How are you guys cutting through the noise? I understand Tennr, of course, was early in the journey, but now as you explore new solutions, let's say Armory, for example, there's probably four or five who sound equally credible who are fairly early in the...

## Expert Insights on AI Solutions in Healthcare

### Evaluation Framework
**Expert:**
Like I said, it's fairly limited at this point because we've only been into the Tennr system for so long and the investment made to get into there it's unlikely to change my mind, but as we've looked at them, I've seen a lot of copycat scenarios and to me that's fine. I do believe that those could theoretically even make things better. I'm a fan of competition, so at a bare minimum there's that. At this point, I love the vision of Tennr. I think, like I said, the leadership has a relentless attitude towards paving the way. I'm interested to see what they can develop further.

They're also pretty good about getting feedback from their customers, evaluating what our pain points are, and trying to come up with solutions. For instance, in that qualifications worker that I described, not only do they look for the criteria to be met within the patient's file, but can also trigger an automated fax to the physician's office to capture whatever criteria may be missing there, should it exist within the patient chart. They're doing it in a compliant fashion, they're doing it in an automated fashion.

They took some feedback to say it's not necessarily wise to send a single physician's office a high volume referral source, multiple faxes per day, because they've sent multiple patients per day, as those orders would be processed by humans, maybe different people that are processing the orders from the same office. You may theoretically have multiple faxes going back to the same referral source at the same day, which as you can imagine is quite annoying.

Tennr took it upon themselves to build a solution that rolled up those multiple or fax requests into a single request that can be scheduled. At a certain time throughout the day that would be at the convenience of the referral source and time that they want. It's those types of decisions and adaptations that I think are important. When they're doing that, it's a real deterrent for me to want to look elsewhere.

### Client Inquiry
**Client:**
Makes sense. Broadly with other AI solutions, how do you evaluate them? Why Armory, why not another one? What's that framework like? I'm just trying to understand for a new entrant in this market, how do they cut through this noise?

### Expert Response
**Expert:**
Yeah, it's difficult. They were also one of the early ones at some of these shows that we had done. It's like-minded to Tennr, to be honest with you. We did some demos, we did some tests in a development environment and was impressed with what they were capable of. That's how we came about. I've talked to competitors in that realm as well. There's a fairly well known one called Synthpop.

Unfortunately, as I evaluated Synthpop, they actually determined that our use case was a little too complex. I think it was the ask in terms of the products that we deal in and the depth in which we wanted some big calls to go. I think it was just a little too fringe for them and maybe outside their business model, looking for maybe a little bit more simplicity. In that case, Armory was able to build custom solutions for us that proved to be very valuable.

### Client Observation
**Client:**
Very interesting. A question we keep asking ourselves is that healthcare of course has not been typically the fastest adopter of technology, but I think with AI wave they using the charge. That seems quite strange. Across the board they're a lot more experimental, a lot more open to trying new things. What's the reason, as somebody who's part of these boardroom conversations?

### Expert Reflection
**Expert:**
I don't know that I have a direct answer for you. The pharmacy world has been accepting e-prescriptions for as long as I can remember. We're talking 30 years, 25 at least I would think. The DME industry has just been the worst of it to adopt to technology. I think that's because we've been behind these billing systems that aren't really integrated into any of the EMRs. We've been waiting for a connection piece to come about. I think the increase in API access has definitely assisted.

## Brightree Overview
Brightree it is, by a long shot, most common DME software. I would guess they have 70% of the market, if not more. They built a lot of solutions within their software to try to keep customers happy. I don't think they do any of it real well. There is a system that came along called Nico Health who was more open and accessible APIs. I think they fancy themselves as a core system that allowed access to a lot of outside vendors. I think that's shaken up the DME world at least to be a little bit more open minded.

I see Brightree getting more relaxed with the access that they allow companies like Tennr, or even Armory, or even the access that I can gain to write information from our website. We've got a connection built from our website and takes some patient data, etc. Yeah. I think there have just been a few shakeups and I don't know, maybe we've been behind so long we've finally woken up and now we've just gone full speed ahead.

## Client Inquiry
**Client:** Makes sense. Also from a labor takeout standpoint as well, is there any pressure in terms of improving operating margins across healthcare? This isn't specific to your company but is that one of the reasons why so many of these solutions that streamline labor budget and time from your full time employees is being explored.

## Expert Response
**Expert:** Yeah, you're spot on. It's definitely why there's so many companies looking at outsourcing. We have ever decreased in margins. Insurance companies get more and more aggressive about the prices that they set. We've got very little if any influence as of what those prices are actually set at. Meanwhile, you're getting squeezed by rising costs. In our industry, it truly is a service industry. Our margins even reflect it. Majority of our expenses on the labor side, it's usually not in the cost of goods. Yeah, as we get squeezed, it's the place you have to look.

## Client Follow-up
**Client:** Makes sense. Just trying to understand from you. You probably have conversations with your peers across DMEs and just generally, again, everybody adopting AI as aggressively or are you guys one of the forebears of this?

## Expert Insights
**Expert:** Not as aggressively. I'm seeing more people get open minded to it. When we started there weren't a whole lot that were interested in it. I think I've seen at least from talking with Tennr, I hear quite a bit of really big clients, sizable clients that are open-minded to it and are getting onboarded and integrated. I think at this point it's more commonly discussed. I attended a lot of these trade shows and hear more and more people at least getting comfortable with the idea. There's still quite a few that have not adopted it. I'm sure we'll get on board eventually because I don't see how they're to compete if they don't.

## Client Inquiry on Challenges
**Client:** Makes sense. Trying to just understand here, what's the top of mind problem for a lot of your peers? Is patient intake the number one problem or is it more prior auth?

## Expert Response on Challenges
**Expert:** Prior authorization is definitely a problem in our industry. It's very inefficient to do it. There's often discrepancies in the qualifications of those prior authorizations. I mentioned earlier about the qualifications worker and clinical justification of an order. You need to have that stuff prepared to obtain a prior authorization successfully. The whole point of a prior authorization, with some products if you don't obtain that information, you can bill it, theoretically get paid, but should you get audited and not have the information required, then you're going to get recouped.

The prior authorization is obviously what it sounds like. The point of it is to make sure that the patient is qualifying for the equipment prior to service being provided. There's quite a bit of labor that can go into that. Even if your products aren't necessarily prior auths, like ours mostly are not, you still need to have that information prepared and be organized.

# Document Content

That side of things is extremely time-consuming. It's imperfect science because there's a lot of interpretation involved there of what the actual criteria are intended for, what the justification is to meet the criteria. It's cumbersome and it goes back and forth quite a bit. The more you can leverage some automation to trim down fix pages of medical history notes, it's going to go a long way.

## Client
That makes sense. Just maybe the final few questions. Have you heard of this company called Coral in the same space?

## Expert
How do you spell?

## Client
Coral.

## Expert
No, I'm not familiar with that.

## Client
Got it. That's completely okay. Maybe the final question is how long are the sales cycles typically for this patient intake solution in organizations like yours? I understand varies quite significantly. Just broadly, what would a ballpark number be?

## Expert
Yeah, it really is product-specific. For instance, our breast pump patients, we may have a mom or a soon to be mom reach out to us when she first finds out she's pregnant at eight or nine weeks and sometimes.

## Expert
Selling into us?

## Client
Yes.

## Expert
It depends on the hoops your organization's got to jump through, I suppose to get approved for something like that. In our scenario where we fancy ourselves pretty quick decision-makers, but you obviously got to evaluate what it is they're throwing at you. Like I said, I think we started to talk to Tennr in May, early June, and signed on somewhere around July. In that case, you're looking at a month if something's of interesting.

## Client
Would you say that's quite accelerated versus traditional buying the timelines for organizations like yourself? A month sounds quite short.

## Expert
Yeah. I do think we're a bit more dynamic than your casual customer. If we see something we like, we're going to move pretty quickly. I evaluated Brightree, back in, I think it was 2018 when we eventually got on board with them coming off of a different DME billing service. That was probably more like a three- or four-month process.
