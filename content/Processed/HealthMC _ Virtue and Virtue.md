### Current State & Challenges

- Not confident about Q1 fundraising ability - planning cuts to extend runway
- RADV setbacks:
	- Had been putting significant BD emphasis into RADV deals
	- Humana won lawsuit against federal government on RADV extrapolation and lack of notice - decision likely to be appealed but timeline uncertain
	- Federal government shutdown compounded the impact
	- Ready-to-sign law firm deal now stalled - may restart in a month or may not
- Clover developments:
	- Won’t move forward on retro or quality work in Q4
	- Two reasons: other priorities + found items HealthMC missed on RADV audit
	- Shows platform not significantly ahead of Clover’s internal tech capabilities
- Good news: Render deal closing (small), significant platform progress with AI models improving week-over-week

### Financial Position & Strategic Pivot

- Current cash: $2.2M with $200-250K accounts receivable
- Current monthly burn: ~$250K, targeting reduction to $150-200K (20-40% cut)
- Need cuts to extend runway through end of next year for Q2/Q3 fundraise
- Business model shift: From services-heavy to platform-heavy approach
	- Services were becoming a crutch preventing tech solutions
	- Have existing contracts through year-end to complete
	- Cuts will be 3-6 people at low/high end
- Customer base status:
	- Gather (via Credo) wants to continue next year
	- PCC came through Credo - model needs clarification
	- Kirana: $15K AI-only paid pilot with expansion potential
	- Render: new, similar model to Kirana with potential large backend contract

### Payer Strategy & Market Learnings

- Must focus on payers vs providers - “big outcome is on payer side”
- Timeline goals:
	- Start meaningful payer discussions by end of year/Q1
	- Be in RFP processes by Q2
	- Want to raise on strength of payer traction in Q2/Q3
- Key lessons learned:
	- Took too much early BD emphasis, made work harder and required more ops
	- Should have stayed with 1-2 customers longer, figured out AI solutions first
	- Retro value is muted compared to few years ago - ROI lower even with hand coding
	- Being “best product” insufficient - every vendor claims 95-99% accuracy, payers use multiple vendors
- Go-to-market reset needed:
	- Stop pitching RADV, reset messaging for platform capabilities
	- Build more materials: blog posts, LinkedIn content, new demos, feature updates
	- Multi-channel approach beyond cold calling
	- Product/engineering must support BD with regular feature releases and demos
