## Slide 5

We're making it easy for your Chief **Cardiology** Officer, **Revenue** Cycle Manager, Registered **Dietitian**, Pop Health, and anyone else to say "Hey! I'd love to get notified if a patient's chart indicates X" & start checking for it with just a few prompts.
We are your AI partner. We co-develop screening flows on our platform with your SMEs, clinicians, and admins.

First, you tell us about a few of the core problems you're having. We can analyze clinical data for virtually any use case so it's likely we can support a majority of your flows. See some of our use cases here.

Once you decide on a use case, our AI team will join create a list of criteria to check for alongside your team. Whether that's your surgical centers discharge/transfer checklist, your malnutrition policies, or even your VBC contracts. We build, test, and deploy once everyone is satisfied.

## Slide 6

**We find gaps in clinical data to save live & make you millions.**

Healthcare organizations generate massive amounts of valuable clinical data. Yet, traditional approaches to extracting insights—manual reviews, limited nursing teams, and generic "AI" solutions—are expensive, inefficient, and miss critical revenue opportunities. Plus, you need 10+ vendors to handle the same foundational task, chart review, for different verticals (transplant screening, clinical trial legibility, denial mitigation, CMS compliance, patient quality, CDI, population health, etc.)

## Slide 7: The Platform - Overview

**The Platform - Overview**

Autopilots are custom workflows anyone can build. For example, a radiology department may decide they'd like to set up an autopilot to detect patients who require a follow-up for lung cancer CT. First, the radiology department and our AI team set up their custom rules (criteria) like nodule size, morphology, lesions, lung RADs, etc. Then, the AI will analyze the entire patient's chart (all data) & surface all relevant patients by risk.

## Slide 8: Albany Med Health System | Do Not Share

**Albany Med Health System | Do Not Share**

For their first autopilot, ALBANY MED wanted to check their home care clinical documentation for regulatory compliance. They had a large staff of FTEs dedicated to reviewing notes but couldn't review more than 10% per day.

We spent less than 3 months from conversation to deployment. At the point of deployment, we took on 100% of their review operations, scaled the quantity, and caught 5x as many errors.

It's been less than a year & we've already saved 1 department $1M+/yr.

We converted regulatory, state, and contract standard into rules within our platform. Spent a few weeks with their current team to replicate their processes & deployed a better solution for the future of their company. We're now working on more use cases & have dozens of newly live autopilots.

## Slide 9: Working with DART

**Working with DART**

1.  Boots on the ground - our team of engineers & data scientists will work with your team to identify areas where the DART platform can help. In person, next to your team - with coffee & donuts of course!
2.  Run Pilot - we scope & run a pilot so you can get a taste of what we can do.
3.  Measure ROI - based on the pilot results, we'll measure ROI opportunities for your entire system
4.  Plan Onboarding - you'll sign on & we'll lay out the plan to kick things off!
5.  Run Deployments - if you want 1 or 100 flows, we'll do rollouts, one by one, ensuring success, our team is with you the whole time.
6.  Scale - whenever you have new ideas & opportunities, we're a phone call away.

## Slide 10: Why Dart?

**Why Dart?**

Our models can take feedback & actually learn from their almost instantly.

Our on-site engineers work closely to customize models on your last 100 denials, cardio cases, or whatever use case you have.

Our on-site clinicians, work closely with your SME to outline needs, goals, and ideas.

We invest heavily in AI education at each facility. Our goal is to supercharge everyone.

| Foundational Model Providers | In-Your-Cloud Model Providers | Self Hosted Open Models |
| :--------------------------- | :---------------------------- | :---------------------- |
| OpenAI                       | Microsoft Azure OpenAI        | LLAMA 2                 |
| ANTHROPIC                    | Vertex AI                     | MISTRAL AI 8X7          |

We also work closely with organizations to fine-tune models, deploy foundational AI, and other model types (embeddings, vision, etc). Our system has guardrails built in place & tools to help prevent hallucinations & speed through debugging.
Need a specific imaging, quality, or other workflow? We can train & deploy a custom model for you (within your firewall)! We have a network of thousands of clinical labelers (based in the US).

## Slide 12: Other Use Cases

**Other Use Cases**

*   Care managers quickly find out which patients are eligible for hospital-at-home/home health to reduce LOS & readmissions.
*   RD see patients that are high risk for malnutrition, live, and intervene.
*   A trauma center LOS taskforce uses our system to move patients to the right level of care to reduce refusals.
