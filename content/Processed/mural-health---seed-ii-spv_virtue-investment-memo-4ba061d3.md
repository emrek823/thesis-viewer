## Executive Summary

Sam Whitaker (CEO) founded Mural Health to build a better version of his previous company - Greenphire - that sold to Thoma Bravo for $1.1B in 2021. Given Mural Health's progress and traction over the last 18 months, Sam proposed investing $3M of his own capital in a Seed-II to double down and grow his ownership because of his conviction in the business. This is not a typical seed-II financing where the company wants to raise a seed extension because of concerns around raising a Series A. Mural has already received interest from tier-1 Series A investors to lead a Series A ($60M+ pre-money based on comps and early conversations) but wants to drive through key milestones over the next 1-2 years and drive a real step-change in valuation. Our working relationship with Sam and the Mural Health team has given us exclusive access and the opportunity to invest in this round alongside Sam, Bessemer (who led the Seed), and key strategic investors (McKesson Ventures).

Mural Health hit the commercial goals laid out at the seed, exceeded our expectations on initial product engagement, and pulled forward additional product development beyond patient payments quicker than expected. Over the last 18 months, Mural has reached $2.5M in bookings, shown best-in-class patient engagement (98% for 2,000 patients), and built a strong pipeline with a clear path to $8M+ in bookings by 2024 and $14M+ by 2025.

Customer feedback and product development to-date has given us even more confidence that Mural Health can expand horizontally across the clinical trial participant experience (eCOA, observational studies, etc) to tap into the $10B+ eClinical market. Mural Health has already received a $100M+ acquisition offer from Advarra (acquired by Blackstone) and we are bullish on the highly acquisitive pharma tech and services space, especially for a high-gross margin (70%-80%) product like Mural Health's.

This financing is unique not only because Sam is doubling down himself and personally investing $3M, but we have the opportunity to get at a reduced valuation to a Series A financing for a round that helps them hit Series B/C milestones ($10M+ revenue, 2x YoY growth). When we have a front row seat to early signals of success for product and sales oriented teams building healthcare SaaS businesses in large markets, we are aggressive to get as much ownership as possible. Mural has established PMF (e.g., does the world want to pay for the product we created?) and is ready for international, scalable, and sustainable growth.

We are excited to invest $2M through an SPV to support Mural in its goal to hit $20M+ in bookings within 24 months, continue to displace Greenphire and become the market leader in the clinical trial patient payments space, and develop additional product functionality across the participant journey to create a category leader in the $10B eClinical Market. We are confident that Mural CEO, Sam Whitaker, can replicate similar Greenphire success which sold to Thoma Bravo for $1.1B in 2021 after only raising <$10M VC.

## Product

Mural launched Mural Link - its initial participant-facing mobile app and biopharma-facing platform for trial payments and logistics - in June 2023, and the company has already seen 98.9% engagement across 2,000+ patients. This engagement proved out the core product assumption of payments as a wedge, and the company is already executing on its product roadmap to expand horizontally across the participant experience.

### Core Product Strategy Proven:
Mural's current product addresses the core problems of clinical trial recruitment that costs $40K - $80K per patient: enrollment (80% of studies are delayed by recruitment), retention (30% of participants dropout), and diversity (80% of participants in the US are white).

The key features that differentiate Mural Health's product include today from Greenphire and other competitors include many areas that are non-obvious, nuanced, and a direct result of Sam's experience in the space, including:
*   No participant fees
*   Participant controls payment method
*   Multi-option payment delivery
*   Data stored in country of origin
*   Participant controls and data workflows
*   Participant insights to drive engagement and retention.

These advantages compound over time and create direct improvements in engagement and retention, which then drive further ROI for sponsors, CROs and sites.

**Mural Health Product Screenshots (Jan-24)**
*   The document includes screenshots of the Mural Health product, showing a payment transfer interface (e.g., $1.00 via PayPal), participant insights dashboard (e.g., Experience Rating Trend), and a reimbursement request form, and an Uber booking interface for rides.

## Single Platform to Manage All Participant Interactions
Using patient payments as a wedge into a broader, horizontal platform that controls all participant interactions was a major hypothesis during the initial seed financing. Mural has now validated that hypothesis and already begun to add more features to its platform across the participant journey (below), starting with enrollment to study completion. Mural leverages the same mobile-app and the same UI with high patient engagement and continues to layer on features that expand its reach and overall TAM.

## Commercial

After only 8 months of selling, Mural has validated PMF across a diverse customer base to reach $2.5M in bookings, and created a strong pipeline to scale to ~$8M in bookings in 2024 and ~$15M in 2025 with patient payments alone. Mural has taken business away from Greenphire, gained large pharma trust and momentum, and secured key wins amongst its top customer groups (large pharma, small/mid pharma, sites, CROs).

### PMF Established in 6 Months across Diverse Customer Types:
Mural sells to sponsors through direct and channel sales on a per study basis (average TCV = $140K for 30 month study) and direct to sites/universities with an enterprise software license ($60K TCV per site; $250K TCV per university). As a pure software product, Mural has 80% gross margins, which will only scale over time with more features. Mural has closed 15 contracts to-date and built a high-quality, predictable pipeline (average contract length 30 months) of $23.2M to execute on in 2024 and beyond.

## Future Growth: Deeper in Patient Payments + Broader eClinical Expansion

To hit its $8.5M bookings goal in 2024, Mural has MSA's fully executed / committed with large biopharma customers (BMS, Lilly, Genentech), is in contracting negotiations with multiple large sites (Kaiser, Stanford), and is in multiple RFIs with a number of other large pharma customers (CSL Behring, Moderna, AbbVie, Merck, Novartis) that make up it's $23.2M gross pipeline.

Horizontal expansion across the participant experience only provides additional upside. As shown below, the initial patient payments TAM (based on Greenphire ClinCard penetration to-date) is $1.3B. Mural can tap into the broader eClinical market ($10-$12B total) with its expansion across different product lines that it has already begun and that customers are pulling Mural into. This upside and potential expansion has always been a hypothesis for Mural since its founding, but product development has been pulled ahead of schedule because of this customer interest. We have additional confidence because of the 98% engagement we have seen with Mural Link - something that we haven't seen for any clinical trial technology to-date. Mural has earned the right to become the next-gen leader in the eClinical space ($10B -$12B TAM) that focuses and begins with patients, rather than the historical players (Veeva, Medidata, IQVIA) which historically focused on back-end technology for sponsors and CROs.

## Financing

$12M gets Mural Health to $20M+ in bookings and $10M+ in annual revenue. This financing is unique not only because Sam is doubling down himself and personally investing $3M, but we have the opportunity to get at a reduced valuation to a Series A financing for a round that helps them hit Series C milestones ($10M+ revenue, 2x YoY growth).

### Projections:
All current revenue projections are based on Mural Link Base product (live), US tax (live), international tax (in development), and expanded travel (in development), and does not include any potential upside from the horizontal product expansion shown above. Key assumptions / variables across the P&L that we dissected include:

*   **Revenue:** Management built their projections from a bottoms-up sales model based on TCV on current product capabilities (Mural Link base, US/international tax, and expanded travel) and conservative assumptions around customer penetration. Average TCV is assumed to be only $135K conservatively (which is less than TCV average to-date). Eli Lily, for example, has 40 potential studies and management is assuming they only capture 4 (10%), which is conservative given feedback against Greenphire and other players to-date.

*   **Gross margins:** Gross margins scale from 79% to 84% over time. Mural has a 9-person engineering team that has built a process and platform to scale efficiently over time and reduce technical debt. The team model is split into a "feature team (UX, new features, data / reporting) and "platform team" (vendor integrations, stability, streaming data) that is responsible for R&D and additional deployments.

*   **OpEx:** We compare revenue vs. OpEx and bookings vs. S&M expense to evaluate how Mural will scale over the next 2-3 years with its current sales and product foundation. In 2024, revenue is 22% of OpEx, which evolves to 61% in 2025 and 105% in 2026. In addition, S&M expenses remain relatively flat ($1.68M in 2024 to $2.4M in 2026) as bookings ramp from $8.5M to $23.6M.

**Virtue Analysis**

We quantify the different exit scenarios and timelines below to emphasize a few key points on how we think about the trajectory of the business using a theoretical $2M investment in this current round.

| Post-money Valuation | $39,500,000 |
| :------------------- | :----------- |
| Assume $2M Investment | $2,000,000 |
| Initial Ownership | 5.1% |

| Scenario | Total Raised | Exit Value | Probability | Years | Additional Dilution | Gross Proceeds | Multiple |

| $30M in revenue and exit to Veeva, Medidata, McKesson, ThermoFisher or other strategic common in pharma-tech | $19.50M | $300M | 30% | 4 | 0% | $15.19M | 7.59x |
| Next-gen Greenphire with 50% of current revenue (Greenphire currently at $100M ARR) | $39.50M | $500M | 15% | 5 | 20% | $20.25M | 10.13x |
| Next-gen leader in patient-facing clinical trial solutions | $59.50M | $1,000M | 5% | 7 | 40% | $30.38M | 15.19x |
| **Probability Weighted** | | | | | | | **6.08x** |

**Virtue Analysis**

*   **Capital-efficient Growth:** We have high confidence that Mural can reach ~$30M in revenue without any additional capital after this round.

*   **Early Acquisition Interest:** The early acquisition interest from Advarra ($100M offer with basically no revenue) and Sam's connections and cache in the space give us confidence in a worst-case scenario where growth stalls.

*   **Clear Playbook for Strategic Acquisition:** Pharma tech is unique compared to payer and provider because of the number of $300-$500M deals in the space and acquisitive nature of these strategics (some of who are investors in this round).

*   **Greenphire Comp:** Greenphire is at ~$100M in ARR and Mural is already stealing wallet share from Greenphire prior after their product has been on the market <12 months. Per multiple conversations with Sam, Mural is ~18 months ahead of Greenphire at a similar early stage of development. We have also had feedback from Greenphire personnel that would suggest Greenphire views Mural is their main, direct competitive threat to their core business for the foreseeable future.

*   **Big Vision to Own Participant Experience:** Veeva, Medidata, and many other companies have demonstrated the potential for clinical trial companies to scale to $1B+ in enterprise value. Mural has the potential to do the same but starting with the patient experience that is core to Mural and the company's DNA.

## Risks

Despite our excitement around Mural, the traction to-date, and the market that Mural Health is targeting, we have worked to identify key risks to the business and subsequent mitigation strategies to get comfortable with the growth of a seed-stage business.

*   **ACV Expansion:** Mural Health's ACV is ~$50K to-date and given the nature of Mural Health's contracts (30 months; $25K setup costs), the bookings to revenue ratio is 20% in 2024, 40% in 2025, and 48% in 2026. As mentioned above, these projections are conservative in our mind and we see a path to 7-figure ACVs with multiple current clients. Projections currently assume no revenue from products already in development or live beyond Mural Link (expanded travel, US Tax, International Tax) that bring ACVs closer to $100K. Projections also assume a very conservative conversion rate on total number of trials a sponsor has ongoing. Lily, for example, has 40 potential trials currently and Mural assumes only capturing 10%, which should grow to closer to 30-50% over time based on Lily feedback. Mural can also upsell additional features at end of 2024 and beginning of 2025 (caregiver support, eCOA, eConsent, etc) that are priced around $100K-$200K per trial.

*   **Product Expansion:** Mural can continue to build a better Greenphire and steal market share from his former company doing $100M ARR and build a good-to-great-business. What we are underwriting and gets us excited is the potential to go beyond patient payments and own the entire participant experience. There is a risk that product development for these new features (caregiver support, eCOA, eConsent) moves slower than planned. Mural must also improve its GTM, sales process, and customer success to continue to upsell these features to customers (a la Veeva). We are encouraged and bullish on the ability for Mural to execute here because customers are already pulling them into these areas at a pace much faster than Sam expected based on his Greenphire experience.

*   **Competition:** Greenphire is the obvious large competitor, but there are also other clinical trial platforms (Veeva, Medidata, Medable, etc) that could theoretically develop a patient payments solution and CTMS platforms and recruitment companies also offer patient payments solutions given their interactions with sites and patients. Greenphire is handicapped by the classic innovator's dilemma because competing with Mural Health on providing a no-fee option fundamentally undercuts one of their major revenue streams. Greenphire is also under pressure from Thoma Bravo to cut costs and drive sales so product innovation has stalled over the last 5 years. Other players in the space could launch a barebones payments competitor, but lack the nuance and sophistication that Sam brings with his unique earned insights to focus on areas like international tax, no fee offerings, and the vision to expand beyond patient payments. Even if these competitors copy Mural after 1-2 years, the engagement and retention metrics that Mural will have shown creates a "snowball effect of ROI” that allow them to take those results and win deals with new customers and upsell existing customers.
