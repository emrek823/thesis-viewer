## Slide 2: Executive Summary

RIGHT.

*   We have built a **genAI software platform** to disrupt the $81B clinical research industry by eliminating the biopharma-to-trial site bottleneck
*   **Founders with multiple exits** in tech and life sciences, team includes leaders with deep experience in software, medical practice, and clinical research
*   Expanding on our playbook and platform from Deep Lens (successful exit 2022) to drive rapid adoption, ramp revenue, and build an **insurmountable network moat** with low friction. **If Deep Lens had Generative AI => 10X**
*   **Proof of Life:** Platform was released in January 2024; already signed **5 paid SaaS deals** ($420K ARR) and **4 strategic partnerships**
*   Closed $4.25M pre-seed SAFE note mid 2023, now raising **$10M Series A Q2 2024**

## Slide 3: Huge TAM, disruptable by GenAI

RIGHT.

(Pie Chart Data)
**GLOBAL CLINICAL TRIAL MARKET SIZE, 2023: $81B**
*   Pharmaceutical & Biopharmaceutical Companies: ~$55B (approx. visual estimation)
*   Medical Device Companies: ~$15B (approx. visual estimation)
*   Others: ~$11B (approx. visual estimation)

Labor accounts for **80%-95%** of a clinical trial's direct costs.
Most of it can be improved with Generative AI

Including..
*   Administrative staff costs
*   Site overhead
*   Site selection
*   Eligible patients' identification
*   Data management & validation
*   Patient enrollment
*   Site & patient retention
*   Site audits and monitoring
*   Overall operational efficiency

**What are the warning signs for metabolic syndrome?**
The warning signs for metabolic syndrome include:
1.  Abdominal obesity: waist circumference greater than 102 cm (men) or greater than 88 cm (women) according to NCEP definition, or greater than 94 cm (men) or greater than 80 cm (women) according to IDF definition.
2.  Insulin resistance: Blood glucose levels greater than 5.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) or drug treatment for elevated blood glucose.
3.  Dyslipidemia: Low levels of HDL cholesterol (less than 1.03 mmol/L in men or less than 1.29 mmol/L in women) or high levels of triglycerides (greater than 1.7 mmol/L or 150 mg/dL) or drug treatment for low HDL cholesterol or elevated triglycerides.
4.  Hypertension: Blood pressure levels greater than 130/85 mmHg or drug treatment for hypertension. It is important to note that different organizations may have slightly different criteria for defining metabolic syndrome, but these are the common warning signs.

*Upgrade to Enterprise*

**[Main Content Area]**
**◎ Write an informed consent form for a clinical trial. Use the protocol document provided. Work section by section starting with the risks and benefits section. Write in an approachable tone and at a high school reading level.**

**Informed Consent Form**
**Title of Study:** A Randomized, Open-Label, Controlled, Multi-Center Phase II/III Study to Assess the Efficacy and Safety of BND2998 vs. Standard of Care Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (Erlotinib or Gefitinib) as First Line Treatment in Patients with Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Mutation Positive Advanced Non Small Cell Lung Cancer with Central Nervous System Metastasis
**Protocol Number:** CDF7427-987
**Principal Investigator:** [Insert Name]
**Introduction:**
You are being invited to participate in a clinical trial to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of a new treatment called BND2998 compared to the standard treatment for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with central nervous system (CNS) metastasis. This study aims to determine if BND2998 can improve progression-free survival (PFS) compared to the standard treatment.
**Purpose of the Study:**
The primary objective of this study is to determine if administration of single agent BND2998 compared to the standard of care (SoC) epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) as first-line therapy results in a significant increase in PFS in patients with EGFR mutation positive advanced NSCLC with CNS metastasis. Secondary objectives include assessing safety, objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), duration of response (DoR), overall survival (OS), health-related quality of life (HRQoL), neurological function, and exploring genetic and proteomic markers.
**Risks and Benefits:**
There are potential risks and benefits associated with participating in this study. The risks include possible side effects from the study drug, BND2998, such as nausea, diarrhea, skin rash, and changes in blood counts. There is also a risk of disease progression or worsening of symptoms. Additionally, there may be risks associated with the study procedures, such as blood tests and imaging scans.
The potential benefits of participating in this study include the possibility of receiving a new treatment that may be more effective than the standard treatment. You will also receive close monitoring of your condition by a team of healthcare professionals. Your participation will contribute to the advancement of medical knowledge and potentially benefit future patients with NSCLC.
**Confidentiality:**
Your personal information and medical records will be kept confidential and will only be accessible to authorized study personnel. Your identity will be protected by assigning a unique study identification number to all study-related documents.
**Voluntary Participation:**
Participation in this study is voluntary, and you have the right to withdraw at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled. Your decision to participate or withdraw will not affect your current or future medical care.

## Slide 22: Case study: Extracting value from unstructured data

RIGHT.

**The Challenge:**
Billions of medical test results in a semi-structured format. High-value genomics test records are stored in text fields without annotation; extracting insight is currently manual

**Our Approach:**
Ryght created a custom extraction pipeline to identify genes included in each test, identify variants, list findings in a table, and surface relevant medical literature for the analyst based on the clinically relevant variants identified.

**[Screenshot Text Content]**

**High level Tumor Mutation Burden was detected in this patient X2019 s sample and microsatellite instability was NOT detected in this patient X2019 s sample.**
Presence of T >10 mutations / megabase has been reported to be therapeutically predictive of favorable clinical outcomes and responsiveness to immune checkpoint inhibitors, according to some studies (29658845). TMB is an evolving biomarker, and consensus standardization for this biomarker remains an ongoing imperative (30664300). To date, the median T[I] Onco Advanced in general, is appro[x] megabase. According to some larg[e] primary literature, a median TMB va[lue] has been reported for all general tu[mors] (28420421).
The present sample analysis is also microsatellite instability.

**TP53 p.Asn247lle** (Selected as a variant)

**Variant Description:**
The genomic variant p.N247I is a variant in the TP53 gene. The TP53 gene is a tumor suppressor gene that plays a critical role in preventing the development of cancer. Mutations in TP53 are associated with a variety of cancers, including breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and lung cancer.
The rsID for the variant p.N247I is rs786201762. This variant has been mentioned in 63 research articles.
The clinical significance of the p.N247I variant is uncertain. It has been classified as both "uncertain-significance" and "likely-pathogenic" in different studies. Further research is needed to determine the exact impact of this variant on cancer risk and prognosis.
In the context, there are several conditions mentioned related to cancer including breast cancer colorectal cancer and lung cancer

## Slide 23: Case study: Extracting value from unstructured data

RIGHT.

**The Outcome:**
Accelerated response time for queries on key patient cohorts. Client now handling a greater volume of queries without staff increases, improving gross margin for their business.

**The Opportunity:**
Creating structure from unstructured patient data unlocks value from previously unusable data.
