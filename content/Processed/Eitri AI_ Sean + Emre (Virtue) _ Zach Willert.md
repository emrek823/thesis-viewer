### Zach Willert’s Background and Motivations

- Career progression: Software engineer → Data science (prefers this)
	- Toast, then Klaviyo for experience with smart people at big organizations
	- Currently at Series A fintech startup (18 people, NYC)
	- Seeking more ownership, autonomy, and technical challenges
- Previous startup experience and entrepreneurial goals
	- Wants to own complicated tech stacks and take leadership role
	- Attracted to ground floor opportunity with Eitri to define technical solutions

### Technical Assessment and Market Opportunity

- Zach’s perspective on Quinn and Eitri:
	- Impressed by Quinn’s solo achievements and methodical approach
	- Excited about technical challenges, especially PDF scanning accuracy problem
	- Need to build more accurate system than anything on market
	- Next phase: AI systems to analyze data and surface insights
- Market timing (“why now?”):
	- Increasing drug complexity beyond small molecules (ADCs, cell/gene therapy)
	- More outsourcing to specialized CDMOs
	- China dynamics driving onshoring/reshoring decisions
	- Legacy systems (LIMS, MES, electronic lab notebooks) haven’t delivered real AI solutions
- Competitive landscape sparse:
	- Major players: Veeva, Benchling, MasterControl
	- Some edge solutions like Apprentice.io (VR approach during COVID)
	- Most other companies focus on biological innovation rather than software

### Business Strategy and Near-Term Goals

- Market size and revenue model:
	- CDMO market: $250B+ within $400B biomanufacturing market
	- High-value contracts: minimum high six-figure ACVs (not $10-50K deals)
	- Global opportunity beyond US healthcare system quirks
- Key focus areas for pre-seed phase:
	- Nail the wedge: batch record review, tech transfer, process deviation
	- Scale to both BioPharma and CDMOs (avoid narrow bucketing)
	- Show initial value through retrospective use cases
- Next 12-18 months milestones:
	- Secure 2 partners: 1 CDMO + 1 BioPharma (already have Skylark as partial)
	- Build credible pipeline with meaningful conversion
	- 2-3 technical hires focused on talent density over headcount
	- ~$1M ARR target (though quality of revenue more important than threshold)
