### Alfredo’s Background & Approach

- EE + CS @ MIT, then moved to NYC for NGO work
- NGO acquired by UNICEF → worked at UN Secretariat (emerging tech)
- Currently at insurance startup leading payments team
- Seeking next role with more autonomy, creativity, product architecture from ground-up
- Philosophy on data extraction: “throw the sink at it initially, then optimize”
	- Use OCR for tables, ML models for handwritten text
	- Modular approach: right tool for right job
	- Example: OCR to separate typed vs handwritten, then targeted models for each

### Etri Investment Thesis & Opportunity

- Virtue’s pharma tech focus: solutions/services/data products (not therapeutics)
- Met Quinn summer 2024, backed him after methodical idea validation process
- Key investment drivers:
	- Founder-market fit: Quinn’s chemistry background + detail-oriented approach matches VP bioprocess buyers
	- Market timing: $300-350B biomanufacturing spend, bringing manufacturing back to US (biosecure)
	- Revenue driver not just cost savings: manufacturing IS the product for complex biologics
- Target customers: CDMOs with 30% EBITDA margins, sticky contracts

### Vision & Concerns

- 6-month/1-year goal: nail the wedge, sign biopharma + CDMOs, build extensible platform
- Alfredo most excited about: orchestration of 20+ modular tools as optimization problem
	- Balance speed vs cost (extract in 10 minutes for 3x cost vs 1 day standard)
	- Graph theory approach to resource optimization
- Main concern: balancing platform scalability vs nailing one wedge perfectly
- Quinn’s vision: Etri as “connecting tissue” between novel therapy designers and manufacturers
