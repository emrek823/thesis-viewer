### Virtue Investment Strategy

- Healthcare generalist at seed stage, $100M+ AUM across two funds
- Focus areas (expanding beyond traditional care delivery):
- AI-native/enabled mandate: Nearly 100% of recent investments
- Performance metrics: Top 5% quarterly, near 100% Series A graduation

### Pharma Commercialization Opportunities

- Real Chemistry transformation: IR/PR → modern pharma commercialization platform
- Market dynamics: Pharma procurement teams prioritizing AI (often without context)
- Solstice Health raising Series A
	- Originally sold to agencies, now direct pharma approach
	- Sean meeting with team in 2 hours
- Limited venture competition in pharma commercialization space
	- Lack of deep sector understanding among VCs
	- Potential partnership opportunities between New Mountain portfolio and Virtue companies

### Market Observations & Next Steps

- Structural challenges in venture market
	- Wide seed funnel, dramatic Series A/B narrowing
	- Low graduation rates continuing 3+ years
	- Strong businesses may not get venture love at later stages
- Partnership framework established
	- New Mountain interested in Solstice introduction/potential investment
	- Ongoing dialogue for future collaboration opportunities
	- Precedent set with successful Smarter outcome
