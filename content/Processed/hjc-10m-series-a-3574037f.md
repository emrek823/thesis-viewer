## Slide 6: The real problem

Confidential and Privileged

The real
problem

“It is impossible to understand
addiction without asking what
relief the addict finds, or hopes to
find, in the drug or the addictive
behaviour.

The question is not why the
addiction, but why the pain.”

**Dr. Gabor Mate, MD**

“What if depression is, in fact, a form
of grief—for our own lives not being
as they should? What if it is a form
of grief for the connections we have
lost, yet still need?

You aren't a machine with broken
parts. You are an animal whose
needs are not being met.”

**Johann Hari, Lost Connections**

## Slide 7: Hero Journey Club

Hero Journey Club

generationally-competent

Top message: "Lyte 06/06/2022 Today's General Advice Share we will explore cognitive dissonance and self worth"
Content: "Cognitive dissonance occurs when our beliefs do not align with our actions. For example, maybe you believe smoking is deadly, but you continue to smoke and rationalize it with another thought such as "But it calms me when I'm angry." This can work in other ways as well. Maybe you really enjoy riding water rides at a theme park, but your friends are not interested, so you justify not riding them by thinking "It's not fun to walk around in wet clothes anyway." So what do we do? We can -Change the belief (such as now believing "I don't like water rides") -Change our action (Ride the ride anyway) -Rationalize our decision (like the example) Changing beliefs can take time and changing our actions can feel daunting, so oftentimes we rationalize. This can bring some comfort, but it is not always the best decision long term, and it can lower our self esteem. Sometimes changing the belief or the action (though it takes time) can really improve our self esteem. Deep Dive Link for Further Reading https://www.berkeleywellbeing.com/cognitive-dissonance.html"

something- making sure I am actually in the right

Top message: "Lyte 06/06/2022 Today's General Advice Share we will explore cognitive dissonance and self worth"
Content: "Cognitive dissonance occurs when our beliefs do not align with our actions. For example, maybe you believe smoking is deadly, but you continue to smoke and rationalize it with another thought such as "But it calms me when I'm angry." This can work in other ways as well. Maybe you really enjoy riding water rides at a theme park, but your friends are not interested, so you justify not riding them by thinking "It's not fun to walk around in wet clothes anyway." So what do we do? We can -Change the belief (such as now believing "I don't like water rides") -Change our action (Ride the ride anyway) -Rationalize our decision (like the example) Changing beliefs can take time and changing our actions can feel daunting, so oftentimes we rationalize. This can bring some comfort, but it is not always the best decision long term, and it can lower our self esteem. Sometimes changing the belief or the action (though it takes time) can really improve our self esteem. Deep Dive Link for Further Reading https://www.berkeleywellbeing.com/cognitive-dissonance.html"

Mental health DnD “campaigns” for skill development

**Wizard's Creed**
HERO JOURNEY CLUB

**Wizard Journeying Style**
The curiosity of the Wizard sharpens
their ability to examine thoughts
without "buying in" to them. They
find themselves saying one thing,
then another that is the complete
opposite, without worrying about
the inconsistency.

**Wizards Strive to:**
* Develop an appreciation for the ines-
capable influence of the words they
use on themselves and on others
* Resist the temptation to bring all of
experience under the control of
thought and language
* Find ways to bring talk into aware-
ness without allowing it to dominate
their sense of what is real, right, and
wrong

"The enemy of magic is thinking.
The more powerful the thought, the
weaker the magic.

Mental health DnD “campaigns" for skill development

**Monk**
HERO JOURNEY CLUB

**Introduction**
The Monks of Hero's Hall study
the art of 'sitting in fire' and
being taught at the feet of their
feelings. They are no strangers to
discomfort and may often come
from a difficult and challenging
past. They first 'seek the fire'
through learning about their
emotions and then gradually
practice giving themselves over
to their instruction. They become
the wisest of us as a result of
their art, self-compassion, and
patience. They learn a profound
truth that fire burns colder the
longer they sit with it.

"Feelings can't be ignored, no matter
how unjust or ungrateful they seem"
Anne Frank, Monk of Captivity

**Monk's Creed**
HERO JOURNEY CLUB

**Monk Journeying Style**
Monks are rarely in a hurry.
Emotions unfold slowly, especially
into awareness, and also depart
slowly. Monks have learned to
adapt their sense of urgency to this
unavoidable internal dynamic.

**Monks Strive to:**
* Remember that although over-
whelming at times, fully feeling their
emotions will serve them better than
pushing them down or avoiding them.
* Simply talking about feelings, what
led up to them, and what they feel like
is often the most effective way to
begin.
* The more concrete and specific the
description in session, the more evoca-
tive the feelings will be, and the more
healing they enjoy.

"Only by observation and practice do
we learn that self-mastery is no
mastery at all."
Ordos the Wise

**Class Skills**
HERO JOURNEY CLUB

**Skill 1 - Inner Eye**
Expanding Emotional Awareness
In this skill you will learn how to tease emotions
apart to address them with greater success.
*My Focus:* Shade your progress: (Progress bar with 5 segments, 2 filled)

**Skill 2 - Judging the Strats**
Uncover Emotions from Actions
Increase awareness of your emotions by
examining what leads up to them and
how you react in key moments.
*My Focus:* Shade your progress: (Progress bar with 5 segments, 3 filled)

**Skill 3 - Battle Fortitude**
Emotional Tolerance and Validation
Staying in the present moment with your
feelings is a difficult but critical skill that
will benefit you over and over again.
*My Focus:* Shade your progress: (Progress bar with 5 segments, 2 filled)

**Skill 4 - Pulling Aggro**
Choosing to Take On Some Heat
There are likely situations you have been
avoiding. In this skill, you will slowly start
seeking them out.
*My Focus:* Shade your progress: (Progress bar with 5 segments, 4 filled)

**Skill 5 - Spotting Emotional Tripwires**
The Wisdom to Know the Difference
Not every source of distress should be
handled with emotion regulation skills.
Learning when you can and should
change the situation, and when you
can't, will build your wisdom and health.
*My Focus:* Shade your progress: (Progress bar with 5 segments, 3 filled)

Journeyer Love
We're more than just mental health
support, we're a place to belong.

"I've been here for a while and I've really enjoyed
everything you're doing here. It's helped more
than any 1x1 therapy I've tried so far honestly.
I've just been trying to get my depression under
control. I struggle a lot, but I find myself looking
forward to these sessions every week."

**Beignet Boo** recommends Hero Journey Club. Jun 11
I've been an active member of HJC since I first joined the
public Discord in February 11th, 2022. I was curious to see
if it was actually good or not, and was surprised to see it
was filled with genuine, hardworking people who cared
tremendously about the well-being of others, regardless if
you were a paying member. I'm 17 years old, kind of in the
beginning of my "coming of age" stage and currently trying
to not let C-PTSD control my life anymore. These people
have been the best support I've ever had. They've held
hundreds of clinical journey groups as well as dozens of
fun public community quests/events, so just so it's out
there, these people really do care. (And they're also very
professional.)

Not only have I gotten great advice, helpful resources, and
valuable mental health information, I definitely feel like I'm
a stronger, more stable individual since joining. I'm
incredibly grateful that I get to be a part of HJC. :-) To
those struggling mentally, emotionally, or socially, maybe
give HJC a shot. The community is absolutely wonderful
and welcoming. We're pretty chill.

**Allie Renee** recommends Hero Journey Club. Jun 6
HJC has honestly been life changing for me. I'd never
found a therapist I've connected with so well before and
I've never had the experience of a therapeutic community
like this one before. I've felt significantly better since
starting sessions with them and can actually feel some of
my less than beneficial habits finally loosening their grip.
Honestly couldn't recommend the fantastic humans who
run HJC more!

**Ainsley Stevielle**
I absolutely love Hero Journey Club! I have my
second session today, but even just being in the
discord server is so so helpful. Everyone works
really hard to make it a welcoming space and as
someone who tends to lurk in servers, I've
actually had a lot of good interactions there and
I tend to put myself out there more! I highly
recommend them to anyone considering it

**Eric James**
This is literally one of the best ideas that have
surfaced recently. Players can feel engaged in
an activity they find comforting while also taking
steps to improve mental health and coping
mechanisms. I love this.

**Izzy Truly**
I've been doing therapy with Hero Journey Club
for a couple months now. The therapists are
amazing and the people in my group super cool.
I'd put off looking into therapy for ages because
of my social anxiety but I figured this was
something I could handle. I'm so happy I did. If
you're thinking about it I definitely recommend
giving them a shot. It's honestly helping me a lot
and it's lot more affordable than most other
therapy options
