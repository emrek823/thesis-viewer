**Q: Please elaborate on your ability to speak to:**
1. Your involvement in procurement decisions for healthcare technology solutions.
2. How you assess or influence improvements in patient experience through the adoption of new technologies, such as AI medical scribe solutions.
A: 1. Highly influential, but not the final decision-maker.
2. The biggest thing is how to move the needle with provider experience, impacting patient experience. Working with doctor solutions to help patients is, I think, important. The question is which companies have the leg up on this. This is where products can distinguish themselves.

**Client**
Thanks for taking the time. We're looking to understand the scribe market a bit better, but more specifically how scribes are being used in acute care and emergency medicine and some of the idiosyncrasies and unique pain points that might be here as opposed to broader setting that Abridge and Ambience are more deployed in. Would maybe first love to learn a little bit more about you, your role at Vituity, the org, and also your current hospital. It looks like you're still practicing as well, so we'd love to just hear a little bit more about what you're up to.

**Expert**
Absolutely. I'm an emergency physician, board certified. I've been in practice now for about 15-ish years. I've been with Vituity the entire time. I worked at probably 18-19 different hospitals in various capacities, medical directors, CMIO roles. Most recently however, I am at a hospital in California, as you mentioned, as the medical director there. Part of that was at Sequoia and actually that was my first experience with some of these AI scribe things. I actually looked at Abridge very early on. I think they were still in their Series A.

At that time, obviously, they had a good product but it was still very, very early on. Sequoia didn't feel comfortable implementing it. At this point, obviously, the market has a lot more growth in this sector. We actually at Vituity have our own homegrown product that we're deploying at probably, right now I think, it's at 50 sites or so. It's called Sayvant, and it's also an AI scribe platform.

I've had experience with the Nuance one with Abridge with, obviously, our homegrown one and then I did demo a few others. There's the M*Modal one that they recently brought to the outpatient clinics at my hospital. That one is there as well.

**Client**
That's super helpful. I think we'll get to the homegrown solution and the other stuff that you've tried in a second. Can you walk me through the pre-AI scribe documentation workflow in the ED and what you were using? Were you guys using a dictation product? Were you outsourcing? Do you have in-house dictation teams for post-visit stuff?

**Expert**
Yeah, all the above. I'm old enough to remember when we used to use the phones to dictate our charts. We stuff T sheets back in the day and then we've transitioned to EMR documentation probably in the last 10 or 12 years with some form of voice dictation, whether it be Dragon or M*Modal. Those are heavily macro-driven, creates a very generic chart. You have to be very mindful of that.

I think you have to do your fair amount of due diligence and work on the back end to make sure that you're getting an adequate chart that not only is good for the encounter in terms of what you actually did and reflects that accurately, but also for billing purposes, for malpractice purposes. A lot goes into documentation, and I think it's one of the big pain points that we've experienced in the last 15 years as emergency physicians and just the physicians in general.

You talk about the outpatient docs too in terms of where you spend most of your time and you feel like

you're in a computer most time rather than actually talking to patients, which is unfortunate. That's the overall issue that we've had. We transitioned to hiring scribes that will actually come into the ER, they'll follow you around, they'll take your notes, they'll do your charts. They're expensive, there's a training process, there's a lot of turnover there. There's a lot of opportunity there to get that fixed as well.

I think that's where these AI scribe platforms really have a huge advantage and can bring not only a value when it comes to the finances of the physicians and the hospitals and departments, but also to patient care and allowing you to open up the ability to actually see patients and provide the care rather than sitting in front of computer typing away.

**Client**
Yeah. Are you guys still leveraging scribes that are coming into the emergency or are you fully transitioned over to one of these AI scribe products right now?

**Expert**
I actually work at a few different hospitals, and we're at various points in all of them. At my current hospital, we are still using physical scribes and to try to decrease the cost. We've gone to a scribe sharing platform. A lot of the newer physicians are very comfortable with their macros and don't necessarily want or need a scribe. They feel like it slows them down a bit to the point where they feel they could just be more productive.

Although, I think those are some of the folks that can probably use one of these technologies more readily because they'll be more comfortable with the technology piece of it. I think we are in the process of, right now, interviewing a few different companies. My hospital has Epic. Because of Abridge's partnership with Epic, I think they're the obvious company to be able to bring to the hospital. Obviously, there's a cost for the hospital with that.

With Sayvant, if we use that, it's our own homegrown one. There'll be no cost for the hospital. However, there was some concerns from our ask side. It seems like they were ready to pull the trigger on Abridge and then stopped for whatever reason. Because of that, they slow rolled the rest of all the other people that we were talking to. It's come to a little bit of a halt. If I could read between the lines, it sounds like we'll have something in the next six to 12 months. I just don't know what it is.

**Client**
This is super helpful. Maybe talk me through what you guys have built in-house and how that's getting rolled out. Is it emergency medicine-focused or is it broader? What's the core functionality and how do you guys think of it as different from Abridge or MDM's or DeepScribe or something like that products?

**Expert**
Great question. I think everyone's heading in this direction, but we probably got there first in terms of the back end of documentation. What Abridge and some of these more established companies did really well early on was get the documentation piece so that you get the history and physical exam. Are people on the call clinical or non-clinical? I just want to make sure I know who I'm talking to so I can get into appropriate amount of detail.

When you see a patient, there's a certain cadence that goes into seeing the patient and then doing the documentation. There's the initial part, which is the history. That's where they give you their piece. There's the physical exam, which is where we examine the patient, we put in our relative findings and then there's the end of it, which is the medical decision making. The first two pieces were done really well.

The back end was where, first of all, a lot of the work comes in. That's where all the billing comes in and that's where all the malpractice comes in. That part was not done well by the early companies. That's where Sayvant, which is our homegrown product, does a tremendous amount of the work. It provides clear pathways, it provides best decision making, differential diagnosis, and a lot of those back end things that a lot of these newer products or older products are not doing, although Abridge does have a partnership now to provide some of those clinical decision pathways.

They're starting to get into it too. I think a lot of folks will head into that direction because you're going to, first of all, start checking off stuff for billing, which is obviously important, but also for care in terms of CMS, quality measures, MIPS, which is the quality measures that we measure for different government agencies. Vituity, specifically, has this called QCDR which we partnered with CMS to provide this database and actually generates a fair amount of income for our partnership.

It's basically quality measures that we think really will help move the needle when it comes to cost-based value purchasing for the government. Everyone's heading there, but I think a lot of folks, still, that's in their infancy. I think that's something that Sayvant has done very early on. Now, the big issue for Sayvant is it doesn't have the Epic integration yet that Abridge does. I think that's where Abridge has a little bit of a lead and, obviously, a $5.3 billion valuation.

**Client**
That's helpful. When we're talking through some of these other workflows, I know Abridge has started to launch some of these. They have an order management workflow that they announced a couple weeks ago or some of these post-visit workflows as well. Are you guys going to reevaluate the Abridge product for that? Are there any other vendors that you've seen that are more competitive on decision diagnosis or billing support or all these other things that are more competitive to Sayvant than Abridge is?

**Expert**
No. I think Abridge, it's probably the next farthest along when it comes to it. They sent me a list of different companies, and I think I was familiar with like four out of the seven of them. Of all the ones that I've seen, the Abridge, the Nuance, the Dragon ones, the M*Modal ones, I haven't seen anything that has nearly the functionality that Sayvant does in that regard.

**Client**
Got it. One thing that we're curious about in the acute care setting is real-time feedback during patient encounters. This is also for quality to make sure that physicians are mentioning the right things, checking for the right things, some coaching or behavior change product immediately post-visit or during the visit. Is that something that you guys find important? Is that something that you've seen any of the scribes try to tackle or you're trying to do yourself at Sayvant?

**Expert**
All the above. It's happening already. Some of our more senior scribes, as they get comfortable, we'll remind the physicians. This is probably five, seven years in the making. They'll be like, "Hey, you forgot to put this in. Can I include it? What would you like me to put in for this?" For example, you put in an EKG reading and you forgot to put in the three factors to make sure you hit the billing thing or you are a head CT and you didn't put the indication in.

The current scribes do try to pull that from us when it's indicated. That being said, it's not consistent, it's not 100%. These newer, like Sayvant does, this where it will remind you to say, "Hey, you saw someone for syncope, which is loss of consciousness, you're the head CT. You need to provide the justification so that way we don't get dinged by CMS or whatever." It may be for this particular measure and then you'll put it in. That's all in there. The coaching part is definitely the next evolution.

Actually, I say current evolution because it's already happening within the different platforms and then also having live with scribes. A lot of the EMR platforms already do this to a certain degree. EMR platforms are very clunky, especially you talk something like Epic, which is probably the "best of the best." There's so many ways to do the exact same thing. It gets overwhelming truthfully and you miss things because of that.

**Client**
I think if there is an option for something else to take that part over, it would be well-received. That being said, physicians are a finicky breed. It takes time for us to adapt to things, especially when it comes to someone telling us what to do when we didn't actually think of it. I think that part always is interesting and will take some time for adoption.

Got it. When you say current scribes already do this, you mean human scribes who have been working?

**Expert**
Human scribes.

**Client**
Got it. Does Abridge do this already?

**Expert**
I don't believe so, but they're working on it probably. If I can interject one more thing that we haven't covered is the nursing portion of this. I don't know if you guys are interested in that part, but I think that it's a big part of this that hasn't necessarily been touted nor spoken about as much in the mainstream and within the informatics community. What, really, my hospital specifically is looking for is not only a solution to ease the physician documentation, but also the nursing documentation.

The goal of this is to be a one-stop ambient for everybody, not just for physicians. Patient comes in, we do what's called a team intake, meaning the physician and the nurse will talk to the patient together at the same time, get all the information. Right now, the patient comes in, they'll talk to the nurse and they'll talk to the doctor, then they'll talk to the next nurse and they're repeating the same information over and over again.

That creates inefficiencies within the system. Everyone gets maybe a different story potentially. There's a lot of problems with that particular model. What we try to do is do what's called a team intake, where everyone talks to the patient together, they get the information they need, and hopefully, these AI scribes will not only just document for the physicians but also for the nurses to help improve their efficiency.

**Client**
Got it. I can imagine for triage, the TN would also want some documentation product too.

**Expert**
For nursing specifically, absolutely.

**Client**
Okay. Are there any quirks or weird idiosyncrasies in the acute care setting that you find that there are huge gaps in what's available in the market and even in the solution that you guys have built out yourself?

**Expert**
Just in terms of AI documentation?

**Client**
Yeah, AI documentation.

**Expert**
Okay. If you're talking about just for AI documentation specifically, I think the lack of integration with the EMRs is probably the biggest issue right now because a lot of the transfer data has to be done manually. You're still either requiring yourself to do it or you're requiring another human to do it, which it does decrease the amount of human FTEs that you need.

That being said, still not a fully integrated system. I think until that piece is fixed, and Abridge and then, obviously, Sayvant, all these places are working on these with the different EMRs. There's so many different types of EMRs. Vituity is a huge physician group. We're in 23 states. We have 200 contracts all over the place. We deal with so many different EMRs and not all of them are Epic or MEDITECH. There's all these smaller EMRs that exist out there that folks are still on.

Page 5 of 9

To get those connections is a very arduous task. I think it's probably the biggest rate limit step to implementation because getting the AI document made is fine and that's great. You got to get into the EMR somehow and it's not as simple as a cut and paste. There's a lot of issues that go on there. I think that's probably the biggest gap right now in terms of actual day-to-day operations.

**Client**
Yeah. Maybe on that point for Vituity, 23 states, how many providers are we talking about? How many different EMRs do you have to work with? How does that think about Sayvant rolling out to this?

**Expert**
Yeah. We have 5,000 docs, 2,000 AP, and then about 2,000 ancillary staff that are billing, legal, that stuff. The number of different EMRs is probably north of 10-15-ish. Some of these are really esoteric smaller EMRs. Ibex is one that comes to mind that I know only one place uses. That's the only place I know that uses it.

There are a lot of smaller EMRs that are still out there that haven't been absorbed by the big boys or the hospitals have just stayed on them because it is not cost effective for them to go to one of these bigger EMRs just because of the cost and they don't have an organization behind them to scale.

**Client**
Got it. With that complexity and with that amount of staff, how are you thinking of rolling out Sayvant? Is it staged by geo, staged by EMR?

**Expert**
The best way to do it for us is by hospital system. As we've evolved in the last probably seven-ish years, rather than one or two contracts here and there, it's been more hospital systems that have really been our trusted partners that we've partnered with. When we have a system like that and they are looking for a solution, that's probably the best time to say, "Hey, we have this opportunity for the ERs to go to this, and there's very little cost for you as the hospital."

Obviously, if you could provide the hospital something at very little cost, you're obviously going to jump towards it. That being said, with the cybersecurity issues and different things, people are hesitant and they want to make sure that everything is checked out. We've obviously done our due diligence on our tech side to make sure that we have all the appropriate clearances and papers and this and that to show that it is safe for them to use just like it would be any other product.

I think for our purposes, if anyone wants to use it within Vituity, we're like, "Great, let's do it." We'll set them up with an account, we'll make sure we get the appropriate approvals from the hospital and we're ready to go. There's no lag on the Vituity end. It's more just folks saying, "Yeah. Hey, we're ready to go towards this." Some of the more community rural settings have really absorbed this because they don't have the budget to buy Abridge or buy some of these more expensive products. We could provide ours at a low cost for them because it's a value add for organization.

**Client**
Got it. If a hospital system is using something else for the ambulatory or inpatient setting, do you see them trying to push you guys to integrate with it? If they're already using Abridge or Ambience, do they try to tell you to use Abridge or Ambience or your physicians do in the ER?

**Expert**
Absolutely. Oftentimes, it's inferior product. I don't want to put Abridge in that because Abridge, I think, is a very good product. I remember when I was at Sequoia, they were trying to get us to use the 3M, whatever their ambient scribing was. It was awful. I demoed it and I was like, "We can't use this." We ended up just going with nothing. At that time, Sayvant was in its pretty early stages and wasn't necessarily ready to roll.

I don't think Sequoia at that time was ready to make that decision. Definitely, I think hospital systems want a one-stop solution. They don't want five different solutions for the same thing and whatever is more cost

effective but also solves their problem is the key. Oftentimes, getting in front of the key stakeholders that are going to make that decision and that's not always an easy task.

**Client**
Got it. If they still try to push something down on you, you can just decide to not use it and wait.

**Expert**
Absolutely. At the end of the day, it's up to the clinician to decide if they're going to use or not use a product. They're the ones taking care of the patient, you're the one signing the chart. I have not encountered a hospital system where you absolutely, 100%, have to do this and you have no other choice. Maybe that will happen one day, but it's up to the clinician to decide, "Hey, is this a value add for me, my patient care and my workflow, or is this going to be more cumbersome, this will slow me down and I'm not going to be able to get through my day as quickly?"

That being said, I think some of these "good products" are a value add. I think it's just a matter of getting people the appropriate training. Once they see the value in it and they see other folks saving two hours on documentation or other things, I think that's really when things take off. I think you're seeing that already with how quickly Abridge and even Sayvant is gaining traction.

**Client**
That makes sense. When we're thinking about physician delight and making sure your physicians are using the products they actually like, how do you test that and validate it? Do you run split tests where some physicians will try one product, the other physicians will try something else? What's the philosophy around trials and evaluation?

**Expert**
It's hard to find multiple products at the same site just because of the security clearances and different things that need to be implemented before you can even start using a product. Typically, there's probably a few different ways. The first way is the hospital gives you something, a bunch of physicians, "super users" will try and say, "Okay. This has value. They'll bring to the rest group and say, "Hey, you should try this. This is going to save you a ton of time."

A few people will try and say, "Hey, this sucks. We're not moving this forward." I think, typically, the hospital that brings in the system and then pushes it, or someone's like, "Hey, I use this at another place. This is great." They bring it to the hospital and the hospital's like, "Okay. We can move forward with it."

With the amount of clearances that are needed, especially for these kinds of solutions, you can't just try multiple products. I can't say, "Okay. I'm going to use Abridge today, use Sayvant tomorrow, and I'll decide which one's better for me." Unfortunately, it doesn't work that way at the hospital level. They have to pick a product, move forward with it, and then trial it.

**Client**
Have you guys heard of or tried a product called Clio Health? It's focused on the emergency medicine setting.

**Expert**
I feel like I've heard of Clio Health, actually. I think it was a health conference down in Vegas. HLTH is the name, the moniker for it. I want to say I actually interviewed them. I've never actually demoed it. I met them, I think, at their booth. I've definitely heard of it, but I've never used it, nor do I know about their functionality, but the name rings a bell.

**Client**
Got it. We are just curious because we saw that one was focused on this. Maybe the timeline? When you guys do one of these trials for, you are rolling out on a hospital system by hospital system basis, what are the usual timelines where you let people decide whether they want something or they don't want something?

**Expert**
Are you talking about the clinicians or the hospital system themselves?

**Client**
Procurement timelines in general.

**Expert**
Yeah. You're usually looking at three to six months. Most of it is IT clearances and sometimes, it can take up to a year truthfully. On our end though, if someone wants to use Sayvant, we could set them up next day because it's all web-based. You could be live within 24 hours if you get the appropriate thumbs up.

Getting the thumbs up from the hospital systems, typically, their IT departments and their legal is usually what takes the longest. That process typically is, I think, on the low end. Three months is probably ambitious, but I think six months to 12 months is how long it takes to work through these things.

**Client**
Got it. I assume for the product that you got for Sayvant, it's already pre-cleared by central IT so you can spin up new accounts really easily?

**Expert**
Absolutely. Our informatics team and our legal team have already done their due diligence. It's just a matter of getting the appropriate documentation to the hospital system so their teams can work through and make sure that they have what they need on their end.

Now, that we're live in, I think 50 is probably an underestimate, there's probably more hospital systems or hospitals and ambulatory settings that we're live in, we've streamlined our process in terms of getting them the information they need. Oftentimes, it's just a matter of bandwidth on the hospital side to actually get this done. They have so many other IT projects going on. To get through the clearances can be time consuming.

**Client**
That's super helpful. I'm curious if you find that the transcription quality vastly differs between products and why that might be. If any product has a good way for physicians to add their custom lexicons, their ways of pronouncing different phrases, is any product stellar at letting a physician tell the product how they speak?

**Expert**
All the products have a ramp-up period where you need to provide it with a certain amount of, "This is what I do on my end, whether it be the history, the physical macros, different things." Once that's in the system, then it's more intuitive for the good products. When I mean the good products, the ones that will rapidly take what you say. There's a little bit of a change in physician workflow. I'll give you my example specifically because I think that's more relevant than just speaking generally.

When I use an AI scribe product, my encounter with the patient is a little different than it is without it. I'll give you a quick example. I see someone for appendicitis. I go in the room without an AI scribe product. "What are you here for?" "I'm here for abdominal pain." How long has it been going on, get all the relevant data, do a quick exam, and then I go put in the orders for whatever I think I need to do for the diagnostics.

With the AI scribe, I have to take a second or two more and say, "Okay. You heard her. Abdominal pain. Where's your pain? Oh, it's on the right side. Okay. I'm examining the right side of your abdomen. You have tenderness there. There's no rebound regarding," I'm verbalizing things that otherwise, I would internalize, which then the AI scribe platform will use to make my document more accurate.

What's interesting about that is it feels really unnatural to do that. Patients absolutely love it. It's a huge satisfier for them. They like see you thinking through your process verbally out loud and then you're like, "I'm going to order some blood tests. I'm going to do a CAT scan. I'm going to give you this, I'm going to give you

that."

You have to be more specific with what you're going to do so that the AI scribe can pull that and then put it into your document rather than you knowing what you're going to do and go back to and then type it in saying, "Okay. I'm going to order morphine. I'm going to order Dilaudid. I'm going to order some fluids. I'm going to order CT scan." I think that part, it's part that takes some time to get used to. Once you get used to it, it's a great satisfier for patients too. That's an unintended consequence of all this that I've noticed.

Interesting. Is there anything else that drives huge physician delay right now? What are some of the ease of use features that the best scribe products have, but the worst ones don't?

I think the integration, as I mentioned before to the EMRs, and a seamless transfer of data is probably the biggest barrier at this point. I think most of the "good products" do the scribing part very well, so the history and the physical exam. I think it's that last piece that we talked about earlier, care pathways, quality measures.

If that part is the next frontier of AI scribing, you mentioned the word physician coaching, I think that's the next step to really help make these products better for the physician and then also for better patient care and quality. There'll be a lot of debate about whether that's the right way to go because it makes medicine an algorithm. There's still this art of medicine that exists because not everything falls neatly into a box. In my opinion as an active clinician, sometimes you have to go with your gut.

You feel something, you're like, "This is not right. This is telling me not to do it, but I got to do it because I think there's something actually here." These algorithms aren't always correct. They're good for the general population, but may not be right for that one individual encounter. I think that's where some of the stuff there'll be give and take with.

Cool. We've gone through all of our questions. This was very helpful. I appreciate it.
