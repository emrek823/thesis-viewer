SUBJECT: AWARD A CONTRACT TO INNOVACCER, INC. FOR A CLIENT DATABASE
CASE MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE SYSTEM; MASTER CONTRACT NO.
901961; PROCUREMENT CONTRACT NO. 22563; AMOUNT: $5,750,000

Dear Board Members:

## RECOMMENDATIONS:

A. Authorize the Purchasing Agent to execute a contract (Master Contract No. 901961; Procurement Contract No. 22563) with Innovaccer, Inc. (Principal: Baz Patel; Location: San Francisco) to provide a client database case management software system to the Alameda County Public Health Department, for the term of 1/3/22 – 1/2/25, in the amount of $5,750,000; and

B. Authorize the Auditor-Controller to make the related budget adjustments to increase appropriations by $5,750,000 offset by the same amount in revenues.

## DISCUSSION/SUMMARY:

The Alameda County Public Health Department (ACPHD) is currently structured into four service divisions: Family Health Services, Community Health Services, Public Health Nursing, and the Division of Communicable Disease Control & Prevention. In addition, the Office of the Director incorporates the Health Equity Policy & Planning Unit, which leads local policy and planning efforts, including efforts focused on healthy urban development and climate adaptation, as well as the Quality Improvement & Accreditation Unit.

For more than 80 years, ACPHD has worked to improve the health and safety of County residents and the neighborhoods in which they live. ACPHD has earned local and national recognition as a leader in the effort to achieve health equity. Each year, ACPHD serves tens of thousands of the 1.6 million residents of the County, focusing on populations disproportionately impacted by poor health, lack of opportunity, and structural racism. The staff and leadership reflect the full diversity of the County, the most diverse in the Bay Area and one of the most diverse in the nation.

The sheer size and complexity of the ACPHD (which has more than 500 staff and annually serves hundreds of thousands of residents) have led to a proliferation of more than 75 distinct programs, each often with its own data system, intake process, eligibility requirements, community partners, and funding mechanisms.

ACPHD seeks a new data system that shall:
* Enable tracking of clients and families across health and human services programs;
* Standardize intake and other forms for ACPHD programs for all clients;
* Improve access to client data for clients, staff, managers, and leadership;
* Improve ease of data entry;
* Reduce duplication of services to clients and families;
* Make data collection and reporting more flexible and customizable; and
* Improve cross-departmental and cross-systems coordination of services to promote equity.

This client database case management system would be foundational to ACPHD’s execution of the mission: to work in partnership with the community to ensure the optimal health and well-being of all people through a dynamic and responsive process respecting the diversity of the community and challenging us to provide for present and future generations.

## SELECTION CRITERIA/PROCESS:

ACPHD has determined that Alameda County does not currently have the resources to provide a client database case management software system. The Information Technology Department was consulted and was in agreement that a Request for Proposal (RFP) should be developed.

ACPHD worked with the General Services Agency–Procurement to develop a RFP, which was issued on February 1, 2021, posted on the website for 67 days, emailed to the Chambers of Commerce e-mail group, and sent to the E-Gov Professional Services – Current Contract Opportunities mailing service. The RFP was also advertised in The Inter-City Express on February 3, 2021 and The Piedmonter on February 5, 2021. A vendor outreach was conducted on February 10, 2021, followed by one networking/bidders conference on February 18, 2021, and was attended by 31 vendors.

On April 9, 2021, 12 bidders submitted responses to the RFP. Two responses were disqualified for not meeting the bidder minimum qualifications set out in the RFP. The remaining ten responses were evaluated by the County Selection Committee (CSC), and a shortlist of the top three bidders was developed. The top three bidders were interviewed by the CSC. A maximum total of 550 evaluation points was available for this RFP. The total evaluation points include 50 preference points derived from a 5% preference for local vendors and a 5% preference for certified Small Local Emerging Business (SLEB) vendors, for a total of 10%.

Innovaccer, Inc. was the highest-scoring qualified bidder and is being recommended for award. Innovaccer, Inc. is not a certified SLEB and is subcontracting 20% of the contract with Intrepid Ascent LLC (Principal: Mark Elson; Location: Berkeley; Certified Small: 17-00034; Expiration: 2/28/22) to provide expertise regarding the Alameda County Social Health Information Exchange integration, policy-technology alignment, data governance, and training.

The following is the evaluation summary of the top three shortlisted bidders.

### EVALUATION SUMMARY

| Vendor            | Location          | Local | SLEB | Evaluation Points |

| Thrasys, Inc.     | San Francisco, CA | N     | N    | 384               |

## FINANCING:

Funding for the contract comes from the Medi-Cal Administrative Activities and Targeted Case Management program funds. Appropriations for the contract in the amount of $5,750,000 will be adjusted with the offsetting program revenues in the ACPHD Fiscal Year 2021-22 budget per the attached financial recommendation. There is no increase in net County costs upon your approval of the recommendations.

## VISION 2026 GOAL:

The client database case management software system meets the 10X goal pathway of Accessible Infrastructure in support of our shared visions of a Thriving & Resilient Population.

Respectfully submitted,

Colleen Chawla
Director, Health Care Services Agency

## GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS

1. **INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR**: No relationship of employer and employee is created by this Agreement; it being understood and agreed that Contractor is an independent contractor. Contractor is not the agent or employee of the County in any capacity whatsoever, and County shall not be liable for any acts or omissions by Contractor nor for any obligations or liabilities incurred by Contractor.

Contractor shall have no claim under this Agreement or otherwise, for seniority, vacation time, vacation pay, sick leave, personal time off, overtime, health insurance medical care, hospital care, retirement benefits, social security, disability, Workers’ Compensation, or unemployment insurance benefits, civil service protection, or employee benefits of any kind.

Contractor shall be solely liable for and obligated to pay directly all applicable payroll taxes (including federal and state income taxes) or contributions for unemployment insurance or old age pensions or annuities which are imposed by any governmental entity in connection with the labor used or which are measured by wages, salaries or other remuneration paid to its officers, agents or employees and agrees to indemnify and hold County harmless from any and all liability which County may incur because of Contractor’s failure to pay such amounts.

In carrying out the work contemplated herein, Contractor shall comply with all applicable federal and state workers’ compensation and liability laws and regulations with respect to the officers, agents and/or employees conducting and participating in the work; and agrees that such officers, agents, and/or employees will be considered as independent contractors and shall not be treated or considered in any way as officers, agents and/or employees of County.

Contractor does, by this Agreement, agree to perform his/her said work and functions at all times in strict accordance with currently approved methods and practices in his/her field and that the sole interest of County is to insure that said service shall be performed and rendered in a competent, efficient, timely and satisfactory manner and in accordance with the standards required by the County agency concerned.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the County determines that pursuant to state and federal law Contractor is an employee for purposes of income tax withholding, County may upon two week’s notice to Contractor, withhold from payments to Contractor hereunder federal and state income taxes and pay said sums to the federal and state governments.

2. **INDEMNIFICATION**: To the fullest extent permitted by law, Contractor shall hold harmless, defend and indemnify the County of Alameda, its Board of Supervisors, employees and agents from and against any and all claims, losses, damages, liabilities and expenses, including but not limited to attorneys’ fees, arising out of or resulting from the performance of services under this Agreement, provided that any such claim, loss, damage, liability or expense is attributable to bodily injury, sickness, disease, death or to injury to or destruction of property, including the loss therefrom, or to any violation of federal, state or municipal law or regulation, which arises out of or is any way connected with the performance of this agreement (collectively “Liabilities”) except where such Liabilities are caused solely by the negligence or willful misconduct of any

# Master Contract No. 901961 Procurement Contract No. 22563 Page 4 of 13

indemnitee. The County may participate in the defense of any such claim without relieving Contractor of any obligation hereunder. The obligations of this indemnity shall be for the full amount of all damage to County, including defense costs, and shall not be limited by any insurance limits.

In the event that Contractor or any employee, agent, or subcontractor of Contractor providing services under this Agreement is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction or the Alameda County Employees’ Retirement Association (ACERA) or California Public Employees’ Retirement System (PERS) to be eligible for enrollment in ACERA and PERS as an employee of County, Contractor shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless County for the payment of any employee and/or employer contributions for ACERA and PERS benefits on behalf of Contractor or its employees, agents, or subcontractors, as well as for the payment of any penalties and interest on such contributions, which would otherwise be the responsibility of County.

3. **INSURANCE AND BOND**: Contractor shall at all times during the term of the Agreement with the County maintain in force, at minimum, those insurance policies and bonds as designated in the attached Exhibit C, and will comply with all those requirements as stated therein. The County and all parties as set forth on Exhibit C shall be considered an additional insured or loss payee if applicable. All of Contractor’s available insurance coverage and proceeds in excess of the specified minimum limits shall be available to satisfy any and all claims of the County, including defense costs and damages. Any insurance limitations are independent of and shall not limit the indemnification terms of this Agreement. Contractor’s insurance policies, including excess and umbrella insurance policies, shall include an endorsement and be primary and non contributory and will not seek contribution from any other insurance (or self-insurance) available to County. Contractor’s excess and umbrella insurance shall also apply on a primary and non contributory basis for the benefit of the County before County’s own insurance policy or self insurance shall be called upon to protect it as a named insured.

4. **PREVAILING WAGES**: Pursuant to Labor Code Sections 1770 et seq., Contractor shall pay to persons performing labor in and about Work provided for in Contract not less than the general prevailing rate of per diem wages for work of a similar character in the locality in which the Work is performed, and not less than the general prevailing rate of per diem wages for legal holiday and overtime work in said locality, which per diem wages shall not be less than the stipulated rates contained in a schedule thereof which has been ascertained and determined by the Director of the State Department of Industrial Relations to be the general prevailing rate of per diem wages for each craft or type of workman or mechanic needed to execute this contract.

5. **WORKERS’ COMPENSATION**: Contractor shall provide Workers' Compensation insurance, as applicable, at Contractor's own cost and expense and further, neither the Contractor nor its carrier shall be entitled to recover from County any costs, settlements, or expenses of Workers' Compensation claims arising out of this Agreement.

6. **CONFORMITY WITH LAW AND SAFETY**:

# Master Contract No. 901961 Procurement Contract No. 22563 Page 5 of 13

Contractor shall indemnify and hold County harmless from any and all liability, fines, penalties and consequences from any of Contractor’s failures to comply with such laws, ordinances, codes and regulations.

    b. Accidents: If a death, serious personal injury, or substantial property damage occurs in connection with Contractor’s performance of this Agreement, Contractor shall immediately notify the Alameda County Risk Manager's Office by telephone.

This report must include the following information: (1) name and address of the injured or deceased person(s); (2) name and address of Contractor's sub-Contractor, if any; (3) name and address of Contractor's liability insurance carrier; and (4) a detailed description of the accident and whether any of County's equipment, tools, material, or staff were involved.

    c. Contractor further agrees to take all reasonable steps to preserve all physical evidence and information which may be relevant to the circumstances surrounding a potential claim, while maintaining public safety, and to grant to the County the opportunity to review and inspect such evidence, including the scene of the accident.

    *   **8-9 Critical**: Business critical functionality is inoperable or the Product service has failed. This usually applies to a Production environment and indicates an inability to access services. Resolved in a critical impact on a Production condition requires an immediate solution.
    *   **6-7 High**: Critical loss of application functionality or performance resulting in high number of users unable to perform normal functions. Major feature/product failure (complete, widespread) exists. The program is usable but severely limited.
    *   **4-5 Medium**: Moderate loss of application functionality or performance resulting in limited users impacted in their normal functions. Minor feature/product failure, convenient workarounds/minor performance degradations.
    *   **1-2 Low**: The issue consists of “how-to” questions, configuration fixes related to one or multiple modules of integration, and inquiries, enhancement requests or documentation questions.

    (1) **Response times shall depend on the Priority Score**:

| SLA      | Response Time (Incidents only) | Resolve Time (Incidents only) |
| :------- | :----------------------------- | :---------------------------- |
| Critical | <2 hrs                         | <6 hrs                        |
| High     | <4 hrs                         | <9 hrs                        |
| Medium   | <1 business day                | <3 business days              |
| Low      | <2 business days               | <5 business days              |

        *   Scaling Box Model

*   **Project Management**
    *   Issue and risk identification
    *   Communication strategy
    *   Change management

    a. **Onboarding**: Contractor shall engage and onboard ACPHD with a clear focus on validating and understanding ACPHD requirements and business objectives, establishing a Program Management Office, understanding the existing landscape from a system configuration and integration standpoint, and identifying the optimum resources for ensuring program success. The completion of this phase will be the delivery of a Project Charter reviewed and agreed on by ACPHD, which will include forward-looking requirements and triaged development road mapping exercises.

    b. **Design**: In this phase, Contractor’s team shall work with ACPHD key stakeholders to document detailed requirements. Contractor shall conduct a gap analysis of current workflows with future workflows to determine maximum effectiveness. End to End test strategy formulation is done by the customer with optional assistance from Contractor’s team. Finally, end-user and organization-wide training plans shall be prepared with the ACPHD, which includes acceptance criteria and success metrics.

    c. **Development**: This phase kicks off the project for implementation of the Data Activation Platform for data migration and later data extraction, ingestion, and mapping from source systems. Contractor shall then perform normalization and standardization of integrated data and push the high-quality data to the platform which powers the InGraph for analytics. Contractor shall set up a detailed data governance structure for user management across the platform for limiting access to specific users, programs, and datasets.

    d. **Testing**: During this phase, Contractor shall engage test scripts and libraries to verify the functionality being delivered. Post-verification starts User Acceptance Testing (“UAT”) when ACPHD would execute the test strategy it had created during the design phase of the project. A sign off from end-users post-validation signifies satisfactory closure of this phase.

# Master Contract No. 901961 Procurement Contract No. 22563 Exhibit A-3 Page 2 of 4

    e. **Adoption**: Contractor’s team shall provide post-go-live support and maintenance for the user’s post-implementation. The key focus in the adoption phase would be on tracking technical and business issues, monitoring of interfaces, addressing project issues, and support services. As the ACPHD user community becomes acquainted with the system, many processes that were initially efficient may need to be reexamined and hence optimized.

    f. **End-User Feedback**: At every stage of implementation, cadence meetings are conducted to assess the project progress and milestones achieved. Each phase’s exit criteria are evaluated and once achieved, entry to the next stage is initiated. Contractor’s team and customer’s project manager shall discuss the progress and plan for the next stage of implementation.

#### THE IRAN CONTRACTING ACT (ICA) OF 2010

The California Legislature adopted the Iran Contracting Act (ICA) to respond to policies of Iran in a uniform fashion (PCC § 2201(q)). The ICA prohibits persons engaged in investment activities in Iran from bidding on, submitting proposals for, or entering into or renewing contracts with public entities for goods and services of one million dollars ($1,000,000) or more (PCC § 2203(a)). A person who “engages in investment activities in Iran” is defined in either of two ways:

1. The person provides goods or services of twenty million dollars ($20,000,000) or more in the energy sector of Iran, including a person that provides oil or liquefied natural gas tankers, or products used to construct or maintain pipelines used to transport oil or liquefied natural gas, for the energy sector of Iran; or
2. The person is a financial institution (as that term is defined in 50 U.S.C. § 1701) that extends twenty million dollars ($20,000,000) or more in credit to another person, for 45 days or more, if that person will use the credit to provide goods or services in the energy sector in Iran and is identified on a list created by the California Department of General Services (DGS) pursuant to PCC § 2201(b) as a person engaging in the investment activities described in paragraph 1 above.

By signing below, I hereby certify that as of the time of bidding or proposing for a new contract or renewal of an existing contract, neither I nor the company I own or work for are identified on the DGS list of ineligible persons and neither I nor the company I own or work for are engaged in investment activities in Iran in violation of the Iran Contracting Act of 2010.

If either I or the company I own or work for are ineligible to bid or submit a proposal or to renew a contract, but I believe I or it qualifies for an exception listed in PCC § 2202(c), I have described in detail the nature of the exception:

Apart from this, we have different care management platforms to support referrals, cases and clients respectively.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Apart from this, we have different care management platforms to support referrals, cases and clients respectively.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
