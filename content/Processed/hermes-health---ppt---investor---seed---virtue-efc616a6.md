Hermes Health
The Rails for Identified Health Data
1

# Slide 2

The Team & Founder

Confidential
CEO & Founder: Alejandro Zamorano
I've spent the last 15 years at the ground floor of building the rails
for health data movement at Datavant, PainQx, and Life Science
Nation.

I understand data movement and the ecosystem.
• Spearhead record retrieval solutions for life sciences at Datavant
(2024 to 2025).
• Led Datavant's Life Sciences vertical, scaled revenue from
inception (2019 to 2024).
• PainQx - 1st Employee (2015 to 2019)
• Life Science Nation - Founder (2012 to 2015)

# Slide 3

Identified Data – a $12B Untapped Market.
Identified Health Data is the Next Major Growth Frontier and it's currently Underserved.

Confidential
| Market Size | Medical Record Requests Per Year |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Attorneys (Mass Tort and Personal Injury) | 25,000,000 |
| Insurance (Life, Disability, Car, Workers) | 15,000,000 |
| Healthcare Analytics | 1,000,000 |
| Life Science Companies | 4,500,000 |
| Health Plans | 80,000,000 |
| TOTAL | 125,500,000 |
| MARKET | $12,500,000,000 |

# Slide 4

Identified Health Data is the Future
Identified Health Data is 10x More Valuable than De-identified Data.

Confidential
| Use Case | De-Identified | Identified |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Clinical Trials Recruitment | Protocol design and feasibility | Qualify patients directly for a particular study |
| Life Insurance | Analyze broad health trends and mortality for actuarial models | Underwrite a specific policy for individual |
| Health Care Operations | Process optimization and benchmarking | Patient specific billing audit and fraud detection |
| Life Sciences | Aggregated health and outcomes research | Find exact source of an adverse event with full clinical context |

Identified Data: $150 to $300 per patient
• Enables direct patient-level action
• Clear provenance
• Clearly measurable ROI
• Rich data profile

De-Identified Data: $0.01 to $10 per patient
• Limited to population analysis
• Unclear provenance
• Hard to measure outcomes
• Limited data profile

# Slide 5

Problem: Identified Data is Stuck in the Past
Access to Identified Data is Fragmented, Full of Friction, and Labor Intensive
The Problem
HIEs and TEFCA were designed to enable seamless health
data exchange but in practice, its made it worse. Access to
identified data is still full of friction:
• Fragmentation: 1,000+ data custodians with limited
footprint and coverage.
• Multiple Connections: Requestors need multiple data
sources to meet their needs.
• Friction: Labor cost of $100 to pull one medical record
• Confusion: Varying channels to get medical records
(fax, bespoke requestor portals, and limited APIs).

# Slide 7

Solution: Hermes- Fast, Centralized, Simple
One Network. One Platform. One API.
• Unified Front End: Workflows that
enables Requestors to compliantly submit
and receive requests for identified data.
• Unified Backend: A robust Network and
backend that delivers identified back to
Requestors.

Network Effect & Value
Hermes Provides Value to Both the Requestor and the Custodian – Creating a Reinforcing Flywheel effect.
| Requestor | Custodian |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Faster Turnaround: More Revenue | More Demand → More Revenue: Hermes expands your digital intake funnel, making it easy for requestors to submit and receive records driving higher volume and revenue. |
| More Data: More Revenue | One API → Lower Cost: Hermes handles all requestor integrations through a single API, removing one-off builds and manual fax work to cut engineering and labor costs. |
| Less Overhead: | Rules Based Routing → Enforce Compliance: Custodians set which request types they accept, and Hermes enforces those rules automatically for example, blocking malpractice requests. |
| One API to submit and retrieve identified health data no more bespoke connections, integrations, and maintenance. | Request Validation→ Fewer Cancellations: Hermes validates each HIPAA authorization before routing, reducing rejections and cancellations to improve margins. |

# Slide 9

Network Layer
The Network Layer Simplifies: Access, Compliance and Delivery of Identified Health Data
Access, Compliance and Delivery Layer
Confidential
• Intake: Requestors securely submit patient's full name, date of birth,
and a signed HIPAA Authorization form.
• Authorization Validation: Hermes verifies that each Authorization
meets the minimum criteria for processing. These validations will
reduce cancellation rates and risk exposure.
• Smart Routing: The Unity Platform then routes these requests to our
network of Custodians based off the Custodians fulfillment rules.
• Partner Fulfillment: Custodians processes these Requests and
transmit data back to Hermes
• Delivery: Hermes delivers the data back to Requestors without
revealing Custodian specific infrastructure-protecting privacy, and
confidentiality

# Slide 14

Business Model
We have a Simple Business Model that Scales as our Network Grows.
Business Model
• Hermes monetizes the Requestors.
| Category | Price | Gross Margin |
|------------------------|----------------------|--------------|
| Annual Platform | $10,000 to $100,000 | 90% |
| Record Request (End to End) | $50 Per Record | 20% |
| Record Request (Routing) | $5 Per Record | 80% |
| Site Sonar | $15 Per Patient | 66% |
| RX + Medical Claims | $50 Per Patient | 50% |

• Hermes pays the Custodian on a per record
or patient basis based on the dataset.
• Gross margin is the spread between what we
charge Requestors and what Custodians
charge us.
• As automation and network density grow,
gross margins expand.

Phase 1: Relevance
Build Atomic Network
Build the smallest minimum
viable network to validate
requestor and custodian
interest
Phase 2: Ubiquity
Achieve Requestor and
Custodian Ubiquity
Use the momentum to create
network to create a
self-reinforcing flywheel effect
and gravitational pull.
Phase 3: Scale
Expand to New Markets
Phase 4: Monetize
Unlock New Use
Cases
Use the network density to
expand into more markets.

# Slide 16

MOAT
Hermes Health's Moat = Network Density × Neutrality × Economies of Scale × Product Velocity
Connection Density
More Custodian connections mean fewer reasons for Requestors to
build their own. Each reinforces the Network.
Neutrality
We don't compete with Custodians or our Requestors. Our Neutrality
builds trust and drives adoption. Our Neutrality is our Superpower.
Economies of Scale
More volume allows us to negotiate lower Custodian fees, enabling
us to pass these savings to our Requestors.
Products Velocity
Our workflow innovations make data exchange seamless for
Custodians and Requestors. This speed lets us outperform Networks
of similar size with slower product cycles.

Why Now?
The De-Identified Data Market Created Comfort and Now to Grow is Expanding to Identified Use Cases
| Custodians | Requestors |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| • Built comfort exchanging de-identified data data across 1,000+ sources | • Largely unaware that health data can be traded or licensed |
| • De-identified market however is mature and becoming commoditized | • Still rely on fax and manual workflows |
|  | • Few know how to license or value health data |
| • Growth pressure is creating push for new markets and use cases | • Lack technical, operational, and legal knowledge to implement and integrate with Custodians |
|  | • Al agents are accelerating the need for compliant access to identified health data. |
| • Limited knowledge of use cases that require identified health data (this was intentional as cultural norm) |  |
| • Early APIs from Epic, Athena, Office Ally, Waystar are starting to create data liquidity |  |

Custodians Can't Be The Center
Why Custodians Can't Be The Center
• Competitive Conflict: Partners compete with each
other, making it difficult for any single partner to act as
a neutral hub for all.
• Limited Footprint: Individual partners have a limited
footprint on a patient data record. As a result they
cannot fulfill all requests.
• Trust: Partners don't trust each other and as a result
hesitate to share proprietary information directly with
each other, restricting cooperation.
• Complex Integration: Direct connections among
multiple partners create costly complexity, duplication,
and labor.
