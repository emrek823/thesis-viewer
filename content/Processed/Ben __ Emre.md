### Ben’s Background & Motivation

- Works at 3A Therapeutics (discovery-focused biotech company)
- Previously at Split Pass (seed to Series A stage), Albert Invent (formulation/materials science data platform)
- Dual background: software engineering + chemistry expertise
	- Can discuss CSTRs/batch processes with chemical engineers
	- Can handle SOC2 compliance conversations with IT teams
- Louisiana native, Arab background - brings direct communication style
- Motivated by early-stage infrastructure building from ground up
- Wants downstream exposure beyond discovery work
	- Discovery requires 20+ years biology experience to influence target selection
	- Manufacturing offers more immediate technical impact opportunities

### Why Now - Market Timing

- Biomanufacturing represents first-mover opportunity in underserved space
- AI-driven drug design hypothesis: more development candidates = higher manufacturing capacity needs
- Software 3.0 landscape enables bypassing traditional SaaS evolution
	- Current state: SharePoint drives, Excel files for CMO/CRO interactions
	- Opportunity to jump directly to AI-enhanced solutions
- Increased outsourcing + US onshoring investments creating specialized CDMO market
- Personalized medicine (gene therapy, biologics, bispecifics, RNA therapies) requires new infrastructure

### Platform Strategy & Competitive Positioning

- Building assistive AI agents vs. full end-to-end automation
	- Focus on human-validated processes rather than replacing scientists
	- More sellable approach than fully autonomous solutions
- Multiple value creation layers:
	- Low-hanging fruit: automate Excel/SharePoint workflows
	- Retroactive insights: identify batch optimization opportunities
	- Proactive recommendations: yield optimization, CDMO partner selection
- Integration challenges as competitive moat
	- LIMS, ELNs, quality systems don’t communicate well
	- API integration complexity creates defensibility
	- Cross-institutional data flow requires specialized solutions

### Product Development Considerations

- Current hyper-focus on first design partner (gene therapy)
- Key generalization questions:
	- Expanding “batch” concept beyond gene therapies to biologics/small molecules
	- Building rapid CDMO configuration capabilities
	- Scaling integrations across n-to-n systems architecture
- Potential competitive threats from incumbents (Viva, Benchling)
	- Legacy systems (80s/90s code bases) unlikely to build AI solutions
	- Need for integration layer regardless of individual system improvements

### Seed Round Requirements

- Timeline: Could raise beginning of next year with 1-2 more hires
- Two key milestones for larger rounds (12-18 months):
	- Land and expand: build platform beyond single product
	- Sign major CDMO (Lonza, Catalent, or specialized players like Genmab Bio)
- Network effects advantage: one CDMO works with ~30 sponsors
- Contract value: “meaty contracts” with big players enable significant round sizes
