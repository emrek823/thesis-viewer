### Company Background & Previous Experience

- Dreem: built sleep stimulation headband using brain activity/heart rate monitoring
	- Co-founded with neuroscientists, raised $55M over 3 years
	- Direct-to-consumer didn’t scale (10K units yearly at $500, no growth)
	- Pivoted to research labs + pharma companies (10x price increase, 500+ labs)
	- Sold company in two parts: research to Vicor Signals, clinic to Sunrise
	- Clinic became main business (Dream Health), just raised $30M
- Started Dune over a year ago after transition period

### Dune Evolution & Current Model

- Original thesis: AI can solve clinic scalability through three solutions
	- Back office automation
	- Quality of care consistency via automated care plans
	- Financial equation improvement with higher CPT codes
- Pivot to wearable care after device companies asked “what to do when we detect disease”
	- Withings partnership: 3 million active US users, 6% conversion to booked appointments
	- Focus on sleep apnea initially (15% population vs 5% for afib, 45% for hypertension)
- Patient journey: Withings app → appointment booking → AI data analysis → doctor consultation → automated treatment protocols
	- Treatment uses continuous sleep data for personalized interventions vs standard CPAP
	- 95% of sleep apnea patients abandon CPAP after one month
	- Alternative treatments: oral appliance, weight loss, GLP-1, positional therapy

### Fundraising & Growth Plan

- Target: $5M seed round (originally planned Q1 2026, now accelerated)
- Current commitments: $3M from existing investors, potential lead considering pre-empting
- 2025 goals: Complete treatment protocols, scale within Withings database
- 2026 targets: Add hypertension protocol, secure second wearable partner (Samsung/others)
- 2027: Scale through hiring doctors internally or partnering existing clinics
- Business model: Insurance-covered, no patient acquisition costs due to wearable partnerships

### Next Steps

- Virtue to huddle and respond by end of week/early next week
- Quentin offered additional 30-minute follow-up if needed for decision-making
