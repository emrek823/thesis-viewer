### Customer & Market Feedback

- Customer buying behavior shift (18-24 months ago vs now)
	- Previously: pilot phase, considering multiple options
	- Currently: choosing companies based on product roadmap and shipping velocity
	- Buyers want 1-2 AI solutions, not 20 point solutions
- Product velocity now critical underwriting factor
	- How quickly teams ship features
	- Strategic roadmap thoughtfulness
	- Multi-product expansion capabilities
- Pharma tech considerations
	- Data providers (Doximity, Open Evidence) now Series A/B discussion
	- Previously end-game question

### Investment Strategy & Data Model Focus

- Pacing slower than historically due to point solution saturation
	- Not excited about 20 different specialty products
	- Few scaled software platforms in healthcare for exit opportunities
- Data model as expansion framework
	- Translucent example: 90%+ margins with structured data only
	- Redefined data model around provider/patient financial context
	- Can query margins for value-based care vs fee-for-service
- Standard Model Bio approach: building complete solution from outset
- Payment integrity emerging as “prior auth of 2024”
	- Deep J-curve requiring incubation model
	- 12 months to get first payer, then scales rapidly

### Incubation & Partnership Opportunities

- Virtue VC considering Fund 2 incubation
	- Care delivery models 2.0: high 30s to 65-70% gross margins
	- Blueprint for $100M revenue over 5 years
	- Learning process in real-time
- Potential collaboration areas
	- Holding company structure with tuck-in acquisitions
	- Services roll-up (virtual businesses)
	- Pre-seed to drawable facilities structure
- Sage Kanuja example
	- Sold business to Galileo for $5-10M
	- Building next-gen Veracyte starting with brand websites
	- ARX Assistant partnership with Gutterx strategic announcement
- Post-marketing surveillance opportunity
	- For-profit Sentinel version for drug safety
	- First-party data network requiring incubation time

### Next Steps

- Tyler to send structuring ideas email to Emre
- Q4 goal to develop partnership game plan
- Potential NYC meeting in 2 weeks for whiteboarding session
