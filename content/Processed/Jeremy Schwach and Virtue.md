### Jeremy’s Healthcare AI Reality Check

- Most voice AI / healthcare automation still marginal improvements
	- Comprehensive scheduling reduced from 14 weeks to 12 weeks using AI
	- Still facing same core problems: Epic monopoly, integration challenges, security issues
- LinkedIn AI success stories mostly hype
	- Behind closed doors, founders admit limited enterprise impact
	- FOMO driving C-suite interest but no real P&L results yet

### Market Dynamics & Epic’s Dominance

- Epic running 200+ AI pilots (Emmy for external, internal efficiency bot)
	- Same pilots as independent companies but within walled garden
	- Full template access gives Epic massive advantage
	- Will replicate 30-year playbook but faster with AI
- Independent companies forced to double-build around Epic limitations
	- Engineering differentiation still matters more than expected
	- Healthcare-specific domain expertise + good engineering = winning combination
- Mid-market (Athena) more open but vendors will eventually consolidate there too

### Security & Implementation Challenges

- Security essentially non-existent across AI startups
	- Third-party connectors, unclear data handling
	- Hummingbird chose slower ChatGPT over faster insecure solutions
	- Business death risk if data leaks in high-trust health system contracts
- Patient experience gap
	- Patients want OpenTable-style online booking, not robot conversations
	- Real solutions existed pre-AI; roadblocks remain operational/political, not technical
- Hallucination problem unsolvable with current LLMs
	- Best published results: 52% accuracy on DRG coding from discharge notes
	- Requires continuous fine-tuning and guardrails rather than fundamental solution

### Opportunities & Investment Thesis

- Credentialing vertical opportunity
	- Network effect play: become concierge for doctors, aggregate all credentialing data
	- Then sell B2B SaaS services to health systems
	- Current players like Certify hit growth walls, need broader scope
- Vertical-focused approach essential
	- Own all levers since robots won’t fix underlying system problems
	- Success requires 400+ experiments for incremental 5% margin improvements
- Human-in-the-loop use cases work well
	- One-on-one interactions (reviews, coding, research) highly effective
	- Biopharma multimodal insights generation showing promise
	- No enterprise P&L impact yet, just personal productivity gains
