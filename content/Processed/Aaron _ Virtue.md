### Tuva’s AI Strategy Pivot

- Don Rouser from Tuesday built AI tool (“Impactable”) running on Tuva data model
	- AutoML + ChatGPT for healthcare model training
	- User prompts like “train model to predict heart failure decompensation”
	- Automatically suggests best features from code sets (ICD-10, SNOMED, LOINC)
	- Outputs model spec → model builder pings Tuva data model → creates training dataset → spits out model with performance stats (AUC)
	- Already live and functional
- Positioning as potential acqui-hire
	- Don joins as Head of AI with equity compensation
	- Paul Jansen (their mutual friend) has been discussing with Don for months
	- Risk: Tuesday is current Tuva customer, could lose them or become bigger customer
- Defensibility through Tuva’s data model
	- Federated training across customer data
	- Model library where every trained model joins collection
	- AI recommends best models based on available features
	- “What makes it defensible is Tuva” - not just chat GPT plus AutoML

### Business Impact Assessment

- Market timing driven by customer demand
	- Multicare interested in AI, Canal Partners would “probably write a check” if deal closes
	- Health systems have 5+ AI pilots but unclear ROI, internal pressure to buy AI
- Transforms product roadmap from table stakes to exciting
	- Current products (EMPI, NCQA, benchmarking) necessary but not differentiated
	- AI decreases model training time from 1 month to 10 minutes
	- Data analysis from 6 weeks to 10 minutes
	- Data mapping from weeks to 10 minutes
- Revenue potential shift
	- Current path: solid $100M ARR business
	- AI path: potential for much larger outcome
	- “Are we going to build billion dollar revenue company on EMPI, NCQA? No”

### Fundraising Strategy for Health 2024

- Timeline: Demo and slides needed immediately for Vegas conference
- Don committed to collaboration over next few days, demo expected tomorrow
- Messaging for investors
	- Previous conversations: Here’s what’s different since we last spoke
	- New conversations: Lead with AI story as core pitch
	- Framing: “Earned the right” with solid business, now see larger 2.0 opportunity
- Current fundraising metrics
	- Target: $3-5M Series A
	- 4 investments made from Fund II, on pace but seeking 1-2 more before year-end
	- 5 meetings scheduled for Health 2024, needs 10+ more
- Action items
	- Will update on additional people to contact before Vegas
	- OpenAI dinner invitation Monday night - confirmed attending
