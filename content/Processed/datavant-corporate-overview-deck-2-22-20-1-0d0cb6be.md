# Our Contentions

1. Data fragmentation is the biggest bottleneck to realizing the power of data and technology in healthcare.

2. Solving it requires a health data network.

3. To build the health data network, you must be ubiquitous, privacy-centric, and neutral.

# Life of a Datavant Customer: SHYFT
### a Medidata company

| Problem | Walg | accredo | reens | MCKESSON |
|---------|------|---------|-------|----------|
| SHYFT offers medication adherence analysis for customers with specialty products | Specialty Pharmacy | Specialty Pharmacy | Specialty Pharmacy |  |

- Understanding adherence requires connecting specialty pharmacy data
- Datavant’s Solution:
- De-identify: Sources can only send data to SHYFT in de-identified form
- Link: SHYFT wants to understand which patients switch pharmacies (v. drop out), so Datavant tokenizes the de-identified source records so they are linkable

### Improved medication adherence tracking

# Competition

- Historically, companies offering similar capabilities focus on building vertically-integrated data and analytics companies
- **IQVIA**: ~$28B market cap
- Connectivity has always been a means to an end – never the end itself
- As a result, no one has won the connectivity market end-to-end (or built the products and architecture necessary to do so)
