### HealthMC Product Performance Update

- Current burn: ~$175K/month (maximum forecasted)
- Team reduced through RIFs, focused on AI research and data ops
- Platform improvements delivered significant results:
	- 98% recall, 90s precision on AI performance
	- ROI models showing 8-10x returns on customer data
	- Inference costs dropped 98-99% (V0: $3/chart → V2: 2 cents/chart)
	- Fixed data ops issues causing 10% chart loss (high-value charts)

### Active Customer Contracts

- Render contract signed: $50K installation + 10% of value found
	- Processing 16K patients through year-end
	- Handshake agreement to move off Credo paper if successful
	- Conservative model: $500K value = $100K total payment
- Kieran ongoing discussions with Nate Amak (Chief Population Health Officer)
	- Strong ROI presentation, evaluating integration needs
	- Competing against internal AI builds
- Gather and PCC contracts continuing into next year

### Payer Market Research Strategy

- Conducting product research calls (not direct sales pitches)
- 40 outreach attempts → 20 calls (10 completed, 10 scheduled)
- Key insights emerging:
	- Cost reduction focus vs. revenue generation
	- Interest in DRG detection (overbilling prevention)
	- 5% chart review requirement resonates with payers
- Blue Cross Blue Shield NC showed interest in broader applications

### Financial Projections & Runway

- Current revenue finishing ~$750K (mix of recurring and one-off)
- Conservative projection: $1.5M ARR by mid-2026 from Render + Kieran
- Runway extends through October 2026 at $0 operating margin
- Pricing model: $50K platform fee + $0.75/encounter
- Cost structure: 2.5 cents inference + 1-2 cents human QA = 80%+ margins

### Go-to-Market Questions

- Platform proven, clear customer value demonstrated
- Remaining challenge: building robust commercial pipeline
- Sales cycles: 18-24 months for payer contracts
- Two hiring priorities when revenue supports:

### Next Steps

- Judah: Continue product research calls with payers and payviders
- Sean: Will intro to Kieran CFO if timing makes sense (no immediate outreach needed)
- Virtue team: Provide payer contacts for product research discussions
- All: Reconvene in person (JP Morgan conference timing) to assess fundraising readiness
