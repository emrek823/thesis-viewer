## Slide 3: The traditional way SMBs have handled health insurance is dying, and they need an alternative.

Employees and dependents
are likely to lose coverage as fully insured
small group plans are phased out by carriers
in the next 5 - 10 years.

## Slide 4: ICHRAS are here to save the day

In 2019 the IRS passed legislation to allow uncapped, pretax employer funding to cover medically approved employee expenses (including premiums). Meaning that for the first time ever....

1.  **Employers could set budgets**
    With no minimum contribution, employers could set their own allocations.

2.  **Employees could pick their plans**
    The entire individual market became an option, not just three arbitrary plans.

3.  **Health benefits could be easy**
    Employers could act as a funding source instead of a plan admin.

## Slide 7: We're replacing disinterested brokers.

We couldn't give money away to get brokers interested in SMB ICHRAs.
So we're keeping it and building a simpler experience without them.

**3%** Of first 30 companies came from a broker
**Learning:** traditional brokers don't like
touching SMB's health plans or ICHRAs.

Meaning we don't have to juggle this mess that our competitors do...
