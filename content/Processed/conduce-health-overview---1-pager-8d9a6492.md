CONDUCE
HEALTH

**Challenge:** Value-based/risk-based models in healthcare are increasing in prominence across the care continuum with an expectation that 22% of all insured lives by 2025 (currently 15%) will be receiving care in a risk-based model. The primary care market has many players attempting to take on risk directly:

*   "Payviders" – Optum, Hallmark, Aetna
*   Vertically integrated risk-bearing entities: Oak Street Health, ChenMed, CareMax
*   Provider value-based care enablement platforms: Aledade, Pearl, Agilon

Given the chronic disease burden in the US and the average Medicare FFS patient sees more specialists than PCPs annually (5 specialists and 2 PCPs), incorporation of specialists into value-based care is inevitable and needed to realize the thesis of value-based care.

There are few, proven models that enable and incentivize well-paid (and potentially wasteful) specialists to formally join a value or risk-based arrangement. Three struggles are fundamental to this specialty care challenge: appropriate attribution of patient care to multiple providers, payment structures that would materially, financially impact practices, and tools that enable value over volume.

**Solution:** Conduce Health is the bridge to value-based speciality care. Conduce takes on specialty care risk from our risk-bearing PCP partners and in turn guarantees savings, streamlines contracting and payment processes with specialists, and uses ML to optimize the matching of complex patients and specialists.

The Conduce platform delivers the following for the risk-bearing entities:

1.  Identification and pricing for complex patients requiring specialty care
2.  Each patient matched to best specialist for their individual needs
3.  Guaranteed financial savings
4.  Collaborative care enablement via real-time data on outcomes and quality indicators

For the specialists:

1.  Streamlined sub-delegated contract process
2.  Additional revenue from shared savings
3.  Predictable revenue
4.  Faster payment as compared to traditional claims process

**Team:** Conduce Health is backed by AlleyCorp and is led by a team of seasoned healthcare operators, Eric Rosow (CEO), Najib Jai (COO), Sid Salvi (Head of Product) and Jeff De Flavio (Exec Chair of Board).
