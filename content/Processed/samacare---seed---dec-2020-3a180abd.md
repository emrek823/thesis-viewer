Pharmas face a huge "last-mile" problem that did not exist for traditional medications

How to create a "blockbuster" drug

*   Conduct R&D to get new drugs to market
*   Build sales and marketing org to get physician buy-in
*   Clear insurance and other hurdles to get patients initiated and staying on therapy
    *   225% growth since 2013 in pharma spend on "last-mile" services

## Slide 8: We start with a focus on the #1 pain point for specialty drugs: prior authorization

We start with a focus on the #1 pain point for specialty drugs: prior authorization

(Image of various medical forms for prior authorization: Aetna, Humana, Envolve)

*   37% of PAs get delayed by 10 days or more
*   ~15% of PAs get a denial
*   96% of docs agree PA burdens would affect willingness to prescribe, if a similar alternative exists

## Slide 9: Value we give away for free vs. Value to pharmas

**Value we give away for free to build the network**
Help medical practices digitize and automate prior authorization workflows

**Value to pharmas who buy from us**
Enable pharmas to prevent/fix prior authorizations failures (and thus improve sales):
*   Visibility (data) into failures
*   Leverage to automatically address those failures

## Slide 10: Our first two deals demonstrate high ACV — and are only scratching the surface

Our first two deals demonstrate high ACV — and are only scratching the surface

**Beovu**
Direct contract with Novartis, closed Sep 2020

**CareMetx**
Partnership contract starting with Eylea (Regeneron) and Udenyca (Coherus), plus several other target drugs, closed Sep 2020

| Metric             | Beovu    | CareMetx |
| :----------------- | :------- | :------- |
| ARR by end of 2021 | $540K    | $1.5M    |
| ARR by end of 2022 | $1.1M    | $3.0M    |
| Potential deal ARR | $3.6M    | $21M     |

    *   Jan (0%) to Oct (33%)
    *   ~20%: sufficient volume for pharma contracting (around March of the second year)
    *   ~25%: saturation among the highest-volume practices (around May of the second year)
    *   October: 33%
*   **Oncology (blue area)**
    *   Starts around July of the second year and reaches 6% by October.

## Slide 18: How our contracts work

How our contracts work

(Bar chart illustrating contract components)

*   **Implementation and professional services fees, paid upfront** (Tallest bar on the left, dark blue)
    *   Meaningful upfront fee improves our cashflow
*   **Monthly platform fee** (Shorter bars, dark blue base)
    *   Creates minimum predictable revenue
*   **Monthly transaction fee, paid by prior authorization conducted through our system** (Light blue top portion of bars, increasing over time)
    *   Allows us to capture massive upside as our customers gain more value
