### Technical Architecture & Competitive Position

- Built on Graph RAG engine (proprietary approach using UpToDate’s graph-formatted data)
- Strong on transcription, RAG indexing, clinical decision support integration
- UpToDate access obtained through Warren’s Columbia executive master’s program connection
- Gaps to address:
	- Prior auth flagging (claims “easy to build in <1 week”)
	- Coding accuracy stress testing (1-5 levels for primary care)
	- Automated claims submission/denial processing
	- Voice agents for insurance company calls
- Competitive advantage: first mover in real-time clinical+payer guidance space

### Current Traction & Growth Plans

- Core team: Josh (product), Ethan (RAG engineer), Warren (ex-Advent boss), plus new full-stack engineer
- Recent progress: 3 new clinics onboarded this week
- End of January goals:
	- 15-30 private practices signed
	- Complete Advent Health pilot conversation (50 physicians initially)
	- Launch direct-to-physician bottoms-up approach (following Open Evidence model)
- Enterprise strategy: leverage individual physician adoption to approach Cleveland Clinic Florida, Baylor (family connection)
- Future fundraising planned when entering first major institution
- Long-term goal: build proprietary clinical database to reduce UpToDate dependency
