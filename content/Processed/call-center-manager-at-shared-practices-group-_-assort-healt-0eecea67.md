# Assort Health - Call Center Manager at Shared Practices Group
Interview conducted on August 01, 2025

## Topics
ROI, Tech Stack, Specialty Dentistry, Cosmetic Dentistry, PMS Solutions, Practice Locations, Dentists, Dentures

## Summary
The Tegus Client discussed with an expert the implementation of Assort Health in the dental industry, particularly in denture and implant specialty practices. The expert, who supports 40 active dentistry practices, emphasized the importance of addressing missed opportunities when calls go unanswered. They also mentioned the challenges faced in the dental market, the use of Open Dental for PMS software, and the limitations in exploring other software solutions due to existing contracts. The expert highlighted the value of Assort Health in generating leads and tracking patient acceptance of treatment, although specific ROI numbers were not provided.

## Expert Details
Call Center Manager at Shared Practices Group, a customer of Assort Health. The expert's role has grown to much more than the head of the contact center, as they are involved with implementing Assort Health within their sphere.

Call Center Manager at Shared Practices Group, a dental practice. The expert is responsible for all of the phones and the calls in the organization, whether it be in the contact center or offices. I also do all call training. The expert's role has grown to much more than the head of the contact center, as they are involved with implementing Assort Health within their sphere. The expert spearheaded a project to change from one phone provider to Ring Central for all of their offices. The expert is responsible and in charge of all things call-related. The expert is a current customer of Assort Health and Ring Central.

## Client
Hello and thanks for your time today. I would love to learn about Assort Health. It sounds like you are a customer of theirs. Just wanted to chat with you about how you think about ROI there, what impact it's done to your business, but also how it fits into your broader tech stack like other PMS solutions that you guys might be using, whether it is Weave or something else.

Think about it a little bit more strategically on future spend, willingness to spend, what happens if one of these PMS solutions build one themselves, etc. I don't know too much about the dental space. I know market structure, etc., so all of that would be helpful context as we chat through this.

## Expert
My pleasure. We currently are a customer, and I support upwards close to 50 practices. What we were solving for is if our practices weren't able to answer and our contact center wasn't able to answer, what's happening with these opportunities. That's how we came to know Assort Health ourselves as we're looking for that solution.

## Client
Maybe just a little bit of background then. It sounds like at Shared Practices Group, there's about 50 locations or maybe just would love the summary of number of locations, how many physicians.

## Expert
Yeah, it is currently 40 active practices and just the same, it would be 40 active dentists. We have a dentist in each practice.

## Client
Is this just general dentistry, or is this specialty?

## Expert
It is specialty, denture and implant.

## Client
Denture and implant specialty. That's everything. That's the only thing you guys do across all four locations?

## Expert
That's right.

## Client
Tell me a little bit about the dental market if you can. It seems like there's this overarch, there's this bucket of general dentistry, and then there's all these different lines of specialty dentistry, whether it's orthodontics, denture, and implant.

## Expert
Yeah. I think what you'll find is general dentistry is driven off of really insurance is such a big source for general dentistry in which specialty like what we do, it's a big-ticket item, in which insurance doesn't typically cover a lot. It's something that wasn't around many years ago in such a cost-effective way, but that's what we zero in on. There's a lot of different specialties, but that's really where it comes down to is it's either cosmetic or general.

## Client
Yeah. Basically, it seemed like more cosmetic related, more private pay, bigger ticket items. There's probably higher margins in those practices, so probably higher willingness to spend on these newer age tools like an Assort. Maybe quickly, I'd love, if you know, just a quick overview of your guys' tech stack. Who do you use for the PMS? How much do you spend on Assort? Also, how much do you spend on that PMS?

## Expert
On the spend piece, I'll be honest, I'm not exactly sure. I'm on the nuts-and-bolts side of things.

## Client
Maybe just on the call center side, what were you guys doing previously across all 40 practices? Was it an in-house call center centralized somewhere? Was it just a front desk associate for each?

## Expert
Yeah. It's been a little bit of all of that, offshore, onshore, in the practice, voicemail. There's been many different methods tried.

## Client
It sounds like you guys had a pain point, like calls weren't being answered. What was the biggest reason for that?

## Expert
Yeah. In this space, one of the things that's a little different is surge queuing. It's unpredictable. If your people are available, next moment they're all engaged. There's no rhyme or reason other than just the marketing engine in itself. Having that can happen at any time. You don't want to miss any opportunities.

## Client
In specialty dentistry, I've heard about a couple other software. Actually, maybe first, who do you guys use for your PMS software?

## Expert
Open Dental is the software that's currently used.

## Client
Okay, have you heard of tools like Phreesia or Weave or CareStack at all?

## Expert
I have heard of Weave. I want to say I have only heard a little bit of the Phreesia. None of the other. I've heard of Weave. I even have been asked about Weave internally and some of those features.

## Client
What I'm trying to figure out is dentistry obviously is a very vertical solution. It's a very specific market. Usually, when that happens, there's a lot of very bespoke software tools for that vertical. Weave and also Phreesia and Open Dental, clearly only for the majority of the dental market.

For voice solutions like a software solution for call centers, etc., or scheduling, email, text, etc., just confirming appointments, it seems like Weave and Phreesia also have loosely those tools. It might not only be right for calls but certainly that they do help a lot with that. I'm just wondering a little bit of your guys' history on why you guys haven't signed up one of those. Basically, just trying to figure out a little bit more the state of the full dental.

## Expert
Currently, I know that for phone services, we're under contract. Under contract with that provider, it makes it a little difficult to, I would say, go to another provider just for the other features and not use it, don't want to break your contract.

## Client
When you say under contract, that's with Assort?

## Expert
For VoIP services, no. We're a little different. We partner with Assort, and they have latched onto our system.

## Client
What do you mean by the phone service versus the voice?

## Expert
Assort doesn't provide our phone services.

## Client
You're talking about regular telephony?

## Expert
You got it.

## Client
I guess like other solutions, my understanding was it provides a little bit more of what Assort does. I don't know who you use for your phone service but it's not like a Five9 or a Genesys or anything like that?

## Expert
No, it's actually a very similar system to one of those. You're on the right track. I think there's a lot to that because I want to say the system that we had changed from, there was just a lot of challenges with it. I don't know, my opinion is just you handcuff yourself from being able to try some other things by getting into an all-in-one service. That's just my opinion.

## Client
Maybe then just quickly, would love to hear about some of the ROI and how you guys track how Assort has done for you guys. I don't know if it's like number of calls that previously were dropped or abandoned that has improved or maybe even revenue.

## Expert
Yeah, that's one way. I think the real value is that it's not a huge, large amount that gets sent, but the value of the lead that we get. That's what we really measure, whether they showed and/or they accepted treatment.

## Client
Do you have any hard numbers behind that at all, just to contextualize that?

## Expert
No, not currently, I don't.

## Client
Well, thank you so much for all your insights. This has been really helpful. I hope you enjoy the rest of your day.
