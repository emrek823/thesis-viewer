### Winnie’s Background & Motivation

- IB/PE background, then biz ops at Bird (handled growth initiatives, forecasting, vehicle allocations)
- Chief of Staff at Greenlight Technologies (construction permitting software)
	- Built go-to-market and ops teams from handful to 25+ people
	- Led Series A raise with Crap Ventures
- Personal passion for mental health drove transition
	- Therapy patient herself, sees benefits across friends/family
	- Interviewed 25+ therapists to identify pain points
- Recognized pattern: behavioral health workers massively underserved despite serving others

### Attune Platform & Product Strategy

- Initial wedge: Note scanner for supervisors
	- Solves 3 pain points: liability risk, time savings (6-9 months to teach good notes), revenue (10-20% claim denial rate)
	- AI flags potential issues, supervisor confirms/overrides, adds feedback
	- 2 LOIs signed, launching after HIPAA-compliant platform ready
- Long-term vision: “Gong meets Lattice” dashboard
	- Quality control and career development for all user types (COOs, supervisors, pre-licensed clinicians)
	- Clinical coaching using session transcription data
	- Continuing education: “Masterclass meets Spotify meets Delphi” - bite-sized, caseload-relevant content
	- ICP development to help therapists specialize vs. claiming they “tackle everything”
- Market feedback: Supervisors willing to pay $80-100k annually for note review module alone
- Quality shift: Mental health becoming more outcomes/metrics-based (PHQ9, GAD7) for insurance rate negotiations

### Fundraising & Next Steps

- $1.5M raise starting after Labor Day
	- 12-18 months runway with team of 3: Winnie, clinical psychologist co-founder, founding engineer
- Milestones:
	- Q4: Product in users’ hands
	- Q1: Convert freemium partners to paying customers, shorten timeline
	- Larger seed round based on traction data
- Market context: Access largely solved, now quality/retention focus (20-25% therapist attrition = $500M industry revenue loss)
