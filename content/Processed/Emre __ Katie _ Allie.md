### Alejandro / Hermes Investment Opportunity

- Great reference after great reference from multiple sources
- Buttoned up materials despite not actively fundraising
	- First interaction showed obsession with business details, slide for every aspect
	- Recent team call showed significant progression in thinking
	- Excellent job articulating complex topics to broader team
	- Phenomenal walkthrough of network/marketplace vision
- Alejandro at the helm is primary attraction
	- True subject matter expert in identified data space
	- Learned from Travis May approach to network building
	- Not sophisticated in fundraising process but brings Datavant experience
	- Produces detailed 3-page memos within 24 hours of requests

### Fundraising Timeline & Structure

- Target raise: $4-5M with standard dilution expectations
- Open to preemption before formal January process
	- Would still want conversations with small group (4-5 firms, not 20)
	- Prioritizes certainty over saving 1-2% dilution
	- JPM pegged as anchor for formal process kickoff
- Current status:
	- Limited inbound conversations so far
	- Virtue/Sean haven’t opened full network yet due to other portfolio priorities
	- Alejandro compiling target list seeking feedback from investors
- Torch interest:
	- $2M check size target
	- Goal to close before end of year if conviction reached
	- Co-lead structure possible
	- Team impressed after recent IC pitch - working through margin/TAM questions

### Business Focus & Partner Needs

- Primary goal: maximize custodian network buildout
	- Can deploy $5M immediately with specific custodian targets mapped
	- Considering accelerating 2-year goals into 1 year with sufficient capital
- Ideal partner qualities:
	- Strong relationship building capability
	- Understanding of network/marketplace business models
	- Hiring support for technical team expansion
	- EHR direct integration complexity
	- Data normalization requirements
- Market dynamics favor speed - limited winner-take-all opportunity
