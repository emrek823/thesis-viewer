A. Project Principal: Dr. Michael McGuire

B. Conduct of the Project: iMc and the Project Principal shall perform the Project in compliance with (a) the Protocol (as amended from time to time), (b) all applicable local, state and federal laws and iMc's own ethical standards and policies. Any party who becomes aware of the need for a deviation from the Protocol will immediately inform the other party to this Agreement of the facts necessitating the deviation as soon as such facts become known.

C. HIPAA: The Partner shall establish a process of de-identifying data in conformance with HIPAA and privacy compliance in handling healthcare data. All data provided to the Partner shall be stored in a private and secure fashion. The Partner shall operate the service in a manner that provides reasonable information security for data, using commercially reasonable data backup, security, and recovery protections.

## APPENDIX A
## PROJECT PROTOCOL

**Objective**
Create a joint partnership between 32Health Inc and iMC to improve oral care by building risk profiles based on predictive risk models using deep learning models on multi-Modal data. The mutual partnership entails working together to achieve the goals outlined below.

**Goals**
**iMC Goals**
1. Improve the efficiency of dental care delivery and make it more personalized, accurate, and timely using multi-modal data and machine learning technologies
2. Provide anonymized patient data for developing clinical risk models to augment clinical decision support and potentially clinical outcomes
3. To use developed data to create intelligence about performance information, about commercially available products, treatment procedures and insights to support clinical decision products. Such intelligence may be monetized with third parties per the revenue model share that will be finalized post Phase I of the Project
4. To provide leadership in oral care through scientific communication based on evidence and insights from AI-derived data models.
5. Create possible risk and prognosis calculators and clinical decision support products.

**32Health Goals**
1. Create and build a database of data sources for digital oral health that include multiple modalities, such as electronic dental records from clinical treatments, radiology images, clinical notes, photographs, intraoral images, and other associated information. While historically, these data were used in silos, new machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) technologies enable the integration of these data sources to produce multi-modal insights.
2. Using multi-modal insights on longitudinal data, create clinical risk models, cost models, and appropriate intervention models that may lead to better patient outcomes and optimized costs.
3. Use risk models to predict the cost of more effective dental care at individual and population levels.
4. Co-develop products with iMC that augment dental manufacturers sales and marketing efforts by using our AI risk system to promote the use of potential products in the marketplace.

**Use cases for multi-modal data sources for oral care co developed with iMc**
1. Improved individual periodontal and caries risk assessments
   Compute caries and periodontal disease risks and their progressions from multiple sources of data to compute risk scores that are repeatable, reproducible, and replicable to formulate care recommendations.
2. Improve the prescription of disease severity assessment
   Using multi-modal data from clinical practice to derive insights into oral care to enable more precise clinical decision-making. Each modality has its own special case, fusing modalities (e.g., image data, periodontal charting data with clinical data) to affect patient outcomes and theoretically enable better oral and surgical treatments.
3. Enhance clinical care recommendations
   Multi-modal data fusion is used to detect disease and risk classification and make automated care recommendations about the oral disease.

**Data collection, processing, and modeling process**
The partner shall work with iMC's clinical partners to acquire data composed of, at a minimum: clinical treatment data, imaging data (x-rays, periodontal charting, photographs, clinical notes, chart notes), and any other available data describing patients' features such as social determinants of health, lifestyle, demographics, medical comorbidities, behavioral data from multiple general and specialized treatment locations. The overall process of acquiring data and generating outcomes from each site is shown in Figure 1. The data-contributing locations shall establish a regular cadence for data refresh regularly, at least once in three months.

32Health shall implement multiple layers of data processing, aggregation, and prediction modeling. 32Health shall implement data quality protocols for feature extraction of clinically relevant data factors from unstructured data. This shall include implementing a framework for data processing for data filtering, removal of duplicate and inconsistent data, and handling missing data. After pre-processing, deep learning models are applied to predict disease presence, progression, and other outcomes of interest. The schematic business and technical process are laid out in Figure 3 below.

```

**Definitions**
*   **Data Discovery:** During this phase, data is analyzed to understand what type of data (e.g. images, claims etc) is available, what portion of the data is digital, non-digital, where they reside (on-site/off-site) and what custom software development needs to be accomplished to pull the data.
*   **Digital Data Pull:** The data is pulled from the sources identified in Data Discovery to perform de-identification and the data is stored for the 32Health System.. Figure 2 describes in further detail on how the data pull is performed.
*   **Data Validation/Review:** Validation of all the data and final review of the data to ensure the data is in correct format and readable by 32Health System.
*   **Non Digital Migration** - All the data that is non-digital will be migrated into a digital version of the data.
*   **32Health System:** Reads and analyzes all the data collected, builds the AI model and computes the Risk Score for each Patient.
*   **Patient Risk Score:** Database that contains all the patient's risk scores that was computed by the AI model on 32Health System. Figure 3 describes in further detail on how the risk scores are calculated.
*   **PMS DB** - Practice Management Database system of individual sites/affiliates (could have multiple sites if they are owned by the same affiliate) that has data associated with the patients.
