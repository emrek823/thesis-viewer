## Page 1: Payment Accuracy

# Payment Accuracy
## Unlock value and improve performance across the payment cycle with one partner

Meet the new Cotiviti, a company forged from two industry leaders: Verscend and Cotiviti. We apply multidimensional analytic insights, deep market expertise, and high-performance services to help clients achieve payment accuracy throughout the claim lifecycle. We saved our clients more than $5 billion in 2017.

### Billing Accuracy
**Identify millions of dollars in pre- and post-payment savings**

Billing Accuracy helps you tailor, test, and execute best-practice clinical and payment policies, ensuring compliance to avert or recover incorrect payments. Our team leads the industry in payment rules development, knowledge that we share with clients to conduct post-adjudication, pre- and post-pay reviews. Savings could add up to millions.

**Billing Accuracy by the Numbers**
* Professional claims estimated savings of 1%-2%¹
* Outpatient claims estimated savings of 0.5% -1.5%¹
* 15+ years of knowledge and content accumulation
* $1.8B in 2017 total net savings²
* 10+ medical directors
* 100+ certified coding designations on the team
* 35+ MDs on our expert panel

### Clinical Validation
**Avoid improper payment of clinically complex claims, reducing another 1 percent of medical spend**

Clinical Validation is a unique market offering that adds a line of defense on top of primary editing systems. It protects against costly overpayments and recoveries caused when systems pay claim lines with modifiers that override edits. Clinical Validation applies advanced clinical and coding algorithms to nationally sourced edits and flags suspect claims that our team of nurses and coding experts review before final adjudication. We render payment recommendations within just a few hours, causing no payment delays for your providers.

**Clinical Validation by the Numbers**
* Potential 1%³ or more savings on annual medical spend incremental to primary editing systems
* 15+ years perfecting the process
* 200+ nurse code reviewers
* Implementation in as little as 90-120 days

### Payment Responsibility
**Realize 80 percent of overpaid findings as cost savings**

Our depth and breadth of coordination of benefits (COB) determination allows us to look at more members and claim types, spanning across all medical products. We provide thorough review and analysis of contracts, eligibility files, third-party benefits agreements, and other data sources to determine payment responsibility and COB. We target members with high probability of Medicare coverage using custom analytics, validate eligibility with Medicare, and work with providers to re-file claims with Medicare. Our expertise allows us to identify complex COB issues behind existing payment integrity vendors and programs; from this identification process, we build a store of comprehensive eligibility data and analytics that identify other commercial payer responsibilities.

### Contract Compliance
**Identify 40 to 60 percent more findings with expert audit and recovery services**

Contract Compliance enhances accuracy in the application of liability, coverage, and payment terms for contracted agreements. Our healthcare claims accuracy experts use proprietary analytics and data-mining tools to find overpayments that might otherwise go undetected. When we identify an error, we provide your team with full details and supporting documentation, then work closely with you to facilitate recovery—all with minimum disruption to your provider and network relationships.

**Contract Compliance and Payment Recovery by the Numbers**
* 17,000+ algorithms identify payment inaccuracies, resulting in over $3B savings for 38 clients in 2017-2018
* 200 overpayment concepts added in 2017-2018, resulting in $50M savings for clients
* Trusted partner to over 30 health plans and payers, including the largest national carries
* 20+ years of experience identifying and collecting COB overpayments

*   **Interceptor** identifies potential patterns of fraudulent or abusive claim submissions much earlier in the process than pay-and-chase activities. Identified patterns are analyzed and referred to clients well within prompt-pay requirements, avoiding costly fines and penalties.
*   **Sentinel** is our post-payment system for automated detection of potential fraud cases, billing misunderstandings and mistakes, and non-adherence to medical policies. Top payers rely upon Sentinel to evaluate, compare, rank, and score providers and members. The resulting "Index of Suspicion" ensures that SIUs receive high-impact leads for cases.
*   **Informant** is an advanced data analysis tool that supports user-controlled exploration of healthcare data to discover irregularities and isolate questionable billing/payment patterns.
*   **Commander** is our case tracking "command center" tool that helps build, track, and learn from FWA caseloads.
*   **SIU Services** include a wide range of program integrity services, from augmenting in-house staff with investigative support to providing a complete and comprehensive outsourced SIU.

### Fraud, Waste, and Abuse Solutions
**Detect and deter fraud, waste, and abuse (FWA) for up to 15:1 ROI**

Designed along with clinicians, claims and regulatory experts, administrators, and data analysts, FWA Solutions quickly adapt to emerging fraud schemes and compliance requirements. Data analysis, decisions, and insights from one module can help modify rules and algorithms for other modules, creating an even stronger, anti-fraud solution.

**FWA Solutions by the Numbers**
* Documented ROI up to 15:1⁴
* 23+ years of experience providing FWA software solutions
* Large, credentialed investigative and clinical support staff
* HITRUST CSF-certified software

### Clinical Chart Validation
**Save 1 to 2 percent of DRG spend with efficient medical record review services**

Industry-leading analytics—guided by physicians, nurses, and coders and based on clinical insights—verify that claims are supported by clinical documentation to determine reimbursement thresholds, clinical appropriateness, and proper claim payment. We also apply lessons learned serving a broad range of payers, including commercial plans, Medicare Advantage, Medicaid, and CMS, to our deeper analysis that combines coding, documentation, and clinical chart reviews, revealing higher-value errors that others may miss. Not only could your findings increase with Cotiviti, but because we pull fewer charts and deliver better results, your providers have an improved experience.

**Clinical Chart Validation by the Numbers**
* Clinical chart validation savings of 1-2% of DRG spend
* 40+% change rate to charts vs. industry average 10%
* 98% sustainability rate of chart changes
* 825+ clinical and coding concepts, rules, and policies
* Clinical staff with an average of 20 years' clinical experience per person
