## Slide 2: Our Vision

Our Vision: We help people put their lives back together after life-altering injury or illness by connecting them with some who has already done it.

TandemStride is a technology-enabled platform for peer support & assistance for complex injury/illness survivors and their families. We are starting with Traumatic Injury

## Slide 3: The Problem

# The Problem
Peer Support is a broadly accepted means for providing patient centered care; increasing engagement, reducing costs and improving quality - but there is no infrastructure!

## Trauma Care as an Example

| The Population is niche but large and complex - without engagement complexity increases and quality of life decreases | Peer engagement unlocks reduced avoidable hospital utilization, promotes care adherence and satisfaction | Despite efforts to encourage the peer support standard of care - access is hampered by a manual and inconsistent process |
| :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **11M per Year**<br>** (30K per day)**<br> Estimated # Medicaid members that experience Trauma each year            | **26%**<br> Reduction in Readmissions for Trauma Population that engages with a Trauma Peer or Trauma Recovery Services | **2022**<br> American College of Surgeons mandates Peer Support as St for all Level 1 & 2 Trauma Centers         |
| **25%**<br> of trauma survivors experience PTSD - 80% display symptoms ~6 months after hospital discharge           | **30%**<br> increase in follow up appointment attendance for Trauma Population that engages with a Trauma Peer or Trauma Recovery Services | **75%**<br> of Trauma Patients request a Peer Connection during their Hospital stay - in facilities where a peer program is offered |
| **20%**<br> of trauma patients return to the Hospital after discharge for follow on complications - 80% are readmitted to the hospital | **2x**<br> more likely to provide Highest Patient Satisfaction Rating for Trauma Population that engages with a Trauma Peer or Trauma Recovery Services | **<10%**<br> of Trauma Patients are connected to a Peer prior to Hospital Discharge - in facilities where a peer program is offered |

*   **2025:** 5,000 engaged members (8 MCOs in 1 County)
*   **2026:** 30,000 engaged members (8 MCOs Statewide)

## Slide 9: We see a clear path to $100M ARR in Traumatic Injury

# We see a clear path to $100M ARR
# in Traumatic Injury

**Revenue Projections:**
*   **$1M** Achieved by serving 4K members
*   **$10M** Achieved by serving 40K members
*   **$100M** Achievable by serving 400K members

**Our Business Model:**
*   Attractive price point w/ significant upside for value added services
*   Extremely large underserved market
*   Positioned to serve many adjacencies in peer supported care models

## Slide 10: TandemStride can reduce the total cost of care for trauma-injured patients with multiple levers

# TandemStride can reduce the total cost of care for
# trauma-injured patients with multiple levers

**Assumptions & costs**
*   13% of members have trauma-based injury events in Ohio Medicaid
*   TandemStride reaches out to 100% of the Trauma impacted members¹
    *   Outreach starts before expected hospital discharge
    *   Expected outreach timeline: 1.5 months after the event

¹: TandemStride has the resources to reach out to members based on our partnerships with trauma centers in Ohio.

**Population target stratification and Tandem's areas of focus**

**Population breakdown**

*   **Gradient 1**
    Originally had a mental health or SUD diagnosis before trauma event
*   **Gradient 2**
    Members receive a PTSD or other MH conditions (Between 3 to 6 months after discharge)
*   **Gradient 3**
    All other members without a MH and/or SUD diagnosis

**Legend:**
*   MH and SUD diagnosis = Yes
*   MH and SUD diagnosis = No

**Key focus**

**Our expected areas of impact:**

*   **Cost of care reduction** tied to recidivism and readmission
*   **Quality metric improvements for:**
    a. Initiation and engagement of substance use disorder
    b. Follow-up after emergency department visit for mental illness at 7 days and at 30 days

## Slide 11: TandemStride brings value by reducing total cost of care

# TandemStride brings value by reducing total cost of care

| | Baseline PMPM | Expected Savings <br> Based on 5% savings rate | Value per <br> Engaged Member (PEPM) |
| :------------------------------- | :------------ | :--------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------- |
| **All Members**                  | $1,570 PMPM   | $123.90 PMPM                                   | $353.90 PEPM                         |
| **Has a Mental Health Condition** (MH=Yes) | $4,593 PMPM   | $229.70 PMPM <br> (30%)                        | $392.60 PEPM <br> (85%)              |
| **No Mental Health Condition** (MH=No) | $1,504 PMPM   | $78.50 PMPM <br> (70%)                         | $134.20 PEPM <br> (15%)              |

**Assumptions** (Based on 35% engagement rate)
*   App adoption rate: 10%
*   Engagement rate: 35%
*   Reduction rate: 5% (Expecting 5%-15%)

We estimate charging $35 PEPM for every engaged member,
This represents an ROI of 10 times the fee for the expected value for an assigned population
This ROI cost is on top of the quality component ROI
