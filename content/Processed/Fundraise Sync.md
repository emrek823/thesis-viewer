### Business Update & Current Performance

- Inorganic growth model continuing to work well
	- Teladoc and Premise potentially big contracts before year-end
	- Multi Care deal: 3-year $2M minimum, possibly 5-year deal
- Year-end projections on track
	- $3M run rate
	- $4.5M bookings
- New product/service menu structure finalized
	- Core platform free (normally $100K-$1M cost)
	- All other offerings recurring revenue except connector setup
	- Focus on systematic conversion: open source → 20% paying $50-100K ARR → upselling

### Fundraising Status & Investor Pipeline

- No lead yet, multiple smaller check interests
- Need $250K immediately for third-party data purchase from Meredith
- Minimum capital needed: $2M to run through end of 2026
	- Preferred raise: $5-7M
- Key investor updates:
	- Yosemite (Canal/Matt): Canal convinced, needs 1 hour with Matt to close
	- Vouchers: Interested in smaller scale participation, meeting with Cory/Mike tomorrow
	- First Round: Meeting scheduled tomorrow, strong thematic alignment
	- KP: Slow but making customer conviction progress, proof of concept discussions
	- F Prime: Meeting Friday with Brett/Julia, dragging feet
	- CVS (Carter): No response to follow-up from week ago

### Strategy & Next Steps

- Proposed framing for conversations:
	- Position as bridge round: $5-7M now, larger Series A ($30M at $150M) in 12 months
	- Will be profitable run rate in 12 months
	- All current TAM/business model questions will be answered by then
- Immediate priorities:
	- Focus on Yosemite and Vouchers over next 72 hours
	- Close one lead to wrap remaining delta for $5-7M round
	- Acquire third-party data to enable current sales pipeline
