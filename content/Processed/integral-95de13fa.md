Introduction & Mission

Integral is a software company headquartered in San Francisco, CA. Integral’s mission is to streamline the compliance process required when working with healthcare data for analysis, research, and marketing. We enable companies to work with their desired data in hours, rather than months. This one-pager will outline how Integral works.

Problem

The current compliance process involving HIPAA experts certifying dataset combinations takes too long and cost too much. This is primarily because there is no technology to bridge the gap between the collaboration necessary between data partners, clients, and vendors and the technical analysis to reach HIPAA expert approval.

How It Works

Integral has 2 key automations enabling companies to work with healthcare data in hours instead of months.
