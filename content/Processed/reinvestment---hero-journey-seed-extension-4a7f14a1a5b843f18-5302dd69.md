## Slide 2: Key Updates

## Key Updates

**Commercial**. Monthly revenue has grown from $3,798 in November ‘22 to $39,126 in May ‘23 ($469K annual revenue run-rate). As of May, HJC has 931 current active subscriptions (up from 158 in January, with 375 paying subscriptions. Consumer metrics also continue to be robust. CAC dropped back down to near all-time low of $65-73 and average blended LTV is 30 sessions across all cohorts as retention continues to go up. LTV/CAC is up to 12.3x (8.2x net) and net payback period is currently <1 month.

**Community**. The community grew to over 7,000 members with active engagement, as its new member retention rate shot up to 33% and ended at 36%. For context, 20% is the threshold for excellent and is only achieved by the top decile of discord servers, and is the prerequisite to being considered a partner server.

**Product**. The majority of effort has been on rebuilding the matching tooling and operational infrastructure for group placements. HJC has completed a massive overhaul of this system and designed a new program/service model for lecture-based, higher-margin group "campaigns". The company has also started to design the new member onboarding experience and new product platform for Journeyers.

## Revisiting Opportunities/Risks from the Seed

| Opportunity from Seed Memo | Commentary                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| Team with Unique Advantage | HJC is not your typical virtual care delivery business where you hire providers, go in-network, and start acquiring patients. In order to successfully scale HJC during this initial phase of growth, Brian and Marc have excelled in marketing (low CAC), platform development (new infrastructure), building community (new challenges / models of game), hiring (1-2 journey guides per month), and showing early clinical outcomes (decrease in GAD-7/PHQ9 scores). It is unusual to see success across this broad array of workstreams early on for a founding team, and we are excited to see this unique advantage compound over time. |

## Slide 3: Revisiting Opportunities/Risks from the Seed (Cont.)

| Opportunity from Seed Memo                      | Commentary                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| Winner take-all, global markets                 | While HJC has not expanded globally yet because they want to stay focused, the community is already asking them to go global (e.g., UK). The "winner take-all" advantages of this market have not been proven out entirely as of yet, but the early virality of the community is starting to show early, promising signals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Cash efficient and (relatively) high gross margin care delivery business | HJC has only burned $600K of the $4M it raised in August of last year. With a weekly cost of only $30 per user, 5 users per group, and a journey guide cost of $45 per session, HJC is generating 70% gross margins. HJC business model is scalable, cost-efficient AND affordable for the patient population its targeting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| Clinician Supply                              | HJC's early focus on journey guide onboarding, session quality control, scripting of session styles, and program development for each of the new game types gave us initial confidence. The recent rate and quality of journey guide hiring to scale to its current capacity has continued to be impressive, with 7 new journey guides hired in May alone. HJC has decided to move their employment model towards a managed network of therapists, all of whom will start as part-time 1099 independent contractors with the potential for full-time employment with strong performance.                                                                                                                                              |
| Community Content Moderation & Digital Civility | Earlier this year, HJC scaled to a certain point where Brian and Marc didn't know each member's story individually and weren't able to manually intervene in case of emergency (e.g., patient with SMI needs to go to hospital). HJC has managed its onboarding process effectively to make sure those entering the program don't need more serious help, trained journey guides effectively to elevate crisis situations, and have created a community environment that doesn't tolerate bad behavior.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Maintaining virality of community             | HJC community engagement rates are above the threshold for excellence across ALL discord servers, not just for health or mental health specific communities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

## Slide 4: Risk from Seed Memo (Cont.) and Case for 10X

| Risk from Seed Memo | Commentary                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| Commercial / GTM    | HJC decided to double down on the subclinical route and not pursue reimbursement at this time given the strong traction of its D2C model. The initial hypothesis that the $30 cost for a weekly session is attractive because it is less than a co-pay for therapy has been validated. Although strong interest from a wide range of members (age, demographics, geography) validates the power of the model, the team has been more focused on a core user that is able to continually pay for sessions (25-40 year olds). |

## Case for 10X

With every reinvestment, we use our privileged access and position with management teams to re-underwrite our investment case to ensure 10x potential from its current valuation. HJC can 10x from its current valuation from doubling down on its current care model alone (projected $15M in annualized run-rate by EOY 2025). Over the long-term, HJC can create a novel mental health business with an entirely new form factor. HJC has given itself the opportunity to pursue many different futures that go beyond any virtual care model we see in market today. HJC has not yet tapped into its global demand, the potential for gaming platforms for rapid scale, and new monetization/platform models that leverage HJC tools and journeyer platform across different games and modalities.
