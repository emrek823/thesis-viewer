  The Cigna Group could deliver its employer clients at least 10% in net cost savings on their GLP-1 medication spending thanks to two recent initiatives, according to a May 23 research note from Guggenheim Securities analysts. Meanwhile, Deutsche Bank analysts in a May 23 note wrote that Cigna expects to reduce the net cost of GLP-1 prescriptions by up to 20%. Both Guggenheim and Deutsche Bank analysts met this month with Cigna executives and discussed their approaches to managing GLP-1s and other topics. 

  Cigna’s Evernorth Health Services subsidiary on May 22 [announced](https://aishealth.mmitnetwork.com/blogs/health-plan-weekly/cigna-s-copay-caps-add-to-growing-suite-of-solutions-to-glp-1-cost-concerns) that it had struck deals with Eli Lilly and Co. and Novo Nordisk to cap Zepbound (tirzepatide) and Wegovy (semaglutide) copays at $200 per month for plan members, which could save members up to $3,600 per year compared to buying the weight loss medications directly from manufacturers.
