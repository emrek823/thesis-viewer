Encap Health is the trusted after-visit digital companion for patients.

*   A sudden illness, 40+ doctors, and a friendship with his cardiologist led to our CEO leaving Amazon Healthcare to improve the after-visit experience for patients.
*   Patients today get little to no follow-up after leaving the doctor's office - leading to poor health outcomes, higher payer costs, and burdens to providers.

## Slide 3: We are a mission-driven team with the healthcare experience to build a multi-billion dollar digital health business.

Our Beta is a personalized visit summary.
Long-term we have ability to transform a market.

**Current Beta**
*   Automated, personalized, and actionable plain-language content sent out to patients based on their ICD-10 codes
*   Coverage of ~65% of patient visits (300-500 patients / week) in 2 clinics and 8 providers
    *   Open Rate: ~70%
    *   Click Through Rate: ~20%
    *   Patient Survey Respondents: 120+

**UTI FAQs and Other Tips**

DAVID - thanks for being part of Lake Country Medical Group. As an extension of care from your office visits, we hope you enjoy the educational FAQs and information we include in this email - it is part of a trial program to improve patients' health. Please help us improve this new trial program by taking this 2-minute survey.

For appointments or other questions, please contact the office at 706-485-4004. This content is general information and not specific medical advice or an individual care plan. Any recommendations are informational only with no financial compensation.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

1.  **What is a UTI?** Urinary tract infections are infections of the urinary system, including the kidneys, ureters, bladder, or urethra. Most infections involve the lower urinary tract - the bladder and the urethra. UTIs are more common in females, and more than half of women will have a UTI in their life. If left untreated, UTIs can lead to serious health problems, including repeat infections, permanent kidney damage, or sepsis.
2.  **How do I know if I have a UTI?** UTIs can be diagnosed via a urine sample at your doctor or an at-home test. UTI symptoms vary based on where the infection is (kidney/bladder/urethra) but can include: pain or burning when urinating, pungent-smelling urine, back or side pain, pelvic pressure, fever, and nausea.
3.  **What can I do right now to treat a UTI?** UTIs are best treated with antibiotics. While you wait for the antibiotics to work, you can manage symptoms by hydrating, using a heating pad, and taking OTC painkillers. See below for more info on treating recurrent UTIs.
4.  **What about recurrent UTIs?** For recurring UTIs (multiple per year), antibiotics may be be less effective, and additional treatment is needed. Renal stones or bladder stones may be causing infection, or you may have antibiotic-resistant infections. Your doctor can test to see if these may be contributing to your recurrent UTIs. See the Other Treatment Tips section for more info.
5.  **Are UTIs more common post-menopause?** Yes. UTIs are more common and more severe as women age. As estrogen declines, the vaginal microbiome changes impacting your body's natural defenses. It is estimated that 10-15% of all women over 60 have recurrent UTIs, making UTIs the most common reason for antibiotic prescriptions in older women.
6.  **Can men get UTIs?** Yes. UTIs are less common in men as men have a longer urethra than women, which acts as a natural defense mechanism. Prostate problems such as an enlarged prostate can block the flow of urine and increase the odds of a UTI.
7.  **When should I seek additional care?** If you do not notice improved symptoms after a few days of antibiotics, you should contact your doctor.
8.  **Should I take probiotics/prebiotics after antibiotics?** Yes. Antibiotics disrupt your gut microbiome, and probiotics can help restore it; however, it is estimated that 90% of commercial probiotics are useless (this article discusses the *60 Minutes Probiotics Segment*). One reasonable OTC solution is *VitaMonk Probiotic* for ~$30, or you can ask your doctor for a clinical-strength probiotic. Don't forget your prebiotics! Prebiotics are the fiber that probiotics need for fuel and can be consumed from supplements (*Amazon Prebiotics*) or naturally from *foods you eat*.

**Other Tips (i.e., Diet/Lifestyle/Products)**

*   **What can I do in the future to prevent UTIs (new)?** A new company, www.Ugora.com, works to cure and prevent UTIs and has over 20k 5-star reviews. They sell an over-the-counter solution with specific nutrients (including d-mannose) and probiotic strains to support your urinary tract for ~$50. A 2022 study by NIH showed that d-mannose may be as effective as antibiotics in treating UTIs. Other startups innovating in UTI health include www.myuti.com and www.evvy.com.
*   **Do cranberries help UTIs?** Maybe. Studies on the efficacy of cranberries to manage UTIs are mixed, but some patients report a positive response. In general, it won't hurt, but you should not rely solely on cranberries. Tip - go for 100% cranberry juice and avoid cranberry juice cocktail (which has more sugar than a snickers bar!).

## Slide 9: Providers and Patients love Encap

Providers and Patients love Encap

"It's so frustrating knowing my patients forget most of what was discussed once they leave my office because of rushed appointments and lack of time to explain in layman's terms the medical message that is necessary. Encap Health bridges these gaps with actionable messaging that can be accessed by the patient beyond the walls of the clinic, providing a vehicle to reiterate the providers messaging. I LOVE THIS PROGRAM!”
- Cardiologist

"Currently I have to spend a lot of time with patients discussing lifestyle changes. Encap would free me up to do at least one additional procedure a week.”
- Gastroenterologist

**Voice of the Patient**
*   **87.5%** of patients agree “These emails help me feel empowered to take action for my health"
*   **93.75%** of patients agree “I would like to receive this type of email after future doctor appointments”

"The content on Mediterranean Diet for my high cholesterol was so helpful! Especially here in the South.”
"I was gobsmacked by the quality of the content from Encap! Please keep sending."

## Slide 10: No one is prioritizing the after-visit experience. We are building a sticky solution that providers won't want to leave.

No one is prioritizing the after-visit experience. We are building a sticky solution that providers won't want to leave.

**Existing EHRs**
**(Epic, Athena etc.)**
*   Some have outdated discharge summaries from 2009 CMS incentives
    *   E.g., a 5-10 page printout from a hospital with nothing actionable
*   Many EHRs on a % of billings revenue model; not financially incentivized for patient health and reduction in visits
*   Stale content and not AI optimized

**Startups and Health Education Platforms**
*   Most require additional steps from provider and patient to access (another app or portal)
*   Many are focused on post-surgery recovery and physical therapy (directly reimbursable, but niche)

We're seeking a $1.0m pre-seed round to accelerate growth. We will use funds to:

*   **Scale:** Scale to +500 independent providers reaching +500k patients. (<1% of target providers on web-based EHRs)
*   **Improve Health Outcomes:** Run studies to prove Encap can improve health outcomes, building case for adoption from payers and larger health systems. Two pilots launched in April 2023
*   **Launch Additional Revenue Streams:** Launch premium provider features (% of new billings) and advertising revenue to become cash flow positive by end of year two (cash flow positive at ~475 providers).
*   **Use of Funds:** We forecast $1.0m will give us 18 months of runway with a full-time team of 4. 78% of funds will be used for headcount (60% engineering, 40% operations and sales), 12% for SG&A, and 10% for outsourced resources and professional services.
