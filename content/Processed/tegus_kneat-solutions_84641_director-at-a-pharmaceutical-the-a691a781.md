Pharmaceutical, Validation Software, Veeva, Quality Management, Cloud-based Solutions, Market Comparison, Validation Processes

## Summary
The Tegus Client speaks with a Director at a Pharmaceutical Therapeutics Company about validation software and procedures. They discuss the key validation procedures for opening a new facility, including qualification and validation life cycle management. The Director highlights the strengths of Kneat, such as its user interface, user experience, and integration capabilities with other systems. They also mention that Kneat is a specialized validation life cycle management software, while Veeva offers a full suite of solutions. The Director explains that Veeva is widely adopted but can be expensive and lacks advanced features, while Kneat offers a simpler and more scalable solution. The choice between Veeva and Kneat depends on the organization's needs and preferences. The Director also discusses the use of other software systems like TrackWise and Qualio in ex-US operations. They express optimism about Qualio's collaborative features but mention potential cybersecurity issues. The Director provides insights into the addressable market for Kneat within the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries, estimating a market size of around $10 million for software and services related to validation. They also mention that Kneat remains small and focused, with a unique compensation package for employees. The Director rates Veeva highly but suggests areas for improvement, such as customization and data validation. They see potential for Veeva to compete with companies like Kneat in the future.

**Tegus Client**
Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today about the validation software market and different players that serve that industry and wanted to have a conversation with you about really kind of validation as a practice and kind of how different software vendors can help there. To start off, could you please give us a quick overview of your background and experience in this space?

**Director at a Pharmaceutical Therapeutics Company**
Yes. I have worked in the pharma space and extensively in validation, but also the tools of action RFP, et cetera. I can speak to the players, about just overall competitive landscape.

I have a PhD in biochemistry, and I have been in the pharma industry for over 10 years. I used to work at a CRO/CDMO to help pharma companies customers to make the drugs, but also to perform preclinical studies, including toxicology, dose-finding studies to really submit drug filing into R&D.

A lot of validation was ongoing at the time because we were trying to cater to multiple customers. I was a validation strategy lead, and we were adopting a third-party tool leader at the other time. I think it was the company called Spartan.

But we have some home-grown version before that. I can talk about the transition. But earlier I worked at a large pharmaceutical company. We have had three facilities around Boston. I was in charge of all three when it comes to greenfield build-out of facilities, and it might they to you facility, clean rooms equipment et cetera. We were using Veeva Vault. I think it's called QualityDocs, but also Veeva Vault later have other options at the time. I was involved actually in selecting Veeva.

We were actually using Medidata at a time, which helped with a bit of validation, but it was a full validation suite for Veeva at the time. That was like 2017 to 2020. And in the past three to four years, I have been working in the mRNA industry at a Pharmaceutical Therapeutics Company.

I was working both internally the same role, but as well as for external CDMOs because we know my current company is using a lot of outsourcing. And I was helping our CMOs to really grow into GMP compliant and many of those are involving selecting tools for them.

**Tegus Client**
If you could tell me a little bit more about if you're opening a new facility today, and kind of you are in charge of that. What are the key validation kind of procedures that you would want done? And then why don't we just start there and then we could talk about kind of software that could help with that next, which is understand kind of what needs to be done, who's typically in charge of doing that and kind of just the scope of validation work.

**Director at a Pharmaceutical Therapeutics Company**
Of course. Validation in nutshell have two stops, the first stop is called qualification. Qualification is like lower level. This means IQ, PQ and OQ, the installation, operation, and performance qualification. And then the second step of validation is literally the validation life cycle management. Or think about to really have documentation for inspection purposes when you try to get something into the commercial space. Now back to your question when you have rented a new space. The first thing is to really say the space is GMP compliant.

If we're making a drug or a vaccine that are used by human, it has to be GMP compliant. There is a guideline out there called ICH, International Council for Harmonization and the FDA is following that.

You already have to look at Part 11 documentation to see how you should validate your, for example, clean room, your environmental monitoring or particles in the air, viral particles and really based on the risk assessment as well, if you're making something out of echo light out of fermentation, then you have to monitor things like micro plasma, bioburden, and endotoxin.

If I'm making things out of, for example, monitoring cell culture actual, you have to monitor for the indigenous derived viruses the not the mass viruses. So that's really in there. But besides the clean room, environmental monitoring validation, which actually starts from qualification to validation, but also you have to validate your process.

So no matter what you make because you have a manufacturing process. So how do you validate your manufacturing process to eventually have a documentation to say here I am making five to 10 batches.

The fact that batches, I can demonstrate that the predefined NOR and PARs, so NOR stands for normal operational range, PAR stands for proven, yes, whatever. And so those are actually to be confirmed as consistent at scale manufacturing. After all, you use tools like Kneat or Veeva to draft this documentation. It's always going to be a documentation starting from risk assessment to say what is more critical for you to validate to now let's have a plan.

One, two, three, four, five from clean room to equipment. And then you have these individual SOPs to follow to say what you need to do, for example, what assets used to validate your process in terms of defect in operations. And for you final product you make, what is your specification, you are following from your initial first development here, you want to reduce your drug? And eventually this comes to a PPQ process performance qualification reports.

People call this also PV report process validation report, but that's really to wrap up everything. So after that, if you're filing with FDA is also getting approved or close to approved, FDA will come on site to do a PAI, which is pre-approval inspection. So you show them everything you have done in terms of the documentation in the Kneat system or in Veeva. They would also do some tours facility to check out if everything you have paper is what you're actually doing. Then they will go back and they will approve your drug for example.

**Tegus Client**
Maybe starting with Kneat and Veeva, whichever one you think is better to start with, I was just curious kind of when the last time you evaluated a system like this kind for and I was curious what strengths and weaknesses you see with what each vendor is doing. So kind of what you think they're doing well, where they're lacking. I think maybe just starting with a bit of general observations from you on maybe we start with Kneat, that would be great. And then we could talk about Veeva next.

**Director at a Pharmaceutical Therapeutics Company**
Yes, of course. So Kneat solutions, the last time I used this was probably within half a month. So we have had this initiative. So we are trying to develop facilities in countries like Canada, Australia, and South Africa. So this is really to move away from relying too much on CDMO, which can be too costly now after the pandemic and drop of sales of COVID vaccine to really rely on the local facilities with government subsidies.

For example, money from Justin Trudeau's government to really do that. And that motivation was down for a facility in Nova Scotia facility in Canada. So we have done, I think, three kits validation. So a kit means you have a train of operations literally from end-to-end from the IVT reaction all the way to purification. So we validated the whole train of up to 20 equipment through each train.

And like I said, we do the PV study. So process validation study. And we did a point and shoot, which means we pointed five batches. And when we shoot, we literally have all the performance data together in the reports.

Everything is in Kneat Gx, I believe that's the software you will be different parties starting from regulatory CMC regulatory to really from a plan to the actual validation team to exactly the plan, collecting data from our manufacturing operations team and QA have to literally remain, yes, do audits through the audit trail and remain compliant.

**Tegus Client**
Right. And then I think when you look at the Kneat software, what kind of do you like about it? What do you think could be better? I'd be curious what you think kind of the strengths and weaknesses as you think of them are?

**Director at a Pharmaceutical Therapeutics Company**
So if we could zoom out the company Kneat solutions is very niche company. They don't do anything else, just focus on validation life cycle management which is actually great because sometimes we don't want to have bundled sale, like come, I don't want to buy a full suite of Veeva to do it.

In my case we just go to Canada and just get it down there, and we don't care much about that because we don't even keep a G&A function in our facility. We just make it so that it's ready to go for manufacturing, that's it. So it's very specialized e-validation life cycle, like I mentioned.

Which means it can be extremely cheap if you just serve that purpose. If we zoom in on the software it is off, the Kneat Gx. It's a very good user interface. I don't know if you've ever used those touch screen type of software ever in the pharma space. So those are literally full proof. Like if you are doing something wrong, they will actually tell you like literally following the learnings of other users and your company's own behavior, over time things if they can capture it early or it can avoid disaster or delays.

So user interface, user experience is pretty good. And also, this is relatively smart technology. So I think there are some AI behind everything, but I think learning thing it's literally AI. And also, it's actually pretty productive. So validation engineer can generate the template literally from their templates library, and it can do a expense or something like they can expand this to our equipment in a whole train.

So someone I worked with worked under me for that project used to use Veeva Vault in Boston facility at my current company to validate the same train, like he spent roughly three months to get all the communication started and he was telling me he only spent like 2x using Gx's like this is my boy.

So now if we move away from software to solve, I think the integration capability between the Gx with other systems that we have in the plant, for example, we have a quality management system. It's called TrackWise, which is also the Spartan company's product, where we document deviation, whatever.

That's actually a fully integrated application interface between the two. And also, we do have some SAP S/4HANA, I believe, it's called the ERP system, enterprise resource planning. So we have that also being fully integrated. So you don't see that same thing happen with Veeva. Veeva is literally telling you, "Oh, don't use other software, just use us, right"?

So Veeva has everything. So that's really very flexible. Yes, when you scale or when you grow out of your old capacity to the new capacity, you can always scale back or scale up if you need to with no additional cost incurred.

**Tegus Client**
Yes. And then I'd just be curious about Veeva. Maybe we talk about them a bit next and then we go back to Kneat. I'd be curious what you've seen from them in the validation space and kind of how what they do compares to what Kneat does?

**Director at a Pharmaceutical Therapeutics Company**
Yes. So I have been using Veeva for the past five years. I was very happy that we have Veeva as a company growing as a major competitor to the other content management software, including Medidata, and Veeva is becoming like a very user-friendly that's a cloud-based system. I think they were based on Salesforce and now they're moving away to be on Vault.

But that whole user experience at that time was really unparalleled. But today, you have Kneat, Kneat is better. By saying that, I still want to say maybe 80% of the top 20 pharma companies in the world have adopted Veeva to some extents.

If not enterprise level tool, at least for validation or for maybe training or for maybe thinking about them, regulatory information management as well, so Veeva has been really famous and also no brainer. If a company grows into a big pharma company, like they don't want to go around and they just go use Veeva. So there's no risk to go around if you just choose Veeva.

The problem, however, is Veeva is marketing as use cross-sell across its module, and you have to pay expensive license to get the full suite, but also in terms of the specialties. The differences within lie in the Veeva specialization and scope is different from Kneat Gx. So Kneat Gx if I can summarize very quickly again. So they are heavily specialized in validation lifecycle management.

They're not doing anything else. This can make it a very preferred choice for organizations, just looking for the dedicated validation solution when they don't have anything else. But Veeva offers a broader suite of life science focused applications, starting from quality docs to RIMs to even customer relationship management to something with commercialization, clinical trial management software as well.

So those are more suitable for organizations seeking an integrated solution with in for multiple processes beyond just validation. But zooming Veeva itself, I think it's a bit outdated being related to using the Gx today, simply doesn't have all those fancy AI or like smart features at all. There's no suggestion if you do this or you should avoid a failure by not doing this at all. Veeva is vast interactive, it's more straightforward and act as a workflow tool.

So like we all know e-validation what you should do first, second and third. So Veeva provides you that platform but you as an owner, you have to literally invite all the parties at that right time for doing the drafting, doing the review, doing the data collection, doing the final auditing.

It can be a very steep learning curve for anybody in the organization. I know a validation engineer takes roughly six months to be able to fully use Veeva validation by his or her own. But if it's Kneat Gx right, it's just one month of time of training.

Someone used to supervise as an intern, yes, this guy is pretty smart, but he only took about one month. I can't say that's for sure there's an average time of learning curve, but Gx, it's just simpler. That's really the software-software comparison, company-company scope comparison, but also how the industry views the two.

**Tegus Client**
Yes. And so I think one thing that would be helpful would be to understand kind of some of what you mean by kind of the smart features and kind of why it would take one month to learn Kneat versus six months in Veeva, maybe a little more explanation there would help.

**Director at a Pharmaceutical Therapeutics Company**
Of course. So the smart feature is literally the Kneat Gx is more digitalized, let me tell you there's four things. The first is, when you want to start a new validation, you have to draft something called protocol. The protocol is literally for people to follow. But also, it involves parties which step, who should be included and who should not be included.

For example if you don't want include QA in the first step, we just define it in a scope, but you want to have QA on board when you are doing this final audit team to ensure that the report is QA reviewed and approved. So that's not really easy to start on having these libraries what is in the report templates in there. I believe Kneat has learned from working with companies like Merck, Roche and also BMS in the past to have these identified and ready to go with other customers. Just really speedy implementation, and also, it's very scalable.

Whether you are doing one documentation, just for one equipment or maybe life cycle management of the equipment or you're doing for 100 to get a new facility up and running. It takes roughly, I won't say the same amount of time, but like I told you previously for my example of my colleagues, it's like pretty scalable and pretty efficient. So that's that. Number two is nobody is doing the same thing every single time for validation.

Sometimes you are doing this for, like in our case, lipid, or the RFP, sometimes you're doing this for the API or mRNA manufacturing. So we need to configure in the workflow, but also in terms of the workflow itself, we need to have add-ons, so we want to be able to analyze how we are doing as a validation team, and we want to recreate additional processes, documentation because we are doing things which is not happening before, we're doing the mRNA.

So FDA does have new guidance on mRNA, CDC as well as the world health organizations. So that's really the workflow, as templates again right templates again, but this is really smart piece is they can actually suggest based on whoever your colleague was starting that first configuration suggest to all the other colleagues to really use something innovative or actually makes sense as a new process.

And I think I don't have to mention too much about the third party, which is they're pretty easy in terms of the user interface and the user experience is good. But lastly, if Kneat have actually a team though it's not too many people.

I think 20 or so customer service, but they have a customer success manager type of person to make sure that you're training, you're onboarding of new employees or even think about your drafting of sell teams out of your own training department. Those are all full proofed and also to help you transition from, for example, using paper to using Kneat, if you used to use paper in the past.

**Tegus Client**
And so when you're looking at kind of for validation use cases in your organization what software do you see used as a software, kind of Kneat or Veeva or something else or paper? I was curious kind of where it sits today and where you think it will go over time?

**Director at a Pharmaceutical Therapeutics Company**
Yes. Two quick examples. When it was in the pharma space one of my former companies, we largely used paper. And the reason is because they have factories in China. So we have a global footprint of facilities. And in some countries where there is, first of all, some geopolitical tension. So digitalized sometimes means you are under surveillance. You don't want to be watched by China Communist Party, for example. So you have no choice but to do paper. But there are other reasons, big pharma, when the QA department was really old school people hired from the baby boomers.

So they just don't want to use digital platform. They want to have this stack of paper to be reviewed, like they literally tell you today, I have reviewed this three feet of paper stack, something like that.

That's really how the QA department was doing their own metrics. Really in the big pharma, it was from paper. But the transition happened around 2014, ‘15 when Veeva was out there for use. And Veeva was just by mind blowing and people, like those old baby boomers actually become big fans of those using Veeva because they would actually use Veeva for other things.

So it's actually pretty centralized and streamlined to also use Veeva besides making SOPs, but now to also do validation. And they actually have a pretty good metric being calculated in Veeva too, like those managers won't worry if they don't know who the top performer is, who is really lacking behind.

So which actually works out. So you see those issues have literally been addressed by Veeva and by the time I left this company, I think the Kneat was actually being used already, but Kneat was not necessarily that competitive because the company was based on enterprise platform of Veeva, the group only used Kneat was the group, I believe, in EU5.

So we have three or four factories in Italy. Yes, I think France, Italy, Germany, those five biggest EU countries. And actually, we are doing the demo and then start to use Kneat. But in the U.S., we actually were not using it at all. But I think in the case of my current company because it started to become a commercialized company in 2020 for the vaccine. The company was using Veeva to start with.

And the reason why we started to use Kneat, like I mentioned, is really because we are changing our strategy to really rely less on a centralized validation platform, but more on the so-called satellite-based platforms which is actually pretty good because Kneat is like, as I mentioned it's just on the point, you don't pay extra money, but also Kneat is easy to deploy. They have a customer service team to help you with that, but also Kneat is actually very easy, yes, like shadow learning curve.

**Tegus Client**
For example, one of these satellite offices, would these folks have kind of satellite manufacturing plants, are these people who just don't need Veeva licenses? So I guess I was wondering whether they would have access to Veeva anyway, so that paying for Kneat would be on top of paying for Veeva or whether kind of you just kind of pick and choose to pay for one license or the other for these folks.

**Director at a Pharmaceutical Therapeutics Company**
The short answer is you're right. They don't need to have access to Veeva, should be able to get these validations done. And our hope is we don't have to use Veeva too. But in one of those three or four new country factories, actually, we still keep Veeva.

I think for the first one, we have had in South Africa, we gave everybody Veeva access just because we were not sure if the factory will eventually transition to be wholly owned factory by my current company or it will transition to a local ownership for example, by the government.

We were not very sure. We thought maybe my current company will remain in full control, and we will just keep people with full access with everything we use in Boston. That was the case. And by the way later we learned we don't have to, like literally, African government can take over or even think about making this joint venture, we don't have to have everybody in that country have access to Veeva and we don't have to.

So they get medicine in time and then they follow a local or factory specific holding management system the Kneat system for valuation new stock. That's fine. So we did that with Canada, we did that with Australia. So it's like a slow evolution of understanding of the overlap as well as individuality of software.

**Tegus Client**
Right. And for the sales system at least in the U.S., are those contenders for Kneat being used there as well? Or is it more kind of just these new kind of the newer facilities? And in the EU countries, I guess the ones that are not kind of in South Africa or kind of Australia?

**Director at a Pharmaceutical Therapeutics Company**
I think internally my current company's own facility, for example, the ones in Boston because Veeva is like so rooted into the daily operations, we actually estimated the cost for switching to some other third party, it was actually another solution. It will take us maybe six months to finish and also will cost us between $5 million to $10 million.

Just all the migrations of documentation we have in-house that's like I can't remember, like but nine million or something TB worth of documentation. That will actually require us to hire a third party to help us out, think about someone like a Cognizant or Dark Horse, those consulting firms.

So it was not worth it. But for any external manufacturing facility, we are now using to make raw materials, to make finish, like, for example, if we hire say Lonza, impossible. Lonza, for example, yes, going to a strategic partnership with us for 10 years. They have this designated suite for us. It actually makes sense to not go with Veeva anymore but go with Kneat. Again so it's really the resistance and also cost of switching is pretty cost prohibitive.

But also, I don't think there's any good third party today to help you out, really to make that shorter or make them smoother. We're really worried because we are making these commercial products already the COVID combo, the booster shots, whatever, the proto syringes in Boston facilities, where the FDA comes anytime anybody make an anonymous call, we will be in trouble.

Just because that overlap, we're not fully protected, like maybe there are transcriptional error. There is several security risks. Those are really concerning. We don't want to have FDA stop our production and tell us to really address everything and before we can start production again. So that's really a business risk and also the cost prohibitiveness that I told you to prevent this from happening for internal.

**Tegus Client**
Right. And so in these kind of other facilities like in Australia or South Africa kind of or elsewhere even, what would kind of the broader quality management system be then, which my understanding will be that Veeva kind of serves that role as well like kind of beyond validation, what systems would Kneat be paired with?

**Director at a Pharmaceutical Therapeutics Company**
Well, actually, it might be to your surprise. Actually, they don't use Veeva as much as I would expect or at least my current company would expect. They use all kinds of software. So before Veeva, I think Spartan like they have TrackWise. TrackWise is actually pretty high market share in ex U.S. operations, another tool called Qualio, I believe. Qualio is like a newcomer. But Qualio is super digitalized QMS system. We have seen good cases of site. I would say it's not too much of a competition between Kneat and Veeva for ex U.S. operations, to be honest.

**Tegus Client**
Then what's kind of good about kind of, you said, Qualio versus kind of product or it'd be just Kneat, hearing a little bit about that?

**Director at a Pharmaceutical Therapeutics Company**
So Qualio is next-generation QMS system. It's literally just a cloud-based version of TrackWise. And TrackWise is very old school, sometimes you click a button, it takes five seconds to move to the next page, which is horrible. But TrackWise has been very cheap and extremely high market share. Companies in China use those, companies in Japan use those, companies in, for example, Australia, use those. Qualio is pretty newcomers.

They are like only there for maybe a few years, but they have gained a lot of new market share. I don't know actually remember; I'm guessing maybe 10% today. For ex-U.S., in U.S., I think Veeva is like dominant one, maybe Qualio is only a 2%. But Qualio is good in the sense they are collaborative because in old days, when people use TrackWise you are focused on using TrackWise for internal manufacturing.

So your quality engineers are looking at the initiator to initiate these deviation, involve subject matter experts to help investigate and then come up with CAPA or root causes, it's not external facing. So when you are dealing with a CMO, contract manufacturing organization they might have their own TrackWise. There's no cross talking. There's no information sharing at all, which can be horrible because you will be the last one as a customer to know there's a huge issue with your manufacturing ends up with a fail pass, for example.

So that's the biggest driver for companies, both in the U.S. and ex U.S. to start adopting either Veeva or Qualio for better communication provider collaboration, but also Qualio is having its own workflow. So often times, for example, your customer like the QA team at CMO haven't fully reviewed the file tracker or data they generated, but you can get a preview or preliminary access to see what's really going on. So you can better expect how you should change your supply chain activities out there.

So this is really some benefits out there. It does, however, come with some early risks as I was aware of when FDA and EMA, which is the European FDA, expected some of those Qualio systems in, I think, EU5 countries. I don't know which one specifically, I think they actually found some issues where the software itself have cyber security "glitches". And so people can access without having to login to sensitive data, but also people have potentially too much information.

**Tegus Client**
So going back to Kneat, I was curious, when you look at kind of them as a company and what they're doing, kind of how optimistic or pessimistic or kind of neutral are you on their future, this is, I know, a bigger picture question, kind of over the next five or 10 years?

**Director at a Pharmaceutical Therapeutics Company**
I was actually pretty surprised the company there for over, I don't know, like 50 years of time right they were established around 32,000 are still this size. I have some insights, because I have a LinkedIn premium. So I can see the number of employees. You can do that too, like we can tell, they only have like 200 people right now.

**Tegus Client**
It's a very small company, yes.

**Director at a Pharmaceutical Therapeutics Company**
So like I was wondering how come. And also why don't they go IPO? I don't think they will IPO. And so the company is doing very good control over its software development. We have seen something like that in another company called NEB, New England Biolabs. But that company is not doing software.

That company is doing enzymes. So they are a private company. They actually have a very different compensation package. I think that's kind of similar to what Kneat is doing is, as an employee you don't have to pay a very high base salary. Your base salary is pretty low, but you have like extremely high commission.

So let's say, if you are able to hook up new customer or if you are able to do offering to your service, whatever. And so that's how they motivate people. So Kneat remains a very niche solution with extremely slow growth in company size, but Kneat remains pretty well positioned in what they offer, so I'm not really having this full transparency in what they're doing in terms of but from this touches, which I have from LinkedIn premium, from how I talk to their people, I've got to know their business.

I feel like they're willing to have this very strong control. They don't want to go IPO or get on another major investment firm so that they lose the control and be not able to motivate the people. So I think that executive level of people at Kneat have this idea, which is pretty fancy as they're a small company, but I don't know how scalable this can be.

**Tegus Client**
Have you spent a lot of time with their people or kind of their senior people or not really, can you maybe just kind of use their software?

**Director at a Pharmaceutical Therapeutics Company**
I don't have a direct interaction, but I have seen several RFI, like request for information. So from those reports, eventually have been generated, I read into those reports were like 200 pages. I got the sense that the company just want to remain in very strong control. Please don't quote me on that, that's only my speculation, which is why I was comparing this company to NEB, which is really another company I like a lot.

**Tegus Client**
And then I think next topic I want to address with you is just to understand how big kind of, the question we're trying to think about is how big kind of the addressable market for Kneat could be kind of within pharma and biopharma. I think that it would be helpful just to try and understand if Kneat was kind of fully rolled out in one of the large companies you've been at, like how many licenses would be needed?

And what kind of could be Kneat's revenue for one kind of top 20 pharma company be if it was rolled out really widely based on what they have? I'll let you take it kind of in a direction that makes sense, but that's what we would love your help with.

**Director at a Pharmaceutical Therapeutics Company**
Yes. I think I need to speak about their IPO. I think they have been in the IPO already by early this year, but I think the round of financing, it was not a lot from the last one before IPO. But in terms of the market, I think the market for validation today from just drugs and the vaccines from some marketing report, we actually got these by 2022, up to $3.6 billion, and this is only about software. When you think about some companies hired to do validation as a service like that's another market which is roughly $5.5 billion.

I think those numbers should be accurate from my memories. But that's literally like a little bit below $10 million overall market between software and a service. That being said, you look at the MedTech industry, so I was talking about only drug and vaccines. Let's look at just medical devices. That's another $4 billion in total with roughly $1 billion from software and $3 billion for services. And please understand the medical device is not the same as drug or vaccines in terms of regulations, which is why validation can be defined.

**Tegus Client**
Right. But I'm more kind of trying to understand from the model. So say there's like your former company say, Kneat was kind of like fully rolled out. Kind of how many people would be using it and how much would kind of you expect like a large pharma company to be paying Kneat each year?

**Director at a Pharmaceutical Therapeutics Company**
Yes, I could tell you the breakdown. So for pharma company of their size, which have about 10,000 people full time employees, they have roughly 6% of the full-time employees are in the validation team. So that covers facility to equipment. So that's 6% of 10,000 how many, you can do calculation. And we actually expect everybody to have access to these solutions if any facility is using Kneat at all for validation.

I believe Kneat has a license must buy to cover fair number of seats. So I know we do all, that's really how I see this. And the companies today were used as IAM solution, like what is I think ServiceNow, to really control or manage the number of people who have accesses, so it could be up and down.

But I think that's pretty fair to estimate that 60% of people should have full access. You expect on top of that, another 6% of people who also need to have access, not as a super user but more so as like view-only or collaborators like from functions like quality, regulatory information or like QA for example.

**Tegus Client**
Yes. And is that something that kind of 6% number kind of on the power user side. Is that something that you think could fluctuate a lot from company to company? Or is that kind of probably pretty similar across kind of the really large pharma companies?

**Director at a Pharmaceutical Therapeutics Company**
Just the fluctuation was the first worry often times people have according to the track record because I have some visibility into the actual number of seats, eventually got used because if we are getting to the extra level of tier of the number of seats, we actually upgrade their license. In DMS, I don't think they actually had to do that or in my current company. So I think it's actually pretty predictable. Let's say you have this 500 people who might need to use that.

**Tegus Client**
Is it just that 42% who those people are?

**Director at a Pharmaceutical Therapeutics Company**
Exactly. It just can't be covered, and nobody wouldn't need to upgrade your license, to be honest. And as you grow out of it, like, for example, now we have 20 facilities. If you double the size, maybe you have to. But it's pretty consistent.

**Tegus Client**
Yes. And I think next question is kind of that out of the 10,000 people like the 600 people who did full-scale licenses in the example we're talking about, would there be companies in which kind of 2,000 people need licenses or 100 people need licenses? Or is that kind of 600 that 6%-ish I mean the kind of more full-scale licenses, I think would you expect that number to be kind of consistent?

**Director at a Pharmaceutical Therapeutics Company**
So I think two points. One is for each license, there are certain number of the super user seats and certain number of the normal seats and the we-only seats. I think we-only seats is extremely cheap. So they actually come at a different price, but for a much smaller company, I would say you can pay much more.

So I'd say if you got to extremely high tier, you got this license to cover 2,000 seats for a year, per seat you actually pay maybe only half as compared to you got a license to going only cover 200 seats which is why customers are always paying cards to get to like T already because every single time if you're upgrading your license, you pay some like transaction money, whatever where you evaluate your money.

**Tegus Client**
And then I think last question on the Kneat and Veeva one more question there is, over time, I think either Veeva or Qualio, is validation software something that you think should belong within a broader quality suite kind of like the broader suite that Veeva is trying to build and maybe that Qualio will eventually try and build? Or is there kind of enough that's unique about it that it probably deserves to be its own software category?

**Director at a Pharmaceutical Therapeutics Company**
Two things. I think from my quality friend, who I have like 20 years of rapport, I think this guy was very clear this quality remains as an independent function in any companies and compromise on sharing the same suite, even think about how about Qualio is now being acquired by Veeva, becomes part of Veeva.

Finally it's not good. And that will, first of all, compromise the reporting structure in the company. So managers have to get the metrics from the Qualio part of Veeva to know how their quality engineers are doing work. They have to.

**Tegus Client**
Let me rephrase that question. It's should Qualio and Kneat kind of be in the same software? Should Qualio and Kneat kind of merge or something kind of be together? Or it makes sense for them to be kind of on their own?

**Director at a Pharmaceutical Therapeutics Company**
The answer is the latter. Just from my perspective, if you keep them in the same umbrella even though they have different names but everybody thinks, oh, this is just a Kneat. Then some pharma companies would not choose them because they want to keep that propaganda right.

When FDA comes out for inspection, FDA loves to see that your QMS is a different brand. Yes, even though there is no like statement about that or even recommendation from FDA, but this is like a common sense so they really give yourself better inspection readiness to keep them separate.

**Tegus Client**
And would you know why they feel that way?

**Director at a Pharmaceutical Therapeutics Company**
Just because they think if things are in the same umbrella, there could be too much potential conflict of interest and quality purview can be influenced somehow. They want to say your quality should be the FDA's expansion to your company. Better off, they are tough to deal with.

They are extremely tough negotiators on closing any investigation or closing any CAPA. So that's really the highest rigor they want to keep. And so under that umbrella can sometimes make things more complicated. And FDA has commented on companies who are using, for example, Veeva, yes, I think Veeva QualityDocs for both the purpose to do validation as well as to serve some of those quality deviation investigations. I wanted to say also, why would Veeva not go hard to acquire QMS yet. So maybe that's also the reason. So maybe that kind of endorses why.

**Tegus Client**
And kind of what about validation activities makes it kind of separate from kind of the broader quality activities?

**Director at a Pharmaceutical Therapeutics Company**
So validation, to be honest, by nature should not be owned by QA. It has always been owned by the operation team whether it's the manufacturing or it's the technical development team or technical operations team. So those are the people who are called project owners. So what do you validate?

It's either your process or the equipment used in a process, correct? So they are literally the owner of not only the validation work for itself, but the power users of the system. Now why would also QA be sometimes power users in the validation software is because they have to remain a visibility on the audit trail which is why they are not owner per se.

**Tegus Client**
And then I think just a question on the QA department generally or kind of the quality department generally. What are kind of folks in the quality department broadly charged with doing kind of what are kind of their main functions? It sounds like validation kind of sits somewhere else a little bit. What are kind of things the quality department is doing?

**Director at a Pharmaceutical Therapeutics Company**
So I think when you say quality, you actually referred to QA because there is also QC. So for QA, their metrics is that's also first of all, nobody likes them in the company. But they are there for a reason. So they are literally the alarmist. So they are having quarterly quality review meetings to tell each department how many R&Ds you have, like how bad your performance is and you have to catch up on things and they always are backed by the CEO or maybe say COO, the operational officer.

And so quality's responsibility is to make sure they catch issues before they become worse. But another responsibility is whenever there are issues, be flagged as deviation. In manufacturing, QA is there to review your investigation from the functional area, whether this is investigation from validation or from maybe operation or from maybe PD. They have to review your rationale and approve that to say, you found a root cause, you did a great job evaluating the impact to the product.

Also, you do have a plan to improve it or even think about correct it at this time and improve in the future. They also are going to monitor you to make sure there is an effective check to make sure everything is done. So QA function is really about the metrics. If the company's metrics go up, then QA got more bonus, but they are always there when like you have trouble.

QC is different. So QC is a smaller function that only does testing of your drug, of your material into the release. You have to meet the specification QC tell you that before you can release that to patients. So QC is like part of QA.

**Tegus Client**
Yes. And then for who are the main users for Veeva QualityDocs or for TrackWise, who are the main kind of folks who are using that software? Is it kind of the QA department or the QC department or other folks?

**Director at a Pharmaceutical Therapeutics Company**
So the power users are QA, training department, which is actually part of QA too, but training department could be a separate function in some other companies, QC because QC has to report results from their testing. And then the other power user would be, well, you know what, I think these are the most power users in actually Veeva QualityDocs.

The second tier of users, which are just mobile users are the functional area, like supply chain, TD, technical development, TO, technical operations, manufacturing. And the most tier were the only sarcastically, are actually manager level. So people who want to track their metrics.

**Tegus Client**
I think on a scale from one to 10, with 10 being high, I'd be curious how likely you are to recommend Kneat to peers of yours?

**Director at a Pharmaceutical Therapeutics Company**
I think the Kneat is nine out of 10 for its great specialty and the good management team as well as the actual frontline team to make sure success on the customer side. The one point of is I think they do not have a very good continuity as a business because they are too small or maybe sustainability that's a better word.

If they want to scale up their service to make sure the tool can be used and a company tried to switch to them, I think they might lag behind for implementation parts. So I think either they can start to collaborate with third-party implementation companies, or they want to just augment on their part will help them a lot.

**Tegus Client**
Yes. And then now kind of just a few questions to end up here on Veeva. I'd be curious when you look and I think you mentioned this earlier, because this is kind of separate from the validation conversation. This is about kind of Veeva more broadly and not on the commercial side.

Kind of what they're doing in the clinical trial space and then safety and quality and regulatory kind of the Vault suite that isn't based on Salesforce. I was curious where you see them doing things well, where you see them kind of lagging or kind of going in a direction that you don't like. Just to hear some of your general thoughts there would be great.

**Director at a Pharmaceutical Therapeutics Company**
Yes. Veeva is like standing on the shoulder of a giant that is Medidata. There is a lawsuit if you can Google that one between these two companies. Medidata sued. But the thing is for Veeva CTMS, for their clinical trial management system, that's really a replicate of Medidata, but to better user experience and also better user interface. Veeva tried to purpose their CTMS more for something called smarter trials, not necessarily traditional trials, but trials would utilize, for example, wearables, the electronic data capture, electronic clinician outcome assessments, those type of things.

And so they have a lot of IoT collaborators like companies like Medable, something like Science 37. So that's really in a better position than it is today. But Veeva is having some hard time penetrating further from their current market share into companies for extremely large pharma like Roche, like Merck, who just are big fans of Medidata.

Medidata is very old cool, Medidata is actually very robust. So Veeva is lacking some of those history or reputation to win over those top pharma company. But Veeva has pretty good penetration into, yes, like smaller pharma or biotech companies.

**Tegus Client**
And I'd be curious if you, have you been looked at kind of the EDC software or clinical trial software recently? Or is that a while ago for you?

**Director at a Pharmaceutical Therapeutics Company**
It's actually pretty recent. So I have ever since moved to a strategy role right now, obviously, the overall company software. So for EDC I think Medidata is still a very big market leader. I have some market intel to really endorse that point. But I think Medidata does have a lot of things to do now with the more difficult trials like oncology trials, like autoimmune trials because those are oftentimes adaptive trials, whether it's a platform trial where you have three cohorts to begin with, then two left, as in add two more, something like that.

So a lot of those trials are generally larger in size but smaller in operation because many things can be done in home. Medidata is doing great on adopting the adaptation of design into those. They have a lot of statistic tools in the software, which Veeva doesn't have. And those statistical tools in Medidata are really helping the decision maker in trial to be able to either scale back on the trial or maybe make it more diversify stuff like that.

**Tegus Client**
Yes. And so then is it kind of the simpler trials that are better kind of fits for the Veeva EDC product and for the EDC and CTMS?

**Director at a Pharmaceutical Therapeutics Company**
Actually, you're right. The no-brainer type of value proposition still stands true also for Veeva in this area. It's just very easy. It's just less expensive than Medidata to be adopted. Smaller companies, smaller trial sponsors tend to buy more traditional trials. And that's also true for even a big pharma company when it is only Phase I trial. Veeva is also better.

But it's never easy to think about a company will use Veeva for Phase I and then switch to Medidata for Phase II and III. And if the companies tend to use Medidata for late stage, we'll start to use Medidata for Phase I. So there's another harsh hit for penetration, to be honest.

**Tegus Client**
Right. And so I guess would you expect that the dynamic you talked about to stay as is or kind of over time, would you expect either Veeva or Medidata or someone else, some other software vendor to gain market share within the clinical trial software space?

**Director at a Pharmaceutical Therapeutics Company**
So I have two points. First one is Medidata is now part of the French company called Dassault. And so Dassault does not really like the way Medidata is attacking Veeva. But I think maybe in the near future or long future, maybe they will actually acquire each other. I think that will actually make sense.

The second point I want to make here is Veeva and Medidata, they don't have the same customer base, to be honest, they actually defer a bit in the relatively hard to please customers would use Medidata more and the easy to please or less experienced customers would use Veeva more. I think this trend won't change much. And so in the trial space, you always have these two type of customers, and they actually like each tool to their own taste, yes.

**Tegus Client**
And then I think last question on Veeva. I'd be curious, and I think this spans multiple parts of their software, but on a scale from one to 10, again, 10 being high, I'd be curious kind of how likely you are to recommend working with Veeva to peers of yours?

**Director at a Pharmaceutical Therapeutics Company**
I would have given them a seven. I think the space for improvement is definitely very clear that Veeva can make it more customizable, can make it more modular and they can be really free to maybe institutional or academia customers, they don't do that. So I think cost prohibition is one of the immediate things they can improve besides, I think Veeva does lack some depth in data validation offering to be honest. They don't have a service team to go with it, but same for trial, same for the CRM or even other things.

**Tegus Client**
Yes. Is there anything that you think is worth us talking about with regard to Kneat that we haven't talked about yet?

**Director at a Pharmaceutical Therapeutics Company**
I think this switch of Veeva from Salesforce to Vault is actually very encouraging, to be honest. I was a very big fan of Salesforce in the early days, but now I'm hating it. I think Salesforce is also having trouble. The system always have glitches. And also part of their team is now based in India. They have a really bad way to hire people and many software engineers are really not good.

**Tegus Client**
The Salesforce people?

**Director at a Pharmaceutical Therapeutics Company**
Yes. So Veeva is switching away from that, which is actually good news. We are expecting a much more stable platform on Vault to support trial and support all these docs, but also Veeva, I know they are hiring people for services. So I think the U.S. team will definitely be maybe upfront next year. So they now position themselves instead of just competitive to Medidata, they are trying to compete with companies like Kneat as well. So actually, this is good.

**Tegus Client**
Okay. Well, thank you again for taking the time to speak with us today. This was very helpful. Enjoy the rest of your day.
