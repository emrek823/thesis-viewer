## A New Real Estate Feasibility Workflow

Site PlanningDeal EvaluationConcept IterationDirect Integrations

### Plan Sites in Hours, Not Days

* Map parcels or draw custom boundaries for any typology to vet out opportunities early.
* Build out an entire site with customizable road layout, turning radius and topography data to avoid costly redesigns later.
* Visualize your site plans with 3D context to gain faster approvals.

In the design sessions, we can get to a massing or a yield that’s probably within 10 to 15% margin of error, oftentimes in 30 minutes or an hour. That usually takes weeks with a traditional design process.

### Close Deals with Financial Certainty

* Validate pro formas against actual layouts—know if the deal pencils before design begins.
* Compare design schemes instantly with real-time deal prototyping to find the best option.
* Automatically generate takeoffs for parking, infrastructure, and earthwork to assess costs early.

TestFit helps us make better decisions faster. I can run the analysis quickly on what we find in the market and go to the investment committee with confidence knowing the deal will pencil or not.

### Maximize Site Potential with 3x Iterations

* Test zoning, unit mixes, and parking ratios to uncover highest-and-best use of land.
* Generate optimized solutions instantly, then edit and refine to meet both your pro forma and design intent.
* Show clients or stakeholders multiple site options to secure buy-in quickly.

With TestFit, we can produce 2-3 times more alternative models on a fixed budget. With a $10,000 budget for building modeling, we could create 37 models, whereas before we could only create 15.

### Turn Feasibility into Action Faster

* Push approved layouts directly to Revit to streamline design and documentation.
* Export to AutoCAD, SketchUp, Excel, or PDF to collaborate easily with consultants and stakeholders.
* Share live feasibility reports and markups to keep everyone on the same page.

TestFit helps with efficient site planning; allowing us to quickly review potential sites and update in real time per client feedback. All of our clients have enjoyed the presentations & site plans created and we are excited to grow our implementation of the program.

**$90k** Savings Per Year on Feasibility

I sat down one weekend and did a 65-acre development site plan in 3-4 hours and later this complicated mixed use project in 1.5 hours. Before, it would take at least a week of back-and-forth revisions and cost us thousands of dollars.
