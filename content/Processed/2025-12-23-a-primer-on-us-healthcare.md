I’ve written about twenty industries on Generative Value. The largest, and most complex one, that I haven’t yet touched is healthcare. I’ve spent the last few months changing that. Talking to clinicians, administrators, and investors.

I’ve come away believing the opportunity for AI’s impact on healthcare is one of the most exciting applications in the world. It’s a rare opportunity for a (very) important problem to meet a new technology perfectly suited to solve it. But to lay out that case, we have to first understand the problem.

The US Healthcare System has become a $5T web of suppliers, providers, payers, and middlemen accounting for nearly 20% of US GDP:

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!M3iA!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F74cf98bb-c9f5-4655-8923-2845ece958fd_1400x900.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!M3iA!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F74cf98bb-c9f5-4655-8923-2845ece958fd_1400x900.png)

This has created an administrative burden that costs [$1 trillion annually](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/healthcare/our-insights/reimagining-healthcare-industry-service-operations-in-the-age-of-ai). Hospitals have teams of people filling out forms and documentation, in addition to the clinicians themselves. I’d include some more stats, but just Google physician burnout and you’ll get the picture.

My goal of this article is to explain (as best I can) the structure of the US healthcare industry today, the incentives that made it that way, and how technology can be a part of the solution.

In summary:

1. There’s no one problem that’s created this system; many variables have contributed to it.
2. While reform is important, it’s much harder than automating processes within today’s system.
3. That system connects the US gov’t, insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies, healthcare providers, a few extra middlemen, and patients; all requiring documentation between each.
4. That administrative burden, while well-intentioned, decreases the well-being of both providers and patients.
5. AI provides a perfect solution to this burden.

To explain the final point, we first have to understand the system today, how we got here, and the incentives for each party involved.

*Thank you to the thirty or so people I talked to in preparation for this article. If it takes that many people to understand something, it’s a real indictment of either the complexity of the system or the intellect of the one trying to understand it. I’m afraid, in my case, it may be both.*

## 1. An Overview of the US Healthcare System

I had a friend recently tell me, ‘You love those charts with boxes and arrows…I hate them.’ Well, buckle up!

There are eight primary players in the US healthcare system:

1. Suppliers like (1) pharma companies and (2) medical device manufacturers who sell to providers either directly or via (3) distributors
2. Providers like (4) pharmacies, (5) hospitals, clinics, dental offices, etc, who have (6) group purchasing organizations (GPOs) to purchase on their behalf
3. Payers like (7) insurance companies and the (8) US Gov’t

We can visualize those parties involved here:

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!q697!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F17638d23-9ae2-407d-a61f-cfc64a2ac77c_1400x900.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!q697!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F17638d23-9ae2-407d-a61f-cfc64a2ac77c_1400x900.png)

The complexity of a system and the amount of nuance I exclude in an image are directly correlated. Given the complexity of the health system, I’m likely to agree with any mistakes you point out.

### The Suppliers

Pharma companies and medical device manufacturers are the two most profitable segments of the value chain.

The vast majority of the most valuable US healthcare companies fall into these categories:

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SwOH!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fccf14a1e-1ea0-4701-bd60-c9c1394a4d73_1400x1250.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SwOH!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fccf14a1e-1ea0-4701-bd60-c9c1394a4d73_1400x1250.png)

*I pulled the most valuable companies from US healthcare indices; it’s possible a large company isn’t included in those indices.*

Pharma companies essentially act as the venture capitalists of the healthcare industry: developing drug pipelines in the hope that they find a breakthrough compound that can become a blockbuster drug.

About 10% of drugs make it to market from the clinical trial pipeline, and 1% provide half the profits to pharma companies (from the Acquired episode on [Novo Nordisk](https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/novo-nordisk-ozempic)).

So, pharma companies get a lot of criticism for being profitable, and they do have strong gross margins (70-80% for the large pharma companies). However, much of that is funneled back into R&D to fund further drug development.

Drugs have 20-year patents from filing, but since patents are filed early in development, most drugs have only 7-12 years of protection remaining when they reach the market. After which, drugs become much less profitable due to generic competition. As they say in VC, you’re only as good as your last deal (drug)!

They then sell through distributors or directly to hospital organizations. For context, [92% of prescription drugs](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2022/jul/impact-pharmaceutical-wholesalers-drug-spending#:~:text=About%2092%20percent%20of%20prescription,distribution%20in%20the%20United%20States.) are sold through distributors. It’s a lower percentage for medical devices, as they often need to provide service directly to hospitals.

The three largest distributors are McKesson, Cardinal Health, and Cencora, who run very low-margin businesses but have 90+% market share:

### Providers

Providers include pharmacies, hospital organizations, clinics, and any other healthcare provider directly serving patients. The CMS publishes annual data on National Health Expenditures, and breaks down spending by category:

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!6ESu!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb147ad29-cbc7-44c9-9c5f-f21aa6229617_1600x787.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!6ESu!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb147ad29-cbc7-44c9-9c5f-f21aa6229617_1600x787.png)

### Payers

Finally, payers are the insurance providers. The US Gov’t (Medicare + Medicaid) makes up $1.9T of that spending and private insurers make up $1.5T.

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!s07l!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd14230b8-1779-420a-bd4a-4d99bcf01500_1400x900.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!s07l!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd14230b8-1779-420a-bd4a-4d99bcf01500_1400x900.png)

According to a [2022 report from the US Census](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2023/demo/p60-281.pdf), 54% of the insurance-covered population is on employer-sponsored insurance, 36% on gov’t-sponsored plans, and the remaining 10% covered through marketplace coverage. About 92% of the population has insurance.

Now, if this were the whole system, it would be relatively straightforward. Suppliers make products, providers deliver care, and payers cover costs.

But if there’s one thing Charlie taught us, incentives rule the world. And incentives created middlemen, and middlemen created complexity.

## 2. An Abridged History of How We Got Here

Three big historical forces created today's system:

First, employers and the government became the primary payers. This started in WWII when wage controls led employers to offer health insurance as benefits, then became permanent with tax exemptions. Medicare and Medicaid in 1965 made the government a major healthcare payer, eventually becoming the largest.

Second, as the industry grew more complex, middlemen emerged to facilitate transactions. PBMs formed to manage pharmacy benefits and negotiate drug prices on behalf of insurers. GPOs formed to give hospitals collective bargaining power with suppliers. This made sense initially when the industry was fragmented; however, as both sides consolidated, these middlemen retained their power despite being less necessary.

Third, over the following decades, the industry consolidated. Pharma companies merged because drug development became increasingly expensive and risky. The "VC model" of drug discovery required firms with enough capital to withstand multiple failures while hunting for blockbuster hits. Insurance companies consolidated for increased bargaining power and the benefits of vertical integration. Now, providers are consolidating too, as hospitals merge into massive health systems to become more efficient and increase negotiating power.

This created a system of oligopolies, where every transaction requires multiple intermediaries, each taking their cut and requiring documentation to pay for their services.

## 3. Insurance & Healthcare Incentives: Why is Everything so Expensive?

Insurance seems simple enough: you get a service, the provider submits a claim, insurance approves or denies it, then the provider appeals or not, and you get a bill. On the back end though, everyone wants to ensure they get their piece of the pie.

Abridge's founder [said it well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrnLa7z3oKk): *"We're not compensated as doctors for the care that we deliver; we're compensated for the care that we documented that we deliver."*

Once that documentation is complete, it's translated to medical codes, which are then sent to the insurance provider.

Meanwhile, insurers scrutinize claims closely, and frequently deny them due to poor documentation. This creates an adversarial relationship where providers must extensively document everything to defend against denials.

### PBMs & How Drugs are Priced:

Perhaps the most contentious and complex piece of the value chain are pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). They negotiate rebates for the insurance companies in exchange for the insurance companies putting their drugs on a formulary (list of drugs covered by insurance).

Because the pharma companies know they'll have to pay a cut of their fees back, they raise prices. On average, [about 30% of gross drug costs come from those discounts.](https://www.ahip.org/resources/prescription-drug-rebates-and-part-d-drug-costs-analysis) However, they aren’t paid out as discounts, they’re paid out as rebates.

So pharma sets high list prices (known as the wholesale acquisition cost (WAC)) -> PBMs negotiate rebates -> insurance pays high list prices -> pharma pays rebates back to insurers -> PBMs take a cut of those rebates.

The fact that brings up the most contention is that two of the three largest PBMs are owned by the insurers they’re representing (Cigna/ExpressScripts and UNH/OptumRx) and the third is owned by a pharmacy submitting claims to that PBM (CVS/Caremark - CVS also owns a health insurance company):

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qf6p!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F74e992a5-7c2d-4a60-b705-9855b64f155f_640x408.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qf6p!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F74e992a5-7c2d-4a60-b705-9855b64f155f_640x408.png)

This vertical integration means PBMs are parts of the very same organizations they’re representing, and still taking a cut of prices. See operating margin of UNH and Optum:

### Hospital & Procedure Pricing

This same pricing process plays out with medical procedures, forcing list prices higher. Every procedure in a hospital has an agreed-upon price with insurers. Providers will set artificially high list or “chargemaster” prices because they know it will be negotiated down by insurers.

This creates two problems:
