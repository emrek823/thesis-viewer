If you fell unconscious in 1950, no one around you would know how to perform [CPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_cardiopulmonary_resuscitation#20th_century): it wouldn’t be invented for another 10 years.[1](https://www.scientificdiscovery.dev/p/medical-breakthroughs-in-2025#footnote-1-182773576) Or take type 1 diabetes, where survival would involve injecting yourself every day with a thick glass syringe of insulin that was extracted from animal pancreases (with [tens of thousands of animals](https://www.gene.com/stories/cloning-insulin) required to produce each pound of insulin). And [hundreds of thousands](https://ourworldindata.org/polio) of kids worldwide would catch polio each year, leaving them paralyzed, often needing an iron lung to help them breathe.

Fast forward another thirty years to 1980, and polio would be [eliminated](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/the-decade-of-the-last-recorded-case-of-paralytic-polio-by-country) in many rich countries through vaccination. Smallpox would be [eradicated](https://ourworldindata.org/smallpox) worldwide. Insulin could now be [manufactured](https://harddrugs.worksinprogress.co/episodes/100-years-of-insulin-in-15-minutes) by yeast in bulk in bioreactors, and [emergency care](https://ourworldindata.org/cardiovascular-deaths-decline#public-health-efforts-and-advances-in-medicine-surgery-and-emergency-care-have-all-contributed-to-the-decline-in-cardiovascular-deaths) would look completely different: with implantable pacemakers, AEDs, and coronary bypass surgery.

But you could still die from cancers caused by stomach ulcers, which we now know are typically caused by *H. pylori* infection and treatable with antibiotics. Or take hepatitis C – a deadly infection that causes liver fibrosis and cancer – which is now [curable with antivirals in around 98% of patients](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41575-022-00608-8).

Some of the most fatal conditions we’ve known, like [HIV/AIDS](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanhiv/article/PIIS2352-3018(23)00028-0/fulltext) and [cystic fibrosis](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2024/04/cystic-fibrosis-trikafta-breakthrough-treatment/677471/)[2](https://www.scientificdiscovery.dev/p/medical-breakthroughs-in-2025#footnote-2-182773576), are also now highly treatable; taking early treatment for them returns people to [near-normal life expectancies](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1569199323000486). Insulin treatment has [advanced](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01418-2) to the point that small wearable devices can monitor sugar levels in the blood and release insulin to stabilize them in real time.

But when I read most science journalism, hardly any of it mentions these achievements, the stream of innovation,[3](https://www.scientificdiscovery.dev/p/medical-breakthroughs-in-2025#footnote-3-182773576) or explains what is still untreatable and why. There's instead far too much hyping up of preliminary studies – what caused/cured cancer in six mice, for example – and much less about what’s changing people’s lives right now, let alone how much people’s lives have changed over the decades.

So, since last year, I’ve been writing round-ups of the biggest breakthroughs in medicine and putting them into context to give you a sense of where we are. Here’s a link to [my post from 2024](https://www.scientificdiscovery.dev/p/five-medical-breakthroughs-in-2024) in case you’re interested.

I’ve split this into three sections – the first section only includes the results of large randomized controlled trials for new drugs published in papers this year, which are closest to becoming available. The second section is about record-breaking achievements and the first patients to receive new treatment methods. And the third section is about lab research that could soon have a big impact in medicine. Finally, a personal note.

*This post is long and won’t fit in an email. As usual, [I’ll pay you](https://www.scientificdiscovery.dev/about#%C2%A7earn-a-reward-by-pointing-out-an-error-ive-made) if you spot an error in this post, except for minor typos or grammatical errors. Please let me know if you find one, so I can fix it.*

## **Clinical breakthroughs**

* Suzetrigine (‘Journavx’) became the first **non-opioid painkiller for surgical treatment** in decades. In a [phase 3 trial](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40117446/) of 2,000 patients, it reduced pain as effectively as hydrocodone and paracetamol, but had fewer side effects and doesn’t appear to be addictive. Michelle Ma has written a [great article](https://www.worksinprogress.news/p/the-first-non-opioid-painkiller) about the history of pain medication leading up to it.
* The second **chikungunya vaccine** (‘[Vimkunya](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)00372-1/abstract)’) was [approved](https://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/vaccines/index.html#cdc_vaccine_basics_what_avai-available-vaccines) in the US and EU; it’s a recombinant [‘virus-like particle’](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/vimkunya) vaccine. Chikungunya is a disease spread by mosquitoes that is similar to dengue: both can cause weeks to months of joint pain and in rare cases, paralysis. I recently had the vaccine myself because I travel somewhat frequently to India, where chikungunya outbreaks are common; all I got was a slightly sore arm.[4](https://www.scientificdiscovery.dev/p/medical-breakthroughs-in-2025#footnote-4-182773576)
* **Several new lipid-lowering treatments are succeeding in large clinical trials.** Some involve designing small interfering RNA (siRNA) to block specific genes from producing their proteins, with just a single injection that has effects for half a year or more.

  + **Obicetrapib.** It cut LDL cholesterol levels by an additional 30% in people with a history of heart disease or familial hypercholesterolemia, who were already on the maximum doses of statins and other cholesterol lowering drugs, in a [phase 3 trial](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2415820) of over 2,500 people. The drug inhibits the CETP protein, which moves cholesterol between lipoproteins and the blood.
  + **Enlicitide.** It cut LDL cholesterol by an additional 59% in people with hypercholesterolemia who were already taking statins or other lipid-lowering drugs, in a [phase 3 trial of over 300 people](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2841258). Merck is now testing its effect in a broader population. The drug inhibits the PCSK9 protein, which regulates LDL cholesterol uptake and has been a popular target for new cholesterol drugs, but enlicitide is the first to do so in pill form.

    *LDL cholesterol levels in the phase 3 trial for enlicitide in over 300 people with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, meaning they had an inherited risk for very high levels of blood cholesterol. People taking enlicitide had a 59% reduction in LDL cholesterol compared to the placebo group, 24 weeks after the trial began. Source: [Christie M Ballantyne et al. (2025)](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2841258)*.
  + **Olezarsen.** It cut triglyceride levels by 50–70% and reduced the rates of pancreatitis episodes by around 85% in people with severe hypertriglyceridemia in a [phase 3 trial of over 1,000 people](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2512761). The drug is an antisense oligonucleotide taken by injection each month, and works by blocking the formation of the ApoC3 protein.

    *Triglyceride levels in the phase 3 trial for olezarsen in over 1,000 people with severe hypertriglyeridemia, meaning they had triglyceride levels over 500 mg/dL. People taking olezarsen (50mg) had a 63% reduction in triglyceride levels compared to the placebo group, and those taking 80mg had a 72% reduction, 6 months after the trial began. Source: [Nicholas A Marston et al. (2025)](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2512761).*
  + **Lepodisiran**, an siRNA drug, causes a dramatic reduction in lipoprotein(a) levels. In a [phase 2 trial](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2415818) of over 300 people with very high levels of lipoprotein(a), a single injection of the highest dose (400mg) reduced their lipoprotein(a) levels by **94%** and kept them low for months. Their phase 3 trial is ongoing and expected to be completed 4 years from now.

  [![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!IaEi!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe98a348b-81b1-402e-9e11-299a0d8f81bd_2048x978.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!IaEi!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe98a348b-81b1-402e-9e11-299a0d8f81bd_2048x978.png)

  *The change in lipoprotein(a) concentration in the phase 2 trial for lepodisiran in people with very high levels of lipoprotein(a), which is like LDL-cholesterol, another risk factor for atherosclerosis. People taking lepodisiran (16mg) had a 41% reduction compared to the placebo group, and those taking 96mg had a 75% reduction, and those taking 400mg had a 94% reduction, 2–6 months after the trial began. Source: [Steven E Nissen et al. (2025)](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2415818)*.
* A **new [long-acting treatment](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-novel-treatment-hemophilia-or-b-or-without-factor-inhibitors) (‘Qfitlia’ or fitusiran) for haemophilia** was approved. Patients tend to rely on regular infusions of clotting products or similar products to prevent excessive bleeding. This new treatment is also an siRNA, and is given by injection roughly once per two months. In phase 3 trials, it reduced bleeding episodes [by around 70%](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40053895/) more than standard treatment.
* **A new cure for whipworm infections**, moxidectin-albendazole. In a phase 3 trial of around 270 children in Tanzania, a single combination of [moxidectin and albendazole](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(25)00344-5/fulltext) cured 69% of whipworm infections, meaning they no longer had detectable worm eggs in their stool, compared to 16% with albendazole alone.

  [![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!kfPC!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff5a5e60d-cd16-4492-b43c-5acbaaf7609d_682x612.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!kfPC!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff5a5e60d-cd16-4492-b43c-5acbaaf7609d_682x612.png)

  *The cure rate and egg reduction rate for whipworm infections in children in Tanzania, 2–3 weeks after taking the treatment. In the moxidectin-albendazole group, 69% of children were cured of whipworm; in the albendazole only group, 16% were cured; in the placebo group 12% were cured. Source: [Annina Schnoz et al. (2025)](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(25)00344-5/fulltext).*
* A new **antibody treatment for multiple myeloma** called teclistamab led to large improvements in phase 3 trials. So far, CAR-T cell therapies have improved the situation for patients with multiple myeloma, but they are very expensive and time consuming. This new off-the-shelf antibody treatment could offer a more scalable option that’s still highly effective. It reduced the chances of disease progression by [around 83%](https://www.nejm.org/doi/abs/10.1056/NEJMoa2514663) in patients who had relapsed into myeloma and improved their overall survival, when taken as a combination with daratumumab, which has synergistic effects, compared to the standard alternate treatment.

  *The percentage of patients who survived without disease progression over time in the phase 3 trial for teclistamab-daratumumab. In the teclistamab-daratumumab group, 83% of patients survived without the cancer progressing to the next stage; while in the control group (taking daratumumab, dexamethasone plus pomalidomide (DPd) or bortezomib (DVd)), only 30% did. Source: [Luciano J. Costa et al. (2025)](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2514663).*
* **A [portable test for tuberculosis](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.adp6411) infections** was developed. It’s a handheld device that detects DNA from the bacterium that causes TB and gives results in under an hour. It has higher sensitivity than other methods, and also meets specificity thresholds set by the WHO.
* The UK became **the first country to offer a [vaccine against gonorrhea](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cgkrx6dnkkeo)**, as a targeted roll-out for gay men. The vaccine isn’t new: it’s the meningitis B vaccine, which provides some cross protection against gonorrhea, caused by a closely related bacterium. Protection in trials so far has been [moderate](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11782638/): one dose offered around a 26% reduction in the chances of infection, while two doses boosted that to 33–40%. But the NHS estimates that, with high uptake among gay men, it could
