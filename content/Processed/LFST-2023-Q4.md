LifeStance Health Group, Inc. isn't one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).

Operator:Good morning. My name is Audra and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the LifeStance Health Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Monica Prokocki, Vice President of Investor Relations.

Monica Prokocki:Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to LifeStance Health's fourth quarter 2023 earnings conference call. I'm Monica Prokocki, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me today are Ken Burdick, Chief Executive Officer; Dave Bourdon, Chief Financial Officer; and Danish Qureshi, Chief Operating Officer. We issued the earnings release and presentation before the market opened this morning. Both are available on the Investor Relations section of our website, investor.lifestance.com. In addition, a replay of this conference call will be available following the call. Before turning the call over to management for their prepared remarks, please direct your attention to the disclaimers about forward-looking statements included in the earnings press release and SEC filings.

Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements, including statements about our financial performance outlook, business model and strategy. Those statements involve risks, uncertainties and other factors, as noted in our periodic filings with the SEC that could cause actual results to differ materially. In addition, please note that we report results using non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide additional information for investors to help facilitate comparison of current and past performance. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is included in the earnings press release tables and presentation appendix. Unless otherwise noted, all results are compared to the comparable period in the prior year. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Ken Burdick, CEO of LifeStance.

Ken Burdick:Thanks, Monica, and thank you all for joining us today. I'd like to begin by highlighting what we stand for here at LifeStance. Every day we are focused on three foundational pillars: the patient experience, clinical quality, and developing an inclusive, purpose driven culture. First, we are committed to putting the patient experience at the forefront of everything we do. Since the start of the pandemic, the country has experienced an alarming increase in the rates of anxiety and depression and as well as deaths resulting from overdose and suicide. More than 150 million people live in an area with a shortage of mental health professionals, and only 56% of psychiatrists accept commercial insurance. Tens of millions of Americans are unable to access mental health care treatment, with devastating effects on families and communities.
