## Slide 5: The Rise of PBM offered PMPM Guarantees

**Image Description:** The slide features four text boxes arranged around a central blank space, discussing various aspects of PBM PMPM Guarantees. The MavRx logo is in the top right.

**Company Logo:** MavRx

**Header:** The Rise of PBM offered PMPM Guarantees

---

**Content Boxes:**

### Why PMPM Guarantees Were Introduced
*   As drug costs grew unpredictable, PBMs introduced PMPM guarantees to offer plan sponsors the appearance of budgeting certainty.
*   Framed as a way to contain pharmacy spend, especially for CFOs and HR leaders seeking cost predictability.

### When & How They Emerged
*   Gained popularity in the early-to-mid 2010s.
*   Pitched as a benchmarkable, digestible metric for non-clinical buyers.

### The Problem
*   PMPMs are often manipulated through exclusions, narrow definitions, or rebate gaming.
*   PBMs meet the guarantee — but total plan cost still rises.

### How They've Been Leveraged
*   Used heavily by PBM sales and marketing teams to compete on "savings guarantees."
*   Presented as easy comparisons in RFPs: lower PMPM = better value.

## Slide 6: Case Study #1 The Exclusion Trap

**Image Description:** Three vertical boxes, numbered 01, 02, and 03, present a scenario, its result, and takeaways regarding PMPM guarantees and exclusions. The MavRx logo is in the top right.

**Company Logo:** MavRx

**Header:** Case Study #1 The Exclusion Trap

---

**Content Boxes:**

### 01 Scenario
A large regional employer accepted a PBM contract with a competitive PMPM guarantee.

Specialty drugs and limited-distribution medications were excluded from the PMPM calculation.

### 02 Result
PBM hit their PMPM target.
But excluded drugs accounted for 30% of total Rx spend.

Plan overspent by over $500,000 compared the "actual net cost PMPM Guarantee".

### 03 Takeaways
PMPM guarantees that exclude high-cost drugs create a false sense of cost containment.

The guarantee is technically met — but plan sponsors are exposed to unlimited specialty trend.

## Slide 7: Case Study #1 The Exclusion Trap

**Image Description:** A laptop screen on the left shows a "Rebate Exclusions" interface. On the right, there are two tables detailing AWP Discounts and Rebate Guarantees. Below, text explains "Why it Matters" and "How WriteWise Fixes This." The MavRx logo is in the top right.

**Company Logo:** MavRx

**Header:** Case Study #1 The Exclusion Trap

**Sub-header:** Engineered to Avoid Trend

**Body Text:**
PBMs don't know how to calculate Future Trend Risk & as result can't put their balance sheet at risk to protect their “Guarantees” – We Can & We Do.

Standard guarantees are marketing & sales tactics. It's priced to win the business, & designed to be manipulated.

The Market is Demanding Guaranteed Prices. The PBMs don't know how to Deliver it.

**Bottom Section:**

### Why it Matters
Exclusions are often hidden & unknown upfront.

Even when RFPs demand inclusions as requirements, Plan Sponsors & Pharmacy Consultants still miss terms buried in the contracts.that circumvent RFP

### ✅ How WriteWise Fixes This
The MavRx PBM Audit tool catches PBMs actual performance for Channel Discount, Rebate Guarantees, Rebate Exclusions, Dispensing Fees, Ingredient Costs, & Admin Fees

Our PMPM Guarantee Contracts mitigate unaccounted for exclusions.

## Slide 8: Case Study #2 Category Gaming

**Image Description:** Three vertical boxes, numbered 01, 02, and 03, present a scenario, its result, and takeaways regarding PBM drug category manipulation. The MavRx logo is in the top right.

**Company Logo:** MavRx

**Header:** Case Study #2 Category Gaming

---

**Content Boxes:**

### 01 Scenario
A national retail chain entered into a PBM contract with aggressive brand and generic discount guarantees.

The PBM reclassified several brand-name drugs as generics during the contract term to meet the guarantee.

### 02 Result
PBM claimed success on discount targets.

The reclassified drugs were more expensive than true generics.

Net spend increased, but reporting looked compliant.

### 03 Takeaways
Drug category manipulation helps PBMs show performance.

But it drives up employer spend unless classifications are clearly defined and auditable.

*PBMs also reclassify brands as generics to keep rebates not owed on generics.

## Slide 9: Case Study #2 Category Gaming

**Image Description:** Text at the top explains how PBMs use classification algorithms. Below, two boxes detail "Why it Matters" and "How WriteWise Fixes This." The MavRx logo is in the top right.

**Company Logo:** MavRx

**Header:** Case Study #2 Category Gaming

**Sub-header:** Technologically Advanced When It's Convenient

**Body Text:**
Some PBMs use proprietary brand/generic/specialty classification algorithms to help them meet contractual guarantees like discount guarantees, rebate guarantees, and PMPM targets.

These algorithms are not always aligned with regulatory definitions (e.g., FDA or Medi-Span) and can be structured specifically to optimize PBM financial performance, not plan sponsor value.

---

**Bottom Section:**

### Why it Matters
These classification tricks let PBMs technically meet guarantees while hiding true cost drivers.

Most contracts don't define or audit how brand/generic/specialty is determined — giving PBMs total control of the game.

### ✅ How WriteWise Fixes This
Explicit definitions of brand, generic, and specialty (e.g., Medi-Span, FDA)

One consistent classification for billing, audit, and reporting

Auditable drug-level data for all discounts and guarantees

## Slide 10: Case Study #3 Rebate Games, Real Costs

**Image Description:** Three vertical boxes, numbered 01, 02, and 03, present a scenario, its result, and takeaways regarding PBM rebate strategies. The MavRx logo is in the top right.

**Company Logo:** MavRx

**Header:** Case Study #3 Rebate Games, Real Costs

---

**Content Boxes:**

### 01 Scenario
A municipality's PBM touted high rebate guarantees.

The PBM heavily favored drugs with large rebates — even when lower-cost alternatives existed.

### 02 Result
Rebate targets were met.

But the formulary drove up gross spend by 18% year-over-year.

Plan spend increased despite "rebate savings".

### 03 Takeaways
PBMs may chase rebate maximization over lowest net cost.

Plan sponsors need net cost guarantees — not just rebate optics.

**Quote:** "High Rebates, Higher Net Costs"

**Footer:** PMPM GUARANTEE CASE STUDIES

## Slide 11: Case Study #3 Rebate Games, Real Costs

**Image Description:** Text at the top explains "The Rebate Illusion." Below, two boxes detail "Why it Matters" and "How WriteWise Fixes This." The MavRx logo is in the top right.

**Company Logo:** MavRx

**Header:** Case Study #3 Rebate Games, Real Costs

**Sub-header:** The Rebate Illusion: Savings That Cost You More

**Body Text:**
PBMs often design formularies to favor high-rebate drugs, not the lowest-cost options.

To hit rebate guarantees, they deprioritize cheaper generics or biosimilars that offer less financial upside. This inflates “rebate savings” while driving up total plan spend — rewarding volume over true value.

---

**Bottom Section:**

### Why it Matters
Plans end up paying more for medications overall, even when "rebate guarantees” are met. This creates a false sense of savings, hides true net costs, and punishes clinically appropriate, lower-cost options.

Sponsors think they're protected — but are actually overpaying and exposed to unmanaged trend.

### ✅ How WriteWise Fixes This
WriteWise flips the model by focusing on net cost over optics. Our platform evaluates each formulary decision based on its total financial and clinical impact, not just rebate yield.

We surface better-value alternatives, validate rebate outcomes against true spend, and build GoPricing™-based PMPM guarantees that align with future, not historical, cost. The result: real savings, transparent validation, and a risk model you can trust.
