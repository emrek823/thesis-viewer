The U.S. health insurance system is stupid, immoral, and infuriating. It is time to get rid of it altogether and replace it with an intelligent, modern, and efficient infrastructure befitting the American people and the 21st century. Incrementalism is not the answer, and solutions that amount to adding further fragmentation and complexity (including Medicare Advantage, ACOs, delegated managed care, and integrated managed care) ultimately obscure the need to burn it down and start afresh. I propose in this essay a novel model, “Zero-Toll Medicine,” which leverages advances in AI and blockchain technology to deliver health insurance free of toll-taking intermediaries like private insurance companies and PBMs. This scheme aims to put patients in control of their own healthcare spending, eliminate vast amounts of administrative cost and complexity, and drive far more efficient market-based competitive pricing. It is rooted in libertarian and socialist idealism alike, exploiting the virtues of decentralized decision making and markets while realizing the civilized goal of healthcare as a fundamental right of American citizenship.

**Why Do We Have Health Insurance?**

Insurance exists primarily to pool risk. We do not know at birth who will require substantial medical care over his or her lifetime, but we can be certain that many of us will. And as the philosopher John Rawls argued, we should design our society such that we would be ok being born into any particular lot in life, since none of us chooses his or her circumstances at birth. Pooling our resources to guarantee basic medical care to everyone no matter where we’re born or how our lives unfold should be uncontroversial given our enormous societal wealth.

Limits on this commitment must arise from the fact that medical care can be very costly, and so we are unlikely to agree as a nation to cover *unlimited* care for every individual without regard to how much longevity or happiness it might buy. Therefore, rationing or “managing” the amount of care is inevitable. Furthermore, we cannot be held hostage to medical care at any price, and so should desire that medicine exist within the market economy, subject to competitive forces that optimize supply via price signals.

These three goals: 1) risk pooling 2) rationing care and 3) competitive pricing, are in theory the functions of our existing insurance system. But it fails at all three.

1. It fails to pool risk efficiently because, unlike in other insurance markets, we (rightly) prohibit insurers from discriminating on the basis of pre-existing conditions, or pricing policies on the basis of individual risk (apart from generic characteristics of a patient like geographic location and age). In principle, if carriers had the ability to discriminate, they could generate profits from careful underwriting and risk prediction. But in our system, they effectively must cover any patient who subscribes. Furthermore, if we seek to maximally spread out costs, we should have the largest risk pool possible, one that includes everyone. Our current system, by contrast, splits the population into thousands of smaller risk pools, among them: employees of individual companies (self-insured employer plans), poor people in each state (Medicaid plans), retirees (Medicare), and so forth.
2. It fails to ration care ethically because this rationing is largely done at the insurance plan level. Pre-authorizations, claim denials, and benefit design are managed by plans, which amounts to their “playing doctor.” This is not a job that insurers are qualified to do, and they do not do it well. Moreover, evidence-based medicine demands that a “standard of care” dictate what care is appropriate and medically necessary, and this standard should be universal vs. varying arbitrarily across different insurers. The care that is appropriate for a patient has nothing to do with who insures them.
3. It fails to drive optimal competitive market pricing and supply because it aggregates both supply and demand into oligopolistic blocs and removes decision making power from the actual providers and users of care. On the demand side, each insurer effectively becomes a representative of tens of thousands of patients (and their employers, who hire plans and bear costs). On the supply side, large health systems and private-equity-financed provider roll ups are increasingly the counterparties in price negotiations. In other words, large insurance companies negotiate against large providers to set prices.   
     
   Unfortunately, this means relatively little true competition exists on either side. In many markets, there are only one or two dominant health systems, and they therefore have tremendous leverage when negotiating with insurers. If a plan wants to operate in that geographic market, it has little choice but to ultimately contract with these health systems and take the prices on offer. In addition to the limited choice that this model affords market participants, it also leads to opaque “omnibus” pricing schedules highly abstracted from the actual costs of underlying services. Specifically, an insurer will contract with a health system for the full range of its services - surgeries, inpatient stays, hospital-administered drugs, etc. The insurer will be optimizing to minimize its overall expected costs, and the provider will be optimizing to maximize its overall expected profits. This means that different payers negotiating with the same provider may end up with very different prices for the same services. In other words, the same product (say, a joint replacement) will have a different price depending on the patient’s insurance company.  
     
    This excessive complexity begets excessive administrative operations. Every time a patient comes in for a service, providers have to figure out who is insuring the patient and what the negotiated price will be for that insurer. Then the provider will need to bill that payer for the service and manage collections. In several states, including California, if you go to a hospital, you will discover that the anesthesiologists, physicians, and hospital itself are all different commercial entities, each with its own contracts with your insurance company, tripling the administrative billing apparatus required to get paid for your care. If this seems like it doesn’t make sense, that is because it doesn’t.

**Subsidizing Subsidies**

What I have described so far are failures of our employer-based private insurance system, which covers just over half of Americans. The other side of our system is public insurance, which covers 36% of the population in total. Among those publicly insured are 93% of those 65 and older (Medicare), 36% of children (Medicaid), and 16% of working-age adults (Medicaid). The public system is itself a patchwork of government and private entities. For example, Medicaid is run by the states, but outsources substantially to private insurance companies in what are known as MCO arrangements (managed care organizations). Similarly, Medicare is run by the federal government, but a majority of beneficiaries now choose Medicare Advantage plans, which are also outsourced plans run by private insurers. Even Traditional Medicare (the original plan that is managed by CMS and not outsourced) outsources its claims processing and assorted functions to 12 “MAC”s (Medicare Administrative Contractors), privately-owned and somewhat mysterious vendors that also engage in care rationing across Medicare patients (for advanced diagnostics, as one example).

While there are imaginable efficiencies derived from these outsourcing arrangements, you can be sure that there is also a lot of graft and toll taking. If the government lacks discipline in spending taxpayer money, private companies one further layer removed are often even less scrupulous. This is particularly true if there is little competition for these contracts. To take one [well-publicized example](https://www.wsj.com/health/healthcare/unitedhealth-medicare-payments-doctors-c2a343db), Medicare Advantage plans have pressured physicians they control to overdiagnose patients with chronic diseases in order to receive larger payments without delivering correspondingly valuable incremental care. The entire premise of Medicare Advantage is in fact questionable insofar as the government pays plans a premium beyond typical Medicare costs to manage each patient. The last government [MedPac estimate](https://www.medpac.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Mar24_Ch12_MedPAC_Report_To_Congress_SEC.pdf#page=4) is that we are spending $83 billion more than we would in Traditional Medicare to cover Medicare Advantage members.

In spite of this waste, Medicare and Medicaid still pay artificially low prices to care providers. And the majority of hospitals, including all non-profit hospitals, must accept these prices in order to qualify for their tax exemptions. The result is that many providers serve public-insurance patients at a financial loss, and therefore need to make up for it with private insurance patients. In other words, private-insured patients provide an enormous subsidy for public-insured patients. In fact, private payer prices are oftentimes negotiated explicitly as multiples of Medicare rates. This also drives a perverse incentive for hospitals to manage their “payer mix” in favor of patients with private insurance. While many hospitals take seriously their obligation to the common good, it is simply a fact that their financial health is imperiled if they take care of too many poor people.

The subsidies run in the other direction, as well. Since employer-based insurance is a tax deductible expense, all taxpayers are subsidizing private insurance. And as economist Uwe Reinhardt pointed out, since employer-based insurance is a form of compensation, the deductibility of these premiums amounts to a regressive tax policy because the tax avoided by high wage earners (on “insurance compensation”) would have been at a higher rate than the tax avoided by low wage earners.

In short, employers subsidize public-insured patients, taxpayers subsidize employer-insured patients, and we redistribute wealth from lower to higher income workers in the process. These convoluted cash flows makes it exceedingly difficult to calculate precisely who is getting screwed most. But the short answer is: all of us.

**Radical Simplification**

A smart and modern healthcare system would achieve the following goals:

1. Enable every American citizen to afford a satisfactory level of medical care
2. Ensure that medical care is evidence-based and transparent
3. Create robust competition among healthcare providers and pharmaceutical companies to win the business of patients, driving efficiency, patient experience, and innovation

Decentralized ledgers and smart contracts, technologies originated in the cryptocurrency industry, enable a new model of American healthcare capable of meeting these goals with a radical new open insurance and payments system, “Zero Toll Medicine” (ZTM). Here are the building blocks of this system:

---

1. **A new, open blockchain protocol, ZTM, on which every US citizen and healthcare provider would have a wallet. This wallet would function as a bank account specifically for government-funded healthcare spending and receipts.**
2. **A minimal federal government health insurance agency, which could replace CMS. This “agency” would primarily comprise a computer codebase governing its interactions with the ZTM protocol and participants, but would inevitably require some number of staffers to manage activities in which human judgment is unavoidable.**
3. **A ZTM stablecoin pegged to the US Dollar.**
4. **A library of composable smart contracts enabling programmable payments in the stablecoin.**
5. **[A computer-readable standard of care.](https://www.statnews.com/2024/10/18/da-wallach-chester-french-time-bioventures/)**

The aim of this system would be to directly fund patient wallets when they require basic medical care, and to enable them to shop and directly pay providers and product manufacturers for this care with no insurance companies, PBMs, or other intermediaries. The system would also allow patients to further fund their wallets with their own money (or supplementary insurance payouts) in order to spend it on services and products beyond basic care.

**Basic Care**

The term “basic care” is of course ambiguous and loaded. There is no alternative but for the country to determine what level of care it deems worth covering for every person, and this is a political and ethical decision, not a technical matter. “Basic care,” then, amounts to whatever care can be paid for with the country’s total public health insurance budget divided by the number of its citizens, with the caveat that spending would end up unevenly allocated according to individual patient needs (as with payouts for all insurance).

In 2023, our country as a whole spent an estimated $4.9 trillion on healthcare. And at that year’s level of taxation, the federal government took in about $4.5 trillion of total revenues, of which it spent roughly $2 trillion on Medicare and Medicaid. In other words, the government currently covers about 40% of our total healthcare budget and employers/employees cover about 60%. That latter 60% is misleading since, again, taxpayers subsidize healthcare costs through the tax deductibility of employer-sponsored premiums and subsidies for exchange plans (Obamacare), to the tune of $[300bn per year](https://www.jct.gov/publications/2022/jcx-22-22/). In other words, we currently socialize about 50% of total healthcare spending while employees bear the remaining 50%. I say that employees bear that share b
