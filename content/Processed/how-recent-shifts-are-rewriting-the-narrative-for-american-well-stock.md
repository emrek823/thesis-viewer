What Wall Street Has Been Saying

🐂 Bullish Takeaways

TD Cowen highlighted American Well's 3Q adjusted EBITDA beat and guidance raise as evidence that execution on cost controls is ahead of expectations, supporting the company's reiterated 2026 cash flow breakeven target.

The firm views management's clear focus on cost reduction and margin improvement as a positive for execution quality, even as it maintains a Hold rating rather than shifting to a more bullish stance.

🐻 Bearish Takeaways

TD Cowen cut its price target on American Well to $7 from $10, signaling a more cautious stance on the stock's valuation and implied upside despite recent operating progress.

The lower target and Hold rating underscore lingering concerns that, while cost actions are tracking well, the broader digital health backdrop and growth outlook justify a more restrained risk reward view for now.
