For purposes of this Agreement, Participant Background Intellectual Property” or means (a) all Intellectual Property ights owned or controlled by Participant existing as of the Effective Date of this Agreement; (b) any new Intellectual Property Rights designed, developed, owned in whole or in part, or licensed by Participant after the effective date of the Agreement independently of both (i) the Challenge and (ii) the nformation and Intellectual Property Rights of MSK; and (c) any updates, upgrades, corrections, modifications, improvements, and enhancements to any of the Background Intellectual Property described in clauses (a) and (b) above.

Publications Restrictions: Participant publi any output derived from use of Data (including Results). MSK . In instances where MSK Participant , MSK shall have the right to include any relevant MSK investigators as co-authors (or other equivalent form of recognition) with order of authorship being determined by the conventions of academic publications and tobe agreed upon by the Parties in writing. For clarity, these restrictions shall Participant’s commercialization activities disseminate Results and any other output derived from use of Data to broad, public audience in the context of scientific research.

As part of the iHub Challenge, each Participant will receive up to $10,000 in AWS Activate credits to support their cloud workloads. These credits are provided directly by AWS and will be applied to the Participant’s own AWS account, subject to AWS Activate Terms & Conditions.

Activation: Participants must complete the AWS Activate onboarding process to redeem their credits. MSK will provide referral information and instructions during Challenge onboarding.

Duration: AWS Activate credits are valid for up to 2 years from the date of activation. However, the actual duration may vary depending on whether the Participant has previously redeemed AWS Activate credits. Participants are responsible for reviewing the exact expiration date provided upon redemption.

Ownership and Management: Credits are issued directly to the Participant and managed through their own AWS account. MSK does not administer, monitor, or extend these credits. Any usage beyond the initial allocation is the sole responsibility of the Participant.

Permitted Use: Credits must be used in alignment with the iHub Challenge objectives and are subject to AWS Activate Terms & Conditions. Credits may not be used for unrelated commercial activity or transferred to other parties.

Support: MSK will offer initial setup guidance but is not responsible for AWS account issues, billing matters, or disputes related to credit eligibility or expiration.

For details, refer to AWS Activate Terms & Conditions and FAQs.

## DataHub Description and Terms of Use Overview of DataHub:

DataHub is a secure, cloud-based data access and analysis environment powered by Snowflake. It enables participants to perform exploratory data analysis, model development, and evaluation using de-identified MSK data sets. Core features include:

Role-based access controls and data governance tools

Scalable compute resources for processing large clinical datasets

Integrated support for commonly used data science languages and tools (e.g., SQL, Python)

Secure workspace isolation per participant

Pre-configured environments for data visualization and modeling

Logging and audit trails for security and compliance

## Management of Compute Credits:

Participant will be allocated an initial DataHub compute budget of $10,000. This allocation is intended to be sufficient for extensive SQL-based analysis and traditional machine learning workflows using CPU resources. However, it may not be adequate for sustained or large-scale GPU- intensive model training workloads, and such usage that are anticipated to exceed the initial compute budget should be proactively reviewed between Participant and MSK

If and when Participant uses 75% ($7,500) of this initial compute budget, MSK will notify Participant and the Parties will jointly review anticipated additional usage. Solely at MSK’s

discretion, and for the purpose of reasonably supporting Participant’s development objectives in the Challenge, MSK may allocate additional compute budget.

In addition, Participants may request additional compute capacity beyond the MSK-funded allocation by providing their own funds. Upon such request and subject to MSK approval, MSK will facilitate the purchase and provisioning of additional compute resources on the Participant’s behalf.

At no point will Participant be permitted to exceed the total compute budget allocated or purchased without MSK’s prior written approval.

## DataHub Import and Export:

All export requests, including models, outputs, or derived insights, are subject to MSK review and approval to ensure compliance with institutional information security, data privacy policies, and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Participants are strictly prohibited from exporting any model, algorithm, or derivative work reconstruct, infer, or reverse-engineer any data or patient-level information contained within the DataHub.

Export of trained models or derived outputs be permitted following MSK’s technical and compliance review, which may include an assessment of:

Model architecture and feature inputs

Potential for memorization or overfitting to individual-level data

Assurance that no identifiable or reconstructable information is included

Participants acknowledge and agree that MSK may deny export requests that pose a risk to patient privacy, institutional data integrity, or regulatory compliance.
