## Slide 16: The Value-Based Care Economic Model of Advanced Primary Care Drives Better Outcomes

### The Value-Based Care Economic Model of Advanced Primary Care Drives Better Outcomes

**Traditional Primary Care:**
**Fee-For-Service Economic Model**
(5-11% of Total Medical Spend)

*   **Limited Access**
    (2-12 week wait, 17 minutes with physician, overuse of ER/specialists*)
*   **Charge per Visit**
    (Primary care doesn't make money without charging patient)
*   **Disjointed Care Model**
    (No economic incentive to coordinate care)

    ⬇️
    *   Low Patient Experience
    *   Variable Quality
    *   No Savings

**Advanced Primary Care:**
**Value-Based Care Economic Model**
(7-15% of Total Medical Spend from Shared Savings)

*   **Better Access**
    (same day appointments, 20-60 minutes with physicians)
*   **Patient Affordability**
    ($0 or reduced patient out of pocket)
*   **Coordinated and Proactive Care**
    (Focus on mental health and a team-based approach)

    ⬇️
    *   **80+ NPS**
        (2X Patient Experience)
    *   **20%+ Improvement in Quality***
    *   **$1,500+ per Employee Savings****
        (15%+ Total Cost of Care Savings)
