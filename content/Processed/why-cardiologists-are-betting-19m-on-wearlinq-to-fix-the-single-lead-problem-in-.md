What You Should Know:

– Wearlinq has secured $14M in Series A funding (plus $5M in venture debt) to scale its eWave device, the first continuous 6-lead wireless ECG that offers hospital-grade diagnostics in a comfortable wearable led by AIX Ventures with participation from SpringTide and the Berkeley Catalyst Fund.

– The FDA-cleared device solves a critical gap in cardiac care by pairing directly with smartphones to deliver near real-time data, moving beyond the limitations of standard single-lead patches.

The Problem: You Can’t Catch What You Can’t See

Heart disease remains the leading cause of death in the U.S., claiming one in three lives. Yet, the tools available to cardiologists for remote monitoring have historically been a choice between comfort and accuracy.

Single-Lead Patches: Easy to wear but provide a limited “view” of the heart, often missing intermittent events or subtle electrical changes.

Wired Holter Monitors: provide better data but are cumbersome, leading to poor patient compliance and short monitoring windows.

“The status quo in cardiac monitoring still relies on single-lead patches and delayed insights,” notes Krish Ramadurai, Partner at AIX Ventures. This gap results in a dangerous cycle where “patients take devices off, doctors order repeat tests, and heart disease continues to claim millions more lives.”

The Solution: 6 Leads, No Wires

Wearlinq’s core innovation, the eWave, is the first continuous 6-lead ECG in a wireless format. In EKG diagnostics, “leads” are essentially different camera angles of the heart. Moving from a single-lead patch to a 6-lead device gives electrophysiologists a vastly more detailed 3D picture of the heart’s electrical activity. This allows for the detection of complex arrhythmias that simpler devices miss.

Crucially, Wearlinq has solved the usability puzzle alongside the engineering one. The device:

Pairs with personal phones: Unlike many medical devices that require a separate hub, eWave integrates with the patient’s existing smartphone.

Lasts 5+ days: Extended battery life allows for longer continuous monitoring windows.

Delivers Speed: It provides near real-time data transmission and clinician reports in under 48 hours.

“This is the kind of technology that can reshape how we detect arrhythmias and deliver personalized care to patients in the comfort of their own home,” said Albert Rogers, a Stanford electrophysiologist and Wearlinq co-founder.

The Road Ahead

With FDA 510(k) clearance already secured and thousands of patients currently utilizing the platform, Wearlinq is moving from the R&D phase to mass adoption.
