### TCV’s Data Infrastructure Investment Approach

- Later-stage focused: $50-200M equity checks
- Pre-IPO or growth equity context orientation
- Data infrastructure major focus area over last 5 years
	- Point solutions market very fragmented
	- Valuation environment challenging from late-stage perspective
- Active in modern data stack investments including dbt (before merger announcement)

### Modern Data Stack Evolution & Market Dynamics

- Cloud data warehouse landscape consolidation:
	- Databricks: $1B run-rate cloud data warehouse business, 60% growth
	- Snowflake: 25% top-line growth (accelerating slightly)
	- AWS, GCP, Azure as additional major players
- Apache Iceberg impact - prisoner’s dilemma situation:
	- Open table format reduces platform stickiness
	- Snowflake and Databricks embraced open standard despite reducing lock-in
- Market moving toward multi-warehouse/data lake paradigm:
	- dbt and Fivetran inherently neutral to underlying compute engines
	- Enterprises want interoperability across platforms
	- Avoid vendor lock-in scenarios
- Revenue distribution insights:
	- 75% of modern data stack revenue related to compute
	- 30-40% of compute spend specifically on data transformation
	- Fivetran positioning to capture compute revenue previously pushed to vendors
- Consolidation trend accelerating:
	- Data quality, observability, catalog tools prime acquisition targets
	- Similar to Informatica’s historical on-prem consolidation model

### dbt Open Source Model Analysis

- Market penetration metrics:
	- 80-90% adoption rate across modern data stack users
	- $150M ARR with 2,000 paid enterprise customers
	- 30,000 total enterprises using platform (low paid conversion rate)
- Open source effectiveness debate:
	- Massive user base scale achieved
	- Limited community contribution model (contributors mostly dbt employees)
	- Lacks leveraged development model of other developer platforms
- Monetization challenges:
	- Seat-based vs consumption-based pricing debate
	- Tech-savvy organizations prefer free self-hosted version
	- Recent licensing model changes to drive cloud adoption
- Technical platform evolution:
	- Complete replatform through SDF Labs acquisition
	- Legacy tech debt from data engineer vs developer build approach
	- New “Fusion” engine: faster performance, cost savings over free version
	- Value proposition: “cheaper than free” due to query optimization

### Healthcare Data Infrastructure Opportunity

- Market leapfrogging potential:
	- Healthcare adopting modern data stack later but skipping intermediate steps
	- Big health systems and pharma getting first Databricks deployments recently
	- Recognition of consolidation trends happening earlier in adoption cycle
- Tuva positioning leveraging industry trends:
	- Building comprehensive healthcare data transformation platform
	- Addressing fragmented connector landscape (beyond Fivetran to Redox, others)
	- Offering consolidated analytics tools menu with 50% cost savings
- Market sizing context:
	- ETL annual category revenue: $2-3B
	- Transformation revenue: $500M-$1B
	- Compute revenue: $8-10B
	- Informatica legacy transformation ~$2B (includes other products)
