## 0. Framing
In order to succeed, a company must grow different Verticals -- People, Product, Sales, and Value Delivery -- proportionally. If e.g. Sales grows disproportionately, the company can be building a house of cards; if e.g. People grows disproportionately, the company can waste capital; and so forth.

The below table shows the different Verticals within the company. For each Vertical, companies go through different Phases, i.e. Seed, Early, Growth phases. And, for each Vertical x Phase combination, there is often a 'key question' that must be affirmatively answered. For example, at the Seed Phase, the key question for Sales is whether the founders can sell the same thing a few times in a row; at the Early Phase its whether a Sales team can do so; and at the Growth stage its whether a Sales team can sell predictably (i.e. a competent Salesperson should be able to sell $5M ARR) and with good CAC.

The Most Important Problem (MIP) is typically the most laggard Vertical; e.g. if People, Product, and Value Delivery are all in the 'Early' Phase, but Sales is in the 'Seed' Phase, then that's usually where there should be immense focus. It is a mistake is to divide attention across all areas equally, or worse, spend extra attention on the area that's going well!

Exceptions:
* Some Verticals x Phase combinations may be more difficult to solve, so that Vertical needs a large amount of focus even before said Stage is reached.
* Large technology or market shifts may cause Verticals to quickly transition between different Phases, so anticipating those shifts is important.

Each Vertical x Phase combination has high level metrics (seen here) and deeper-dive metrics.

## Slide 3: SmarterDx is in the Early Phase

SmarterDx is in the Early Phase.
We feel confident about having 'proven' Product, Sales, and Customer Value hypotheses at the Seed level. However, People, specifically hiring and talent retention, and especially for engineering, remains an area of focus.

For the Verticals at the Early Phase, we feel proportionally better about Sales and Product.
*   Sales: we remain on track for $6-8M CARR by EOY 2023; early indicators are this will continue to scale.
*   Product: remains very differentiated relative to market with a NPS of 100 (see KLAS preview)
*   People: remains a challenge as there are >10 roles that we are in need of filling.
*   Value Delivery: still founder-led rather than process-driven.

As we look ahead to the Growth Phase, scalability of Product and Value Delivery will largely depend on our ability to scale data science (including product analytics). Thus, People is our Most Important Problem for Q3; Value Delivery for Q4; then data science within Product will likely be the Most Important Problem as we transition into Q1.

In future communications, we will show the above table with the high level metrics as an overall "health dashboard" for the company.

## Slide 4: 1. Financials

Reporting in this area has been limited historically; however, we have just hired Henry Su (https://www.linkedin.com/in/henrysu1/) who was the Head of Finance at Embark Trucks (starting Aug 7). This is reflected as the Q3 focus area below.

We have not yet significantly increased burn relative to projections (see below; note that one-time expenses from the round have not been accrued to June 2023. We project an increase in burn in August - October by 200K per month until revenue is recognized from anticipated deployments in Q3 + Q4 (UHS, Montefiore, Houston Methodist).

**Key metrics**
*   Runway: 4.5 years
*   Cash balance as of end of June 2023: $16.02M
*   (+) AR of $786K, (-) Liabilities of $155K = $16.65M

**Q3 focus area**
*   **{Action}**: **{Expected Outcome}**
*   Henry (Head of Finance, new hire): improved financial reporting and scenario planning

## Slide 5: 2. Can the product be sold by Sales? (Sales)

★ Not yet proven, but on track.
This was Q1 + Q2's MIP.

Since then, several new developments made us feel more confident in this Vertical:
*   Continued pipeline growth (see below)
*   Our new CCO (Wayne Grodsky) started and independently added to the Sales pipeline
*   Sales + Product successfully represented us at a conference without Mike
*   Sales has taken customers from 'Prospect' to 'Active' stage without Mike's involvement (i.e. repeated messaging is working)
*   Increased contract value: $90K MRR for Houston Methodist, 15% contingency for UHS (12.5% if expanded system-wide), and 15 - 20% for several other contracts under negotiation.

We will continue to expand the sales team, with Janita Adams starting as a new Sales RVP, as well as a branding and marketing update. With respect to marketing, positioning ourselves as AI experts will address one of the four major reasons customers do not move forward. By Q4, we expect to have early indicators as to whether Janita is effective, and if three separate people are adding to the Sales pipeline in early Q1 then we will have 'proven' this Vertical at the Early stage.

**Key metrics**
*   Wayne has come in and effectively added to the Sales pipeline
*   CARR is on target for $6-8M by the end of 2023
*   New contracts have increased value relative to initial contracts

**Q3 focus area**
*   Janita Adams (new hire): will cover SE Sales
*   Brendan White (new hire): formalize Sales Ops + improved metrics
*   Looking for: Branding agency, Dir of Marketing, MW + South Sales late Q3/Q4

**Sum of ACV: 37M - Pipeline Stages**

Of this pipeline, we expect all $3M in the contracting stage to close and 'Go Live' in Q3, and an additional $2-4M in earlier stages to close in Q3 + Q4, bringing us to $6-8M in CARR and about $6M in annual run rate.

| Stage                 | ACV (M) | Percentage |
| :-------------------- | :------ | :--------- |
| Prospect              | 8.1M    | 21.61%     |
| Qualification         | 11M     | 29.52%     |
| Active                | 4.2M    | 11.22%     |
| Assessment            | 9M      | 24.05%     |
| Finalist              | 1.9M    | 5%         |
| Agreement Delivered   | 3.1M    | 8.33%      |
| **Total**             | **37M** | **100%**   |

**Stages (Definitions)**
1.  **Prospect** - Initial sales meeting scheduled & completed
2.  **Qualified** - "Real" interest; scheduled follow-ups
3.  **Active** - Looping in parties needed for execution
4a. **Assessment** - planning, production, results
4b. **Best of Few/Finalist / Vendor of Choice**
5.  **Agreement Delivered**
6.  **Contracting** - redlines received
7.  **Executable** - signed by SmarterDx
8.  **Closed / Won** - signed by client
0.  **Closed / Lost** - Competitor, No decision, Timing

The Assessment stage helps with conversion but extends our sales cycle. But, of note, it freezes out other vendors that may be in conversation. Thus, at this point, we are aiming to reduce assessments a bit (e.g. in 90% rather than 100% of customers; and only if the hospital is of a certain size) but are not in a hurry to remove it altogether.

**Reasons customers say no (Supplied for reference)**
*   Not part of broader org strategy, so not a priority
*   Recent purchase of another solution
*   No bandwidth to add new processes
*   Unable to get to the right person

## Slide 6: 3. Is the value realized by a set of customers? (Value Delivery)

★★ Needs significant attention.

Product and Value Delivery are intrinsically linked for us (e.g. better data science allows for better recommendations at scale; better product analytics allows for better user monitoring at scale), so some metrics and points of discussion here also apply to Product and vice versa.

Our customers consistently achieve more than $2M in net new revenue per 10,000 eligible discharges and assessments support this. Furthermore, time-to-value for customers is on the order of days.

**Key metrics**
*   Customer revenue > $2M per 10,000 discharges

**Customer Revenue Over Time (May 2022 - May 2023) - Data Points from Chart**

| Month (DISCH_DTM) | Revenue per 10,000 discharges |

However, unlike Sales, Mike, Josh, and Nathan are still closely involved at every step of Value Delivery (Assessment and Go-Live). This is an issue because we expect to complete, at a minimum, 14 Assessments and 5 Go-Lives in the next two quarters! We have a complex Assessment stage which involves an orchestration of several functions within the company (Sales, Ops, IT, Data Science, Clinical Ops, Customer Success).

**Key metrics**
*   Time in assessment
*   Time in go-live
*   Engineering time per assessment/go-live - 26+ hours
*   CAC - not yet measured

**Q3 focus area**
*   Brendan White (new hire, Growth Ops): Improved processes + metrics / SLA for each stage
*   Charlie Peters (new hire, FSE): Internal tooling for ETL process
*   Hiring: Implementation PM, IT integration

There are two major components to improving this area:
*   One is just improved operations, which includes more robust handoff processes, monitoring, and further help with non-technical steps.
*   The other is more challenging: currently, engineering is responsible for much of the initial ETL, but data science / clinical ops understands the data. Thus, the data feed takes a long time to complete because it's difficult for engineers to intuit the appropriate transforms, and then they need to be fixed by data science / clinical ops. We are starting on an internal ETL application to abstract the build.

Our goal is to significantly improve Assessment and Go-Live in Q3; as Ops improves, we anticipate there is an opportunity to decrease Time in assessment by 3+ weeks (and we will track this number and sub-stages more closely).

Looking ahead, by later Q4 / early Q1, Customer Success for implemented hospitals is likely to be the focus. The rate-limiting step for Customer Success for implemented hospitals are:
*   Clinical Ops / COGS (which is related to progress on data science)
*   Inter-rater reliability (which requires us to have clinical experts, assisted by Product Analytics)

## Slide 7: 4. Does the product provide higher value relative to the market? (Product)

★ Not yet proven, but on track. However, we anticipate this will rise in importance (especially within Data Science) as we move from Early to Growth stage.

See KLAS report (attached).

We have achieved strong results behind several concurrent vendors (3M 360, Nuance, and CDR2 by Claro). Relative to Cloudmed, we have many more CDI findings, but are weaker than them on Procedure-related Coding findings.

**Key metrics**
*   Findings relative to Accuity, Faircode (2.5 - 3X)
*   Findings relative to Cloudmed
*   Churn - 0%

**Q3 focus area**
*   Add Procedure Codes
*   Proof of Concept Query Composer
*   Flesh out Denials value

At a strategic level, our goals for product are to increase value while:
*   Expanding our data footprint
*   Expanding our user footprint (time per user or different users) *without* expanding our buyer footprint (i.e. deeper integration without increasing the size of the buyer 'committee')

**Denials Workflow and Reasons:**

| Stage             | Data/Action                               |
| :---------------- | :---------------------------------------- |
| Denials prevention | More revenue                              |
| Auto appeal       | Prebill                                   |
| Clinical Denials  | Data: adds 837/835 data streams           |

**Denials is a promising space for several reasons:**
1.  We have a significant data advantage (i.e. we can incorporate clinical data to invalidate denials) vs. existing market players
2.  A more complete Prebill product includes Denials prevention; whereas a more complete Denials product *also* includes Denials prevention (thus, the products are synergistic)
3.  The same overall buyer (VP Finance, CFO)
4.  Appeals to additional influencers (Compliance)
5.  Payments data will help us further validate net revenue
6.  Denials will likely increase as auto-documentation increases

**Product Completeness and New Product:**

| :----------------- | :------------------------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------- |
| Product completeness | Procedure codes                             |                                                 |
|                    | Additional Cloudmed findings                |                                                 |
|                    | Query Composer                              | No bandwidth to add new processes               |
|                    | Concurrent CDI?                             | Data: adds concurrent data streams              |
| New product        | Denials                                     | Not part of a broader strategy                  |

**Query Composer:** In addition to denials, one pain point for Sales is that users are currently 'too busy'. The Query Composer is a feature that will make our product more complete, and will start to allow us to move upstream to get concurrent data as well.

## Slide 8: 5. Is there a strong hiring and retention process for the company? (People)

★ MIP

Any and all help here will be greatly appreciated (see attached most urgent roles and respective JDs).

At this point, most of our challenges are gated by number of people rather than prioritization or customer data.

We have had two engineers (out of a 5.5 person team) leave the company; one was very strong.

Sourcing relative to the number of open positions remains challenging. Henry will start helping here, and we have interviewed several highly-recommended recruiters.

**Key metrics**
*   Strong interviewer inter-rater reliability
*   Strong sourcing relative to hiring needs
*   Level of talent within the company

**Q3 focus area**
*   Hire a recruiter
*   Better validation of
*   Flesh out Denials value

**Key roles - Q3 and early Q4**

**Most urgent roles:**
*   FS / Data Eng
*   Recruiter
*   Integration PM
