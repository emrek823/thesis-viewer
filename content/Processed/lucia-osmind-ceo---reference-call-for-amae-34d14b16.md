Lucia (CEO @ Osmind)

Stas was an advisor to Osmind for 8 months in 2020

Great sounding board as we were getting the idea off the ground. Really helpful to have early-stage investor to think through initial strategy

Very passionate about mental health

CZI is a very cushy gig (pay a lot + big impact). You really have to be passionate about something to leave there

Sonia (ETK note: Lucia was much more positive on Sonia

Sonia and I got introduced throug another friend of mine in business school

Very impressive program at the design school

Sonia gave Osmind a lot of user feedback and help with product early on

Brother w/ SMI - “whatever it takes in mental health”

Rose up very quickly at brightline but didn’t like that they were focusing on lwoer acuity

Toyed with starting SMI business before meeting with Stas, more focused on adolescent care and care nav for SMI

She “broke up” with that co-founder because the guy didn’t want to charge at it like she did

Scott (CMO)

I know of Scott, not personally, but it’s a big deal that they got someone from UCLA.

Lots of money funneled through Grand Challenge for depression research

Best researchers and clinicians work there

Are Sonia and Stas ready to be founders? Based on your experience as investor turned founder?

It was a culture shock for me honestly. Stas will feel that as well. But he’s lucky to have SOnia. SHe’s been through that. She was early at Brightline
