### Current Business Update

- Previously focused on claims denials solution
- Pivoted after meeting with hospital C-suite:
	- ASC wouldn’t generate sufficient revenue
	- Target hospital lacked in-house billing department
	- Full C-suite (CEO, CIO, COO) expressed strong interest in broader AI implementation
- Current hospital use limited to “outer operational layer”:
	- AI medical scribes
	- Patient intake
	- High-level RCM
	- Similar to existing market solutions

### New Strategic Direction

- Secured contract for embedded operational discovery
- Hospital identified key opportunity areas in “deeper operational stuff”:
	- Pharmacy operation workflows
	- Nursing workforce workflows
	- Focus on inpatient and outpatient operations
- Starts next Monday with immediate deployment
- Long-term vision: Build horizontal healthcare automation platform
	- Create bespoke products within each workflow
	- Initial focus on pharmacy operations (revenue driver)
	- Target inefficiencies in medication history and order verification
	- Goal: Improve discharge times and reduce length of stay

### Team & Structure

- Partnered with college friend with strong product background:
	- Led product at Lyft (AI/ML tools, healthcare initiatives)
	- Headed Revolut’s insurance business
- Current team structure:
	- Two co-founders focused on product discovery
	- Planning to hire founding engineer post-engagement
	- Deliberately delayed technical hire to focus on discovery phase

### Business Development Strategy

- Secured contract within 2 months using contingency payment model
	- 25% of realized savings (higher than industry standard 10-12%)
- Planning fundraise after initial engagement
	- Will use learnings to refine product vision
	- Timing aligns with technical hiring needs

### Notable Success Factors

- Embedded approach mirrors successful companies (e.g., Redesign)
- Hospital partnership provides direct workflow insights
- Focus on discovering inefficiencies before building solution
- Strategic decision to delay fundraising to focus on customer discovery
