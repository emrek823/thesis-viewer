# DocSend Presentation: AMAE Health

## Slide 1: AMAE Health

AMAE Health
High-touch value-based integrated care provider for patients with SMI

## Slide 2: Existing treatment options are:

### 14 Million
People in the US struggle with a serious mental illness (SMI)*

**Existing treatment options are:**

*   **Expensive**
    *   >$300B spent on SMI in the US alone yearly
    *   6.3x higher spend per patient than compared to non-SMI population, as >50% of patients have a comorbidity
*   **Ineffective**
    *   SMI is the 2nd leading cause of 30-day readmissions in hospitals for Medicaid patients
*   **Fragmented**
    *   1 in 5 people with a SMI will also develop a substance use disorder - only 7% with dual diagnoses receive treatment for both

### 47%
In 2018, half of all adults with SMI did not receive psychiatric treatment

\*Serious mental illness is defined as someone over the age of 18 who has a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder that causes serious functional impairment that substantially interferes with or limits one or more major life activities. This includes a diagnosis of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depressive disorder (MDD).

## Slide 3: Mental health is treated separately from physical health

...is the brain not part of the body?

*   Current treatments & the dominant mental health care model do not address SDoH challenges
*   Mental health is almost always carved out of risk-bearing contracts
*   Splitting mental health from physical health leads to uncoordinated and fragmented care plans

**This makes it challenging to deliver Personalized Care**
Current models cannot effectively account for individual needs, particularly for patients with serious mental illness
Ultimately this prevents comprehensive data tracking and insights, integration and efficiency for patient care

We know the best outcomes are only possible when mental and physical health are integrated

## Slide 4: SMI patients have significantly higher prevalence of costly physical chronic conditions

| Condition          | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| :----------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Diabetes**       | • ~2x higher prevalence of diabetes in SMI patients than the general population (9% across the general U.S. population)                                                                                                         |
| **Life Expectancy** | • 2–3 times higher average mortality for SMI patients compared to the general population, reflecting a 10–20 year reduction in life expectancy                                                                                   |
| **Hypertension**   | • Hypertension is 33% more prevalent in bipolar patients <br> • 48% of MDD patients have hypertension compared to 30% of the general population, an increase of 60%                                                              |
| **Cardiovascular issues** | • 1.5–3x higher risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in SMI patients when compared with the general population                                                                                                  |

## Slide 5: There is great need for a new SMI care model

Health equity and behavioral health are top priorities for payors

*   **Evernorth (Cigna Corporation's health services business) shows when people with a BH condition receive treatment, costs decrease:**
    *   First-of-its-kind analysis proves medical and pharmacy costs can decrease by more than $3,000 per person over two years when people receive outpatient behavioral health care
*   **According to the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI), 58% of health systems listed equity as a top priority in 2021**
    *   This is a significant jump from 25% two years ago
*   **Managed Medicaid and Medicare Advantage payors**
    *   are demanding better ways to align incentives and share risk from their providers
*   **Pressure from state Medicaid agencies**
    *   to carve in BH to an "integrated" framework, requiring MCO's to take on difficult to treat and expensive SMI patients
*   **Managed Medicaid plans will need a SMI Solution**
    *   Our solution helps our Medicaid customers grow their member base and revenue, alongside reducing their MLR

## Slide 6: Redirecting spend toward effective SMI treatment

### 14 Million
People with SMI

| Condition                       | Average Spend |
| :------------------------------ | :------------ |
| Patients with schizophrenia     | $45K          |
| Patients with bipolar disorder  | $23K          |
| Patients with major depressive disorder | $15K          |

### $350 Billion
Total Addressable Market

## Slide 7: Amae Health is a value-based integrated care provider that treats behavioral health first

By focusing our treatment on a patient's primary diagnosis, their SMI, we can vastly improve their outcomes and also help treat their physical health comorbidities

1.  **Flipping the treatment model to treat SMI as the primary condition**
    *   Just like a nephrologist is the lead clinician for a patient with chronic kidney disease, a psychiatrist should be the lead clinician for a patient with SMI
2.  **Taking responsibility for treatment costs for patients with the highest needs**
    *   The primary driver of these patients' health outcomes and healthcare costs is their SMI. Physical health conditions are comorbidities that cannot be properly managed until the underlying SMI is treated
3.  **Aligning incentives and delivering innovative clinical approaches for improved outcomes**
    *   Providing high resource treatments that FFS doesn't properly support:
        *   Long-acting injectables, Clozapine, IV Ketamine, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)
    *   Addressing SMI specific SDoH including:
        *   Substance abuse treatment, housing, employment, nutrition, sleep, and finding purpose and meaning

## Slide 8: A hybrid solution that meets our patients where they are

**Hybrid Care:** Flexibility in engaging the patient how and when it makes the most sense

### Amae Care Center

*   A combined community center and outpatient clinical facility built / leased by Amae that provides education, mentorship, and socialization in tandem with a healthcare center for clinical work
*   Option for temporary housing and respite care onsite as an emergency stopgap to build trust and prevent unnecessary hospitalizations

### Amae Digital Patient Platform

*   A single platform and EHR that:
    *   Integrates remote monitoring including assessments and adherence tracking
    *   Syncs data from digital health devices
    *   Presents meaningful data summary to clinicians and providers
    *   Enables personalized treatment planning and task management
    *   Video + asynchronous treatment

## Slide 9: First, we take a high-touch approach to initial engagement

We intervene at a critical behavior change point and build trust through dedicated support for a patient's immediate needs

*   **Engage patient at the ED**
    *   Pre-discharge, an onsite Amae Engager (LCSW) meets with the patient at the ED and onboards them into our community
*   **Onboard and set up a care plan**
    *   We create an account for the patient, set up their care dashboard, receive consents and intake medical records to pair with claims data
*   **Care coordinator matching**
    *   Patient is matched with a care coordinator based on preferences, presenting symptoms, cultural competency, and medical history
*   **Housing facilitation**
    *   If needed, a living arrangement is provided based on their existing status and living conditions (e.g. home-attendant for suicidal patient living alone)
*   **Telepsychiatry evaluation**
    *   When a psychiatrist is not available during a patient's hospitalization, we provide a telepsychiatry evaluation to expedite discharge

## Slide 10: Next, we provide delivery of holistic care

With a psychiatry-led model, we establish personalized treatment plans for patients' behavioral health, physical health and additional SDoH needs to vastly improve outcomes compared to existing solutions

**Psychiatrist**
**Care Coordinator**

### Clinical

*   **NP / GP**
    *   Psychiatrist and the nurse practitioner / general physician work together to evaluate and establish a personalized medication and treatment plan including SUD treatment, comorbidity treatments, and medication side effect monitoring
*   **Medication Management**
*   **Psychologist**

### Social Determinants of Health

*   **Support System**
*   **Housing**
*   **Community + Holistic Health**
    *   Care coordinator (LCSW) acts as our patients' health “quarterback" and helps address critical social determinants of health including but not limited to: housing, nutrition, sleep, exercise, mindfulness, support system engagement, community integration

## Slide 11: Over the long term, our patients advance from acute illness to prosperity planning

### Amae Prosperity Pact

*   **Amae Peer Mentor**
*   **Prosperity Pact**

*   Amae Patient is assigned an Amae Peer Mentor – an individual with SMI experience whom the patient can relate to and build trust with based on their condition
*   Peer mentor supports patient in completing their Amae Prosperity Pact – a set of measurable aims to re-establish meaning and purpose in a patient's life
*   Amae Patient will also be responsible for engaging in local community service efforts and volunteering in order to feel that they are contributing to their community and helping others

## Slide 12: Existing treatment modalities and clinical research have proven this model works

We we aim to leverage key learnings to tackle this systemic issue

*   **EDSM**
    *   Zuckerberg SF General
    *   Emergency Department
    *   Social Medicine Team
*   **CCBHC** (Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinic)
    *   Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics
*   **ACT** (Assertive Community Treatment)
    *   Assertive Community Treatment Programs
*   **US Department of VA**
    *   United States Department of Veteran Affairs

**Sources:** JAMA, Case, CCBHC

## Slide 13: We address core pain points across patients, providers and payors

Providing personalized and high-touch treatment that improves patient outcomes while lowering the total spend

### Patients

*   Provide a holistic treatment approach that directly addresses both the patient's SMI needs and their physical health needs
*   Deliver highly effective medications that are complex to administer & often not reimbursable in a FFS world
*   Focus on helping patients lead overall healthier and more meaningful lives

### Providers

*   Increase capacity for ED beds by alleviating them of SMI patients that are a loss driver as traditional billing does not cover the cost of care
*   Reduce hospital readmissions for these challenging patients, as SMI is the 2nd leading cause of 30-day readmissions for Medicaid patients
*   Alleviate physician burnout with this difficult to manage population by discharging patients faster

### Payors

*   Increase payors' membership via Medicaid assignment & Medicare Advantage open enrollment
*   Lower MLR by treating the SMI as the primary disease which then improves physical health comorbidities
*   Take on the patients that other risk providers carve out and provide a health equity solution

## Slide 14: Go-to-Market Strategy: Start Regionally

1.  **Secure Commercial Contract**
    *   VBC with a payor to receive capitation rate to treat frequent healthcare utilizing SMI patients
2.  **Partner with Local Health Systems**
    *   Work with local health systems as our core patient acquisition & onboarding site; eventually health systems will also be customers
3.  **Build and Implement Technology Product**
    *   Build our technology platform to implement Amae Patient Treatment Model with robust data capture across integrated care plans
4.  **Execute and Scale our Solution**
    *   Provide value to our initial payor partner, grow to cover more lives and expand to additional regions

## Slide 19: Appendix

## Slide 20: Complexity of multi-factorial impacts on SMI outcomes

**Chart Title:** Complexity of multi-factorial impacts on SMI outcomes

**Axes:**
*   Y-axis: Influenceability (fixed to flexible)
*   X-axis: Measurability (signal:noise) (stabile to labile)

**Nodes (factors impacting SMI outcomes):**
*   diet & exercise
*   housing
*   support networks
*   sleep
*   actigraphy
*   energy
*   employment
*   cognition
*   neuroimaging
*   distress
*   education
*   hedonic tone
*   temperament
*   'omics
*   income
*   neuroendocrinology
*   social environment
*   childhood history
*   genetics

*(The chart shows a complex network of interconnected nodes representing these factors, with lines indicating relationships and impacts. "Energy," "distress," and "hedonic tone" appear as central, highly connected nodes.)*

## Slide 21: Measurement-based methodologies to understand complex human behavior are increasingly more available

### The ways to measure complex human behavior are exploding

*   There is a huge catalog of well validated assessments to measure relevant aspects of human behavior and characteristics
*   Genetics is starting to develop a deep catalog of variants correlated with complex human characteristics and will continue to grow to include phenotypes related to treatment response
*   Digital health technology and wearables acquire a massive amount of data related to sleep, physical activity, and social behavior
*   Artificial Intelligence aims to use the massive quantity of data to shift prediction from populations to individuals

### Increasing role for measurement-based care in mental health treatment

*   **Initial treatment planning:** Population level evidence will be used to classify individuals based on genetics, biomarkers, demographics and baseline assessments to predict and refine an initial treatment plan
*   **Adjunct treatment monitoring:** Ongoing 'real-time' measurements can be used to inform adjustments to treatment
*   **Wellness-monitoring:** Continuous post-treatment measurement-based monitoring (activity, social interactions, sleep, biomarkers) can identify early evidence of symptom worsening and enable early interventions

**Research provided by Dr. Scott Fears, CMO Amae Health**

## Slide 22: Future of leveraging measurement and data to enable precision medicine

### Conventional vs. Alternative Approach

*   Conventional psychiatric approach assigns a one-size-fits-all plan based predominantly on a diagnostic category
*   An alternative approach is to use measurement-based methods to:
    *   Define symptom targets
    *   Predict optimal treatment plan
    *   Monitor and adjust treatment course
    *   Maintain wellness

### Enabling focused and tailored treatment

*   Leverage denser data acquisition to identify patients as high risk for suicidality
*   Use our digital platform to increase communication bandwidth
*   Develop personalized treatment plans with specific targets (e.g. sleep quality and stress) to lower baseline risk
*   Build a research program to investigate basic science of suicide e.g. integrate clinical research with basic science
*   'Omics-approach to identify biomarkers of risk and resilience

**Research provided by Dr. Scott Fears, CMO Amae Health**

## Slide 23: Provider hiring strategy: Addressing the supply and demand issue

Amae Health's clinical model will be advantageous in the recruitment and retention of clinical staff

*   **We allow our providers to make a real impact on low-income patients lives**
    *   Enables them to have meaningful time and engagement with patients, while incentivizing them to have patients' outcomes top of mind
*   **Recruit passionate clinicians and LCSW's from FQHC's, City hospitals, Department of Public Health**
    *   Provide mission-driven clinicians and providers a place where they can take care of the severely ill and impoverished populations, and fulfilling their clinical goals and dreams
