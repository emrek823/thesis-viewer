# CuraFi Executive Summary

## Problem
Specialty drugs are expensive medications that treat complex diseases ranging from cancer to rare diseases. These drugs are typically taken periodically, and some can only be administered by nurses or doctors (“physician-administered drugs" or PAD). Patients cannot simply “swallow a pill” in most cases.

Today's fragmented care delivery process and risk of holding onto expensive drug assets have mis-incentivized providers to mark up these drugs and accompanying services (the drugs are bought as needed in a “buy and bill” process). This amounts to a 250-1000% markup on top of the price of the drug.

This is an unsustainable cashflow problem for insurance, employers, and patients, who in addition experience increasing delays in care. Specialty drugs are the leading cause of ballooning healthcare expenses; accounting for ~40% of total costs ($192B) while only constituting 2% of all prescriptions. The problem is growing double digit year over year and most drugs coming to market are classified as specialty drugs.

## Our Solution
CuraFi is developing a risk-pool carveout to manage specific episodes of care. Initially we are focusing on FDA-approved biologics for autoimmune diseases (i.e. Rheumatoid Arthritis, Psoriasis, Inflammatory Bowel Disease). We are also exploring using this model for Multiple Sclerosis, Asthma, Chronic Migraine, Cancer (including Car T), and cell/gene therapy.

CuraFi's solution vertically integrates a network of provider partners (contracted), virtual care management (employed), and an aligned specialty pharmacy to support purchasing these products at favorable rates and providing services in the most efficient care settings.

In a practical example, we will purchase and hold title to the drugs ourselves (such as a Remicade biologic instead of originator drug), and our care management team will adjudicate whether care can be delivered at home or at a partner infusion center, and keep steady communication between patient, providers, and insurers.

By developing a vertically integrated solution around a specific subset of PADs, CuraFi delivers high quality care more quickly, eliminate prior auth/paperwork gatekeeping, and capture margin by prescribing biosimilars vs. name brand drugs, taking a data-driven approach to adjudicating whether PADs should be administered at home vs. infusion center, optimizing step therapy, and buying drugs in bulk.

## Revenue Model
The risk-pool carveout is designed to immediately save a percentage margin for our customers – insurers/risk-bearing orgs that are delegating a risk subset to CuraFi. Within the alocated budget, which is paid in a subscription “per member per month” depending on existing population, CuraFi takes on the care management process as defined previously.

CuraFi keeps the cost savings and partially shares these savings with provider partners to keep them incentivized (legally through our IPA structure).

## Traction
Since the incorporation of the company in March 2022, we have conducted over a dozen interviews with large health plans, regional health plans, self-insured employers and their administrators, and Medicare/Medicaid managed care orgs. All have agreed that specialty pharmacy is a “high priority problem” and specifically in the area of “buy and bill" and physician-administered drugs. We are in very early discussions with one organization to scope out the impact of the problem on their business, so we can iterate on our solution.

One of our competitive advantages is leveraging existing relationships with provider networks and knowing which geographic areas are most in need of this solution.
