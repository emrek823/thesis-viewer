# Integral Product & Data Modality Roadmap

The Future - Healthcare Goes Agentic

In a world where healthcare becomes agentic, every enterprise leveraging healthcare data will depend on a compliant infrastructure. Whether it is a Fortune 2000 company, an AI doctor diagnosing patients in real time, or a new period-tracking app safely monetizing sensitive data, all data will flow through Integral’s infrastructure.

Today

Integral is building the infrastructure that allows data to move safely, learn continuously, and act intelligently. By powering the core layers of compliance, data movement, enrichment, and decisioning, Integral is positioned to become the centralized, compliant infrastructure layer for any organization seeking to unlock healthcare data.

## Phase 1: HIPAA Privacy Agent (Launched GA)

Integral’s first focus is automating the dynamic statistical analysis required to accurately assess structured and unstructured data accurately from a risk perspective in a way that allows for high throughput and quality. Our platform ingests raw HIPAA regulated data, scans it for patient and consumer risk in accordance with HIPAA’s de-identification standards, and transforms it into compliant, production-ready output.

Core Features

Automated k-map, k-anonymity, and hybrid statistical models ready for production use on structured data.

Natural-language and pattern-based entity recognition that identifies PHI in clinical notes, PDFs, and transcripts.

Policy-driven remediation that applies generalization, suppression, tokenization, or redaction based on configurable risk thresholds.

OCR and layout-aware document processing that preserves document integrity while removing identifiers.

Automated HIPAA Expert Determination reports generated directly from the same engine that performed the analysis.

Compliant data transformations automatically executed and delivered directly to end destinations.

Result: Customers can transform raw, non-compliant datasets into certified, production-ready copies in hours instead of weeks.

Strategic Outcome: Enterprises operate at the speed of software rather than manual consulting. This accelerates ROI from data investments and enables faster analysis, model training, and deployment with full compliance confidence.

## Phase 2: Integral Connect Agent Part 1 (Launched Beta, GA In Progress)

Once compliance automation is established, Integral evolves from one-time certification to continuous, real-time compliant delivery. Agents keep certified datasets synchronized between data sources and data delivery destinations so that healthcare data remains current and compliant on a daily, monthly, or quarterly cadence.

Core Features

End-to-end pipeline for ingestion from source, and delivery to a destination in a single configuration.

Common data model loaded into internal on-prem foundational model deployments for streamlining recommendation of historical factors

Incremental data monitoring that detects new values or schema changes and automatically triggers re-certification.

Version control for every dataset and certification report to ensure full auditability.

Integrated delivery to Snowflake, Databricks, and other enterprise analytics environments.

Result: Compliant datasets are continuously refreshed and delivered, giving customers access to the most up-to-date healthcare data without re-certification delays.

Strategic Outcome: In healthcare, precision drives outcomes. Continuous compliant delivery ensures that models, analytics, and decisions operate on the most accurate data available. This improves diagnoses, targeting, and treatment results while maximizing data velocity and trust.

## Phase 3: Integral Connect Agent P2 (Not Launched, Partially Started)

With continuous delivery in place, Integral begins automatically improving dataset quality.
The platform identifies weaknesses in data and enriches them to improve completeness, coverage, and reliability.

Core Features

Automated detection of sparse, inconsistent, or biased data fields.

Historical scoring of dataset quality across refreshes and deliveries.

Self-serve configuration to enable users to connect various data lakes on their own

Configurable enrichment pipelines that merge approved datasets while retaining certification integrity.

Result: Customers receive real-time, compliant data that is cleaner, more complete, and optimized for analytics, AI training, and decision-making.

Strategic Outcome: Nearly 80 percent of healthcare data is unstructured and error-prone. As Integral processes more datasets, it learns corrective patterns and applies them automatically. This strengthens downstream accuracy, reduces data loss, and increases the long-term ROI of every compliant dataset.

## Phase 4: Integral Intelligence Agent (Not Launched, Partially Started, Big Future Bet)

Integral’s infrastructure evolves from static pipelines to agentic systems that learn from usage, predict risk, and autonomously optimize data flow and quality. At this stage, customers will use Integral not only for compliant delivery but also for analytics, collaboration, and decision-making directly within the platform.

Core Features

Continuous monitoring agents that detect compliance drift and trigger self-improving data transformations.

Predictive modeling that anticipates emerging data risk and quality degradation.

Natural-language interface that allows users to query, visualize, and analyze datasets directly through charts, summaries, and reports.

Example Use Case: A pharma company such as AbbVie can use Integral to deliver compliant datasets to internal and external environments while maintaining separation for compliance. Integral’s agentic interface then allows both teams to collaborate securely using natural-language queries rather than static dashboards.

Result: Integral consolidates data movement, analysis, and collaboration into one secure environment, improving efficiency and enabling real-time insight sharing across organizations.

Strategic Outcome: This evolution allows Integral to own both compliant data processing and the transactions and insights generated from that data. It extends Integral’s reach into the core domains of modern data infrastructure and analytics.

Data Modality Roadmap

Integral’s modality coverage expands the total addressable surface of healthcare data it can automate, establishing it as the foundation for all regulated data types. As Integral’s agents train on data modalities, their compliance, delivery, enrichment, and intelligence layers continuously improve in speed, quality, and coverage.

Result: Integral’s growing modality coverage enables the healthcare ecosystem to safely activate a wider range of structured and unstructured data through a single compliant infrastructure.
