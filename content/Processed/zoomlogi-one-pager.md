ZoomLogi
ZoomLogi tackles a major healthcare challenge -- $35B in annual losses within the healthcare industry due to failures in temperature-controlled logistics, stemming from delays, temperature excursions, communication gaps, and inadequate chain-of-custody tracking. We're helping introduce ZoomLogi co-founders, Olivier Causse and Saad Shahzad, to progressive leaders at pharma companies to better understand their needs. 

ZoomLogi provides software that helps prevent temperature-controlled logistics failures through real-time visibility coupled with predictive recommendations, alerts, location / courier analytics, and digitally tracked chain of custody, all surfaced in a modern dashboard. ZoomLogi can help assess risk of failure for every shipment. 

ZoomLogi is backed by leaders in healthcare including General Catalyst, Virtue, Eclipse Ventures, VP Development at Alexion, Ex- VP Operations at Gilead, Ex- Head of Biologics Manufacturing at Allergan, and Ex-Head of Logistics & Compliance at Bristol Myers Squibb.
