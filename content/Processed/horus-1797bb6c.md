A recent paper identified significant gaps in billing for tobacco-cessation services for a multihospital health system. Underbilling can reflect poor billing practices, low rates of tobacco-cessation counseling, or a combination of both. The study design was applied to 2 academic medical centers. Deidentified data from the electronic medical records systems were used to identify adult tobacco users and their insurance coverage for patients who had visits to primary care clinics. The propor- tion of office visits where cessation services were billed was calculated. An economic evaluation of the missed counseling opportunities was based on insurance type and a fee-for-service-payment model. Billing of cessation services is consistently below 2% across the medical centers studied, sug- gesting substantial opportunities to improve quality and increase revenue. The prevalence of tobacco use in the patient populations studied was significantly lower than reported for that state by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

## INTRODUCTION

A recent study identified low rates of billing for tobacco-ces- sation interventions in a large, multistate health delivery sys- tem,¹ suggesting not only numerous missed opportunities to bill for or even provide cessation services but also a substan- tial impact on health system revenue. According to clinical guidelines, cessation interventions can and should be pro- vided at every office visit, regardless of a patient's readiness to change.² There is consistent reporting of poor performance in provision of tobacco-cessation services in primary care set- tings.³ This finding is confirmed from a variety of sources such as the National Health Interview Survey,⁴ medical claims data,⁴ and papers based on electronic medical records (EMRs).¹ These studies also identify wide variation in the performance of individual clinicians, medical clinics, and medical groups.⁵,⁶
The model identified office visits by tobacco users when a cessation intervention could have been billed to Medicare, Medicaid, and commercial insurers, and it calculated billable fees for optimal guideline-based treatment. The rev- enue impact of smoking cessation intervention has direct implications in fee-for-service care, but for value-based contracts, there might be even greater downstream gains.⁷ The objective of this study was to understand whether this pattern of billing is representative of other health systems.

## METHODS

The methodology validated in the author team's previ- ous work¹ was extended to 2 additional academic medical centers to comprise 3 discrete retrospective cohort studies. Deidentified patient health data were extracted from each health system's EMRs and claims database: (1) WellSpan Health, an 8-hospital health sys- tem with over 200 outpatient care locations across Penn- sylvania and Maryland; (2) Vanderbilt University Medical Center, the largest academic medical center in the state of Tennessee, with 7 hospitals and over 180 ambulatory locations; and (3) Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, part of the UCLA Health System.
Tobacco use status was identified for each primary care encounter with patients meeting 1 or more of the following criteria: (1) ICD-10 codes indicative of current nicotine dependence and tobacco use of any kind, inclu- sive of vaping, chewing, or dual use; (2) tobacco use identified from the EMR problem lists, encounter diag- noses, and billing records; (3) coding of an encounter for tobacco cessation; or (4) a prescription for a medication with an indication for tobacco cessation.
Eligible encounters were those involving primary care clinicians in outpatient or telemedicine settings during the treatment years (January 1, 2020–December 3, 2023). Patients aged <18 years on the encounter date were excluded. Patients with insurance other than Medi- care, Medicaid, or commercial coverage or uninsured were deemed not eligible and excluded from calculations on the basis of missed billing opportunities.
Tobacco-cessation counseling codes, Current Proce- dural Terminology 99406 (brief counseling, 3–10 minutes) or 99407 (intensive counseling, >10 minutes), determined whether the encounter was billed.
Potential revenue from missed billing opportunities was calculated using standard Medicare's 2023 physician fee schedule for Current Procedural Terminology code 99406, Brief Tobacco Cessation Counselling, to ensure that estimates were conservative. Adjustments to the reimbursement rate for commercial insurance (1.4x Medicare rate) and Medicaid (0.7 × Medicare rate) represent conservative estimates of payment for a large number of diverse payors.⁹,¹⁰ All insurance con- tracts were modeled as fee for service. Data from the 3 or 4 years were averaged to establish comparisons between health systems.

## RESULTS

The percentage of encounters where tobacco cessation was billed was low for all 3 health systems. WellSpan had the lowest rate at 0.3%, followed by Vanderbilt at 1.04% and UCLA at 1.6%. The potential lost revenue per year for each health system was $1,982,339; $805,553; and $314,931, respectively (Table 1). The prevalence of tobacco use based on the EMR was consistently lower than the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention– reported prevalence for the state.

## DISCUSSION

In each health system evaluated, there is a significant gap between the opportunities to provide cessation services and the services actually billed. There are several ways to interpret these data: billable visits are not being billed, opportunities to provide cessation services are being missed, or a combination of the 2. The dollar value of optimal billing of eligible visits based on the patients' insurance is substantial but may be overstated by the model. Although services are likely being provided, the lack of concomitant billing evidence points to either poor data quality or worse: many missed opportunities to provide com- prehensive cessation services.
This model is dependent on the reliable identification of tobacco users and documentation in the EMR. In each data set, the EMR-calculated prevalence is lower than the statewide prevalence, suggesting an opportunity for improvement. A systematic approach to identifica- tion of tobacco users can serve as a foundation for a suc- cessful tobacco control strategy.¹¹
The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality has examined the barriers to implementation of tobacco-ces- sation services and has advocated for systems change.¹² Surveys of clinicians described limited time to provide treatment, lack of training, low reimbursement rates, perceived lack of efficacy, low patient motivation, and insufficient use of health information technology as common reasons for not providing cessation services.¹³,¹⁴ The call for system change is frequently reiterated but has not included discussion of reimburse- ment.¹⁵–¹⁷ Standardized approaches to the identification of tobacco users and training primary care clinicians more effectively in both cessation techniques and appro- priate billing practices could enhance service provision and health outcomes. In settings where systems-based approaches have been fully implemented,¹⁸ capture of smoking status and counseling improved significantly. Adoption of Million Hearts, one of the most widely pro- moted systems change approaches, has been slow.¹⁹,²⁰
In the National Health Interview Survey results, 7.3% of participants report counseling, and 36.3% used medi- cations. If the same pattern holds for the 3 health sys- tems measured, then it is likely that a substantial fraction of unbilled visits are reimbursable. The data from National Committee for Quality Assurance Con- sumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems surveys reveals that over 70% of tobacco users receive advice to quit.²¹ If documentation standards are met, these visits would be reimbursable as well. Nonetheless, the billing rate of 1%–2% of eligible encounters suggests that opportunities to provide cessation services are missed entirely. Repetition, reinforcement, and follow- up of tobacco-cessation interventions have been shown to increase quit rates.²
The consideration of improved revenue generation depends on the payer contracts. The reimbursement estimates are based on fee-for-service payment for all insurance types, where, if all missed opportunities were billed, the additional revenue per year would be substan- tial. Full attainment of the calculated revenue is unlikely to be achieved because some sessions may be missed or patients may refuse. Most health systems have a mixture of fee-for-service and value-based contracts. Value-based contracts set medical expense goals on the basis of previ- ous utilization. When medical expenses are lower than predicted, the savings are shared by the insurer and the medical group. National data suggest that up to 40% of Medicare Advantage and 17% of commercial plans share the risk of excess medical expense and the savings asso- ciated with improved healthcare status.²² The impact of tobacco cessation for value-based contracts may be even greater because it is one of the few preventive services that both is cost-effective and produces a direct return on investment.²³,²⁴ Although additional revenue can be generated by improving the billing, increasing the fre- quency and intensity of the cessation services will add additional expense.²⁵
Health systems and medical practices are encouraged to perform this type of analysis within their EMR sys- tems. Improvement opportunities such as suboptimal tobacco use identification and variation in practice per- formance can be identified.²⁶ Health systems should not overlook the systemic barriers that inhibit the effective delivery of tobacco-cessation interventions.²⁷ The best outcomes can be achieved by adopting a systems change approach,²⁰,²⁸ ensuring that clinicians advise tobacco users to quit at every visit and follow through with docu- mented, billable interventions supporting cessation efforts.

## Limitations

Study findings are limited to 3 healthcare systems and may not generalize to other settings. Not all tobacco users are identified, and some users identified may have recently quit. The types of tobacco used were not avail- able. The model overstates the potential revenue capture because optimal delivery of cessation interventions may not be attainable, and improving the frequency and intensity of cessation services will require additional cli- nician time and administrative expense.

## CONCLUSIONS

The findings from this study demonstrate a discrepancy between the frequency of visits by tobacco users and the proportion at which tobacco-cessation services are billed. Beyond opportunities to enhance billing, the mea- surement of counseling services provides a metric for the effectiveness of tobacco-cessation interventions and can serve to improve both clinical and economic outcomes.
