## Slide 3: Problem

Passionate Autism Care Providers
are Forced into Profit Machines by PE
Leading to 72% Burnout

## Slide 4: Problem

Providers want to leave these clinics, but it is financially and
operationally complex.

*   **Contracting Struggles**
    It isn't easy to get group contracts and the process will take upwards of 180 days.
*   **Expensive Software**
    It costs on average $800/mo for all the software you need to run an autism care clinic.
*   **Hiring Staff to Deliver Care**
    Unique to autism care, you need to hire staff that delivers the direct one-to-one therapy.
*   **Managing Working Capital**
    Providers would need to float up to $150,000 of working capital to keep their company alive.

## Slide 5: Solution

Empowering providers to start independent practices, and
supporting them through each step of the journey

*   **Marketing & Referrals**
    Broaden exposure with the only ABA-focused provider directory.
    *(Image shows a map with icons for "Your Location", "+3 Assessments Started", "+4 Active Clients", "+5 Inquiries")*
*   **Insurance Contracting**
    Get credentialed with major insurance as fast as possible.
    *(Image shows logos for CVS Health, UnitedHealthcare, Cigna, BlueCross BlueShield, Aetna, Optum, Humana, Medicaid, Kaiser Permanente, Anthem, and a fox logo)*
*   **Fully Managed Financials**
    Integrated RCM and Payroll for instant payments and less claim denials.
    *(Image shows a "Billing Tracker" with "Billed Sessions" table)*
    *   Date: 01/01/2023, Description: Assessments, Total Amount: $1,229.93
    *   Date: 01/07/2023, Description: Therapy, Total Amount: $13,569.07
    *   Date: 01/14/2023, Description: Therapy, Total Amount: $15,723.52
*   **End-to-end Software**
    All workflows encapsulated within the EHR for true turn-key experience
    *(Image shows an "Appointment" view with Guests Amy Johnson, Ryan Crowley, Robert Jones, and "Indirect" section)*

## Slide 6: Solution

## Slide 10: Why Now?

Private Equity autism care companies are unwinding their assets
and selling them off as diagnosis increase

*(Image of a child in a window)*

**1/36**
Kids Diagnosed

*   **Parents Stranded For Care**
    Each family we chat with mentions how a PE company has completed ruined the industry.
*   **Increasing Diagnosis**
    Autism diagnoses are up 200% since the early the 2000s, where the incidence rate was 1/150 kids

## Slide 11: Market

Finni is the infrastructure layer between passionate providers and
families who are desperately seeking services

*   **54,000 Providers**
    90% of providers want to start their own practice or work at a BCBA-led practice

    | Provider Type           | Percentage |
