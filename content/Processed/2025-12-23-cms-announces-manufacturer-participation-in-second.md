The CMS process for the second cycle of negotiations will include robust engagement with drug companies and the public, including the following steps:

* Invite each participating drug company with a selected drug to engage in a meeting on its data submission.
* Host 15 patient-focused roundtable events (one for each selected drug) that will be open to patients, patient advocacy organizations, and caregivers. These events are intended to collect patient-focused input on topics such as patient experience, therapeutic alternative(s) to the selected drugs, the extent to which the selected drugs address unmet medical needs, and the impact of selected drugs on specific populations. For additional information or to register, please click [here](/node/2100816). Participant registration is open until March 19, 2025.
* Host one town hall meeting for practicing clinicians, researchers, and other interested parties to discuss clinical considerations related to all the selected drugs. For additional information or to register, please click [here](https://www.cms.gov/inflation-reduction-act-and-medicare/medicare-drug-price-negotiation/2027-public-engagement-events). Participant registration is open until March 19, 2025.
* Send an initial offer for each selected drug with CMS’ proposal for the maximum fair price and concise justification no later than June 1, 2025. The participating drug company will have 30 days to respond by accepting the initial offer or providing a counteroffer, if desired. In developing an initial offer, CMS will consider evidence related to therapeutic alternatives as well as other factors, such as costs related to research and development, production, and distribution of the selected drug. CMS will invite the drug company to a negotiation meeting to take place during the 30-day period after CMS sends the initial offer and before the response from the drug company is due to begin negotiation discussions.
* If agreement on a maximum fair price is not reached through the initial offer or counteroffer, CMS will invite each participating drug company to up to two additional negotiation meetings during Summer and Fall 2025 before the negotiation period ends on November 1, 2025.
