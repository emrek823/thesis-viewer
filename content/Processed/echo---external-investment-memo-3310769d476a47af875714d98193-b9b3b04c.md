## Executive Summary

Echo is building patient and provider-facing technology to facilitate parental involvement in autism therapy and an assessment clearinghouse to enable health plans to measure and standardize high-quality autism care. Matthew Manders, who was most recently the former #2 at Cigna after a 30-year career, brings n-of-1 experience in the payer world to help scale Echo's product to health plans across the nation.

The prevalence of ASD has tripled over the last 20 years, but the lack of high-quality providers has bottlenecked supply and left payers frustrated. Echo directly addresses these supply bottlenecks by tapping an underutilized and highly engaged resource (parents/families) while directly targeting the needs of health plans. Echo is bringing product and business model innovation to scale a robust and proven clinical model for parent training that has been validated by one of the largest RCTs in autism in 2015.

The current Echo product leverages Tom's previous expertise at Ally Home Care to build technology that providers, families, and payers will actually use. This initial wedge allows Echo to collect valuable data in a space lacking clear data or quality standards, and build deep integrations with health plans who are in dire need of solutions.

The autism space has seen increased investment activity and company formation over the last 5 years, but no players have cemented themselves as a leader in parent training or as a go-to partner for payers. Echo can capital efficiently scale to at least 1 large health plan contract ($500K+ ACV) with this round while continuing to invest in product (assessment clearinghouse, parent/provider tools) for long-term growth.

Virtue co-led the $2M pre-seed financing at a $10.4M post-money cap (SAFE) with a $600K check for ~5.7% ownership. Co-investors include NEA ($600K) and management ($800K).

## Team

Tom and Jason have experience building software solutions providers and patients love and actually use from their experience at Ally (home health practice management), while Matt Manders brings n-of-1 experience in the payer world to help scale Echo's product to payers across the nation.

## Echo Overview

Echo sells through health plans to provide a comprehensive solution that enables providers at ABA clinics to offer parent training - a clinically validated approach that providers get reimbursed for but is underutilized today (only ~10% of families).

**Echo Provider and Patient Workflow.** Once a child is diagnosed with ASD and referred to an ABA therapy company, the provider (typically a BCBA) requests pre-authorization for a parent training assessment. Echo is triggered by the health plan to engage patients following this pre-authorization request. The initial assessment is performed using Echo's provider-facing application and typically takes 1 hour, and goals are personalized for each child based on the provider's evaluation. The goals for families include brushing teeth independently, playing with other children in a community setting for 15 minutes without throwing a tantrum, playing with other children without biting them for some period of time, and a variety of other personalized goals. On average, each family will have 5-10 goals per year. Parents will interact with the app daily or weekly depending on goals, and a reassessment is performed by the provider every six months to confirm or change the care plan.

### How It Works:

Here are the steps in the Echo workflow:
1.  **Welcome packet presented to family** including parent assessment, training tutorials, & Autism FAQs. Echo support team available to family for support and assistance.
2.  **Provider submits pre-authorization request & Echo is introduced to family.**
3.  **Family completes "Parent Assessment" on Echo.**
    *   Parent Assessment allows for a more targeted treatment plan from the start of care. This data is shared with the provider.
4.  **Provider completes assessment using data from Parent Assessment.**
5.  **Provider assigns stakeholder goals on Echo.**
    *   Providers select from a list of common stakeholder goals and/or create custom goals that are assigned to the family. Echo will proactively reach out to families if progress is not being made.
6.  **Family completes goals using Echo.**
    *   Family receives reminders and prompts to complete goals. Echo team provides proactive training and outreach to families. All progress data available to payers to assist in claim decision.

## Why now?

The prevalence of ASD has tripled over the last 20 years, but the lack of high-quality providers has bottlenecked supply and left payers frustrated. Echo directly addresses these supply bottlenecks by tapping an underutilized and highly engaged resource (parents/families) while directly targeting the needs of health plans.

**Autism Prevalence has Tripled over Last 20 Years.** In 2001, 1 in 150 children was diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder ("ASD"). Today, the CDC estimates that about 1 in 36 children are diagnosed with ASD (2M+ children in US). The increased prevalence is driven by earlier detection of ASD, better tools for screening and diagnosis, and increased awareness and reduction of stigma around ASD.

**Growing Spend.** After a diagnosis of autism, children are in treatment for the rest of their childhood and often into well into adulthood, especially for those with additional intellectual disabilities. The average annual cost for an individual with ASD is $50K - $100K per year, with lifetime costs >$2m. Overall in the US, the costs for autism today are $200B, with another 2M cases to be identified over the next 10 years given similar increases in prevalence we've seen over the last 10 years.

**Coverage and Reimbursement for Autism Therapy.** In 2001, Indiana was the only state that passed legislation to mandate coverage for individuals diagnosed with ASD. While the exact mandate by state and type of plan (ACA, medicaid, fully-insured, etc) may differ, in 2023 all 50 states have undergone insurance reform to increase access to autism service. In addition, in January 2019 the AMA established permanent Category I CPT codes for Adaptive Behavior Services. Depending on the state, service location and type of service offered, reimbursement can range from $30-$50K per patient per year.

**Supply / Demand Imbalance.** Between 2018 and 2022, the number of BCBAs in the U.S. increased by 2.2x, from 27,320 to 59,976. Despite this growth, more than half of all counties in the US lack a single BCBA. Among the counties with a BCBA, the ratio of autistic children to therapists varies radically from fewer than 18 up to 328 children per therapist. The average retention of an ABA behavior technician is only 6 to 9 months and waitlists in most geographies are 6-12 months.

**Payers pushing back on outcomes.** A new wave of private equity providers have grown rapidly over the last 3-5 years to fill this supply gap, but payers are beginning to push back. Payers need to expand capacity (e.g., reduce arduous documentation), innovative on utilization management and fraud, waste, and abuse (e.g., review outcomes data), and improve quality (e.g., create high quality networks). The access and coverage guaranteed by states and reimbursement for CPT codes provide a solid framework for provider payments, but do not necessarily guarantee higher reimbursement rates. Payers have kept reimbursement rates flat over the last decade, which is an effective rate cut with inflation and increases in staffing costs. Payers are willing to pay increased rates for high-quality care, but are struggling to find partners that can help them deliver.

## Clinical Evidence: Scaling an Evidence-based Model

The most effective care delivery companies in digital health (e.g., Landmark) leverage validated clinical models proven out in certain geographies and/or care settings and scale them with product and business model innovation. Parent training (specifically RUBI based on ABA) has been validated by one of the largest RCTs in autism in 2015, and large academic medical centers (e.g., UCSF, Stanford) have even replaced ABA therapy to exclusively offer parent training. Today, Echo is more focused on ABA given reimbursement frameworks today and current evidence base, but parent training has the potential to drive value outside of the clinic and into real-world circumstances for all modalities.

**Other Evidence-based Treatments.** ASD is a heterogeneous disorder with multiple comorbidities that requires personalized and evidence-based assessments and interventions. The varied and complex needs of individuals and families with autism is represented in the wide range of interventions available today (table below).

| Category | Theoretical Premise | Examples |
| :------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------- |
| Behavioral | Children learn new skills based primarily on the consequences of their behavior (operant learning) | ABA, EIBI, DTT, PECS, PBS |
| Developmental | Children learn new skills primarily through interactions with people and environments (cognitive and social constructivist theories) | DIR Floortime; PACT |
| Naturalistic Developmental Behavioral Interventions | Children learn new skills, through interactions with other people and environments (behavioral and constructivist theories) | ESDM, PRT, JASPER |

Parents are overwhelmed by these treatment choices today and most of these options are costly and time-intensive. Families and children need empirically supported, time-limited, and cost-effective treatments for ASD that generalize skills to drive lasting outcomes in the real-world, not just in therapy. Parental and family involvement directly addresses these needs.

**Parent Training as Framework:** Parent training is a tool that can be used to extend the impact of interventions outside of the clinic and drive sustained outcomes regardless of the specific intervention or symptoms targeted. RUBI (more below) is based on the principles of ABA, while Joint Attention, Symbolic Play, Engagement, and Regulation (JASPER) and the Early Start Denver Model (ESDM) are based on the theory naturalistic developmental behavioural interventions (NDBIs).

### Parent Training in Autism Spectrum Disorder
*(Bearss, Burrell, Stewart & Scahill, 2015)*

*   **Parent Support (Knowledge-focused): Child is Indirect Beneficiary**
    *   Care Coordination
    *   Psychoeducation
*   **Parent-Mediated Intervention (Technique-focused): Child is Direct Beneficiary**
    *   Core Symptoms
        *   Primary (JASPER)
        *   Complementary (ESDM)
    *   Maladaptive Behaviors
        *   Primary (RUBI-PT)
        *   Complementary (Feeding Day Treatment)

*Variations in format, location, intensity, duration, target age range*

**History of Evidence for RUBI (ABA-based).** Parent training is a technique well established in typical developing children with 30+ years of rigorous evaluation with several models with empirical support (Kazdin Method of Parenting, Barkley's Defiant Child, etc). Almost 20 years ago, an NIMH Ad Hoc committee along with several research papers (link, link) recognized the current limitations of research and outlined steps to move the field forward. One intervention highlighted was parent training, but the research and discussion was limited to questions around feasibility ("do parents show up?"). In 2013, a literature review found that only one study was adequately powered to definitively show the value of parent training. Trials with small sample sizes, nonrandom treatment assignment, poorly characterized samples, and manualized procedures hindered replication of the outcomes at scale that families were seeing anecdotally.

This changed in 2015 with the first large-scale (n=180) RCT for parent training published in JAMA. The intervention, now known as RUBI for the Research Units in Behavioral Intervention Autism Network that formalized the program, is based on the same principles as ABA and targets disruptive behaviors and adaptive skills. Parents who received individual behavioral parent training reported increases in compliance and decreases in problem behavior as measured by parent-report on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) and Home Situations Questionnaire (below) and high compliance (96.7%)

**Chart: Reduction in challenging behavior**

| Time Point | Control group - Parent education (ABC-I Score) | Treatment group - RUBI program (ABC-I Score) |

| Baseline   | 23.9                                           | 23.7                                         |
| Week 12    | 18.5                                           | 16.6                                         |

| :--------- | :--------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| Baseline   | 4.0                                            | 3.8                                          |
| Week 12    | 3.0                                            | 2.6                                          |
| Week 24    | 2.5                                            | 1.8                                          |

Since this seminal study, additional research has validated these outcomes in different formats, including telehealth in community mental health centers and schools, in group settings, and group delivery of the intervention over zoom during the pandemic.

Today, RUBI (or slight modifications of the program) is typically offered at academic medical centers or children's hospitals for families on an ABA waitlist or for those that don't have access in their geographies. Some centers (UCSF, Stanford) have taken the next step to only offer parent training and no longer provide ABA. Although anecdotal, providers estimate that ~70% of families could completely replace ABA with parent training based on their needs and complexity.

## Product: Initial Engagement Drives Long-term Differentiation

The current Echo product leverages Tom's previous expertise at Ally Home Care to build technology that providers, families, and payers will actually use. This initial wedge allows Echo to collect valuable data in a space lacking clear data or quality standards and build deep integrations with health plans who are in dire need of solutions. Over time, these integrations and data will allow Echo to improve personalized outcomes for families (e.g., which form of therapy is best for a 7 year old with intellectual disabilities?), drive revenue and reduce turnover for providers (e.g., BCBAs are driving $40K in additional revenue per year with new CPT codes) and identify and drive cost-savings for payers (cost-savings of 50% between highest and lowest quality providers).

### Echo Product Components and Workflow

*   **Family:** Echo is designed specifically for ease of use and optimal user experience based on the team's extensive experience designing best in class software applications that facilitate involvement and activity from Ally. At Ally, Tom and Jason built a software application used by both seniors and caregivers, who are both notoriously technologically challenged. The team has learned the non-obvious and "unsexy" product workflows (schedule capability, crafting automated daily check-in prompts) that can drive their goal of daily and weekly engagement depending on the care plan.
    *   *Visual shows a mobile app with a "Schedule" and "Check In" feature for daily activities and behaviors exhibited.*
*   **Provider (BCBA):** Echo will be a separate web-based application for providers in addition to their EMR. Over time, Echo will become more integrated into provider workflows, but BCBA's today are using manual, paper-based workflows and are actively asking for novel solutions to track their patient panel, a portal to submit reimbursement, and standardize goal-setting and care plans to understand outcomes.
    *   *Visual shows a web interface for a BCBA with patient data and a calendar.*
*   **Payer Assessment Clearinghouse:** Echo will integrate with a health plan's internal claims system and software used by case managers for review queuing and external notifications. Today, case managers are receiving faxes and emails for assessment authorization with no ability to understand how many providers are utilizing parent training, let alone who is providing quality care. Echo will not only be able to standardize current processes to drive more efficient care, but collect valuable data to measure average claim duration per provider and make assessments of top performing providers.
    *   *Visual shows a dashboard with data for "Quality of Care," "Provider Performance," and "Claims Adjudication."*

## Business Model Breakdown: PEPM Today, VBC in Future

Today, Echo's technology is enabling providers to provide parental training to families and gives payers an assessment clearinghouse to gain visibility into quality of care and outcomes. Going forward, Echo has the potential to build a broader enablement layer to become a tech-enabled network of high quality autism providers and capture a larger portion of payer spend ($10K - $20K per patient per year).

### Business Model: Today vs. Future

**Today (Payers)**
*   Reimbursing CPT codes $100-$150 per provider per month for parent training
*   Echo charges $100-$200 PEPM + $50/assessment
*   ABA Clinic receives Reimbursement for ABA Services

**Future (Payers)**
*   Tech-enabled network of high-quality autism providers (Echo)
*   Connects ABA Clinics and Family Only

**Current Model.** Currently, there are 2 pieces to Echo's revenue model - annualized per enrolled member (PEPM) and fee per assessment that gets transmitted from providers (every 6 months for a patient). Based on payer conversations, Echo estimates they can charge at least $200/month ($2400 annual) for the PEPM fee and $50 per provider assessment. Importantly, Echo is providing a service that rolls under medical costs for health plans vs. a software vendor coming out of plans' admin budget, which reduces profits with MLR restrictions.

**Future.** Over the next 2-3 years as Echo starts to demonstrate improved engagement, sustained clinical outcomes, and reduction in total cost of care, the company can move into risk-based arrangements. VBC in autism is nascent so while the exact structure of the arrangement is unknown today, we look to comps in the mental health market and the “spread” between current costs of ABA ($50K) and parent training ($5-$10K) to understand potential value capture.

For example, Firsthand, a company focused on SMI - a patient population with similar annual costs today around $50K annually - has signed contracts with payers for $575 PEMPM + 50%. Their model leverages peer support (a motivated, lower-cost, and underutilized supply) while Echo targets parents and families (a motivated, low-cost and underutilized supply). If Echo can avoid expensive ABA clinics ($50K) and provide lower-cost parent training ($10K) and share up to 50% of the savings with payers ($50% x ($50K - $10K) = $20K. We conservatively assume that Echo could generate $10K - $20K per patient in VBC arrangements in the future.

## GTM: Delivering Value for Payers to Scale Adoption

Management will leverage their experience and rolodex in the health plan space to secure initial payer contracts while thoughtfully creating value over the near, mid, and long-term to expand within initial plans and expand to new plans.

**Initial Payer Rollout.** Echo will prioritize initial roll out for 500-1000 members with health plans based on the following dimensions:
*   Critical mass
*   Quality and access of care
*   Large national/strategic providers who can scale our clearinghouse
*   Economic demographics

### Echo is seeking a limited release with 500-1000 members

**Initial Steps:**
1.  Build and integrate assessment clearinghouse with top health plan and establish baseline measurement criteria
2.  Complete parent mobile app and parent assessments workflow
3.  Establish provider incentive program and ensure stakeholder goals are assigned to parents
4.  Continue refining programs & training material in conjunction with our therapy team

Depending on the state and demographic, 30%-40% of children are on medicaid with the majority of the rest of the population in commercial plans. Echo will prioritize payers with the specific characteristics that best balance these dimensions to maximize the probability of a successful limited release.

**Value Creation.** Echo's assessment clearinghouse can provide administrative value immediately to health plans. Over time as the clearinghouse captures more data, Echo will achieve statistical credibility and publish information on provider performance - both at a micro and macro level. Below is an example of how this value accrues and can build over time:
*   **6 months** - Complete assessment clearinghouse and parent mobile app and begin integrating with insurer workflow (e.g., how Echo is introduced, the new process for submitting assessments etc.)
*   **12 months** - Progress data is being measured in Echo clearinghouse and direct integration is complete with insurer software systems.
*   **18 months** - Demonstrate quality measurement algorithms and Echo recommendations in assessment clearinghouse. Echo will start measuring progress for providers and identifying top performing providers / preferred provider network.

## Competition

The autism space has seen increased investment activity and company formation over the last 5 years with growing prevalence and reimbursement frameworks in place, but no players have cemented themselves as a leader in parent training and as a go-to partner for payers. In addition to the representative list of competitors below (see table), we expect continued activity in the space from novel players with new approaches (e.g., Amol Deshpande launching AI video-based platform to codify and democratize therapy).

### Competitor Landscape

| Provider-focused platforms | Next-gen Providers | Parental Training |
| :------------------------ | :----------------- | :---------------- |
| **Enabling BCBA's to go Independent** | **Venture-backed** | **Tech platform** |
| Elemy | Cortica | Echo |
| Finni | Springtide Child Development | Forta |
| **EHR** | **PE platforms** | **Virtual BCBAs** |
| Spectrum.Ai | Hopebridge Autism Therapy Centers | Huey |
| | CARD Center For Autism And Related Disorders | |

**Provider-focused platforms.** Elemy and Finni are looking to enable entrepreneurial BCBA's to go independent while Spectrum.AI is providing an EHR to ABA clinics and additional tools for payers.
*   **Elemy** (founded in 2019, $1.15B valuation, $300M+ in funding from Softbank, GC, 8VC, and others): Started scaling ABA clinics in CA, FL, and TX, reaching a $18M run-rate in 2022. The company is currently shifting to a marketplace model to link families to entrepreneurial BCBA's to start their own practices leveraging Elemy's tech platform and services (e.g., insurance contracting + credentialing, client acquisition, RCM, etc).
*   **Finni** (YC W23; $2.5m raised @ $25m valuation) provides a similar platform to Elemy for BCBA's to go independent. In February 2023, Finni had $28K in MRR, and was growing 50% MoM with 4 active providers ($7k MRR per provider).
*   **Spectrum.Ai** ($20M Series A in Q1 ‘23 led by CVS Health Ventures) offers 2 solutions - twyll (ABA EHR for providers) and patterns (ABA network analytics). The company recently signed a deal with LEARN Behavioral (5000 providers in 19 states) with CARR of $15M ( $250/provider/month). Spectrum also has payer/provider pilots in development with Evernorth (expedited authorization), Humana (UM/audit efficiencies for Tricare), and Optum and Elevance (express self-insured employer access to high-quality providers).

**Next-gen Providers.** The first PE platform was formed in 2010, and today 50+ PE firms currently hold or held a majority stake in an autism services platform with 185 deals in the last 5 years alone. The general perception of some of these providers is that these institutional sponsors are “predatory” and “chasing rich reimbursement, with less regard for children and families”.

**Parental Training.** Huey provides virtual BCBA services to families as a standalone solution. Forta (fka Montera) provides a broader tech platform but also is providing virtual services and is directly billing CPT codes (e.g., usage-based revenue model) as opposed to Echo's model of enabling providers and provider a payer-focused solution while leveraging payers for customer acquisition.
*   **Huey** (no funding, currently fundraising) uses BCBA's to virtually provide parent training for families and directly bill for those services. Huey recently became a "Kaiser-affiliated provider” and will receive standalone reimbursement ($2.6K - $4K) outside of the traditional 3-tier ABA program. They are currently raising a $3m seed.
*   **Forta** (~$20M in total funding led by Insight Partners; raised uncapped note in 2022). In 2022, Forta hit a $2.5M+ run-rate by acquiring patients D2C and directly billing parent training CPT codes. Forta is heavily invested in using AI to automate the generation of the therapy program (based on medical record data, eye movement, speech patterns, etc) and reduce the need for RBTs. They are pursuing FDA breakthrough designation to reduce the need for RBTs in the workflow.

### Forta Delivery

| Role      | Select treatment pathway, Executes therapy programs, Interface with patients through telehealth | Generates, Review and approve therapy program, Reviews data metrics of RBT performance | Generate therapy program, Automate tasks with RPA, Provide performance insights |

**Solution: AI-driven treatment pathway selection with BCBA review**
*   Consistent Experience - outcomes less dependent on RBT quality
*   Efficient Operations - automation eases monitoring & RBTs reach more patients across geographies
*   Easier Recruitment - lower BCBA to RBT ratio & less stringent RBT intake

## Financing / Milestones

Echo can capital efficiently scale to at least 1 large health plan contract ($500K+ ACV) with this round while continuing to invest in product (assessment clearinghouse, parent/provider tools) for long-term growth.

**Milestones:** Echo has 2 key milestones with this round that can trigger a subsequent financing.
*   Secure a health plan and scale up from initial release for 500-1000 members.
*   Scale the assessment clearinghouse with providers and insurers and prove that insurers require or at least encourage the use of the clearinghouse because it simplifies workflows for all constituents.

**Revenue assumptions.** The main assumptions driving revenue growth are the PEPM rate and enrollment adoption assumption.
*   **PEPM Rate - $200:** Based on comps in market for behavioral health (SMI, SUD) and medically complex children (Spark Pediatrics) and Echo's initial conversation with payers, we believe this $200 PEPM rate is an appropriate base case. In certain scenarios, Echo may give discounts to plans that can make up for the this discount with volume increases.
*   **Enrollment Adoption - 50%:** Typically, we see adoption for behavioral solutions around 20-30%. We have higher confidence in Echo reaching its 50% engagement rate given initial payer interest (plans are actively pushing providers to utilize CPT codes for parent training), additional revenue potential for providers, and strength of real-world outcomes that families can see in weeks (reduction in family stress) not months.

**Expense Assumptions.** The main drivers of expenses are engineering costs (reasonable at this stage given Tom and Jason's prior experience at JTR solutions) and resources required to deliver services (BCBA's and customer service reps) for health plans. Management's assumptions for the capacity for these roles are also conservative given other comps we've seen in market (1 BCBA:250 members, 1 customer service rep: 200 members).

**50+% Contribution Margin (CM):** As with all care delivery companies, we look at contribution margin when ramped with an initial contract (1000 enrolled members assumed) to understand how these businesses can scale capital efficiently. Echo's product approach (higher gross margin), health plan GTM (reduces CAC), and high PEPM rate drive 50+% contribution margins in this initial phase prior to risk-based arrangements.

## Opportunities / Risks

### Opportunities

*   **Team Built for Product and Sales.** Matthew Manders brings his 30-year experience from Cigna as the effective #2 to open up doors and define initial payer strategy, while Tom can leverage his product experience to drive success and engagement in initial pilots. We always index on teams that show early sign of excellence in product and sales, but even more so in today's current market environment where health plan sales cycles are becoming more difficult.
*   **Need for Autism Services Only Increasing.** The autism space is massive and even companies that “get it half-right" can build transformational, $1B+ businesses.
*   **Directly Addressing Payer Needs at the Right Time.** Echo is entering the market right as payers have started to react to the rapid increase of low-quality providers and are actively asking (almost begging) for new solutions to understand quality and outcomes. Current players, especially Spectrum, have started to address this need but are fundamentally built with a core provider-DNA that make it difficult to fully serve the needs of payers.

### Risks

*   **Competitors Launch Parental Training as Add-on.** Provider-focused platforms could potentially include parent training as an additional module or application on their current platforms. To mitigate this risk, Echo is laser-focused on its payer GTM strategy to secure its foothold with payers, who ultimately control the flow of dollars and benefit from deep integrations of the assessment clearinghouse.
*   **Failure to Drive Increased Rate (%) of Parental Involvement.** Currently, only around 10% of families utilize parent training today. There is a potential risk that technology alone will fail to increase this engagement rate, but the dozens of conversations Echo has had over the last year with providers and families give us and management confidence that this low rate is a function of awareness and accessibility vs. motivation and desire.
*   **PEPM Gets Pushed Down Over Time.** The 50+% contribution margins are driven by strong PEPM reimbursement assumptions (~$200). There is a risk that this PEPM rate is lower than assumed (~$50) or gets pushed down over time, but our conversations with payers have given us confidence that the increasing spend today, growing incidence, and lack of other options can garner these reimbursement rates, which pale in comparison to the $30-$50K for ABA therapy today.
