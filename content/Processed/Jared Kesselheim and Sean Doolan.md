### Relationship Reset Discussion

- Jared acknowledged multiple frustrating interactions between TCAP and Virtue over recent months
- TCAP team has high respect for Virtue as firm and Sean’s leadership
- Both parties committed to rebuilding positive working relationship going forward
- Sean emphasized continued high regard for TCAP as best-in-class healthcare investor at their stage

### LP Information Breach - Mural Health

- Virtue shared Q2 update mentioning new product release for portfolio company Mural Health
- TCAP team member screenshot LP update, shared internally assuming it was company-generated content
- Information inadvertently reached Mural CEO Sam Whitaker within 24-48 hours
- Sam confronted Sean with “ugly undressing” - questioned trust, firm management
	- Took months to rebuild relationship despite minimal nature of actual information
- Jared acknowledged clear mistake, apologized for breach of LP confidentiality

### Translucent Funding Process Issue

- Portfolio company ran tight preemptive Series A process (4-5 firms only) in Sept/Oct
- Founder Jack explicitly requested no outreach to pipeline client Northwestern during sensitive negotiations
- TCAP team contacted Northwestern during scheduled call, asked about Translucent among other companies
- Northwestern raised questions back to Jack, creating complications in deal process
- Jack “pretty pissed” at TCAP for outreach despite specific request
- Less clear-cut issue given TCAP’s regular customer engagement practices

### Anna Health Investment Withdrawal

- TCAP’s largest position by dollars and ownership percentage
- Virtue brought major LPs as co-investors, adding pressure and sensitivity
- Term sheet signed but deal ultimately didn’t close
- Key factors in withdrawal:
- Blanket sale provision discussion (never formalized):
	- Would have given only Series A lead voting control on sale decisions
	- Sean strongly opposed due to large position and LP involvement
	- Jared clarified this was internal discussion, not actual proposal
- Sean felt TCAP “looking for reasons why not to invest” despite signed term sheet
- Communication issues with some misrepresentation from CEO to Virtue team

### Going Forward

- Both parties committed to direct communication channels to avoid telephone game issues
- Sean specifically requested TCAP call Virtue directly when ambiguity exists on sensitive matters
- TCAP still providing introductions and support (e.g., Akanksha intro to Blue Cross Blue Shield RI for Anna)
- Sean confirmed 100% intent for TCAP participation in future Virtue portfolio company rounds
