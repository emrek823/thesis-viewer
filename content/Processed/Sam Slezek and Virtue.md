### Sam’s Background & Technology Approach

- Previous experience at Instacart and Scale AI
	- Instacart Plus platform: automated pricing, promotions, trials - grew subscription orders from 40% to 60% in 2 years
	- Scale AI: rebuilt platform with 2 engineers, generated $1M/week revenue at 50%+ margins within 3 months
	- Key insight: small teams with AI can have transformative impact in tight timeframes
- Healthcare opportunity: massive spending on credentialing and billing that can be automated
	- Legacy systems at clinic and RCM level can’t support AI transformation
- Team composition:
	- Michael (sales co-founder): ex-Instabase, PT clinic experience
	- Raghav (CTO): ex-Airbnb, built previous company to $2M GMV

### Go-to-Market Strategy & Joint Venture Model

- Theory: going direct to clinics is super inefficient
	- Target service providers who add most value with full-stack AI solution
	- Service providers spend 50%+ of revenue on manual labor that can be automated
- Pittsburgh credentialer joint venture (60:40 ownership split):
	- Current: $530K profit on ~$1M revenue, can’t grow due to manual processes
	- Projection: 10x profit growth in year 1 with AI platform
	- $100K/year deal with Athelas discussing profit share expansion
	- No capital outlay for NextGenMed - partner was grinding and couldn’t serve demand
- Credentialing as wedge into contracting, licensing, billing
- AI impact areas:
	- 2x efficiency from consolidating scattered processes into one platform
	- Simple calls: automated hold time for reference numbers (30-45 minutes saved)
	- Form filling: unstructured data → JSON format for payer sites (Aetna, etc.)
	- Document creation and email automation

### Technology & Competitive Positioning

- 70/30 split: core infrastructure setup vs. domain expertise acquisition
	- Hard part: setting up AI system correctly
	- Relationship game: getting credentialers/billers to teach processes
- AI-assisted coding enables months vs. years for product development
	- Technology differentiation no longer primary hurdle
	- Focus on partnerships with industry experts for distribution
- San Diego biller partnership in pipeline:
	- $8M revenue, $2.5M profit
	- Extremely organized with process mapping and custom reporting tools
	- Willing to teach billing processes for tech platform development
- Targeting smaller clinics vs. big hospitals:
	- Less competition in SMB space
	- Service providers as “Trojan horse” distribution to hundreds of clinics
	- Outdated systems create biggest AI transformation opportunity

### Funding & Next Steps

- Raising: $5M to close before Christmas
- Use of proceeds: scale engineering team, certifications, legal requirements
- Current valuation context: non-tech credentialing companies sell at 2-3x EBITDA, tech-enabled can reach 10x in acquisitions
