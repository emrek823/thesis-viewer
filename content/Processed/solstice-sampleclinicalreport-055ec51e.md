# GASTROENTEROLOGY OPERATIVE/INVASIVE PROCEDURE NOTE

DATE OF PROCEDURE: 8/1/2023 4:00 PM
Patient: [REDACTED]
MRN: [REDACTED]
DOB: [REDACTED]
REFERRING PHYSICIAN: [REDACTED] MD
SURGEON/ENDOSCOPIST: [REDACTED] MD
ASSISTANTS: Endo RN: [REDACTED] RN; [REDACTED] RN
CRNA: [REDACTED] CRNA
Anesthesia/Sedation: See Anesthesiologists note. IV Monitored anesthesia care/general anesthesia per anesthesia.
PROCEDURE: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with duodenal gastric and esophageal biopsies, colonoscopy
Pre-operative Diagnosis: GERD, dysphagia, bloating, personal history of colon polyps
Post-operative diagnosis: Diffuse esophagitis in the lower third of the esophagus, some erythema in the stomach and duodenum
Colonoscopy showed: internal hemorrhoids and a very chronically dilated redundant colon consistent with megacolon. The prep was inadequate and that the right colon had stool so we could only complete the exam to the proximal colon
Indications: Please see previous documentation (consult, progress note, office visit and/or updated focused H&P) for additional details.
ASA Class: 3
Time out: Time-out was performed to confirm the identity of the patient and the nature of the procedure.

Consent: Consent for the procedure were obtained prior to start of the procedure. The benefits, risks, and alternatives to the procedure were discussed and informed consent was obtained from the patient (and/or family members); these risks include but not limited to adverse reaction to the medication, aspiration, infection, bleeding, injury to adjacent organs, pancreatitis, perforation, inability to complete the procedure or necessity for further testing or surgical intervention.
Monitoring: Electrocardiogram, pulse, pulse oximetry, and blood pressure were monitored throughout the procedure.
Medications: Per anesthesia. See anesthesia note.
Scope(s)/Instrument(s): Olympus 190 series gastroscope Olympus 190 series colonoscope
Technical procedure/findings and interventions:
Once the patient was under adequate anesthesia, he was rotated into the left lateral decubitus position. A bite- block was placed in his mouth. The videogastroscope was maneuvered into the esophagus. The esophagus showed pallor and linear furrows and erythema in the lower 1/2-1/3 of the esophagus. There was no stricture. GE junction was at 40 cm. Stomach was viewed in forward and retroflexed view and showed some scattered erythema. Duodenum showed some scattered erythema. Biopsies were obtained in duodenum stomach distal esophagus and proximal esophagus and and sent in jars 1 through 4 respectively. There was no target for dilation.
Digital rectal exam was done and there was some perianal excoriations. Digital rectal exam was otherwise unremarkable. The videocolonoscope was maneuvered through the colon to the ascending colon at which point we encountered solid stool. The colon was noted to be very long and redundant and chronically dilated. Some of the other areas of the colon had liquid stool in it but we were able to suction most of this. The mucosa looked normal otherwise. There were no large polyps seen. There was no obstruction. Retroflex in the rectum showed internal hemorrhoids.
Estimated blood loss: less than one ml
Complications: None
Condition after procedure: Stable
Specimen(s) Removed: As above
Impressions:

*   Esophagitis, gastritis and duodenitis
*   No significant stricture
*   Internal hemorrhoids
*   Long dilated colon
*   Inadequate bowel prep on the right colon
*   History of polyps

Recommendations:
We will contact you with the biopsy results and make further recommendations
Stool soft with escalated stool softeners as necessary, if necessary with MiraLAX and stimulant laxatives as well such as senna
Thank you for allowing us to help with your care
