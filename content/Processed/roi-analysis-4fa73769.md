## Slide 3: ROI Analysis Methodology
### ROI Analysis Methodology
Adonis applied a conservative methodology to model net new revenue generation opportunities created by proactive avoidance of preventable denials*.

**2.3 Million Claims Analyzed from 2021**
**Problem Statement**
[REDACTED] submits over 6,500 claims on behalf of ~200 provider groups nationwide. In 2021, more than 11% of claims are denied by payers representing greater than $40M in denied revenue in 2021 alone. Avoiding preventable and predictable denials requires machine learning and real-time insights powered by an intelligence engine.

**3 Case Studies Across Key Accounts**
**Account Based Analysis**
In order to quantify revenue generation opportunities, Adonis analyzed dozens of key accounts across the [REDACTED] portfolio to quantify (1) denial rates, (2) avoidable denial rates, and (3) revenue generation opportunities based on denial codes and recoverability analysis.

**1000s of RARC Codes Categorized and Classified**
**Portfolio Level View**
Adonis leveraged historic and projected encounter and financial data to identify a total Return on Investment based on avoiding nearly **70k claims annually**, representing **3% of yearly claim volume** and over **30% of all denied claims**. These projections were then discounted by 33% in the spirit of conservatism.

* Avoidable denial codes included in Appendix

## Slide 4: Executive Summary: Avoidable Denials
### Executive Summary: Avoidable Denials
Based on 2021 denial data, Adonis conservatively estimates that nearly 30% of denials were avoidable, representing a potential 3% reduction in overall denial rates.

**2021 Denials Data Table**

|                       | Total Claims Submitted | Denial Rate      | Avoidable Denial Rate |
| :-------------------- | :--------------------- | :--------------- | :-------------------- |
| Enterprise Wide (Active Locations) | 2.3M claims            | 11% (272k claims) | 3% (72k claims)      |

**1 in every 3 denials incurred in 2021 were avoidable, representing 3% of total claim volume across the [REDACTED] portfolio.**

**2021 Claims Overview (Pie Chart)**
*   Accepted Claims: 89%
*   Denied Claims: 11%

**2021 Denials Overview (Pie Chart)**
*   Unavoidable Denials: 67%
*   Avoidable Denials: 33%

(1) Missing / Invalid Claim Data, (2) Timely Filing Violations, and (3) Incompatible Procedure Codes represent the biggest buckets of avoidable denials.

## Slide 5: Executive Summary: Revenue Impact
### Executive Summary: Revenue Impact
Across all [REDACTED] clients, over 72k denials were avoidable, with an average reimbursement per encounter around $750. Historically, [REDACTED] successfully appeals 50% of avoidable denials, resulting in an approximate $27M in lost revenue to [REDACTED] clients.

**Revenue Calculation:**
~$157 x 50% x 72k = 5.7M
*   **Average Expected per Encounter:** ~$157
*   **Collection Rate on Avoidable Denials:** 50%
*   **Total Avoidable Denials:** 72k
*   **Cost of Avoidable Denials:** 5.7M

Each Avoidable Denial Costs [REDACTED] Clients $78.5 on Average.

## Slide 6: Case Study: [REDACTED] (Financial Summary)
### Case Study: [REDACTED] (Financial Summary)
[REDACTED] Regional Emergency Medicine is an [REDACTED] account based in North Carolina. In 2021, a total of 74 billing providers conducted nearly 75k patient encounters. Claims were submitted to over 55 unique payers representing an estimated $13.7M in revenue to [REDACTED].

**Financial Summary Calculation:**
$58M ÷ $45M = 77.3%
*   Expected revenue from payers: $58M
*   Received revenue from payers: $45M
*   Collection rate from payers: 77.3%

## Slide 7: Case Study: [REDACTED] (Denials Summary)
### Case Study: [REDACTED] (Denials Summary)
In 2021, over 8k claims were denied by payers, with a total expected amount around $3.2M. After appeals, only $2.2M was recovered, resulting in a 68% recovery rate. Nearly 25% of denials in 2021 were avoidable with improved scrubbing and intelligence.

**Appeals vs Denied (Pie Chart)**

## Slide 8: Case Study: [REDACTED] (Appeal Summary)
### Case Study: [REDACTED] (Appeal Summary)
In 2021, 2.2k denials at [REDACTED] were avoidable. After these denials were appealed only 58% of the expected revenue was recovered. Resulting in a reduction to overall collection rates. Improved intelligence would have mitigated these losses.

## Slide 9: Case Study: [REDACTED] (Continued)
### Case Study: [REDACTED] (Continued)

**Breakdown of N56 Denial Code by Payer (Bar Chart)**

| Payer   | Count |
| :------ | :---- |
| Humana  | 989   |
| Others  | 40    |

**Adonis Revenue Intelligence Insight**
