The five adjustments are supported by center-level operating realities across collections, supplies, billing, PTO, and training that are not fully captured in the QoE snapshot(1)

| Adjustment Type      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Net Impact   |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| Collections          | PYA’s analysis took a haircut against the contracted rate per unit to adjust for collections percentages; however, this haircut isn’t representative of the timeline to collect (outstanding claims are collectable within 180 days until timely filing). We adjusted the revenue / unit to be equal to the contracted amount per unit. | +0.8% CM     |
| Supplies             | PYA’s analysis amortized all supplies expense at the center-level pro rated across centers; however, the vast majority of supplies expense is one-time setup, and recurring supplies expense are limited to clinical director’s supplies Ramp card budget, which has historically averaged $1,528. | +2.6% CM     |
| Billing              | PYA’s analysis expensed more than our entire biller’s expense against the unit-level P&#x26;L; however, the contracted biller at $24,000 / year is newly hired and manages our technology RCM suite with expectations of overseeing all Massachusetts locations. At 8 locations, biller’s monthly expense is $250. | +1.6% CM     |
| Paid-Time Off (PTO) | PYA expensed all unused PTO at the respective unit levels; however, PTO is granted (not accrued) to BCBAs, which comprised 96% of all unused PTO. This PTO accrues on a 12-month basis, and therefore the P&#x26;L is overburdened with recent hires and full PTO balances. This PTO balance has been removed. | +1.0% CM     |
| Training             | PYA fully-expensed new BTs against the P&#x26;L; however, first 2-weeks of work are non-billable training that are over-represented during ramping periods. The first month’s expense for new BTs is divided by 2 in order to account for training time and better represent mature state of center-level economics. | +1.4% CM     |

(1) Remaining delta driven by the QoE accrual-to-cash timing adjustments and 401(k) burdening assumptions.
