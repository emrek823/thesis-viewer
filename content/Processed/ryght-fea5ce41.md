The Evolving Landscape of Life Sciences Data and Analytics and Impact of LLMs

LLMs can change speed, cost, and performance of back-end data engineering and building user interfaces to connect systems of record (data originators / owners) with systems of intelligence.

Summary: The $20B+ life sciences data and analytics market has gone through a number of evolutions over the last decade, as we’ve moved from bespoke consulting projects to longitudinal claims data for mostly commercial settings and increasing data diversity with companies like Flatiron/FMI (clinico-genomic), and Datavant (tokenized data sets across multiple sources) leading the charge. However, in many cases the data flow from data owner/originator to life sciences application is convoluted and complex. The industry can leverage LLMs in areas where they excel (dealing with unstructured data, require less labeled data, simpler and cheaper model deployment) to continue to increase the breadth and depth of data sources, drive more value to data originators and owners, and meet the evolving needs of more sophisticated biopharma buyer.

Market Overview

When we discuss the life science data and analytics ecosystem, we’re referring to all the solutions, platforms, and data leveraged across the pharmaceutical value chain (below) for clinical operations and commercial use cases. With our focus at Virtue, we are excluding use cases focused on drug discovery (high-throughput screening, protein design, antibody discovery, target ID, etc). Fascinating areas but not our focus!

For reference, we anchor ourselves with performance of the larger players in the space to better frame the opportunity for startups

IQVIA did $5.86B in technology and analytics solutions revenue in 2023 alone with its monopoly on script data in the space and expansion into other technology areas (RWE, study design, launch excellence, brand strategy, etc)

Veeva and Medidata

Norstella

Doximity

Lasso and DeepIntent

Trends

We see the space continuing to evolve as buyers become more sophisticated, the depth and breadth of data type evolves, and use cases expand.

Buyers become more sophisticated: Companies like Roche are investing >$3.3B annually in digitization across the value chain. While we hear many claims of “reduced spending on RWD”, we see this as an evolution and more sophisticated buyer persona that wants to go beyond undifferentiated data assets and has improved internal capabilities (e.g., things as simple as sharing claims data sources among multiple brands or BUs)

Depth and breadth of data evolves: For claims data today, some data aggregators (IQVIA, Symphony Health) aggregate data from many different claims clearinghouses and provider billing systems that cover more patient lives but may not have 100% claims capture for each patient. Others (IBM MarketScan, Optum Insights, Blue Health Intelligence, Inovalon Insights) have data from health plans or self-insured employer groups that tend to cover fewer patient lives, but will have 100% claims capture for each patient. Companies are building on top of the foundation of claims data and leveraging additional data sources (genomics, specialty pharmacy feeds, imaging, SDoH)

Use Cases Evolve: The precision medicine wave is moving outside of oncology (Myokardia in cardiology, Prometheus in IBD, etc) and the same RWD historically leveraged in the commercial space is making its way into clinical trials.

How LLMs Impact the Bespoke Data & Analytics Ecosystem

Before we dive into the impact of LLMs, it’s important to understand the convoluted web of data access/purchasing and the current data journey from origination in “systems of record” to consumption/utilization for many of the use cases we have been describing.

For example, ~50% of Symphony Health Solutions’ dataset (acquired for $530M by PRA) was made of Relay EDI data from McKesson (now under CoverMyMeds brand). Clarivate (which acquired DRG for $935M) is selling direct to pharma and to claims aggregators like Clarify that package multiple datasets and normalize the data to sell to pharma. Many of the most popular datasets and platforms in use today (Citeline, Evaluate, etc) were built in the 2000’s and spun out of Thomson Reuters. In clinical trials in particular, there is an alphabet soup of applications and systems of record that are unnecessarily bespoke (EDC, CTMS, IRT, ePRO, eSource, etc). Why this is the case is the subject for another post but it directly impacts how we view LLMs going forward!

We see LLMs as a new tool to connect systems of record (data originators / owners) with systems of intelligence. We emphasize the importance of LLMs BOTH in back-end data engineering (dealing with unstructured data, expanding capabilities of small but growing data science talent in biopharma/life sciences) and a novel user-interface (which is often highlighted more so given the impact of ChatGPT and other chat interfaces).
