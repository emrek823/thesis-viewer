High-level questions/approach: What changed? Mgmt feels like they are operating under evolving guideposts

Specific timeline (focused on case rates)

Aetna Better Health timeline - affected by change in case rate vs. gainshare strategy and inertia for state (credentialing/RCM) that they have now figured out.

7/28 - Beginning of change in strategy to case rates

In July, the company

7/28 vs. 10/6 pipeline

Biggest update in moving Humana towards $800 case rate (validates strategy and timeline of moving people off the “walking around #”)

Again, 3 months to continue to move the pipeline with this new strategy around case rates that

Was there expectation on 7/28 or 10/6

As of 7/23 (7/28 board meeting)

Specific questions

Concerns around

1. pace of GTM / contracting of case rates;

2. Positive contribution margin per call.

Per previous guidance ~ 90 days ago (July-end / early August - SF trip):

1. EMS call volume - 20 calls / day (NVP)

2. Market-level EBITDA (8VC); didn’t ask to hit specific contribution call / call but wanted to understand mechanics and have confidence of path toward positive contribution margin.

Case rate strategy began in earnest post July 28 (7.28) group call

2-6 months to get FFS + another 3-6 months thereafter to get case rates.

After the 7.28 call were you under the assumption that they would have positive per call contribution margins by now?

We don’t have that anywhere in our notes nor do we believe management had that guidance and/or was timeline (current).

Notes

Irem - Sebastian came to same conclusion

Sebastian

We learned more about EMS value prop - on net, more bullish on that. More work to be done to taxonomize different EMS and what that looks like. Plus integration with EMS

Financial model on the COGS side - great

Revenue side - sticking point

Case rates - $600-$800. That is achievable and we’ll learn how long it takes and what penetration.

Questions on precisely where we land and what time

Payer mix - not just commercial vs. MA vs. medicaid. What % can you not get insurance for?

Unknown on

Payer mix

Exact case rates

Timing

Saying for group - the mindset that we ought to have for a step up in valuation. If this, then our insiders are going to lead

We have no leverage in that discussion - I truly do believe in this blended revenue per visit

Need to bring in external talent - to build a $1B business you have to bring in new people

Talk with them

See urgency to put more money in the business. It’s going to be fine and talk about milestones next year with all the feedback next year

Irem is indexing on a priced round, I’m open to being flexible for

Mainly semantics - if Irem is pushing for priced

Virtue participation

Don’t have a ton of reserves -

Irem

Slower to think about that FFS and how to get to 70-80%

Questions around treat and release and can we make clear actuarial case

Year from now - case rates aren’t going from $800 to $600

“I’m really concerned” about 20% uninsured rate in our markets

How to

Unit economics are nowhere near proven. To have a successful Series A and set this up for success, it's better to set up as seed extension and price it appropriately

$20m pre, $6m raise

Do we really want to get the full Tav Health team back together again?

VP of Navigation or Ops - include us in more of the hiring decisions up front

12 months

Blended revenue per visit - have that empirically. $350 with a path to go higher

High visibility with ramp in 2nd market

Ruchita - They would love to do seed plus - good step up and value / credit.

TS in 2 weeks - George and Ruchita don’t work this week

Boxer - call Ruchita

Emre - call Corey
