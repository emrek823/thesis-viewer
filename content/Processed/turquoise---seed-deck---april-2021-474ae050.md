## Slide 3: Problem / Turquoise solution
**Problem**
Managed care & rev cycle is a zero sum game for patients.

1.  34% of US healthcare spending is on administration
2.  Current managed care contracting methods are not conducive to transparency

**Turquoise solution**
1.  Create basic economic forces by licensing transparent rates data
2.  Create SaaS platform that bundles care, simplifies reimbursement such that the data becomes actionable

| Category                   | Hospital Services               |
| :------------------------- | :------------------------------ |
| Inpatient Hospital Services | 70% of usual billed charges     |
| Outpatient Hospital Services | 70% of usual billed charges     |

3.  There are glaring market rate imbalances

**Result**
Lower priced care that's easier to pay for

## Slide 4: Vision
**Vision**
Become the source of truth for who owes what & who gets what in healthcare

Direct Contracting SaaS cleans the data

(Diagram: Circular flow with Patient, Provider, Payer. Provider interacts with Anesthesia, Surgeon, Facility. Money flows between Patient, Payer, Provider, and the sub-providers. "???" is between Patient and Provider/Payer interaction. "Interfaces Distribute the Data" flows into the Provider and Payer from external data sources.)

## Slide 5: State of Turquoise
**State of Turquoise**
Launched in November, 2020, but started writing code in 2019.
Our existing tech is valuable (backwards compatible) to rev cycle.

*   835 and 837 (claim/remittance) ingestion engines
*   Medicare claims pricers
*   White labelled price transparency compliance software
*   Consumer-facing comparison site
*   Payer/provider rates database & API

$12M acquisition offer after 3 months in business

**Gale force legislative tailwinds.**

*   1/1/21 Hospital Price Transparency
*   1/1/22 No Surprise Act, Transparency in Coverage (part 1)
*   1/1/23, 24: Transparency in Coverage (part 2)

## Slide 6: Turquoise Health's Noisy GTM
**Turquoise Health's Noisy GTM**
Data and consumer interface grabbed attention this winter

Patients Providers Payers Employers Revenue Cycle Sign Out
Compare prices before you get care.
Starting this year, all hospitals are required to list their prices for elective services. Whether you have insurance or plan to pay cash - find and compare prices below.

Turquoise Health is in Beta.
We are adding prices as quickly as hospitals are publishing them and we'll have more exciting news soon.
Sign up to hear first about everything we're launching!

**Why is our data a hot commodity?**
*   First mover advantage
*   Layered ML to create apples to apples comparisons
*   Public consumer facing play spurred hospital and payer attention

Can't build the business on data alone.
Can make it a recurring line item sold alongside our SaaS.

Posting 2000+ hospitals resulted in organic press & RCM lead gen: WSJ (x2), Fierce Healthcare, Philly Inquirer.
Generated a network effect on the value of the disclosed transparency data sooner than industry anticipated.

Hi Chris,

Really can't thank you enough for agreeing to step in on such short notice to make sure we are substantially compliant by January 1st. We greatly appreciate the efforts of you and your team, especially during the holiday time period.

We'll be in touch next week to begin some refinements to our file. We'll also check the completeness of the 835 and 837 files to verify that no payers are missing.

Thank you again, sincerely, for what you did for us.
