About Event

​**SVB, AlleyCorp, and LifeX present:**

## ​**The Future Health Workforce - Scaling Care in an AI-Native Era**

​We invite you to a focused JPM session on one of healthcare’s most pressing challenges: how to rebuild and scale the clinical workforce in an AI-native world.

​Hear from founders and operators who are redesigning care models, augmenting clinicians with AI, and tackling workforce shortages across primary care, behavioral health, and specialty services.

​Expect practical insights on what’s working, what’s not, and where the next decade of care delivery is headed. Join us for a morning of sharp conversation, networking, coffee, and breakfast — curated for innovators, clinicians, and investors shaping the future of healthcare.

​We’ll be joined by founders and operators from Altitude, Stepful, Assort Health, Sully, Doctronic, Trek Health, and AvoMD for a grounded discussion on how AI is actually reshaping healthcare delivery and clinical work.
