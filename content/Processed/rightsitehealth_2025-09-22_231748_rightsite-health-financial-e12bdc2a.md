## MD&A

Net revenue fell short of forecast because EMS call volume was lower than expected. Most of the miss came from Grady Dispatch.

To remediate the shortfall, we evaluated Grady's call data and found that they were only sending 1/3 of eligible dispatch calls. Once identified, Grady management launched new oversight and training in mid-September. In Fort Worth, we accelerated the stair-step expansion schedule of eligible codes.

September billings will include Molina (TX) retroactive case rates now that we are integrated with Molina's billing system.

Patient Care Expenses were slightly higher than forecast. The negative variance came from overstaffing physicians, driven by the initial overestimation of Fort Worth call volume. Patient Care Expenses should decrease during Q4 as we refine staffing schedules and initiate our nurse extender pilot, which increases Care Team throughput by offloading time-consuming tasks such as e-prescribing from physicians and navigators.

Adjusted SG&A ran slightly above forecast, driven by $153k in payroll accruals and $42k in legal fees tied to third-quarter terminations. Until case rate revenue and per-episode costs generate a positive gross margin, we have frozen hiring outside of the Care Team and Account Management.

# MD&A

**August Snapshot** - Call volume activations ended the month 20% below forecast, with Grady down 28%. Overall diversions were 29% below plan, driven by onboarding new ER physicians in August. New physicians face a learning curve in diverting patients to telehealth. Our updated onboarding program is shortening that curve, and by mid-September, diversion rates improved 17%.

**September Snapshot** - To strengthen EMS "same store growth,” we adopted a hunter-farmer model that separates new EMS sales from account management. We also now evaluate EMS-side call data in addition to RightSite data. Together, these steps are designed to improve call volume generation.

*   **Georgia** - Grady leadership mandated 30 dispatch calls per day. By mid-September, volume rose 30%. We are extending this process across all dispatch programs. Atlanta MSA coverage expanded with four new contracts (Forest Park, Smyrna, Fayette County). East Point, College Park, Gwinnett, and Cherokee remain in contracting, targeting Q4 launches.
*   **Texas** - Fort Worth Fire went live August 19, with a projected climb to 25+ activations per day. The forecast was too high, leading to Care Team overstaffing. We accelerated eligible code expansion, and volume is rising. Harris County and Bell County are scheduled to go live in November and Williamson, Midland, New Braunfels, and Garland contracts are pending.
*   **Florida** - Jacksonville Fire expanded dispatch eligibility, but city-level politics limit growth. We are selling into Gainesville, Orlando, Palm Beach, and Tallahassee for Q4 contracts. Georgia and Texas remain the priority to capture case rate economics.

## MD&A

*   Cash ended at $14.5M, a slight negative variance of $38k.

*   Net Revenue was $55k, a negative variance of $105k, driven by:
    *   lower activation/diversion volume
    *   new physicians missing credentialing
    *   delayed case rate contracting
*   Out of period (“OOP”) reconciliation (previous VA claims + HUM case rate review) reduced net revenue by $15.5k. Excluding this, Net Revenue would have been $70.5k

*   Net Revenue / Episode was $63, a negative variance of $84. Excluding the OOP reductions, Net Revenue / Episode would have been $80

*   Patient Care Cost / Episode was a negative variance of $75, driven by physician overstaffing in anticipation of higher call volume from Ft Worth EMS

*   Without the activation volume miss, Patient Care Cost / Episode would have been $285 compared to the $278 target
