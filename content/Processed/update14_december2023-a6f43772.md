Dear Solstice Shareholders:

## Last month's focus:

1.  **Sign a paid partnership with New Mexico Cancer Center.**
    We did not achieve this goal. Dr. McAneny, the CEO of NMCC, decided not to move forward with Solstice. She said they're going to continue with their current process of records retrieval and didn't see value in "having another fax in the middle" which shows that there seems to be a misunderstanding in the value.

    Our takeaways: Given her feedback, we don't think any price point would have converted them. She only saw Solstice helping with retrieving records from health systems they otherwise wouldn't have been able to reach, hence not replacing their entire workflow. We clearly didn't do a good job of articulating our value proposition.

    How we are going to adjust based on this feedback
    i.  Short-term: Our ROI needs to be more clearly defined. Our current value proposition is based on time savings to the practice. Financially, this means for practices with multiple individuals handling retrieval, they can cut down on staff and for clinics like New Mexico with only one individual, that individual can handle higher value tasks that = greater revenue. In our final sales call post-pilot, we need to quantify this for them so the CEO/clinic manager better understands why they should purchase Solstice.
    ii. Long-term: Our current value proposition of cost/time savings is not sufficient for our platform to be a no-brainer for most practices. We need to help them generate additional revenue. More on that below.

2.  **Initiate a trial with Rocky Mountain Cancer Centers.**
    We did not achieve this goal. The manager is ready to move forward but is still waiting on compliance go-ahead, she bumped them last week so we are hopeful we can get things moving this week. In the future, we will embed the BAA into our terms of service in hopes of expediting pilot kick-off in situations like this.

3.  **Fully automate data structuring from HIEs by resolving issues from outliers.**
    We achieved this goal. We can now process all health systems from Oregon without problem. We did right some custom logic for this with certain health systems hardcoded. In the future this needs to be more scalable and we are looking into ways to assign outlier documents into one of multiple processing pipelines based on the underlying structure of the data as opposed to the facility name from which it is coming.

4.  **Implement improved automated fax feature.**
    We achieved this goal. Automated faxes are now based on referrals indicated in progress notes as opposed to the Record Locator Service from HIEs. Still imperfect in some cases but overall works effectively.

5.  **Have 5 promising candidates for founding engineer hire in the pipeline.**
    We did not achieve this goal. We have one promising candidate that we've had a few working sessions with. Given some of the questions related to value proposition, we'd prefer to iron out our sales motion and truly be constrained by our development capabilities before onboarding another person and so are going to hold off on this for the time being. We are not in a rush to hire at this moment.

## Updates:

### 1. Customers

#### a. Oregon Specialty Group
i. Data processing is entirely automated except for a few outliers where there are one-off issues.
ii. Usage has been great (~50 patients/week) and 20 individuals across their clinics are logging in to Solstice and requesting or downloading reports.
iii. We are actively looking to get feedback from users to understand why usage has been sticky here compared to clinics like New Mexico. We are also setting up a time with Traci, the clinic manager to both get her testimonial for future prospects and also to get some additional data so we can better quantify our ROI.

### 2. Pilots

#### a. Alabama Oncology
i. We kicked off an official pilot with Alabama with approval from the CEO last week (previously only working with a doctor there) and onboarded the admin staff onto the platform.
ii. The CEO asked for a month-long trial which we agreed to (in the future, we won't agree to this) and have check-ins with the admin staff weekly where we have them make all of their requests for the clinic at once. More updates on the pilot to follow.

### 3. Future Pipeline

#### a. We now have bandwidth to handle additional clinic capacity and have started additional outreach, both to warm relationships we already have established and new ones.
i. Warm relationships: We reached back out to Astera Cancer Care, West Cancer Center, and Mary Bird Perkins, all of which we have spoken to in the past and have expressed interest.
ii. New outreach: We've also started additional email outbound to clinics across Oregon.

### 4. Product

#### a. We can now handle all outlier health systems in Oregon thanks to custom processing we built for these systems.
#### b. The automated fax feature is now also built out and works for the majority of patients.
#### c. We built out a new request feature that allows users to upload a patient intake form instead of requiring them to manually input patient information due to feedback we received from Alabama. We are testing and if it goes well, we will roll out the other clinics we are working with.

### 5. Future Direction:

#### a. We are actively looking for ways to help clinics generate additional revenue through the more comprehensive data we are able to get on their patients which we believe would help us bolster our value proposition.
#### b. We're exploring a few things here, the strongest so far is to help providers in value-based contracts get higher risk-adjustments for patients given the more extensive prior medical history we are able to retrieve. We are doing a case-study with Maryland using retrospective data in their EMR to determine if this hypothesis is accurate and will then begin outreach to providers participating in relevant value-based programs.

## This Month's Focus:

1.  Begin a pilot/trial with at-least two of Rocky Mountain, Astera, West Clinic, Marybird Perkins, or another clinic in our pipeline.
2.  Satisfy Alabama's admin staff during the pilot and get go-ahead from CEO to implement across the practice through a paid contract.
3.  Have at least 6 additional sales calls with new clinics for core record retrieval products.
4.  Complete risk adjustment case study with Maryland and have at least 5 calls trying to pitch the risk adjustment offering to new provider organizations.
