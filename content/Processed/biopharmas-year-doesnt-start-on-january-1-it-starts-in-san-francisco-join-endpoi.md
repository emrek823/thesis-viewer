COWORKING SPACE

THE CONVERSATION

Each new biopharma year doesn’t start on January 1 — it kicks off a few weeks later when leaders gather in San Francisco. The annual JPM event sets the tone for a year of dealmaking, and in 2026, leaders will make sense of the industry’s instability and set the course forward.

Endpoints journalists will join industry leaders on stage, pushing for real answers that cut through the usual talking points. We’ll focus on the systemic forces that are reshaping the industry, including China’s emerging role in innovation, regulatory shifts under the new administration, and the volatile market environment.

And the Endpoints Hub will give you a place to step back from the frenzy — space for meetings, perspective, and connection.

PEOPLE

Real people, real conversations, real answers — get the full story from leaders on where we go from here.

PROGRAMMING

Candid discussions about what actually works when funding plateaus and barriers keep rising.

PLACE

The Endpoints Hub, a coworking space that offers sanctuary to meet, focus, and connect in the midst of the JPM frenzy.

SPONSORS

AGENDA AT-A-GLANCE

Our programming will decode the big questions facing biopharma in 2026. We’ll explore the intersection of business, science and policy at a moment of systemic reset.

Between sessions, the Hub is where you can connect with peers, grab a bite and put the day’s conversations into context.

Virtual programming will run from 8:00 AM - 12:00 PM PST each day.
