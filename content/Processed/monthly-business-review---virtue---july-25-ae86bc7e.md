# Slide 6: July - Customer conversation updates Overview: 34 customer/prospect convos logged

## July - Customer conversation updates
Overview: 34 customer/prospect convos logged

### Highlights
1.  Strong appetite for a single, AI-driven "control-tower" that delivers real-time visibility, automated alerts/calls and temperature intelligence: Kite Pharma, Pfizer (EMEA), Verily, Henry Ford Health, AIT Worldwide, Cardinal Health, AxmedRx
2.  White-label/co-branding interest among diagnostics & CRO segment: CovarsaDx/ZoaDx (ADML), Global BioClinical (ADML), CAP (ADML), Cardinal Health
3.  Pipeline momentum: Ajinomoto (3-month free pilot), Cardinal Health (Oct 1 pilot), Verily (pilot priced & under security review), Generate Bio (free high-value shipment + Oct target), Ember Life Sciences (pilot under discussion).

### Lowlights
1.  ROI & price sensitivity in low-volume research / donor-funded environments: Ajinomoto, Gates Foundation/UNFPA, MRN Diagnostics (ADML), Raheel Biosciences (ADML), TrippBio
2.  Integration, security & resource-capacity concerns slow buying cycles: Kite Pharma, Verily (security review), Cardinal Health (IT assessment), YNHH (Capstone courier API), AIT Worldwide (CargoWise), Labcorp (decision authority))
3.  Data quality & baseline-metric gaps make value quantification hard: Verily (no baseline loss data), Hospital systems (messy inbound data - Erich Heneke), Abbott (emerging-market SKU gaps), Pierre (specimen-level granularity))

### Key quotes
*   **Verily**: "Man, think about that dashboard— I could just go in and check where everything is."
    *   -Ali Merrick, Program Manager. Crystallises the core value proposition (single-pane visibility) in a single sentence; becomes useful copy for sales decks and demos.
*   **Pfizer (EMEA)**: "I was kinda thinking, — this is what I thought logistics would look like when I came out of university." — Tomas Fant, EMEA Logistics. Signals that seasoned logistics leaders see ZoomLogi as the long-awaited modernisation of their workflows—a powerful proof-point for other pharma prospects.
*   **TPG Capital**: "That price could look very inexpensive for a CAR-T therapy ... I can see the case for the ROI there." - Katherine Wood, Partner. External investor validation that the pricing model is compelling for ultra-high-value therapies; bolsters confidence in enterprise-tier pricing strategy.

**Call transcript:**
*   **Hello?**
*   **Hi Rob, this is Mia from ZoomLogi. I'm calling today about a shipment with ID SHIP 67890.**
*   **Do you have any other reference numbers?**
*   **Sure, the tracking ID for this shipment is 1212345E1512345676. Does that help?**
*   **Yeah. That's me. I'm the driver.**
*   **Are you currently the driver for this delivery?**
*   **Thanks for confirming, Rob. So, I'm seeing is that our system has detected a battery alert for shipment SHIP 67890. This means the sensor battery is below 90% while the shipment is still at origin. Do you understand so far?**
*   **Got it. I've fixed it.**
*   **Great. What we need you to do is recharge or swap the battery before completing the pickup.**
*   **AI assistant could not resolve the issue**
*   **Unable to resolve alert due to resolution window expiring. Manual review required.**
