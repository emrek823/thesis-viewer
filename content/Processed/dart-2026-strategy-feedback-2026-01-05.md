# Dart Health 2026 Strategy Feedback

From: Virtue (Sean & Emre)
Date: January 5, 2026
Re: 2026 Planning Memo - Strategic Positioning Review

## Email to Send

Strong 2025 execution (profitability, 5x revenue growth, Kelly hire, CHAP). These questions are about sharpening the 2026 story and plan.

### 1. What is Dart, really? Sharpen the positioning.

The memo describes workflows, assistants, AI infrastructure, and AI Data Analyst — but a clear one-liner is missing. When a health system CEO asks "what do you do?", what's the answer? The best companies we work with can explain it in one sentence that a buyer immediately understands.

### 2. What's actually built vs. what's roadmap?

You reference 50+ use cases, patient graphs, fine-tuned embeddings, and judge-model loops. We'd love to understand: what's production-grade infrastructure today vs. still being built out? What scale has it processed (patient records, analyses, rules in the system)? Quantifying this helps us tell the story to co-investors and differentiates you from "wrapper" competitors.

### 3. What have you proven, and what's still hypothesis?

Post-acute QA is proven: customers pay, renew, expand. Kelly's network activates pipeline. But hospital sales, AI Data Analyst as wedge, and $300K ACVs are still hypotheses. Naming what's validated vs. what you're testing helps us align on where to focus support — and makes the fundraise story cleaner.

### 4. Why do customers pick Dart over alternatives?

You've won against Brellium and Charta. What do customers say is the reason? Is it speed (48-hour deployment), accuracy (fine-tuned models), flexibility (custom rules), or relationship (boots on ground)? The answer shapes GTM messaging and helps us know what to emphasize in intros.

### 5. How has the commercial strategy evolved, and what's the current motion?

The hospital wedge has shifted: platform → oncology co-pilot → AI Data Analyst. That iteration is healthy, but walk us through the learning. What did oncology conversations teach you? Why is Data Analyst the better entry point? Understanding this helps us pattern-match on intros.

### 6. Pipeline confidence: what converts and what slips?

$6.7M pipeline against a $10M goal. What's your historical stage-to-close conversion? The August hospital targets (Advent, Mayo, ECU) aren't in the December pipeline — what happened? How qualified is Kelly's $3.5M? We want to help you hit the number, which means understanding where deals actually are.

### 7. Right to win in health systems — what's the proof point?

Post-acute credibility is established. Hospitals are a different buyer, longer cycle, different integration. What gives Dart the right to win there vs. Health Catalyst, Innovaccer, or Epic adding this themselves? One or two early hospital wins with clear ROI would answer this — what's the path to those logos in H1?

### 8. Team buildout: how do we get there?

The memo lists Head of Commercial, Head of Eng, Head of Delivery — but "putting together profiles" in December means Q2 starts at best. Other portfolio companies at your stage ([[Solstice Health|Solstice]], Integral) brought in experienced operators earlier to unlock scale. What's the realistic timeline? Do you need recruiter intros? What's the financing plan if you want to accelerate hiring ahead of revenue?

## SD Context

### 1. Two-Front War Risk

You're targeting post-acute ($5M) and hospitals (15 @ $300K) simultaneously. These are fundamentally different:

**Post-Acute:**
- Buyer: Ops/Quality directors
- Sales cycle: 30-90 days
- Product need: QA workflows
- Context transferability: High (CHAP standards universal)

**Hospitals:**
- Buyer: CMO/CNO/CIO committees
- Sales cycle: 6-18 months
- Product need: Varies wildly (discharge, nutrition, triage)
- Context transferability: Low (each system is different)

**Risk:** You're building two separate context moats, two sales motions, two product surfaces - with 10 FTEs.

**Strategic question to resolve:** Is the hospital play a 2026 priority, or a 2027 setup? If Kelly's post-acute book can get you to $5M, do you need the hospital distraction this year?

### 2. CHAP is Underexploited

You have the accreditor for 5,000+ agencies as a customer. This is a distribution cheat code that isn't reflected in your strategy.

**What CHAP enables:**
- Co-marketing: "DART powers CHAP surveys" → instant credibility
- Warm intros: CHAP knows every compliance officer at every agency
- Data advantage: CHAP sees audit patterns across the entire industry

**Strategic gap:** The memo treats CHAP as a $375K contract. It should be treated as a channel partnership with a dedicated owner and explicit co-selling targets.

**Recommendation:** Negotiate co-marketing rights + referral structure into the CHAP contract. Target: 20+ warm intros to agencies via CHAP in 2026.

### 3. Hospital Wedge is Undifferentiated

Current approach: "Serving them with the AI data analyst product as a wedge"

Hospital BI/analytics is crowded (Health Catalyst, Arcadia, dozens of others). Your differentiation is clinical workflow context - but "AI data analyst" doesn't leverage that.

**Better wedge candidates:**
- Discharge planning (already in John Muir pipeline) - high pain, cross-departmental, context-heavy
- Quality/compliance (your core strength) - transfers from post-acute positioning
- Care transitions (HH→Hospice, post-acute→home) - no one owns this gap

**Strategic question:** Why lead with analytics when your moat is workflow execution? Consider flipping: lead with a specific workflow (discharge), use analytics as the upsell.

### 4. Context Moat Needs Measurement

You correctly identify context as the moat: "Most clinical <> operation rules aren't written anywhere"

But there's no system to measure or compound it. Questions:
- How many rules/decision trees have you codified?
- What % of new deployments reuse existing context vs. build new?
- How do you transfer learning from post-acute to hospitals (or do they share nothing)?

**Recommendation:** Create an internal "Context Index" - track rules, reuse rate, and time-to-deploy by customer segment. This becomes your internal north star and eventually an external differentiation claim.

### 5. Head of Commercial Timing

You want: "Head of Commercial: Managed growth from $XM - $XXXM Healthcare specific"

At $2M ARR with an evolving product (AI Data Analyst is new, hospital motion is unproven), a big-company sales leader may:
- Push for premature standardization
- Struggle with founder-led selling handoff
- Expect infrastructure you don't have

**Alternative:** Hire a VP of Sales ($200-300K OTE) who's done $2M→$10M, not $10M→$100M. Save the CRO hire for 2027 when you have repeatable motion.

Kelly already activating $2M+ pipeline in 48 hours suggests founder-led + Kelly might be enough for 2026.

### 6. Acquisition Thesis Needs Criteria

Current: "Great Consolidation coming in 2026-2027... acquire teams & technology"

This is strategically sound but needs guardrails to avoid distraction.

**Acquisition criteria to define now:**
- Acqui-hires: Engineering teams from failed AI health startups. Target: <$500K, 3-5 engineers, production AI experience.
- Tuck-ins: Point solutions with <$500K ARR but deep context in specific workflows (e.g., prior auth, care coordination).
- Avoid: Anything requiring sales integration or new GTM motion.

**Recommendation:** Build a watchlist of 10-15 companies to track. Know their funding status, burn rate, and key employees. When they struggle, move fast.

### 7. Missing: Competitive Response Plan

The memo doesn't address what happens when:
- Epic adds AI workflows to their platform
- Microsoft/Nuance pushes DAX deeper into operations
- Well-funded startups (Abridge, Regard) expand into your space

**Strategic questions to answer:**
- What's your response if Epic ships "AI Quality Workflows" in 2026?
- At what point does a competitor threat change your roadmap?
- What's defensible even against a well-funded fast-follower?

### 8. NRR Should Be a Primary Metric

You mention: "Expanding use cases (NRR) within the year (+20-50% in ACV)"

But NRR isn't tracked as a primary metric. At your stage, NRR > new logo count for proving PMF.
