## Slide 4: AI in healthcare is growing exponentially and is beginning to transform clinical practice

# AI in healthcare is growing exponentially and is
# beginning to transform clinical practice

**Massive Investments**
"Healthcare AI companies brought in
**$2.5 billion in 1Q2021"**
(Fierce Healthcare, April 2021)

**Products Going To Market**
AI SaMD FDA clearances crossed **>100** /
year; **5-year CAGR of 150%**
But... **time to market is still slow**
(measured in years)

**Numerous AI Cos**
**>500 'AI-first'** digital health cos
**>70% of traditional** healthcare cos
with big investments in AI

**Market Penetration**
30% of radiologists report the regular
use of AI, but complain about
But... **'inconsistent performance'**
(ACR DSI Radiologist AI Survey 2020)

## Slide 5: Barriers in healthcare slow down adoption of AI, Federated Learning solves them

# Barriers in healthcare slow down adoption
# of AI, Federated Learning solves them

**Current State**
Regulation limits data sharing
Data siloed in 'on prem' IT, impedes
validation and deployment
Fear of misuse limits collaboration
Aggregating data is costly, limited
and introduces bias

**With Federated Learning**
Data isn't shared: access to sensitive
data becomes low-risk
Access on-prem data for rapid testing,
refining and deploying products
Hospitals retain control, fostering
participation
Customers access data directly and
unlock data insights

**...To Accelerate Innovation & Make AI**
**Work 'In the Real World'**

*   Cerebral aneurysms occur in 6% of the
    population but hard to detect
*   A detection model from MGH was made
    generalizable, using a global data set
*   A scalable network (already **7 sites**) was
    formed and will continue to expand
*   A diverse data set of thousands of cases is
    now accessible

## Slide 11: The pricing model is tiered subscription, optimized for growth and ensures value capture

# The pricing model is tiered subscription,
# optimized for growth and ensures value capture

**For hospitals**

**Peer-to-Peer Solution (NPOs)**
*   $25-50k yearly subscription.
*   Secondary value from access to
    curated and annotated data-sets.
*   Generates a strong network effect.

**'Data Strategy' (incl. industry)**
*   $50k yearly subscription.
*   In addition, we charge industry
    collaborators per 'data silo'.

**For industry**

**Enterprise (Direct)**
*   $150k/year entry level (3 'data silos'),
    scales to $1m+ for full enterprise.
*   Long term by definition (need to keep
    subscription to maintain data access).

**Enterprise (Channel Partnerships)**
*   Rev-share on end-customer subscriptions
    ($150k+ / year per end-customer).
*   Allows to penetrate conservative
    industries (e.g., biopharma).

# Federated Learning (FL) is a
# technology that allows to bridge

(Diagram showing four client sites (A, B, C, D) connected to a Federated Model, which then connects to a Server (Cloud))

*   **Site A**
*   **Site B**
*   **Site C**
*   **Site D**

(Data flow illustration)
Client (Model Parameters (No Patient Data)) -> Federated Model (1010101010...) -> Server (Cloud)

**No data transferred between clients**
**and server**

**...breaking barriers, by not**
**requiring stakeholder to**
**share data**

1.  Compute done locally **'on the**
    **edge'**
2.  Model parameters are
    transferred
3.  Server 'blends' parameters,
    **mitigates local data bias**
4.  Result: **'master model'** using
    **diverse data** from multiple
    clients
