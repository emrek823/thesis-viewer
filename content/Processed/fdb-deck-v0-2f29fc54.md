Bring AI Securely Into Healthcare Operations

Sayem Hoque, Founder & CEO

December 2024

Healthcare Administration Market 265B Spend

Human Driven

Automatable

McKinsey estimates 265B annual spend on healthcare administration and growing yearly.

Payor & Provider Operations

These operations in healthcare include eligibility, intake, scheduling, denials management, prior authorizations, communications, and more.

AI Agents

AI Agents are now able to do more of these operations than ever before, but they need to be integrated, and able to learn at scale from each other to collaborate with humans.

AI Agents that do real work for teams

Email Operations Agent

Automatically read, sort, and

respond to emails, extracting

relevant data and triggering

workflows such as claims

submissions, customer inquiries, or

appointment scheduling.

Robotic Process Automation

Agent

Bots to perform repetitive tasks

like data entry, eligibility, prior

auth flows mimicking human

actions across multiple digital

systems.

Document Processing Agent Extraction, classification, and validation of data from forms, invoices, and contracts, reducing manual entry and speeding up record management.

AI Call Agent

Automate payor communications like prior authorizations, eligibility checks, and claims updates, reducing manual calls, wait times, and administrative burdens.

What happens once AI Agents become pervasive?

Other AI Agents for phone, email, fax,

RPA, and more operations are often

custom built for organizations, creating

their own silos.

AI Agents cannot just replace

existing workflows, they need to

be connected to the AI-native

data platform for that connects

across these modes.

Flexbone Data Platform

Native to Custom AI Agents

Create Insights for Partner

AI Agents will augment and Organizations

replace existing workflows, but the data needs to feed live into a larger unified store.

Connects Across Operations Enables collaboration within organizations that operate and create their own silos

currently.

Once data is integrated across an org, Flexbone can enable new workflows
