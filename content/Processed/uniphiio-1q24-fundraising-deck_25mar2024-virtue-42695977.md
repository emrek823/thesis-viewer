Clinical Trial Technology Market

The Market Opportunity
“A starving person will eat spoiled food. When selecting our clinical trial technology vendors, we feel like we’re forced to select the best of the worst – there are no good options”

Time & Money​
Each day can cost sponsors $600k-8MM​
​
​
Compliance & Data Quality​
Noncompliance or poor data quality can mean $Billions in losses​
​
​
Patient Recruitment & Clinical Site Burden​
Complex systems increase burden and slow enrollment. 30%+ of clinical trials fail to meet enrollment targets.​
​

What are sponsors worried about?

## Slide 6

Multiple Systems Complicate Trials

More systems to buy

More systems to deploy

More systems to support

More systems to use

More data to coordinate

Increased Cost

Longer Trials

Increased Noncompliance

Reduced Data Quality

Furious End-Users

Unnecessary Spending

80% of data scientists’ time is wasted from assembling data from multiple systems, versus 20% of actual analysis1

## Slide 7

Trial collaborators must perfectly retain and apply thousands of regulations and rules to avoid costly deviations and errors 

The volume of rules and regulations is increasing as trials become more complex

Present technology doesn’t help collaborators remain compliant, resulting in significant errors

Multiple systems are not the only issue

7

---

## Slide 8

Deviations Pose Huge Risks for Sponsors

GCP Violations caused invalid data in 358 of the 439 enrolled patients 

Because multiple systems are used, violations were only detected after data was compiled

The average PIII Alzheimer’s trial is $350MM

BioVie likely jeopardized >$1B across the program as a result

GCP Violations caused data from 9,000 patients to be discarded

Pfizer was conducting the trial in partnership with Valneva

Valneva’s stock has plummeted 26% since the incident

https://www.clinicaltrialsarena.com/news/biovie-reports-protocol-deviations-in-phase-iii-alzheimers-trial/?cf-view

Protocol deviations occur in ~25% of clinical trials

BioVie reports protocol deviations in Phase III Alzheimer's trial

## Slide 10

Our first-of-its-kind Intelligent Workflow Management solution guides each user through every step of researchThis is made possible by our proprietary, dynamic rules engineOur solution significantly reduces protocol deviations, improving compliance & data quality while speeding up trials

Automating ‘what to do next’ for end-users

## Slide 11

Why Software Rules Engines Matter

Old GPS Technology - Fixed Rules Engines

Modern GPS Technology – Dynamic Rules Engines

Innovation

Knows only fixed variables, not data
Expanding variables is costly & slow

Our proprietary dynamic rules engine will revolutionize the clinical trial industry, similar to the advancement of the GPS Industry

Knows all data, and variables can be assigned instantly
Expanding variables is fast & without cost

## Slide 13

Product Status

Our platform has been proven through 3 years of U.S Government Covid-19 Trials

Our platform is in Production, and the underlying structure (i.e., QMS) is now ready to serve additional customers

Ongoing investment in Role experience & improved scalability is planned

UNIPHI.io can deploy a superior product in 50%+ less time, and we’re only getting better

## Slide 14

Go-to-Market: Attacking Early Phase Trials

By capturing the Phase 1 Market, we’re going to displace our competition by becoming the sponsor’s early partner before our competition has a chance to get an RFP

Our competition supports Phase 2 & 3 trials – their solutions cannot be deployed fast enough and at a low enough price point to meet Phase 1 trial demands. 

Sponsors avoid changing vendors through study phase – it complicates data analysis and reduces efficiency

Total Trial Count (Avg): 9,331
Phase 1 (avg) : 3,545

45% of the Trials are presently unserved

## Slide 15

Our Major 2024 Phase I Opportunity

A top-10 Pharma company has approached UNIPHI.io for a solution to support their Phase 1 portfolio (20+ trials per year)

Our Competitors Bid: 
	Three separate systems taking 10 weeks to deliver, 	costing >$800k

Our Solution:
	A single platform taking <3 weeks to deploy for 	50%  less than our competition

UNIPHI.io is the only vendor who can meet the sponsors needs within the necessary timeframe and budget

15

## Slide 16

Go-to-Market – Customer/Phase Expansion

Sponsors aim to avoid switching vendors throughout an asset's development
Once capturing a Phase I trial, each win is a seed planted to grow into multiple downstream larger projects

ACV by Phase of Development

Contracts are written per-trial. Pricing Model is a mix of licenses, software configuration & services.
 
Advantageous Cash Flow: ~50% of revenue is recognized in first 3 months of work - remainder is burned linearly over the duration of the trial

## Slide 17

Intelligent Workflow Management : How we grow beyond the $10.8B Market

The $64B CRO market largely comprises manual human effort services to manage clinical trials

We will capture a portion of that market through automating those services with our Intelligent Workflow Management Solution

Manual human effort services can represent >80% of a trial budget, roughly 8x technology spend
