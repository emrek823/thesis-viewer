## Slide 1: Title Slide
# Slope
Data-driven clinical trial supply chain management.
Rust Felix · Co-Founder & CEO
(251) 300 - 7390 · rust@slope.io

## Slide 2: The Problem
Trial Sponsors lose hundreds of millions of dollars because their supply chains are too complex for people to manage.

**Trial Vendors**
Drug, device, kit, and supply distribution is reactive.

**Research Sites**
No systems exist to help sites manage inventory & orders.

**Study Patients**
There's no easy way to forecast patient inventory requirements.

**Analytical Labs**
Ensuring samples end up at the right labs requires lots of PM.

? Questionable Clinical Data
94% of clinical trials are delayed more than a month. Delays cost $600K to $8M per day.

## Slide 3: Our Solution
So we built the first connected clinical supply chain management platform that ensures everyone knows where everything is.

**Before Slope: Inaccurate forecasts cause study delays.**
* Sponsors, CROs, and Vendors don't have visibility into clinical inventory usage at trial sites.
* So spreadsheet models and simulations are relied on for both demand forecasting and PM.
* Site demand isn't balanced with vendor supply. Patients are impacted & studies are delayed.

**With Slope: Data powers supply chain automation.**
* Sites use Slope to manage their inventory, ensuring they have what they need for trial patients.
* ClinOps teams are connected to this data in real-time. Site data powers resupply automation.
* Vendors improve distribution accuracy with better inventory mgmt. and resupply workflows.

## Slide 4: Traction, Feedback, & Analytics

### WHERE WE ARE TODAY:
* $2.6M TCV of clinical trials launched Q4 2019.
* $4M+ TCV of trials launching in 2020.
* ~$9M TCV in deployments scheduled for next 18-24 mo.
* 7 paid clinical trials with channel partners.
* 875 clinical stakeholders using our platform.

### FEEDBACK FROM PLATFORM USERS:
"I am super impressed by Slope – they are focused on all of the right things. Slope is dedicated to sites and making their job easier."
– Gabe Garcia / Clinical Research Coordinator, New England Cancer Specialists

"Slope has significantly reduced our inventory burden and has made our studies much easier to conduct."
– Karen Arrington / VP, Clinical Operations, Cancer Insight

"Slope has been a critical partner in Andwin's pipeline growth and success. Their unique technology advantage helps me close faster."
– Andrew Billimore / VP, Commercial Ops, Andwin Scientific

### ANALYTICS
*   **135K+** Clinical Inventory & Assets Managed
*   **2.1K+** Clinical Trials Managed On our Platform
*   **276** Research Sites Using Our Platform
*   **33%** Oncology Focused Clinical Trials

## Slide 6: Target Market

### Market Size Data:
*   **$19.1B** Total Addressable Market
    *   Global trial supplies and logistics market size from recent Visiongain report.
*   **$5.5B** Serviceable Addressable Market
    *   29% of active clinical trials are operationally intensive oncology studies (~25k trial count).
*   **$28M** Serviceable Obtainable Market
    *   Established competitors leave us with 5% of oncology trials. Good timing and early adopter focus nets us 10% of this segment in near term.

### IDEAL CUSTOMER PERSONAS:

**Oncology Therapeutics / Diagnostics Trial Sponsors**
We directly target small & medium sized, well-funded oncology therapeutics / diagnostics Sponsors who prefer minimal CRO involvement. Their studies will have heavy inventory and biosample management needs.

**Large CROs and BioPharma Trial Sponsors**
Slope's Vendor channel partners leverage existing procurement contracts with larger organizations for portfolio-driven co-sale opportunities. Tremendous amount of deal flow and high win rates.

## Slide 7: Competitive Landscape
Slope's site-centric data collection model and focus on more than just drugs sets us apart.
