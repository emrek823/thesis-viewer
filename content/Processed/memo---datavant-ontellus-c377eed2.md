# Mem Datavant's Acquisition of Ontellus

## Overview
Datavant is set to acquire Ontellus, a prominent vendor in insurance and legal medical record retrieval. This acquisition expands Datavant's reach into direct record retrieval markets, including life insurance and legal sectors. It is estimated that Datavant paid between $1B to $1.5B for Ontellus. This acquisition expands Datavant's market position, turning itself into a vertically integrated company controlling both release-of-information (ROI) and direct record retrieval channels.

This industry realignment creates an immediate and substantial opportunity for Hermes Health, positioning us uniquely to capitalize on the need for a neutral middle platform for identified health data exchange.

## The Response

### Record Retrieval Companies
Currently, around 100 record retrieval firms compete in the market, with Ontellus ranked approximately as the 10th largest.

Approximately 90% of their workflow is still manual, with offshore labor handling most of the operations. Technology is minimal, often limited to a basic portal for submitting and delivering requests. Vendors compete on thin margins, with little differentiation beyond price and responsiveness. Due to the lack of differentiation and technological investment, the space is heavily commoditized. As a result although customer demand is high most attorneys and payors are frustrated by slow turnaround times and inconsistent service.

This acquisition significantly impacts these firms by transforming Datavant, already the largest release-of-information (ROI) vendor with a 20% market share, into a direct competitor. This has created major concerns:

*   **Neutrality:** Datavant was previously viewed as a neutral data exchange platform. With Ontellus, it now directly competes against firms it once served. This eroding trust and will push firms toward independent, neutral alternatives.
*   **Subsidized Site Fees:** Datavant could preferentially subsidize Ontellus's site fees, disadvantaged independent retrieval companies in pricing competition.
*   **Restricted API Access:** Competitors fear Datavant may restrict or revoke critical API access, limiting their ability to service clients.
*   **Degraded Turnaround Times:** Datavant-controlled sites could slow processing of competitor requests, negatively affecting competitors' turnaround times.
*   **Technology Investment:** Datavant intends to heavily automate Ontellus's manual operations, potentially undercutting the cost structures of independent retrieval vendors unable to match such investments.

These pressures are expected to accelerate market consolidation, encouraging smaller companies to merge, and force record retrieval companies to make substantial technology investments to compete in this new world.

### ROI Vendors
Datavant's acquisition of Ontellus significantly impacts ROI vendors. Previously, Ontellus was positioned as the neutral API for relationships with ROI companies, streamlining record exchanges without competitive friction. Now, as Datavant owns both Ciox and Ontellus, independent ROI vendors face severe competitive vulnerabilities:

*   Exposure of sensitive metadata (customer lists, pricing structures, and turnaround times) from the Ontellus API.
*   Loss of a neutral technology partner and potential diversion of traffic to Datavant-owned services.

Thus, Ontellus has lost its neutral stance, aligning with Datavant's strategic preference itself as the preferred ROI vendor and method of retrieving recors.

## The Opportunity
The erosion of Datavant's and Ontellus neutrality presents a once in a lifetime opportunity.

Hermes Health plans to seize the moment and step into this emerging vacuum, becoming the trusted platform for independent players looking for technological parity, and a neutral data exchange platform.

As a result, Hermes Healths is exploring shifting its end-users (law firms and insurance companies) to the record retrieval companies and analytics companies.
