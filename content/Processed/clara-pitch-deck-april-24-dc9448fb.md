## Slide 1: Let's transform independent home care for seniors

Let's transform independent
home care for seniors

CLARA

## Slide 2: Our Mission

CLARA

### OUR MISSION
Help Americans age in peace and
dignity by reimagining home care

### FOR CONSUMERS
Deliver easy access to the highest quality,
most affordable home care for seniors

### FOR CARE PROFESSIONALS
Transform home care into a sustainable,
satisfying, and rewarding career

## Slide 3: America's need for home care is large and growing quickly

### WHY NOW?
America's need for home care is large and growing quickly

**Americans are living longer than ever**
**but are not healthier than ever**

*   80% of seniors have at least one chronic condition
*   ~20 million Americans require assistance
    completing self-care and other daily tasks
*   69% of the U.S. population will require long term
    care services for an avg of ~3 years

**Aging at home is more popular & more**
**affordable than alternatives**

*   >75% of Americans 50+ want to remain in
    their homes as they age
*   home care is ~50% less expensive than
    equivalent full-time in-patient care facilities

## Slide 4: Today's home care system is incapable of meeting rising demand

### WHY NOW?
Today's home care system is incapable of meeting rising demand

**Demand for professional home care is skyrocketing**

*   >1M new home care jobs created (+46%) by 2029.
    Largest single occupation growth in U.S.
*   > 2nd + 3rd largest growth occupations combined
*   Industry expected to grow 7-8% CAGR

[America's long-term care system is]
"Chronically under-funded,
siloed, and otherwise
dysfunctional”
- PHI National "Caring for the future 2021"

**Yet the existing care ecosystem is**
**fragmented, antiquated and inefficient**

*   >65K agencies
*   75% have < 50 employees. 90% have < 100
*   Most still run on pen & paper
*   Agency careworker turnover: 70-80%/year

## Slide 5: Consumers have three poor options

### PROBLEM
Consumers have three poor options
When seeking high-quality, reliable and affordable home care

*   **60% Hire an agency**
    Pay taxes + fees
*   **25% Hire independently**
    Pay off-the-books
*   **15% Hire independently**
    Pay on the books

**No solution offers the ease of**
**an agency, paired with the**
**control and affordability of**
**hiring independently**

**Expensive**
Avg. cost of care $30/hr

**Disempowers consumers**
Agencies control assignments & scheduling

**Discovery challenges**
Consumers must find and establish
trust with care professionals on their own

**Large logistical burden**
Consumers must manage care quality, and
employment logistics (taxes etc.) on their own

## Slide 6: Care professionals are not satisfied with today's employment opportunities

### PROBLEM
Care professionals are not satisfied
with today's employment opportunities

### LACK OF A LIVING WAGE
2022 avg. home care worker wage: $14.50
45% of care professionals live in or near poverty

### LACK OF STABILITY/CONTROL
Agency employees don't control their own
assignments or schedules, contributing to work-family
conflict, work-related stress, and income instability

### PHYSICALLY AND EMOTIONALLY DEMANDING
On the job injuries are 44% higher than US avg.
High levels of reported on-the-job stress

"As home health aides, we work too
hard. We're dealing with too much stress
with the client, and we also have to deal
with family members. We're not getting
paid for how hard we work."
- Farah Germain (HHA, Brooklyn)

## Slide 7: New technologies provide opportunity to improve efficiency, satisfaction & outcomes

### SOLUTION
New technologies provide opportunity to
improve efficiency, satisfaction & outcomes

**Off-the-shelf SaaS tools**
*   Background checks
*   Embedded payroll
*   Earned wage access

**AI/ML**
*   Human "care concierge” backed by AI tooling
*   Personalized matching models

## Slide 13: Recent investment has focused on agency-based care delivery & related SaaS, leaving clear lane for new B2C entrant

### COMPETITION
Recent investment has focused on agency-based care delivery &
related SaaS, leaving clear lane for new B2C entrant

*   **Papa** focused on short, discrete "gigs", delivered B2B2C through employer benefits program
*   **Honor** building similar next gen care management platform, delivered through Home Instead (wholly-owned agency)
*   **Mable and Curam** demonstrating viability of approach overseas (Mable raised $100M General Atlantic growth round in 2021)
