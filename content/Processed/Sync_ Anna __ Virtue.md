### Fundraise Update

- Legal misunderstanding resolved - waiting for legal turn
	- Removing super priority provisions (was aggressive positioning)
	- Block on carve-out of anything under 5% for secondary sales resolved
	- Common board seat clarified - they want one of two common seats available if Aimun leaves for CEO replacement, not taking all seats
- References providing positive feedback
	- Colleen (former CEO from Groups) - proactively connected by Jared, spoke Monday
	- John from Amino (sold to Capital RX) - candid feedback: “these guys are in your corner”
		- Not tech investors, so get other folks in room (why Sunflower makes sense)
		- Transformation Capital will take their markup if raising more money - viewed as positive since they don’t force rapid growth
- Current structure: TCAT $1.5M, Watershed $1M, Sunflower $1.5M
- Diligence process brutal but nearly complete
	- QoE “absurd,” tech dives “beyond nitty gritty”
	- Private equity style diligence applied to early-stage company
	- Exposed areas for finance function investment
- Regulatory items being worked through
	- PCM structure now fully set up with physician owner and MSA
	- Need to contract and credential entity with payer partners including Medicare and MassHealth
	- Lobbyist (former head of HHS) confirms no Massachusetts corporate practice exposure
- Timeline: Still targeting Thursday wire (Jerry to Hawaii Friday, conscious out to India Thursday night)

### Key Hiring Priorities

- Chief Clinical Officer
	- Already found strong candidate - scaled leader, CCO level experience
	- Understands operations partnership, MBA expert
	- Currently happy in role, so recruitment challenging
- Chief People Officer
	- Hiring for biggest risk points - recruiting and retention
	- Will run internal search first, then use True if needed
- Technology leadership role
	- Three core requirements:
	- Question whether true CTO ($350K all-in) or more junior VP/Head of Engineering level
	- Current team: founding engineer (strong), AI/ML contractor (good but can level up)
	- AI drives margin and narrative - margin more important currently
	- Timeline consideration: amortize engineering costs over larger footprint before major investment

### Market Expansion Strategy

- LOI signed for Minnesota and Missouri acquisitions
- Minnesota: $350K total ($250K down, $100K deferred)
- Missouri: $425K total ($75K down, remainder amortized over 6 years - $60-70K annualized cost, generates $50K cash)
- Two expansion options per market:
- Key risks in new markets:
	- Recruiting (biggest concern) - Missouri may need 30 BCBAs across 6 centers (20% of state’s total)
	- Client acquisition speed in new territory
	- 4-5 month lead time for new centers requires year-ahead planning
- Economics comparison:
	- Massachusetts: expensive labor/real estate, okay rates, stiff competition
	- Minnesota: cheap labor/real estate, light competition, good rates
	- Missouri: “outrageous” cheap labor/real estate, “insane” rates
- Plan to survey all 22 target states for acquisition opportunities

### Next Steps and Timeline Items

- Legal docs expected Wednesday at latest for investor review
- Counsel review needed for SPV and co-investor sign-offs
- Timing tight with holiday schedules
- Q1 2026 budget development for board review
- Market expansion sequencing decision needed to inform 2026 budget and hiring timeline
