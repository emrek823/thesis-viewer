#### Oncologist @ Maryland Oncology / Hematology (14 clinics, US Oncology Network)

Tell us about your practice and role

14 clinics

Oncologist, practicing for about 16 years. Part of a group Maryland Oncology / Hematology

Physician owned but contract with US Oncology

Tell us about how you met Solstice and view on product?

The guys had reached out to me as community physician to help streamline the medical record retrieval process and help to make it better for the physician

My needs around record retrieval

None of us really think that EMRs make us more efficient. Most of the products have so many layers of complexity

Always looking for ways to be streamline - medical records are biggest issue by far across our practice for all the technical initiatives we are exploring

If you are working in 1 EMR - you don’t have a lot of visibility. There is some cross talk but you can’t pull records

You don’t know your missing something until you see what you’re missing

Process today vs. what Solstice provides?

Right now, we have people in the medical records department. I have a medical records person that preps charts each day. She’ll reach out to pull these records

She’ll look at what I ordered ahead of time and try to go through and get all the records

More reactive than active today. Patients don’t always remember where they have records. I don’t realize that I’m looking at the records - not her fault

It’s not uncommon for a follow-up patient to say they were admitted last week and we are abruptly looking for the records day of and are unable to pull

How does the medical record retrieval office view?

They came down and worked directly with person that works with medical records. She did a parallel trial for her software and did her regular way of pulling data. She was able to pull everything that she wanted to pull using Solstice

She was very impressed after the initial trial

What is the interaction / decision-making process from US Oncology?

EMR / PM - we’re paying US oncology for business mgmt services. Part of that fee does cover IT costs. We used McKesssons’ EMR called iKnowMed.

Transitioned to new PM system as well

We have a portal specific for US oncology

To do extra things, we have the ability to adapt it to what we need of course.

Can you dive deeper on product experience? What did you work with them on as design partner?

What exact data types we need.

When we have a patient come in, we need a lot of records. Pathology, imaging, labs, notes. Huge amount of data. We discussed how everything should look and the exact data types I’d need for which patients and for follow-up vs. new visits

The actual interface

How much do I want as a physician vs. having the medical records staff do more of the summarization and bringing relevant things to the top

That’s a big value-add. My medical records retrieval staff know what I want most of the time because we’ve worked together, but this staff churns. It’s much, much easier to codify it in Solstice

What do current referral networks look like today?

We’re through the entire state of MD - you are pulling through all of MD and into Washington DC. Multiple big health networks - MedStar, Hopkins, University of MD.

We have 50 odd physicians throughout the organization and we’re also pulling records from all community providers.

I specialize in urological cancers for example so I’m working with a lot of urology groups

There’s large urology groups, independent PCPs that I typically engage with, health systems, radiation oncology that we need to coordinate with

ROI / Decision-making Process

We’re really making our decision off efficiency and completeness of the record pull

Completeness of the records - they’ve already shown in a retrospective study that they are pulling 2x the records that staff was. That’s why my admin was so impressed.

Efficiency - they are able to pull patients same day if you need in minutes. The efficiency is night and day.

For medical record retrieval, it’s such a core part of our operations, that efficiency and completeness alone would cause us to adopt. We all realize the problem and know how this can make us more efficient, see more patients, and drive more revenue to the practice. This isn’t a new fancy widget - just a much better way to do what we are already doing.

Ultimately, the pilot that they did with us is what I’d take to the committee and then they could expand throughout the other practices in our group and throughout US Oncology. We all talk as I mentioned.

Future product developments you’d like to see?

One of the things we discussed recently - Can you adapt it with other groups?

They’ve shown this in some other practices I know and they are able to customize based on oncologist preferences very easily. The core product is the same but it’s great to be able to customize for what I want for the initial implementation

#### Oncologist @ Alabama Oncology (26 physicians, 6 offices)

What’s your role / background?

Primarily cancer surgery but practiced in every setting you could imagine from large hospitals in the northeast, to UAB down here, to community practice currently.

Community practices just have a different pace and way of seeing patients - we are running an optimized business. These academic guys see 1-2 patients per day. Like the pace in a community setting.

How’d you meet the guys? Interaction?

Emailed back and forth - would I mind doing a pilot study

Pilot study and ran through to see what they could find about individual patients. It was accurate and very timely.

It really only took me 2 patients to get hooked.

I had one patients admitted to the hospital that I had enrolled the week before and this guy was in the ICU and it was freaking me out a little bit. They were able to pull that for me immediately and the records were very accurate.

I had another homeless patient who was a meth addict and I knew literally nothing about this patient. Solstice was able to even pull that for me. That’s all I needed to see.

Thoughts on the guys?

I’m investing $100K - no brainer.

They are rolling this out in oncology first which makes sense, but the applications here are way beyond that. Nursing homes, PCPs - it’s hard for me to think of a doctor in our network that we interact with that wouldn’t want this

Life before Solstice

1 full-time person today just for me - we cross-train her to different admin work but she’s stuck chasing down these records all day long.

Start from scratch all the time - do the scans, do the bloodwork. Re-run everything - huge waste of resources and these are smaller things that we don’t make a ton of money on - I want to be doing surgeries.

Most of my patients are coming from another referral or different source. Such an effort to enter it to the EMR. Such an effort to integrate it into the EMR - we end up having to call them.

They send ¾ of it and its faxed. You get it off the fax machine, then they scan it. You call it gets faxed and when you scan it you enter it to the OncoEMR and make a notation what it is.

Literally 5 steps involved that are entirely too cumbersome and unnecessary.

What would you want to see to get this implemented across practice?

Our administrative guys ultimately make the call but its based on oncologist experience.

Really being judge on efficiency + completeness. We need more records and time savings. We see extreme time savings from Solstice it’s not a small delta - we’re talking hours/days vs. minutes with Solstice. I have no idea what their secret sauce is under the hood but it’s incredible.

They can do a retrospective study like they did in Maryland to show the increased completeness of records based on what we’ve done historically and it’s pretty obvious when you do one case how efficient it can be and how much time it can save.

What do you want to see going forward from product perspective?

Your fantasy is to find that stuff and drop and drag into EMR and auto-populates it. The guys wanted to look at clinic record and office record

#### Co-founder at Redox

How has space evolved?

We were too early but that’s a story for another time…I wish I was starting a new company in interop now with all the tools people have at their disposal.

When we started out, it was an entirely different world - we were focused on making it easier to connect the innovators to health systems. Today, we’re trying to pivot more towards the enterprise and take advantage of our push/pull capabilities that we have with health systems.

Future is going beyond this breadth we see with the HIEs. Particle and Health Gorilla are fighting back and forth claiming that one has 92% coverage vs. 90% coverage. At the end of the day, it doesn’t make a huge difference. It’s all about usability.

Have to remember though that you are still getting these JSON files from these guys - easier than dealing with C-CDAs but nothing a provider can actually use

Medical record retrieval specific to oncology - any thoughts/experience?

Oncology data has been poorly supported from a standards perspective and there’s a lot of oncology data that you need that isn’t in the HIEs

Cancer staging, tumor size, different reference labs/biomarker reports - you’re missing that data if you are only working with HIEs

You need something like a Ciox or a Moxe to really get everything you need but they really aren’t working with community practices

Check out mCODE for example - another standard people are trying to create. I don’t think another standard created by a group like ASCO is the solution here (we have enough standards). It’s more of a representation to me of the need and complexity in oncology

Any thoughts on Switchboard or general Ciox/Datavant commentary?

They are trying to pivot out of the manual business and Switchboard is their attempt to automate some of the manual processes and put an API in front of it.
