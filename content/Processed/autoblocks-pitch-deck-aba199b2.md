Autoblocks AI

## Slide 2: Company Purpose

--- COMPANY PURPOSE

Enable safe and trustworthy AI adoption
in healthcare

*   Expert-augmented evaluation systems
*   Standardized best practices for AI safety and accuracy
*   Full-stack platform for health systems with built-in
    trust and safety measures

## Slide 3: Problem

--- PROBLEM

Inaccuracy is still the #1 issue
for orgs using GenAI.

Automated eval metrics are being
used to measure quality at scale,
but most teams don't trust them.

![Abstract graphic with X's on some squares](image_3.png)

## Slide 4: Problem

--- PROBLEM

**Many teams rely**
**heavily on expert-in-**
**the-loop evaluation.**

*   Accuracy can be a matter of life-or-death
*   Auto-evals are useless for specialized domains
*   Legal liability can be damning
*   High regulatory compliance risks

**This is expensive,**
**unscalable, &**
**inefficient.**

*   $ Knowledge workers are expensive labor
*   Expert feedback slows development
*   Labeling workflows are fragmented
*   Precious eval data is stagnant in spreadsheets

## Slide 5: Solution

--- SOLUTION
**USE HUMAN FEEDBACK TO SAVE TIME AND IMPROVE EVALUATION ACCURACY**

**WHAT WE PROVIDE**
| What examples are you testing against? | How are you measuring output quality? | How are you making decisions based on output quality? | How are you validating the decisions? | How are you dealing with confidence thresholds for outputs? |
| :------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------- |
