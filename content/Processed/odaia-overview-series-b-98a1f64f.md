## Slide 25: HCP PowerScore goes Beyond Rx...

The MAPTUAL PowerScore represents the propensity of an HCP to deliver to the brand's objective and is driven by modular pieces **embedded with advanced scalable ML models**

1.  Dynamically scales relative to the view: national, state, regional, rep territory; relative to HCPs in that geo segment
2.  Continuously learns through feedback-loops

**HCP PowerScore Components (Scoring Algorithm dynamically applies different weights to each input module):**

*   **AI - Multi-channel Attribution**
*   **AI - Numerical Predictions** (Rx Volume, Rx Share, Active Patients)
*   **AI - Microsegments** (Predictive Segments, Look-alike Segments)
*   **Historical Microsegments**
*   **Demographic & Socio-Economic Population Trends**
*   **Qualitative Segments** (KOLs, Same Hospital, Same school, Retirement, and more...)
*   **Business Scenario Based Objectives**

**Visual Example:**
An image shows a "Warren Peace" HCP profile with a "9" PowerScore, indicating "Very Valuable HCP". The scoring algorithm combines various inputs (Switch Out: 4, Shrinker: 1, NRx, PSP New Starts, Active Patient) to generate this score.

*   Unify commercial teams through digestible and actionable data insights and achieve brand-wide alignment.
*   Provide real-time and predictive perspective on the dynamic changes of the marketplace.

**RESULTS:**

*   **<2 Days**
    To implement a change in the business objective enabling a fast roll out to the fieldforce
*   **62% New Starts Lift**
    Over a 6 month period
*   **70 Minutes saved**
    On pre-call planning per representative per day (Assuming 5 calls/day/sales rep)

*   Immunology therapeutic in the biologic market with emerging indications, biosimilar entrances & new products launching.

**Objective:**
*   MAPTUAL delivers high quality predictions on prescription volume (TRx, NRx, and NBRx)
*   Leverage MAPTUAL's predictions for sales forecasting and planning

**Prediction Accuracy:**

*   **TRx:** 95%
*   **NBRx:** 96%
*   **NRx:** 99%

*Predictions are made on a **6-months rolling average basis** to account for noise in data*

**Chart: NBRx Prediction Graph**

*   **X-axis:** Dates (Apr '21, Oct '21, Apr '22)
*   **Y-axis:** Value (e.g., 5.3K, 6.0K, 6.8K)
*   **Lines:**
    *   **Actual:** Solid black line with points
    *   **Predicted:** Dashed blue line with points

**Data Points (from graph):**

| Date    | Actual NBRx | Predicted NBRx |
| :------ | :---------- | :------------- |
| Apr '21 | 5.3K        | (no prediction for start) |
| Oct '21 | 6.0K        | (no prediction shown) |
| Apr '22 | 6.8K        | 6.75K          |

**Key Event:**
*   **6-Months Prediction Made in October**: An arrow from Oct '21 pointing to the "Predicted 6.75K" at Apr '22.
*   **Validation in April**: Denotes the actual value at Apr '22.

**Local Explanation Summary (SHAP value (impact on model output)):**
*   A "beeswarm" plot showing the distribution of SHAP values for each feature across different predictions.
*   Features with higher global importance (top of the list) show a wider spread of SHAP values, indicating a greater impact on individual predictions.
*   Red dots generally correspond to higher feature values impacting the model output positively (High prediction), while blue dots correspond to lower feature values impacting it negatively (Low prediction).

**3. Volume Prediction Accuracy - Granular Analysis**

**Chart: NBRx Predictions (Time Series)**
*   A line graph showing "Actual 6 Month Avg." (solid blue) and "Predicted 6 Month Avg." (dashed purple) over time (e.g., June, August).
*   The lines generally follow each other closely, indicating good prediction accuracy.
