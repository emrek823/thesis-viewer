Left Clover to raise money, then went back after leave of absence

How we clean claims

Take piece of paper, use OCR, and make paper charts electronic

GPs are the long tail (not focused on specialist)

They are how you capture HCC codes that payers need

Billing today is only focused on things that get the GPs paid

Insurance companies paid for HEIDS / CPT codes that have no value. GPs don’t get paid

Set up all this infrastructure for retrospective chart pulls

~$100 per chart pull (sometimes x2 for HEDIS and HCC)

Generate claim

Bill

Vendor charge to payer to pull chart

Incentive for provider for chart pull

Tech-enabled services

Built for paper

OCR for paper that are providers review

Philippines / indonesian nurses or coders are typically what people use

Hourly worker with nursing degree

They don’t diagnose patients

We use GPs

Pull out anything that the providers write

Pull out notes and the labs

Sent to the coding team

500K claims running through the platform

1.5M lives on platform (ApolloMed)

Building commodity services to get to the VBC piece

We have systems that…

OCR. Paper to electronic

Misdirect engine. 10-15% of claims need to be redirected to another party (it’s not theirs to pay). They have to take all the claims, see what they have to pay, reject, and send to

We have access to all the claims (500K). Built this mini-clearinghouse

Only one that can do this electronically

Unbatch, change the metadata on the claim and send it out

Structure medical record so people can look for HCCs

We don’t code them but we send them to the coding teams

Geographies

Southern CA

TX

Next steps

Competitors - who else are you seeing out there?

Potential partners / competitors - don’t want long slog of enterprise sales cycle. How do we grow efficiently (e.g., acquiring medical billing co?)

50% of the US is PCP independent / 50% health system or group

Office Ally or Athena ($10-$15 or $5-$7 internally) or 3rd party biller to generate a claim

Claim is generated and gets sent to the clearinghouse

Payer looks and evaluates that claim

Goes back to last year (CY 2021) to do the analysis to figure out where the gaps are in risks adjustment and HEDIS

For providers they have gaps for they need to go and request

Sharing a chart with - charge $40 to the payer. Payer pays GP incentive like $20-$30 (sometimes 2x)

GP is getting asked about visit that happened 18 months ago

If you have a team that can intervene for that patient -> you dont want to know 18 months from date of service

Economics

$ / chart

Charge $0.20 to do the misdirection

Fixed rate for GP incentives

Comps in market

Emdeon (Change)

7% to accelerate payment 2 weeks. That’s the standard

Nobody accelerates risk-adjustment payment 12-18 months

I don’t care what you pay me next July - I don’t care that I’m getting a $1000 bonus

We will take on the risk of that payment but we will take a cut of it

Opportunity

Accelerate payments - we can take 30%

No one does this for risk adjustment or HEDIS

Even the most evolved ACO reach that they need to get charts. They are following the guidance they have today and they are going to have to do the risk adjustment

Competitors

Sheerwater, HealthFidelity, Episource

Competitive advantage is low-cost labor

Internal tooling - 30% bump in efficiency
