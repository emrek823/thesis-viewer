### On-Sheet Diligence Summary

Xing & Yang had the strongest references of any founder team we have backed at Virtue. References were categorically positive on both Xing & Yang. Note – while listed references are weighted toward Xing we had several very off-sheet references on both Xing & Yang and given how positive initial references were relative to which the speed the seed round came together, we committed to Xing & Yang prior to all on-sheet references conducted.

### Xing - Fmr. Uber Freight, Sr. Launcher (Direct Report)

Xing strengths

One of most compassionate people she has ever met; particularly impressive wrt to how quantitative and analytical he is; very thoughtful and builds on foundation of integrity.

Best balance of people skills + analytical skills

Very good at building teams.

She’s now at an early stage co; nobody she works with/under compared to Xing.

Very impressed with his ability to straddle high-level strategy with low-level tactical execution.

Truly never met anyone who’s able to build a top-down strategy and execute on it

Very hard to find someone who lives in both camps

He is a “dreamer” — can see beyond how things today; can see beyond how things are done today and create a

Every time we would sit down together and whiteboard a problem. HE’d never be stuck in this how you can do it today

He’s so thoroughly vetted this idea.

How are you going to get operating leverage on this side of the business? Etc?

They know their shit and if they don’t know they will find out

1-2 specific examples?

“Everything”

Very good at identifying thoughtful shortcuts

He is really good at helping others help him

He was genuinely putting in all-nighters 4-5 nights in a row.. and did this for months at a time

Gotten better @ understanding what is high priority

Recruiting

Wide network and able to sniff out talent directly

Built out team of 3 others

How meticulously he sourced and diligence candidates

Experience as being a direct report to Xing

It was “incredible” — brilliant, compassionate,

How can we best support / partner with Xing?

Trust his instincts

His perfectionism can be crippling; he is constantly balancing between Uberism of ‘done better than perfect’ and Xing’s desire to be perfect.

### Xing - Uber, ex Head of China Expansion (Manager)

Intro

On the expansion team at Uber together; these individuals have to build the business from scratch in new markets (e.g. China); believed in localized teams — individuals who were analytical, data-driven and brave (regulatory issues, intense competition, etc.).

Finished data science program in record time

Strong analytical experience + incredibly personable == quiet killer; very driven and hardworking; can go deep & wide.

Was he additive to the team? HELL YES.- stepped in big time. Learned fast. Step in to take over big markets within 3 months of joining. It was challenging to build business and have regulations chase them down, competitors changing them hotel to hotel

He built incredible trust up, down and around. Teams loved him - measured calm balanced

Specific examples

When they met Xing was 26, dropped into Tier 2/3 cities (not Shanghai!); not developed; and, he had to be willing to roll up his sleeves, galvanize the driver community, manage regulators that were trying to shut him down & arrest Xing and his team; he has thick skin & a healthy skin.

He thrived in an incredibly difficult position w/o being an asshole.

He considered leaving Uber post-merger (china merger); Head of Autonomous Freight — recommended that Xing

Ability to recruit / build teams

Quality bar at Uber was incredibly high

Part of the expansion job is to hire at hire rate; convincing people to leave Tier 1 cities and relocate to Tier 2/3 cities, take a pay cut and move home was impressive.

Would spin up contractor teams of 25-50 within 1-1.5 months.

His quality bar is quite high.

Where to improve / support Xing

Xing & Yang have an incredible bond; during an Uber interview Xing told CL that he wanted to build a business with his brother.

B/C they’re twins they are very comfortable speaking with each other.

Be sounding boards to the both of them.

### Xing - Uber Freight, GM Strategy & BD/peer

Worked together at Uber freight

Highly regarded internally; expects him to be highly successful with Xin.

Feedback:

He can spend too much time/energy in the weeds of details that are secondary to core priority items; keep him focused on the big picture.

Ensure he doesn’t burn out; he burnt out at end of Uber freight

Not a morning person, works late nights.

### Xing - Uber Freight, Head of Strategy & BD (Most recent manager)

Uber Freight. Leads strategy, M&A, BD, and global expansion.

Interaction / First impression with Xing:

Met Xing in ~2017; early Freight employee.

Xing wore multiple hats; ops intensive in early days.

Was a “working machine”

Formally began working together in 2018-end/early-2019

Xing then led int’l expansion (LH gave him the responsibility); he created a small 3-4 person team to work on global expansion — Europe, Canada, Mexico, Australia, Brazil, etc. In a matter of months, identified new markets, teams and plans behind initial launches.

Very organized but has a strong bias for action.

Early 2020 got hit by pandemic, had to reduce expansion efforts; sold Europe to another startup for equity stake in business.

Xing is a unique talent, rare to find; analytical chops, go-getter attitude, connections / network, etc., very rare to find. And, a good person to work with.

Help:

He runs hard and hot — need to avoid burnout.

As investors, I need to remind Xing not to burn out.. needs a little balance.

Doesn’t need us to tell him what to do — do not micromanage him; give him space to operate (creative license).

Consistently ask “how can we help you?”

Character

High trust guy

### Yang - Ex Director of Product at Quip/Salesforce; worked closely for 2 years

Joined Matrix in JAn 2021 after a decade in product roles — MSFT, Harvard MBA, Soundcloud, etc.

Yang

You can be fast + good but typically not both — Yang is both; he is genuinely special

Made a point to work w/ Yang as much as possible.

Talent / Recruiting

Top tier; he only recruits and surrounds himself with A+ people

He fast and good
