### Ann Klein’s Background & Experience

- Previously worked at Oracle, Siebel Systems
- Started company that was sold to Salesforce (now Salesforce Industries)
- Was the healthcare specialist within larger software companies
- Experience in strategy work at Accenture before joining Siebel
- Currently involved with Capsico (RWE vendor partnering with Accenture)

### Vineti Experience & Lessons Learned

- Was brought in during Series B - company had strong CTO and good architecture
- Received calls from investors in 2021 (including Mark Benioff) about issues
- Key challenges:
	- Custom code for each implementation instead of configurable platform
	- $65M OpEx on only $2M ARR
	- Pricing challenges: sold at $200-300K when should have been several million
	- Ultimately shut down in 2022 with 4-month wind down due to cancer patients on system
- Outcome: J&J bought IP and hired most technical staff
- Key lesson: Pharma companies resist standardization, each wanting customization

### Current Projects

- Working with Capsico on real-world evidence (RWE)
	- Going to market with Accenture
	- Expanding into brand launch forecasting
- Involved with Exela (life insurance AI company)
	- Still pre-seed stage
	- Cautious about raising too much capital while selling to brokers
	- Co-founded by Angus (AI focus) and Nick (wealth management focus)

### Healthcare Technology Insights

- Integration is crucial for healthcare software success
- Pricing strategy critical - particularly transition from clinical to commercial
- Need to consider who pays (e.g., pharma vs. hospital) in go-to-market strategy
- Multi-company systems create complexity in healthcare
- Importance of strategic partnerships with major players like Cardinal, McKesson

### Action Items

- Ann to introduce Emre to Exela team
