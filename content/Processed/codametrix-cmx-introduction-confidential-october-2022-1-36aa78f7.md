# Introduction

## CODAMETRIX

CodaMetrix (CMX) is a SaaS technology company providing an AI-powered platform to facilitate healthcare revenue cycle management and coding. The CMX platform combines Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to autonomously code Professional Billing (PB) cases.

By the end of 2022, CMX will be in use at several large provider organizations serving over 145 hospitals. The current CMX solutions in radiology and pathology are on schedule to expand to modules for surgery, gastroenterology, inpatient professional billing, and emergency department services during 2023.

## Slide 3: Medical Coding

# Medical Coding

## CODAMETRIX

**$9.5 billion Total Addressable Market (TAM) w/ 7% CAGR**
Professional Billing (PB) (physicians' services)

**Highly manual, complicated and messy workflow**
Quality and results are inconsistent

**The costliest part of Revenue Cycle Management (RCM)**
Coding costs represent 25% of the total cost of RCM

**Professional coders are highly paid ($25-35 / hr.)**
Many are retiring, causing 20% open positions

**Physicians' reimbursement is determined by codes, and revenue integrity is dependent on coding quality**

**Existing NLP-centric automation solutions are expensive, brittle, not easy to deploy, and max out at automating 50% of the volume**

**Doctors hate coding their own cases, and end up memorizing a handful of codes that reflect their routine visits, without sufficient clinical specificity**

**Claims coding data is notoriously inadequate because fee-for-service coding standard is medical necessity vs. population health that requires clinical specificity**

**Medical coding drives more than just RCM (CPT, ICD-10,...)**
* Reimbursement & Revenue
* Risk Adjustment & Quality Measures
* Prior-Authorization and Utilization Management
* Care Gaps and Care Plans
* Research and Patient Recruitment for Clinical Trials

## CODAMETRIX

### Autonomous Coding

Unobtrusively acting as a filter to reduce the manual coding volume:
*   No changes to clients' current workflow or training required
*   Touchlessly coding majority of clients' claims volume
*   Forward unautomated cases to clients' existing coding workflow

| Benefit                       | Description                         |
| :---------------------------- | :---------------------------------- |
| 30% reduction cost of coding  |                                     |
| 60% reduction in coding denials |                                     |
| Explainability & Evidence     |                                     |
| 60% reduction in manual coding |                                     |
| 5X improvement in lag time    |                                     |
| Configurable Coding Quality   |                                     |

### CMX-Automate™ Workflow:
1.  **With CodaMetrix: Physician notes from EHR**
    *   AI-predictions go directly to billing functions
    *   Low confidence cases go to coders
        *   60% fewer cases will be coded by coding team (CAC/EHR)
        *   Cases are sent for Claims processing

### Coding Automation Rate Over Time Comparison:
CMX Outperforms the NLP-Centric Solutions by combining the power of deep learning, machine learning and NLP.

## CODAMETRIX

### A Transformative Opportunity

**The Problem**
In a predominantly fee-for-service reimbursement environment, coding is focused on meeting payers' "medical necessity" requirements. This requires specialty specific modules and data.

With the proliferation of value-based care payment systems, population health analytics and quality measures, and auto adjudication of claims at the point of care, coding will require clinical detail and specificity. Those requirements will make manual coding time intensive and cost prohibitive

**The Solution**
AI-powered autonomous coding with trained models to code with high quality clinical specificity, which requires training AI models on a specialty-by-specialty basis.

CMX can be a major supplier of clinically enriched claims data to all vendors serving the revenue cycle and population health market with software applications or services.

**CMX-Adjudicate™**
*   Reimbursement & Revenue (fee-for-service)
*   Risk Adjustment & Quality Measures (Pop Health)
*   Prior-Authorization and Utilization Management
*   Clinical Documentation Improvement (CDI)
*   Research and Patient Recruitment for Clinical Trials
*   Care Gaps and Care Plans
