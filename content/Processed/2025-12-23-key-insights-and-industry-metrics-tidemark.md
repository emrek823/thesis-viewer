At Tidemark, we know the opportunity in Vertical SaaS is just starting to unfold.

‍

Some of the best businesses in the world are Vertical SaaS companies that have grown into incredible platforms–we’re fortunate enough to have worked with almost a dozen that have scaled to over $100 million in revenue–but the path to get there can be murky.

‍

While building a Vertical SaaS company has been compared to making a layer cake by following a recipe, we know it’s not that simple. Vertical SaaS CEOs frequently ask us questions like: *When is the right time to* [*go multi-product*](https://www.tidemarkcap.com/vskp-chapter/multi-product)*? What are the* [*right products*](https://www.tidemarkcap.com/vskp-chapter/multi-product-getting-started) *to expand into? How should I think about building* [*payments*](https://www.tidemarkcap.com/vskp-chapter/payments) *and lending products? How should* [*AI*](https://www.tidemarkcap.com/post/ai-extinction-or-evolution) *fit into my strategy?* There are complex product decisions for which no clear answers are readily available.

‍

Since the beginning, we’ve been committed to helping Vertical SaaS operators by providing [frameworks](https://www.tidemarkcap.com/vskp) to help scale their businesses. We then created [communities of collective knowledge and earned wisdom](https://www.tidemarkcap.com/series/vertical-saas-operating-excellence) around these frameworks. Through these initiatives, we’ve heard from Vertical SaaS operators that they lack the right data to help them make decisions.

‍

That’s why we’re so excited to launch the 2024 Vertical & SMB SaaS Benchmark Report. We collected information from nearly 250 Vertical SaaS operators to provide data that no one has publicly gathered before. The report covers industry-specific metrics and benchmarks for a wide range of topics, including attach rates and revenue lifts from launching new products. Ultimately, this report is meant as a guide to help Vertical SaaS executives make data-driven decisions.

### Key Survey Findings

### The Vertical SaaS Knowledge Project

‍

This survey quantifies the Vertical SaaS trends we’ve seen over decades of investing and shows our [Vertical SaaS Knowledge Project (VSKP)](https://www.tidemarkcap.com/vskp) in action. The VSKP provides vertical SaaS leaders with a guide on how to scale their companies through strategic frameworks and case studies. At its core, the VSKP framework consists of four steps:

‍

### The Control Point You Pick Matters

‍

The [control point](https://www.tidemarkcap.com/vskp-chapter/control-points-2-0) is the most important system, the last to be thrown out before an owner ceases operations.

‍

Respondents that started with POS, CRM, and Practice Management control points have the highest median attach rate for their second products.

### Explore Which Expansion Products Offer The Greatest Returns

‍

Understanding where to expand remains one of the hardest transitions for a software company to make. You can download the report below to see the data for the 5 products that drive the most incremental Average Revenue per Account (ARPA).

### Don’t Miss Our Data-Rich Deep Dives Into Fintech and AI

‍

The 2024 Vertical & SMB SaaS Benchmark Report features two product deep dives (one on fintech and one on AI). Respondents are rapidly building both AI and fintech products, and you can find the detail on how they are doing it.

‍

#### Sizing The Potential of Fintech Products

‍

Nearly 40% of respondents offered a fintech product. Fintech products can address key merchant needs while driving ARPA for Vertical SaaS Vendors. For the survey respondents, Payments at 30% was by far the most common fintech expansion product. This was followed by Lending at 11% and Payroll at 9%.

‍

#### Understanding AI’s Pervasiveness and Monetization

‍

Our research finds that 31% of respondents have an AI product in the market, and 39% plan to launch one in the next year or so.

‍

AI is currently most prominent in the Back Office and Commerce/Front Office functions.
