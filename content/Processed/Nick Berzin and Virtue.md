### Company Backgrounds

- Nick Berzin (Talys)
	- Deloitte consultant until 2021
	- Built pediatric care delivery business (12 clinicians, private pay, $275/hour targeting private schools)
	- Design product studio with 10 employees
	- MIT background in operations research, AI research
	- Connected with 300 executives across 158 health systems
- Bobby (Talys)
	- VP Engineering at Q Health
	- Head of supply chain/logistics software at Amazon Pharmacy/Pillpack
	- Alexa security and compliance software
	- Built parts of AWS services like Sagemaker

### Product & Market Opportunity

- Clinical engagement wasn’t initial focus - answer #6 or #7 after extensive customer discovery
- Identified gap: analytics providers (GHX, Vizient, ECRI) sell $1-2M procedural analytics but hospitals struggle with implementation
	- Only way to implement is through clinical engagement and connecting to actual execution
	- Competitors want to partner with Talys for this missing piece
- AI facilitates clinical engagement through:
	- Personalized outreach to clinicians with cost/outcome comparisons
	- Evidence aggregation from publications and clinical data
	- Visual product comparisons (clinicians recognize products visually, not by name)
	- Batch communication to avoid overwhelming doctors
- Risk-share model: 20-25% of documented savings vs market standard 35-40%
	- Monitor compliance and provide re-engagement tools
	- Market precedent with players like Kermit and Case Check

### Customer Validation & Pilot Details

- AtlantiCare pilot (primary focus)
	- 5-hour Friday call with Chief Supply Chain Officer Barbara
	- Met COO, CFO, CIO, CTO
	- Sold head of surgery while he was performing surgery (scrubbed into OR)
	- Passed IT security review in 2 days
	- Current $10M value analysis goal
	- Nick (OR Performance group) estimates additional $3M savings potential with Talys
- Dropped Novant and Memorial Health pilots
	- Novant: no executive sponsorship above director level
	- Memorial: disorganized, no ownership accountability
- Orthopedic surgeon example: 800-1,000 procedures/year, 8-year Stryker user
	- Won’t change primary system but opportunity in expensive accessories (pedicle screws, bone DBM)
	- “Lot of fat on the bone” outside tier-one preference items

### Fundraising & Next Steps

- Shifting from feedback to active fundraising this week
- Target: close pre-seed by end of month to focus on AtlantiCare pilot execution
- Seeking partners with:
	- Healthcare system connections
	- Talent network access
	- Understanding of health tech/hospital sales pitfalls
- Key metrics to prove over next 6 months:
	- Clinical engagement - seamless user experience that clinicians actually use
	- Opportunity identification - manual process first, then automation
- Flair Capital involvement being finalized (seed fund vs pre-seed decision pending)
- 8 investor calls scheduled between today and Tuesday
