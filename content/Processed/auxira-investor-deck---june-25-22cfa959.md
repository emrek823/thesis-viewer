## Slide 2: Auxira's Purpose

Auxira is a virtual cardiology platform
for busy practice capacity expansion
and admin burnout relief.

## Slide 3: Cardiologists' day-to-day has evolved significantly...

Confidential & Proprietary

The advent of EHRs has significantly increased admin burden for providers, while 10,000 Americans aging into Medicare daily creates an unsustainable capacity demand on physicians

**Workload Distribution Comparison**
*   **1990s:** Primarily "Existing Patients" and "New Patients" workload, with minimal "Admin & Messaging".
*   **Today:** A significant increase in "Admin & Messaging" burden, alongside growth in "New Patients" and a relative decrease in "Existing Patients" workload, indicating a shift in physician's day-to-day activities.

**Key Statistics**
*   1.6x increase in cardiology patient wait times
*   Over a third of cardiologists are burned out and some are considering a career change

**Sources:**
*   https://cardiovascularbusiness.com/topics/patient-care/new-patients-face-3-week-wait-visit-cardiologists - 16.8 days in 2014

## Slide 4: ...Affecting Satisfaction, Retention and Margins

Confidential & Proprietary

Cardiology practices need a solution for better work/life balance

*   **38%** of cardiologists are burned out¹
*   **38%** of cardiology professionals have considered accepting a reduction in compensation for more autonomy/work-life balance²
*   **11%** of cardiology professionals are looking to change employers in the next year²

Administrative burdens & low acuity work are fueling access constraints, patient leakage, and missed revenue opportunities.

## Slide 9: The Program Has Proven Results

Confidential & Proprietary

**Improve Access**
The virtual APP workforce increases the availability of appointments for both existing and new patients
*Metrics Impacted*
*   Provider panel size
*   Number of new patient visits
*   Average wait time for third next appointment

**Grow Revenue**
By increasing the APP workforce, lower RVU visits can be assigned to non-cardiologist roles. Cardiologists have more capacity for high RVU value visits, such as new and high acuity patients
*Metrics Impacted*
*   Net Patient Revenue
*   Average RVUs per day
*   Margin

**Boost Wellbeing**
The virtual APP workforce will be able to reply to portal messages for patients in the cardiologists' panel, reducing after-hours "pajama time" that cardiologists spend in the EHR
*Metrics Impacted*
*   After-hours EHR time

**Deepen Loyalty**
Since the Auxira workforce will be an extension of the health system (white-labelled), patients seeing Auxira providers will deepen their relationship with the system. They will also remain in the system for future care needs.
*Metrics Impacted*
*   Net Promoter Score (NPS)
*   Press Ganey Scores
*   Patient Leakage

---

**Proven Results**

*   **37%** reduction in time to third next available appointment
*   **14%** increase margin
*   **9.5%** increase wRVU/day
*   **35%** reduction in after-hours EHR time
*   **14%** improvement in top-box Press Ganey score
