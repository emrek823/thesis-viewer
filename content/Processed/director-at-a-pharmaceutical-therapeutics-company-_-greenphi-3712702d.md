## Client-Expert Interaction

### Client
Hello and thanks for taking the time to speak with me about the clinical trial finance and accounting software space. Now before we get into my specific questions, could you give us a 30-second rundown on your role within the company, where you sit within the organization?

### Expert
Of course. I spent my last 11 years in the biotech pharma industry. Worked at different companies including someone as small as Verve Therapeutics, someone as bigger as Moderna, and Bristol Myers Squibb, the pharma. Have been participating in the company's cycles of FP&#x26;A and long-range planning, especially for clinical trials for R&#x26;D stuff.

Being able to help the company understand when it comes to planning for next five years, 10 years, in relation to how many trials should we run, what type of R&#x26;D projects should we really begin from now, but also being able to run RFP together with our procurement leaders to evaluate vendors in the space. Greenphire being one of those we just recently evaluated apart from other companies.

My current role is really to help our clinical trial team to be able to select our IT stack for handling payments, handling compliance, enforcements, but also generally speaking for site level, understand what is the best auditing-ready expectations from different regions from U.K. to U.S., Canada to EU5 countries. That's why I think I can speak to the topic here in relation to how does pharma companies choose procurement and payment solutions, how does that fit into our FP&#x26;A cycles, and ultimately, what are the value propositions from these third-party vendors.

### Client
Got it. How large is the company that you work with? I don't know how many trials you have going on or what phase the trials are in, but just trying to understand where you fit in the pharmaceutical biopharma landscape from a size perspective.

### Expert
Sure. The current company is a $6-billion post-revenue company in terms of yearly revenue. That being said, we have TAs, generally speaking, the infectious disease vaccine trials, also oncology, autoimmune disease, so three major TAs. That being said, we have about 8,000 FTEs.

### Client
Got it. You'd probably be in the mid-market, maybe even the enterprise?

### Expert
Right. I would say so, like a biotech/biopharma.

## Client
Great. It seems like you're involved in the selection process. Are you involved in the day-to-day usage? I know you use Auxilius. How involved are you?

## Expert
I've been a user of Auxilius, Greenphire, IQVIA, something called Advarra Payments, and also Calyx, ClinPay, these type of tools. I think in the most recent two or three years, more like the key decision-maker in the RFP.

## Client
Got it. Now that you're using an Auxilius, how mission-critical is a software solution like that? Maybe said another way, if your budget was cut by 50%, is that something that you would keep or cut?

## Expert
For the current company size, I would say Auxilius would be a 4/5 criticality. It's a very purpose-built for smaller companies' finance team. It's a light lift for IT. In that case, you're emerging biotech, you need faster close of your finance, etc., Auxilius is great. Like I said, post-revenue, we are public, and everything. We're becoming a pharma.

We actually are leaning less on Auxilius, but we still do any of them on some emerging markets. For example, in China, in some European countries, especially Poland, etc. For our established markets, U.S., Canada, EU5, we're actually more, for example, IQVIA, Medidata, Advarra, Greenphire, just because these are on the other side of the spectrum of companies who are larger payments.

Where you're running global trial with travel hurdles, you are having banking networks you have to worry about. I think, in that case, Auxilius is less critical versus these companies, if you are having the same sense of. That means that in the past 10 years, or in past five years, I'd say, Auxilius has been more critical.

## Client
Got it. Has it been more critical because of the increase in rules and regulations?

## Expert
Yes, especially the SEC and FDA regulations for emerging start-up companies and biotech companies. Even if your academia has been off, they would require you to have your own financials and everything. These companies do have to have a fast close. They don't even have a finance team. They may have only one guy who is the CFO. What do they do? They can use Auxilius for extremely light IT lift very quick.

## Client
Got it. Tell me if I'm wrong, I won't put words in your mouth, but it seems like Auxilius is a good solution for emerging or more SMB biopharma companies. I'm assuming the biggest issue that it solves is the accruals. First, is what I just said true, or did I miss anything?

## Expert
You're spot on. What is normally been done is start-up companies rely on Microsoft Excel to do the expense because they oftentimes are taking their investors' money, whether it's a PE- or a VC-backed company. When it comes to sending invoices, think about these trial drivers. It's either the number of patients, the number of their visits per patient, but also different countries. You have to forecast your spending, which is why when I was in my previous role in Verve, every month, we have to do this spending forecast for our investors. It's a nightmare. This automation of accruals is actually another nightmare.

Auxilius does have a lot of automation and AI enablement here to make things easier. However, they actually are pretty accurate. You can actually think about Auxilius can replace your need to hire a financial team here. These are a team of five, for example. Also, they help you to generate your site and vendor invoices because as a start-up, you actually are highly outsourcing. You don't have a clinical team, you don't have.

## Transcript

### Clinical Trial Recruitment Discussion

**Client:**
From your understanding, obviously, they have some tech, but is there also people in the background helping run these analyses, or is it all software?

**Expert:**
They have a pretty capable team, so-called a technical support team. A majority of their customer base are so-called Series A to public biotechs. These are companies who, generally speaking, they don't care about their future. They care about getting POC, proof of concept, and then sell themselves.

In that regard, they want to get things done, but then they got the software. They sometimes do not necessarily know how to use that to the best. Auxilius has a team to support the training part, but also they help with something called a scenario model program. They can help you to do some FP&#x26;A, even for your funding needs. That's actually with additional money spending, of course, but it's more like consulting model.

I think Auxilius is growing out of itself these days. The service is not catching up well. That being said, you can still understand why they have grown so much for the past two years. It's almost like 10X of revenue growth. I think a lot of those customers are hooked because Auxilius is really owning up around things for them.

**Client:**
How big do you think they are from a revenue standpoint?

**Expert:**
I was actually guessing roughly about $400 million-$600 million. I could be from around to very wrong. I just know they have roughly 10-12 Series A to public biotech. Maybe half of those are very close to go IPO. If each is contributing roughly, let's say, $20 million, $30 million, that's roughly about. I think at least $300 million each.

**Client:**
Okay. When the company does get bigger, you said, for you, since your company has clearly grown, they're less valuable, or it seems like growing out of them. How is that the case, if I got that right?

**Expert:**
Here's the life cycle of biotech. Between zero to five years, you are dealing with Auxilius to take care of all your vendors, in this case, contractors, whether it's a CRO, contract research organization who runs trials for you, or a CMO, manufacturing the drugs for you for supply. You are very outsourced.

Until one day, you're like, "Hey, I became IPO'd. I want to start to internalize some of these functions because now my shareholders are urging me to save cost, meanwhile, generate more values down the road." I started to hire people to deal with individual trial sites. In this case, you don't hire a CRO for everything. You just hire them as more like a point solution. Maybe the CRO is only there for you to recruit patients. However, for those patient, individual patients to think about coming to your site for a follow-up and such, they need to reimburse their travels, for example.

Now, Auxilius did not cover that. You have to hire people to take care of all those reimbursements, verification, whatever. That's where other tools like Greenphire, they have this ClinCard, if you know that one. They have this prepaid card system, also the automatic auditing system to reimburse participants.

whole thing can be automated in that regard.

Maybe you are five years to 10 years of biotech. You start to think about internalizing stuff. You want to have some end-to-end workflow solution, there you go, Auxilius is no longer just end-to-end workflow for all these accruals to payments to auditing. They're only about accruals, for most senses, which is why I think that that's maybe the timing of us too in the early days, but now we are even over that phase.

**Client**
Right. I don't think I realized they did payments as well.

**Expert**
You mean Greenphire?

**Client**
No, Auxilius.

**Expert**
They don't cover payments. I don't think so. They are mostly about accrual automation.

**Client**
Okay. That's what I thought. It seems like you did an assessment between Auxilius, Condor. I don't know if there's any other player. First question, were there any other folks that you evaluated when you chose Auxilius?

**Expert**
We did an RFP, and this RFP included at least six players, so Condor, Auxilius, Greenphire, another small company but emerging player, a company which is bigger called IQVIA, a bigger company called a Medidata, part of Dassault, I believe, and also a company Sean Doolan called Advarra Payments, and the last company is called Calyx, ClinPay.

**Client**
Got it. When did you do this RFP?

**Expert**
End of year 2024 to quarter one 2025, so literally wrapped up by February. It was an extension of our S&#x26;OP meeting from 2024 where we did a long-range planning for our trials. The company is repurposing our resource here because we have a downfall in sales of COVID vaccine. We want to do more in oncology and autoimmune disease stuff. We know, in those two areas, the trial expense is higher.

From that, we also are aware of the trial type, the patient recruitment complexities, and also outsourcing structures are all going to be changing. We wanted to find a better tool for that for us, which winds up having this RFP. We have included our vendor we have been using also in this RFP, sweat them a little bit, to get the proposal eventually to give us the better sense to compare with each other, but also to align with our one, three, five years long-range planning, to understand if we are, for example, having this many of users per year for the next five years, which one actually give the best quotes on these, for example, volume-based discounts, etc.

**Client**
Got it. Auxilius, even though they were part of the RFP, were they your existing provider?

**Expert**
They are still. We are not getting rid of any players. We have been using more for the greenfield expansion. Like I said before, for all the infectious disease areas which we have been focusing on for the past 10 years,

we are not changing the players here because they are still legacy system. To switch is a lot of pain, by the way, cost plus timing.

For newly opened greenfield areas, for example, this oncology space, we have a cancer vaccine. For this autoimmune disease space, we have an ERT, enzyme replacement therapy. All these trials are so different. From before, we are looking at adopting Medidata for oncology, adopting a combo between Greenphire and Calyx for autoimmune disease. That's more based on BU, business units.

**Client**
Got it. Talk to me a little bit about Condor if you could. It seems like they were in the RFP, but they didn't win the RFP, obviously. Why did you choose Auxilius over a Condor for your accruals and FP&#x26;A?

**Expert**
In early days, we actually have been using Condor, I wouldn't use the word interchangeably, but more so as a backup to Auxilius. Auxilius was the one we chose in the beginning to help us, post-IPO, to go a quick site start-up in some countries I mentioned before, in EU region. Condor has been the one we have been using for U.S.-based sites.

I think they have a connection with PwC. PwC was the consultant we hire for our site readiness. Condor has been the software PwC integrated for us for our Boston, California, and South Carolina sites. The use case is more about also monthly accruals. In this case, it's more about reconciliation of different accrual across our different states.

In the U.S., Condor is a better, I would say, alternative than Auxilius, which is more of a centralized way of doing accruals, at least that's what we concluded to use them for. In its most recent RFP, Condor has not been selected for greenfield expansion, but has been kept for our three different states here in the U.S. still for [ID], for.

**Client**
Got it. You use Condor in the U.S. for your three, it sounds like, main sites, and then for non-U.S. expansion, that's where you're using Auxilius?

**Expert**
Right. Another major reason is Condor is very focused on the sponsor finance because when you're running a trial, you're the sponsor. It's always a triangle. There's also the site, and there's also the participant. They don't cover for those two others. When it comes to the greenfield expansion for other TA, especially oncology, think about each oncology patient. It normally incurs roughly $60,000 during the whole duration until endpoint. Those are things we cannot necessarily use Condor for, and we actually are going to implement Greenphire for that.

**Client**
Got it. The reason you're not using Condor is because of the type of study and the nuances in the type of study?

**Expert**
Yes. Also, remember when we are solely relying on CRO, it's called PPD, part of Thermo Fisher, PPD is literally in charge of everything. They have enough team members to cover those. Now, we don't want to continue working with PPD because PPD is charging a high premium for at least a one-stop shop type of contract.

We are having a reduced demand, which is why we cannot keep that commitment with PPD. We are now using PPD instead of a one-stop shop, more so like a functional service provider. That's why we have to deal with the participants payments, and also even the site payments ourselves. All these participant site payment audit trails are being kept in Greenphire right now.

## Client
Got it. Maybe talk to me about, if you can, the differences between Condor and Auxilius. Since you use both, which one do you like better? If you were an investor, which one would you bet on between those two?

## Expert
Yes. First difference comes from, I would say, the software interface. When it comes to Auxilius, it's more modernized. When you think about entering the enterprise level, Auxilius is better for upper management and people who are actually called budget holders to take a look. They oftentimes are able to help them to make decisions too very quickly.

When it comes to Condor, it's better for, generally speaking, managers and people who are actually doing the daily work because it's more granular. It's oftentimes with more data to look at. Also, they are, generally speaking, having action charts. For the primary function, I would say besides the UI, Condor is very similar to Auxilius. Auxilius is everything about clinical finance platform, for accruals, budgeting, your forecasting, and even one thing they do better is called the scenario modeling. Condor is covering mostly just accrual and the automation part of that as well as reconciliation.

When you have a relatively straightforward trial, for example, in Europe, where it's more like in a specific country, say Italy, then Auxilius is able, for you, to get things started faster. However, if you are dealing with the states, oftentimes, it's more complicated. You have a lot of issues. I think there's literally more fraud here. You have to think about reconciliation as a priority. Condor, in terms of the primary functionality, is better in that area. These two companies are similar. However, one is more about fast start-up versus one is more about solving problems.

Now, I would say, the target users are also a little bit different. Like I said before, Auxilius would be facing the FP&#x26;A team who are mostly executives, CFO, for example. These are normally the mid-sized and small-sized start-up companies. For Condor, you're still dealing with those FP&#x26;A team, but these are managers, clinical-stage financial managers, and such. These are people who are approving invoices. That's why the granular level is needed for the reconciliation or problem-fixing.

### Sean Doolan
That being said, you would realize the implementation time for Auxilius is generally speaking half as compared to Condor, like two weeks to three weeks versus Condor is one month to two months. Condor does have a testimonial from PwC white paper. Also, PwC is using them as major software for customers.

## Client
Got it. Which solution is better for the SMB, mid-market, and enterprise?

## Expert
Condor is better for the midmarket, clinical-stage biotech who are no longer a start-up. These companies do need literally more audit-ready monthly accrual close. I think Auxilius would be more for even earlier company who, they need better planning, they need better forecasting. They would have a lot of investors at this stage who are literally sitting on their board, that type of board-level finance narratives. Auxilius is more better user interface, user experience for upper management. I would say, that's the reason.

## Client
How many of those midmarket clinical biotech start-ups do you think there are out there? I know there's about 4,000 companies, but how many in that ICP?

## Expert
In the U.S., I know for Kendall Square or Massachusetts, in total, there's about 200 companies every year. I don't know if you ever go to those consortiums in Kendall Square, but they would always have this list of 200 top companies in Kendall Square. In the whole U.S., you can think about there is also SoCal, there's also Triangle Research Park. It's totally, generally speaking, 3X of that. Roughly, 600 companies are so-called clinical-stage midmarket biotech companies in the U.S. For the world, I would say, it should be doubled from that number.

## Client
I missed it. What's the number?

## Expert
From the 600 companies. In Massachusetts, it's 200, and in the whole U.S., it will be three of 200, that's 600. For the whole world, that should be two of the 600, that's 1,200.

## Client
That's just midmarket?

## Expert
Yeah, clinical-stage midmarket biotech.

## Client
Got it. Do you know how many enterprise there are?

## Expert
We normally would have this top 100 pharma company list from S&#x26;P. The top 100 pharma companies in the U.S., about half of that can make it to S&#x26;P 500, sometimes like that. These are, I would call out, for the U.S. For the world, I would say there are more. I would say triple this number would be fair, so 100 for U.S., 300 for the rest of the world. Total of 400.

## Client
Okay. Jumping back to Auxilius versus Condor. Auxilius is more positioned for the SMB. They have better reporting to executives like board members, but maybe they're more necessary because they can do a little bit more and they have that better board reporting when the finance team is smaller. Don't let me put words in your mouth. Tell me if I'm wrong on any of this. As the company grows and it goes into that midmarket range, then maybe Condor is a better fit.

## Expert
Largely, you're right. Did you guys just mention about for Auxilius' customer base, that type of company is at 4,000 something? If I'm thinking of early to mid-stage biotech start-ups, I would say, it's between 4,000 and 8,000 companies in the world. These are companies who, generally speaking, will die. Most of them will die or be consolidated. Very few, less than 10% will eventually become a bigger company.

These are the companies who are, generally speaking, going to be the potential target for Auxilius. However, only that 10% guys will eventually switch because they grow out of themselves. Let's say, if they remain as a small company or they are just being integrated, I think in that case, it's actually a pretty successful exit for Auxilius, or maybe the parent company will still keep on using Auxilius for this business unit, at least for another few years.

## Client
Maybe help us to understand this. The real incumbent is Microsoft Excel. If you were to guess, and I know it's just a guess, but of the whole market, maybe we'll just focus on midmarket and enterprise, but also curious to get your answer on SMB. What percentage of the market now and maybe even like three to five years from now do you think actually uses something like a Condor or Auxilius versus just doing this themselves in Excel?

## Expert
I see. I would say, there's always a 30%, 20%, and 50% breakdown as according to the discussion we have had in the scientific consortium on this. About 30% of companies in the SMB/mid-sized companies would tend to use a specialized tool like Condor or Auxilius. About 20% of companies are actually preferring to use a bigger brand. For example, Medidata or IQVIA. By the way, IQVIA is also a service/software combo.

For the larger 50%, they are either using homegrown Excel sheets or they maybe use Microsoft AI stuff. No matter what, those are not designated tools for scenario modeling or FP&#x26;A. There's a lot of customization here to make it work for invoicing, budgeting, forecasting.

## Client
Got it. Let's fast forward three years from now. Do you think that stays the same, or do those percentages change at all?

## Expert
We keep on seeing, I think, the use cases growing, but you also are having to take note that Microsoft is improving themselves too. Microsoft would have their own team now doing things and they have the Azure team. Largely, I would say you have 40% in three years, still keep on using Microsoft and associate tools. I would say for this larger 60%, you would have a 30/30 breakdown here, like half and half between the Auxilius, Condor, and likes versus the Medidata and likes.

## Client
You think the Medidata players are going to grow as compared to Auxilius or Condor.

## Expert
Medidata and other big companies, they keep on doing merger and acquisition activities you guys should pay attention to. They actually are aware of this niche market right now is for SMB, who may not even have tomorrow they care about right now. Whatever is a good starter, they use them. Also, their money is not from their own pocket. It's not from revenue, it's from the investors. The sensitivity to pricing is actually very low.

That's why I think for Medidata, they start to acquire companies in these categories. That's the main reason why they also will grow. The challenge, however, is for those companies, they sell their software as a suite. They are not a point solution. There's also a lot of resistance on customers buying from them because it's big money spent.

How hard would it be for IQVIA or something to build more like SMB midmarket tool like a Condor and Auxilius, or how hard would it be for Microsoft to target that SMB niche size, that midmarket by building more specialized [tools]? What sort of investment would they have?

## Expert
The answer would be it's relatively difficult because, first of all, it either requires some sort of internal team to support the use of Microsoft. I don't know if you guys ever do those tricks. It's a lot of things to learn. Also, there is, generally speaking, no formal training system. There are too many third-party trainings, but there's no formal training from Microsoft themselves on FP&#x26;A. It's like a self-trained type of stuff. You mostly learn your skills from maybe those communities, like Quora stuff, so it's hard.

Point solutions are easier for onboarding, for training, for even think about predicting the ROI. Microsoft is hard to predict ROI, which is why I would say for branding scenarios even if they acquire someone, they largely will keep their own brand. They won't necessarily integrate right away.

I would say, AI is a big wild card here. I think Microsoft has been investing so much in the LLM as well as predictive model. I think one thing is, generally speaking, still ethical ban today is to use AI for financial stuff. I know some companies are already doing this. I think that's something Auxilius or Condor are not tapping into right now. They're still very old-school in terms of the methodology. Maybe Microsoft can be a game-changer, a version of AI on this. However, if that becomes reality, we won't necessarily start to see life science industry taking on first.

Pharma companies and biotech companies were in a very highly regulated industry. It's probably the last industry we're going to see this. You will start to see those type of stuff from maybe fintech first, maybe IT.

## Client
On that note of the highly regulated industry, what sort of systems are you pulling or pushing information from?

## Expert
First of all, you have to be setting up a so-called AI ethical committee in a company itself. It can be a few million dollars down the drain because you have to hire people from internally and also from externally to act as layman to review each business use case, to make sure it's not unethical, including this one, a clinical finance platform.

If AI is being regulated in that way, you can imagine it's very limited in its actual value. Either it cannot access all the data in your company, or if they can, they cannot necessarily train their model using all these. That's the problem is why ChatGPT is so good, is because ChatGPT has this great data, a large amount of data being well-annotated. That's the problem for life science industry. It's so limited. Also, companies, they don't share data with each other. That's the reason why I would say it's both that bureaucratic reason, AI ethical use approval, as well as lacking of good data.

## Client
More for the vendors that you've evaluated, screened, and used like Auxilius or IQVIA or Greenphire, where are they pulling and pushing data from?

## Expert
They have data from their own because when it comes to a small company doing their own accruals and budgeting, it's not too complicated. It's more about getting different things in the right place, being auditable, and eventually, being able to forecast for their shareholders, so shareholders can keep on giving them money knowing they are not burning it through the budget. That's why it matters.

### Sean Doolan
They don't need AI to do that. Now, if you are growing bigger, you are opening in different countries, the scenario modeling is becoming important. Like I said before, Auxilius has scenario modeling, which is actually not too much based on AI. It's more based on statistics, I believe.

Based on AI, you have to have a model being trained by maybe tenfold or even hundredfold amount of data. That data definitely does not come from the customer company itself. It has to come from, for example, other customers, all in total train the system. That's the problem is Auxilius may not have that enough bandwidth or financial capability to do this training, which is why Microsoft could be a competitor in that space.

## Client
On that note of being auditable, can you speak a little bit to the regulations or changing compliance and audit expectations for clinical financial biopharma?

## Expert
Sure. There are two major governing bodies in the pharma space. One is SEC. It's only whenever you go to public, you want to go IPO, they have to audit your finance and everything, make sure you're not faking your financial, your tax return, stuff like that, which is pretty straightforward. For that part, you can use Auxilius.

For the fittings of purpose, they do better with biotech companies. They know better of all the money spending, all those gray areas too. Literally, sometimes there is direct spending, which is for the R&#x26;D. There's also indirect spending. For example, the CEO got a corner office or something like that. That's also spending, by the way, but it's sometimes okay. In those type of things, it's being taken care of by Auxilius.

The second basket, which is more to do with FDA auditing. Just because you are a clinical trial sponsor, you give money to the PI, principal investigator to run a trial, you have to be the legit business party. Those are

some relatively shallow level of auditing on your business from FDA, but they also want to take a look at your quality management system, make sure you're spending money on your quality, you're not cutting corners, stuff like that.

This is another area where Auxilius is able to help, is they actually are helping managing the contracts of different vendors like commercialization vendor, CROs. All the quality management system expense and returns, actually I will lay it for you. The two things, if you pass, you can go IPO first before you enter in your trial, or you can enter in a trial before you go IPO, doesn't matter, but these are the two major pieces that these accrual companies help you.

## Client
Got it. If you could, help us understand, or just confirm which departments interact with the software. I'm guessing it's obviously finance and clinical ops quality. Who are the users of Condor or Auxilius?

## Expert
You actually touched on all the three parties or the so-called super user in RFP. Procurement is oftentimes there whenever you're dealing with the vendor for the first time because procurement's function is to negotiate. However, the other function under CFO, called the financial planning, is also there because they are the FP&#x26;A owner. You also would have quality assurance team, quality, like you said. QA is there just because it comes to FDA inspection or auditing. That's QA responsibility.

You also would have the budget-centered people. The call center people who are the clinical trial team is their money. They have this call center coming from them. These four or five parties, they are with different ways, however, in voting, but they would actually run an RFP. They got the calls from different vendor. They plug those numbers back into their NPV model, the net present value model because NPV is aligned with their long-range planning of trial. For example, they are running 10 trials a year, until year three, they are running 20 trials, maybe by year five, they're running 100 trials.

All these are coming back down to as easy as how many users do they need out of, for example, Auxilius. From there, you have the proposal     Sean Doolan
from Auxilius telling you there's a volume-based discount. If you've got
over 100                              DO NOT COPY
users per year, you have this additional 50% for that additional users beyond 100%. Those are
things you can                        sd@virtuevc.com
plug in here. These are the denominator to tell you the cost. There's also this value part which
is nominator, which is based on the number of trials you can run and the value generated from each drug potentially eventually commercialized.

They also plot times the success rate. For example, drugs into phase I, there's 89% of chance to fail, for drug entering phase II, there's like 60%, stuff like that. All these numbers come back to say, "For year one, year three, year five, who is the winner, who's the runner up, who's the number three out of these proposals?"

This team eventually will, based on this presentation as well as the vote from the team members, based on the three or four KPCs, based on, I think, the business continuity, something to do with the reputation because they collect testimonials and recommendation letters, but also they got a sense of the, I would say, the modernization of the user interface, stuff like that, they collect the scores from the users during the demo. How do they like them? Depends on how many baby boomers you have versus millennials you have, the number can be very different.

Two things. One is the voting from the team, the other one is the NPV model are presented to CFO, CFO to decide which vendor to go with. CFO's mind is like, "Which year do I prioritize? Maybe I know, as a CFO, my company is going to be sold within two years of time, then I don't care about three years. Maybe let's prioritize on the one year model." Maybe in that case, Auxilius is the one to go. Most likely, for the three-year, it's going to be, for example, someone like Medidata because it's more scalable, or maybe their volume-based discounting works. That's how it works.

## Client
Okay. Say, were doing the same amount in revenue and profit, the financial profile looked the exact same for both Condor and Auxilius. If you had to put your money behind one of them, who would it be and why?

# Expert Insights on Auxilius and Condor

## Expert Commentary
If I, say, have $100, I would give $80 to Auxilius, $20 for Condor. I think the very rapid scaling of the revenue in 2023, almost 8X, that's a very big demonstration of how big the market can be and how far can it tap into the market in this SMB. This is actually very interesting because we all know that in 2020-2023, a lot of VC money are being retreated. Now, people have been rumoring about money coming back. I think that's not necessarily a very trustable thing until I see the number.

I think the revenue growth out of Auxilius is actually pointing to many of these start-up companies are coming back with money, strong backing from finance, and they do need someone to help them with budgeting and forecasting. That's it. That being said, I think Condor, like I said, like we talked about, they're more established. However, they don't have the advantage of quick scouting or plug-and-play type of Auxilius offerings. They're going to be a relatively smaller potential, I would say, tapping into the mid-range companies.

I do like their user interface. It's actually potentially tapping into something called a CTMS. If you use Condor interchangeably with Rave from Medidata, actually it's a pretty good combination. I was actually wondering more of if Condor can be merged with some bigger software company to be part of a very powerful suite. They have a very good customer base out there. It's just that it's not growing very steadily or fast. However, that is going to synergize with whatever Medidata or Veeva has been already hopped down. That's going to be what I see as, I give $20 for Condor with a lower potential.

## Client Inquiry
Is it longer implementation, or what's stopping them from moving quicker?

## Expert Response
They're having this integration with SAP, so-called the GL system. It's more focused on generating the real-time auditing trails. When you input anything, it literally takes a while for the numbers to show, even though more robust because it's automatic audit trail entries, real-time accruals, and the budget tracking. However, it's making things slower.

That's what, for example, PwC wants to do. PwC is all about auditing. PwC, EY, these companies actually are loving Condor because Condor is making their job of auditing much easier. However, if you care less about hiring a third-party like PwC to do the work of auditing, you care about, "Let's just get the work together. Let's have our investors look at my numbers here," is easy enough, then Auxilius is much quicker. It's fast implementation. It's also intuitive scenario modeling.

They can actually model some scenarios of things going extremely wrong. For example, if you're burning through your budget, you're doing all three things in your priority list, you may run out of money by 2025, something like that. Those are things which Condor does not tell you. Condor focus more on the real-time budget tracking, which is okay, but they don't do much as forecasting for the future, which maybe you don't need as much because you can always raise money from your stocks, for example, versus the Auxilius is more for the money you have reserved in the bank that's from the investors, different.

## Client Inquiry
I wanted to hear a little about biopharma, in general. Do you think it'll be moving more towards the Condor model, more towards the auditing piece? Will that become more important in the next few years, or do you think it'll be because there's so many that live and die of these biotech companies, is it just more important to be able to quickly pull together this information?

## Expert Response
It's a great question. In the past 20 years, you see a lot of start-up business model. They got money from VC and PE. They got less money from big pharma or bigger biotech. In the most recent five years, because of the COVID, many big pharma's pipeline has literally been barren, has been drained. Many of their trials were on pause, were literally canceled because the patients got COVID. That's very stupid to think about, but that's literally what happened.

They actually move their money around and be like, "Hey, let's just buy stuff." When they are now competing with VC and PE, pharma companies are really pain in the ass because they actually have a very comprehensive financial system themselves. They have actually a higher expectation than PE and VC. VC or PE, they send someone to the start-up company's board, and they can look at the financial every day. They'll be like, "I'm very happy," but the pharma company wants to have all the numbers out.

Actually, the interesting thing is we keep on seeing the pharma companies requesting some third-party usage like Condor to make things more visible because the CEO wants to just have a war room, where there are 20 monitors showing him or her all the numbers. That's actually a tailwind for the real-time tracking like a Condor. However, I think they also are looking for things like these so-called non-regret investments.

For pharma companies, they have a lot of money now. They are literally free to spend, but it's within, say, $5 million. It's even not necessarily more than $5 million. They want to make sure this money is spent towards small start-up where they can actually have maybe 10% of share, stuff like that. For this kind of investments, they want to have more consolidated accrual automation backup.

In that regard, pharma companies, they want to have non-regret investments. They want to have some sort of scenario modeling, and that's, obviously, Auxilius actually can help. I can tell you from my previous employer's experience, we showed that to DoD, we showed that to DARPA, even some government founders. Also, we showed that to pharma companies like Eli Lilly as well. They all worked out. That's not something that Condor can do.

You see, there are these bigger advantages or edge from Auxilius, where I think for this growing number of pharma investors, where they have money, yes, but they are so painful to deal with. I would say failure model or scenario modeling are actually going to work out better. However, if these companies grow to be bigger, Condor is the way to go.

**Client**
I was going to ask, how difficult is it to build something like the scenario modeling piece? How long would that take to build, or what sort of investment would be required? Why haven't.

That's a great question. I happen to work with some internal AI engineers on something like this. We have literally a GenAI engine internally, something called the OpenAI foundation. However, it's not very accurate. People would joke about this, "This is being wrong and very wrong every single time," because when we are getting there, it's never the same scenario.

I would say, Auxilius is more accurate because they are more based on statistics. Their intuitive scenario model is really based on their other customers' data. They have been dealing with more than, like I said, dozens of start-ups with some history back there. I would say, their data is better. If we are generating something our own, remember, I'm only going to use my own data. That's the problem is you need some sort of a broker to do this for you. Whether the broker have their own tool or you build your own tool, however, you have to hire someone to buy the data, which is impossible.

**Client**
Got it. The value is in the benchmarking across all data. This has been really helpful. We appreciate you indulging us with your knowledge on the space and the products. Have a great rest of your day.
