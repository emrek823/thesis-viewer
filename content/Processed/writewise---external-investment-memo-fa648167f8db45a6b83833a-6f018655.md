## Executive Summary
WriteWise, a managing general underwriter (MGU), is building a proprietary underwriting platform and offering a level-funded insurance product to carve-out specialty pharmacy spend for self-insured employers with an initial focus on the 500-5,000 member SMB market. Hari Sundram (CEO; 4x time founder with $6B+ in exits) is the prototypical founder we look for to build a business taking risk in the insurance space. Hari brings unique credibility from his previous companies in the underwriting space (Verikai, Radion) and trusted relationships with partners and employer clients to scale distribution from day one.

Employer-sponsored health insurance ($2.1T in premiums, covering 150M+ lives) has been described as the “tapeworm of American business” for years, but costs have reached a tipping point and recent regulations and policies (e.g., Transparency in Coverage Rule) are motivating employers to find new solutions in a challenging macro environment. Incumbent carriers and PBMs, however, are fundamentally unable to provide solutions that can truly reduce premiums because they drive margin through obfuscated pricing (drug rebates) and misaligned incentives (high admin fees).

To address the shortcomings of current underwriting offerings, WriteWise is creating a "pharmacy manual” (an actuarial benchmark) and then predicting future

spend for an employer group by leveraging internal and employer-specific data (census, election, historical rate, etc). WriteWise's approach can reduce employer premiums by 10-20% by more accurately underwriting risk and pricing that risk appropriately in a lower monthly premium. Initially, WriteWise is offering a level-funded insurance product to carve-out specialty pharmacy spend for employers to address their current acute need around rising specialty pharmacy costs ($375B by 2025). Over time, WriteWise can use this wedge in pharmacy to expand into medical services as well to fully transition employers from a fully-insured chassis.

Writewise partners with stop-loss carriers, transparent PBMs, captives, and brokers for distribution, and drives revenue through multiple high-margin revenue streams (ARR for underwriting fees, admin ARR based on pharmacy savings, insurance quota share revenue). The company's underwriting workflow is being codified today, and the team is finalizing key GTM partners to offer its product to its target employer clients (500 – 5,000 employees) towards the end of 2023.

**Virtue is excited to participate in this $5M round with $1M to support initial sales to 3-5 employers ($1M+ in ARR) over the next 18-24 months.**

WriteWise - External Investment Memo 3

Dr. Hari Sundram (CEO): Hari is the CEO and founder of Radion Health, the exclusive managing general agent for level-funded and medical stop loss from Great American Insurance Company. He is also the CEO and founder of Verikai, a predictive data and risk tool for insurance underwriters and brokers. Verikai was acquired for $170M by American Financial Group. Additionally, Hari helped found Auris Health, a medical robotics company that was later acquired by Johnson & Johnson for $6B.

Matt Levinson (COO): Matt was previously a partner at B Capital Group, a $6 billion AUM venture capital and growth equity platform, where he led the firm's investments in fintech and insuretech. Matt's notable investments in insuretech include Newfront, a leading tech-enabled benefits broker where he served as a Board Observer, as well as Emboker and WorldCover. Matt co-founded and was COO of NYC based drone technology start-up Aerobo and brings over a decade of experience after having been an investor or Board member in over 50 fintech/insurtech start-ups.

Nadav Mor (Chief of Staff): Nadav Mor is the Chief of Staff at WriteWise and previously Senior Staff UW at Radion Health. Radion had only one underwriter on staff for $25M of existing level-funded premium with loss ratios on net premium running at 68% on 15 months of experience. Previously, Nadav served in the Israeli Military.

## Market Overview: Why now?
**Unsustainable Employer Healthcare Costs.** The US group health insurance market covers 150M+ people in the US with $2.1T in annual premiums. Since 2012, the average premium for employers has increased 25% from $15.7K to $22.5K, a 40% increase relative to only 25% inflation. 35% of the market is fully-insured (more expensive - insurer takes on risk and admin) while the other 65% is self-funded (less expensive - employer takes on risk and admin). Employers are increasingly moving toward self-funded health plans in order to reduce costs and retain surplus.

**Market Downturn Driving More Interest in Self-funding.** During a high interest rate environment where companies are more focused on growth than managing spend, constant YoY increases for health premiums may be an overlooked line

WriteWise - External Investment Memo 4

item. Today, more employers are looking to bring unreasonable healthcare costs under control to improve their bottom line and compete for top talent.

**Growing Specialty Drug Costs.** Specialty drugs costs are expected to more than double from $162B in 2015 to $375B in 2025. Specialty drugs, often >$50k annually and taken for chronic conditions, make up 2% of total claims but 50% of total pharmacy spend. The rising cost of specialty drugs and growing specialty drug pipeline is causing employers to focus on cost containment strategies for specialty pharmacy, with 75% of employers actively looking for better strategies to reduce specialty drug spend.

**Increasing GLP-1 Utilization & Demand.** With 4/10 Americans defined as clinically obese it is no surprise that there has been a recent precipitous demand increase in GLP-1s, which have proven to lower body weight by ~15-30% for most users. Recent research suggests GLP-1 users also further benefit from a 20% reduction in risk of heart attack, stroke and cardiovascular deaths which, given the likely medical/cost benefit, may increasingly reduce payer's ability to not reimburse for GLP-1s. It seems likely that GLP-1s will become a mainstay drug — perhaps the most popular blockbuster drug in recent memory however employers will likely absorb increased cost-sharing of GLP-1 use. The ability to accurately predict GLP-1 utilization and cost for employers may further emphasize the role for WriteWise to support employer's GLP-1 cost burden.

**New Regulations Increasing Employers' Access to Data:** Recent regulations have the potential to reduce the structural advantages of fully insured carriers. The Consolidated Appropriations Act (CAA) of 2021 mandates employer access to the prices of health care services from carriers, giving employers greater accessibility to important insights into healthcare costs. The Transparency in Coverage Final Rule (effective 2023) requires improved health plan transparency for unit costs and opens the door for MGAs to get PBM formulary access at wholesale and direct contracts with provider networks.

**Employers Want to Understand the True Cost of Healthcare:** Kraft-Heinz recently sued Aetna for $1.3B in overpayments and failing to provide access to Heinz's own claims data, while the Bricklayer's Union in CT sued Elevance and the Massachusetts Laborers' Health and Welfare Fund sued BCBS MA for similar reasons. WriteWise is building a scalable underwriting platform to address these

WriteWise - External Investment Memo 5

same concerns and leverage increased employer interest in more transparent solutions.

## WriteWise Solution
The ultimate goal for underwriters is to accurately predict the future costs of group to price a premium that ensures certain loss-ratio (% of claims/premiums). WriteWise's initial differentiation is driven the team's experience and understanding of actuarial risk codified in their technology platform, but long-term differentiation is driven by success in taking risk.

We think of 3 main components of WriteWise's solution that allow the company to more accurately underwrite risk and offer an example to demonstrate the potential for 10-20% savings.

**Pharmacy manual ("the benchmark")** The pharmacy manual, or the internal WriteWise actuarial benchmark, was developed using data provided by claims clearinghouses (Change, IBM, Health Verity, Komodo) and Verikai. This data was then aggregated within age and gender buckets and scored to geography to account for network of the fill and industry. WriteWise is leveraging Ventegra (transparent PBM) for cost-plus pricing of alternatively sourced drugs, Intercept Rx's formulary for cost containment strategies (e.g., UM, prior auth) and then passes all rebates back to the premium holder. WriteWise can reprice the group based on the wholesale pricing data that they get from their PBM partners and use that as a baseline.

**Predicting Future Risk for a Specific Employer:** Once the producer (e.g., Crum & Foster) submits a group for carve-out, WriteWise takes in the census, election, status, the historical rate, and the renewal rate from each employer. WriteWise runs the proprietary pharmacy only manual on individuals without prescription history and re-prices to wholesale those individuals with prescription history. If the "Claims Plus score” (WriteWise internal scoring metric to get to aggregate attachment point) is greater than >1.1, then Rx can't be carved out. If the Claims Plus score is less than 1.1, then WriteWise prices in to a 110% aggregate. The Health Verity Overlay ("HV Overlay”) is to eliminate groups with members with extremely rare conditions.

**Insurance Product Offering:** WriteWise is marketing a Level Funded pharmacy product (Rx carveout) with PBM performance guarantees, but the exact product differs based on an employer's needs. Product 3 is the “fully-baked” version of Products 1 and 2, where Product 3 offers the highest potential savings for employers because WriteWise has more control. Product 4 is a generics only drug option either standalone or wrapped with MEC/MVC plans (gig or seasonal workers).

In a real-world example (table below), WriteWise looked at an employer with their current incumbent PBM pricing pharmacy at $27.5M. WriteWise can provide a lower cost solution by passing through rebates to the employer and sharing in clinical and Intercept Rx savings. This spread between the $27.5M incumbent cost and $15.3M total new cost (the “real price” and floor based on historical use) gives WriteWise room to drive margin. Because WriteWise is confident in their ability to predict future risk, they can get creative in how exactly these savings are passed on to the employer. They could offer a similar total cost of $27M and guarantee a percentage of saving or take full control of pharmacy spend and price the group at $23M to drive immediate cost-savings.

| **Incumbent PBM Cost**   | **$ 27,536,823.48** |
| Estimated Rebates        | $ (4,039,094.04)    |
| Clinical Savings         | $ (6,164,264.00)    |
| Intercept Rx Savings     | $ (3,822,037.26)    |
| Ventegra Admin Fees      | $ 1,811,166.15      |
| **Total New Cost**       | **$ 15,322,594.33** |

## Business Model
WriteWise drives revenue from 3 high-quality and sticky recurring revenue streams. The breakdown of how these different streams contribute to overall revenue mix over time is described in financials below.

WriteWise - External Investment Memo 8

The following describes the 3 revenue streams:

*   **RECURRING UNDERWRITING FEES**
    *   About 10% of premium
    *   Comparable company: Accelerant, valued over $2b and ~20x revenue
*   **RECURRING PHARMA ADMIN FEES**
    *   Priced PEPM (about $20). Recurring revenue
    *   Comparable company: Pareto Health, valued at $2.25b and > 10x revenue (2023, Warburg Pincus)
*   **INSURANCE INCOME**
    *   Via captive insurance entity sharing in risk. About 25% of WriteWise revenue at scale
    *   Comparable companies: large health insurance carriers like United or Centene, trading at 20-30x earnings (2023)

## GTM
WriteWise is partnering with NexTPA as its TPA, Ventegra as its transparent PBM, Intercept RX for pharmacy services, Axim for back-end IT admin, Crum & Foster as their producer, and talking with brokers, PBMs, captives, and other relevant partners looking to take risk in the space. This multi-faceted GTM approach expedites initial distribution and is only possible because WriteWise's underwriting platform is differentiated in market and provides value to all partners. PBMs drive more utilization by partnering with WriteWise, but don't want the liability that WriteWise is willing to take. Captive entities want to move more risk on to their books, and WriteWise enables that. Brokers are always looking for creative ways to sell more business to employer clients, and WriteWise gives them a unique offering in market.

```

The GTM focus initially is on 500 - 5,000 employee groups because these are groups the big 3 PBMs don't focus on and groups of this size typically have mis-assigned pharmacy risk (e.g., general assumption applied that pharmacy is 30% of overall medical cost). With these GTM relationships in place, WriteWise is working to offer its insurance product for the 2023 open enrollment seasons (starting November 1). Based on initial conversations, WriteWise can conservatively drive $300K in ARR per employer. With 51,148 employers in the 200 - 4,999 employee range, this represents an initial market opportunity for $15B+ from the pharmacy carve-out alone.

## Financials / Milestones
WriteWise's capital efficient model gives the company the opportunity to scale to $1M+ ARR over the next 18-24 months with 4-5 employer clients using the specialty pharmacy carve-out product alone.

**Financials:** Management has modeled out (below) expected growth of employer customers, 3 different revenue streams for the Rx carve-out (current solution) and level funded product for SMEs to transition them off a full-insured chassis (expansion).

Internally, we conservatively modeled out scenarios where WriteWise only offers its pharmacy carve-out product, employer growth is slower than expected (.25 -. 5 new employers per month), and key assumptions driving revenue for the Admin ARR (pharmacy cost savings per employee) and insurance quota share revenue are reduced. Even in the most conservative scenarios, the spread between historical pharmacy costs and the true risk of a group that WriteWise calculates ($12M+ difference in example above) is large enough to leave plenty of room for a healthy margin. WriteWise's COGS are only based on costs associated with gathering data, underwriting administration, and cloud hosting fees, so gross margins can scale from 60% to 80% over time with higher employer volume.

## Opportunities / Risks
### Opportunities
*   **Industry Veterans Focused on Product and Sales:** Navigating the complicated employer landscape and taking risk on tens of millions of dollars in annual premiums requires a nuanced approach. Sophisticated data analysis is necessary - but not sufficient - for building a large business in this space. Employers want to take risk with partners who have experience successfully managing this risk. The WriteWise team has codified their industry expertise

*   **Right Approach, Right Timing:** The spread ($12M+ in example above) between incumbent PBM costs and the total new cost WriteWise calculates (the floor based on unit cost) provides an immediate opportunity for arbitrage for a first-mover like WriteWise at a time when employers are looking for new solutions. Over time, WriteWise can utilize this wedge into pharmacy to further prove the team's underwriting ability, success in taking risk, and become the de-facto leader in market.
*   **Capital Efficient Business with Sticky, Recurring Revenue Streams:** Hari has a history of building capital efficient businesses (Verikai acquired for $170M after <$5M in funding) and WriteWise is no different. By focusing on the core underwriting platform, WriteWise can drive sticky, recurring revenue streams with 60-80% gross margins through a variety of business models. Importantly, they can also share in the cost-savings they generate without the financial or capital risk an insurance carrier would have (high capex).
*   **Expansion Beyond Pharmacy:** The market for the level funded pharmacy carve-out product is $15B+ alone, but WriteWise's initial wedge into pharmacy provides early integrations with partners and trusted relationships to land and expand into medical. WriteWise's product roadmap includes a level-funded product to help SME / mid-market business transition from a fully insured to self-insured chassis. This expansion unlocks massive markets with potential to capture the full premium dollar and not just in pharmacy.

### Risks
*   **Reliance on Ventegra PBM.** Ventegra is the only non profit PBM in the country which requires every drug manufacturer in the US, by federal mandate, to provide their wholesale price from production to them. WriteWise has established an exclusive partnership with Ventegra and through the Intercept program can integrate into any PBM to divert into wholesale pricing or can take over the entire PBM operation on a white-labled basis. This relationship is advantageous for initial GTM, but is a key risk as other for-profit transparent PBMs (CapitalRx, SmithRx) have struggled to drive sustainable profit margins with admin fees alone.

*   **GTM Timing (Readiness for 2023 Open Enrollment).** Writewise is planning to offer its insurance product for 2023 open enrollment in November, but is reliant on arrangements and partnerships with a variety of GTM partners. The team's previous relationships and strong value proposition give us confidence in meeting these timelines, but the reliance on external partners creates an additional complexity and risk for ultimate GTM timing.
*   **Employers Want Medical + Pharmacy Offering Initially.** As noted above, the eventual expansion to medical from pharmacy is an opportunity for WriteWise to capture more of the premium dollar. However, this approach is based on GTM staging where the specialty pharmacy carve-out is an important wedge in to a broader offering. If employers demand more than just a specialty pharmacy carve-out and want a more comprehensive offering, WriteWise will have to re-evaluate its internal product roadmap and work with additional GTM partners. The initial customer discovery from the team and opportunity to drive 10-20% cost-savings from pharmacy alone gives us confidence, but the balance of when, how, and why to expand to medical is a key consideration for long-term growth.
