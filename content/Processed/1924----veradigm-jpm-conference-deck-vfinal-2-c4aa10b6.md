## Slide 26: Non-GAAP Financial Measures

**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**

Veradigm reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. To supplement this information, Veradigm presents Adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which are considered non-GAAP financial measures under Section 101 of Regulation G under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The definitions of these non-GAAP financial measures are presented below:

*   **Adjusted EBITDA** is a non-GAAP financial measure and consists of GAAP net income/(loss) from continuing operations, and adjusts for: interest (income)/expense,net; other (income)/expense; depreciation and amortization; stock-based compensation expense; and transaction and other costs. Reconciliation to GAAP net income/(loss) from operations are found in Table 2 within this presentation.
*   **Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share** consist of non-GAAP net income, as defined below, divided by non-GAAP diluted weighted shares outstanding, as defined below, during the applicable period.
*   **Non-GAAP net income attributable to Veradigm Inc.** consists of GAAP net income/(loss) from continuing operations and adds back acquisition-related amortization; stock-based compensation expense; and transaction and other costs. Non-GAAP net income measure would also include a GAAP to non-GAAP tax rate alignment adjustment.
*   **Non-GAAP diluted weighted shares outstanding** consists of diluted weighted shares outstanding, as reported, less the dilutive impact of 0.875% convertible notes due to the intent to settle the principal in cash and shares to be delivered at settlement by the convertible note hedge.

Management also believes that non-GAAP diluted earnings per share and Adjusted EBITDA provide useful supplemental information to management and investors regarding the underlying performance of Veradigm's business operations. Acquisition-related amortization, stock-based compensation expense and transaction and other costs recorded in accordance with GAAP can make it difficult to make meaningful comparisons of the underlying operations of the business without considering the non-GAAP adjustments provided and discussed herein.

Management also uses this information internally for forecasting and budgeting, as it believes that these measures are indicative of core operating results. In addition, management may use non-GAAP diluted earnings per share and Adjusted EBITDA to measure achievement under Veradigm's stock and cash incentive compensation plans. Note, however, that non-GAAP diluted earnings per share and Adjusted EBITDA are performance measures only, and they do not provide any measure of cash flow or liquidity. Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with Veradigm's results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. Investors and potential investors are encouraged to review the definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures with GAAP financial measures contained within this presentation.

As noted above, the estimated non-GAAP financial measures and GAAP financial measures in this presentation are preliminary, and final results for fiscal year 2023 may change. These preliminary results are based upon our estimates and are subject to completion of our financial closing procedures. In addition, these preliminary results have not been audited by our independent registered public accounting firm. This summary of recent results is not a comprehensive statement of our financial results for fiscal 2023.

## Slide 27: Non-GAAP Financial Measures (Continued)

**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**

**Acquisition-Related Amortization.** Acquisition-related amortization expense is a non-cash expense arising primarily from the acquisition of intangible assets in connection with acquisitions or investments. Veradigm excludes acquisition-related amortization expense from non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income, and Adjusted EBITDA because it believes (i) the amount of such expenses in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of Veradigm business operations and (ii) such expenses can vary significantly between periods because of new acquisitions and full amortization of previously acquired intangible assets. Investors should note that the use of these intangible assets contributed to revenue in the periods presented and will contribute to future revenue generation, and the related amortization expense will recur in future periods.

**Stock-Based Compensation Expense.** Stock-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense arising from the grant of stock-based awards. Veradigm excludes stock-based compensation expense from non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income and Adjusted EBITDA because it believes (i) the amount of such expenses in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of Veradigm business operations and (ii) such expenses can vary significantly between periods as a result of the timing and valuation of grants of new stock-based awards, including grants in connection with acquisitions. Investors should note that stock-based compensation is a key incentive offered to employees whose efforts contributed to the operating results in the periods presented and are expected to contribute to operating results in future periods, and such expense will recur in future periods.

**Transaction and Other Costs.** Transaction and other costs relate to certain favorable and unfavorable legal settlements, investigations, restatement-related accounting and legal advisory services and other charges incurred in connection with activities that are considered not reflective of our core business. Veradigm excludes transaction and other costs, in whole or in part, from non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income and Adjusted EBITDA because it believes (i) the amount of such expenses in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of Veradigm business operations and (ii) such expenses can vary significantly between periods.

**Non-Cash Charges to Interest Expense and Other.** Non-cash charges to interest expense include the amortization of the fair value of the conversion option embedded in the 0.875% convertible notes issued by Veradigm during the fourth quarter of 2019. Other includes certain other income and expense and impairments on long-term investments.

**Tax Rate Alignment.** Tax rate alignment aligns the applicable period's effective tax rate to the expected annual non-GAAP effective tax rate.

(In millions, except earnings per share)

|                                     | Guidance issued September 18, 2023 | Variance        | Estimated Range January 10, 2024 |
| :---------------------------------- | :--------------------------------- | :-------------- | :------------------------------- |
| **Revenue (a)**                     | $615 - $635                        | ($7) - ($13)    | $608 - $622                      |
| **Adjusted EBITDA (b)**             | $160 - $170                        | ($35) - ($38)   | $122 - $135                      |
| **Non-GAAP Earnings per share (c)** | $0.80 - $0.90                      | ($0.01) - ($0.02) | $0.79 - $0.88                    |

a) Revenue variance reflects provider segment revenue shortfall. Estimated Range of revenue, on a GAAP basis, includes a favorable customer litigation settlement contributing approximately $16 million that reflects services provided over prior years.
b) Adjusted EBITDA variance reflects Revenue variance, certain favorable and unfavorable legal settlements, including the customer litigation settlement described above, and additional personnel expense accruals. The $16 million favorable customer litigation settlement and certain other legal settlements were previously reflected in the Company's Adjusted EBITDA guidance issued on September 18, 2023. The Company's exclusion of these items from its estimated range of Adjusted EBITDA is a change in the Company's policy regarding the presentation of this measure.
c) Non-GAAP Earnings per share variance reflects Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA variances, favorable upside in other income and interest income.
