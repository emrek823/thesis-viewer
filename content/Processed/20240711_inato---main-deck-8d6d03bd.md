**Building the**
**Marketplace for**
**Clinical Trials**

2024

**FASTCOMPANY**
**03-19-24 | MOST INNOVATIVE COMPANIES 2024**

**How this biotech company connects drugmakers with diverse clinical trial participants**

Inato's work with 10 of the top 30 pharma companies to bring diverse patients into their clinical trials make it one of the most innovative biotech companies of 2024.

## Slide 2: The biggest bottleneck in drug development is patient access.

**ACADEMIC SITES**
(Visual: A grid of 20 circles, with 1 highlighted in blue, representing academic sites)
**5% of sites do more than 70% of research**

**LESS THAN 5% OF PATIENTS PARTICIPATE IN CLINICAL TRIALS.**

**ONLY 4% OF TRIALS INCLUDE REPRESENTATIVE POPULATIONS.**

## Slide 3: Community sites are the gateway to accessing 90% of patients.

*   **→ 63%** Diverse Patient Enrollment\*\*

\*Performance of Inato sites vs. non-Inato sites
\*\*While there is no universally accepted definition of diverse, it is widely known that clinical trials are 85% white.

## Slide 7: Our 4,000 sites are aligned with sponsor needs.

**inato**

**→ Therapeutic Diversity:** broad range of therapeutic areas catering to a wide spectrum of medical research needs.
*   **1,562** Cardiovascular
*   **1,359** Neurology
*   **1,181** Oncology
*   **1,021** Immunology
\*Major Therapeutic Areas only - One site may cover several TAs

**→ Experienced Sites:** Inato sites have previous clinical trial experience, ensuring reliability and efficiency in trial execution.
*   **53%** <5 trials per year
*   **25%** 5-15 trials
*   **22%** 15+ trials

**→ Global Reach:** a significant global footprint and diverse patient pool.

| Region    | Percentage |
| :-------- | :--------- |
| Americas  | 65%        |
| Europe    | 20%        |
| Other geos | 15%        |

## Slide 8: More sites are using Inato, getting selected, ultimately speeding up trials.

marguerite.davis@foresitecapital.com

**75 Site NPS**

**Testimonials:**

*   **Mississippi Center for Advanced Medicine (2 Inato trials)**
    "We are 2 for 2 for studies that we have requested to participate in. Inato's help in presenting our site's information to sponsors is gold. It is doubtful that we would have been offered those studies on our own. Keep up the great work Inato!"
*   **Monroe Biomedical Research (6 Inato trials)**
    "Few companies actually focus on making the job easier for the sites."
*   **American Indian Clinical Trials Network (2 Inato trials)**
    "We operate in a medium-sized city (~ 75,000 citizens) in western South Dakota, and Inato matched us to a number of very interesting industry-funded trial opportunities that we would never have had the chance to consider, such as the mRNA RSV vaccine trial."
*   **International Research Associates (3 Inato trials)**
    "Inato's use of technology to provide trial information and gather meaningful feasibility data is far better than the rest of the industry"

---

**Key Metrics:**

*   Majority of sites now joining Inato through word of mouth.
*   # of sites selected for a trial per quarter grew from 5 in Q1-21 to 107 in Q1-24
*   Lead time to activation divided by 2 over the past 3 quarters through AI activation support

## Slide 10: Our pharma partners are committed to improving the ecosystem with us.

marguerite.davis@foresitecapital.com

**inato**

“The Inato marketplace is an innovative way to expand our site network and tap into different types of sites. Inato offers an opportunity to work with community-based researchers, which are not the typical sites that Sanofi works with.

These sites, on average, have fewer studies and less competition, which offers Sanofi the opportunity to accelerate enrollment. Additionally, working with community-based sites has been shown to increase the diversity of studies.

We believe this investment in community-based sites is critical to expand our reach and include different types of sites and diverse patients in our trials.”

**1. Patients enrolled**
*   **More patients enrolled, faster and more diverse**
    *   (Visual: People icons, 10 initially, then 20 with diverse colors)
    *   0 to 2,061 patients enrolled on Inato trials

**2. More trials on Inato**
*   3 to 74 active trials on Inato

**3. More sites join Inato**
*   0.5k to 4.0k sites on Inato

**4. Sites find a trial & start enrolling within weeks**
*   5 to 107 sites selected quarterly

(Grey text indicates: Q1-21 to Q1-24 growth)

## Slide 14: AI Matching to grow site selection.

marguerite.davis@foresitecapital.com

**inato**

**Reliability:** Site selection has traditionally relied on human experts, making it costly, lengthy, and often unreliable.

**Limitations of Traditional AI:** Efforts to automate this process using ML have failed because each trial is unique making past performance a weak predictor of future outcomes.

**Automating Matching:** LLMs make site selection scalable, objective, and reliable by analyzing trial and site data to assess site suitability for specific trials.

**Automating Data Verification:** LLMs can efficiently verify site-submitted data (CVs, certifications, FDA issues), outperforming human verification.

| Team composition      | Low    |

## Slide 15: AI Activation to speed up activation.

marguerite.davis@foresitecapital.com

**inato**

**Dependence on Email & Spreadsheets:** Activation involves dozens of stakeholders, hundreds of tasks, tracked manually through email & spreadsheets, leading to timelines ranging from 3 months to over a year.

**Failure of Project Management Solutions:** Traditional solutions have failed due to the additional overhead and conflicting SOPs across stakeholders. LLMs seamlessly integrate into existing workflows, bypassing these issues.

**Automating Activation:** LLMs can leverage data from emails and video calls to track progress, synthesize action items, and automatically resolve them.

## Slide 16: AI Patient Identification to grow enrollment.

marguerite.davis@foresitecapital.com

**inato**

**Reducing CRC Burden & Errors:** Current approaches require Clinical Research Coordinators (CRCs) to manually sift through patient charts, leading to a high workload, human error, and many missed patients.

**Zero-Shot Patient Matching:** LLMs can perform the two essential tasks for patient identification: translating the protocol's eligibility criteria into standard of care criteria and processing large volumes of structured and unstructured data to identify eligible patients.
(Source: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.0125)

**Adaptive search:** LLMs can adapt to each site's unique electronic systems, personalizing searches to match trial requirements and site-specific configurations
