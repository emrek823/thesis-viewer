## Slide 2: The Problem

PRISM.BIO | 2

THE PROBLEM
The status quo of document
management is tragic

*   Research organizations rely heavily on PDF documents and presentations, representing decades of investment and critical institutional knowledge.
*   Searching and analyzing this data within legacy file storage systems is time-consuming and manual. Our average client spent 15% of their week on these tasks pre-Prism.
*   This inefficiency leads to duplicative research, overlooked risks, and missed opportunities due to the inaccessibility of valuable knowledge embedded in document stockpiles.

## Slide 3: The Solution

PRISM.BIO | 3

THE SOLUTION
Prism's Knowledge Finder is
an easy-to-use, intelligent
research tool

*   Organize documents in minutes. Engage with them through intelligent search or chat. Deep learning models, vectorization, and LLMs deliver a search-and-chat experience that is fast and precise.
*   Knowledge Finder doesn't just find information – it prepares it for you, summarizing key findings, creating outlines, or formatting data for your next report or presentation.
*   Seamlessly handles any PDF or PowerPoint. Whether it's literature, market research, or an internal company presentation, unlock the full value of your library.

2. **Strengths and Limitations:**
    Discussion on the strengths and limitations of LLMs, emphasizing how they can amplify the quality and depth of qualitative research. The document also mentions a shift in ethical attitudes towards using ChatGPT and proposes future works to explore LLMs further ("Zhang 2023.pdf", Page 23 & 24).
3.  **Role Perception:**
    LLMs can be viewed both as sophisticated tools and collaborative entities in research scenarios. This dual role perception suggests a flexible approach in utilizing LLMs depending on the research needs ("Zhang 2023.pdf", Page 22).
4.  **Integration with Traditional Methods:**
    Combining natural language processing (NLP) with traditional qualitative research methods can expedite the analysis of unstructured data, enhancing outcomes while saving time and cost. This integration also allows for the identification of themes not captured by traditional methods alone ("Parker 2023.pdf", Page 1).

## Slide 7: Our Business Model

PRISM.BIO | 7

OUR BUSINESS MODEL
A B2B SaaS model with a strong
history of renewals and upsells

**Ideal client profile**
*   **Buyer:** Director-level in industry; principal investigators in academia.
*   **Company:** Medium-to-large pharma or academic institutions.
*   **Other:** Work in document-intensive, research-based role.

**Pricing model**
*   $2K/seat/year, with a limited free trial and enterprise pricing available as needed. Long-term, we expect to shift to usage-based pricing.

**GTM strategy**
*   Create an easy entry point for single power users, with eye on sales of $20-50K/year to individual groups within pharma and universities. Win MSA and sell on a group-by-group basis.

**Future growth opportunities**
*   We're focused on life science research initially, but our platform can be easily applied to other research-intensive verticals such as financial services, aerospace, defense, and manufacturing. We expect this will increase our TAM by 2-4x.
