### Fincura Company Overview & Product Strategy

- Tim Schuermer, founder with 10 years FinTech experience at OnDeck (Series A to post-IPO)
- Family background in privately owned dental/medical practices
- Building payments reconciliation starting with EFT-centric approach
	- Bank account as core source of truth/immutable layer
	- Plaid API connector sits on top of bank accounts
	- Listens for insurance payments hitting accounts, then solves EOB problem
- Strategic positioning: going deeper into fintech stack vs up RCM stack
	- Believes upper RCM will commoditize (normalized data, becomes distribution game)
	- Natural extension: insurance payments → patient payment collection → full AR/AP visibility
- Competing against “PDFs, pen and people” rather than other venture-backed companies
- Current customers: targeting 1.1M independently owned practices vs PE/hospital systems

### Business Model & ROI

- Pricing: 1.75% per location (example: 3-location dental group at $300K/month each = ~$50K ACV per location)
- ROI drivers for practices:
	- Productivity: replaces 1-1.5 FTE per site doing payments posting ($40-75K wage cost)
	- Float optimization: practices typically have only 1-2 weeks liquidity despite $3.5-10M revenues
- Explored pre-funding insurance claims concept
	- Different banks treat EFTs differently (Citi T+1, Wells Fargo T+3)
	- Provider price elasticity around 25-75 basis points for acceleration
	- Asset quality strong but pricing thin
	- Requires $100M+ facility to be compelling

### Go-to-Market & Funding

- Sales strategy: founder-led for next 24 months, targeting SMBs exclusively
- Distribution channels:
- Sales cycle: Monday call → Tuesday following week contract signed
- Target: 50-100M+ monthly payment processing, $500K-1M monthly revenue on seed alone
- Funding: just kicked off seed raise yesterday, looking for right partner not just capital
- Data room ready, flexible on timing (3 days to couple weeks acceptable)

### Next Steps

- Sean and Emre: internal huddle, respond end of week/early next week
- Potential second call (60 minutes) if first call successful
- Tim: available for async follow-ups, product demos, data room access
