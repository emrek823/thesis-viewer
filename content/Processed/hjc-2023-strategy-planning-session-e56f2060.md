Coincides nicely with continuation of Series A plan

We’re good for a while - raising Q2 2024

Asks: Anything in the market from other investors?

Brian: Mixed signals around updates and what’s important. Things are crazy right now so clarifying what is wrong/right. Updates were too heavy and too detailed. Focus on building the business. Quarterly updates. Working this weird in between Get the mix.

High-level 2023 planning - team is actively planning this week and last about what ‘23 looks like

Capacity to support 465 journeyers

Load balancing with scheduling with 5:1 problem

Half of the folks we brought on are doing this in addition to private practice

22 groups per week - 35 clinical contract hours per week

Pool of people to put in the group and we need to refill the funnel. We need more journey guides, the fluctuation is the same. As we get more journey guides, it will increase

Load balancing - time to work nights. Most of our therapists are gamers rn, but that’s not true for everybody

How do you hire great guides?

Interviewed 1500 people

4 step interview process (do they understand cbt? Do they understand community? Do they understand demo? Do free session and test?)

Jouneyers rank journey guides

Journey guides are quite deverse - men and AA women. The message of HJC are capturing people who are othered - including the therapists. That

It’s a really shitty place - tough supply market

Really high demand

Build network vs. caring about quality

High entitlement in times of what they think they deserve

People feel like they are joining a mission

Folks who do best -

Smooth onboarding

Activation- really around matching. Much fuzzier but we’re good doing it manually today. How do we customize?

Happen to cluster 26-29 SWE by accident, which is great. BUt we need to better categorize

Conversion - data on where they are dropping off and why

Near term - we need to get people in the program

ACquisition

75-80% retention after week 5

People have been with us for 11 months

How do we improve community?

Gamification

Other experiments we’re running

How do we improve journey guide experience?

Scaling

Raised our funding in August. Up until Mid-september / October. WE know have a team of 15-20 people

2 engineers full-time

Derek half-time

Full time recruiter

Full time community

Part time biz ops

9 journey guides

Time we cement the culture and values of the company

What is the most important thing for the business?

Can we get to a point where we get $1B in revenue and support at public side?

Cost efficiency and providing care in employer focused market. It’s really hard to throw off enough cash for it to make sense

5-6 years

Create a new market. How do we break this model as quickly as we can so we can start building that now

500 or 1300 Journeyer goals

Biggest bottleneck is hiring/recruiting. We’ve de-risked that already

If we can continue having a strong position in the market

Big issues are things that are going to come up when things

Things we don’t know

10/20K in a discord - can they support that?

Several thousands in ad spend

Data showing that sub-clinical is way to go

Community and discord

We did a good job of cultivating that relationship

Journeyers to community is high

Community providing value from new

Community ends up being the voice for what the program is,
