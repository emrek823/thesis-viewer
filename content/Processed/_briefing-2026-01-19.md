# SNF NewCo Pre-Call Brief

## 1. Quick Context

**WHO:** Pranav Garg (ex-VC in healthcare software/radiology AI, operator at MD Clarity serving PE-backed MSOs, recent AI agent company ops lead in Bay Area) and Rohan Dalvi (ex-McKinsey payers/providers, Vuma AI logistics startup deployment function). Both non-technical, met 5 months ago. George Easley intro from Outsiders Fund—George backed Dart at pre-product with 20-year-old founders, so he's comfortable with early/young teams.

**WHAT:** MDS coding automation for skilled nursing facilities. SNFs reject high-acuity patients despite higher reimbursement because they're not capturing full revenue due to MDS documentation gaps. Current solutions (in-house nurses or virtual MDS nurses) both flawed.

**WHERE:** Pre-product, pre-revenue. Using no-code tools (Lovable, Figma, Make) for validation. Targeting late spring/early summer 2026 raise. Need to finalize CTO hire and secure commercial validation pilot.

**PRIOR:** Two calls already happened today (Jan 19)—one with Sean, one with Emre. Team discussed backgrounds, market problem, expansion paths, and fundraising timeline. This is a follow-up call scheduled for Jan 22.

## 2. Market Context

**What we know from portfolio and theses:**

We've seen this exact wedge twice in the past 6 months. Flax (Trent Hazy, June 2025) is building MDS-3/PDPM reimbursement optimization and secured $9M in verbal commitments at a $15M cap with zero customers—backend just deployed. Their key insight: SNF stakeholders have different needs (clinical wants efficiency, billing wants accuracy, corporate wants CMI optimization), and some facilities pay up to $500K/person for patient referral staff with commission tied to CMI. Reap (Chaim, June 2025) is building SNF OS with deep PointClickCare integration, raised at $25M post with 3 design partners covering 37-40 facilities. Reap's base module is Medicaid eligibility automation at $299/month/facility, claiming 20x OpEx cost reduction. Neither is doing exactly what Pranav described—MDS coding specifically—but they're circling the same buyer and problem.

Our Home Health AI thesis validates the wedge strategy: "OASIS documentation complexity + messy narrative text creates 90% coding time savings opportunity." MDS is the SNF analog to OASIS—both CMS-mandated assessments driving reimbursement, both trapped in legacy infrastructure. The mechanism transfers. Our Healthcare AI Stack thesis adds the filter: "Healthcare AI moats come from three infrastructure layers—multi-EHR integration breadth, coding/billing ROI capture, and human-in-loop service delivery." PointClickCare dominates SNF EHR (~$10B company, $600M-$1B ARR per Reap's intel), so PCC integration is table stakes but not a moat. The question is whether SNF NewCo can build defensibility beyond connectors—Pranav mentioned "proprietary clinical rule-set" and "capturing accept/reject data" which sounds like the network effect play our CDI thesis describes (Cohere Health built 88-90% auto-approval rate on 12M PA requests).

**Market landscape:**

Competitors are raising aggressively. MedaSync raised ~$575K in August 2025 for AI-powered MDS management. Teton.ai secured $20M Series A in September 2025 for predictive elder care modeling. PreciseMDS offers EHR-integrated MDS software. Our pipeline call in December 2025 mentioned an "SNF rollup group exploring MDS opportunities"—so PE-backed consolidators are actively looking for solutions, which could be a distribution wedge. The market timing aligns with our research: healthcare AI adoption hit 22% in 2025 (7x YoY), coding/billing automation captured $450M in spend, and startups capture 85% of GenAI spend despite EHR incumbents bundling.

**How this deal fits:**

*Bull case:* Pranav and Rohan have the right operator backgrounds (MD Clarity worked with PE-backed MSOs, McKinsey payer/provider work, Vuma AI deployment experience). The $20B profit pool expansion claim (10-20% revenue increase per MDS patient) is plausible if MDS coding gaps are as widespread as they describe. PE-backed SNF rollups need standardized infrastructure across acquired facilities—that's a distribution wedge point solutions can't match. If they can build the "accept/reject data" flywheel on clinical rules before Flax or Reap expands into MDS specifically, they have a shot at the specialized moat our CDI thesis describes.

*Bear case:* This is a third entrant in a market where Flax has $9M committed and Reap has 40 facilities onboarding. Both are further along. Pranav and Rohan are non-technical and need to hire a CTO—execution risk is high. They're using no-code tools for validation, which works for discovery but doesn't demonstrate technical capability to build production MDS automation. The SNF market has brutal sales cycles (George's note on Dart mentioned "12-month procurement cycles with regional hospital systems"). PointClickCare could bundle MDS automation natively and kill the category. And the CDI bear cases apply: Abridge and Ambience are expanding aggressively into coding ($5.3B and $1.25B valuations), and while SNF is a different buyer, the "GPT accuracy improving" risk is real if foundation models get better at structured coding tasks.

## 3. Questions

**1. You've had two calls with us today—what's the one thing you want us to understand differently after this conversation?**
*Context: Sean and Emre already covered backgrounds, market problem, and expansion paths. This call should go deeper on something specific.*

**2. Flax raised $9M at $15M cap pre-product for MDS-3/PDPM optimization. Reap raised at $25M post with 40 facilities for SNF OS starting with Medicaid automation. What's your differentiated position relative to both?**
*Context: Both companies are further along and targeting the same buyer. Need to understand if SNF NewCo has a distinct wedge or is competing head-to-head.*

**3. Walk us through the MDS coding gap in more detail. What percentage of SNFs are leaving money on the table, and how much per facility per year?**
*Context: You mentioned $20B profit pool expansion. Flax found facilities paying $500K/person for patient referral staff tied to CMI. We need to understand the unit economics of the problem to assess the solution's value.*

**4. You mentioned building a "proprietary clinical rule-set" by capturing accept/reject data on recommendations. How many recommendations do you need to see before the rules become meaningfully better than off-the-shelf?**
*Context: Our CDI thesis shows Cohere Health built 88-90% auto-approval on 12M PA requests. That's the kind of data flywheel that creates defensibility. What's the SNF equivalent?*

**5. You're both non-technical and need to hire a CTO. What's your specific profile for that hire, and how far along are those conversations?**
*Context: Pre-product with no-code tools works for discovery but not for production MDS automation. The CTO hire is a gating factor for execution.*

**6. PointClickCare has a virtual monopoly in SNF EHR and built a Shopify-like partner network. Reap pays $30-40/month/facility for PCC access. What's your PCC strategy, and have you talked to them?**
*Context: Our Healthcare AI Stack thesis says integration depth is decisive. PCC integration is table stakes but also creates dependency—need to understand the commercial relationship.*

**7. Who specifically would sign a contract at a SNF—the MDS coordinator, the facility administrator, or someone at the corporate parent? Walk us through how that sale happens.**
*Context: Flax learned different stakeholders have different needs. Enterprise sales in SNF can take 12+ months per George's Dart experience. Need to understand the GTM motion.*

**8. What's your compliance strategy? MDS accuracy directly impacts PDPM reimbursement, and CMS audits are real. Flax explicitly prioritizes "precision over recall" because fraud risk can kill adoption.**
*Context: Our CDI thesis notes that clinical documentation AI faces existential compliance risk. How do you handle the accuracy/compliance tradeoff?*

**9. You mentioned expansion paths on earlier calls—can you rank order them by how soon you'd pursue and why?**
*Context: Today's calls mentioned home health, hospice, and other post-acute. Flax sees the same expansion opportunity. Need to understand sequencing and focus.*

**10. What's your fundraising target and timeline? Flax raised at $15M cap, Reap at $25M post. Where do you see yourselves, and what milestones would you hit before raising?**
*Context: You mentioned late spring/early summer 2026. Need to understand capital needs and milestones—pilot converting to paid plus pipeline per earlier call.*

**11. Have you talked to any PE-backed SNF rollup groups? Our December pipeline call mentioned one actively exploring MDS opportunities.**
*Context: PE consolidators could be a distribution wedge—they need standardized infrastructure across acquired facilities. This could accelerate GTM if you have those relationships.*

**Key thing to figure out:** Are Pranav and Rohan building something differentiated enough from Flax and Reap to justify backing a third entrant, or should we double down on one of the companies already further along?
