- Position is temporary, exploring potential business ideas with Travis as potential co-founder
- Similar structure to Bobby and Abby - Travis would be co-founder when raising pre-seed/seed round

### AI & Data Thesis

- Focus on using data in manual processes and automatically generated data to drive point solution adoption
- Key areas of interest:
	- Model adoption into regulated/critical industries
	- Human-in-the-loop workflows
	- Reinforcement learning applications
	- Bridging isolated Clinical Decision Support (CDS) systems
	- Addressing siloed data rights in RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) applications
	- Content rights aggregators selecting preferred partners

### Model Improvements & Evaluation

- OpenAI launching consulting business
- Model improvements will require:
	- Different evaluation criteria
	- Customer-specific status quo benchmarks
	- Context-specific training beyond generic tasks
- Cursor example:
	- Value derived from customer feedback
	- Reinforcement learning from successful queries
	- Building competitive moat through user data
- Challenge with risk adjustment: Companies with most data don’t want to build models
- Multiple winners possible in different verticals

### Healthcare Technology Perspective

- Physicians have historically used Clinical Decision Support tools
- Example of Aida Health:
	- Jake Plummer as Chief Commercial Officer
	- Diagnostic tool/symptom checker
	- Provides possible diagnosis list
	- Clear escalation paths (e.g., immediate hospital referral)
	- Focus on preventing missed diagnoses

### Shaper Capital Structure

### Additional Strategic Discussion

- Explored tech-enabled services and AI roll-ups
- Discussed venture vs. PE approaches to AI businesses
- Examined various healthcare data business models
- Considered regulatory and adoption challenges in healthcare
- Evaluated timing and market dynamics for AI integration
