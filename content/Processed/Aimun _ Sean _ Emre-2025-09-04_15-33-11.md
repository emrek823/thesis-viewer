### Multi-State Expansion Progress

- Indiana in process with Secretary of Health and Human Services
	- Federal government audited Indiana ABA claims
	- State creating working group to address spend and crack down on overutilization
	- Focus on long-tail home-based services, reorienting toward early intervention work
	- Secretary excited about Anna’s early intervention model that graduates kids to school system
- Minnesota scheduling site visit

### De Novo Market Entry Strategy

- Timeline pushed back but viable: Q2 instead of Q1 for new market entry
- Can’t parallel process real estate/hiring without license confirmation
- Still confident about entering new market next year
- Burn rate for de novo Indiana build: $5.6M including corporate overhead ($1M-1.5M)

### M&A Pipeline Assessment

- Strong acquisition opportunities emerging due to market dynamics
- Two acquisition archetypes identified:
	- Small BCBA-owned practices ($500K revenue, break-even/losing money)
		- Great clinical care but lack economies of scale
		- Struggling with billing, RCM, prior auth, scheduling
	- Mom-and-pop companies at minimum efficient scale
		- Generating cash flow but PE getting cold feet due to regulatory turmoil

### Small vs Large Acquisition Economics

- Small acquisitions ($250K-500K cost)
	- Buy $500K revenue generating ~$100K profit
	- Primarily buying go-to-market acceleration
	- Less valuable now that organic market entry is working
- Large acquisitions (7x EBITDA multiple)
	- Buying $20M revenue, $3M profit businesses
	- True roll-up play with platform arbitrage opportunity
	- Anna’s 40% contribution margin vs target’s 15% margin creates significant value

### AI Roll-Up Strategy Consideration

- Market opportunity for tech-enabled roll-up emerging
- Key value drivers:
	- Margin arbitrage (40% vs 15% contribution margins)
	- Multiple arbitrage (buying at 7x EBITDA, valued at 10x revenue)
	- Growth acceleration through proven playbook
- Roll-up strategies currently in vogue with investors
- Need 6+ months to prove AI margin uplift before credible fundraising
- Becky’s Optum/Landmark integration experience provides M&A execution capability

### Next Steps

- Continue parallel processing: organic expansion + M&A exploration
- Get under NDA with 3 companies (2 small, 1 large) for diligence
- Socialize strategy with friendly investors around November timeframe
- Connect with Will Johnson at Guide Health for capital markets insights
- Prove out AI margin expansion to earn credibility for roll-up narrative
