### 1 Ingest Claims Data

A minimum of 12 months of Claims Data is loaded into the
MavRx system. The data is reviewed and normalized
instantly, preparing it for analysis.

### 2 Historical "Reprice"

A historical reprice is conducted to determine "net"
historical cost after program and rebate savings. A
historical reprice is then provided for each option.

### 3 Predicted "Goprice"

The claims data is adjusted to reflect changes in
utilization, price inflation, and churn – "trend". Trend is
applied and a "Net Cost After Trend" value is created.

### 4 Expected Cost Calculation

The Net Cost After Trend value serves as Expected Cost
value. This value is unique to each of the PBM's evaluated
for a Plan Sponsors Rx Only Stop Loss coverage.

### 5 Aggregate Corridor Calculation

Adjustable aggregate corridors available with a benefit up
of up to $10m. Corridor is derived from the Net Cost After
Trend value, not from Gross Cost.

### 6 Stop Loss Premium

Stop Loss premium is calculated using a variety of
different factors including group size and credibility, as
well as PBM validation level (PCI Score 0-100).

## Slide 6: PMPM Guarantee Introduction

### PMPM Guarantee Introduction

**PMPM Guarantee Definition**

A contractual agreement between a PBM and Plan Sponsor
that sets a fixed amount, represented as a PMPM, as a
performance benchmark.

**Exclusions**
*   Covers all drugs, with few exceptions
*   Highest value to Plan Sponsor
*   Can be used by Plan Sponsor as a true budget

**Alignment**
*   A PMPM Guarantee aligns the interests of the PBM and Plan
    Sponsor by incentivizing the PBM to effectively manage the
    program by penalizing them if they do not.

**Underperformance**
PBM provides the Plan Sponsor with financial protection if
the costs exceed the benchmark. Assuming the difference
between the guarantee and actual performance. (eg $120)
*WriteWise will digitally perform the audit & reconciliation

**Accountability**
*   A PMPM Guarantee is the simplest and most effective way to
    hold a PBM accountable for their management of the plan.

**Certainty**
*   Budget certainty is provided to the Plan Sponsor by capping
    the plan's financial exposure.

**Evaluate**
*   A PMPM Guarantee is the simplest way to evaluate PBM's in a
    repricing or RFP exercise by reducing the impact of all other
    variables.

**Chart: PMPM Guarantee Underperformance Illustration**
(A line chart showing a benchmark line at $120, with actual performance exceeding it at $125 and $130, and under it at $115.)

| Value (PMPM) |
| :----------- |
| $115         |
| $120         |
| $125         |

## Slide 20: PMPM Guarantee Expected Claims Impact (PEPM)

### PMPM Guarantee Expected Claims Impact (PEPM)

**What is a PMPM Guarantee?**
*   Retrospective trend cap on PBM-based Rx (e.g.
    $80 PMPM; $128 PEPM)
*   If final net spend exceeds $80 PMPM (after
    discounts, rebates, etc) PBM reimburses plan
    sponsor
*   Plan Sponsor pays claims in real time,
    reconciliation occurs post-plan-year
*   Includes all drugs covered by the PBM contract
*   Excludes drugs run through the Medical (e.g.
    infusions)
*   Creates "Expected Rx" certainty

## Slide 24: Key Takeaways

### Key Takeaways

MGU's who adjust their pricing models can offer more competitive stop
loss quotes, decreasing Max Cost proposals by 5%-25%.

**PMPM Guarantees Shift how Rx Risk is Underwritten:**

Financial responsibility shift from MGU to PBM allows MGUs to de-rate
catastrophic Spec & Agg risk assumptions:
*   Rx cost certainty and PBM assumption of catastrophic risk allows
    MGUs to lower the Rx component of Spec Premium.

Cap on Rx spend decreases Rx claims factors:
*   Reduced Rx claims factors lead to a reduction in Agg Premium.
*   Allows MGUs to reduce the Rx corridor, allowing plan sponsor to
    significantly lower funding requirements.
