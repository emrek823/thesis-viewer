**Q: What is your experience in the space?**
A: I have spent almost a decade both running RCM teams and working at RCM vendors. I have done extensive research into most current RCM vendors both for my work as well as for RCM island. I helped to build the Adonis product suite, have worked with Stedi and Silna in multiple roles, and have vetting Brelium for two different roles. I have not yet worked with Camber or PhaseV.

## Client
Thanks for joining. I'm researching some of these next-gen mid-cycle RCM and just broader RCM automation vendors. I have your background in front of me, but maybe if you just give a quick overview of your roles at Adonis and the interaction you had with Stedi and Silna, that would be helpful.

## Expert
Yeah, absolutely. I have been working in the RCM space for just shy of eight years now. In doing that work, I did serve as the head of RCM at Adonis. During that time, I was responsible for overseeing the RCM operations team, as well as working with the product team and the development of product and the sales team and serving as a subject matter expert for sales calls when we would engage with our customers.

Outside of that, I worked at a few different digital health start-ups that have given me a unique insight into the different vendors that exist in the space. I've worked with Candid. I've worked with Silna. I've done sales pitches with Brellium. I've had a unique experience.

In addition to that, I have started an RCM-based community on LinkedIn. In doing so, I have found a unique opportunity to have some of these vendors even approach me to provide information to share with that community. I have a pretty wide breadth of who I have worked with and the different offerings I've seen.

## Client
Got it. Maybe just to start, I think what would be helpful for me to understand, I've spent a little bit of time looking at the incumbents in RCM, but it seems like Epic as an integrated EHR and RCM has the majority of the share, and then you have the outsourced services like the R1 or the Conifers of the world, and then you have Waystar which is software-first. Could you just lay out what does the current vendor landscape look like for RCM and where you see opportunity? There seems like there are so many point solutions now, new AI point solutions. Help me understand who dominates landscape today.

## Expert
Yeah, absolutely. I think it's important to understand that the different provider type is going to indicate who owns whatever specific landscape. You mentioned Epic. Cerner is another one who they own the hospital, the large health system share of the market, where they're most likely for those hospitals and large health systems going to be the EHR, as well as the RCM and billing vendor. They lock down integrations. They don't want anyone to come play in their software, and so they own that lion's share.

As you start to look at the non-health system, where you're looking at provider groups, you're looking at MSO, depending on size, you're looking at large digital health start-ups, that's where you're going to get into more of the Waystars. You're going to have instances where Waystar is a clearinghouse, as well as an RCM vendor, where they do have a UI that allows you to be able to submit and all of those pieces.

You have other players who are similar to Waystar, but maybe don't have the full feature set. You've got the Candid, you've got the Adonises, where they're not a clearinghouse, but they do offer billing functionality and they partner with a clearinghouse. When you move away from the hospital system side of things, you're going to look at clearinghouses being TriZetto, Availity, Office Ally, ClaimMD, Waystar, all of those folks. They're going to partner with other billing vendors that are going to take up more of the space.

You've got some folks who are dying off in the space. Tebra, formerly Kareo, they're not as large as they used to be. They used to be a really big vendor for small practices. They're not really doing as much with that anymore. You've got more of the hybrid solutions which I think is what people are trying to market and advocate for, where instead of coming in and offering a full end-to-end service from an RCM perspective, they're focusing exclusively on one area.

You've got the Anatomy Financial who are focused on payment reconciliation. You've got Silna who does prior authorization exclusively. You've got all of those different vendors who are just looking to solve a singular problem and hoping that you'll implement them into their tech stack.

## Client
Got it. In your opinion, looking at the existing landscape of vendors and where everyone plays in this red ocean, why do you think that these point solutions have a right to exist? I understand these companies are start-ups and maybe serving other digital health start-ups and maybe raising one or two rounds, but do you believe that these companies have a right to exist as a point solution just doing prior auth in this huge cycle that the customer already has vendor that does the whole stack? Just curious, why do you think that it makes sense to have a point solution here?

## Expert
Yeah. I think provider groups are more enabled than they've ever been to have their own product and engineering team. A lot of them are building their own things or doing things well on their own that they don't need a full end-to-end solution. There used to be a big problem pre-2012 where what would happen is a lot of providers would keep everything in-house or outsource absolutely everything to a vendor because there was no opportunity to do the things that they were good at or the things that they wanted their staff to focus on.

Where these point solutions get the right to exist is that they offer providers the freedom to continue to own the aspects of their function that they want to own, but have a solution for the aspects that they don't or that are distracting from their ability to provide care or are impacting their bottom line through poor experience from a revenue perspective.

## Client
What does that mean in practice? Are you saying that if you take a single health system as a customer, example, that health system, for some reason, wants to own everything except for prior authorization? Why would they want to do that? When you say, "Wants to own," that health system is not owning RCM. They're using R1 or Waystar to power their entire RCM function. Can you clarify what you mean by the owning things that they want to own?

## Expert
Yeah. I know of health systems who an use R1 from a services perspective, but maybe from a tech perspective, R1 is working out of their existing system as opposed to working within R1's existing system. The way I think about it is most of these vendors offer two things, software and services. Sometimes providers will engage in both. Sometimes they only care about one.

When you look at a health system, maybe they've got an EHR that they love that handles the aspects of the front-end RCM and they don't need that aspect covered by a vendor. They don't outsource that aspect, but they suck at prior authorization. They can't keep people in seats. The prior authorizations aren't getting done timely. They outsource it to improve their outcomes.

## Client
Got it. Maybe just going along with that example, for instance if a health system loves Epic as their front-end RCM, but then for whatever reason, they don't like Epic's prior auth module. Do you think that some of these new prior auth companies, is it hard to build what they're doing?

Right now, Epic doesn't have that, but Epic eventually will probably build out their own AI prior auth module is what I'm assuming, and probably offer it for free. Just curious, in your perspective or experiences, do you agree that that will probably happen in a couple years? What right to win does a point solution have over Epic when they eventually bundle that functionality in?

## Expert
I think one point is Epic will probably never give any customer anything for free from a module perspective. It's definitely something that though the payment may be bundled, they'll be paying for that prior auth. I think the point of where these point solutions have the right or the potential to win that business is one, the right now aspect. There are so many of these large vendors that offer end-to-end solutions that everything is on a backlog or a product roadmap that will eventually be gotten to, but you don't have a deadline or a time, and oftentimes, these providers need assistance with those services sooner rather than later.

I think the other piece is discipline is important. If your whole business is exclusively prior authorization, you're going to solve the problems within prior authorization that aren't necessarily as prevalent or on the same priority that Epic would take, but Silna has time because that's their entire business. You oftentimes see, with that improved focus, better outcomes because they're able to prioritize the needs of that singular function as opposed to being spread across all of the potential functions that they could offer.

## Client
For example, for a Silna, yes, they have improved focus on prior auth right now, so maybe they can deliver a better product today. Is the next five-year plan to just dominate prior authorization? Is that a big enough market? Do you have any sense of would these prior auth point solutions try to expand to be something bigger within revenue cycle?

## Expert
I don't know what Silna's product roadmap looks like or what their game plan is. If I were Silna, having worked at point solutions and other aspects of it, I would focus on the prior authorization vertical, and then as I continue to grow, look at adjacent aspects. We know prior authorization is a problem.

It wouldn't be unheard of to dive into referrals next given that it's the same type of idea, falls at the same point within the revenue cycle. I don't think that it would be fair to say that they're exclusively going to spend the next five years on prior authorization. That being said, I think the discipline and focus allows them to solve the problem before they move on to the next vertical.

## Client
Got it. For Silna in particular, out of the other prior auth providers as well, what is Silna's differentiator?

## Expert
I think the focus of where I've seen Silna perform better than the others is really around how they approach it. Many folks in the RCM space know that interoperability and prior authorization sucks, and that's a very crass way to put it. The reality is every payer requires a different process, requires you to log into a different portal, requires you to take all of these steps.

Silna isn't out there in the market promising this automated prior authorization process that doesn't exist because the interoperability is not there to support it. They're telling you, "This is prior authorization in a more organized fashion. This is prior authorization services where you'll be able to see the work we're doing, but you don't have to go and obtain that prior authorization in eight different portals on your own."

When you look at what's happening within the industry and the changes that are coming for prior authorization, one of the questions I directly asked the CEO of Silna when I met with him was, "What are you going to do when the FHIR API interoperability CMS final ruling is live?" They're already planning on what that's going to look like and how that's going to make changes for their business because of that specific dedicated focus exclusively to prior authorization.

## Client
Can you elaborate a little bit more on that, what their plan, and why? To give you background, I broadly know what FHIR is and I know that they're going to start trying to enforce that next year. It seems like enforcement is a TBD and don't know if they're going to actually enforce it. Why would that negatively or positively impact Silna's business? What does Silna have to do exactly in response?

## Expert
Yeah. The interoperability prior authorization final ruling that came out on January 1, 2024 is not required to be compliant until 2027. It says that payers need to be able to support the ability for providers to submit for prior authorization electronically and to be able to receive responses for prior authorization and to request if prior authorization is even required.

Now, this is just for Medicare and Medicaid payers. All of that being said, we've recently heard from a lot of commercial players that they plan to adopt this across their commercial plans as well. Where is this the make or break for Silna? It's easier for providers to obtain prior authorization. Why do they need a vendor to obtain prior authorization when they're now opening the floodgates and the ability to do this? The piece that's make or break and where it was really important to me for the CEO to be able to answer this question is who is the person building the product and the UI for the provider to be able to do that?

Was Silna looking at this as, "Okay. We're going to sunset our prior authorization business and move on to something else," or "We're going to use this as a launching point to say, 'Hey, we know this is required. We know you want to be able to do this. Come do that with us.'" That's really what I was grateful to hear from the Silna's CEO is that their game plan is to work to frame this as an opportunity for providers to have an easier time to request that prior authorization.

## Client
What exactly is Silna trying to enable? The rule that providers and payers need to be able to submit prior authorization electronically, is the idea that Silna has to change their product to enable that, or does Silna's product already enable that? Sorry if it's obvious, I just don't fully understand.

## Expert
No, you're good. Apologies for not providing better context there. Right now, they can't electronically submit. Everything's being done through payer portals, which feels like a form of electronic submission, but it's often like uploading forms. What will happen is providers will now need a vendor of some kind that can support the use of FHIR APIs to request if prior auth is required, submit the prior authorization if it is, and receive the prior authorization response. Having a vendor that allows them to do that is the important piece so providers don't have to build that themselves.

## Client
What kind of vendors exist to be able to translate? I don't know exactly what that vendor would be. Is that like a Health Gorilla or like a Particle Health? What exactly is the vendor that you're describing doing?

## Expert
Ultimately, it's going to be a vendor that's able to support a UX around the API responses. How are you making API calls? What clearinghouse are you using to do that? Are you doing it in the right format, which the FHIR API interoperability format is a newer format to the RCM space?

## Client
In the absence of a third-party vendors, what would a provider do? The provider would just figure it out themselves?

## Expert
They may need to hire engineers to build it. Some EHR systems talked about how they want to make it available to their customers that use it, "This is your door you're opening for Epic to begin supporting prior authorization because we know this is going to be required and available to them."

## Client
Got it. What's stopping Epic from using that as a catalyst to go into prior auth?

## Expert
Prior auth is also not Epic's entire business.

## Client
My understanding of the broader FHIR mandate, I forget, it's maybe 20th Century Cures Act or maybe it's not exactly that one, there's one where everyone needs to be able to support FHIR APIs starting in next year or something like that, but nobody thinks that it'll actually be enforced. I don't know if you know what I'm referring to, but how is that enforceability different in that rule versus this one?

## Expert
I think because the enforcement of this begins a year following the FHIR API enforcement, they've already stated that they're enforcing the FHIR API, so whatever interoperability rulings come after the fact should be leveraging the FHIR API. I think the place where we're going to see greater enforcement from the prior authorization standpoint is because that's the way that the payers are building it out. Other formats of API are not going to be accepted.

The problem is that other instances of sending information to and from payers with API has traditionally been done in a different format and already exists. I think that's where the acceptance and adherence and enforcement to the FHIR API, as opposed to prior authorization via FHIR API, are going to be different from each other.

## Client
That makes sense. I forget what it's called, but it's C-something?

## Expert
Yes.

## Client
That's a key distinction. Is it right that, currently, prior authorization, there isn't really a data interop solution or a language or format, whatever? Right now, it's just people submitting in every single individual payer portal.

## Expert
Exactly.

## Client
Got it. How do you feel about Silna's positioning? Who are the other main prior auth competitors that Silna is mostly facing off against?

## Expert
The only other person I've seen in the space or heard anything of was, for a moment, Adonis had offered prior authorization, but they had decided to not continue offering that. I haven't really heard of other vendors in this space, so I can't really speak to Silna's positioning against their potential competition.

## Client
Have you heard of Autonomize? I believe Autonomize does prior authorization.

## Expert
The name sounds familiar, but I haven't done enough research to know what their model looks like.

## Client
Got it. I think Canberra is maybe another one, Mandolin. Maybe moving on from Silna, more generally, when you think about the full RCM stack, from front end to back end, where are the areas of opportunity for start-ups, and why?

## Expert
Yeah. I think it's tough, and I will explain why. Please let me know if you don't feel like I have enough context. I think the hard part is if you split the cycle into three different places. You have front-cycle activities, those are going to be your eligibility checks, your prior authorization, your referrals, your patient qualification and patient intake. Those are all super automatable. There's a ton of support from an interoperability perspective.

Where I think that there is less opportunity is they are saturated. You could trip over someone that offers you some kind of eligibility verification. You could trip over somebody that offers patient onboarding and intake and the forms and supportive management of those. It's been done. It doesn't feel like there is much opportunity there and available.

As you move into mid-cycle, this is where claim creation exists. This is where claim submission, claim scrubbing, engaging with the clearinghouse and sending to the payer, all of that happens. The automation opportunity is slightly less. You've got some folks that are using provider documentation and AI to be able to populate claims so that you don't have to have a person fill out a claims form. That's been said and done and that's working well.

You've got claim scrubbers, which I don't think there's really any vendors that exclusively do claim scrubbing because they are such a large part of the clearinghouse and EHR itself. There's really not a ton of opportunity there. As you move into the back end, this is where you have AR and denials work, payment posting, payment reconciliation, patient collections, all of those pieces.

There is a ton of opportunity because nobody wants to touch it and nobody wants to touch it because there is very limited opportunity for automation in this area. It's tough because the least saturated aspect of the RCM cycle is also the most difficult and least automatable.

## Client
Can you elaborate on what do you mean limited opportunity for automation? What do you mean by that?

## Expert
Yeah. There are two ways I think about this. One is what is the opportunity to leverage AI to be able to support this and what is the opportunity to just outright automate it? When we look at AI, the difficulty of where it doesn't help as much with back-end activities, think working denials, working AR, payment reconciliation, these are activities that are hard for human beings because insurance plans are sending back very limited, very obscure information that requires problem solving, research and expertise to be able to answer.

People don't do this well. AI can't do this well because who is going to train an ML model? Who is going to show a bot what needs to be done if there are very few repeated tasks or activities, or if those activities are reliant on individual patients? Does that make sense?

## Client
Yeah. It sounds like you don't think that there's anywhere that's a good opportunity for start-ups. Is that the right way?

## Expert
Yeah, a little bit. I think it's saturated. I think everybody and their brother looked at healthcare and saw that it didn't get shut down with the pandemic, and suddenly, 95 million, which is absolutely hyperbole, but you had a large volume of these health tech companies that came out of the woodworks or vendors in support of healthcare that are truthfully starting in the space because it didn't get shut down with COVID. It was an industry that wasn't financially harmed in that process.

I think the place of opportunity is going to be more so on the compliance side. How are you helping folks maintain compliance now that things like allowances and the public health emergency are over? How are you keeping them up to date on those pieces and coding changes? I think there's opportunity for things that sit on top of RCM, but when we look at the true day-to-day activities within the health tech space from an RCM perspective, there's a lot of people doing it and there's limited opportunity for some aspects of it.

## Client
Got it. The reason I want to push on this, just curious because you obviously spend time at Adonis and then you mentioned that you think there's a big opportunity with Silna. How do I reconcile what you said about Silna in particular to how you feel about the areas of opportunity in RCM? Prior auth is probably mid-cycle?

## Expert
Prior auth is front cycle.

## Client
On the front end, you said it's saturated, lots of different vendors. Is that how you feel about Silna, for example? You think it's hard for them to really keep maybe limited opportunities then?

## Expert
I think you're right to question that. I think to better speak to what I was sharing of, clearly, I have learned a lot about Silna's model. I have not learned a lot about other folks in the prior authorization space. Prior authorization is one of those areas that is very difficult to automate because there isn't the interoperability there yet.

Now, that being said, I should have been more clear on it's saturated aspect of that is really focused around the benefits and eligibility verification aspect. You've got Nirvana. You've got Stedi. You've got every single clearinghouse that offers some type of eligibility tool. You've got Availity. You have all of these different providers who already have large share within the market from an eligibility perspective, where I think, if I were to start a start-up right now, I probably wouldn't aim for eligibility.

## Client
Got it. When you were mentioning the compliance side, like coding change, I think you said, can you just elaborate on what exactly you mean? What are the platforms that sit on top of RCM?

## Expert
Yeah. I think that's where we start to get into more of business analytics dashboards, coding, auditing, those types of things, where those I don't view as necessarily part of the RCM. You can absolutely function without those, but those are tools that enable you to make changes to improve your RCM function.

When we look at coding, for example, you've got a few different vendors out there right now who they offer recommendations for provider documentation to improve the likelihood of reimbursement. That's one. You also have ones where they'll do preemptive audits to see if you would pass the payer audit, those types of things.

You also have, as I shared previously, business analytics dashboards. Adonis has their Adonis Intelligence where it's sitting on top of all of your data. It's not moving information into or out of the system, but it is providing you with feedback and recommendations within their specific software of what you can do to make improvements.

## Client
Got it. Maybe going to Adonis, given that you spent some time there, I know a little bit about business, but how would you compare Adonis positioning-wise? My understanding is they're like an observability platform almost. They try to identify the potential denials and they try to go fix that, and now they have agents to go fix that for. How would you evaluate Adonis' value proposition and product capabilities as it compares to some of their direct competitors? One direct competitor is on the start-up side, maybe a Candid, and then two, to some of these bigger software, like an Epic's RCM or a Waystar RCM.

## Expert
Yeah, absolutely. I think the piece with Adonis is, as you shared, it's like an observer-type piece, where there's no embedded workflows, there's no connection for actions that are taken within the Adonis platform to then reflect in the customer. I think Adonis, as you shared, they're like an observer system where any action you take in the Adonis platform does not reflect in the EHR or the clearinghouse or anything of that nature. It's a great tool, but it is separate from your existing tech stack. It is another piece that is added on. I think the piece that differentiates them from others like Candid or Apero or other competitors, at least that I was aware of while I was there, is their insights are so much more specific to how do they forensically get to the next step and make recommendations. I've worked in Apero. I've worked in Candid. Oftentimes, when I see data in those systems, it's just the data. It's, "Here's your AI or bucket, here's your denials, go do what you want with them."

With the Adonis platform, they're highlighting that same information and making recommendation and providing alerts. I don't have to have the same level of expertise when I'm looking at that data in Adonis because it's already done that first instance of legwork for me of alerting me to a potential problem or pattern and making a recommendation depending on what type of problem or pattern has been identified. While it's not an embedded workflow, it does provide you that next step to make it just that much easier to take the next action that needs to occur in solving the problem.

## Client
Got it. Maybe also just stepping back, coming back to where you see opportunities, I know you spend most of your time in RCM, it seems like, within some of these newer health tech platforms, if you were to pick a couple or maybe one or two, what are the companies that you think are more interesting and have more opportunity?

## Expert
Yeah. I think going through it for the different focuses. From a claims billing and submission perspective, I really like Candid. Billing out of their platform is super straightforward. From a data and reporting perspective, I don't care for it. I'm trying to gather my thoughts here. When you look at companies like this, ultimately, what you're doing is you're piecing together those point solutions. I don't have a vendor that is end-to-end complete that I love.

I think a lot of people that use Epic are held hostage to Epic because it is incredibly expensive to implement and it is incredibly difficult to move off of. A lot of the folks that say, "Epic is your end-to-end, it does everything," it does, but not all of it very well and it's very hard to leave once you're on there.

## Client
Looking at it, I know you had asked earlier around what right do these point solutions have, I think it creates that level of flexibility that, me, if I was a provider group or a health system, it allows me to solve the problems with the best of what worked and not have to put up with the bullshit of the things that don't.

## Expert
Makes sense. Do you think that there is a roadmap to somebody becoming that end-to-end complete, that is truly modern and easy to use? What do you think is the best wedge for a platform that might be able do that as a new entrant?

## Expert
Yeah, I think the piece for a new entrant that's going to be important is being patient and disciplined and focusing on a singular vertical at a time. I think that there are definitely some promising folks in the space right now that though they are focused on small problems, they have a potential pathway to solving more than exclusively the problem that they're working on.

I think one of the things that I've seen happen for folks who haven't been successful is they're getting distracted by trying to do it all. There are so many jobs to be done in RCM. We've literally mapped them for RCM Island. There's 89 of them. It's something that when you look at these different jobs to be done, if you're trying to solve all of them, you're not going to do any of them well.

## Client
It's hard because most venture capital firms, PE firms, they want to see results and growth quickly. In terms of someone being able to step up and be that end-to-end solution, they need to focus and solve a problem, do it well repeatedly, and then move on to the next.

## Client
Makes sense. I know you mentioned you would work with Stedi and Brellium. My understanding of Stedi, to start off, is that they're like the next-gen clearinghouse and they seem to be the clearinghouse that the Adonises will use. Just curious, what do you see is the main strengths or weaknesses of Stedi and their positioning in the market? Do you think that they are going to be able to replace or exceed some of these legacy clearinghouses, or are they more so a solution for start-ups? Your general views there would be helpful.

## Expert
Yeah. Definitely, in the space of right now, a great solution for start-up, I think they're a little bit too hacky for a larger, more mature hospital or health system. I say that because until a few months ago, they didn't even have a UI. Everything was API-based. Oftentimes, that's not something that's viewed as a positive within the health system space or the hospital space. They want tools that their teams can actively use and engage in.

I think the piece that separates Stedi from the others is their direct focus on establishing direct payer connections. They work across the different clearinghouse spectrum. They engage with other clearinghouses and partner with them to ensure that there's limited downtime of their ability to send and receive claims or eligibility information.

I think the founder, if I remember correctly, had originally started with EDI, which is the basis of everything you do in eligibility and was incredibly successful in that. It's very clear, understandable story and progression of what they were doing with their business. I think all of that has been very much a positive, especially following the Change Healthcare outage. They were able to onboard so many people so quickly and they've had pretty consistent response times and uptime and quality that a lot of folks have adopted them and really liked them and a large volume of their sales has been word of mouth.

## Client
Got it. I'm sorry. I don't understand a little bit. What exactly is the direct payer connection? What is the purpose of that? Why is the fact that they started with EDI so relevant?

## Expert
Yeah. They started with EDI parsing, which means that they were helping and supporting other businesses with reading and understanding what EDI responses were so that they could build them into platforms. They're very familiar with the technical language required for eligibility and for claim submission. What that does for them is they know exactly what needs to happen.

One of my favorite questions to ask a clearinghouse is what is your EDI enrollment process? EDI enrollment, electronic data interchange, is the unlock to be able to submit claims and receive claims information electronically. You cannot have multiple EDI enrollments live at a single time. You can only have one per payer. When your clearinghouse goes down, you have to then do a completely new EDI enrollment to be able to work with another clearinghouse.

Where the direct payer integration is incredibly useful is that in the event there were another Change Healthcare outage, Stedi's ability to send and receive information from the payer is not impacted by a third party. As long as they have the integration with the payer, they can send and receive that information whenever they want to.

## Client
I'm a little confused. What other third party does Stedi need to rely on? I thought Stedi is the third party, like they are the clearinghouse.

## Expert
You would love to think that, but unfortunately, no. A lot of clearinghouses are wraps of clearinghouses. There were other clearinghouses that went down when Change Healthcare went out because there are payers who they have an exclusivity contract with Change Healthcare. What happens is regardless of the clearinghouse that your billing system uses, that clearinghouse has to send to the exclusive clearinghouse of that payer. With Stedi making the effort to go out and establish those direct payer connections and get around the exclusivity contracts that exist, they then prevent that from being their reality.

## Client
Got it. If it's an exclusivity contract, how do you get around it?

## Expert
Renegotiation. I know the person who does payer partnerships over at Stedi. We've had conversations because I really pressed on this before we used them. The piece that she had shared is that they often, when it comes to establishing their direct payer connections, treat it like a sales process and it takes sometimes up to a year for them to be able to establish that because of potential necessary renegotiations that are required.

## Client
Got it. How do you feel about Stedi's positioning as a next-gen API-first clearinghouse? I guess clearinghouse is not really part of RCM from a front, middle, back-end cycle. I don't know. Do you see any opportunity in that space? Do you feel like Stedi is well positioned?

## Expert
I think Stedi is probably better positioned than anybody I've seen in the space. The thing is, because of their extensive knowledge of EDI and how it works, they're trying to address the issues that exist with EDI to allow for more uptime of their clearinghouse. I think that approach is the piece that differentiates them. Going back to it, though, they're super exciting to start-ups right now, not so exciting to hospitals and health systems. It truly depends on what market are you looking at for them to be a viable or non-viable option for.

## Client
Yeah. If the only thing is the UI, is there anything else that you think stops them from being exciting to hospitals?

## Expert
No, I really think it's the UI. I laugh when folks are like, "Oh yeah, they're API-first." I'm like, "They're API exclusively," which if you don't have a product or engineering team, it's not helpful.

## Client
Most large health systems, they obviously have a clearinghouse. All health systems have a clearinghouse. My understanding is you can have multiple clearinghouses, but what is the pull to have another clearinghouse is a start-up? What is so good about Stedi for a health system, assuming they're able to build a UI?

## Expert
Yeah. I think the important piece is Stedi is filling the need or addressing the problem of the clearinghouse need from an eligibility perspective almost exclusively. I don't know that they're processing claims, or they may have just started in processing claims, but their focus is really on the eligibility aspect.

When we go back to revisit, earlier in the conversation, you had shared what place did these point solutions have, they're a point solution. Yes, they are API-first, and that's not quite as attractive to a hospital or a health system. They're also a point solution. Epic has an eligibility function. Cerner has an eligibility function. They're likely already paying for those.

## Client
I don't think I fully understand what you mean by only eligibility. My understanding of the clearinghouse is that they not only check and translate, and then also route the claims. Are you saying that Stedi is only doing the checking aspect, only checking the eligibility part? Do they just send it to a different clearinghouse to do the other parts of what a clearinghouse does?

## Expert
When you have EDI enrollment, there are four types of EDI enrollment that have to be completed. You have eligibility, you have claim submission, you have claim status, and you have claim remittance. If you have professional versus institutional claims, you may need to do even more.

With the EDI enrollment, the clearinghouse that you use for eligibility is not always going to be the same clearinghouse that you use when you are submitting claims. Every engagement that I've had with Stedi has exclusively been for their eligibility API. I haven't used them to submit claims. I vaguely remember hearing rumblings that they're capable of doing that, but I haven't experienced that with them.

## Client
I was going to ask, what do you use for the other stuff, for the claim submit, status, remit?

## Expert
Oftentimes, it's going to depend on which system you're billing out of. You can have a system that is your clearinghouse, your EHR, your billing platform, all of those things. That's going to be your Epics and your Cerners. You can have some that are just billing platform and just clearinghouse. That's going to be your Waystars. You can have some that are just billing platform, that's going to be your Candids. It's going to depend on what your tech stack looks like will decide ultimately what clearinghouse you use.

Different EHRs and different billing systems have different already-established relationships with clearinghouses. When you onboard to a new billing system or a new EHR, you may have to complete EDI enrollment to be able to submit claims through that system depending on it. For example, ModMed, they use TriZetto almost exclusively. Pyratech, they use Office Ally. eClinical Works will either use TriZetto or Office Ally. It really just depends on which system you're working in will determine which clearinghouse your claims are being [processed].

## Client
If a start-up was already using ModMed or whatever, why would they go out of their way to adopt Stedi as well?

## Expert
Because their eligibility tool sucks. Their claims are getting submitted, but they're not getting good information back for eligibility checks. They go and seek a different vendor so they can get better information. That's where the point solutions come back to being valuable is you're not stuck with a module with this larger group that isn't performing the way you need it to.

## Client
Got it. Maybe just to finish off, I know you mentioned you worked a little bit with Brellium. That one, I think my understanding, is checking the patient charts against payer rules and documentation guidelines. Is that what you were talking about in terms of the compliance platforms? I don't know. Who are Brellium's main competitors? How does their competitive landscape look?

## Expert
Brellium is a tough one for me because I often use them as the example of they put the marketing Band-Aid that says AI and they promise these outcomes, but the reality of the situation is that in order to, in a HIPAA-compliant method, obtain enough data to be able to feed the model with your own data, you need hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of data points to be able to get strong insights that state, "If you document this way, you will be paid better."

I'm not the biggest fan of Brellium right now or the other competitors in the space because I think right now, they're leveraging the AI buzzword, but not providing clear indication to potential customers of the data requirements necessary to see the return on investment and how long it will take to get there.

## Client
Got it. Who are the other ones in the space?

## Expert
That is a great question. I don't have that list saved on this computer so I don't have that answer off the top of my head.

## Client
No worries. I think those are all questions that I had. I appreciate the time. This was super helpful.
