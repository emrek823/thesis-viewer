## Slide 7: Problem: Limited Demand, High Overhead

Problem: Limited Demand, High Overhead

Serving the Long-Tail of Requestor is **Hard**

*   **Limited Demand**
    Managing the longtail of Requestors adds admin burden and compliance risk—with little return.
*   **High Tech Burden**
    Most Requestors can't implement your APIs, let alone work across multiple vendors.
*   **Lack of Standardization**
    Every request is different—making intake automation tough and scaling expensive.

**Chart: Record Requests vs Customers (Long Tail Distribution)**

This chart depicts a typical long-tail distribution where a small number of customers generate a high volume of record requests, while a large number of customers generate a limited volume of requests.

*   **X-axis:** Customers
*   **Y-axis:** Record Requests
*   **Shape:** A curve starting high on the Y-axis and rapidly decreasing as it extends along the X-axis, illustrating that few customers have high requests, and many customers have low requests.

## Slide 8: Solution: Hermes Unity Platform

Solution: Hermes Unity Platform

Hermes Unity Platform

*   **Unified UI:** Platform and API that enables Requestors to compliantly submit and receive requests for identified data requests.
*   **Unified Partner Integrations:** A robust backend that delivers identified back to Requestors by integrating with Partners.
    *   50 ROI Vendors
    *   500 EHR Vendors
    *   100 RWD Sources

**Diagram: Hermes Unity Platform Architecture**

This diagram illustrates the flow of requests through the Hermes Unity Platform.

*   **Requestors:** Multiple "Requester" entities are shown at the top, sending requests.
*   **Hermes - Middleware:** All requests flow into "Hermes - Middleware".
*   **Partners:** From the Middleware, requests are routed to various "Partners":
    *   ROI Vendors
    *   RWD Sources
    *   EHR Vendors
    *   Clinics

## Slide 9: More Revenue, Less Cost, and Scalable Intake

More Revenue, Less Cost, and Scalable Intake

**Value to Partners**

*   **More Demand: More Revenue**
    Hermes simplifies for Requestors the process of requesting and receiving medical records inducing demand for your data.
*   **No Tech Burden: Less Cost**
    Hermes handles integrations with Requestors so you don't have to manage one-off tech support or maintain multiple custom interfaces.
*   **Scalable Intake: Less Cost**
    Every record request arrives in a single, standardized format via Hermes—regardless of who sent it. That means lower operational cost, faster routing, and simplified scaling.

**Diagram: Value Proposition for Partners**

This diagram shows how Requestors interact with Hermes Middleware, which then distributes to various partners.

*   **Requestors:** Three generic "Requestor" icons on the left.
*   **Hermes Middleware:** Central hub connecting Requestors to Partners.
*   **Partners (on the right):**
    *   ROI Vendor
    *   RWD Source
    *   EHR Vendor
    *   Clinics

## Slide 13: Network Flywheel Effect

Network Flywheel Effect

**Two-Sided Marketplace**

Hermes Health connects Requestors with Partners creating value for both sides:

*   **Partners Benefit Via:**
    *   Increased Requests from Requestors increasing Partner revenue.
    *   Reduced fulfillment costs by switching Requestors to API submission vs Fax.
*   **Requestors Benefit Via:**
    *   Simplified record submission and delivery increasing, enabling increased demand for more requests.
    *   Improved turnaround times.

**Diagram: Hermes Health Flywheel Effect**

This diagram illustrates a positive feedback loop (flywheel effect).

*   **Starting Point (top right):** More Requestors
    *   Leads to "Faster and Easier Records" (top left)
*   **Faster and Easier Records:**
    *   Leads to "More Vendors Integrate to Capture Volume" (bottom left)
*   **More Vendors Integrate to Capture Volume:**
    *   Leads to "More Record Volume" (bottom right)
*   **More Record Volume:**
    *   Feeds back to "More Requestors"

## Slide 15: Levels of Data Partners

Levels of Data Partners

**Level 3: Full Medical Record - Retrieval**
Partners who deliver complete, longitudinal medical records, including all data from Levels 1–3 in structured or unstructured formats.

**Level 2: Basic Data - Filter**
Partners who provide basic health data such medication, lab results, diagnoses, patient demographics.

**Level 1: Provider Data - Discover**

## Slide 17: Hermes Reduces Your Legal Exposure

Hermes Reduces Your Legal Exposure

**Contracting & Liability**

Hermes signs agreements with both the Requestor and the Partner.

*   **Requestors attest that HIPAA Authorization submissions are valid and accurate.**
*   **Partners attest:**
    *   That they have the right to release identified medical data assuming a valid HIPAA Authorization.
    *   That they are releasing the correct data for the patient requested
*   **Hermes Health attests that patient data is securely handled and transmitted to the appropriate party.**

**Diagram: Liability and Attestation Flow**

This diagram illustrates the attestation and liability distribution between Requestor, Hermes Health, and Partner.

| Party           | Attestation                                                | Holds Liability For                                   |
| :-------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Requestor**   | Attest that HIPAA Authorizations are Valid and Accurate    | Inappropriate Record Submissions                      |
| **Hermes Health** | Attest that Patient Data is Secured and transmitted to the appropriate party | Inappropriate Record Disclosures (presumably if data is mishandled by Hermes) |
| **Partner**     | Attest that Records released are for the patient requested | Inappropriate Disclosure (presumably if incorrect data is released by Partner) |

## Slide 18: Solution: How it Works

Solution: How it Works

**First Neutral API for Identified Health Data**

The Hermes Health Unity Platform connects Requestors to a growing network of Partners—including ROI vendors, EHR systems, and RWD providers. How it works:

*   **Secure Intake:** Requestors securely submit patient's full name, date of birth, and a signed HIPAA Authorization form.
*   **Smart Routing:** The Unity Platform then routes these requests to our network of Partners.
*   **Partner Fulfillment:** Our Partner networks processes these Requests and securely transmits identified patient data back to the Unity Platform.
*   **Delivery:** The Unity Platform securely delivers the data back to requestors without revealing Partner-specific infrastructure or exposing individual Partner details, protecting privacy, and confidentiality
*   **Transparent Pricing:** Each Partner is paid a clear, per-record fee to keep pricing simple and aligned.

**Diagram: How it Works - Process Flow**

This diagram illustrates the end-to-end process of record retrieval through the Hermes Unity Platform.

1.  **Requestor:**
    *   Initiates with "Secure Intake" and expects "Secure Delivery."
2.  **Unity Platform:**
    *   Receives requests from Secure Intake.
    *   Manages "Partner Route Engine."
    *   Sends "API Delivery" for Partner Fulfillment.
3.  **Partner Route Engine:**
    *   Routes to "Partner" (ROI, EHR, or RWD).
4.  **Partner (ROI, EHR, or RWD):**
    *   Interacts with "Facility."
    *   Sends "Patient Data Retrived" to "Patient Data" (back to Unity Platform delivery).
5.  **Patient Data (Unity Platform):**
    *   Delivers data back to "Secure Delivery" for the Requestor.

## Slide 19: Simple, Aligned Economics

Simple, Aligned Economics

**Simple Pricing**

*   Hermes Health will integrate with your platform at no cost.
*   Hermes Health will pay the Partner on a per patient or record retrieved.

**Table: Pricing Categories**

| Category                  | Price              |
| :------------------------ | :----------------- |
| Hermes Health Integration | Free               |
| Record Transaction Fee    | $5 - $50 (Based on Partner Dataset) |
