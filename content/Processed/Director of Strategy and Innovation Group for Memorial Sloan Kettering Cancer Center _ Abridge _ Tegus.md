The purposes of today's conversation was really just to refresh some of your thoughts and get a better sense of how you guys are thinking about the space, what features and functionality are important, whether it's like we just want the most integrations, the most seamless experience, or we're really pushing the envelope on some of the coding suggestions and things of that nature. We'll guide you through a series of questions that high level. Does that all sound better to chat about?

**Expert**
Absolutely.

**Client**
Awesome. To kick it off, do you want to just give us a quick 60-second overview on your background, your role, anything that you think would be helpful context to set the stage for the conversation?

**Expert**
Absolutely. I'll just say right off the bat, I'm a clinician two days a week. I have a background in health economics and outcomes research and now have my executive MBA from Wharton. I have been working with MSK's Strategy Innovation Group and cross functional role across the organization including with our Digits and IT team on technology innovation, technology partnerships, standing up a venture studio, etc. That's my background.

I will say, although I have an awesome job, I'm starting to look for work in the private sector. I want to move at the speed of business instead of the speed of academia. I just plant a seed, you're in New York also, if ever there were a need for physician advisor or work going to the financial side, VC, etc. one of the places I'm considering, just to apply that to you.

In the context of this technology, I've been the instigator and key decision maker around use of this technology at MSK and continue to lead efforts to figure out how we are testing and evaluating these technologies and also developing the roadmap for the future products and things that we're trying.

**Client**
That's super helpful context. Appreciate you walking through all of that. Are you making decisions on behalf of all of MSKs or certain specialties? How does that work?

**Expert**
Know this is institutional so it's across MSK. Let me tell you about what we've done so far.

**Client**
A couple of more questions before you get into the evaluation. It would be helpful context to just get size of the organization, number of physicians, specialties, just a little bit more color.

**Expert**
Memorial Sloan Kettering, we're about a $7 billion enterprise, 23,000 employees. That revenue, about $5.5 billion is clinical and another $1.5 billion is clinical research from life sciences and sponsors. Despite that size and of course our brand reputation, we're a relatively small outfit. We have 1,400 physicians, an APP workforce of nearly 1,000. We only have 500 patients.

**Client**
How many physicians was that?

**Expert**
Fourteen hundred and about 1,000 APPs, nurse practitioners, and only 500 beds. We operate across New York and New Jersey now with a total of like 12 regional satellite facilities. We are beginning to grow but still relatively small.

## Client
Got it. It would be helpful to get a better sense of when you all started looking into the space and then what happened there. Did you kick off a formal RFP where you did very sophisticated deep dives into each of the companies or did you pilot some of them? It would be helpful to get that context.

## Expert
Sounds good. Almost three years ago now, we heard about these technologies before there were a lot of possible solutions. Abridge and DAX were really the two leaders at the time. We brought both of them in for informal pilots just to pressure test their technologies in a fake patient setting. We pretended to have clinical conversations and just see how it worked and we decided that it was worthwhile to stand up a formal pilot.

We didn't do a formal RFP but before we moved forward with those two companies, we did look at the market and did a couple of other pilot demos with a couple of other start-ups and they were pretty far behind at that point. We decided to stick to the two that we had gone a little deeper with.

We were on the path to going live with Epic for those years. We went live with Epic this February so just a couple of months ago. During the pilots, it was not integrated into our instance of Cerner. It was a clunky pilot where if you wanted to use any of the note output, you had to copy paste from a web browser into the note. Nonetheless, it was integrated enough that you could see the patients in clinic and select the patient to use to audio record on that particular visit.

The way we set up the pilot was 20 clinicians, used both technologies sequentially first, and then in parallel for a total of four months. We evaluated a whole bunch of criteria comparing the two companies. I can get into more details if you want but long story short, Abridge came out ahead of the two. Our clinicians preferred the note output from Abridge, thought the ontology for oncology was superior, and slightly preferred the UI/UX experience although understanding it wasn't integrated at the time.

Based on that, we've made a decision to proceed further with Abridge. We're still calling what we're doing with Abridge a pilot or expanded pilot or pilot V2 or something. We're planning now to roll it out in batches to a total of 500 clinicians if there's that much interest. We're going to stop that engagement after six months of clinicians having used it so that we can reevaluate whether we want to really take on an enterprise license.

## Client
Interesting. You guys are being very thoughtful, strategic. You're not jumping into any decision. Why is that? Why won't you just position, you're getting value out of it? Where's the complexity around purchasing it for more people and rolling it out to more people?

## Expert
Yeah. There are a couple of different things going on. First of all, we just spent 10 figures on Epic and we're just entering the stabilization phase. We also have Dragon in our Epic instance is able to do dictation directly into the note. There are these competing technologies and we have a whole bunch of old initiatives around actual in-person scribes, virtual scribes, and several other things that stakeholders around the institution have been trying to hold onto.

We think ambient clinical documentation is what's going to win out in the end. From a top-down perspective, we think that's what's going to win but we're trying to be sensitive to these other little pockets of pilots that are holding on to the work they've done. From our president to our chief digital officer and the leaders, they want to consolidate around ambient clinical documentation and Abridge or we're taking stuff. That's one piece of it.

Number two is, before we plunk down an annual spend, we have a pretty rigorous academic bent when it comes to technology evaluation and informatics with a lot of folks, clinicians and otherwise who publish on the value of technologies. We want to show that there really is value to the clinician before we commit. I should just put that on pause for one second and put a pin in it. I should definitely get back to that because that's going to be important to you.

Another third thing is, in addition to all that, we do have a co-development roadmap with Abridge for an expanded set of products and tools and we're waiting to see, "Can they follow through on that," before we get deeply in bed with them.

**Client**
Got it. Did your evaluation three years ago, times have changed so much, have you gone back and continued evaluating companies and all these other ones now? I don't know Ambience Healthcare, we hear a lot. I'm totally wondering if you've continued the evaluation.

**Expert**
Ambience and DeepScribe are the two that we have circled back to over the past couple of months because they have a reputation. I have heard from my friends and colleagues at other institutions that they are doing pretty well, especially in oncology. I very recently saw a demo of Ambience and I have spoken to my colleagues but again, I believe they have a pretty good billing and coding module. They also have a beta medical records intake module or product. That one is not widely available but they are in co-development. I know who their partner is developing that. They seem to be doing pretty well.

My friends in oncology at other institutions say that their ontology has caught up or is pretty good in oncology. The thing about oncology as opposed to other disease entities is that oncology is 400 different cancers. It is pretty complex and each one has its own nuance in terms of vocabulary, ontology. Getting that right was a challenge even a couple of years ago when we started looking at this, neither Abridge nor DAX was perfect by any means. During the course of looking at the two of them, they both were making rapid progress, Abridge faster than DAX.

**Client**
You mentioned some of the products that Ambience has started to move into, are those important to you? I think what we're trying to understand is from what we've heard from folks in your seat, it's like Ambience does have some element of a broader product or platform here. It sounds like Abridge is working on a lot of that functionality. From our seat, if you put our hat on, we're just trying to get under like is it really important that Ambience has that today and Abridge might not be able to build that or is it like, "Hey, Abridge is going to come out with this tomorrow or next week or next month, whatever it might be. We already have Abridge so we're just going to stick with that." I'm trying to give you some of the context behind the questions, if that's helpful.

**Expert**
It's the latter of those. We think that we now have a trusted relationship with Abridge and we believe in them. They've been following through on what they have said that they will do now in our relationship over the past year. It is important to us to have those modules and Abridge has it on their roadmap in 2025.

**Client**
Okay. If you think about the functionality of both platforms, it's like core ambient listening the most important piece of functionality or is it also just as important that by the end of 2025 they both have some billing suggested or some of the other pieces of functionality?

**Expert**
Clinical documentation is still the most important priority. I would like double click on that. There's so many other areas in which we want to do clinical documentation. We have started in the outpatient setting but inpatient, a nursing module in our emergency room setting, in our virtual telehealth business, that has its own tentacles. That's still the most important piece of the engagement.

I'd say it's a pretty close second. Now that we're on Epic, as we think about how we work more efficiently, the idea of having one partner rather than a whole bunch of vendor relationships, one partner that's like a co-development rather than a vendor relationship is really attractive and important to us to build out other use cases.

# Document Content

## Client
Got it. It sounds like both expanding the existing product and turning it into a more encompassing platform with the suggestive coding piece and others is where you want the product to go and it's not one or the other. You want them to do all of these things, ideally. Does Abridge only have an outpatient product?

## Expert
No. They have worked with other providers on inpatient as well as nursing according to them. I haven't taken a deep dive on it but it's not that different or challenging to figure that out. For example, our inpatient nursing module, there's just this different way that we want the documentation to be outputted. That's been somewhat bespoke to our organization or to oncology in particular, but it's not that challenging to take a computation and have our set of note outputs that we want them to map to. That should be easy for them to as compared to billing or coding or intake of medical records or some of the other co-development products that haven't mentioned yet.

## Client
What if Ambience came to you and it's like today they have this broader coding and billing piece that you've heard good things about, your team just took a demo. It sounds like the products are neck and neck. What if they came to you and said, "We'll offer you the whole product suite at 50% the cost," or something like that, how would you think about that?

## Expert
We would consider it. We're not so deeply in bed yet. That's why we're calling this a pilot, again, with Abridge because we realize we would like to select a long-term partner but we are being cautious about doing that yet.

## Client
Say you roll out to these next 500 clinicians and it goes well and you want to select this enterprise-wide solution, what's going to go into that evaluation? Does Abridge have the far-and-away lead where it's in all likelihood unless something really bad happens you'll go with Abridge or is it going to be a true RFP where you're going to evaluate the different solutions and you might have to do some changeover and implementation integrations? How do you think about that?

## Expert
I think honestly we're most likely to stick with Abridge unless they mess it up, unless they don't follow through on giving us a billing module by Q3 when they said they will. It doesn't have to be perfect but at least that they've followed through on their timeline.

## Client
Ambience is a much smaller team? Has Abridge given you any indications or reasons how Ambience came out and went GA with this product, the billing and coding product, much before Abridge was able to?

## Expert
Abridge's thesis has been that if they can win the clinician then they're going to win the market. Meaning, they've been trying to have the note output just be so superior that it's preferred by clinicians, their primary product is being superior. Again, I've seen the demo of Ambience but I haven't tried it. I haven't used it in my own patients. I am not only clinician, but I'm also one of the clinician champions. Neither I nor my colleagues have tried it.

From speaking to my friends at other institutions, they're happy with Ambience. These technologies are just frankly amazing. Even when we were using DAX, it's pretty incredible. The enthusiasm from our clinicians around the way the note looks from Abridge seems to be higher than even talk to my friends about Ambience.

## Transcript

**Client:** The way that you guys talk about Abridge seems like higher than how your colleagues or your friends talk about Ambience? Is that what you just said?

**Expert:** Yeah. The clinicians at MSK are like, "This is the most amazing thing I've ever seen," whereas when they were talking about DAX they were like, "This is extremely cool." With Abridge, they're like, "This is incredible."

**Client:** Do you think if you gave a clinician Ambience and Abridge, just head to head, do you think 10/10 times they would pick Abridge because it's just a better experience or do you not have enough information right now to comment on that?

**Expert:** I would guess that it's probably a little bit condition-specific. I would guess that Abridge would come out ahead 6/10 times, 7/10 times.

**Client:** Okay. It's not like far and away like it's 10X better or anything like that. It's just slightly better.

**Expert:** Yeah. I think that's right. The thing about MSK, and I think part of why they've been able to catch up so fast, is that they're relying on OpenAI, which just has so much funding and their models continue to evolve so rapidly. Yes, Abridge has a head start. Yes, Abridge is built solely for healthcare.

**Client:** Is Abridge not using OpenAI?

**Expert:** No. I think they have their own LLM.

**Client:** Really? Interesting.

**Expert:** Which is cool. It's custom built.

**Client:** Seems like you're losing battle.

**Expert:** Maybe. Although Abridge claims that they're the fastest growing AI company in the world right now, but that's just in terms of funding and people. Maybe they really are, maybe they really will be long-term competitors and just like specific healthcare niche.

**Client:** Your thesis is that Ambience has maybe been able to catch up and there's limited differentiation in the quality and accuracy of the output given Ambience is just relying on OpenAI, who's a whale, and Abridge is trying to do all of this themselves? Is that fair?

**Expert:** I think that's pretty fair. Catching up, I don't know if they've caught up or they're at least able to stay pretty.

**Client**
Got it. Few rapid fire questions just as we're coming up on time. How do you think about a large health system spending in the seven figures for clinical documentation? Do you think it could get up to the eight figures as they expand product? Where do you think this taps out for a large health system?

**Expert**
I think we could get to eight figures if we really build out the suite of different products that we're talking about. I think we could get up to eight figures. Our hope is that we're going to co-develop and share in some of the benefits.

**Client**
Are you guys focused at all on ROI? I think the initial documentation product is really levered towards patient experience, and provider experience, that sort of thing. I feel like you could draw a more hard dollar ROI. How do you think about that dynamic?

**Expert**
In the second pilot, we are obviously evaluating clinician experience and all that pajama time, etc. Regarding ROI, we're specifically looking at some studies have said doctors would be willing to see more patients. I think that's bullshit. Instead, what I do think is realistic is the technology will surface additional ICD diagnosis codes for a given conversation that a clinician may not even realize they were managing.

I do head and neck cancer. I talk about dysphagia and I say, "I'm going to send my patient to a speech and language pathologist." That's a 30-second conversation. Sometimes I wouldn't even document or think that had anything to do with billing but that's a second chronic condition so potentially a level four rather than level three. We're doing a pre-post, same clinician use of the technology.

**Client**

That technology is not live yet, suggested coding sd@virtuevc.com for Abridge?

**Expert**
Correct. We haven't started the new pilot.

**Client**
In Q3, they probably could be out.

**Expert**
Exactly.

**Client**
Okay. Last two questions. I know we up on time. If you had to rank the stickiness of Abridge in terms of how difficult it would be to rip this out where you'd have to do a new implementation, you have to train up new employees, all the models would have to be retrained on clinician preference and their voice, all of those things, 0-10 with 10 being the highest, where would you put Abridge on that?

**Expert**
Probably an eight. I think it's probably true for Ambience at Cleveland Clinic too.

**Client**
Last question is if you had to recommend Abridge to a colleague in a similar role as yours and you put it on a scale of 0-10, 10 being the highest?

# Expert-Client Conversation Transcript

## Expert
Eight or nine.

## Client
What could they do better?

## Expert
The one thing about this technology for it really to be high value to a clinician, the ultimate goal needs to be that each clinician can create a bespoke note output. Abridge is amazing at nailing the note but clinicians like their notes to look the way that they're used to it looking. The ideal is that it learns from your old notes and figures out that style and uses that same style for your new note. I've talked to the CEO about this and they said, "Yeah, that's cool but it's too far away." If it committed to that, then I would give it a 10.

## Client
Awesome. Thank you for taking the time to speak with me. Have a nice day.
