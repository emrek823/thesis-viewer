On May 22, the House of Representatives passed the One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB). The bill contains many health policy provisions aimed at addressing excesses and abuses during the Biden administration. The policies would reform Medicaid by reducing state Medicaid money laundering schemes, introducing work and community engagement requirements, and removing ineligible enrollees. The policies would also significantly increase program integrity in the [Affordable Care Act](https://paragoninstitute.org/glossary/affordable-care-act/) ([ACA](https://paragoninstitute.org/glossary/aca/)) exchanges by reversing many Biden administration policies that pursued enrollment at any cost and led to tens of billions of fraudulent spending. The bill also includes a significant expansion of [health savings accounts](https://paragoninstitute.org/glossary/health-savings-accounts/) (HSAs).

Based upon estimates from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the health provisions would reduce federal outlays on Medicaid and [ACA](https://paragoninstitute.org/glossary/aca/) subsidies by about $1.15 trillion over the next decade—a significant down payment to put federal health programs on a more sustainable financial trajectory.[1](#cmfSimpleFootnoteLink1 "The estimates presented in this paper draw from CBO estimates. In addition, we make some adjustments to account for the earlier implementation of the community-engagement requirements and the appropriation of CSRs. These will likely be fairly small modifications, particularly as CBO evaluates the interaction between the Ways and Means provisions and those from the Energy and Commerce Committee. We also discuss the implications of the codification of two Trump administration proposed rules: \"2025 Marketplace Integrity and Affordability Proposed Rule\" and \"Preserving Medicaid Funding for Vulnerable Populations?Closing a Health Care-Related Tax Loophole Proposed Rule.\"") Some of the health care provisions, principally the ones that expand HSAs, reduce government revenue. When these provisions are combined with the complete savings from rules proposed by the Trump administration and codified by the OBBB, the overall health care savings would be about $1.25 trillion.[2](#cmfSimpleFootnoteLink2 "The OBBB essentially codifies two HHS proposed rules, the \"2025 Marketplace Integrity and Affordability Proposed Rule\" and \"Preserving Medicaid Funding for Vulnerable Populations?Closing a Health Care-Related Tax Loophole Proposed Rule.\" In CBO scoring convention, it counts half the savings or costs when Congress codifies rules proposed by administrations. We account for the full savings of these provisions in this analysis.") This is a sizeable amount but still less than the $1.8 trillion increase in the federal Medicaid and [ACA](https://paragoninstitute.org/glossary/aca/) subsidy baselines during the Biden administration.

This document contains a summary and brief analysis of all the health care elements of OBBB. As the legislation moves to the Senate, it is important to maintain the health policy wins within the OBBB while pursuing additional reforms to reduce waste, fraud, and abuse within federal health care programs and preserve Medicaid for the most vulnerable.

# Provisions in the Ways and Means Committee Version[3](#cmfSimpleFootnoteLink3 "Available at ")

### Subtitle A—Make American Families and Workers Thrive Again

[*Beyond the budgetary effects described for individual sections in [Part A](https://paragoninstitute.org/glossary/part-a/), interaction of provisions leads to a further $1.7 billion savings over 10 years, 2025-2034. However, much of Subtitle A is not related to health spending.]*

#### Part 3—Investing in the Health of American Families and Workers

This part of the OBBB includes some of the most pro-consumer, pro-competition reforms in recent history. These provisions would empower millions of Americans with greater control over their health care spending, helping to put downward pressure on prices. Markets work best when people control their own spending and are sensitive to price changes. Unfortunately, the current health system puts more control of personal health care decisions in the hands of employers rather than employees or patients.[4](#cmfSimpleFootnoteLink4 "Theo Merkel and Brian Blase, \"Follow the Money: How Tax Policy Shapes Health Care,\" Paragon Health Institute, May 2024, ")

This part of the reconciliation package seeks to address this issue by putting more money under the control of workers through expansions of individual coverage health reimbursement arrangements (ICHRAs) and HSAs, which allow consumers to access the care they need. These reforms to ICHRAs and HSAs ultimately fund patients, not the system, and increase American health care freedom.

#### Enhancing ICHRAs, Renamed CHOICE Arrangements

This bill contains three sections that codify and expand ICHRAs, which allow employers to give workers more control over their health care spending.  
*[On-budget cost $514 million in reduced tax revenue over 10 years, 2025-2034, for the three following sections.]*

##### Sec. 110201. Treatment of Health Reimbursement Arrangements Integrated with Individual Market Coverage.

This section codifies President Trump’s 2019 [ICHRA](https://paragoninstitute.org/glossary/ichra/) rule and renames ICHRAs as Custom Health Option and Individual Care Expense (CHOICE) Arrangements.[5](#cmfSimpleFootnoteLink5 "Brian Blase, \"Trump's New Rule Will Give Businesses and Workers Better Health Care Options,\" CNN, June 14, 2019, ") In 2019, the Trump administration finalized a rule to permit employers to provide employees with ICHRAs—a tax-free contribution for workers to purchase health insurance in the individual market. ICHRAs provide workers with greater health insurance options while simplifying the coverage process for employers and potentially reducing their costs.

##### Sec. 110202. Participants in CHOICE Arrangement Eligible for Purchase of [Exchange](https://paragoninstitute.org/glossary/exchange/) Insurance Under Cafeteria Plan.

This section allows employees to use pre-tax income to pay their share of premiums when selecting [exchange](https://paragoninstitute.org/glossary/exchange/) plans.

##### Sec. 110203. Employer Credit for CHOICE Arrangement.

This section creates a temporary two-year credit for businesses with fewer than 50 employees that offer CHOICE arrangements for the first time—$100 per employee per month in year one and $50 per employee per month in year two. Although these credits are more generous, the policy is similar to a two-year credit enacted by Indiana in 2024.[6](#cmfSimpleFootnoteLink6 "Brian Blase and Al Hubbard, \"To Improve Health Care, Let Consumers Choose,\" Newsweek, May 15, 2023, ") This section also permits employers to provide small businesses with the option to provide employees with a choice between a traditional group plan and a CHOICE arrangement.

#### Enhancing HSAs

These 10 provisions expand access to HSAs and broaden how individuals can use them for their health care. People can contribute to HSAs only if they have a specific type of health plan—dubbed a high-[deductible](https://paragoninstitute.org/glossary/deductible/) health plan (HDHP)—and no other disqualifying health coverage. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has issued strict guidelines that preclude many people from contributing to HSAs. The OBBB [HSA](https://paragoninstitute.org/glossary/hsa/) provisions address many of these preclusions and would thus permit more people to contribute to HSAs.

##### Sec. 110204. Individuals Entitled to [Part A](https://paragoninstitute.org/glossary/part-a/) of Medicare by Reason of Age Allowed to Contribute to [Health Savings Accounts](https://paragoninstitute.org/glossary/health-savings-accounts/).

*[Net on-budget cost: $1.9 billion, including $4.9 billion on-budget cost for [Health Savings Accounts](https://paragoninstitute.org/glossary/health-savings-accounts/) tax deduction less $3 billion in Medicare savings]*

Currently, individuals who are enrolled in any part of Medicare (including Medicare [Part A](https://paragoninstitute.org/glossary/part-a/)) are not able to contribute to HSAs, even if they have an HDHP. Seniors are automatically enrolled in Medicare Part A if they take Social Security, even if they do not want Part A because they are still working and covered by their employer’s HDHP. This section of the bill would remove that limitation and allow working seniors who have HDHPs to continue contributing to their HSAs. This would permit more seniors to continue to save money for their health care while not discouraging continued work.

##### Sec. 110205. Treatment of Direct Primary Care Service Arrangements*.*

*[On-budget cost: $2.1 billion]*

Direct primary care (DPC) is an arrangement where people pay a primary care practice a flat monthly fee for access to its services, avoiding the hassle of insurance for providers and patients. Current rules prevent people from contributing to HSAs if they have DPC arrangements or using their HSAs to pay the monthly fees for DPC arrangements. This provision removes these limitations and permits people with DPC arrangements to contribute to HSAs and to use HSAs to [pay for](https://paragoninstitute.org/glossary/pay-for/) DPC arrangements up to a $150 monthly limit for individuals and a $300 monthly limit for families.

##### Sec. 110206. Allowance of Bronze and Catastrophic Plans in Connection with Health Savings Accounts.

*[On-budget cost: $3.6 billion]*

This provision would make it easier for individuals on the ACA to have HSAs. Currently, many bronze and catastrophic plans are not compatible with HSAs. For example, many bronze and catastrophic plans have out-of-pocket limits that exceed IRS limits for HDHPs. This provision expands the definition of HDHPs to include bronze and catastrophic plans, thereby increasing access to HSAs.

##### Sec. 110207. On-Site Employee Clinics.

*[On-budget cost: $1.8 billion]*

Many employers have historically had doctors on site at the workplace to help with employees’ medical needs.[7](#cmfSimpleFootnoteLink7 "Christy Ford Chapin, \"How Doctors Broke Health Care,\" Reason, May 2020, ") Individuals are not legally permitted to contribute to HSAs if they receive free or discounted services (other than a limited set) at on-site health clinics. This provision allows individuals covered by HDHPs to contribute to HSAs if they have access to specific free or discounted services at on-site health clinics.

##### Sec. 110208. Certain Amounts Paid for Physical Activity, Fitness, and Exercise Treated as Amounts Paid for Medical Care.

*[On-budget cost: $7.8 billion]*

This provision permits individuals to use their HSAs for physical fitness memberships and instructional physical activity programs up to $500 per year for an individual and $1,000 per year for a family. These limits apply monthly, which equates to about $42 a month for a single and $83 a month for a family.

##### Sec. 110209. Allow Both Spouses to Make Catch-Up Contributions to the Same Health Savings Account*.*

*[On-budget cost: $1.4 billion]*

Under current law, individuals age 55 and older can make “catch-up” [HSA](https://paragoninstitute.org/glossary/hsa/) contributions
