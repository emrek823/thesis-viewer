### Q3 Performance & KPIs

- Strong momentum in core metrics
	- Referral volume continues extremely strong trajectory
	- BT recruiting robust, BCBA recruiting slower (under market comp structure)
	- New clinics at expected year-end targets
- Assessment vs intervention pipeline
	- Assessment clients: strong leading indicator
	- Intervention flat due to staffing constraints, two new locations not yet operational
	- Assessment to intervention lag: 8-12 weeks, close to zero drop-off rate
	- Q4/Q1 expected catch-up as Western and Wilburn locations ramp
- Financial position
	- Burning ~$175K/month (4+ years runway)
	- Contribution profit trending positively
	- Both centers profitable with strong four-wall economics

### Market Expansion Strategy

- Massachusetts: 8 clinics by end of 2026, all in-state
	- 40M top-line potential across locations
	- Andover and Foxborough signed LOIs
- Next four target markets assessment
	- Arizona & Indiana: actively contracting, large markets
	- Minnesota: acquisition opportunity - Western Autism Services ($350K, $250K down)
	- Missouri: smaller practice acquisition (~$250K total)
	- Washington State: open but limited commercial viability
- Recommended approach: two markets + one acquisition
	- Minnesota acquisition for closed market entry
	- One organic market (Arizona or Indiana, whichever contracts first)
	- Estimated $5M investment over 36 months to break even per new market

### Blueprint/Holdco Strategy Discussion

- Market dynamics forcing strategic pivot
	- AI focus increasingly mandatory for investors
	- Exit outcome requirements significantly higher
	- Traditional care delivery models losing investor appeal
- Blueprint concept: centralized AI infrastructure extensible across specialties
	- Leverage Anna learnings for multiple operating companies
	- Transform from single specialty to healthcare services platform
- Early investor feedback positive
	- Andreessen Horowitz and Transformation Capital engaged
	- $30-40M raise target for combined Anna + Blueprint vision
	- Timeline: prove Anna first, Blueprint development 2027-2028
- Implementation considerations
	- Anna stabilization priority through 2026
	- Parallel processing acceptable with proper expectation management
	- Product insights 100% transferable, actual product 0% functional across specialties

### Organizational Structure & Hiring

- Field operations structure
	- State GM owns market, regions of ~6 clinics underneath
	- Community outreach director at state level
	- Regional clinical directors reporting to senior clinical leadership
- 2026 hiring priorities
	- Implementation Director for new market standup
	- State GM for second market
	- Chief People Officer (HR becoming business-critical)
	- Director of Operations under Becky
	- CTO consideration ($250-300K salary range recommended)
- Compensation structure refinements needed
	- BCBA comp restructure from bonus-heavy to base salary
	- Bonus percentages should increase with seniority levels

### Executive Compensation Review

- OKR achievement assessment for bonus calculations
	- Full day equivalent intervention clients: 21.5 vs 40 target (major miss)
	- Locations opened: hit target
	- Available hours: slight miss due to BCBA ramping
	- Unit contribution margin: close to target
- Recommended approach: 73.5% baseline achievement
	- Individual multipliers based on performance (70-115% range)
	- Different treatment for underperforming vs high-performing executives
	- Legal considerations for terminated team members

### AI & Technology Roadmap

- Current progress on track
	- Clinical decision support tool development accelerated
	- Vector database and reinforcement learning in progress
	- RCM infrastructure already AI-enabled
- Bottlenecks identified
	- LMS development stalled due to clinical leadership gaps
	- Need stronger clinical input for decision support tools

### Next Steps

- Market expansion decisions by Q4
- Minnesota acquisition due diligence continuation
- Blueprint investor conversations (Andreessen Horowitz meeting this week)
- Executive compensation finalization and communication
- Q4 board meeting scheduling for early Q1 2026
