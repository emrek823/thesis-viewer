### Background

- Previously worked at Quid doing healthcare NLP with biopharma companies
- Worked at Rigetti Computing on product strategy team and Series C ($79M)
- Led BD/IR at Excision Bio, helped raise $60M Series A and grew team to 34
- Spent time at Ginkgo Bioworks before starting Palm Health

### Product Vision & Strategy

- Plans to own the customer layer as distribution platform for testing innovations
- Building long-term testing cadence outside traditional insurance constraints
- Initial D2C focus targeting high net worth individuals
- Future B2B opportunity - employers could offer as parallel cancer insurance
- Aims to integrate blood-based testing and imaging into comprehensive program

### Market Analysis & Differentiation

- Current landscape dominated by point solutions without cohesive offering
- Moving beyond one-off tests (like Grail) or PCP-recommended screening
- Positioning between fully democratized consumer model and traditional medical system
- Function Health’s success validates market demand for packaged testing solutions
- Insurance stranglehold on screening paradigm is eroding

### Core Thesis

- Primary goal: Catch 80-90% of cancers at stage I
- Current system only catches 15-20% of cancers at early stages
- Aiming to prove consumer/employer demand exists beyond standard insurance offerings
- Focus on improving treatment effectiveness through early detection
- Reducing downstream economic costs of late-stage cancer treatment

### Implementation Approach

- Leveraging telehealth for patient intake and assessment
- Using Doctor Corona for backend infrastructure
- Physicians will conduct telehealth consultations to:
	- Assess background risk
	- Prescribe testing plan from ~40 available tests
	- Design one-year screening program
- Building connections for mobile phlebotomy and imaging center scheduling
- Actively seeking physician co-founder/partner for initial patient experience

### Next Steps

- Completing MVP development over next month
- Testing platform internally
- Planning to launch with initial patients within 6 weeks
- Contemplating fundraise in ~2 months after first patient cycle
- Focused on launching and iterating with small patient cohort

### Additional Context

- Function Health’s success validated market timing
- Insurance constraints historically limited innovation
- Moving beyond population health guidelines (e.g., screening at 60)
- Building automated, comprehensive screening approach
