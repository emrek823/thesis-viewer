KEY POINTS

The use of AI in the mental health space has outpaced both scientific validation and regulation oversight.

Chatbots struggle to meet even basic therapeutic standards expected of human clinicians.

AI can cause incorrect, or misleading advice in situations ranging from crisis responses to coping strategies.

Viktoria, a young woman of Ukrainian descent, was living in Poland when she consulted ChatGPT for mental health support. Instead of receiving support or encouragement, the AI-generated “therapist” validated her thoughts of self-harm and suggested ways that she could kill herself. The bot allegedly dismissed the value of her human relationships and even drafted a suicide note. Fortunately, Viktoria showed the messages to her mother, who reported them to OpenAI in the summer of 2025. The company responded that this was a “violation of their safety standards.”

Other young people weren’t so lucky. There are currently multiple lawsuits filed against AI companies for what are alleged to be contributing factors to the suicides of Adam Raine and Sewell Setzer, among others. Last year, I wrote a post about the dangers of AI-generated romance. This article outlines the risks of what is becoming all too common—AI-generated mental health therapy. A letter published in JAMA Open Network reported that 13 percent of American youths use AI for mental health advice. That represents over 5 million individuals.

Inadequate Understanding of Complex Human Psychology

Risk of Harmful or Misleading Guidance

JD Vanderkooy, medical director of Homewood Health Centre’s Eating Disorders Program, urges caution when using digital tools to treat complex eating disorders. He stated, “Eating disorders require nuanced, individualized care. Unlike trained clinicians, tools such as AI chatbots and telehealth platforms can’t adapt to emotional cues or complex interpersonal dynamics.”

A striking example occurred in 2023 when the National Eating Disorders Association in the U.S. piloted an AI chatbot intended to support individuals with eating disorders. The pilot quickly ended due to failure—instead of offering coping strategies, the bot promoted weight loss advice, reinforcing harmful diet culture and triggering vulnerable users.

Privacy, Data Security, and Ethical Transparency

Without rigorous privacy safeguards and clear ethical standards for data usage, users may be exposed to exploitation, breaches, or future harms tied to the very personal information they disclose in moments of vulnerability.

Over-Reliance and Emotional Dependency

While the constant availability of AI therapy bots offers a non-judgmental space for individuals with conditions such as depression and provides immediate coping strategies for those with anxiety disorders, this accessibility could foster an over-reliance on AI, potentially sidelining crucial human interactions and professional therapy vital for comprehensive treatment.

Emerging Policy and Regulatory Concern

AI as Support, Not Replacement

AI has the potential to augment mental health care by offering psychoeducation, symptom tracking, or supporting clinicians with data analytics. However, current evidence clearly shows that AI systems should not replace human therapists. The dangers of misinterpretation, harmful responses, privacy risks, emotional dependence, and bias far outweigh any benefits these platforms can offer.
