Priyanka reaction

No rush

Get update from Priyanka on individual / firm interest in this Seed-II.

Yesterday, emailed LabCorp (can make a decision within 2 weeks), Rock Health (1 of funds she likes), Overwater (Kristina Simmons – was very helpful to Evvy in early days; interim CEO of Day, likely potentially Evvy’s biggest competitor), Margot personally (not less than $100K), Julia Cheek (cannot angel invest in other testing businesses), Amy/G9 celebrity strategics (e.g. Amy Schumer, Larue Dern, Naomi Watts, Whitney Heard, Oprah, etc.) etc.

High-level data request / updates (e.g. run rate, monthly rev, # of users, update on care delivery timing, etc.)

Signing Wheel contract by EOW

Hit $1M run rate ~2 weeks ago

Ask about Series A milestones and timing to influence discussions below

Milestones:

Timing: has data from care platform;

In bad case scenario – more time to prove out performance + metrics

Q1-23 (good case) or 	Q2/Q3 (bad case)

Commentary on metrics

Monthly revenue ($80-$100K):

Growth rate (with vs without care delivery driving additional margin):

Burn ($150K today to $200-$300K in high-burn scenario): 4+1.5

Series A Timing / Milestones

Data request

Consumer-facing (D2C metrics): Run-rate, kits sold, growth rate, AOV, blended CAC, ROAS, organic sales  %, subscribers, retention

Scientific & clinical progress: Clinical study progress for 75 women to validate care pathways, additional studies planned (if any), proprietary MAGs, LDT development, conversations with LabCopr

Care delivery function update: Logistics (Wheel, legal infrastructure, etc) and timing/scope of launch

Financials (burn/runway): Conservative, base, aggressive burn scenarios

Team/hiring: Hiring plan over next 12-18 months

Milestones for the next 12 month

Overview: We continued to communicate our interest in getting more dollars into the business and supporting you, but it will be more challenging for us to participate in an uncapped note.

LPAC commentary & OUR discomfort with issuing an uncapped note (given fund 1, less than 12 months in, market uncertainty, Series A data points, etc.)

Not capturing upside (we really need to be at >3%):

30% discount

$60M pre: 3.03%

$75M pre: 2.64%

$100M pre: 2.24%

$125M pre: 1.99%

40% discount:

$75M pre: 2.90%

$100M pre: 2.44%

$125M pre: 2.16%

LPAC

TL;DR: we cannot afford to put our firm in jeopardy; lots of conversations with our LPAC in the last few months, and in the last 48 hours specific to this re-investment into Evvy.

** Be ready to give perspective on our business, incentives and what is top of mind for us/Virtue.

Uncapped puts Virtue/Evvy at odds: We want to always be in support of what’s best for the business and timing for growth, not optimizing for a lower valuation that is more advantageous with our structure

Series A market is unclear: How long will this last? What will people value coming off the back of this? How active will investors be? What type of investor (consumer, healthcare, life sciences, etc) will value

Seed Flat / Down Rounds: Tier 1s (e.g. GC, Founders Fund, etc.) are pre-emptively leading down round seed extensions.

Structure Scenarios

Capped (no higher than $45M post)

Uncapped (Virtue at 30-40% in side letter; rest at 10-20%)

Uncapped w/ cap in Virtue side letter (no higher than $45M post; the rest at 10-20% discount)

Valuation cap does not influence subsequent financing to extent many believe

Recora and Atlas as examples:

Data Request

Series A comps for care delivery companies to make comparison to low-margin, D2C testing business that Evvy is today

You are not yet providing care (although we have confidence you will succeed) but as a comp the best care delivery companies are raising at $30-$60M pre-money. Essentially a 25% discount to what we saw over the previous 2 years

Allara - struggling to raise

Neura - struggling to raise $8M since their on track to hit $2.5M ARR (previous $22M valuation)

Wheel SMB – 80% churn (SMBs can’t meet minimums)

Comps for low-margin testing businesses today, which are more in line with how Series A investors who have not had the

Ash Wellness (10-20% gross margins on their testing business, $15M in revenue for 2022) was only able to raise $10-20M at 30%+ dilution

A number of investors in the market are entirely staying away from D2C unless they can show payer contracts.

Trajectory of RWD companies: Valuation inflection point comes later in the business (Series B) given time necessary to produce valuable insights.

Flatiron: $40M post @ Series A (20% dilution); $195M pre at Series B (40% dilution)

At Series A fundraise: Demonstrated they can collect EMR data at scale, and get paid through RCM services ($80-$100K) to subsidize data collection

At Series B fundraise: Able to generate insights with pharma (label expansion, clinical trial recruitment) to demonstrate dataset drives

Foundation: $66M post @ Series A (65% dilution); $200M Series B (25% dilution)

At Series A fundraise: Companion diagnostic to help oncologists choose the right cancer drug based on known, actionable mutations. Comprehensive profiling was still in research phase

At Series B fundraise: Increase in the number of actionable mutations to drive treatment decisions, growing dataset and access to patients, applications with biopharma beyond companion diagnostic (translational research, RWD studies)
