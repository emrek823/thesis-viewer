Clinical trials account for 70% of pharma R&D costs, yet 90% of them fail. They are the single biggest bottleneck to drug development.

Valinor is reversing that success rate.

## We don't model cells.

## We model patients.

We collect more than single-cell readouts from isolated experiments — we generate virtual patient profiles grounded in rich, longitudinal data across a broad spectrum of multi-omics and clinical assay samples.  
  
Where others look at cell behavior in silos, we simulate therapeutic efficacy at the level that matters most: the whole patient.

## From scattered to streamlined

Our models will effectively simulate how therapies will perform before a single human trial even begins.

Through automated patient simulations trained on the largest clinical longitudinal datasets ever assembled,

Valinor is turning complexity into clarity. And failure into success.
