## Slide 12: Budget Notes

*   We are projecting on a FY cash basis to grow our revenue by ~3x from $756k to $2.2M, with a **December '24 run rate of $5.2M**
*   Our revenue is recognized on a cash basis, with a one-month delay for accounts receivable, aligning our financial reporting with actual cash flow
*   **Expansion Plans:**
    *   Raleigh clinic launch scheduled for July (projecting ~40 patients by year end)
    *   Houston clinic launch scheduled for September (projecting ~15 patients by year end)
    *   Los Angeles clinic growth: We anticipate our LA clinic will grow to ~60 patients by year-end. This represents a 2x increase from where we ended 2023, with growth being led primarily due to stronger insurance network coverage and strengthened relationships with referral partners (UCLA, Cedars Sinai and CommonSpirit)
*   **Cash Burn Considerations:**
    *   Corporate Hiring: To support the launch and growth of new clinics, we're expanding our full-time corporate team from 4 FTEs and 5 Part-time/Consultants at the start of 2024, to 18 FTEs & 6 Part-time/Consultants by year-end
*   Upside to this budget would stem from launching clinics in NYC and Ohio in 2024 (currently we are projecting to launch both in Q1 2025), as well as additional patient growth.
*   In 2025, we will build significantly on the 2 clinics launched in 2024 as well as open additional locations (NYC, Ohio, Arizona, Florida).

## Slide 16: Amae Recovery Tool and codified Level of Care transition criteria created with Amae psychiatrists to standardize care

### Amae supports members for life across the care continuum

*(Diagram: Care Continuum Phases)*
**ENGAGE** (Post-Acute Engagement) -> **STABILIZE -> RECOVER** (Intensive Phase -> Step-down Phase -> Maintenance Phase) -> **PROSPER** (Life-long Support + Health Equity Solution)

**To ensure consistent, standardized care as we scale, we are codifying criteria to inform LoC transitions in a data-driven manner**

**Design principles informing metrics:**
*   Impact (link to outcomes)
*   Clarity / simplicity
*   Objectivity
*   Consistency
*   Actionability

**Metrics and processes to be built in collaboration with expert psychiatrists**

*   *(Image: Headshot of Dr. Scott Fears)*

*   *(Image: Headshot of Dr. Gary Tsai)*
    **Dr. Gary Tsai**
    MEDICAL DIRECTOR, BEHAVIORAL HEALTH & SUD
    Director of Substance Abuse and Prevention Control @ LA DPH || MD @ UC Davis

**The metrics we define will be tracked and analyzed via Amae's developing tech stack**

**Tech stack to be built on Palantir Foundry**

**LoC transition metrics to be tracked consistently, surfaced clearly for clinicians and leveraged to improve and standardize quality care**

## Slide 22: Houston, Texas

        *   Up from expected 1k; will require a larger up-front investment, but translates to a larger opportunity for Amae
        *   Contract structure was approved: $300 PEMPM + FFS + 50% shared savings on TCOC

*   **Risks:**
    *   Patient referral volume (can likely de-risk via PSA with St. Luke's or Memorial Hermann; less success contracting with BS of TX)
    *   Transportation logistics given wider net of attributed population from Optum
