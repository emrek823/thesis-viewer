## Slide 10: Feedback?

# Feedback?
* What goals would you want us to hit by the time we reach our Series A?
* What are the key north-star metrics and KPIs we should measure ourselves against?

What do we need to build from product & experience perspective?
Data infrastructure
We know our target customer segment, we know how to get to them
Scaling a proven product experience
Investing in the core (data not probiotic) — defending lower price point for adoption
Customer = consumer + provider see this as better than the status quo (better than ordering 5 tests, cheaper, efficient for workflow, serve differently)
Multiple channels, validating that they can be productive, referenceable, scaleable
Get costs down + secondary relationships for other kinds of R&D
What's proving the longer term strategy of the value of the data
Super engaged people with closed loop – machine where we can launch other tests
Multiple believable pathways (engaged customers who are interested in other tests, services, products)
Optum*

Women willing to come to us, stay engaged AND working with provider to do research to show this is a better pathway (reducing visits reduce cost e.g. livongo) — reimbursable new standard of care

Does probiotic put us at risk

## Slide 11: Strategic Questions

# Strategic Questions
Privileged & Confidential

## Slide 12: Strategic Decisions for Discussion

# Strategic Decisions for Discussion
* Becoming a diagnostic
* Growing B2B channel
* Unit economics
Privileged & Confidential

## Slide 13: Becoming a diagnostic

# Becoming a diagnostic
Do we want to be an FDA approved 24 hr BV / yeast / STD / HPV diagnostic? If we don't, someone else will (Ro, Everlywell, etc.)

Pros
* PCR = better unit economics
* Clear demand from patients given current limitations in diagnostic process
* Easily understandable value prop that can lead in to more complex vaginal microbiome sell
* Can biobank the samples for future analysis

Cons
* No contribution / improvement other than at home (no new info, better definition, etc.)
* Very different logistical setup from our current business
* Not funding the high fidelity sequencing / data collection
Privileged & Confidential

## Slide 14: Growing B2B channels

# Growing B2B channels
How much do prioritize this as a channel alongside D2C?
What conversations should be starting to have with pharma?

Pros
* Insurance reimbursement, distribution through clinics = access to much bigger pool of customers, potentially a bigger database of Evvy customers sooner
* Lower distribution costs + low CAC = improved unit economics

Cons
* Less subscription customers
* Harder to collect metadata
* Highly fragmented market
* Allocating resources to this over growing D2C channel
Privileged & Confidential

## Slide 15: Unit Economics

# Unit Economics
What is the right investment in customer experience and the trade-off vs burning cash?

Pros
* Focus on high NPS = happier customers (higher LTV, more referrals etc)

Cons
* Time and $ constraints (e.g., sending additional samples to lab, sending free kits etc) vs investments elsewhere
