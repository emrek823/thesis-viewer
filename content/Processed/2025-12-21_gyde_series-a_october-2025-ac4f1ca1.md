# Problem

Operational burdens put service and scale at odds, hindering growth and suppressing the value they could provide.

| Rising Administrative Burden | Capacity Constraints | Comfort &#x26; Capability Challenges |
|------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------|
| “My business has gotten so large and administratively burdensome, I only have the capacity to work on renewals, which take far longer than they used to.” | “I have to hire more customer service team members to service my book, and increased plan switching has made serving our customers more difficult.” | “I have limited capacity to cross sell, and, even when I do, I’m not comfortable offering other products due to fear of making a mistake.” |

We acquire great agencies at fair multiples across target segments

| $5M paid upfront, remaining held in escrow and trued up based on book size in May 2026. |                  |                |                |
| Remaining payments paid out in three equal payments in June of 2026, 2027, and 2028. |                  |                |                |

# Wedge Market

Execute where others struggle, and move up market over time

| Category                                   | Count   |
|--------------------------------------------|---------|
| US Insurance Agencies                       | 134,000 |
| MA, EB, &#x26; IFP Agencies                     | 33,500  |
| Southeast / Southwest Agencies              | 20,100  |
| Agencies Doing $1-$10M Revenue             | 6,633   |
| Independent Agencies in Category            | 5,306   |

We remain convicted that the Southeast and Southwest are target geos, but will likely expand to Midwest and/or Mountain West in mid to late 2026.

We will focus 2026 efforts on the $1-$10M revenue segment to both learn, but also to attack the segment where our peer group is less active.

This segment also remains heavily fragmented, with significant growth potential given their limited resources.

# Gyde Workflow Automation

Gyde enables a step change improvement in efficiency, and shifts the broker’s workflow from task inundation to renewal automation.

| Traditional Broker | Broker powered by Gyde AI | |
|--------------------|--------------------------|---|
| **Outreach**       | Initiate manual, high volume outreach to all renewing clients in a HIPAA compliant &#x26; CMS-approved workflow | AI outreach to all renewing clients — HIPAA compliant, CMS-approved, &#x26; personalized on behalf of the broker |
| **Follow Up**      | Chase renewing clients throughout AEP / OE to ensure they don’t miss their opportunity to change plans | AI-driven, non-deterministic follow ups targeted at clients who haven’t completed campaign goals |
| **Schedule**       | Schedule plan reviews with clients to discuss options— high volume coordination outside of traditional working hours | AI-scheduled plan reviews, leveraging integrations with each broker’s calendar and meeting preference configurations |
| **Prepare**        | Prepare for client plan reviews by collecting as much information as possible, but most fact finding happens during the plan review | AI-completed renewal assessment to gauge changes in client living, financial, &#x26; health situations prior to the plan review |
| **Meeting**        | Conduct ~1 hour client plan reviews - most result in passive, auto-renewals while others require an active plan change where the broker usually recommends the same 3-5 plans to every client. | 50% fewer plan reviews needed and reviews can now be completed in ~30 minutes. Meeting prep in minutes with Gyde AI’s summaries &#x26; transcripts, and plan recommendations are more personalized. |

Our AI platform amplifies strategic capacity, increasing the time spent on high leverage interactions and growth-focused tasks like new business development and cross sell.

# Building Promoters

"We had many suitors pursuing us but we ultimately decided to partner with Gyde because of our trust in their leadership, growth experience, technology abilities, and strategic partnership opportunities that are just not there within the other organizations in the industry!"

“From the first conversation, I could tell this team was different. They’re sharp, forward-thinking, and have a clear track record of building and scaling businesses the right way. What really stood out to me was their grasp on the numbers—not just financial projections, but how to turn strategy into real growth. More than anything, I trusted their vision and felt aligned with the way they move: fast, focused, and with purpose."
