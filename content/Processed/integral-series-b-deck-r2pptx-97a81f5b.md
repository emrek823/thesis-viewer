Unstructured hea
Ithcare data
lis worth billions.
But it's
incredibly difficult
to work with
!
Regulated
Every dataset requires
HIPAA Expert Determination
at least annually or
whenever data is
modified/refreshed.
!
Multimodal
Data is unstructured, and
composed of multiple
formats and types
(imaging, audio, text,
geospatial, etc)
!
Fragmented
Data is combined from
multiple sources, data
providers, and is incredibly
messy.
!
High volume
Healthcare data collection is
exploding year-over-year by
orders of magnitude*
THE PROBLEM
*Up to trillions from hundreds of millions of records produced annually.

```markdown
Al has unlocked previously inaccessible
insights from unstructured healthcare data
SURGING DEMAND FOR
DATA
Enterprises are purchasing
more and more unstructured
data to rapidly unlock
previously inaccessible
insights for commercial,
research, and Al use cases.
EXPLOSIVE SUPPLY OF
DATA
To feed the booming
enterprise demand, existing
data sellers are scaling their
supply and new data sellers
are entering the market.
INCREASED REGULATORY
SCRUTINY
With more activity, regulatory
scrutiny is one the rise.
Compliance standards and
exposure are an increasing
concern for enterprises.
