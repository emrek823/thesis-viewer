# Voice AI Solutions for Healthcare Sector

## Q&#x26;A Session

### Q: Have you explored voice AI solutions for your organization? If so, which solutions?
**A:** We selected PolyAI, but explored Assort, Superdial, and several other vendors prior to making a decision in the small key decision making group I am in.

### Q: Are you the chief decision maker for purchasing front-office technology for your organization?
**A:** Yes I am.

----

### Client
Hi, thanks for taking the time to chat about voice AI technologies for the healthcare sector. We saw that you are currently working with PolyAI, but also explored Assort Health and SuperDial. Maybe first, can you share a little bit about your role, your potential call center oversight or whatever the voice call function for scheduling looks like at your organization, the number of people or budget or however you want to quantify it?

### Expert
Yes. I work for a large DSO, but we also have medical offices as well that are supported now in the organization. In exploring a solution, it had to be able to eventually support what will be at that point, probably 1,200 locations. We have over 1,100 now.

There was a mass undertaking of exploring solutions that could be accounted for and rolled out across a large organization while meeting a standardization and allowing for reduced variability. All of this to be done at scale, both supporting our medical and our dental offices. A little bit more of a challenge than probably your average vendor or average client would be exploring and considering in this vendor exploration for voice AI solution.

### Client
Great. Do you know how many people the DSO employs now to handle scheduling and call center type work?

### Expert
We have a very large contact center where our office is getting anywhere from 200-400 calls a day. It's a very, very large list. Our offices are frontline and so the calls are not exclusively handled by a call center. A lot of DSOs and MSOs, they go directly to a call center, we don't. Our offices field a lot of those calls, which may not be as reflective as probably what you're looking for. Our contact center is probably at this point between all shifts and covering all the time zones, because we have offices across the United States, I would guess that we're probably upwards of 2,500 employees there.

### Client
Thank you so much. I'd love to hear a little bit more about what exactly you were looking for when you found Assort Health and these others. I'd love to hear a little bit about your evaluation process and what specifically you looked at. First, what the exact pain points were and what you were trying to solve for and what the historical process was and what you were trying to change.

### Expert
Yes. I think first point of consideration is interoperability. Depending on what the DSO or MSO has for their EHR or their PMS system, it really does limit the vendors that you're able to explore. Now, a lot of the vendors are getting more all-inclusive where they're able to hit on and operate within the confines of most of the major EHRs or PMSes. We were surprised to find out how many don't actually do so.

Frankly, because we are unique and we have dental and medical supported on the same platform, which is one of the only across the entire country, that made it even a bigger challenge. That being said, from there, the pain points that we're trying to address because of this is of course you have staffing shortages. A ton of this is manual labor, manning the phones. It's a huge financial burden. It takes a lot of people to do so.

It also is a huge risk for patient experience. Is there great customer service? How do you reduce variability in obtaining the right information from that patient? How do you expeditiously serve that patient? How do you train your contact center reps to maintain customer service no matter the caller's state? Having the ability to reduce dropped call times, reduce wait times are all points of consideration.

That all ties to the financial outcomes. Are we actually converting and serving the patient? Are we maintaining their customer satisfaction? Are we ensuring that we're serving the people to get appointments on the schedule or get the patient addressed so that they can come in and have their treatment done? It impacts upstream and downstream in every way from a financial perspective. Those are all the pain points.

It's also a huge point of consideration of where do you staff these people. We don't have remote workers and so very much a huge burden on just having a contact center facility that is large enough to support these people and the infrastructure that that takes. If you're able to reduce that by putting in a solution like an AI solution, you can hit it from all points. You can ensure that there's a level of customer service. You can ensure that those wait times and those response times are addressed quickly and really ensure those financial outcomes that you're looking for.

## Client
Okay. It sounds like your process, you were looking for an AI solution to support with the call center work.

## Expert
Most certainly. We didn't want a solution that just was our call center. It sounds like that's what your research is targeting. We want to have it where there's a solution that can serve in other areas. We don't want to end up with five solutions. We would like one solution that is either evolving over time to meet other use cases within the organization or already can.

## Client
Okay. When you say use cases, so you wanted one solution, but what type of solution, I suppose? I'm trying to get a sense of were you looking for a voice AI tool to take calls of any kind, front office, back office, etc., or what specifically were you looking to purchase?

## Expert
Yes. Ours is a phased approach, but I think there are a few things that are definitely of consideration in the subsequent phases. Having an initial solution for inbound calls that could hit on all those pain points that I spoke about was really, really critical. An AI solution that could take those inbound calls and have specific use cases built out to handle the most simple of calls.

We understand there's still going to be some call complexity that'll have to be routed to one of our team members and that's completely fine. There's a lot of standardization to the calls that are coming in from the DSO's perspective. We weren't just using this to schedule just appointments. We did see a lot of vendors who said, "We schedule appointments at a very high rate," and that's wonderful.

We also get things like refill requests and we get things like, "When was my last perio maintenance visit?" and "We want a records request," or there's some very specific standardized use cases that are a large majority of our calls that we wanted to make sure could be served by this AI as well.

In addition, to answer the second part of your question, so then we were also looking for what could happen as far as outbound calls. We do a lot of confirmation, we do a lot of scheduling because you have an open treatment plan that has been unfulfilled. Could you potentially use this for outbound AR calls? You're calling a patient to let them know that they have a balance. You're trying to collect that balance. Just patient engagement. We have a promotion or it's a Heart Health Awareness month and we're trying to get all of our...

## Main Text

Patients scheduled for their perio maintenance visits. There's a lot of outbound patient engagement that you want to use the solutions for.

In addition, we do charting. Charting is a huge pain point for our providers. When you're receiving patient messages, having the ability to go in and scrub the patient portal such that a lot of those messages could be responded to with AI responses is critical, or having an AI solution like a dictation solution where the provider hygienist could actually call out the perio charting or dictate into for certain treatment standardizations that would allow for their notes to be taken expeditiously. That to be learned such that if I have this particular patient and this particular profile that goes into the chart automatically. We were looking for a robust solution. Not all are able to meet all of those needs.

**Client**
That's really helpful. Which organizations, which platforms did you evaluate in this search?

**Expert**
We looked at Assort Health, PolyAI. jumping out of my head. We looked at SuperDial and we did an RFP on Luma Health and Olive.

**Client**
Great. How did you come to this group of five?

**Expert**
We needed a solution that could interact with Epic honestly and that could have specific customized use cases. What we found in diving into this space was there was a lot that are very healthcare-driven and they had specific healthcare use cases, the primary care use cases, but then they couldn't meet the needs of the customizations for a dental solution or conversely the other way around.

They have use cases already built out for dental, nothing for primary care. They weren't going to be able to meet that need or it was going to be a huge customization time, lift and build attached to getting a solution along where we needed it to be. In addition, interoperability of being able to work directly with our EHR was super important and Epic is a finicky one. They don't allow for a lot of interoperability. That limited the opportunities.

We actually explored a few solutions before we realized that they wouldn't have interoperability with Epic. In addition, safety and security is super, super high on our list. Ensuring that HIPAA compliance and that all the appropriate measures have been taken to pass our security standards is super rigid. Certain vendors got weeded out in the process because they didn't meet the standard security measures that our company requires before we can even explore a vendor.

**Client**
Would you be wanting to go through each of these, maybe starting with Assort Health and share the strengths, the things that you really liked, the areas that you were not so happy with and where it fell in pricing?

**Expert**
Yes. I'll be honest, I don't have all the pricing specifics. Some of them were very careful to not engage in that until you were almost on a letter of intent type of thing, which was interesting.

**Client**
I would love to know if that was part of the equation.

**Expert**
Yes. Most certainly a part of the consideration. Some were very tight-lipped to that. Assort was great. The other point before I go vendor by vendor, I'll tell you is a lot of them were all very vanilla. They all could...

## Transcription

serve basic needs. Some had longer ramp times for optimizations or for implementations. Assort was one of the quickest. That was very appealing about Assort is they already had use cases built out and they touted from the first initiation of exploration that they were fastest to launch, fastest from contract signage to go live. That's very important.

They were able to address all the pain points and meet all the needs. They were able to be customized. There was no issue with expanding upon the use cases that we needed. There were some cost considerations in that customization that needed to be explored further.

We didn't ultimately move forward down to that level with them, but it was a we can but we were not going to talk about what that would cost yet. We didn't get far enough along with them. They were very much one of the top from a client experience perspective during the process. They were one of the most responsive and most detail-oriented about what their solution had to offer and where the company was going as far as evolution of their technology and so forth.

### Client
Great. Were there things that you did not like about Assort Health?

### Expert
There wasn't really. There were some pieces about the pricing that left something to be desired, but you had to have a standard pricing. We are a high-growth organization and so with all of the vendors it's always very important that we are negotiating a tiered contract that allows for reduction in fees as we continue to grow. The vendor relationship is going to grow as the company grows and we have heavy, heavy growth plans. Some of the vendors were not willing. It was going to be a standardized contract and they weren't willing to negotiate a tiered based on growth parameters. That was a point of concern.

### Client
Great. Was there anything else that stood out with Assort that you liked or a reason that you dropped them?

### Expert                                     Sean Doolan
DO NOT COPY
No. They had the voice. Honestly,          sd@virtuevc.com
I can't remember right now if Assort had chat capabilities. That was a point
of consideration that we took in on this as well, is who was able to serve in a chat forum not just to scrub
patient messages coming across their patient portals, but also email that we had for the office or text
messaging system that we had. Honestly, I can't remember if Assort had one or not, but that was a key point
of consideration with some of these vendors as well for us.

### Client
Thank you. I'd love to hear maybe about SuperDial, Olive, and Luma and then we can talk about Poly,
because it sounds like Poly is the one you ended up going with.

### Expert
Yes. SuperDial was a little harder to ascertain information from. Honestly, they fell off our radar pretty quickly. Their solution was vanilla. Like I said, they seemed to be able to meet the need. One of the other concerns about Assort was with timing to this. It's a point of consideration. The AI is only as good as information has been put into it.

In some of these considerations with some of these vendors, the company life was shorter. We figured, "Okay, three years from now they're going to be excellent, but right now it's a little bit of a risk to know how much their AI actually knows or what we're going to have to teach it as an organization." That was one of the considerations on Assort as well before we move on.

SuperDial was along the same things. There was more rigidity to getting into specifics. The demo was done great and it was fine to move forward, but they were more tight-lipped about moving down that path with us without there being a stronger commitment. That's just not how our organization works. Analytics at an enterprise level and billables at an office level are a point of consideration as well. They fell off fairly quickly.

**Client**
What about Luma?

**Expert**
Luma, honestly, they works a lot with FQHCs. Why that was interesting to us is they do dental and medical FQHCs, although usually not truly integrated care, meaning they're not usually on the same EHR or PMS. They do have use cases on both sides, so using it for dental and for medical. That's why that was one of the vendors that was identified. They did have both sides of the system built out.

It was also going to take some custom considerations as well. They also specialized, if you will, they already had decks built out for both primary care and for specialty care. That was important to us. Some of these vendors that we explored were more tailored to hospital systems or larger groups. To say that their library for primary care was expanded upon wasn't. It was really targeted around specialty care and we don't provide specialty care. That was a point of consideration as well. That's one of the attractions to Luma.

From a pricing perspective, because they had the use cases, we weren't going to have to do a lot of customizations and that was nice. Their time to implement was going to be a little bit longer. They had a delay in backlog of new clients, and so there would've been a delay in that process and then actually getting it to implementation would've been a longer period than we were looking to explore.

**Client**
Do you know what that time period was, the time they would require to implement? What felt like it was too long for you?

**Expert**
If I remember correctly, I think that they had a backlog of clients that was a few months and they would say we would start doing the build and then it was 90-120 days. That for us wasn't going to work.

**Client**
Okay. How soon did you need a solution to get up and running? What would've been an appropriate time scale?

**Expert**
Most certainly we would want to start build and do the kickoff right after contract execution. We didn't want to have to wait to do the project planning, if you will, and time that all out. We want to know when we have to tag in every department and have it project planned to get it over the line. Because we're a larger organization, we can't roll it out across the company, we roll it out in regions. The actual rollout for us, it takes a long time. For us having anything greater than 90 days from contract to actual go live, especially in a solution like this where there's not customization to the build, it's not very complex. It is more of a plug-and-play module, if you will, seemed unreasonable.

**Client**
Great. Is there anything else on Luma Health you think is worth sharing?

**Expert**
They were really comprehensive, I would say. I think they really focused on patient engagement and operational efficiencies. They also were able to meet some of the analytics that we were looking for. As I expressed the challenge of being able to see who's calling, why are they calling, that is very important to us as an organization. Some of these wouldn't.

They have basic call information that our contact center would have, so how many calls are incoming, how long are they on hold, what's the abandonment rate? They weren't able to custom tailor to tell us who's calling.

actually calling. That improves use cases going forward. If we can somehow report on how many appointments are scheduling, then we can track appointment conversions.

If we can see how many patients are calling to see if we offer specialty care, whatever it is, then we can improve upon what customers or what callers are looking for and we can improve the AI as well. They were able to do that at a better level than some of the others.

**Client**
Do you recall if Assort Health had that?

**Expert**
Assort, I do believe that they could do further custom reporting. I think where their challenge was is we need enterprise-level and office-level reporting. We have an owner dentist model and so we care about every single practice's metrics. As an organization from the DSO enterprise level, we care about the enterprise and then our billables, we do the same thing at chem. The enterprise-level billables, we have to have billables that are broken down to the individual office level. There was some challenges in them wrapping their heads around those asks without there being additional expenses.

**Client**
I see. What about Olive Health?

**Expert**
Olive, they really touted coming from a point of reducing inefficiencies, so how could we really focus on repetitive tasks? It was more limited in what they were able to address unless we wanted to do greater customization and really partner with them on building the solution. This is a plug-and-play. We really were looking for a solution that could feed to us and give us what we needed and then still allow for the ongoing optimization as opposed to us having to really, really get into the weeds prior to even go live. That was why we didn't explore Olive much further.

**Sean Doolan**

**Client**
Okay. PolyAI, ultimately you ended up with this one. What did you see that stood out for you and what are areas of improvement and pricing for Poly?

**Expert**
Yes. PolyAI for us was one, it works very well with Salesforce and with we use that for a lot of others, solutions within the organization and also was compatible and interoperable with Epic. It was going to meet all of those needs. While we are plugging in the use cases and really, really getting it customized, they were very customer-centric into what we needed that was individual to us as a vendor. They could do all of the reporting and it would be fairly plug and play with our other solutions and it wouldn't just talk to our EHR, but it also would talk to other software applications that we use to support the organization. We also found that that was a challenge.

Some of these solutions, they may interoperate with our EHR, but they wouldn't with our patient engagement platform for instance, or we couldn't utilize it for revenue cycle if we wanted to do outbound patient AR calls, things like that. Those are, even if not immediate use cases, things that we want to be able to explore in the future.

There were limitations on those. PolyAI met all of those needs. They were able to get in right away with us and meet the timelines that we were looking for. All in all, they also were very willing to negotiate. They understand what we are as a vendor and what our growth is. They were the most receptive to really moving down that pathway with us.

**Client**
When you say most receptive there, do you mean with pricing?

# Expert Discussion on AI Solutions

## Participants
- **Expert**: Sean Doolan
- **Client**: [Name not provided]

----

### Discussion Points

**Client**: Great. When you said the connectivity with all of the other different tools that you're using and those integrations with rev cycle, patient engagement, other things beyond Epic, is that something that any of the other platforms, Assort, SuperDial or Luma could do?

**Expert**: Assort did. Assort had some, I don't remember if it was specific to legacy Salesforce, but they were able to interact with and actually brought that out before we even went down that path, they were able to operate with some of the other key solutions that are used in the dental space or in the healthcare space. Like I said, patient engagement platforms, they were able to do some additional things to even potentially eliminate one of the vendors that we use and probably several vendors that other DSOs and MSOs would use because they were able to accomplish that through their one solution.

**Client**: Okay. It sounds like out of all of these solutions, PolyAI and Assort Health were the most robust for your needs and that perhaps PolyAI had the clearest pricing for you. Is that a correct assessment?

**Expert**: Yes, I would definitely agree with that statement.

**Client**: Okay. Was there anything else you think that differentiated the two?

**Expert**: Honestly, with this AI solution, there isn't a whole lot of variability. They both met security and compliance things that we look for as an organization. Like I said, probably Assort if they were a little more forthcoming and competitive, and if you will, engaging on that contract negotiation piece.

PolyAI was very willing, even if they didn't have it, they were willing to go like on the use cases as an example and go to the drawing board and then bring that to us. Some of these vendors weren't. They were like, "You guys get us." Why are we paying you for customizations if it's work that we're having to do? There was just a little greater of a partnership there because then they can take and sell it in the marketplace as well. It's a win-win. I think PolyAI came at that.

**Client**: How hard would it be to switch from PolyAI to Assort if Assort were to come back at you with great pricing and all of the same functionality. Now that you've picked Poly, would it be easy or difficult to switch to another solution?

**Expert**: It wouldn't be difficult because it's not field facing, meaning this solution is layered on and the offices don't necessarily even know and understand it. It's an enterprise level that the change would take place. Short of just the build time and the implementation time, it's not like the build is using this other than how did they get messages or how do they get the calls transferred that are more complex. That's one piece we didn't talk about. If there is a call that the AI is not able to address, it does have to roll over to one of our humans whether that's a call center or whether it's our frontline offices to be able to service it. When it rolls over, it's a complex case.

You don't want the patient to have to explain why they just got transferred and it's a complexity. You have to have some type of a messaging system such that it's readily available and quick so that the person who's answering the phone already knows what the situation is and can be prepared to answer and greet and...

# Transcript

## Client
Okay. Which solutions? Did Assort have that?

## Expert
Assort did. I don't remember how it messaged the office. I don't remember if we were able to use. What we were looking for is almost like a Teams type of message, an instant message that would pop up tied in their EHR or not. It's best if it could actually come through the EHR where it pops up and you're already in the patient's chart. That interoperability of you don't have to then ask the patients for their information, it actually pops up readily there with the message so that you can address it immediately. That was PolyAI does really well.

## Client
Okay. Would you be willing to pay north of $100,000 a year?

## Expert
Most certainly. We pay way more than that for our contact center now. If you're able to reduce that administrative burden, Assort puts it right on their website, their predictability of reducing administrative burden and therefore subsequent people cost is I can't remember, 65% or something. That actually proves out.

We know the math on how much our contact center costs, we know the math on abandonment rates. It's just the offset from that, what's the financial return that makes this an upside, gives this an upside. Most certainly. Also, is it a per-call volume that you are paying? Is it a lump sum by office? Those are also considerations.

Some of our offices get a ton of calls and so having it be a per call may not be as appealing versus a blanket package of so many calls, let's say, across the region or across an enterprise. Some of those considerations are what we took into account and some of those considerations are what the vendors couldn't service. It wasn't based on serving small DSOs, single-unit offices and large DSOs.

You could tell that they were very centered to who their current customer base was and it was one or the other. That doesn't work. There's going to be organizations that want a call bundle. 5,000 calls for X sum of money or just a flat fee. For every office, this flat fee per month or some of them were very stringent on a per-call basis. That's really hard because patients will call and call and call. You may pay for a patient to call five or six times a day. Those are some considerations as well.

## Client
Well, this was super helpful. Thank you for your time and hope you have a great day!
