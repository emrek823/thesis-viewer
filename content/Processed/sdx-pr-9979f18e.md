What are the key points we want to get across?

RCM is one of the most saturated categories of pitch we get - so why SDX?

What about the specific SDX approach?

Why this team specifically?

What did we hear/see in the pitch that we did not in the 1000+ other RCM pitches?

Data Access (ease of data access - Gerald comments), clean integration (can sit on top of existing CDI software such as 3M & Iodine, doesn’t require EHR integration, etc.)

clear and immediate top-line ROI to hospitals/systems (who have razor thin margins), high exec receptivity to non-clinical AI use cases, peer credibility (Mike used to be on CDI teams, knows CDI language, native understanding - healthcare sells to healthcare : CDI sells to CDI), etc.

Spent ~2 years toiling/building company foundation prior to seed round → solid foundation to then achieve PMF → fast scale.

Positioning value prop as revenue driver vs. cost-savings. ~10K CDI nurses in the US * $150k = $1.5B. Positioning as a cheaper alternative to replace humans would fundamentally place a ceiling on potential value capture.

Marrying counterfactual modeling (technical approach) with differential diagnosis (clinical approach) that brings together clinician data scientist background. (link 43:50 on). The patient was given haloperidol, had an MRI of brain, and little bit disoriented = metabolic encephalopathy. Is this chronic psychosis? Metabloc encephalopathy. Differential diagnosis and counterfactual model interpretation. Do these data points satisfy the criteria? Is the wrong question. The correct question is - is this the best explanation for data points?

Business model and wedge dependent on product excellence. Conf with pre-bill CDI on top of current systems.

SmarterDx: Why We Invested

Clinical intelligence + Time-to-value = Hard ROI

Origin Story: Laying Foundation for Future Scale

Michael Gao and Joshua Gerelis first met at New-York Presbyterian hospital where the idea for SmarterDx first started to take form. Outside of their shared entrepreneurial journeys prior to becoming practicing hospitalists, Michael and Josh both had a vision to take what they were doing beyond the 4 walls of NYP. In early 2020, they formed the company to take their learnings from NYP to hospitals around the country. It wasn’t until the summer of 2021 that they received their first small consulting contract to fund product development. The nuance and learnings over the 12-18 months of the company journey laid the foundation for future growth.

Clinical documentation Integrity (CDI) is Key Bottleneck

Revenue cycle management (RCM) is a $120B market including everything form patient access, prior auth, and patient financial engagement on the front-end, to utilization review, discharge planing, CDI and coding in the mid-cycle, and claim submission, denials management, and billing on the back-end. Starting with CDI was not only a natural extension of Michael’s previous work at NYP, but a strategic wedge to become the source of truth

Image / describe pre-bill CDI. Some might ask - is this too niche?

CDI is both broad and clinically deep. For HCC coding for risk adjustment, you are focused on a known list of HCC-eligible conditions. Utilization management can be burdensome because of tight turnaround times but reviews specific services (e.g., admissions, imaging studies, procedures) against known clinical guidelines to authorize or deny coverage with discrete questions (“Is this admission medically necessary?”). CDI, especially in the inpatient setting,is a complex process that requires ingestion of 30,000 clinical data points, ranging from patient encounters, patient demographics, vital signs and flowsheets, laboratory and imaging results, clinical notes, ADT data, and prior CDI queries and results.

Early Technical Build

The early technical approach for SmarterDx mapped to Michael and Josh’s clinical training to develop a differential diagnosis using M.E.A.T. criteria. In the AI world, differential diagnosis can be equated to counterfactual modeling. If you have a patient that was given haloperidol, had an MRI of brain, and little bit disoriented, it technically could satisfy the criteria for metabolic encephalopathy. “Do these data points satisfy the following criteria?” is the wrong question, however. Instead, you should ask “Is the best of all possible explanations for the following data points? And why?”. This seemingly slight nuance is not only clinically relevant but is necessary because SmarterDx is looking for the 1% of additional diagnoses that exist in a sea of data. Without this approach, hospitals are losing millions of revenue.
