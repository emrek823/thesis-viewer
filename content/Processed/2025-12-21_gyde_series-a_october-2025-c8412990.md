## Slide 3: Vision and Belief

We believe the broker should be a
**comprehensive guide** for consumers and
employers across **insurance, wealth, and**
**health needs**—

and a **critical partner** to risk-bearing
entities as they seek to manage the
populations they serve.

## Slide 4: Background

Brokers are the
**entry and triage**
**point** to healthcare,
insurance, and other
financial products
but remain
underappreciated
and underleveraged

**Client (Consumer & Employer) Quotes & Needs:**
*   My partner and I just had a baby, and I need a life insurance policy. What do you recommend?
*   I'm turning 65 next year. Can you help me find a Medicare policy?
*   I just received a claim from my provider that I don't understand. Can you translate for me?
*   The fully insured rate increases are crippling us. What options do we have to find savings?
*   I haven't received my ID card and not sure that my coverage has effectuated. Can you help?
*   Can you help me find an in-network provider who accepts my new health plan?

*   Middle-inner: Broker
*   Inner: Client (Consumer & Employer)

## Slide 5: Problem - Operational burdens put service and scale at odds, hindering growth and suppressing the value they could provide

*   **Rising Administrative Burden**
    “My business has gotten so large and administratively burdensome, I only have the capacity to work on renewals, which take far longer than they used to.”
*   **Capacity Constraints**
    "I have to hire more customer service team members to service my book, and increased plan switching has made serving our customers more difficult.”
*   **Comfort & Capability Challenges**
    “I have limited capacity to cross sell, and, even when I do, I'm not comfortable offering other products due to fear of making a mistake."

## Slide 6: Solution

Brokers need a **partner.**

Gyde is building a **brokerage transformation machine**
to deliver unprecedented economic value for the
brokerage and deeper risk-bearing entity partnerships.

## Slide 10: LOI Snapshot - We acquire great agencies at fair multiples across target segments

**Protecting Against Subsidy Expiration:**
$5M paid upfront, remaining held in escrow and trued up based on book size in May 2026. Remaining payments paid out in three equal payments in June of 2026, 2027, and 2028.

*\*2025 Revenue is ~$70M but we assume decline due to expected subsidy expiration*

## Slide 11: Wedge Market - Execute where others struggle, and move up market over time

*   We remain convicted that the Southeast and Southwest are target geos, but will likely expand to Midwest and / or Mountain West in mid to late 2026
*   We will focus 2026 efforts on the $1-$10M revenue segment to both learn, but also to attack the segment where our peer group is less active
*   This segment also remains heavily fragmented, with significant growth potential given their limited resources

| Category                           | Count     |
| :--------------------------------- | :-------- |
| US Insurance Agencies              | 134,000   |
| MA, EB, & IFP Agencies             | 33,500    |

| Agencies Doing $1-$10M Revenue     | 6,633     |
| Independent Agencies in Category   | 5,306     |

| **Meeting**    | Conduct ~1 hour client plan reviews – most result in passive, auto-renewals while others require an active plan change where the broker usually recommends the same 3-5 plans to every client. | 50% fewer plan reviews needed and reviews can now be completed in ~30 minutes. Meeting prep in minutes with Gyde AI's summaries & transcripts, and plan recommendations are more personalized. |

**Output of Gyde AI:** Our AI platform amplifies strategic capacity, increasing the time spent on high leverage interactions and growth-focused tasks like new business development and cross sell

**Key Assumptions**

*   **M&A Velocity**
    M&A activity in the model assumes 1 transaction in 2025, 4 in 2026, 12 in 2027, 18 in 2028, and 24 deals annually in both 2029 and 2030.
*   **Annual Growth**
    Gyde assets grow at 25-30% annually (2.5-3x market).
*   **Margin Expansion**
    Margin grows to 45% over a three to four year transformation (2-2.5x market).
*   **Multiple Arbitrage**
    Achieve 2x multiple arbitrage, acquiring assets for 8-12x EBITDA or 2.5-3x revenue, and trade at 20x EBITDA ($AJG and $GSHD TTM at low to mid 20s) or 5-6x revenue.
*   **Product Launch Timing**
    Wealth Management and Clinical Data & Engagement launch in years 2027 and 2028 respectively.
*   **Leverage**
    Leverage ratio increases in 2027 and 2028 to enable M&A velocity.

## Slide 22: Building Promoters

We've talked to upwards of 100
agency owners who have sold,
and **none had positive things**
**to say about the experience**

Gyde is doing it differently,
and we will build a wildly
promotional owner base
because of it.

**Quotes:**

*   "We had many suitors pursuing us but we ultimately decided to partner with Gyde because of our trust in their leadership, growth experience, technology abilities, and strategic partnership opportunities that are just not there within the other organizations in the industry!"
*   “From the first conversation, I could tell this team was different. They're sharp, forward-thinking, and have a clear track record of building and scaling businesses the right way. What really stood out to me was their grasp on the numbers—not just financial projections, but how to turn strategy into real growth. More than anything, I trusted their vision and felt aligned with the way they move: fast, focused, and with purpose."
