**Call me? Initiating Neutral as we see upside optionality, but limited visibility**
Initiating Coverage: NEUTRAL | PO: 44.00 USD | Price: 39.87 USD

**Call option on 20%+ growth value based care industry**
We see the investment case for AMEH as a 'call option' on the value based care industry. Having already proven the model in Southern California, the company is already generating ample free cash today, with enough local scale to have built a defensible moat around the core earnings base. However, the company is only now beginning to export the model into new geographies, which bears significant execution risks, in our view. For example, management sees flat EBITDA growth into 2023 driven by investments in new markets, for which there could be compelling upside case, but since there is no historical precedent of exporting the model at AMEH, our visibility on its ability to earn those returns on investment is still limited, leaving us Neutral. Our $44 PO (10% potential upside) is based on 17.5x our 2024E EV/EBITDA estimate and supported by a 10YR DCF using a 11% discount rate on unlevered FCF and 13x exit multiple.

**Large TAM, track record of profitability, flexible model**
AMEH is positioned within the highest growth subsector in our coverage (value-based care), which we estimate will grow at a 20%+ revenue CAGR over the next decade. Unlike its peers, AMEH has a long (25+ year) track record, hovering near target margins on a consolidated basis, having proven the model in its core market of Southern California, despite a diverse payer mix (across Medicaid, Commercial and Medicare), at relatively large (>1m member) scale. Finally, as AMEH is generating ample free cash flow, with negative net debt, it has the balance sheet to reinvest more aggressively into growth while other companies (facing financing pressures) are pulling back.

**Risks: Unproven exportability, limited visibility**
The biggest risk to the AMEH story is its limited experience in exporting its model beyond its core market. While there are some early signals of momentum, there aren't as many proof points on exportability vs peers such as AGL or OSH. Meanwhile, AMEH's payer diverse enablement model leads to accounting nuances which make the GAAP financials more difficult to compare vs peers. Having in part relied on M&A for growth, adds deal integration risk. Finally, most of AMEH's profits come from government payers which exposes the company to regulatory risk.

### Company Sector
Physician Practice Management

### Company Description
Apollo Medical (AMEH) is a physician enablement company that aims to streamline administrative functions for providers, and maximize practice economics by shifting the focus to value based care. What makes AMEH unique is its ability to work across all payers (vs peers who largely focus on Medicare products). Additionally, the company has a uniquely long track record (25+ years), and has proven its unit economics by generating target margins on a consolidated basis.

### Investment Rationale
Having proven the model in Southern California, AMEH is already generating ample free cash today, with enough local scale to have built a defensible moat around the core earnings base. Meanwhile, it is only now beginning to export the model into new geographies, which bears significant execution risk, but requires minimal capital investment. Therefore, we see limited downside, with potential for upside if it can replicate results in new markets, although visibility is constrained.

### Company overview

Apollo Medical (AMEH) is a physician enablement company that aims to streamline administrative functions for providers and maximize practice economics by shifting the focus to value based care. What makes AMEH unique is its ability to work across all payers (vs peers who largely focus on Medicare products), having already found traction in Medicaid, Commercial, ACO REACH and Medicare Advantage. Additionally, the company has a uniquely long track record (25+ years) and has proven its unit economics by generating target margins on a consolidated basis.

AMEH uses its technology and employed care teams to identify gaps in care, better document health status, identify high value external specialists, and financially encourage intervention where appropriate to improve outcomes and lower costs. The company also contracts with MCOs in a way that allow AMEH and the provider group to share in the upside created by these cost savings. By partnering with existing physician practices, which are already profitable, AMEH is able to grow while generating cash, with minimal capex or startup costs.

### MSO / Technology overview

AMEH's corporate history dates back 1994, when the company was founded under the name 'Network Medical Management' or NMM which was purely an MSO. According to AMEH's website, Management services organizations (MSOs) 'provide management, administrative and other non-medical support services to medical companies and IPAs (independent physician associations)'. Some of these services include, but are not limited to billing, collections and human resources which we outline in more detail below.

### Managing all administrative functions of a practice

At a high level, the MSO promises to streamline all of the administrative functions a provider group would normally need to manage, while allowing the doctors who own the practice to focus on providing the best care to patients.

### Services include outsourced back-office functions, marketing

These services include back-office functions like customer service, managing the IT department and various technology vendors, building a website and managing patient records in a HIPPA compliant way, helping doctors negotiate rates with insurance companies, resolving claims disputes with members, and ensuring regulatory compliance such as proper credentialling. Additionally, the MSO helps recruit and manage staff, while actively marketing to find new patients.

### Additional services include broad based care management

Aside from purely administrative functions, the MSO also helps doctors with medical care management by employing case managers to help route patients to needed resources (such as food stamps or other social benefits), creating, and adhering to quality metrics, connecting patients to owned provider assets (AMEH owns some surgery centers, labs, urgent care clinics), and route patients to lower cost/higher value care settings.

### Contracts can last 3-30 years, earn 25-30% margins

Through the MSO, AMEH enters into arrangements to provide these services to provider groups under 'master service agreements', which are typically written with 3-30 years terms, which are ‘generally not terminable by our affiliated IPAs and medical groups except in the case of bankruptcy, fraud, or other illegal acts by the contracting MSO'. Through the agreement, AMEH gains exclusive authority over non-medical decisions related to business operations. Rather than charging a fixed fee for these services, AMEH generally collects a 'take rate' which ranges from 8-12% of the provider groups' total revenue/cash collections. AMEH records this revenue as 'management fee income'. For these services, AMEH generally earns a 25-30% EBITDA margin.

It's worth pointing out AMEH's closest public peer, Privia Health (PRVA), has a similar business line which earns management fees on practice collections. However, PRVA's customers are generally still operating under fee-for-service in those arrangements while AMEH's customers are generally already in value based care.

### Over time, MSO business has become smaller contributor

Despite the company being founded around the MSO business, it only represents ~11% of revenues today and just 8% of EBITDA (when assuming target margin on reported revenue), down from 8% of revenue and 23% of EBITDA in 2016. This is due to the company shifting its focus towards value based care offerings while ramping the earnings on those arrangements.

### Value-based 'IPA' Overview

In 1999, NMM entered into a 30 year MSO agreement with a large physician network named 'Allied Pacific of California' or APC. Due to the tight integration of NMM and APC, accounting rules required that NMM report APC as a consolidated subsidiary (with all of APC's financials flowing through NMM's consolidated reporting). Through this deep partnership, eventually AMEH began to shift its focus towards value based care, which AMEH refers to as its 'consolidated IPAs'.

### IPA shifts economics from revenue cycle to insurance

Rather than accepting a fixed percentage share of overall provider practice revenue under the MSO model, the IPA or value based model instead takes over the risk and responsibility of medical costs (which it reports as revenue) from the insurance companies representing the patients, and earns a profit by keeping medical costs below the insurer's own spending benchmark. In effect, AMEH shifts the economic model from that of a revenue cycle management company towards that of a health insurer.

### Affiliate model helps external provider groups take risk

In most cases, AMEH enters into IPA (and MSO) arrangements with external, non-owned provider groups, also known colloquially as 'affiliates'. Essentially, AMEH provides these affiliate groups with all of the same technology and infrastructure built into the MSO offering outlined in the section above, as well as greater focus on medical management tools/clinical staff and access to value based contracts with insurance companies. Importantly, AMEH backstops all of the downside risk (of medical costs going above the benchmark) for the provider group.

AMEH, in partnership with the affiliate then assumes the underwriting risk (medical costs) of the patient and becomes responsible for managing down third party medical expenses. Notably, since in most cases AMEH does not own the affiliate, it is not responsible for any of the costs of running the clinics. Instead, the affiliate divides the gross profit or Medical Margin (Premiums - Third Party Medical Expenses) in half with the provider group. After applying a modest amount of corporate overhead AMEH is left with ~15% EBITDA margins.

| EBITDA                       | $128         | (Approximate final EBITDA, likely meant to be $150-($75+$5) = $70, but chart shows $128 for "Affiliate level profit" and "EBITDA" after $5 Center Expense and $128 Corporate overhead, which is confusing. Based on calculation $150 (Affiliate level profit) - $75 (Physician Share) - $5 (Center Expense) - $128 (Corporate Overhead) = -$58 EBITDA).                                    |

*Re-interpreting chart: If $150 is the 'Affiliate level profit' after third-party medical expenses and physician partner share, and Center Expense is $5, then it is $150 - $5 = $145. If Corporate Overhead is $128, then $145 - $128 = $17. The chart shows $128 for Affiliate level profit and $128 for EBITDA, with $5 for Center Expense and $128 for Corporate Overhead, which implies $128 - $5 - $128 = -$5. There might be an error in chart labeling or an implicit division step missing. Based on the text "Affiliate keeps half... The other half goes to physician partner," and "After applying a modest amount of corporate overhead AMEH is left with ~15% EBITDA margins", and the first segment value "Premiums paid to MCO $1,200", and "Gross profit retained by MCO $150", and "Capitation rate paid to capitated affiliate $1,000", then "Third-party medical expenses $850". This means Gross Profit for Affiliate is $1000 - $850 = $150. "Half of the gross profit after paying out third party medical expenses" (which is $150) would be $75 to affiliate and $75 to physician partner. If AMEH's share is $75, then "Center Expense" $5, "Corporate overhead" $128. This results in $75 - $5 - $128 = -$58. The chart's visual representation of $128 as 'Affiliate level profit' seems to be a mislabeling for 'Medical Margin before Physician Partner Share and AMEH's own overhead'. I will extract the explicit bar values as shown, noting the potential discrepancy.*

Explicit Bar values:
*   Premiums paid to MCO: $1,200
*   Gross profit retained by MCO: $150
*   Capitation rate paid to capitated affiliate: $1,000
*   Third-party medical expenses: $850
*   Center Expense: $5
*   Physician Partner Share: $128
*   Affiliate level profit: $128 (This value for 'Affiliate level profit' should logically be higher than Physician Partner Share if it is *before* the share, or smaller if it is *after* some deductions for AMEH's portion but before corporate overhead. Given $128 for Physician Partner Share, if this is 50% of profit, total profit would be $256. If 'Affiliate level profit' is AMEH's portion, and it's $128, then this is 50% of the $256. This $128 bar seems to represent AMEH's share *before* its own internal costs.)
*   Corporate overhead: $128
*   EBITDA: $128

Let's re-interpret based on the text: "the affiliate divides the gross profit or Medical Margin (Premiums - Third Party Medical Expenses) in half with the provider group."
Medical Margin = Capitation rate paid to capitated affiliate ($1000) - Third-party medical expenses ($850) = $150.
Affiliate's half = $75. Physician Partner's half = $75.
Then AMEH's portion ($75) - Center Expense ($5) - Corporate Overhead ($?) = EBITDA.
The chart is illustrative and its labels are causing confusion. I will extract the values explicitly shown on the bars, which don't directly align with the $150 medical margin. The *text* description states: "AMEH, in partnership with the affiliate then assumes the underwriting risk (medical costs) of the patient and becomes responsible for managing down third party medical expenses. Notably, since in most cases AMEH does not own the affiliate, it is not responsible for any of the costs of running the clinics. Instead, the affiliate divides the gross profit or Medical Margin (Premiums - Third Party Medical Expenses) in half with the provider group. After applying a modest amount of corporate overhead AMEH is left with ~15% EBITDA margins."

The labels on the bars are:
*   Premiums paid to MCO: $1,200
*   Gross profit retained by MCO: $150
*   Capitation rate paid to capitated affiliate: $1,000
*   Third-party medical expenses: $850
*   Center Expense: $5
*   Physician Partner Share: $128
*   Affiliate level profit: $128
*   Corporate overhead: $128
*   EBITDA: $128

These numbers are self-contradictory if "Physician Partner Share" and "Affiliate level profit" are halves of the *same* gross profit, and then corporate overhead is applied to Affiliate level profit to get EBITDA. For clarity, I will list the exact values as they appear on the bars.

### However, affiliates harder to manage and align incentives

At first glance it would seem the affiliate model is better than building clinics as some major peers have done. The ability to earn similar margins without any capital expenditures or the cost of ramping capacity should result in a higher return on invested capital. And that can be true. In fact, this was the strategy many major MCOs have been using for most of the last decade in order to help drive volumes into value based care. However, finding willing and able partners in the right markets is more difficult than it sounds. Most geographies don't have providers with experience taking capitated risk. Even if you do find the right groups, they may not be entirely focused on Medicare Advantage, and would have more difficulty managing MLR, stars and risk scores. Finally, if a group is successful they may eventually push back on its contractual revenue share to lower its share of the profits or seek a different enablement partner.

### Allows physicians to retain ownership, M&A pipeline

Regardless of the puts and takes between ownership and affiliate models, both are finding a product market fit today, and AMEH engages in both models (though primarily focused on affiliates). This way, the company can buy practices or work with doctors don't want to work for a corporate enterprise and would rather maintain their existing ownership structure while working with a sophisticated external partner to take risk. For AMEH and other companies doing both (eg (competitors such as UNH/HUM/CANO/BHG), the affiliate market creates an M&A pipeline by introducing them to physicians groups and seeing how well they can manage risk.

### Doctors usually bring full patient panels, relationships

Unlike the clinic model, which requires staffing the center and finding new patients, the affiliate model generally onboards physicians who already have existing patient panels. This reduces the cost of acquiring revenue (AGL talks about 13:1 LTV to CAC) as a percentage, as well as avoids financial dilution of running a clinic with unfilled capacity. Therefore, by partnering with existing groups, an affiliate can build a network of physicians to rapidly achieve scale in a local market. As an added benefit, this brings built-in trust from existing relationships between the patient and provider, which can improve outcomes on an absolute basis.

### Providers can earn more doing less

Thus far, we have generally talked about the financial benefits from the perspective of AMEH. However, working with AMEH makes economic sense for these affiliate provider groups, some of which have been in business for decades, but have not been able to make value based care work. In our view, the value proposition from AMEH is straightforward, more money for less work. By shifting the practice to value based care, the practice can generate 13x revenue, and 2-3x earnings in the example below, even after reducing the patient panel size by 33%.

Of course, the crux of the model relies on being able to manage down medical costs to an economically sustainable level, which in this case we assume 70% for most payers (worse than what AMEH has been able to generate historically) and 85% for Original Medicare (it is more difficult to generate savings in programs such as ACO REACH and Medicare Shared Savings). In part, these savings are generated from AMEH's incremental services and consulting. However, another important element of the model is financially incentivizing doctors to spend more time with patients (reducing overall panel sizes) and less time on administrative work (outsourced to AMEH).

### AMEH needs to manage costs better than MCOs

Underpinning the economic model of these value based arrangements is the fact that with the right incentive, physician groups can manage down healthcare costs more efficiently than an MCO. AMEH invests significantly more into its care platform than the average fee for service physician, utilizing a proprietary IT platform, care teams, smaller patient panels (less G&A leverage), and back-office staff to coordinate and close gaps in care for the patient. According to AMEH they have been able to lower hospital admissions and ER visits 66%/77% more effectively than the FFS benchmark on their Medicare Advantage patients, which is critical to lowering costs as hospital spending is the largest bucket of overall healthcare spend, representing 44% of the average Medicare patient's expenditures.

### The higher the risk the higher the reward

Unlike in fee-for-service, value based care reimbursement is largely unrelated to how much market share a physician has in a market or even the fee-schedule itself. The more relevant driver of revenue is the amount of medical spending under management to drive shared savings off of, as well as the amount of risk the provider is taking.
Below we illustrate our estimate for what a typical provider should expect to generate in FFS revenues (before salary or clinic expenses) for each patient on an annual basis. We

# BofA GLOBAL RESEARCH

then compare the amount of medical margin (patient medical spending benchmark – actual medical spending-insurer portion – enablement company portion) a provider could generate if that provider switched to value based care and managed to an 85% MLR (medical margin is comparable to FFS revenue in this way because it represents the cash the provider can spend to pay salaries and clinic expenses).

Interestingly, when looking at things this way, it is clear why most value based models have focused on the high acuity population, because the FFS revenues conceivably may not be far off from what could be achieved in value based care, which exposes the provider to the risk of earning less. Instead, value based models work best when targeting the highest spending cohorts, from which to drive savings off of.

### Full-risk MA is most profitable, but not all groups can focus on it exclusively

Based on this, it is clear to us that running a physician practice exclusively focused on full capitation for the Medicare population is undoubtedly more profitable than a mixed patient panel or FFS patient base. However, AMEH is betting on the fact that not all provider groups are able to or willing to have such a narrow strategy, and instead AMEH aims to maximize the economics of a model that treats all types of patients.

### AMEH sees delegated claims as differentiator

Despite taking full risk for spending, most capitated providers are not actually responsible for paying out claims (the MCO does that and then periodically trues up payments to the doctor group to reflect the savings vs the benchmark that they generate). The downside of doing it this way is that the physician groups have limited visibility into how claims are developing in real time. However, some capitated providers (particularly in mature markets like California such as AMEH) actually are responsible for directly paying claims in what's called a 'delegated' model. AMEH believes that the delegated model can be a differentiator in expanding its integrated model into less mature markets.

### Increases payment speed, visibility into claims, ‘one check' for doctors

Under the delegated model, the capitated provider can take on responsibility for more Managed Care functions beyond just economic responsibility of medical claims. For one, delegated providers end up receiving premiums and paying out claims on a cash basis, which significantly increases the speed of the payment cycle and the visibility the capitated provider has into real time medical spending of a member.

Importantly, this allows AMEH to function as a flow through entity for all of a provider group's billings, allowing the provider to submit claims and receive reimbursement from a single entity rather than potentially dozens of different insurance companies on different schedules with different reconciliation processes.

# BofA GLOBAL RESEARCH

### Ability to approve prior authorization in real time, improve access

Additionally, by taking delegated claims the provider can also become responsible for prior authorization and claims adjudication. This is helpful because for example, if a patient wants to get an MRI they often need explicit authorization from the insurance company. By taking on prior authorization, the provider can almost instantly approve prior authorization requests (vs potentially days to hear back from the insurance company) and more quickly perform healthcare services during the same visit or immediately send someone to a specialist on the same day to increase compliance.

### Exerts more control and flexibility over external network

Finally, the last major advantage of taking delegated claims is that the provider can help refine the network of external providers (including rate negotiation, removing providers from network, utilization management, provider credentialing, care navigation, setting quality targets) who can now send claims directly to the delegated provider instead of having to deal with the policies of multiple separate insurance companies. If the delegated provider has specific referral sources it uses for its patient base, it can negotiate even lower rates vs the original MCO network, and encourage greater in-network steerage among its patient base.

### Go deeper: See our 140 page value based care primer

In the sections above we briefly touch on the key concepts behind AMEH's core business model, value based care. However, the industry itself is relatively esoteric and we believe requires a significant amount of context to fully understand, which we outline in much greater detail in our [140 page value based care primer, linked here](https://www.bofaml.com/content/dam/bofa/global-research/en/pdf/VBC_Primer.pdf).

In the report we cover the history of the fee-for-service (FFS) system, why value based care (VBC) could work this time, size the opportunity and growth, explain the nuances of reimbursement (including risk adjustment) and why Medicare works best, bridge how companies lower MLR and reach target margin, detail cash flow mechanics, provide an overview of key companies in the sector, examine transactions and public valuations, discuss possible points of strategic differentiation, as well as explain insurance accounting.

### Additionally, we address the most commonly asked questions from investors

Why have most companies focused on Medicare Advantage? Why not Commercial or Medicaid? How exactly do these companies save money? How can they earn a margin on 85% of premium? Why would a Managed Care plan work with them? Why not start their own MCO? Which model is better, owned versus affiliate? Aren't they just gaming risk codes? How differentiated is the technology? How much regulatory risk is there? What if regulators look to cap profits? What long term competitive advantages / economic moats are there? At what point do we shift from "everyone wins on industry growth" to "these companies start taking share from each other"? Why are the stocks so volatile?

### Management overview

Below we provide a brief overview of AMEH's current management team. One governance item which is worth pointing out is that the current co-CEO, Brandon Sim, is the son of Dr. Kenneth Sim, the long-standing Executive Chairman of the board since 2013. The chairman and other co-CEO Thomas Lam have a history as practicing physicians and have been involved in AMEH and the predecessor organizations for a decade or more. Meanwhile, the newer co-CEO Brandon Sim, was previously the COO, CTO and VP of engineering. Before that, Brandon worked as a quant analyst on Wall Street, and as a co-founder of a healthcare technology company. Finally, the current interim CFO Chan Basho has more 'traditional' industry experience having worked at other large healthcare services organizations such as ALHC and Healthcare Partners, which was acquired by DVA, and ultimately re-sold to UNH.

### Investment Positives

### Positioned within the highest growth HC services sector

In our view, the most obvious and sizable tailwind for AMEH is that the industry it focuses on, value based care, has a large and fast growing total addressable market. We estimate that in aggregate, the highest form of risk arrangements, full-capitation, represented just 11% of healthcare spending in 2022 which we could see ramping to 34% in 2030. In absolute dollar terms this would shift $420b worth of capitation payments to $1.9T, growing at a 21% CAGR.

"Total FFS" is not labeled with specific values on the chart, but it is implied to be the difference from a total sum (presumably the top of the $6,000B axis). However, as per the previous chart, Total FFS is 100% - Total Capitated %. So, for 2030, FFS would be 66% of total. If $1,925B is 34% of total, then total spending is $1,925B / 0.34 = ~$5,662B. FFS spending would be 0.66 * $5,662B = ~$3,737B. The chart is not providing explicit FFS values, only the cumulative bars with 'Total Capitated' segments labeled.*

### 'Field of dreams' model, if they build it, MCOs will come

In our view, the value based care model aligns the incentives between the provider and the MCO, which ultimately drives more volume into these models over time. Patients have little insight into the cost/benefit of health care services and managed care companies are one step removed from the patient's bed side. As a result, incentivizing doctors, who have the best understanding of the patient's needs, to think about the most cost-effective services while also incentivizing quality has significant potential to reduce costs and improve outcomes, in our view. Below we outline the key incentive alignments between the provider and the insurer under value based care.

1)  **Maximize Gross Profit** By law, MCOs have to spend 85% of premiums on medical costs (if costs fall below, the rebate the difference to the customer). By capitating risk to a provider an MCO is able to maximize its own gross profit by paying the doctor 85% of premiums, which shifting risk of cost spikes to the provider.

# BofA GLOBAL RESEARCH

2)  **Incentivize better coding** Now that the provider is getting paid as a % of premiums, the doctor has more incentive to document health status and risk code as higher risk adjusted payments from CMS get splits 15% to the MCO and 85% to the provider.
3)  **Rewards higher quality scores** High quality Medicare Advantage plans get paid a 5% bonus, and since the provider is getting paid a % of premiums, they are now incentivized to achieve higher quality scores.
4)  **Improves plan retention** Finally, if a patient is truly engaged by a key provider (such as a PCP) that patient is less likely to switch health insurers and risk losing their network, increasing retention.

### HUM highlights value of shifting to risk, MCOs demanding it

At their investor day in 2021 HUM helped quantify the impact on three of these four critical outcomes. In full risk arrangements (Owned, JV and Alliance) HUM saw 20% higher underwriting profit, 33% higher quality (stars) scores, 24% higher Net Promoter Scores (NPS) and -20% reduction in avoidable hospital admissions which each drive higher member retention. Essentially, by capitating away premiums an MCO such as HUM maximizes financial outcomes while almost entirely offloading risk. Therefore, MCOs are aggressively seeking to partner with providers who are able to accept full capitation arrangements, driving higher penetration in the sector.

### Economics relatively ‘proven' on a consolidated basis

One of the clearest points of differentiation AMEH has from its peers is that it has a relatively long history of delivering against its growth and margin targets on a consolidated basis. Many of the public peers (such as AGL, CANO and OSH) on the other hand, have been funding aggressive growth dilutively and therefore are not near their target profitability. Instead, those companies show investors cohort analysis performance, highlighting that early cohorts are performing well, with the hope that newer business will ramp at the same pace over time, such that eventually when enough of the business is matured, the consolidated financials should mirror those cohort numbers. While that thesis is valid, it is difficult for outside investors to fully trust these disclosures (could be cherry picked, manipulated, or simply not representative of future results).

Since AMEH had historically been contained to its core market of southern California, and had reached a mature scale in that market, the consolidated financials already show strong results, adding some visibility. Below we show some highlights of AMEH's key performance indicators. Notably the company has grown both revenue and EBITDA at a 25% CAGR vs 2016, while maintaining EBITDA margins within its 10-20% long term guidance range and a third party MLR ratio of 70% or lower.

### Consolidated results significantly better than peers

As mentioned above, these results are in contrast to those reported by many of the public peers. Below we highlight AMEH's consolidated MLR, COGS ratio and Adj. EBITDA margins over time vs some of these peers. Looking at things this way, AMEH has clearly 'outperformed' on these metrics. Though we note that it is heavily influenced by the fact that AMEH has chosen to contain growth to its mature markets. All of these peer companies talk about generating similar results on early cohorts, so to the extent those can be replicated, eventually the gap in these metrics should close. However, reporting these strong results on a consolidated basis within audited financials does add some additional visibility.

### NextGen ACO results add further confidence in effectiveness of model

One other proof point in the model we'd highlight are results from AMEH's participation in CMS's NextGen ACO program, which ran from 2016-2021, though AMEH joined in 2017. This program allowed doctors (enabled by AMEH) to take financial risk on Original Medicare patients (coverage through the federal government). For every year of participation except 2018, AMEH outperformed the program-wide savings rate, in many cases by a wide margin. Since this data is released by the federal government, is tested over time, and is tied to a program with relatively strict guardrails on company profits, we believe they add additional credibility to AMEH's ability to bend the cost curve. We note however, that membership was limited to 20-30k members vs the base of AMEH's 1m+ total, but given these are higher cost seniors, represented 14-20% of AMEH's spending under management during that time.

### NextGen ACO transitioned to ACO Reach in 14 states

Its worth mentioning that the NextGen ACO program ended in 2021, and as of 2022 AMEH had transitioned many of those same beneficiaries to the Direct Contracting (rebranded ACO REACH in 2023). As a result, the company is able to report all of the spending under management as revenue (due to different accounting rules) though the economic model is largely similar. Additionally, its worth flagging that both NextGen ACO and ACO REACH manages patients in 14 different states, despite AMEH's core focus being California. The company views ACO REACH as a good standalone business but also sees strategic value in building relationships with physicians before entering a market in a bigger way (which is the playbook it used in Texas).

### Model is working across a broad mix of patients

AMEH has a relatively unique mix of value based care base of membership. While most peers focus almost exclusively on Medicare patients, AMEH has a very heavy skew towards Medicaid. While the company does not break down its membership or spending under management by payer, we use its GAAP revenue mix disclosure (which is not fully comparable) and our own estimates to back into it.

### In total, we estimate nearly 65% of value based membership is related to Medicaid, while the remaining 35% is split roughly evenly between Medicare and Commercial. In 2021 AMEH did help quantify its membership mix saying roughly 3/4 of the members were in Medicaid, while 1/8 were in Commercial / Medicare respectively, which roughly aligns with our analysis. Taking it a step further, we backed into actual spending under management, of which we estimate just 27% is actually tied to Medicaid (since the members are younger and have low reimbursement) whereas 56% is related to Medicare and 17% is commercial.

### AMEH's payer mix more diversified than all of its public peers

Below we show how AMEH's value based membership and spending under management compares against the public peers, which highlights the unique nature of AMEH's diverse mix of business.

### Other companies focus on MA for a reason, but AMEH makes diversity work

Importantly, there is a reason many of the public peers focus on Medicare Advantage, which we outline in this chart below (and [walk through in more detail in our primer, see report](https://www.bofaml.com/content/dam/bofa/global-research/en/pdf/VBC_Primer.pdf)). In our conversation with the company it sounds like Medicaid margins are only slightly profitable for them, while commercial is higher, and Medicare by far being the highest. Despite the large exposure to 'suboptimal' business lines such as Medicaid and Commercial, AMEH has consistently been able to earn a 10-20% EBITDA margin on a consolidated basis, adding further credibility to the success they've had on managing margins across a diverse base of members.

### Sees ability to work across payers as a strategic advantage

AMEH acknowledges that different payers have different nuances and margin profiles. However, it believes that working across every major program is a strategic differentiator for a number of reasons.

1)  **Comprehensive solution to providers** Many provider groups would prefer to work with an enablement company that will allow them to shift its entire patient panel from fee-for-service to value based care, allowing the physician to practice the same way with every patient.
2)  **Increases TAM** This increases AMEH's TAM from just Medicare (we estimate $1.2T in spending by 2030) to nearly $2T by including Commercial and Medicaid.
3)  **Heightened focus could improve outcomes** AMEH believes that by allowing the physician to practice the same way for every patient, it should make them more effective at improving outcomes and savings money, rather than juggling different care philosophies.

# BofA GLOBAL RESEARCH

4)  **Negotiating leverage with MCOs** Finally, the company believes that working across payer types helps secure stronger network access and reimbursement rates from insurance companies, which each generally have membership across multiple programs, and would prefer to work with provider groups that can offer more comprehensive value based solutions.

### FCF positive, well capitalized with ample liquidity

The relatively recent phenomena of high interest rates raises the costs of external financing for all companies, but particularly those in higher growth industries subject to more risks. Therefore, in that backdrop, the value of internal financing, i.e. having a strong balance sheet with ample liquidity, is heightened. As discussed in the sections above, AMEH's focus on its core market of southern California has allowed the company to operate within target margin ranges, while generating free cash flow. As a result, AMEH is relatively well capitalized, particular when compared to peers such as CANO or OSH (though OSH is in the process of being acquired by CVS), which adds confidence.

In aggregate, we see very little risk to AMEH's liquidity position, and while expansion into new markets may strain the balance sheet to some extent, there is ample cash and debt capacity (currently negative net debt) to fund the growth.

### Risk points

### Difficult to export model, DMG cautionary tale...

In our view, the clearest risk to the AMEH story is in underwriting the company's ability to export the model beyond its core market of southern California. While the company has been able to operate at mature EBITDA margins successfully for what appears to be decades, according to a recent disclosure, essentially all (97%+) of value based membership still sits in southern California. Therefore, the company has essentially not yet proven it can enter new geographies, scale them to a reasonable size, and repeat the success they've had.

### DaVita Medical Group a cautionary tale...

The concept of a physician capitation focused primary care model is not new. But it is also not easy, if it was, then every provider would be doing it. The very fact that this model is differentiated, is exhibit A in how difficult it is to scale. It requires buy-in from individual physicians, and a change of mindset from the way many doctors have practiced medicine in the past (the FFS model). This is easier said than done and large companies have tried and failed to replicate this kind of model in the past, most recently in the case of Health Care Partners, which was sold to DVA (rebranded to DaVita Medical Group or DMG).

In DVA's defense, there were also significant MA rate cuts during this time to both the core rate and the coding component that disproportionately hit the company and caused some of the margin compression. But the example is still a lesson worth remembering as a sophisticated company, with significantly more FCF and a stronger balance sheet than AMEH, was unable to expand the model, despite being successful in its core 3 markets.

### $5-$15m investment into care model for new market 'hubs'

When giving 2023 guidance, the company isolated a $5-$15m investment (operating losses) being used to 'more rapidly develop growth' in Nevada and northern California as a headwind to EBITDA. AMEH has flagged that its strategy in entering new markets is somewhat different from how it grows in southern California. Essentially the company believes it needs to acquire some existing provider groups (which it has done) and invest into their care models (which is dilutive) in order to create a 'hub' in the new market to begin contracting with MCOs. From there, the company plans to continue doing M&A, but also begin to contract with affiliates in those geographies, which can then send any high complexity patients back to the 'hubs', or at least leverage the additional resources AMEH invested in.

In total, for 2023 it appears AMEH is reinvesting 3-8% of its EBITDA into growing in external markets, and in our conversations it sounds like they expect to achieve 'double digit' return on investment (similar to what CVS expects to generate from OSH). While

# BofA GLOBAL RESEARCH

we do believe these types of returns justify the reinvestment, the exportability of the model still remains unproven, and therefore the returns are difficult to underwrite.

### Accounting structure is complicated, related parties

An important nuance to understanding AMEH is that its GAAP accounting does not entirely reflect its underlying economics. The company currently does not offer an adjusted revenue figure, but in this report and in our model we attempt to break out the underlying spending under management which drives the economics more so than what accounting disclosures would imply. This additional work is helpful for investors to understand the full embedded opportunity, however this is more nuanced vs some of AMEH's peers which have a more simplified business mix and accounting reporting structure. For example, at Oak Street (OSH), GAAP revenue fully reflects spending under management, and clearly breaks down the components of COGS, whereas that is not the case at AMEH. While the accounting has no actual impact on the business, it adds another layer of complexity for investors in a sector which is already esoteric on its own.

### Value based care revenue only partially reflects underlying economics

In the state of California, risk bearing entities including provider groups must obtain a special 'Knox-Keene' license in order to be eligible to assume the full financial risk of a patient. Therefore, the company is limited to partial risk arrangements with insurance companies, whereby AMEH generally assumes upside/downside risk on 35% of spending (out of a typical 85% capitation rate) in what is known as the primary care cap. Since the company's model is around whole patient care, not being able to share in the upside on the remaining 50% (85% - 35%) of spending would be leaving money on the table (since those savings would be getting generated regardless). As a workaround, AMEH finds a hospital partner in each market to contract separately with the insurance company to assume the remaining 50% of the risk (known as institutional risk). That hospital then enters into a separate arrangement with AMEH whereby AMEH would essentially assume the risk from the hospital but allow the hospital to participate partially in the upside when savings are generated in exchange for coordinating the contract with the MCO.

Due to this complex arrangement, even though the company essentially has the same economics as full risk, it can only report 35% of the premium (which is capitated at around 85%, implying AMEH is reporting around 41% of its actual spending under management) as revenue under the accounting rules, which is $930m for 2022. If we exclude the company's Direct Contracting / ACO REACH business which is technically not an insurance product, but reported in Capitation revenue, we would subtract an estimated $268m of spending under management for the company's ACO product. Since the remaining $662m is only 41% of spending, if we divide $662m by 41%, it implies actual spending under management outside ACO programs is $1.6b, meaning roughly $946m of revenue is reported 'off balance sheet' at the hospital partner.

### The way this gets reported, is that instead of booking the spending being managed as revenue and paying out medical cost as COGS, AMEH only books the net economics (its share of the savings) within risk pool settlements and incentives, which AMEH reported

# BofA GLOBAL RESEARCH

as $117m in 2022. Within that, AMEH received a settlement of $49m related to the NextGen ACO program in 2021 (on a 1YR lag). Therefore, we estimate the remaining $68m is related to these private capitation hospital 'workaround' arrangements. Essentially that $68m reflects AMEH's net savings (medical spending under management – actual incurred medical costs - hospital share of economics) from the $945m in 'off balance sheet' spending under management, implying a 7% net margin which flows through AMEH's P&L as earnings without any COGS.

### Similarly, the MSO understates the actual spending being managed

As discussed earlier in this report, AMEH offers an MSO product which essentially gives external physician groups access to AMEH's technology and infrastructure services in exchange for a fixed percentage fee of practice revenue generated. In 2022, AMEH reported roughly $41m of revenue for this business line. However, this severely understates the actual amount of spending being managed. On average, AMEH is charging customers a fixed 10% of practice collections (revenue being managed at the physician group), and therefore the spending under management can be deduced by taking reported revenue divided by 10%.

| MSO Customer Capitation Rate  | 41%         |
| MSO Premiums under management | $997,997    |

### There is an additional nuance because AMEH's customers are value based care providers in California, which again, requires a Knox-Keene license to assume full-risk on a member. Since AMEH's customers don't have this license, the revenue they report is only a fraction of THEIR spending under management (generally about 35% of the 85% capitation rate or 41% of spending managed). Therefore, to truly back into the spending under management we divide AMEH's management fee income by 10% and an additional 41%, implying in 2022 the company was managing around $1b of value based spending through its MSO offering.

### Fully adjusted revenue could be >3x higher than GAAP, some to get recaptured

Ultimately due to these accounting complexities, the actual spending being managed is materially higher than what AMEH currently reports in is GAAP accounting, such that the 'adjusted revenue' which would be more comparable to how many peer companies such as OSH report, is 2x+ higher than AMEH's GAAP revenue. We note that at the end of 2022, AMEH acquired a Knox-Keene license, and is in the process of converting its contracts with MCOs towards full risk, though the company believes it will take between 18-36 months to fully play out. Therefore, over the next few years the company would

# BofA GLOBAL RESEARCH

slowly convert the unreported capitation premiums (purple bars in the chart below) into GAAP capitation revenue. For the most part, this would have almost no impact on EBITDA, though there may be a slight lift as the hospital group would no longer be taking its share.

### Long history of acquisitions, possible integration risks

Its worth taking the time to review the corporate history of AMEH. As mentioned above, the company dates back to the early 1990's when Allied Pacific of California, or APC (the largest affiliate and now shareholder of AMEH) and Network Medical Management or NMM (the early MSO and technology predecessor to AMEH) were founded. Since then, APC and NMM have entered into a deep partnership (consolidating financials) and completed a reverse merger in 2017 with AMEH going public. Along the way, the company has expanded business lines into ACO products as well as completed a number of other smaller acquisitions.

We note that this somewhat complex history of transactions highlights the company's history of growing in large part inorganically. So far, it appears transactions have been integrated successfully, but the risk of relying on deals to grow, lowers visibility into future growth (since it relies on sourcing deals rather than opening a clinic), the potential to overpay for assets (though AMEH remained disciplined during 2021 when valuations were frothy), and the risk of integration issues such as provider and patient churn.

### Company Sector
Physician Practice Management

### Company Description
Apollo Medical (AMEH) is a physician enablement company that aims to streamline administrative functions for providers, and maximize practice economics by shifting the focus to value based care. What makes AMEH unique is its ability to work across all payers (vs peers who largely focus on Medicare products). Additionally, the company has a uniquely long track record (25+ years), and has proven its unit economics by generating target margins on a consolidated basis.

### Investment Rationale
Having proven the model in Southern California, AMEH is already generating ample free cash today, with enough local scale to have built a defensible moat around the core earnings base. Meanwhile, it is only now beginning to export the model into new geographies, which bears significant execution risk, but requires minimal capital investment. Therefore, we see limited downside, with potential for upside if it can replicate results in new markets, although visibility is constrained.

### Company overview

Apollo Medical (AMEH) is a physician enablement company that aims to streamline administrative functions for providers and maximize practice economics by shifting the focus to value based care. What makes AMEH unique is its ability to work across all payers (vs peers who largely focus on Medicare products), having already found traction in Medicaid, Commercial, ACO REACH and Medicare Advantage. Additionally, the company has a uniquely long track record (25+ years), and has proven its unit economics by generating target margins on a consolidated basis.

AMEH uses its technology and employed care teams to identify gaps in care, better document health status, identify high value external specialists, and financially encourage intervention where appropriate to improve outcomes and lower costs. The company also contracts with MCOs in a way that allow AMEH and the provider group to share in the upside created by these cost savings. By partnering with existing physician practices, which are already profitable, AMEH is able to grow while generating cash, with minimal capex or startup costs.

### MSO / Technology overview

AMEH's corporate history dates back 1994, when the company was founded under the name 'Network Medical Management' or NMM which was purely an MSO. According to AMEH's website, Management services organizations (MSOs) 'provide management, administrative and other non-medical support services to medical companies and IPAs (independent physician associations)'. Some of these services include, but are not limited to billing, collections and human resources which we outline in more detail below.

### Managing all administrative functions of a practice

At a high level, the MSO promises to streamline all of the administrative functions a provider group would normally need to manage, while allowing the doctors who own the practice to focus on providing the best care to patients.

### Services include outsourced back-office functions, marketing

These services include back-office functions like customer service, managing the IT department and various technology vendors, building a website and managing patient records in a HIPPA compliant way, helping doctors negotiate rates with insurance companies, resolving claims disputes with members, and ensuring regulatory compliance such as proper credentialling. Additionally, the MSO helps recruit and manage staff, while actively marketing to find new patients.

### Additional services include broad based care management

Aside from purely administrative functions, the MSO also helps doctors with medical care management by employing case managers to help route patients to needed resources (such as food stamps or other social benefits), creating, and adhering to quality metrics, connecting patients to owned provider assets (AMEH owns some surgery centers, labs, urgent care clinics), and route patients to lower cost/higher value care settings.

### Contracts can last 3-30 years, earn 25-30% margins

Through the MSO, AMEH enters into arrangements to provide these services to provider groups under 'master service agreements', which are typically written with 3-30 years terms, which are ‘generally not terminable by our affiliated IPAs and medical groups except in the case of bankruptcy, fraud, or other illegal acts by the contracting MSO'. Through the agreement, AMEH gains exclusive authority over non-medical decisions related to business operations. Rather than charging a fixed fee for these services, AMEH generally collects a 'take rate' which ranges from 8-12% of the provider groups' total revenue/cash collections. AMEH records this revenue as 'management fee income'. For these services, AMEH generally earns a 25-30% EBITDA margin.

It's worth pointing out AMEH's closest public peer, Privia Health (PRVA), has a similar business line which earns management fees on practice collections. However, PRVA's customers are generally still operating under fee-for-service in those arrangements while AMEH's customers are generally already in value based care.

### Over time, MSO business has become smaller contributor

Despite the company being founded around the MSO business, it only represents ~11% of revenues today and just 8% of EBITDA (when assuming target margin on reported revenue), down from 8% of revenue and 23% of EBITDA in 2016. This is due to the company shifting its focus towards value based care offerings while ramping the earnings on those arrangements.

### Value-based 'IPA' Overview

In 1999, NMM entered into a 30 year MSO agreement with a large physician network named 'Allied Pacific of California' or APC. Due to the tight integration of NMM and APC, accounting rules required that NMM report APC as a consolidated subsidiary (with all of APC's financials flowing through NMM's consolidated reporting). Through this deep partnership, eventually AMEH began to shift its focus towards value based care, which AMEH refers to as its 'consolidated IPAs'.

### IPA shifts economics from revenue cycle to insurance

Rather than accepting a fixed percentage share of overall provider practice revenue under the MSO model, the IPA or value based model instead takes over the risk and responsibility of medical costs (which it reports as revenue) from the insurance companies representing the patients, and earns a profit by keeping medical costs below the insurer's own spending benchmark. In effect, AMEH shifts the economic model from that of a revenue cycle management company towards that of a health insurer.

### Affiliate model helps external provider groups take risk

In most cases, AMEH enters into IPA (and MSO) arrangements with external, non-owned provider groups, also known colloquially as 'affiliates'. Essentially, AMEH provides these affiliate groups with all of the same technology and infrastructure built into the MSO offering outlined in the section above, as well as greater focus on medical management tools/clinical staff and access to value based contracts with insurance companies. Importantly, AMEH backstops all of the downside risk (of medical costs going above the benchmark) for the provider group.

AMEH, in partnership with the affiliate then assumes the underwriting risk (medical costs) of the patient and becomes responsible for managing down third party medical expenses. Notably, since in most cases AMEH does not own the affiliate, it is not responsible for any of the costs of running the clinics. Instead, the affiliate divides the gross profit or Medical Margin (Premiums - Third Party Medical Expenses) in half with the provider group. After applying a modest amount of corporate overhead AMEH is left with ~15% EBITDA margins.

### However, affiliates harder to manage and align incentives

At first glance it would seem the affiliate model is better than building clinics as some major peers have done. The ability to earn similar margins without any capital expenditures or the cost of ramping capacity should result in a higher return on invested capital. And that can be true. In fact, this was the strategy many major MCOs have been using for most of the last decade in order to help drive volumes into value based care. However, finding willing and able partners in the right markets is more difficult than it sounds. Most geographies don't have providers with experience taking capitated risk. Even if you do find the right groups, they may not be entirely focused on Medicare Advantage, and would have more difficulty managing MLR, stars and risk scores. Finally, if a group is successful they may eventually push back on its contractual revenue share to lower its share of the profits or seek a different enablement partner.

### Allows physicians to retain ownership, M&A pipeline

Regardless of the puts and takes between ownership and affiliate models, both are finding a product market fit today, and AMEH engages in both models (though primarily focused on affiliates). This way, the company can buy practices or work with doctors don't want to work for a corporate enterprise and would rather maintain their existing ownership structure while working with a sophisticated external partner to take risk. For AMEH and other companies doing both (eg (competitors such as UNH/HUM/CANO/BHG), the affiliate market creates an M&A pipeline by introducing them to physicians groups and seeing how well they can manage risk.

### Doctors usually bring full patient panels, relationships

Unlike the clinic model, which requires staffing the center and finding new patients, the affiliate model generally onboards physicians who already have existing patient panels. This reduces the cost of acquiring revenue (AGL talks about 13:1 LTV to CAC) as a percentage, as well as avoids financial dilution of running a clinic with unfilled capacity. Therefore, by partnering with existing groups, an affiliate can build a network of physicians to rapidly achieve scale in a local market. As an added benefit, this brings built-in trust from existing relationships between the patient and provider, which can improve outcomes on an absolute basis.

### Providers can earn more doing less

Thus far, we have generally talked about the financial benefits from the perspective of AMEH. However, working with AMEH makes economic sense for these affiliate provider groups, some of which have been in business for decades, but have not been able to make value based care work. In our view, the value proposition from AMEH is straightforward, more money for less work. By shifting the practice to value based care, the practice can generate 13x revenue, and 2-3x earnings in the example below, even after reducing the patient panel size by 33%.

Of course, the crux of the model relies on being able to manage down medical costs to an economically sustainable level, which in this case we assume 70% for most payers (worse than what AMEH has been able to generate historically) and 85% for Original Medicare (it is more difficult to generate savings in programs such as ACO REACH and Medicare Shared Savings). In part, these savings are generated from AMEH's incremental services and consulting. However, another important element of the model is financially incentivizing doctors to spend more time with patients (reducing overall panel sizes) and less time on administrative work (outsourced to AMEH).

### AMEH needs to manage costs better than MCOs

Underpinning the economic model of these value based arrangements is the fact that with the right incentive, physician groups can manage down healthcare costs more efficiently than an MCO. AMEH invests significantly more into its care platform than the average fee for service physician, utilizing a proprietary IT platform, care teams, smaller patient panels (less G&A leverage), and back-office staff to coordinate and close gaps in care for the patient. According to AMEH they have been able to lower hospital admissions and ER visits 66%/77% more effectively than the FFS benchmark on their Medicare Advantage patients, which is critical to lowering costs as hospital spending is the largest bucket of overall healthcare spend, representing 44% of the average Medicare patient's expenditures.

### The higher the risk the higher the reward

Unlike in fee-for-service, value based care reimbursement is largely unrelated to how much market share a physician has in a market or even the fee-schedule itself. The more relevant driver of revenue is the amount of medical spending under management to drive shared savings off of, as well as the amount of risk the provider is taking.
Below we illustrate our estimate for what a typical provider should expect to generate in FFS revenues (before salary or clinic expenses) for each patient on an annual basis. We

# BofA GLOBAL RESEARCH

then compare the amount of medical margin (patient medical spending benchmark - actual medical spending-insurer portion – enablement company portion) a provider could generate if that provider switched to value based care and managed to an 85% MLR (medical margin is comparable to FFS revenue in this way because it represents the cash the provider can spend to pay salaries and clinic expenses).

Interestingly, when looking at things this way, it is clear why most value based models have focused on the high acuity population, because the FFS revenues conceivably may not be far off from what could be achieved in value based care, which exposes the provider to the risk of earning less. Instead, value based models work best when targeting the highest spending cohorts, from which to drive savings off of.

### Full-risk MA is most profitable, but not all groups can focus on it exclusively

Based on this, it is clear to us that running a physician practice exclusively focused on full capitation for the Medicare population is undoubtedly more profitable than a mixed patient panel or FFS patient base. However, AMEH is betting on the fact that not all provider groups are able to or willing to have such a narrow strategy, and instead AMEH aims to maximize the economics of a model that treats all types of patients.

### AMEH sees delegated claims as differentiator

Despite taking full risk for spending, most capitated providers are not actually responsible for paying out claims (the MCO does that and then periodically trues up payments to the doctor group to reflect the savings vs the benchmark that they generate). The downside of doing it this way is that the physician groups have limited visibility into how claims are developing in real time. However, some capitated providers (particularly in mature markets like California such as AMEH) actually are responsible for directly paying claims in what's called a 'delegateď model. AMEH believes that the delegated model can be a differentiator in expanding its integrated model into less mature markets.

### Increases payment speed, visibility into claims, ‘one check' for doctors

Under the delegated model, the capitated provider can take on responsibility for more Managed Care functions beyond just economic responsibility of medical claims. For one, delegated providers end up receiving premiums and paying out claims on a cash basis, which significantly increases the speed of the payment cycle and the visibility the capitated provider has into real time medical spending of a member.

Importantly, this allows AMEH to function as a flow through entity for all of a provider group's billings, allowing the provider to submit claims and receive reimbursement from a single entity rather than potentially dozens of different insurance companies on different schedules with different reconciliation processes.

# BofA GLOBAL RESEARCH

### Ability to approve prior authorization in real time, improve access

Additionally, by taking delegated claims the provider can also become responsible for prior authorization and claims adjudication. This is helpful because for example, if a patient wants to get an MRI they often need explicit authorization from the insurance company. By taking on prior authorization, the provider can almost instantly approve prior authorization requests (vs potentially days to hear back from the insurance company) and more quickly perform healthcare services during the same visit or immediately send someone to a specialist on the same day to increase compliance.

### Exerts more control and flexibility over external network

Finally, the last major advantage of taking delegated claims is that the provider can help refine the network of external providers (including rate negotiation, removing providers from network, utilization management, provider credentialing, care navigation, setting quality targets) who can now send claims directly to the delegated provider instead of having to deal with the policies of multiple separate insurance companies. If the delegated provider has specific referral sources it uses for its patient base, it can negotiate even lower rates vs the original MCO network, and encourage greater in-network steerage among its patient base.

### Go deeper: See our 140 page value based care primer

In the sections above we briefly touch on the key concepts behind AMEH's core business model, value based care. However, the industry itself is relatively esoteric and we believe requires a significant amount of context to fully understand, which we outline in much greater detail in our [140 page value based care primer, linked here](https://www.bofaml.com/content/dam/bofa/global-research/en/pdf/VBC_Primer.pdf).

In the report we cover the history of the fee-for-service (FFS) system, why value based care (VBC) could work this time, size the opportunity and growth, explain the nuances of reimbursement (including risk adjustment) and why Medicare works best, bridge how companies lower MLR and reach target margin, detail cash flow mechanics, provide an overview of key companies in the sector, examine transactions and public valuations, discuss possible points of strategic differentiation, as well as explain insurance accounting.

### Additionally, we address the most commonly asked questions from investors

Why have most companies focused on Medicare Advantage? Why not Commercial or Medicaid? How exactly do these companies save money? How can they earn a margin on 85% of premium? Why would a Managed Care plan work with them? Why not start their own MCO? Which model is better, owned versus affiliate? Aren't they just gaming risk codes? How differentiated is the technology? How much regulatory risk is there? What if regulators look to cap profits? What long term competitive advantages / economic moats are there? At what point do we shift from "everyone wins on industry growth" to "these companies start taking share from each other"? Why are the stocks so volatile?

### Management overview

Below we provide a brief overview of AMEH's current management team. One governance item which is worth pointing out is that the current co-CEO, Brandon Sim, is the son of Dr. Kenneth Sim, the long-standing Executive Chairman of the board since 2013. The chairman and other co-CEO Thomas Lam have a history as practicing physicians and have been involved in AMEH and the predecessor organizations for a decade or more. Meanwhile, the newer co-CEO Brandon Sim, was previously the COO, CTO and VP of engineering. Before that, Brandon worked as a quant analyst on Wall Street, and as a co-founder of a healthcare technology company. Finally, the current interim CFO Chan Basho has more ‘traditional' industry experience having worked at other large healthcare services organizations such as ALHC and Healthcare Partners, which was acquired by DVA, and ultimately re-sold to UNH.

### Investment Positives

### Positioned within the highest growth HC services sector

In our view, the most obvious and sizable tailwind for AMEH is that the industry it focuses on, value based care, has a large and fast growing total addressable market. We estimate that in aggregate, the highest form of risk arrangements, full-capitation, represented just 11% of healthcare spending in 2022 which we could see ramping to 34% in 2030. In absolute dollar terms this would shift $420b worth of capitation payments to $1.9T, growing at a 21% CAGR.

### 'Field of dreams' model, if they build it, MCOs will come

In our view, the value based care model aligns the incentives between the provider and the MCO, which ultimately drives more volume into these models over time. Patients have little insight into the cost/benefit of health care services and managed care companies are one step removed from the patient's bed side. As a result, incentivizing doctors, who have the best understanding of the patient's needs, to think about the most cost-effective services while also incentivizing quality has significant potential to reduce costs and improve outcomes, in our view. Below we outline the key incentive alignments between the provider and the insurer under value based care.

1)  **Maximize Gross Profit** By law, MCOs have to spend 85% of premiums on medical costs (if costs fall below, the rebate the difference to the customer). By capitating risk to a provider an MCO is able to maximize its own gross profit by paying the doctor 85% of premiums, which shifting risk of cost spikes to the provider.

# BofA GLOBAL RESEARCH

2)  **Incentivize better coding** Now that the provider is getting paid as a % of premiums, the doctor has more incentive to document health status and risk code as higher risk adjusted payments from CMS get splits 15% to the MCO and 85% to the provider.
3)  **Rewards higher quality scores** High quality Medicare Advantage plans get paid a 5% bonus, and since the provider is getting paid a % of premiums, they are now incentivized to achieve higher quality scores.
4)  **Improves plan retention** Finally, if a patient is truly engaged by a key provider (such as a PCP) that patient is less likely to switch health insurers and risk losing their network, increasing retention.

### HUM highlights value of shifting to risk, MCOs demanding it

At their investor day in 2021 HUM helped quantify the impact on three of these four critical outcomes. In full risk arrangements (Owned, JV and Alliance) HUM saw 20% higher underwriting profit, 33% higher quality (stars) scores, 24% higher Net Promoter Scores (NPS) and -20% reduction in avoidable hospital admissions which each drive higher member retention. Essentially, by capitating away premiums an MCO such as HUM maximizes financial outcomes while almost entirely offloading risk. Therefore, MCOs are aggressively seeking to partner with providers who are able to accept full capitation arrangements, driving higher penetration in the sector.

### Economics relatively ‘proven' on a consolidated basis

One of the clearest points of differentiation AMEH has from its peers is that it has a relatively long history of delivering against its growth and margin targets on a consolidated basis. Many of the public peers (such as AGL, CANO and OSH) on the other hand, have been funding aggressive growth dilutively and therefore are not near their target profitability. Instead, those companies show investors cohort analysis performance, highlighting that early cohorts are performing well, with the hope that newer business will ramp at the same pace over time, such that eventually when enough of the business is matured, the consolidated financials should mirror those cohort numbers. While that thesis is valid, it is difficult for outside investors to fully trust these disclosures (could be cherry picked, manipulated, or simply not representative of future results).

Since AMEH had historically been contained to its core market of southern California, and had reached a mature scale in that market, the consolidated financials already show strong results, adding some visibility. Below we show some highlights of AMEH's key performance indicators. Notably the company has grown both revenue and EBITDA at a 25% CAGR vs 2016, while maintaining EBITDA margins within its 10-20% long term guidance range and a third party MLR ratio of 70% or lower.

### Consolidated results significantly better than peers

As mentioned above, these results are in contrast to those reported by many of the public peers. Below we highlight AMEH's consolidated MLR, COGS ratio and Adj. EBITDA margins over time vs some of these peers. Looking at things this way, AMEH has clearly 'outperformed' on these metrics. Though we note that it is heavily influenced by the fact that AMEH has chosen to contain growth to its mature markets. All of these peer companies talk about generating similar results on early cohorts, so to the extent those can be replicated, eventually the gap in these metrics should close. However, reporting these strong results on a consolidated basis within audited financials does add some additional visibility.

### NextGen ACO results add further confidence in effectiveness of model

One other proof point in the model we'd highlight are results from AMEH's participation in CMS's NextGen ACO program, which ran from 2016-2021, though AMEH joined in 2017. This program allowed doctors (enabled by AMEH) to take financial risk on Original Medicare patients (coverage through the federal government). For every year of participation except 2018, AMEH outperformed the program-wide savings rate, in many cases by a wide margin. Since this data is released by the federal government, is tested over time, and is tied to a program with relatively strict guardrails on company profits, we believe they add additional credibility to AMEH's ability to bend the cost curve. We note however, that membership was limited to 20-30k members vs the base of AMEH's 1m+ total, but given these are higher cost seniors, represented 14-20% of AMEH's spending under management during that time.

### NextGen ACO transitioned to ACO Reach in 14 states

Its worth mentioning that the NextGen ACO program ended in 2021, and as of 2022 AMEH had transitioned many of those same beneficiaries to the Direct Contracting (rebranded ACO REACH in 2023). As a result, the company is able to report all of the spending under management as revenue (due to different accounting rules) though the economic model is largely similar. Additionally, its worth flagging that both NextGen ACO and ACO REACH manages patients in 14 different states, despite AMEH's core focus being California. The company views ACO REACH as a good standalone business but also sees strategic value in building relationships with physicians before entering a market in a bigger way (which is the playbook it used in Texas).

### Model is working across a broad mix of patients

AMEH has a relatively unique mix of value based care base of membership. While most peers focus almost exclusively on Medicare patients, AMEH has a very heavy skew towards Medicaid. While the company does not break down its membership or spending under management by payer, we use its GAAP revenue mix disclosure (which is not fully comparable) and our own estimates to back into it.

### In total, we estimate nearly 65% of value based membership is related to Medicaid, while the remaining 35% is split roughly evenly between Medicare and Commercial. In 2021 AMEH did help quantify its membership mix saying roughly 3/4 of the members were in Medicaid, while 1/8 were in Commercial / Medicare respectively, which roughly aligns with our analysis. Taking it a step further, we backed into actual spending under management, of which we estimate just 27% is actually tied to Medicaid (since the members are younger and have low reimbursement) whereas 56% is related to Medicare and 17% is commercial.

### AMEH's payer mix more diversified than all of its public peers

Below we show how AMEH's value based membership and spending under management compares against the public peers, which highlights the unique nature of AMEH's diverse mix of business.

### Other companies focus on MA for a reason, but AMEH makes diversity work

Importantly, there is a reason many of the public peers focus on Medicare Advantage, which we outline in this chart below (and [walk through in more detail in our primer, see report](https://www.bofaml.com/content/dam/bofa/global-research/en/pdf/VBC_Primer.pdf)). In our conversation with the company it sounds like Medicaid margins are only slightly profitable for them, while commercial is higher, and Medicare by far being the highest. Despite the large exposure to 'suboptimal' business lines such as Medicaid and Commercial, AMEH has consistently been able to earn a 10-20% EBITDA margin on a consolidated basis, adding further credibility to the success they've had on managing margins across a diverse base of members.

### Sees ability to work across payers as a strategic advantage

AMEH acknowledges that different payers have different nuances and margin profiles. However, it believes that working across every major program is a strategic differentiator for a number of reasons.

1)  **Comprehensive solution to providers** Many provider groups would prefer to work with an enablement company that will allow them to shift its entire patient panel from fee-for-service to value based care, allowing the physician to practice the same way with every patient.
2)  **Increases TAM** This increases AMEH's TAM from just Medicare (we estimate $1.2T in spending by 2030) to nearly $2T by including Commercial and Medicaid.
3)  **Heightened focus could improve outcomes** AMEH believes that by allowing the physician to practice the same way for every patient, it should make them more effective at improving outcomes and savings money, rather than juggling different care philosophies.

# BofA GLOBAL RESEARCH

4)  **Negotiating leverage with MCOs** Finally, the company believes that working across payer types helps secure stronger network access and reimbursement rates from insurance companies, which each generally have membership across multiple programs, and would prefer to work with provider groups that can offer more comprehensive value based solutions.

### FCF positive, well capitalized with ample liquidity

The relatively recent phenomena of high interest rates raises the costs of external financing for all companies, but particularly those in higher growth industries subject to more risks. Therefore, in that backdrop, the value of internal financing, i.e. having a strong balance sheet with ample liquidity, is heightened. As discussed in the sections above, AMEH's focus on its core market of southern California has allowed the company to operate within target margin ranges, while generating free cash flow. As a result, AMEH is relatively well capitalized, particular when compared to peers such as CANO or OSH (though OSH is in the process of being acquired by CVS), which adds confidence.

In aggregate, we see very little risk to AMEH's liquidity position, and while expansion into new markets may strain the balance sheet to some extent, there is ample cash and debt capacity (currently negative net debt) to fund the growth.

### Risk points

### Difficult to export model, DMG cautionary tale...

In our view, the clearest risk to the AMEH story is in underwriting the company's ability to export the model beyond its core market of southern California. While the company has been able to operate at mature EBITDA margins successfully for what appears to be decades, according to a recent disclosure, essentially all (97%+) of value based membership still sits in southern California. Therefore, the company has essentially not yet proven it can enter new geographies, scale them to a reasonable size, and repeat the success they've had.

### DaVita Medical Group a cautionary tale...

The concept of a physician capitation focused primary care model is not new. But it is also not easy, if it was, then every provider would be doing it. The very fact that this model is differentiated, is exhibit A in how difficult it is to scale. It requires buy-in from individual physicians, and a change of mindset from the way many doctors have practiced medicine in the past (the FFS model). This is easier said than done and large companies have tried and failed to replicate this kind of model in the past, most recently in the case of Health Care Partners, which was sold to DVA (rebranded to DaVita Medical Group or DMG).

In DVA's defense, there were also significant MA rate cuts during this time to both the core rate and the coding component that disproportionately hit the company and caused some of the margin compression. But the example is still a lesson worth remembering as a sophisticated company, with significantly more FCF and a stronger balance sheet than AMEH, was unable to expand the model, despite being successful in its core 3 markets.

### $5-$15m investment into care model for new market 'hubs'

When giving 2023 guidance, the company isolated a $5-$15m investment (operating losses) being used to 'more rapidly develop growth' in Nevada and northern California as a headwind to EBITDA. AMEH has flagged that its strategy in entering new markets is somewhat different from how it grows in southern California. Essentially the company believes it needs to acquire some existing provider groups (which it has done) and invest into their care models (which is dilutive) in order to create a 'hub' in the new market to begin contracting with MCOs. From there, the company plans to continue doing M&A, but also begin to contract with affiliates in those geographies, which can then send any high complexity patients back to the 'hubs', or at least leverage the additional resources AMEH invested in.

In total, for 2023 it appears AMEH is reinvesting 3-8% of its EBITDA into growing in external markets, and in our conversations it sounds like they expect to achieve 'double digit' return on investment (similar to what CVS expects to generate from OSH). While

# BofA GLOBAL RESEARCH

we do believe these types of returns justify the reinvestment, the exportability of the model still remains unproven, and therefore the returns are difficult to underwrite.

### Accounting structure is complicated, related parties

An important nuance to understanding AMEH is that its GAAP accounting does not entirely reflect its underlying economics. The company currently does not offer an adjusted revenue figure, but in this report and in our model we attempt to break out the underlying spending under management which drives the economics more so than what accounting disclosures would imply. This additional work is helpful for investors to understand the full embedded opportunity, however this is more nuanced vs some of AMEH's peers which have a more simplified business mix and accounting reporting structure. For example, at Oak Street (OSH), GAAP revenue fully reflects spending under management, and clearly breaks down the components of COGS, whereas that is not the case at AMEH. While the accounting has no actual impact on the business, it adds another layer of complexity for investors in a sector which is already esoteric on its own.

### Value based care revenue only partially reflects underlying economics

In the state of California, risk bearing entities including provider groups must obtain a special 'Knox-Keene' license in order to be eligible to assume the full financial risk of a patient. Therefore, the company is limited to partial risk arrangements with insurance companies, whereby AMEH generally assumes upside/downside risk on 35% of spending (out of a typical 85% capitation rate) in what is known as the primary care cap. Since the company's model is around whole patient care, not being able to share in the upside on the remaining 50% (85% - 35%) of spending would be leaving money on the table (since those savings would be getting generated regardless). As a workaround, AMEH finds a hospital partner in each market to contract separately with the insurance company to assume the remaining 50% of the risk (known as institutional risk). That hospital then enters into a separate arrangement with AMEH whereby AMEH would essentially assume the risk from the hospital but allow the hospital to participate partially in the upside when savings are generated in exchange for coordinating the contract with the MCO.

Due to this complex arrangement, even though the company essentially has the same economics as full risk, it can only report 35% of the premium (which is capitated at around 85%, implying AMEH is reporting around 41% of its actual spending under management) as revenue under the accounting rules, which is $930m for 2022. If we exclude the company's Direct Contracting / ACO REACH business which is technically not an insurance product, but reported in Capitation revenue, we would subtract an estimated $268m of spending under management for the company's ACO product. Since the remaining $662m is only 41% of spending, if we divide $662m by 41%, it implies actual spending under management outside ACO programs is $1.6b, meaning roughly $946m of revenue is reported 'off balance sheet' at the hospital partner.

### The way this gets reported, is that instead of booking the spending being managed as revenue and paying out medical cost as COGS, AMEH only books the net economics (its share of the savings) within risk pool settlements and incentives, which AMEH reported

# BofA GLOBAL RESEARCH

as $117m in 2022. Within that, AMEH received a settlement of $49m related to the NextGen ACO program in 2021 (on a 1YR lag). Therefore, we estimate the remaining $68m is related to these private capitation hospital 'workaround' arrangements. Essentially that $68m reflects AMEH's net savings (medical spending under management – actual incurred medical costs - hospital share of economics) from the $945m in 'off balance sheet' spending under management, implying a 7% net margin which flows through AMEH's P&L as earnings without any COGS.

### Similarly, the MSO understates the actual spending being managed

As discussed earlier in this report, AMEH offers an MSO product which essentially gives external physician groups access to AMEH's technology and infrastructure services in exchange for a fixed percentage fee of practice revenue generated. In 2022, AMEH reported roughly $41m of revenue for this business line. However, this severely understates the actual amount of spending being managed. On average, AMEH is charging customers a fixed 10% of practice collections (revenue being managed at the physician group), and therefore the spending under management can be deduced by taking reported revenue divided by 10%.

#### Exhibit 29: MSO revenue under GAAP only shows actual management fees paid to AMEH

| MSO Fee | 10% |
| MSO Customer Capitation Rate | 41% |
| MSO Premiums under management | $997,997 |

Source: BofA Global Research, Company Filings

### There is an additional nuance because AMEH's customers are value based care providers in California, which again, requires a Knox-Keene license to assume full-risk on a member. Since AMEH's customers don't have this license, the revenue they report is only a fraction of THEIR spending under management (generally about 35% of the 85% capitation rate or 41% of spending managed). Therefore, to truly back into the spending under management we divide AMEH's management fee income by 10% and an additional 41%, implying in 2022 the company was managing around $1b of value based spending through its MSO offering.

### Fully adjusted revenue could be >3x higher than GAAP, some to get recaptured

Ultimately due to these accounting complexities, the actual spending being managed is materially higher than what AMEH currently reports in is GAAP accounting, such that the 'adjusted revenue' which would be more comparable to how many peer companies such as OSH report, is 2x+ higher than AMEH's GAAP revenue. We note that at the end of 2022, AMEH acquired a Knox-Keene license, and is in the process of converting its contracts with MCOs towards full risk, though the company believes it will take between 18-36 months to fully play out. Therefore, over the next few years the company would

# BofA GLOBAL RESEARCH

slowly convert the unreported capitation premiums (purple bars in the chart below) into GAAP capitation revenue. For the most part, this would have almost no impact on EBITDA, though there may be a slight lift as the hospital group would no longer be taking its share.

### Long history of acquisitions, possible integration risks

Its worth taking the time to review the corporate history of AMEH. As mentioned above, the company dates back to the early 1990's when Allied Pacific of California, or APC (the largest affiliate and now shareholder of AMEH) and Network Medical Management or NMM (the early MSO and technology predecessor to AMEH) were founded. Since then, APC and NMM have entered into a deep partnership (consolidating financials) and completed a reverse merger in 2017 with AMEH going public. Along the way, the company has expanded business lines into ACO products as well as completed a number of other smaller acquisitions.

We note that this somewhat complex history of transactions highlights the company's history of growing in large part inorganically. So far, it appears transactions have been integrated successfully, but the risk of relying on deals to grow, lowers visibility into future growth (since it relies on sourcing deals rather than opening a clinic), the potential to overpay for assets (though AMEH remained disciplined during 2021 when valuations were frothy), and the risk of integration issues such as provider and patient churn.

### Largest customer is largest shareholder, excluded assets held on balance sheet

Another complexity worth exploring is AMEH's relationship with its largest customer, Allied Physicians of California (APC). APC is also its largest shareholder, with 18% of shares outstanding. Additionally, due to the deep integration and control stake, AMEH consolidates the P&L and balance sheet of APC beyond its actual economic impact. For example, APC holds real estate and equity assets on its balance sheet which create volatility in earnings for AMEH, even though the economics of those arrangements don't impact AMEH's cash flows, and the parent company is not responsible for the gains or losses. AMEH isolates these impacts as an adjustment to EBITDA called 'APC excluded assets' which were $32m and $11m in 2021 and 2022 respectively.

### Government pen stroke risk, reimbursement sensitivity

With much of the membership, revenue and earnings coming from government programs (Medicare and Medicaid), the risk of changes to those programs become increasingly important to monitor. One major area of concern relates to Medicare Advantage risk adjustment. Essentially, MA plans must submit documentation codes in order to get paid appropriately for the higher costs of treating sicker patients. Given the incentive to code more, MA plans have arguably been overpaid to some degree. MedPAC, an industry watchdog, estimates that MA plans are overpaid by about 9%, though 6% of the delta is already being adjusted for through what is called a statutory coding adjustment. Therefore, on this simplified view, MA plans are still overpaid by about 3% vs the original Medicare benchmark.

In recent months, regulators have been pushing to help close this gap through finalization of stricter audit rules (to prevent possible fraud (see report)), as well as adjustments to the risk model itself (to remove risk codes that are not as predictive of costs (see report)), as well as through proposed legislation in Congress (unlikely to pass) which all tackle the issue in different ways. Ultimately, while we do expect pressure over the medium term starting in 2024/2025 on risk adjustment practices, which have outsized impact on provider groups that AMEH works with vs the headline cut to MA plans, we see the overall impact as being manageable, with clear offsets. However, the true impacts are difficult to calculate until the regulatory changes get phased in (audits only begin in 2025, risk model being phased in from 2024-2027, legislation still in the air), meaning there is still some degree of uncertainty.

Finally, we note that AMEH's business today is largely in Southern California, a highly penetrated value based care market, meaning that exposure to these regulatory changes is relatively high. However, it also means health insurance benefits being offered are built on sustaining the current level of risk adjustment, and if there are meaningful changes, insurer benefit designs could get cut and largely offset the impact, which we discuss in more detail below. Essentially, what is important is not the absolute level of risk adjustment exposure, but the degree to which a specific provider's risk adjustment scores are an outlier within a specific market, which is less likely in California where most providers are 'good' at coding.

### Benefit designs a cushion against rate cuts, but can be a double edged sword

One thing that is not intuitive about capitated providers in Medicare Advantage (a major source of earnings for AMEH), is that net pricing includes both total revenue as well as benefit design. By this, we mean that a large part of the cost structure includes optional supplemental benefits, which now represent 13% of the benchmark. Without going into too much detail, if there are cuts to MA reimbursement, MCOs and thus capitated providers have a built in 'cushion' to absorb the impact by cutting supplemental benefits given to seniors as lower revenue is offset by lower costs.

# BofA GLOBAL RESEARCH

### However, in some ways this also represents another threat. Over time, MCOs have increased the supplemental benefits given to MA beneficiaries (funded through rebates generated by reducing costs below the benchmark spending) in order to attract and retain membership. However, this means that the percentage of total spending flowing into core medical expenses is declining (instead going into supplemental benefits like gym memberships which cannot be managed down). This implies MCOs are getting increasingly confident in their ability to manage down core medical costs, baking those savings into actuarial bids, and passing those savings to consumers to differentiate their offerings, which can threaten the capitated provider margins. In effect, capitated providers only get paid to manage costs that the MCO cannot manage on its own, and they must continually outperform that standard.

### Upcoming Medicaid enrollment cliff highlights further regulatory risk

States consistently review their Medicaid enrollment to redetermine if a member still qualifies for Medicaid or not (often a person gets a job and makes too much money to qualify for Medicaid coverage). At the beginning of the pandemic, the federal government gave states additional financial support, but required that any states that took the money would have to halt Medicaid redeterminations (all of them did). As result of these suspensions, Medicaid enrollment has swelled by over 20m from February 2020 to December 2022 which is a noticeable reversal from recent pre-COVID declines. Currently, redeterminations are expected to resume in early April.

It is still unclear how much of the Medicaid enrollment gained during COVID is related to individuals who are truly no longer eligible for coverage or are newly unemployed, or simply signed up for coverage they were already eligible for during the pandemic. Therefore, it is unclear what % of membership would eventually roll off. In total AMEH is assuming 5-15% of its total Medicaid enrollment is likely to roll off (vs 30% growth in overall Medicaid) which would be a headwind to 2023 and 2024 EBITDA.

### MLR is a bigger risk than revenue

Importantly, there is an elevated risk on MLR and margins in Medicaid, (see report), as when states are able to remove people from Medicaid who no longer qualify, that population is likely to be healthier than average (since they are able to work). Although states will likely adjust rates to reflect this, we would expect a lag which could drive MLR misses in 2023. Of note, ELV cited a 300bps MLR pressure in states were redeterminations happened in 2019, causing a 50bps consolidated MLR pressure that year. Redeterminations will likely happen at more than 2x the scale than they were in 2019 in half the time, setting the stage that even if states do raise rates proactively, they may not raise them enough.

### Modeling AMEH, valuation methods

Modeling AMEH is somewhat complicated, and we encourage investors to open our excel model for more details, which we project out to 2032. However, at a high level there are a number of key drivers to bear in mind. First, the key assumption to make is around the number of lives under management, both in full risk arrangements as well as the MSO (which have different margin implications).

For the MSO business, we assume membership grows around 5% (less of a focus), while spending under management grows 4% (similar to overall healthcare spending), translating into 9% revenue growth. We assume AMEH is able to maintain the same 27.5% margins going forward, meaning that revenue growth is equal to gross margin growth going forward.

The value-based care component of the business is more complicated to model and we detail much of the mechanics of the economics throughout this report. We model the growth primarily on a membership basis, assuming it grows slightly faster than 10% (AMEH has recently talked about mid-teens over the near term). Meanwhile, spending under management (which AMEH doesn't fully disclose but we back into in earlier sections) grows at 5%, slightly above overall healthcare growth due to a mix shift towards higher spending per member populations. Together this translates to a 17% revenue CAGR, which is roughly equal to what we see gross margins growing (assuming essentially flat but some mix shift to lower margin ACO REACH).

When combining the MSO and VBC adjusted revenue or spending under management, we see AGL growing at a 15% CAGR through 2032, while growing gross margins 16%. In our estimates we assume some modest G&A de-leveraging out of conservatism, which translates into 13% Adj. EBITDA growth or 16% FCF (leverage on capex as it is a low capital intensity business).

### EV/Revenue widely used, but not always comparable

Valuation multiples in general are difficult to use for companies growing revenue 20-100% + per year, as both the revenue and earnings denominators are rapidly changing, and a large part of the value of the company is based on financial performance far into the future (when companies are near their target margin vs losing money today).

EV/Revenue is still the most widely used valuation metric when looking at physician enablement companies, because it is easy to calculate, revenue is available across all competitors (many of which have no profitability metrics to put a multiple on) and is the most stable reported number for these companies. However, there are significant disadvantages to using revenue multiples.

First, target margins vary by the business model. For example, clinic model and affiliate model companies recognize the same revenue for the same patient, but a clinic operator should ultimately have higher margins, therefore a higher revenue multiple at maturity (though potentially lower multiple if the affiliate is closer to profitability today). Second, some affiliate companies account for revenue differently for certain programs, such as ACO reach or partial capitation arrangements. As a result, for companies that do not consolidate revenue for contracts where they take risk, one could gross up their revenue to reflect the spending under management to be comparable with another company that is all fully consolidated. However, this adjusted revenue number is non-GAAP and may not be easily available.

### Multiples have come down dramatically trading below ‘matured' HC companies

Despite the puts and takes, we still see EV/Revenue as a useful valuation metric to watch. Above, we show how each of the physician enablement companies we cover

# BofA GLOBAL RESEARCH

tracks on EV/Revenue over time. Of the physician enablement companies listed here, OSH was the first to go public and traded at 8x-12x FWD revenue multiples at its peak. CANO went public through SPAC and traded within a range of 3-4x, followed by AGL (4x-6x) and PRVA (4-6x GAAP but 1x-2x on an adjusted basis), compared with AMEH generally trading in the 1-3x range on a GAAP basis. However, in 2021 valuations started to compress due to higher COVID costs across the industry lowered visibility into the efficacy of the models, and the resulting cash drag caused some companies to either raise equity dilutively or slow growth, which alongside broader macro themes such as higher interest rates which increase discount rates on growth stocks ultimately soured investor appetite for HC services growth stocks.

Today, OSH trades at just 2.5x 2YR FWD revenue (around the multiple CVS is expecting to acquire the company for), while AGL (1.8x), PRVA (1.5x) and CANO (0.5x) are lower. This compares to AMEH trading at 1.4x. Interestingly, many of these names now trade in-line or below the FWD revenues valuations of more matured HC services companies such as UNH (1.4x) and OPCH (1.4x) despite much higher growth profiles.

### EV/EBITDA the best LT metric, but limited in near term

Ultimately, we see EV/EBITDA as the most appropriate valuation multiple for physician enablement companies. This is because EV/EBITDA is the most widely used metric to value mature HC provider assets, giving investors a reasonable set of comparable HC peers to benchmark valuation against, which would account for many of the same investment characteristics, such as growth, FCF, leverage and regulatory risks. Additionally, forward Adj. EBITDA estimates are the best available, most widely followed proxy for the free cash flow generation potential of a business.

### EV/EBITDA multiples vary based on confidence and maturity

Below we show EV/EBITDA since the start of 2022 for companies we cover which are expected to be EBITDA positive in 2024. Notably, companies like AGL (59x), and PRVA (31x) are trading at what we would consider to be 'elevated multiples due to subscale margins, which makes it difficult to draw valuation conclusions. Interestingly, matured HC services companies with much slower growth profiles such as UNH (13x) and OPCH (15x) are trading surprisingly in-line with where CANO (13x) and AMEH (13x) are today, due to the fact that both physician companies have lower visibility into the ability to export the models beyond their core markets (FL and CA).

### Strong organic growth justifies 15-20x EBITDA multiples on matured earnings

All that said, none of the physician enablement companies we cover are at mature margins or stabilized growth, and many of them don't generate any EBITDA at all. Therefore, the companies can't easily be valued on typical EBITDA multiples. However, over time, as the models mature, the market is going to eventually put a multiple on the

# BofA GLOBAL RESEARCH

earnings. While there is no public pure play capitated provider with steady state margins to compare to, we've seen a strong correlation between healthcare providers with strong organic growth and EBITDA multiples. Even if these physician enablement companies don't get to target margins for another 10 years we'd still expect them to see strong organic revenue growth. Therefore, at a minimum, once the businesses reach steady state growth we'd expected a multiple around 15-20x EBITDA to be appropriate (roughly where home health has traded prior to Medicare rate cuts).

Below we highlight the correlation between Average historical EBITDA multiples and organic revenue growth for the more matured HC services companies we cover.

### $44 PO supported by 10YR FWD DCF

Ultimately, we value AMEH using 17.5x EV/EBITDA on our 2024 estimate outlined above to arrive at our $44 PO (1.3x GAAP revenues), which we see as justified as it is just above where mature HC services companies such as OPCH/UNH trade despite >2-3x EBITDA growth profile, but offset by higher execution risk. But in order to sanity check our assumptions we use a 10YR DCF assuming a discount rate and exit multiple. For the DCF we use the free cash flow numbers from 2023-2031 outlined above, but back out interest expense and stock compensation, apply an 'Exit Multiple' EBITDA multiple of 13x on 2032 EBITDA and a discount rate of 11%. As seen in the chart below these assumptions support a 16x multiple, which we see as justified as in line to where mature HC services companies such as OPCH/UNH trade despite >2-3x EBITDA growth profile but offset by higher execution risk.

### Price objective basis & risk

### Apollo Medical (AMEH)

We value AMEH using 17.5x EV/EBITDA on our 2024 estimate to arrive at $44 (1.3x GAAP revenues), which we see as justified, given it is in with where mature HC services companies trade, as its >2-3x EBITDA growth profile is offset by higher execution risks.

This PO is also supported by a 10YR DCF assuming a discount rate and exit multiple. For the DCF we use the free cash flow numbers from 2023-2031 outlined above, but back out interest expense and stock compensation, apply an 'Exit Multiple' EBITDA multiple of 13.0x on 2032 EBITDA and a discount rate of 11%.

Upside risks are better than expected ramp of new markets and ACO REACH while downside risks are Medicaid redeterminations and regulatory changes.
