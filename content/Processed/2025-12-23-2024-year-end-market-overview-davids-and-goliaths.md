# 2024 year-end market overview: Davids and Goliaths

As we embark on the new year, we’re taking a moment to reflect on the trends and activity that shaped digital health and healthcare innovation in 2024. Venture funding for U.S. digital health startups totaled $10.1B across 497 deals this year, after logging $1.8B across 118 deals in Q4. 2024’s lower funding pot was influenced by investors’ focus on earlier-stage funding, as well as a pullback on later-stage check sizes.

While 2024 saw heightened earlier-stage investment activity, a handful of large, more established players dominated healthcare innovation headlines. Heavyweight investors drove sector dealmaking, with mega funds like Andreessen Horowitz and General Catalyst leading the charge in digital health by transaction count. Big Tech players commanded the foundation model front, and a few companies competed to be AI partners for the nation’s largest healthcare organizations. Funding concentrated into already popular value propositions and therapeutic areas, including nonclinical workflow, mental health, and obesity care.

These dual trends—early-stage startup activity amidst big moves by large healthcare players—have created a David and Goliath dynamic in the healthcare innovation landscape. We see a future where David and Goliath can coexist, and even thrive together, to drive impactful change in healthcare. Achieving this vision will require that all parties understand their roles and opportunities for symbiotic relationships in the market.

## 2024 market overview

Annual venture funding in digital health totaled $10.1B across 497 deals, reflecting a slight decrease from 2023’s total dollars and a nominal decline in number of deals.

![](https://rockhealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Funding-Report_Q4-2024_Blog-Post-Graphics-Deck.png)

While 2024 outperformed the $8.2B raised in 2019 (our [benchmark year](https://rockhealth.com/insights/2023-q1-digital-health-funding-investing-like-its-2019/) outside of the COVID-19 funding cycle) in absolute terms, adjusting for inflation changes the story. One U.S. dollar in 2024 was worth approximately $0.82 in 20191—meaning that 2024’s $10.1B in digital health funding approximates to only $8.3B in 2019 dollars, nearly identical to 2019’s actual amount of capital raised.

There are a few contributing factors to lower funding levels in 2024 compared to prior years. One was investor focus on earlier-stage dealmaking, continuing a [trend](https://rockhealth.com/insights/2023-year-end-digital-health-funding/) we saw in 2023. Sixty-three percent of 2024’s funding rounds were labeled2 (an uptick from 57% in 2023), and, of these labeled deals, 86% supported startups raising their Seed, Series A, and Series B rounds. Investors are betting on younger companies, some of which are free from the [valuation baggage](https://rockhealth.com/insights/2023-year-end-digital-health-funding/) of 2020-2022 fundraising.

Another contributing factor to 2024’s smaller pot: digital health companies that raised later-stage rounds in 2024 did so at smaller check sizes compared to previous years. Median deal size for Series C and D fundraises clocked in at $50M and $55M respectively—drops from 2023’s $62M and $58M, and big slashes from 2021 highs of $73M and $105M. 2024’s decline in later-stage funding also corresponds with a decline in mega deals, or fundraises over $100M. 2024 saw fewer mega deals (17), accounting for 21% of the year’s overall sector funding—continuing a decline from 32% in 2023, 38% in 2022, and 56% in 2021.

Increasing early-stage fundraising activity, alongside smaller late-stage deals drove 2024’s total funding numbers downward—a dynamic that gives us important intel as we head into 2025. New startups are attracting investor attention despite a [more tempered](https://rockhealth.com/insights/q3-2023-digital-health-funding-smaller-but-mighty/) funding environment; yet, as we’ll discuss later on, their growth trajectories will depend on how effectively they navigate a Goliath-rich environment. Later-stage startups struggling with downward valuation pressures or stalled fundraising rounds could fold or seek acquisition in the coming year—potentially restarting digital health M&A activity, which hit a decade low in 2024 at 118 deals.

*“Many late-stage players spent significant capital developing and piloting their solutions, but weren’t able to clear the necessary hurdles to operate sustainably at scale. Today’s decrease in late-stage investments will likely lead to more M&A in the near future. These acquisitions may not be ‘champagne popping’ events, but they will streamline operations and free up founders to eventually start a new crop of digital health companies.”  
– Lawrence M. Chu, Co-Chair of Global M&A, Goodwin*

## Navigating investment in the world of mega funds

We can’t talk about 2024’s digital health funding landscape without mentioning a broader trend in venture capital: deployable capital is becoming increasingly concentrated among a select group of investor heavyweights. According to research from [Pitchbook](https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/us-vc-fundraising-concentration-andreessen-horowitz), of the 391 VC firms in the U.S. venture market, 30 funds raised 75% of all of 2024’s committed capital in the U.S., and just nine of those funds accounted for 50%.3

Top VC firms with at least $500M to deploy are often referred to as “mega funds.” Two well-known mega funds—Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) and General Catalyst (GC)—together captured [20%](https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/us-vc-fundraising-concentration-andreessen-horowitz) of all committed LP capital in the U.S. venture market this year. These two funds also led the charge in digital health investment. A16z and GC were the sector’s top investors in 2024, based on disclosed investor syndicates.

Large coffers and brand recognition put mega funds like a16z and GC in unique positions to shape the future they’re betting on. A16z has used its wide-reaching brand platform to [call](https://a16z.com/why-will-healthcare-be-the-industry-that-benefits-the-most-from-ai/) [attention](https://a16z.com/ai-will-save-the-world/) to the transformative potential of AI, priming the market for the [AI](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/ai-and-machine-learning/hippocratic-ai-banks-53m-backed-general-catalyst-a16z-memorial-hermann-uhs) [startups](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-23/andreessen-horowitz-backs-ai-startup-automating-medical-phone-calls) it’s [funding](https://www.mobihealthnews.com/news/counsel-health-secures-11m-seed-funding-led-a16z) in healthcare. GC positions its portfolio companies for success by facilitating synergies across key healthcare partners and assets. From [acquiring](https://hitconsultant.net/2024/11/07/general-catalysts-hatco-acquires-summa-health/) a health system via its company Health Assurance Transformation (HATCo) to forming symbiotic relationships with national healthcare partners like [HCA](https://hcahealthcare.com/about/newsroom/general-catalyst-hca-healthcare-team-up-on-digital-innovation?amp=true), GC carves out “test drive” opportunities for its investments. Mega funds can also provide capital for their port cos to acquire other players, [consolidating](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/health-tech/health-tech-companies-commure-athelas-unveil-merger-plans-drive-automation-llm-tech) [influence](https://www.modernhealthcare.com/digital-health/commure-augmedix-deal-general-catalyst) within key sector [categories](https://www.axios.com/pro/health-tech-deals/2024/12/20/medical-ai-commure-acquires-memora-health-care-automation-general-catalyst).

Mega funds are doing big things to transform healthcare, and their growing influence adds a [new dynamic](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/13/technology/andreessen-horowitz-benchmark-venture-capital.html) to startup relationships. For startups, it’s important to recognize differences between David and Goliath investors and understand the value of working with each. Mega funds can draw market attention and open doors to worthwhile partners, but can also influence deal terms and alter company trajectories. Ultimately, knowing what you’re looking for in terms of capital, terms, and strategic support will help determine which funds are best to have on the cap table.

## The LLMs in the room

To no one’s surprise, AI enablement continued to sweep investor and enterprise attention in 2024. Funding for AI-enabled digital health startups comprised 37% of the year’s overall sector funding across 191 deals.4

![](https://rockhealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Funding-Report_Q4-2024_Blog-Post-Graphics-Deck-2.png)

We see concentration happening in the AI space, too—first, among companies [developing](https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/12/18/1108796/this-is-where-the-data-to-build-ai-comes-from/) foundation models (i.e., large-scale models pre-trained on vast data sets that power entire ecosystems of downstream AI applications). Because foundation models are expensive to build and maintain, they’re [often](https://www.fastcompany.com/91239742/amazon-announces-a-set-of-nova-ai-models) built by [Big Tech](https://openai.com/index/gpt-4/) [players](https://sites.research.google/med-palm/) who can shell out the massive capital needed to acquire data, harness compute power, and deploy staff for model development and management—or they’re the [product](https://fortune.com/2024/11/19/zuckerberg-meta-ai-openai-llama/) of open source [initiatives](https://www.fierce-network.com/cloud/ibms-new-generation-models-carves-path-open-source-ai). Foundation models are so integral to healthcare AI that we call them the ~~elephants~~ LLMs in the room.

There are also digital health companies building upon these foundation models to develop enterprise tech stacks, an application layer with its own share of concentration. Goliaths in this space are incumbent software providers like [Epic](https://www.modernhealthcare.com/digital-health/epic-ai-tool-claims-denial-appeal-automation) and [Cerner](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/oracle-new-ai-backed-ehr-2025/731398/), healthcare divisions of Big Tech players like [Microsoft](https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/microsoft-launches-new-healthcare-ai-tools), and digital health companies that have raised enough capital to compete like [Commure](https://www.modernhealthcare.com/digital-health/commure-augmedix-deal-general-catalyst) and [Abridge](https://www.statnews.com/2024/02/23/clinical-notes-automation-startup-abridge-raises-150-million-takes-aim-at-microsoft-nuance/). These companies have stood up complex AI architectures for large healthcare customers, tend to address multiple [use cases](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/ai-and-machine-learning/cambridge-health-alliance-taps-abridge-ai-medical-scribe-support?utm_medium=email&utm_source=nl&utm_campaign=HC-NL-FierceHealthTech&oly_enc_id=3435B6627690J4X), frequently complete [custom builds](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/ai-and-machine-learning/commure-rolls-out-ai-scribe-tenet-healthcare-after-year-long-customized), meet strict compliance and privacy requirements, and often partner with [one another](https://www.mobihealthnews.com/news/abridge-partners-epic-mayo-clinic-create-genai-nurse-workflow-tool).

*“While there are many companies in healthcare AI, the seemingly low barrier to entry is a bit of a mirage. Similar to how there are clear leaders at the foundation model level, there are select players who can deliver enterprise-grade AI solutions for major healthcare organizations. The bar for success is as high as ever, with stringent and evolving requirements beyond core product capabilities. That said, the effort and investment is worth it—it’s a huge opportunity to create historic impact.”  
– Shivdev Rao, MD, CEO and Co-Founder, Abridge*

Though Goliaths command AI foundation models and enterprise-scale builds, there’s still room for smaller startups to grow—but they’ll need to think carefully about their positioning. There will still be demand for AI solutions addressing [specialized](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenaquino/2024/11/04/how-wysa-is-using-ai-to-make-mental-health-services-more-accessible-to-everyone/) [use cases](https://time.com/7094937/laguna-insight/) or those that work with smaller customer segments like [independent practices](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/ai-and-machine-learning/startup-hello-patient-launches-out-stealth-roll-out-generative-ai-phone). However, these Davids will need to keep an eye on the Goliaths and their roadmaps—perhaps to [work with them](https://time.com/6994739/ai-behavior-change-health-care/?utm_campaign=health_tech&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--227qD1oosvTvSlBQhgTFGFy-Cb387wn0AnXfu3fpnrQmkbf_cX-kvNybC4luT4bI35Eea6PDp1t6puvvr6U5-i0TNwQ&_hsmi=314961888&utm_content=314961886&utm_source=hs_email) or to consider a [path](https://www.digitalhealthnews.com/stryker-to-acquire-ai-based-healthcare-startup-care-ai?) to acquisition.

*“Historically, small- and medium-sized businesses weren’t perceived as big enough markets against which health tech players could justify standing up a direct salesforce. However, a crop of current healthcare generative AI players have implemented viable go-to-market strategies pursuing ‘down market’ SMB buyers. These buyers want gen AI capabilities, but aren’t top-priority customers for larger IT players, and since gen AI products generally have a lower implementation burden, it’s a win-win opportunity for startups and smaller players.”

## Buzzworthy value propositions and clinical indications

Continuing our exploration of sector concentration, we wanted to understand if funding was concentrating within the “hottest” categories in digital health. To evaluate this, we calculated how much of 2024’s overall funding was represented within the six top-funded value propositions and clinical indications.5 The analysis provided interesting results: in 2024, funding for the top six value propositions of digital health startups comprise
