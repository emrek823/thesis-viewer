### Market Analysis & Patient Focus

- Target population breakdown (100 kids):
	- 40% have developmental delays responsive to 1-2 areas of pediatric therapy; can avoid disability/special education by kindergarten
	- 30% need preschool pediatric therapy (delays, not disabilities)
	- 30% have developmental disabilities requiring multi-year, multidisciplinary support
- Current screening challenges:
	- Only 30% national screening rate
	- Ages and Stages screener (from 1995) costs $4-5 per child
	- Pediatricians receive only $7-9 reimbursement, creating negative incentive
	- System issues: outdated state systems, provider shortages, scheduling friction

### Business Model & Operations

- Target facilities: All centers serving ages 0-5 (50-300 kids per location)
	- Includes headstart, daycare, child care centers
	- Offer free developmental screening
	- Weekly therapy visits for identified cases
	- Can integrate screening into enrollment/onboarding flow

Current progress:

- 10 preschool partnerships launching September 2025
