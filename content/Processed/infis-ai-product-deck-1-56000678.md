## Slide 1: Infis: The AI Autopilot for Supply Chain Resilience

# Infis
### THE AI AUTOPILOT FOR SUPPLY CHAIN RESILIENCE
Predict. Prevent. Act. Before Disruptions Become Shortages.

## Slide 2: Pharma supply chains run on hope, not foresight

Pharma supply chains run on hope, not foresight

**Onboarding**
* Endless email chains
* Manual due diligence
* 8-12 months to qualify

**Approve & Register**
* Scattered siloed data
* Risk reviewed inconsistently
* Slow, error-prone communications

**Monitor Compliance**
* Compliance tracking slips through cracks
* CAPAs lost in emails and systems
* Painful audit prep

**Track Risk & Performance**
* Risk logged in Excel
* Alerts are late or missing
* Contracts slip unnoticed

**Act, Report & Decide**
* Static quarterly reports
* No live dashboards
* Reactive decisions

## Slide 4: Every manual step is a delay, a risk, or a missed saving

Every manual step is a delay, a risk, or a missed saving

**Critical supplier data is scattered across emails, PDFs, and shared drives**
Leading to delays, duplication, and missed insights during evaluations or escalations.

**No early warning system for geopolitical or tariff shifts**
leaving teams blind to sudden disruptions that impact raw material sourcing.

**Vendor performance issues are discovered too late**
leading to batch delays, escalations, or emergency re-sourcing.

**High-cost suppliers are used by default**
because there's no automated way to identify approved alternatives in lower-risk geographies.

**Supplier onboarding takes 6-8 months**
due to manual discovery and vetting processes

**Analyst time is drained by repetitive research and manual reporting**
Instead of driving strategy, teams chase data, compile dashboards, and recreate the same insights repeatedly.
