### Company Background & Journey

- Ayushi’s journey had many twists and turns to fix data infrastructure in healthcare
- Both founders obsessed with building better data infrastructure for healthcare AI
- Biggest blocker: data is messy and unstructured
- Background: Ayushi from rural Tennessee family of doctors at FQHCs, studied CS at Princeton
- Andy: PhD at Caltech (finishing next month), focusing on structuring/cleaning multimodal data
	- Physics undergrad, TJ background
	- Dad has PhD in data
- Post-Princeton paths:
	- Ayushi: AI radiology → Harvard Business School → ideating on clinical trials/patient matching
	- Andy: Caltech PhD on data harmonization for multimodal models

### Turmerik’s Approach & Differentiation

- AI-enabled expert data labeling as wedge to infrastructure layer
- Hot take: real agentic doctor can only be built by people who understand data layer
- Unlike competitors (Scale AI, Centaur), they capture explainable labels with reasoning
	- Don’t just get yes/no from doctors
	- Doctors explain why they’re labeling - critical for building future models
- Quality vetting criteria for doctor network:
	- Written communication and query reasoning
	- Comfort with ambiguity (incomplete records vs hedgy language)
	- Care about AI and upskilling
	- Want to be part of AI narrative (hate that EMRs weren’t built for them)
- Vision: Build real agentic doctor in 5 years after nailing data layer
- Current wedge enables understanding where human doctors disagree

### Business Model & Traction

- AI-enabled expert data labeling (current focus)
- Done pilots on synthetic data - bigger contracts, recurring revenue, higher margin
- Have customers and engineering network ready to scale
- Supply of doctors: network effect from initial connections, now scalable
- Moving beyond just labeling to full data infrastructure platform

### Fundraising & Next Steps

- Raising $2M pre-seed with existing term sheet
- Moving fast - hoping to close by next weekend
- Duncan angeling, looking for healthcare-focused lead investor
- References available: Barth at Karnostics (positive), Cam at Credo (more availability)
- Emre to ping Krishna at Karnostics and Cam at Credo for references
- Schedule follow-up with co-founder Andy (Calendly shared)
- Potential in-person meeting this week in Philly area
