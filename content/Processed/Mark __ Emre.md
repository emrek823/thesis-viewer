### Strategic Context & Vision

- Building Industrial Logic deck to present to institutional investors during roadshow
- PurpleLab transitioning to eliminate dependencies on organizations like Clarivate
- Market consolidation expected due to funding environment changes from “splurge economy”
- Key market question: Will winners be data originators (like Inovalon), marketplaces (like Health Verity), or aggregators (like Komodo/PurpleLab)?
- PurpleLab aims to build components across all three categories

### Current Business Metrics & Growth

- Revenue tracking to $80M this year
- Raised $55M to date (capital efficient compared to competitors)
- Current data coverage:
	- 6.5B pharmacy claims
	- 3.5B open medical claims
	- 1.9B remits
	- 2.3B closed claims
	- 200M+ covered lives

### Strategic Initiatives

- Splitting into two operating units:
	- Real World Data Insights (current $80M business)
	- RWD Infrastructure & Compliance Solutions
- Acquiring abstraction company for unstructured document/notes analysis
- Converting point-and-click interfaces to prompt-based cohort queries
- Implementing privacy-compliant clean rooms (addressing issues like Humana/LiveRamp delays)
- Establishing direct contracting strategy for third-party data
- Building claim rooms in GCP/AWS
- Moving frameworks to Databricks (identified as likely market winner)

### Regulatory & Compliance

- Hired Julie Skapic as CMO (Board Chair of HL7)
- Responding to FDA request regarding RWD in drug submissions
- FHIR adoption likely to be mandated
- Exploring research as protected use under TEFCA
- Building secure pipes with continuous monitoring
- Historical parallel: Growth of centralized EKG reading (14M to 500M revenue after FDA mandate)

### Deal Context

- Can raise $300M currently; considering $100M on balance sheet
- Primus (last money in 2022) no longer has veto rights
- Series A with Edison can vote their will
- Potential majority recap in 2026
- JPMorgan serving as banker
- Clarify deal insights: Offered $80M for $35M ARR business with 60% gross retention ($379M raised, only $7M cash remaining)

### Integration & Partnership Strategy

- Integral seen as component of larger ecosystem strategy
- Planning roadshow to institutional investors with blocking rights
- Flexible deal structure: offering shares, cash, or blend
- Working on 5-year contracts with stable supply chain
- Building partnerships for data enhancement and marketplace presence
