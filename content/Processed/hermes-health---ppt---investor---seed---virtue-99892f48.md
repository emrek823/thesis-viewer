## Slide 5: Problem: Identified Data is Stuck in the Past
# Problem: Identified Data is Stuck in the Past
Confidential
Access to Identified Data is Fragmented, Full of Friction, and Labor Intensive

### The Problem
HIEs and TEFCA were designed to enable seamless health data exchange but in practice, its made it worse. Access to identified data is still full of friction:

*   **Fragmentation:** 1,000+ data custodians with limited footprint and coverage.
*   **Multiple Connections:** Requestors need multiple data sources to meet their needs.
*   **Friction:** Labor cost of $100 to pull one medical record
*   **Confusion:** Varying channels to get medical records (fax, bespoke requestor portals, and limited APIs).

**Diagram Components:**
The diagram illustrates a fragmented network where various entities ("Patient Registry", "CRO", "Health Plan", "Clinic", "HIE", "EHR", "Claims", "Hospital", "ROI", "Imaging", "Law Firm", "Life Insurance") are connected to each other with a dense web of lines, indicating multiple, often unstandardized, connections. There are two "EHR" bubbles, one centrally located, and one on the right.

## Slide 7: Solution: Hermes- Fast, Centralized, Simple
# Solution: Hermes- Fast, Centralized, Simple
Confidential
One Network. One Platform. One API.

*   **Unified Front End:** Workflows that enables Requestors to compliantly submit and receive requests for identified data.
*   **Unified Backend:** A robust Network and backend that delivers identified back to Requestors.
    *   Release of Information Vendors
    *   Claims Clearinghouses
    *   Electronic Health Record Vendors

**Diagram Description:**
The diagram shows multiple "Requestor" entities (8 shown) submitting requests. These requests flow into "Hermes - Middleware". From Hermes, the identified data is delivered back to the Requestors through different types of data sources: "ROI Vendors", "Claims", "EHR", and "Facilities".

## Slide 8: Network Effect & Value
# Network Effect & Value
Confidential
Hermes Provides Value to Both the Requestor and the Custodian – Creating a Reinforcing Flywheel effect.

### Requestor
*   **Faster Turnaround:** More Revenue
    Data comes back in minutes instead of weeks
*   **More Data:** More Revenue
    More data enables Requestors to unlock new markets and use cases.
*   **Less Overhead:**
    One API to submit and retrieve identified health data no more bespoke connections, integrations, and maintenance.

### Custodian
*   **More Demand → More Revenue:** Hermes expands your digital intake funnel, making it easy for requestors to submit and receive records driving higher volume and revenue.
*   **One API → Lower Cost:** Hermes handles all requestor integrations through a single API, removing one-off builds and manual fax work to cut engineering and labor costs.
*   **Rules Based Routing → Enforce Compliance:** Custodians set which request types they accept, and Hermes enforces those rules automatically for example, blocking malpractice requests.
*   **Request Validation→ Fewer Cancellations:** Hermes validates each HIPAA authorization before routing, reducing rejections and cancellations to improve margins.

**Hermes Health Flywheel Effect:**
The diagram illustrates a flywheel with four interconnected segments:
1.  **Faster and Easier Records** (leads to)
2.  **More Requestors** (leads to)
3.  **More Record Volume** (leads to)
4.  **More Vendors Integrate to Capture Volume** (leads back to)
5.  **Faster and Easier Records** (closing the loop).

## Slide 9: Network Layer
# Network Layer
Confidential
The Network Layer Simplifies: Access, Compliance and Delivery of Identified Health Data

### Access, Compliance and Delivery Layer

*   **Intake:** Requestors securely submit patient's full name, date of birth, and a signed HIPAA Authorization form.
*   **Authorization Validation:** Hermes verifies that each Authorization meets the minimum criteria for processing. These validations will reduce cancellation rates and risk exposure.
*   **Smart Routing:** The Unity Platform then routes these requests to our network of Custodians based off the Custodians fulfillment rules.
*   **Partner Fulfillment:** Custodians processes these Requests and transmit data back to Hermes
*   **Delivery:** Hermes delivers the data back to Requestors without revealing Custodian specific infrastructure—protecting privacy, and confidentiality

**Flowchart Description:**
1.  **Requestor** initiates a request.
2.  **Secure Intake** receives the request, and **Secure Delivery** sends data.
3.  The request goes through **Authorization Validation**.
4.  Then it reaches **Hermes Platform (Workflow Layer)**.
5.  From Hermes Platform, it proceeds to **Smart Router**.
6.  The Smart Router directs the request to a **Partner (ROI, EHR, or Claims)**.
7.  The Partner communicates with a **Facility**.
8.  **Patient Data Retrieved** flows back from the Facility/Partner.
9.  This retrieved data is sent via **API Delivery** to become **Patient Data** available to the Requestor.

## Slide 14: Business Model
# Business Model
Confidential
We have a Simple Business Model that Scales as our Network Grows.

### Business Model
*   Hermes monetizes the Requestors.
*   Hermes pays the Custodian on a per record or patient basis based on the dataset.
*   Gross margin is the spread between what we charge Requestors and what Custodians charge us.
*   As automation and network density grow, gross margins expand.

| Category                | Price                 | Gross Margin |
| :---------------------- | :-------------------- | :----------- |
| Annual Platform         | $10,000 to $100,000   | 90%          |
| Record Request (End to End) | $50 Per Record        | 20%          |
| Record Request (Routing) | $5 Per Record         | 80%          |
| Site Sonar              | $15 Per Patient       | 66%          |

To Win the Network we Must Execute on the Strategic Goals Below.

**Strategic Goals Diagram (Growth Curve):**

*   **Phase 1: Relevance**
    *   Build Atomic Network
    *   Build the smallest minimum viable network to validate requestor and custodian interest
*   **Phase 2: Ubiquity**
    *   Achieve Requestor and Custodian Ubiquity
    *   Use the momentum to create network to create a self-reinforcing flywheel effect and gravitational pull.
    *   *Indicator: "We are Here" is placed within Phase 2.*
*   **Phase 3: Scale**
    *   Expand to New Markets
    *   Use the network density to expand into more markets.
*   **Phase 4: Monetize**
    *   Unlock New Use Cases

## Slide 16: MOAT
# MOAT
Confidential
Hermes Health's Moat = Network Density × Neutrality × Economies of Scale × Product Velocity

**Connection Density**
More Custodian connections mean fewer reasons for Requestors to build their own. Each reinforces the Network.

**Neutrality**
We don't compete with Custodians or our Requestors. Our Neutrality builds trust and drives adoption. Our Neutrality is our Superpower.

**Economies of Scale**
More volume allows us to negotiate lower Custodian fees, enabling us to pass these savings to our Requestors.

**Products Velocity**
Our workflow innovations make data exchange seamless for Custodians and Requestors. This speed lets us outperform Networks of similar size with slower product cycles.

**Hermes Health Flywheel Effect:**
The diagram illustrates a flywheel with four interconnected segments:
1.  **Faster and Easier Records** (leads to)
2.  **More Requestors** (leads to)
3.  **More Record Volume** (leads to)
4.  **More Vendors Integrate to Capture Volume** (leads back to)
5.  **Faster and Easier Records** (closing the loop).

The De-Identified Data Market Created Comfort and Now to Grow is Expanding to Identified Use Cases

### Custodians
*   Built comfort exchanging de-identified data data across 1,000+ sources
*   De-identified market however is mature and becoming commoditized
*   Growth pressure is creating push for new markets and use cases
*   Limited knowledge of use cases that require identified health data (this was intentional as cultural norm)
*   Early APIs from Epic, Athena, Office Ally, Waystar are starting to create data liquidity

### Requestors
*   Largely unaware that health data can be traded or licensed
*   Still rely on fax and manual workflows
*   Few know how to license or value health data
*   Lack technical, operational, and legal knowledge to implement and integrate with Custodians
*   AI agents are accelerating the need for compliant access to identified health data.

## Slide 27: Custodians Can't Be The Center
# Custodians Can't Be The Center
Confidential
### Why Custodians Can't Be The Center
*   **Competitive Conflict:** Partners compete with each other, making it difficult for any single partner to act as a neutral hub for all.
*   **Limited Footprint:** Individual partners have a limited footprint on a patient data record. As a result they cannot fulfill all requests.
*   **Trust:** Partners don't trust each other and as a result hesitate to share proprietary information directly with each other, restricting cooperation.
*   **Complex Integration:** Direct connections among multiple partners create costly complexity, duplication, and labor.
