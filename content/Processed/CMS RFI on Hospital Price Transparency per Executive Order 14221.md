# CMS RFI on Hospital Price Transparency (Executive Order 14221)

CMS published Request for Information seeking ways to strengthen hospital price transparency enforcement, following Executive Order 14221.

## Executive Order 14221

**Issued:** May 22, 2025 by President Trump
**Title:** "Making America Healthy Again by Empowering Patients with Clear, Accurate and Actionable Healthcare Pricing Information"

**Directs HHS to:**
- Issue guidance ensuring pricing is standardized and comparable
- Update enforcement policies to ensure hospital compliance

## CMS Guidance Changes

Hospitals must now:
- Include **actual dollar amounts** for all payer-specific charges in MRFs
- **No more percentages or algorithms** for negotiated rates
- **No placeholder values** like "999999999" for estimated allowed amounts
- Calculate and report **average dollar amounts** from 835 transaction data (12-month lookback)

## RFI Seeks Input On

- How to strengthen hospital transparency rule enforcement
- How to improve MRF accuracy, completeness, and usability
- What support or incentives might improve compliance
- Prescription drug price disclosure requirements
- State approaches and innovation

**Comments due:** July 21, 2025

## Enforcement

- **Penalties:** Up to $5,500/day for noncompliance
- **Public listing:** CMS publicly lists noncompliant hospitals
- **Reputational pressure** added to financial consequences

## December 2025 Proposed Rule

CMS, DOL, and Treasury jointly proposed changes to payer price transparency regulations to improve:
- Accessibility of pricing disclosures
- Standardization and reliability of public pricing data
