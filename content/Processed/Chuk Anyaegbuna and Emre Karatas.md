### Personal Background & Current Setup

- Dr from the UK, works in digital health across mental health, diagnostics and GP platforms
- Currently on healthcare policy and practice fellowship (Commonwealth Fund Harkness Fellowship)
	- Living in SF/Palo Alto
	- Working on LLM applications to improve clinician experience
	- Fellowship ends September 2025
- Goal: Stay in US afterward, get healthcare product job or found company
- Previous companies always wanted to pivot to US market

### Market Analysis & Investment Philosophy

- Healthcare 1.0 companies (Livongo, Hinge, Omada) valued as tech businesses when they weren’t
	- Should have been funded differently as scalable services companies using tech
	- Actually delivered on employer goals (consistent spend management)
	- Took longer than expected due to misaligned funding/valuation expectations
- Current market advantages over previous generation:
	- Better talent pool - quality founders across all ages (21-60)
	- True tech adoption in healthcare systems accelerated post-COVID
	- Capital, tech, regulatory, demographic tailwinds aligned simultaneously
- Healthcare-focused investing double-edged sword
	- Domain expertise crucial for success
	- Risk of being “too smart for yourself” - missed Ro, OpenEvidence, others due to healthcare investor bias

### Promising Companies & Opportunities

- Vertical solutions solving specific problems:
	- Translucent (portfolio company): AI replacing Excel for health system CFOs/VPs of finance
	- Council Health: Patient-facing AI with impressive approach vs competitors like Dextro
- Horizontal infrastructure companies:
	- Parse (clinical AI interpretability)
	- Amigo AI (game simulation environments for patient conversations)
	- Lumos AI
- Clinical AI moving beyond backend admin into actual patient care
- Key differentiator: Product knowledge + clinical expertise for evaluation rubrics

### Fund Details & Approach

- Fund 1: $30M (2021), 24 companies, ~$1M checks
- Fund 2: $55M, similar strategy with ~$2M checks
- Investment thesis: Everything healthcare except pure therapeutic assets
- 25% portfolio in care delivery, broader aperture than most healthcare funds
- Geographic distribution: Philly 3 days/week, SF monthly visits
- Prefers getting involved pre-fundraise vs reactive term sheet approach
