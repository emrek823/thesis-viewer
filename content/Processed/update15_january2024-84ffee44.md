Dear Solstice Shareholders:

## Last month's focus:

1.  Begin a pilot/trial with at-least two of Rocky Mountain, Astera, West Clinic, Marybird Perkins, or another clinic in our pipeline.
    We did not achieve this goal.
    *   Astera Cancer Care has expressed interest in purchasing Solstice. We have a call scheduled with Astera on January 5th to discuss pricing.
    *   Sierra Hematology Oncology has agreed to go ahead with a trial that will commence in the second week of January (exact date TBD). Since Sierra is a small practice we decided to circumvent the BAA signing process by embedding it in the Terms of Service on the website which they were fine with.
    *   Carol, the clinic manager at Rocky Mountain Cancer Centers, stated that they would like to trial Solstice but would not be able to get the trial started before the New Year since she needs approval from her compliance team. We will re-engage her this week.
    *   We are beginning a trial with Kidney Medical Clinic in Alabama on 1/9 which we set up after an initial call we had with the clinic manager last week.
2.  Satisfy Alabama's admin staff during the pilot and get go-ahead from CEO to implement across the practice through a paid contract.
    We did not achieve this goal.
    *   We've had weekly check-in calls with the medical nurse as well as the new patient coordinator responsible for Dr. Thompson's patients. They are happy with the product, however they have expressed that they only have the need to use it sparingly.
    *   Given they are only retrieving records for Dr. Thompson and he is a surgical oncologist as opposed to a medical oncologist, the nurses here often don't need too much information (pathology report and associated biopsy) which usually comes with the referral fax given the referral is for the specific purpose of a surgery.
    *   We've asked Chris, the CEO to allow us to trial it with their medical oncology team so that they can have a larger sample size with which to judge Solstice's capabilities
3.  Have at least 6 additional sales calls with new clinics for core record retrieval products.
    We did not achieve this goal.
    *   We had a total of 3 sales calls – one with a Gastro that wasn't a good fit, one with Sierra Hematology Oncology who is ready to trial the platform, and one with Kidney Medical Clinic who is also ready to trial the platform.
    *   Our success with outreach in December was not good. Only 3 of our pre-established community oncology contacts responded to our emails – Astera and Sierra as mentioned above and Harbin Clinic who said they are going through a merger so now would not be a good time We sent out 861 cold emails to clinic managers and operations managers at practices across various specialties in Oregon and Alabama and were only able to get 2 sales calls from this outreach.
    *   Our hypothesis for why we did so poorly:
        a. December is a tough month to get sales calls set-up because of EOY deadlines and holidays.
        b. When we previously set up we did so by reaching out directly to oncologists who would then connect us to clinic managers. This time, we tried to go directly to the clinic managers and have seen much lower success. Perhaps selling providers on the clinical pain-point and using that as an entry to the clinic manager is a more effective strategy. We will try this out this week.
4.  Complete risk adjustment case study with Maryland and have at least 5 calls trying to pitch the risk adjustment offering to new provider organizations.
    We partially achieved this goal. We completed the case study but have decided that it's too early to focus on this and have opted to instead prioritize growing the core records retrieval product. We are however going to schedule a call with the Director of Population Health from Community Memorial Health System in California, who expressed interest in the risk adjustment application of Solstice.

## Updates:

1.  Customers
    a. Oregon Specialty Group
        i. Visit
            *   We visited them the week of 12/11 – met Traci, the head of Ops as well as the entire teams at oncology, rheumatology, and infectious disease.
            *   The oncology team has both new patient coordinators and medical assistants who use the platform (~20 total). Everyone is happy with the platform for the most part. Said they've gone from spending 2-3 hours/day each on records to less than 1.
            *   The infectious disease team is not seeing much value because >90% of their patients come from nearby hospitals that they have EMR access to. We will transfer their access to the rheumatology team, who has referrals coming from all over.
            *   Traci gave us many ideas for additional things they are struggling with. We will focus on the core product for now but future directions for us to look into.
        ii. Automating Referrals
            *   Oregon's referrals for new patients come through fax, requiring a new patient coordinator to read the fax and use it to create a patient chart in their practice management software (Unlimited Financials). We made a demo showing how we can automate this and will have her clinic begin beta testing it next week.

2.  Pilots
    a. Alabama Oncology
        i. The nurses are not using the platform too frequently because they get most of the data from the referring provider. They focus on surgical oncology where data needs are not as large.
        ii. Updated Chris (the executive director) on pilot and asked for trial with the medical oncology team as well. We also sent him the demo for automating referrals.
        iii. Realization here and with Oregon is that the platform adds value when there is depth of data needed and when referrals are coming from all over.

3.  Product
    a. Still some one-off issues with Oregon's patients but overall we're able to handle capacity well.
    b. We're building out a more integrated workflow that connects with a practice organization's drive (OneDrive or Google), in which they store incoming faxes. It then OCRs these documents to pull out patient demographics that are used to automatically create a patient's profile in Solstice as well as in their practice management software (Unlimited Financials or athenahealth).
        i. This helps us avoid EMR integration while also embedding ourselves more deeply into their workflow and preventing the need for new patient coordinators and medical assistants to constantly log into the platform.
        ii. Our realization here is that this will increase usage by having Solstice handle all new and long-term follow-up patient intake. By retrieving all the information that a practice needs immediately as their referrals come in, we circumvent the need for manual retrieval anywhere during the patient scheduling process (both by new patient coordinators at the beginning when patients are scheduled and also medical assistants when they later find out they are missing information prior or during a patient appointment).

## This Month's Focus:

1.  Convert at least one of Astera, Kidney Medical Clinic or Sierra Oncology Hematology Oncology to a paying contract.
2.  Begin at least two new pilots outside of the ones with the three clinics above.
3.  Build out an integrated workflow for Oregon and transition the team to this new workflow.
4.  Have at least 10 new sales calls this month.
