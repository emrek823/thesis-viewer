## Slide 2: Delivering Care to your Doorstep

# Delivering Care to your Doorstep

It's time we meet assisted living facility patients where they are to improve health outcomes and prevent costlier forms of care.

## Slide 3: ALF patients are more complex than patients at home

# ALF patients are more complex than patients at home

*   **1M+ Beds** nationally
*   **6.8% CAGR**

**Patient Statistics:**
*   **84** Avg Age of ALF Patient
*   **47%** Patients Visited On-Site
*   **75%** Patients with ≥2 conditions
*   **50%** Patients Hospitalized

## Slide 4: Current primary care options leave too much to be desired

# Current primary care options leave too much to be desired

*   No clinical services performed on-site
*   Sporadic visits from PCPs with large panels

## Slide 5: Current Primary Care Trends in ALFs Need a Fix

# Current Primary Care Trends in ALFs Need a Fix

*   **Poor communication** between providers, resident families, and ALF staff
*   Broken care coordination and **fragmented transitions of care**
*   Increased ED visits, **hospitalizations**, and movement to nursing homes
*   **Siloed data** preventing predictive analytics and targeted care interventions

## Slide 6: Our Response to Fragmented, Backwards Care

# Our Response to Fragmented, Backwards Care
## A tech-enabled service delivering proactive primary care for ALF residents

*   Coordinated Care Teams
*   Collaborative Technology
*   Advanced Analytics

## Slide 7: Collaborative Technology

## Collaborative Technology

Our proprietary technology platform allows us to collaborate with facilities by:

*   **Unifying medical records and documentation** between physicians and the ALF staff
*   **Automate and sync communications** between residents, residents' families, the physician team, ancillary healthcare providers, and ALF leadership / staff
*   **Automate visit summaries** for families to track care plan progress
*   **Remotely monitor patients and build a novel dataset** linking patients to real-time vitals data

## Slide 8: Coordinated Care Teams

## Coordinated Care Teams

Roving teams of primary care doctors and their staff to visit panels of 200 patients per NPI provide:

**For Residents**
*   Routine visits with as-needed urgent care services
*   Activities for patients (e.g., tai chi, yoga, etc.) + ongoing counseling services

**For Families**
*   "Office Hours" for families wanting to communicate with providers
*   Centralized medical information and point of contact

**For Facilities**
*   On-demand training and protocol writing
*   Quarterly live training for clinical staff members
*   Pharmacy consultant for medication reviews and reconciliation

## Slide 9: Advanced Analytics

## Advanced Analytics

Our platform allows for a proprietary, unmatched data-driven view of the geriatric patient's lifecycle. We will use this to:

*   Facilitate **prescription tracking** to monitor **medication adherence** and enable medication **response alerts**
*   **Predict incidents and acute events** (e.g., falls, UTIs, strokes)
*   Guide clinical processes in facilities to **reduce unnecessary transfers of care**
*   Manage care gaps and **identify patients at-risk** of missing preventive services

## Slide 10: Pilot Results (pre-funding)
