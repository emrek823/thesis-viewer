### Healthcare Market Landscape

- Jared’s framework covers 6 core markets:
	- Clinical AI software
	- Healthcare admin software
	- Pharma/biotech software
	- Payer tools
	- Consumer healthcare
	- Tech-enabled services (care delivery)
- Roll-ups as additional category
- Care delivery challenges: labor costs create floor, limited software impact
- Idiot Index concept: product cost/raw materials ratio
	- Tesla: ~100x ratio
	- Healthcare: ~2x ratio (minimal cost reduction capacity)

### Clinical AI & Admin Software Evolution

- Clinical AI historically poor (CDS tools) but foundation models enabling broader use cases
	- Glass Health providing CDS across 95% of clinician tasks vs. narrow specialty focus
	- Most successful implementations built in-house by venture-backed care delivery companies
- Admin software trends toward specialty-specific workflows:
	- Mandolin’s infusion-only focus vs. Tenor’s gastro distribution challenges
	- Bunker Hill evolved from custom radiology models to broader workflow platform
	- Valor uses human services vs. Tenor’s pure workflow automation
- Prior auth complexity: high stakes (only 2 resubmission attempts allowed)
- Supply chain/FP&A automation gaining traction (Translucent, Verse Medical)
- Palantir concerns: health systems resistant after paying to “teach them healthcare”

### Pharma/Biotech & Market Opportunities

- Limited major winners in biopharma software space
	- Blue Note led early round success
	- Komodo stuck at $300M ARR, Benchling under $200M
- Shift toward non-asset companies (Dino Therapeutics gene therapy delivery vehicles)
- Robotics opportunities in lab automation
- Payer market challenges: 3-7% margin constraints, 12-month contract lag cycles
- Consumer health skepticism on peptides trend
- RCM roll-ups face automation risk - customer relationships may lose value as AI advances

### Next Steps

- Emre to share 2x2 framework diagram with Jared
- JPM meeting planned for next week through Friday morning
- Follow-up text coordination for additional time together
