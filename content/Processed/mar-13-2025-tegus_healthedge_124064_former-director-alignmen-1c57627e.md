A: 20 years / 5 payers, and consult in 3 now.

**Client**
Thanks for taking the call. I'm researching the health plan industry. Could you give me a brief rundown of your background?

**Expert**
Yeah. I have 20 years of health plan experience. I focus exclusively in the Medicare and Medicaid lines of business. Three of the five plans I worked didn't even touch commercial. Five years at WellCare, Fortune 500 health plan before Centene bought them from 2005-2010. Five years at a non-profit plan, five years at AmeriHealth Caritas as a director. Over a year or two at Highmark, three years at Anthem, and currently I'm consulting in like three plans.

CAHPs software to me is claims, config, and enrollment. The medical management side of the house is totally different. That to me is not considered CAHPs. One of the health plans I worked in, we outsourced claims, config, and enrollment because we were under 500,000 lives. The TPA goes out and purchases the, we call it a, claims engine, if you will.

I do the evaluation pricing. There's six things I go through in evaluating these solutions. There's the CAHPs side of the house, which is over in operations. I want you to think the other side of the house, which is medical management, which is prior auth, case management, concurrent review, quality HEDIS, appeals and grievances, pharmacy type stuff.

If you're focused on CAHPs, that's an operation. Twenty years in health plans and I focus mostly in the managed care space, which is where we spend the most money because we're fully at risk. Unlike commercial. Hate to say it, we don't care. We turn around to the employer and be like, "Hey, your spend was this. Give us that plus 4% for our admin and margin."

**Client**
When you say outsource, does that mean the decision around implementation and selection is outsourced or literally BPO, someone else is processing your claims?

**Expert**
You got it right. BPO is a term we use or TPA, third-person. I was at a non-profit plan that was smaller, we went to Royal Health, so I had to evaluate the BPO. Royal Health, I selected because they were paying claims for another health plan that had a similar network to mine. That was one of the reasons why I picked them. That's when health plans will outsource their claims, config, and enrollment to a BPO or TPA. Sometimes it's to another health plan. When I was at AmeriHealth, I paid the claims for Blue Cross Blue Shield New Jersey. People don't know that. We were the TPA or BPO for Blue Cross Horizon. You actually got it right.

**Client**
Interesting. Sounds expensive.

**Expert**
There's a reason for that. The claims engine these companies have when they go into new products like Duals and MMP and LTSS or Medicare Advantage, their claims engine can't handle that so they're not going to get a new one. They might have that product claims outsourced. That's a lot of the stuff. They don't want to implement a new engine. I was consulting for Aetna Medicaid. They use QNXT just for their cave business. Sometimes you'll see in these health plans different engines depending on the product. QNXT, which is owned by Cognizant, just like Facets that's adjudicating the Medicaid claims at Aetna.

**Client**
Okay. I wanted to get your general sense of HealthEdge versus Facets, QNXT, FX&C, NASCO, like just what is the install base look like in terms of share? In your experience, who's taking share and why?

**Expert**
HealthEdge to me, their offering is more on the medical management side. They do not have much market share when it comes to being a claims engine. GuidingCare and Wellframe that sit over in the medical management side of the house. They have good market share. When it comes to CAHPs, and remember, I'm defining CAHPs as claims, config, and enrollment, they don't have much market share.

Everybody's trying to grow their scope. Inovalon is my quality engine for HEDIS stars. They want to become my provider portals, but I'm using Availity and NaviNet. Cognizant owns QNXT, it owns TriZetto, and it owns Facets. I can clearly say that over 50% of all lives in America, their claims are being adjudicated by a Cognizant product. You're going to say, "How do you know that?" I worked at Anthem, I had under 50 million lives. That was all Facets. I worked at AmeriHealth Caritas, we had under 10 million lives, all Facets. Now I've got more.

United is using Facets for a lot of their members. I don't know how many they have. Now I'm well over 100 million in lives. Highmark, I was using Facets and other plans are using it. That's a Cognizant product. Cognizant owns QNXT, I forget how many caid lives Aetna has. I know Illinois had 365,000 caid and I was consultant for the Illinois Medicaid market. The Cognizant solutions, whether it be QNXT, Facets, TriZetto, they have the lion's share of CAHPs solutions.

**Client**
You've not come across HealthEdge's their Health Rules Payor?

**Expert**
I've evaluated it. Here is the thing and nobody want's to here this, health plans do not change claims engines for many reasons. We can talk about that if you want. Health plans will evaluate it, but in the ninth hour they'd never change. The stickiness in claims engines is extremely strong. It's the strongest of any solution. After that, it's going to be your provider portal, after that, your medical management platform. Anyone who's in sales or thinks that they're going to roll into a health plan and get them off their claim engine, they're wrong.

I've evaluated it and I implemented HealthEdge GuidingCare at Highmark. Before HealthEdge owned it, it was Altruista that owned it at that time and then they bought it, the medical management. I've never used that for the claims engine. I've used their medical management platform, just like Jiva ZeOmega for medical management. They are not known as a CAHP system. Just like Inovalon isn't known as a provider portal, but they want to get in that space.

**Client**
Interesting. You said you did evaluate their CAHP system or not?

**Expert**
I did. We never used it. It's too hard to change and give me 10 seconds here. The way a claims engine works is we have to load every provider's contract. Think about that. That means if I were to implement a new claims engine I have to then reload all of my providers contracts because that's how it auto adjudicates claims. That is a monumental task and it's also ripe for error.

All of my providers from ER to inpatient to DME vendors that sell adult diapers to catheters, all of that needs to be reloaded and then the member benefit designs because it's going through that pick logic. That is a monumental task and health plans do not want to A) do that and B) the risk of configuration reloading that stuff and now it'll pay incorrectly so that fear and then that amount of work is involved. That's why we don't change claims engines.

**Client**
Is there anything that might be changing that in terms of like a lot of these legacy installations or homegrown systems or even Facets the on-prem version from 10 years ago? Are they becoming outdated the way a lot of like old monolithic stuff in other industries have been gradually?

**Expert**
No. I'll tell you, already 85% of the claims auto adjudicate, so when I hear people talk about, "Oh don't you need AI to pay claims?" I'm like "No, nobody's pricing the claims." We load the CMS fee schedule, we load our contracts with providers, we load the member benefits and then it goes through pick logic, all that stuff to auto adjudicate. I think the only problem that's going to be with claims engines as the government makes these more exotic products like MLTSS and D-SNP, C-SNP and a family member can be a provider and do personal care services, that's where you run into problems.

Equestrian therapy, that's now a benefit for members that are amputees that can ride a horse so it feels like they have legs, claims engines can't handle that. As long as they're able to revise their rules/edits, I don't think you need to tear it down. Does that make sense? That's really the pain point and I had that with Independence Blue Cross. They owned AmeriHealth when I was there. Their claims engine was designed for commercial insurance.

AmeriHealth Caritas, I had D-SNP, LTC long-term care, LTSS. Those members have wild benefits stuff. You're like, "Wait a sec, how is that? Why is a health insurance company paying that?" These claims engines weren't built with that in mind. Whoever's going to be successful is going to where they can reconfigure the solution to handle those benefits that you wouldn't have thought five years ago a family member providing care. As long as a family member doesn't live in the same home and they have a tax ID, they can submit a claim. It's crazy out there now.

I wouldn't say the whole thing's got to be torn down is like, is it scalable? If anything, they're poised to knock out these payment integrity vendors. That's what I don't understand why none of these claims engines have eaten their lunch yet. That's always been my belief. It's like, "Why am I paying Cotiviti or Change, or Ciox to look at claims to tell me what to short pay and deny?" They get 25% of the savings. Just have those claims hit my claims engine.

If I have edits in place, it should know what to deny or short pay. That's where I see things evolving is in the next five years hopefully these claims engines are like, "Wait a second. All these health plans are using payment integrity vendors so it goes from the clearing." I don't understand why they can't knock those guys out. We put edits into.

**Client**
Are you familiar with the Burgess product? Which helped you and also they call it Source.

**Expert**
Burgess has been around since 1978. I've used them and they recently just got acquired because the wife who inherited it didn't want to run the business but I know it well.

HealthEdge now owns it. They call it Source. They renamed it from Burgess. What's your sense of that product?

**Expert**
It's strong because they've got decades of experience in payment integrity. They've been around a long time. They inherited that history now and hopefully they don't break it.

**Client**
I think the way they're going to market is they're trying to sell that along with their CAHP system.

**Expert**
That makes sense. That would be the way to go. I didn't think of that.

**Client**
Interesting. Does Cognizant have some version of that or were you always layering in?

**Expert**
You got it. We were always up front. When I was at AmeriHealth and I had six million lives, overnight they would get our outpatient claims, they would tell us what to short pay or deny. They would get a percentage of that savings and then that hits our claims engine. They want to run it under their nose before it hits our claims engine.

I would argue with our CFO, because CFOs think, "There's no risk because if they don't find anything, they don't get paid." I said, "That is a risk. Had this hit our claims engine, would it have denied it? Furthermore, they're telling me what to do. Why can't I self learn what they're telling me to short paid and die and throw those edits into my claims engine?" That's where I don't understand.

**Client**
The prepaid payment integrity, it hits before the claims engine claims it's progress?

**Expert**
Yes. Some vendors wanted that way.

**Client**
The claims engine might have rejected half of it anyway, you wouldn't have to pay for it.

**Expert**
That's my point to my CFO. I said, "Why don't we just have it hit our claims engine? We load edits in place." His thought process was, because CFOs like to manage risk, "We're not paying them a monthly reoccurring rate. Like $2 PMP on our six million lives." In his mind, we're only paying them if they find anything. I'm like, "Our engine may have prevented that." Do you see what I'm saying?

**Client**
Is that the way they all work? They all the claim before the claims engine?

**Expert**
Yes. Now, there's post-payment vendors. We call that pay and chase. The vendor I used for that was called HMS. They got bought. I don't know who owns them now. That's pay and chase. That's a recovery effort. That's usually a higher percentage because it's harder to capture the horse after it leaves the barn. Whoever bought HMS was the guy I used.

Obviously, I also used subrogation vendors. They would look at paid claims, "My God, this was a car accident. We got to go collect from the car insurance company. This person got hurt in a New York City park. I got to collect." That's a subrogation vendor. To me, that's still pay and chase.

**Client**
Yeah. On the prepay, payment integrity version, you weren't doing that through a separate module that Cognizant was offering you were integrating Cotiviti or someone else?

**Expert**
That's how all the health plans work. Even at Anthem, there's a payment integrity vendor. Not all claims will go to it. Sometimes there's specialty vendors that want to look at our high cost NICU claims. Think of it like that. They want to run it under their nose before it hits our claims engine. Which makes sense. If you're a vendor, you don't want it to go through our net first. That's something that I don't understand. Why wouldn't we filter it out first before giving it to them? No, these payment integrity vendors, they get it from the clearinghouse or they get it from us before we run it through our claims engine. It's essentially the same thing.

**Client**
Meaning before claims engine is the CAHP system. That's where you're saying?

**Expert**
Yes. I think CAHPS claims, config, and enrollment. Config is loading contracts. Enrollment is enrollment. That goes hand in hand with the claims engine.

**Client**
Yeah. Basically, in your view, there's nothing in the industry or no technological use case such that all of these CAHPS engines need to be cloud migrated, but they're good enough as they are as long as they can be edited in some way to handle these LTSS innovation.

**Expert**
New products, LTSS, D-SNP. These new products that the government makes us manage. These new products have a very wide range of benefits, stuff that you think an insurance company should not be involved with. Acupuncture for people with opioid use dependence. When does a health insurance company pay for acupuncture? It's not real science, but now they do. That's weird.

**Client**
You're saying that's not enough to cause a rip and replace.

**Expert**
That's my point exactly. Here's the thing, over 80% of claims auto adjudicate, which means no humans touching it. The reason why it's that low is we put edits in place. If the units are off or they're using a modifier on a claim, we want it to kick out to have someone look at it. When I keep hearing about AI or machine learning claims already auto adjudicate. It would actually be higher if we made our contract simpler.

Tech isn't going to change the way claims auto adjudicate because that's already in place. Tech can fix case management over on that side of the house when it comes to prior auth, but when it comes to claims adjudication, there's not much there. It's either a facility claim or a professional claim and then it looks at the provider.

**Client**
Is there something about being able to take it from over 80% to 98%?

**Expert**
Here's the problem, we have a fear that we're going to be overpaying. We put edits in place to kick it out. I could dial it up. I could start taking edits out. Like on the units for certain drugs. Those are the injectables. Don't think retail pharmacy. I can increase my auto adjudication rate. Do I really want to do that? That's the whole thing. We could do that. On professional, if it's under $2,500, we just might let it go through if it's above $2,500. Stop it. Professionals, your PCPs and specialists.

I can increase my own adjudication rate, but do you really want me to? Claims review people are cheap. It's not like I'm going to be saving a ton of money. A really a way to do that is in your contracting make your contract simpler. Another way to do it is ensure configuration was done correctly. That's why a lot of claims will get messed up and it'll kick out. The person who loaded the contract isn't the one who inked it with the hospital. Their interpretation of it is totally different.

I think that there's room for software in that when somebody sits down with a provider to negotiate a contract, have it on a tablet that actually does the configuration. No more need for a configuration department. You've got network ops. When they're negotiating with a provider on the tablet, they're doing it there. That is actually doing the configuration.

**Client**
Is there something about large national plans versus regionals and Blues that makes the CAHPS system stickier the way you're describing? My sense of it was from speaking to your colleagues in the industry is that there's some rip and replace happening in the mid market and regional plans but the large payers.

**Expert**
That's true. Anthem's not getting off of Facets. That's not going to happen because we'd have to reload all those contracts. Not only is that a monumental task, it's ripe for error. Now, you got to reload those things. I think that's part of it. It is a seismic lift to do that. It doesn't matter if it's hosted on site or in the cloud. Somebody's got to reload thousands of provider contracts. I'll tell you, that'll go sideways and then the claims will pay incorrectly and you'll piss the provider off.

I think the medium-sized plans the reason why they're looking is they're starting to get into these more exotic products. The larger plans were already doing LTSS, D-SNP, MLTSS. The medium-sized plans also use TPAs. They're looking to buy a claims engine because they may insource claims. That's another reason why. I agree with what you said. I don't think it's a function of something happening. I think it's the mid-sized ones have used TPAs, the mid-sized ones are getting into products that the current solution can't handle.

When I was at Highmark, just in my Delaware market alone, I had 5,000 LTSS members. My premium was $7,500 a month. That's a lot because the benefits were insane. Private duty nursing, personal care, somebody could come to the house and do dusting and fold your laundry. Why would a claims engine need to be able to pay that? Because now it's a benefit. I remember we were using a Blues engine for a while and then there was this like W-code.

Case management is another thing. If a provider wants to do care coordination and case management. It's like an S-code or a T-code in caid, can a lot of claims and just can't handle that. The big Blues plans can't handle that but that's a benefit in Medicaid. That's a benefit in Medicaid where you're going to get bill and they view that as medical, not overhead so it'll go through the claims. It's really a more of is your solution scalable? That's why I think these medium-sized plans, they've done commercial, they want to get into managed care, caid care, their current engine can't handle it or they've been using a TPA.

**Client**
Got it. Let's talk about the medical management modules. It sounds like you've got a bunch of experience with those, so GuidingCare and Wellframe, what's your experience?

**Expert**
GuidingCare is really good. I implemented it when Altruista owned it. I used Altruista Health to implement it and I loved it. You're going to say, "Why'd you love it?" I was using Jiva ZeOmega at my prior company and the thing was awful. The other thing I liked about when I bought it from Altruista is I could buy modules. I don't need your quality module I'm already getting that from Availity. I don't need the MTM piece, I'm getting that from PBM. I really, really like that I can buy modules. I don't need the quality, don't need the MTM. Definitely need the case management system. Definitely need the appeals module. I really like that. I really like that I could load my own medical policies into that as well. Jiva ZeOmega was awful when I was at AmeriHealth.

**Client**
Your own medical policies that's what you're saying?

**Expert**
They had their own too. They had their own, but I could load my own into it as well. The other thing is the nurse's notes. It was a seamless system where I got about a 10% efficiency by using it. Keep in mind HealthEdge didn't build this, Altruista did. We bought it when it was owned by Altruista and then HealthEdge bought it and just changed the name. You get what I'm saying? That's what happened.

**Client**
Interesting. Who was the competitor you used before? Jiva ZeOmega?

**Expert**
Jiva ZeOmega. MedHawk is good too. I know their CEO. He was the CIO WellCare when I was there but they wouldn't let me buy modules. They wouldn't let me do à la carte. I'll say this, their medical management platform is also NCQA HEDIS certified. Everybody's trying to be everything in this space. The thing you got to understand, and nobody in investment banking or consultants want to hear this. If you're labeled as a CAHPS system, I want you to draw a line down your piece of paper. That's claims, config, enrollment, member services. That's operations. That's under the COO.

On the other side of that paper, I want you to write medical management, which is prior auth, concurrent review, case management, HEDIS quality, pharmacy appeals and grievances. Those solutions are not the solutions that you use over in operations. That's just the way it is. All of these companies are trying to jump the hurdle and grow their scope.

There's another swim lane, which is the provider portal, which is NaviNet, Availity. They want to move into medical management. It's very fragmented and you don't cross paths. You're under three different executives too, by the way. That's COO for CAHPS, claims config, enrollment, member services, and then the CMO chief medical officer is the prior auth, case management, concurrent review, appeals and greet. It's going to stay that way.

**Client**
You've got a different buying persona is what you are saying. HealthEdge is offering all of them but your sense is it's not.

**Expert**
You understood it. I like that you're not arguing with it. Same with the Inovalon. I've used them as my HEDIS engine for 20 years in five different plans. They've been trying to be my provider portal for eight years, but everybody uses Availity, everybody uses NaviNet. We're not going to sunset that. That's the thing. It's like, "Who are your clients for a provider portal?" They're like, "Uuh," exactly.

**Client**
What about Wellframe?

**Expert**
That's a module within the medical management platform.

**Client**
Yeah. That's more of a patient interaction.

**Expert**
This is the thing. We're already doing that in case management. To me, it's a module within the medical management platform GuidingCare. Our case managers are already engaging the members. The case managers have what's called a panel assigned to them, like 120 members. You could be a maternity case management vendor. You could be a diabetes case manager. You're already using the medical management platform to manage your census.

I don't understand where these member engagement tools come in. Is it a module within the medical management platform? Is that the piece within that the case managers use? That's the part that confuses me. To me the medical management platform is what we're using for case management already.

**Client**
Okay. The differentiating feature on GuidingCare is that you can buy modules and what else was better about it? You mentioned it was more efficient.

**Expert**
It's more efficient from the nurses workflow, so from the notes to getting EMR from providers, getting information from the provider portal and pushing stuff to the provider portal is more efficient. Now, not to confuse you here, the latest craze in Medicare is to delegate medical management to PCP groups. The first provider portal that is able to basically do medical management is going to win.

The latest craze is to pay all the PCP groups a monthly amount of money and give them case management. The MA plan, playoff their nurses, doctors, pharmacists. We then pay a cap rate to an MSO of like $5 PMPM and now the onus is on them. Who's going to be the customer of these medical management platforms? It's going to be the providers because we're now delegating care coordination to them. It's already happened in math. Is it going to continue into caid? I don't know. That's like the latest thing when it comes to medical management is pushing that to the.

**Client**
This is the value-based care pushing it to the provider group.

**Expert**
You got it. This is one and the same. If the provider's at risk on MOR, they're doing the care coordination. If they're doing the care coordination, they're going to need a platform to do care coordination. Who then buys that thing? Does the health plan buy it and give it to the provider or since we're paying them that monthly cap rate, do they turn around and buy it? Good answer. You got like 50% of it right.

If a provider's at risk or value-based agreement, I call it at risk because to me VBC is at risk. If they're at risk, usually we've delegated care coordination to them. If that's the case, do we really need as many users for a medical management platform? Does the MSO, who does the back office scheduling, billing and care coordination for the providers, do they turn around and buy a platform? That's the weird thing that's going on in the industry in medical management.

**Client**
Are any of the EMR vendors that serve these provider groups doing that or thinking they need to do it or is this too far afield from their core competency, which is patient charts and things like that?

**Expert**
This is the thing. At AmeriHealth, we took the provider portal, we had NaviNet there and now we're using Availity. Everybody's using one of those two. We pushed our open gaps and care into that solution. It wasn't calculating the HEDIS measures for stars. We were using Inovalon, pulling it out and then somehow getting it into the provider portal. The provider thinks, "Oh my God, Availity is great. It's giving me my open gaps in care." "No. It's just displaying the actual calculation of Ms. Smith needing a breast cancer screen," that's being done in Inovalon.

I think the solution that can be the most successful is going to be the solution that's able to do medical management because PCPs are being delegated. Social determinants of health, closing gaps in care. All this stuff. The health plan's doing less and more is being pushed to the PCP group, so the provider portals need to be adjusted as so does that make sense?

The claims engines don't need to do anything. Plans are going to pay claims, they ought to adjudicate. The real shift is who's doing what. We're now delegating care coordination. I've been in the business 20 years. Used to be called case management, now it's called care coordination, so we're giving them what's called a cap admin. That's a fancy word. A reoccurring payment every month. "You've got 20,000 of our MA members. We're going to pay you to do the care coordination. Here's $5-$15 PMPM. You handle it." That makes sense. Go ahead.

**Client**
Is care coordination a thing in employer-sponsored commercial plans?

**Expert**
We're not at risk. We don't care. Now, they can buy that from me. When I was at Anthem, I had Home Depot, Verizon, all the state employees of Louisiana, we don't care about the spend because guess what it's called an ASO model. I just turn around to those major employers and say, "Your spend was $2 billion. Give me $2 billion + 4% for my admin and margin. See that's my career has been in the carry case."

**Client**
Let me ask this. What about when you go for renegotiation the following year and Anthem is more competitive because they have better care, whatever it is, so you have to win that customer every year but care coordination as a cost control measure is not used as a mechanism to be more competitive?

**Expert**
Unit cost is our hospital contracts. Now, employers think they're getting cute right now going to TPAs. This is where employers really screw up. The latest craze right now are these self-insured employers, which is most employers, they're self-insured. They're dropping the big Blues and they're going to TPAs. They're saying, "If I'm already at risk, why can't I just go to a TPA and have them pay the claims because that's all you're doing Blue Cross?"

Here's the problem with that. TPAs don't build networks. They have to go out and rent a network from a company called Nations First Benefits. Nation First is going to charge that TPA a nice fee for the network. What does that TPA do with that fee? They pass it on to the employer group. All these employers think that they're going to save money by leaving these plans. They're going to go to a TPA. Their whole attitude is, "I'm already at risk. Why not just go to a company that's essentially a claims engine?" The problem is TPAs don't have leverage and contracting, Blues plans to go pull the JSON files, the price transparency. Go pull the JSON files and look and see.

The third-party administrators are not also captive operations within the plans themselves, those are independent players?

**Expert**
I used Royal Health when I was at a non-profit plan. Accenture has a BPO, Wipro, Tata Consulting. These are all TPAs. You got it. I went to Royal Health to adjudicate my claims because I had under 500,000 lives. It was way too expensive for me to go out and buy a claims engine. I went to Royal Health in New York because they had similar health plans to mine that were in the same market because they're already paying claims to the same providers. That was one of the reasons why I picked them.

They had similar product, Medicaid, Florida, some exchange members, etc. That's one of the reasons why I picked them is they already had those providers in their system. They just needed to load my enrollment and pay on behalf of me. Think of it that way. We're losing commercial self-insured because employers think they're going to get a break. The problem is they're not because the TPA needs to go out and build a network. They're not good at negotiating contracts so they have to go rent one.

Just like these small start-up plans, they have to go rent a network. They can't build a network and they have no leverage. Like Curative the small plan in Texas though, like 30,000 lives. They're renting their network and they're trying to build their own. Hospitals have no time to meet with a plan of 35,000 lives.

**Client**
Why is a self-insured employer thinks they're going to get a better deal from a TPA than from a regional carrier? What's the calculation that they're doing in their head?

**Expert**
They think it's a lower ASO fee. In their mind is, my insurance company they're not at risk. I'm taking on all the risk, so why don't I go to a place with a lower ASO fee? There's a problem with that. Your medical is going to go up because that TPA doesn't have better provider contracts.

**Client**
Yeah. You're saying that the TPA is going to take a lower percentage but on a higher base basically.

**Expert**
It's going to be a higher cost of care because that TPA doesn't have contracts like BUCAs. Just pull the price transparency files. These employers are like, "Oh, lower ASO fee. If my spend is $1 billion, $1 billion + 3% is cheaper than $1 billion + 6% or 5%, I'll have savings."

**Client**
Since we're on the topic of network construction, were you using Quest Analytics for that in your experience?

**Expert**
All Quest is for network integrity geo access. That's what it's used for. That's a requirement, is also G3. We also internally in my department, because I'm provider economics, I can count distinct provider tax ID by county divided by my enrollment. A provider's team tells me their specialty. Quest doesn't have anything special. There's no special sauce. In managed care we get fines if we don't have what's called network integrity geo access. That will tell us where we have gaps in our network. That's their real value proposition.

Yes, they're trying to sell some price transparency stuff also but that's really what people use Quest for. You don't have enough cardiologists in Fulton County because you've got 200,000 members. That type of stuff. Keep in mind, a health plan can go to their provider table Facets provider was the name of my table count distinct provider tax ID because remember, I have a provider table and then group by their specialty. Now, I know how many cardiologists I have and then I divide it by my membership, then I can tell if I have network. Their main solution that they sell is do you have gaps in your network?

Here's the other thing. We have to submit a PNB file weekly, which is our provider directory. The states and/or CMS will come back and say, "You have gaps. If you don't close it, we'll find you." My team can go to my table of providers, count distinct provider tax ID group by specialty, divide by membership, meet some ratio. Plus, we got to submit that stuff constantly.

They'll give us a warning like in North Carolina I didn't have enough skilled nursing facilities. The state came after me. One time, my non-profit, I got a fine for not enough birthing centers. I don't even know what a birthing center is, but I got a penalty. They fined me between $3,000 and $4,000. Telehealth helps us get around that. I have a behavioral health vendor they can just call problem solve.

**Client**
They're basically helping you meet regulatory network coverage requirements. What's not clear to me is I think you started alluding to this, you guys have provider data management files that are separate from what they're selling.

**Expert**
We have to know our provider directory non par. Otherwise, how does it know whether to pay that claim or not or price it out? We have a provider table and in that provider table, I have their specialties.

**Client**
Is there something about the massive.

**Expert**
There's no secret sauce that they have. Don't think of it. It's not like Inovalon for quality. When I was at AmeriHealth, we had one license request, but more often than not, the network ops department would come to my department and say, "Tell me how many pediatricians or endocrinologists are in this area type stuff." They're going to come to us. All I do is go to the provider table and do contract. Term date is null. Now that tells me who's still active for that specialty boom, done. There's really no secret sauce to Quest. J3 is another one. That's why they're trying to move into this price transparency stuff.

**Client**
Yeah. Is that differentiated their price transparency capabilities?

**Expert**
The problem with price transparency is it's everybody's charging a ton of money and there's about five main users in this stuff. This is where the problem is, I only want to pay for particular provider tax IDs, like Robert Wood Johnson of New Jersey. I want to know what the other payers are paying them. There are limitations with price transparency, if you want, I can tell you. It doesn't help a plan that much and there's reasons for that. I can explain that if you want me to. This is what people don't understand with price transparency.

That's wonderful. I know what United pays by code to Robert Wood Johnson. Here's the problem. I don't know where United's utilization falls in all those codes, so you've got all these codes paying all these different percentages of Medicare. On these codes over here they're contracted at a high percentage of Medicare. They might not have any utilization in those codes, but over here is all their utilization, and that's another high of Medicare. When you go to contract with them, you don't really know United, I'm going to use this Anthem term, relativity to Robert Wood Johnson. Where relativity is when you price out all the claims to a given provider, where does it fall?

The best you can do is say 50% of the claims fall below 140% of Medicare. You know, if you go to contract with that provider, you can go off for 140%. What I do for my clients I break it out 25%, 50%, 75%, meaning 25% of the codes are under this, 50% are under that, 75% of that. The problem is I don't know where that utilization is falling.

For my clients, I show them I've ingested all the JSON files. No different than turquoise, no different than that's publicly availabl. All these companies are selling free online coupons. That's all it is. It's publicly available. You can do NYU price transparency. It'll bring you to their page where you can pull down that data and it has to be in a standard format. That's all these companies are doing.

**Client**
Getting back to the geo access point, when Quest says A) we have more accurate data on who all these providers are and where they are because that's always changing, because they're changing offices and whatever else. B) We can present that information with a level of integrity that you can feel confident that it's being submitted to CMS and whoever accurately. Your response to that is my provider data management files are sufficient for me, I don't really need that.

**Expert**
You got it. It was never a tool used in any of the plans. Just like J3 has something that's a competitor of theirs. They're not doing anything special. They're not pricing out my provider saying, "Oh, this guy's relativity is 107% and this guy's 103%." They're not doing that. They're not pricing out my providers. They're not doing a contract analysis saying, "Chesapeake Urology has all these carve outs. You should try and carve those codes." It's not doing that. See what I'm saying? You're on the right track. What you said is actually what I told my VP when I was at AmeriHealth. Word for word how you worded it.

There's not a strong value prop because you're not telling me anything I don't already know. It's like somebody telling me my frequent flyers. I'll go into my claim system count distinct claim ID where place of services, 23 group by member ID, done. That's all they're doing is by a provider specialty and a provider's tax ID or NPI dictates their specialty. Just like a VIN number on a car. It'll tell you if it's a four door, the color, all those numbers will lead to something interesting.

**Client**
Interesting. You've got this data in other places, it's just they might aggregate it and submit it more efficient way.

**Expert**
You got it to. Think about it. We have to have that information because we have to move that into our claims. We have to have our provider directory because that's how it prices it too. If it's a non par provider, if it's a Medicare member, that doc has to collect the difference at time of care of what we pay a par doc and their fee. All that we have to have that.

**Client**
The reason I'm asking is because I've heard they've got contracts with most of the major plans and Blues and with CMS and others. I've heard from others the same thing that you're saying, which is this is it's not like the value proposition isn't huge but it sounds like they're using it somehow or another.

**Expert**
This is the thing. They have a license with it, but they really don't use it. At AmeriHealth, we had one data scientist who actually had the license, but she really wasn't using it. She was turning around, going into Facets provider table to answer the needs of our network ops department. Does that make sense? It's like it's there, but we're not really using it. That's a true statement. We're saying the same thing.

The analyst wants to feel more in control. They want to go into the enterprise data warehouse. They want to go into the provider table. They want to set contract term date to null or 12/31/9999. Now, I have all my active providers and I don't want to filter by a county or a zip code. They want to back into it themselves. There's really nothing Quest can tell us from my feeling that we don't already know and I believe that's why they're trying to get into this price transparency stuff.

**Client**
Well, thank you again for your time today. This was very helpful. Bye.
