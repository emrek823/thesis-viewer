### Will’s Clinical Demand Intelligence Platform Vision

- Clinical demand intelligence system - connective web between EMR and ERP that’s operationally focused
	- Behind every procedure: fixed amount of resource demanded (X number of SKUs for supplies, collection of clinicians, equipment)
	- Can back into demand-based forecasting and administrative automation around supply chain and staffing
- Problem identification:
	- Finance tools for hospitals emerging (Translucent, Midstream) and clinical ops tools (LeanTaaS for OR scheduling) exist
	- Nursing and administrative functions (supply chain/staffing) don’t communicate
	- Data around OR usage is very poor
- Research validation: 3 months deep research, 50+ industry conversations including 30+ clinicians, toured surgical centers

### Market Opportunity & Product Strategy

- Target market approach:
	- Go-to-market wedge: Ambulatory Surgery Centers (ASCs)
	- Ultimate goal: hospitals (where big spending occurs)
	- ASCs have aligned clinical/financial incentives (physician co-owned), single specialty focus makes easier sell
- MVP focus: AI-powered preference cards
	- Preference cards = case prep lists for every CPT code by performing physician
	- Current state: outdated, on note cards with scribbles, PDFs, static EMR dropdowns
	- Creates waste through expired SKUs, costly alternatives, one-off additions that get opened and discarded
- Three ROI formats:
	- Cost savings (10% supply savings would be substantial)
	- Better operational insights and people cost reduction through automation
	- Improved charge capture (30% lift in chargeable supplies per Assist IQ model)

### Next Steps & Funding Plans

- Will’s timeline: planning to launch coming into new year
- Seeking to sequence early product development with customer conversations, discovery, and funding
- Interested in raising money toward end of year
- Follow-up meeting planned for coffee in NYC
- Emre noted potential inclusion in Virtue’s negative-one-to-zero founder gathering before Thanksgiving
