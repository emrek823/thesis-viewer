## Interview conducted on May 22, 2025

### Topics
Healthcare Automation, Workflow Efficiencies, Patient Inbound Flow, Financial Forecasting, Employee Reallocation, Technology Implementation, Trade Shows, Customization Options

### Summary
A CFO and EVP of operations at Total Medical, a DME supply company, chose Tennr for healthcare automation tools after meeting them at a trade show due to their flexibility and customization options. The implementation process involved connecting Tennr to existing software solutions for improved efficiency, leading to increased productivity and the ability to service more patients with fewer employees. While considering Synthpop, concerns about patient age and cost led to the decision to go with Tennr, which is seen as a leader in the DME space. The expert emphasized the challenges of transitioning to a new vendor and the importance of having a diverse technology tech stack.

### Expert Details
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer at Total Medical Supply Inc., a current customer of Tennr and two-time evaluator of Synthpop. Expert was the decision maker in evaluating and implementing Tennr and can speak to the products being leveraged, company use cases, evaluation criteria, and the two evaluations of Synthpop, most recently in February 2025. Expert has an up-to-date understanding of Synthpop and its offerings and can speak to why they did not move forward with the solution.

Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer at Total Medical Supply Inc. The expert manages 175 employees and is responsible for overseeing the day-to-day operations of the business including, but not limited to, implementing new technology, optimizing workflows, IT development, overseeing compliance, optimizing supply chain management, logistics, etc.

## Client
Thanks so much for taking the time. We're looking into healthcare automation tools. We'd love to just get started and learn a little bit about your background.

## Expert
Yeah. A little bit about me, I've been with Total for maybe five years in about two weeks now. I've done a little bit of everything for the company. Now, I'm our chief financial officer as well as our executive vice president of operations. Day-to-day roles and responsibilities, I've 20 directors underway on the operations side, so anything from workflow efficiencies, getting orders in and out of the door, maintaining a good patient inbound flow.

From financials, I do all of our forecasting and predictions. I have a team of controllers that handles all of our accounting and just standard financial health of the company. Total Medical, we're a DME supply company, so we provide healthcare products, specifically continuous glucose monitors to patients across the country. We drop ship all of our products to about 50,000 patients in 48 states. We have roughly 175 employees.

Part two of your question, the lead up to looking into workflow automation tools, our CEO is a very traditional guy and been in the space for almost three decades now. He's been big on hiring team members and employees. We really weren't doing anything from an automation standpoint. We were big on hiring more and more. We got to a point of critical mass. As we continue to grow and put on more patients, it obviously takes more bodies to service those patients.

At the very end of 2023 and starting into Q1 of 2024, he came to me and said, "I'm ready. Let's begin to do some due diligence and research into workflow automations." That was the birth of it. We were wanting to scale patient counts without scaling a linear employee growth rate as well. We began to do some digging into the different healthcare automation tools.

## Client
Got it. The pain point was more of a growth question? It wasn't that your employees were not able to do certain tasks as accurately or efficiently, it was more, "We're growing so fast. We need to either hire more bodies or find software to make our employees work faster?"

## Expert
It was both. Software definitely can do things more efficiently than our physical employees can. It was a point where we were hiring three to five employees per month. It was a tool to where, "Okay, how can we implement technology to either reallocate existing employees in departments that can be automated to not put them in other departments that maybe cannot." It was both. It was for scale, but it was also reallocation of certain people and departments to other areas.

## Client
Got it. I believe you're a customer of Tennr today. Could you give us an overview of how you found Tennr, what the process looked like for the sale, what the implementation looked like, how you're using them today?

## Expert
Tennr was actually the last of our companies to evaluate. We met them at a trade show called Metrade in Dallas, Texas in the Spring of 2024. From the start, we could tell they were a very initiative young company that were very eager to learn and adapt to anything we threw at them. That was our biggest selling point.

Something we wanted was a tool that would really mold to our workflow. A lot of software companies are very, "This is what we do. This is how we do it." You've got to play around their puzzle piece. Instead, they felt more moldable. It was a solution that would fit into the cracks, and we could mold it how we wanted it to be. That was the promise that sold us on Tennr. Of course, the price was very competitive with other solutions we looked at.

Ultimately, the customization options that Tennr offered were the biggest driving point for us to sign the contract to go with Tennr. From there, we met them, let's just call it, first week of March, and we were signed within a month. Within April of 2024 was go-live. From there, we did a phased-implementation approach.

We currently use four models within Tennr, and I'm sure we'll get into all four of them. That very first implementation, we had to do a lot of connecting Tennr to all our different software solutions. Our DME-specific EMR we use is called Brightree. I would say it's probably the industry leader for DMEs. We had to get them plugged into Brightree. We had to get them plugged into our third-party fax service, which is called Concord.

The first two weeks, we're just making sure all the connectors were in place for them to start utilizing their automation tools for improved efficiency. The first thing we implemented was fact wrangling. Part of our business, we have to get documentation.

Being a DME, we are a federally funded, if you will, company, meaning our revenue is generated from insurance payers such as Medicare, Medicaid, and the Medicare Advantage plans. We get a lot of faxes that come in the door, all these different documentations from medical records to billing correspondence and everything in between. We obtain roughly 1,200-1,500 faxes per day.

Prior to Tennr, we had a team of four individuals that were going through fax by fax, and they were assigning those to the proper departments to make sure that the correct eyes were on each document. We'd have those teams say, "Yep, this is a billing correspondence. Yep, this is a prior authorization request. This is that, this is that." We taught Tennr how to do that automatically.

They took that four-person team down to a one-person team, and they were going through those faxes each and every day much more quickly and efficiently and assigning those to the proper department, if you will. That full implementation after about a week and a half to two weeks of the credentialing that I mentioned, that took about two and a half to three weeks for a full go-live. I'd say it took a little longer just because they were learning us, and we were learning them, but it was a good segue into other things that we implemented after.

## Client
Got it. Would you give us a sense of just quickly a broad overview of the capabilities that the Tennr platform has? What are all the high-level buckets of things you can do that are automated or augmented with the Tennr platform?

## Expert
The high-level thing, fax wrangling, the first one I just explained, so looking at a fax saying, "This needs to go here or there." Also, from that, they can go into our Brightree platform and say, "Yes. This is an existing patient. This is at this product line or that product line." The next process is referral entry or referral intake.

It's taking an unstructured fax document and saying, "Okay. If Total Medical wants to keep 33 unique fields within Brightree for every new patient, we're going to extract that data and put it into their EMR for them to go look at." Also, we can to qualifications. I can tell Tennr, "Hey. These are the five criteria points that a patient must meet to be qualified for the product we provide." It will then review the fax document. It will let us know if it does or does not meet the necessary qualifications to obtain the product, and it would inform us of that.

From there, it can do sorts of functions within Brightree. It can log documentation. They're called WIP states. It can move different things within Brightree. The options are truly endless on the things it can within Brightree and with the faxes and then also starting to do more insurance eligibility, so review and saying, "This patient has Blue Cross of Tennessee. Based on the plan that Total Medical has with Blue Cross of Tennessee, this is the coverage amount, this is the reimbursement amount, and so on, so forth."

## Client
That makes sense. Thank you for the product overview. When you think about interacting with the Tennr platform, how hard is it to use their UI? Was there any training you had to do for your employees that made it

painful or annoying to learn how to use the Tennr platform? How do you think about the way it saves time? Is it that it makes each employee faster or more knowledgeable? Does it just automatically do the work for you? How would you quantify that ROI?

## Expert
From the UI standpoint, the Tennr platform is very intuitive. It almost guides you along the way. Whenever I train somebody in Brightree, it might take two weeks to get somebody fully up to speed, and you're still going to be learning. I've been here five years, and I learn new tips and tricks of Brightree every day, where Tennr is a very plug-and-play model.

It is very straightforward, very intuitive. There's not a lot of filler information on there. They very much so customize it to what you need to see is what we're going to display to you. What I might want to see as an employee of this company is very different from somebody else. It's very intuitive, and it's tailored to exactly what we need to see. it's a very much so enjoy the platform.

From an aspect of ROI, depending on the worker, there's different ways of classifying the fax wrangling, most of Tennr, I would say, is not a touchless automation. It does not just say, "Okay, I'm completely removing all of these people's jobs." It still has slight touch points, but from a fax wrangling and referral intake standpoint, if I knew that I had eight employees that were able to produce so much volume output per day, and now I can have one person doing double what those four used to do, there's my ROI there.

A big calculator we look at is the amount of patients that we service on a monthly basis comparatively to the amount of operational employees that we have. Since we've started Tennr, that ratio just keeps getting larger and larger. We're able to service more patients with less and less employees. That's been the biggest calculator to determine the return on that investment with Tennr.

## Client
Got it. Do you like having it being like a system that you have to touch? Would you prefer if it was touchless? I'm just wondering, for you or other peers in your space within healthcare automation, how do you guys think about how much trust you have in that system and whether people are ready for it to be touchless?

## Expert
I think it depends on the areas. There're certain areas that we're working within truly, weekly, daily to make more touchless. Some of them, there's still a component. Working with federal payors such as Medicare, we're liable for audits and recoupments and all kind of things. There are certain areas that I don't really ever foresee nor want it to be touchless just because I do want that person that has much more knowledge than just an AI solution might have to validate and say, if they misread something or misinterpreted something, I'd rather have an employee double checking that.

To answer that question more directly, there are points that we want to be touchless and we are in the works of making it more and more touchless by feeding more data through it, but then on the other side, there are things I never want to be touchless, and we're going to continue to have manual review over those.

## Client
Got it. Switching gears a little bit, I think from the pre-screening it said that you had evaluated Synthpop in March of 2024. I guess the first time you went to see Tennr and then again in early 2025. I would love to just hear what happened in both of those times when you evaluated them. How that process went, what you liked and didn't like? How it compared to Tennr back then and then more recently and then what was the decision making around going with Tennr at each of those times?

## Expert
The 2024 evaluation of Tennr, we were looking at them at that time for more of the document automation worker that was our first intro into this healthcare automation was taking off the manual touch points of documentation, those fax documents, cleaning things. It was a similar profile as to what Tennr has now.

It did not feel as customizable. It was much more one-dimensional. It was like, "Hey, this is our solution, this

is how it works," whereas Tennr was very moldable. That was that first decision-making. It was just the pure customization of Tennr. We saw them as an endless opportunity partner to have, and we could come to them with different little nuances and things that our company specifically has. There was no buckle back or no kickback towards us. That was the first why we decided with Tennr from the beginning.

The reevaluation here, beginning of 2025 wasn't even regarding documentation, it was more regarding AI outbound phone calls. Part of our business is it is heavy resupply. These patients get shipments every 30 days or every 90 days depending on product payer mix. We have a full team of individuals that make these outbound reaches to, "Hey, Patient XYZ, you are due for your next order of resupply. Would you like to continue with your shipments, so on, so forth."

We looked at the option of utilizing Synthpop's auto outbound AI phone call service to implement that. I would not even say that is a competitor to Tennr. I've not really spoken with Tennr about that stuff, so I cannot tell you if they are or not looking at that. We did a little bit of research into Synthpop with that so a different direction than our use cases with Tennr.

## Client
Got it. What was the conclusion from that in each of those times? With document automation, it sounds like Synthpop was less flexible, so you didn't go with it. With the volume for AI agents doing outbound phone calls doing outbound phone calls, what was the conclusion with regards to Synthpop?

## Expert
They provided a lot of comparison data pretty much saying, "This is the percentage of time we get patients on the phone versus if we made 100 outbound reaches, this is the percent that the patients are going to pick up the phone." A lot of comparisons seem to be much higher.

Obviously, resupply is generating 85%-90% of revenue for the company. I don't want to implement a solution that is costly, that's going to take away phone call outbound reach and have less turnover rate or less call answer rate. That was the decision making there. Whenever we first met them, we met them at an event, and they were saying, "No. This is the price, this is the cost. "Once I actually got a contract in my hand to review, the cost was completely different.

That just didn't sit well with me. Don't sell me on something then change a price on me. I'm not a fan of that. The more that we just sat on it, slept on it, and thought about it, average patient age for our customers are 71, 72 years old. We were very skeptical of going towards an AI outbound phone call with patient of that age population. WE just ultimately decided to put that on the back burner and focus our efforts in other areas.

## Client
Got it. Your human phone call rate, outbound success rate was higher than what AI outbound phone calls demonstrated?

## Expert
Yes.

## Client
Combined with the age of your patients, how you felt about them, you just decided not to pursue a voice AI solution, or have you pursued something else?

## Expert
No. We're not pursuing a voice AI solution as of now. From everything that people have spoken with, I didn't do a lot of diligence on other companies, but they were the leader from the peers that I've spoken to that utilize them. I feel like if we were to decide to go that route, it would be them, but as of now, we're holding off on that and focusing elsewhere.

Do you think that's something you might revisit in the future to the extent to which AI becomes even more improved and capable?

## Expert
Absolutely. I do think that is something that will be in our forecast. It doesn't call in sick, it doesn't leave on maternity leave. You don't have to pay a commission, all the things. I do think it's in the forecast. As of right now, it's not a Q2, Q3, Q4 plan for this calendar year. I do foresee it with the advancements it being there.

I think it's the similar method to how we were with Tennr. Darby is another competitor of Tennr. I would say they're probably the first one that I've heard of in this data automation space. We've heard of them for a couple of years now. I think there will always be the new and newer competitor that has awesome technology. I do think we'll eventually end up in the AI outbound space.

## Client
Would you guys ever consider replacing Tennr with another product if it had newer and better tech? I guess I'm trying to get a sense for how sticky Tennr is within your workflows and how difficult it would be to replace them.

## Expert
This is always an interesting question. I truly cannot imagine having to go through all this again because of the way that we implemented Tennr, which biasly I think was a very smart way of doing it by doing this phased approach. If we have four active Tennr workers, we didn't implement all of those within the first six weeks. It was really an eight-, nine-month implementation one after the other.

If we shut off all four today, and even if I started with just fax wrangling module, in the meantime, if it took me four weeks, which I think would be quick to go live with company B, I'd have to hire people for the other three solutions that I've been able to make up time. One of our workers, just for perspective, the qualifications worker, we've had an employee here for about seven years, and she's an absolute wizard and rock star in our qualifications team.

Her record day of looking at faxes and reviewing medical records to determine qualifications was like 302. Within the first week of go-live with that worker on Tennr, she surpassed 700 within the first week. I'm just thinking like, "Okay, if she's able to do that and now we have other people that have 2X and 3X productivity, if I shut off Tennr today, I'm going to have to hire at least three to four employees for that department, get them trained up to speed, and I'm going to have to train them in Brightree, which is way more complex than Tennr."

I would say it's a very sticky product. I truly can't imagine. We've heard of these. Notable is a really big up-and-coming one that a lot of my peers are discussing. The nine-month transition to a new software would be a nightmare.

## Client
One more question, it sounds like your peers and your verticals talk a lot and share a lot of technology recommendations. What is your sense of the market penetration of, call it, like tenor, and it sounds like Synthpop, I'll throw that one in? Would you say there's a leader that's emerging or would you say that a lot of different types of folks are using different vendors?

From my understanding, it sounds like tenor has been going after, call it, like mid-market/more like smaller clinics. Maybe that's not the case anymore. Maybe Synthpop is pursuing more of like a enterprise-type sale. I'm just curious, what are your preconceptions of both in the market and who's using them.

## Expert
From a tech stack perspective, most people that I know, I would say we're a large mid-market DME. I mean we're number five in the CGM. I would say that most people are using the three-headed monster that is Brightree, Parachute, and Tennr. I would definitely say those are the leaders in those three niches within healthcare. They're all very different even though they all talk and do similar things, they're all different in

their own way. I would say those are the three-headed monster that I find a lot of.

They might just be the peers that I speak to directly because I'm going to call somebody like, "Hey, how do you use this part of Brightree?" Like, "Oh this, I'll do it" or whatever. In the workflow automation space, I would be hard pressed if anybody said there's a bigger Goliath and Tennr, especially in the DME market. That's just my take. Most people I've spoken to, I know another company that is probably 10X our size that just signed with Tennr. They're a big deal. They're big in our space.

## Client
What have you heard of Synthpop in the market?

## Expert
Synthpop really feels like they've taken a different direction, more towards that automated outbound. Even whenever I saw them at a recent trade show, it wasn't a whole lot of the document automation that like Tennr does. From my feeling, it seems as if Notable has taken on more of the competitor to Tennr in the documentation automation space. I hate the double Asians, but that's more of the feeling that I get. It's not as much Synthpop on fax documents. It's more of Notable.

## Client
Got it. It sounds like the solution with Tennr is quite sticky. That being said, if there was a competitor that came out and the product was 10X better, could it be done? Could a transition to another vendor be done?

## Expert
Absolutely. In the hypothetical, if I got a call today, I was like, "This is the best thing since Sliced Bread," and they could prove it to me, I would probably have to bite the cost bullet and do an implementation while I have an active contract. Obviously, I have to have legal review that to make sure I'm good to do that.

In this very hypothetical, that's how I think I'd be like. If I have Tennr doing these four things and company XYZ comes in, they can do all four of these 10X times better, I would do a phased implementation while I have the other one active and just bite the price bullet. I would launch. I'd be, "Okay, I'm implementing phase one. I'm going to reduce phase one over here. That's out." I feel like that's the only way I could do it. I don't think I could say, "I'm turning off Tennr today and turning on product XYZ today. I'd have to hire 15 employees."

## Client
Separate question that's related, if company B in the same hypothetical, instead of doing 4X, Tennr does, say, four things, instead of doing those four things 10X better or cheaper or whatever, if they did more horizontally, if they did 10 things as opposed to the four things at the same price and relatively similar performance, is that attractive to you? How narrow is Tennr solution for what they do across healthcare administration operations?

## Expert
I think if that were the case in that hypothetical, I would just have both platforms. Whenever I look at our company and I look at the eight different departments and the 150 operational employees I have, I really do not think we are missing outside of maybe one area to where I could implement workflow automation or document automation.

I still have probably 20 people on the phone right now talking to patients. I have people talking to doctors' offices. I think there are some touch points that we could eliminate, but I still think they are in Tennr's wheelhouse. That is the thing is we are not by any means a Tennr's exclusive provider. I use other workflow automation tools that add on.

We have a seven or eight technology tech stack that it's not just a Tennr touches everything. We use some of Brightree automation stuff. We use a company called DME Flow and their automation stuff. I think in that hypothetical, unless it was just like they can do this for half the price, which I would be hard pressed to

believe because software companies are greedy about money which is fair, whatever they do, I would believe it, but I see what you are saying. I think we would just add on.

## Client
Got it. Thank you so much. Really appreciate the time. Have a great rest of your day.
