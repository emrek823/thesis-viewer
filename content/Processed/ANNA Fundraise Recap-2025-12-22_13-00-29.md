### TCAP Fundraise Post-Mortem

- TCAP withdrawn from transformations hybrid/preemptive fundraise
	- Initial signals positive but process became problematic
	- Excessive, non-market diligence volume and minutiae
	- Inflexibility on pricing/structure
	- Used co-founder transition news as exit excuse
- Team consensus: dodged a bullet
	- Process so poor Virtue will disclose to future founders
	- TCAP appeared to look for reasons not to do deal
	- Blessing in disguise given poor partnership fit

### Future Fundraising Strategy

- Pencils down on current fundraising - not needed operationally
- Focus areas for next 3-6 months before Q3/Q4 raise:
- Target Series B metrics for $25M+ raise vs $15M
- Timeline: Q3 or Q4 2025 fundraise expected

### Co-Founder Transition Plan

- Clinical co-founders not scaling per team feedback
- Strong Chief Clinical Officer candidates identified via exec search
- Original buyout plan (via TCAP proceeds at $75M) no longer viable
- Sunflower Capital willing to facilitate secondary buyout:
	- $1-1.5M investment at $50M valuation
	- Structure as secondary share purchase, not primary capital
	- Conversion to preferred shares likely required
- Alternative approach discussed and preferred:
	- Standard 3-month severance package
	- Allow co-founders to retain equity
	- Extended option exercise period (1-2 years)
	- Full release of claims required
- Timing: Equity discussion soon, operational transition in January
- Rationale: TCAP fundraise collapse provides leverage, removes urgency for buyout

### Next Steps

- Budget review for 2026 with operational streamlining
- Strategy alignment meeting scheduled for blueprint/tech roadmap
- Co-founder separation process to begin with equity retention approach first
