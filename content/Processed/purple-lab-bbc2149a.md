## Slide 1
THE
REAL WORLD DATA
IS
CHANGING
FASTER
THAN
YOU
REALIZE

## Slide 2: Convergences Reshaping RWD

**Top Level Convergences:**
*   **Claims + EHR + unstructured docs**
    *   Can you de-ID and tokenize unstructured data at scale?
*   **Privacy-compliant environments**
    *   Can your third-party RWD be used without violating licensing?
*   **Rollups, M&A, PE exits**
    *   Are you positioned to acquire, be acquired, or partner?

**5-Step Process (Chevron Diagram):**

1.  **RWD Expansion**
2.  **FHIR Mandate**
    *   FDA shift to FHIR-native submissions
    *   Can your data be converted into FHIR-compliant format?
3.  **Clean Rooms**
4.  **Agentic AI (LLMs+MCP)**
    *   AI access to enterprise data via secure bots
    *   Can AI be embedded securely in your data workflows?
5.  **Market Consolidation**

## Slide 3: 1. Expanding RWD Needs Beyond Claims

Life Sciences RWD Strategies Are Evolving

*   Claims data is no longer enough
*   Structured EHR + unstructured documents and notes are now required.
*   This creates two new imperatives
    *   De-Identification & Certification (Expert attestations required)
    *   Tokenization & Interpretation (Need for NLP/AI abstraction of unstructured content)

## Slide 4: 2. FHIR as a Requirement, Not an Option2

FHIR Adoption is Becoming Mandatory

*   FDA is signaling FHIR as the future format for regulatory-grade RWD.
*   OMOP-to-FHIR tools led by academic ecosystems (e.g., JHU, Georgia Tech).
*   Companies must translate native formats (e.g., OMOP) to FHIR to remain compliant.
*   Expect major demand growth for translation tooling and services.

## Slide 5: 3. Clean Rooms Solve RWD + LLM Compliance

Privacy-Compliant Clean Rooms Enable Trusted Data Use

*   Data owners are resisting LLM training due to perpetual license risks.
*   Clean Rooms allow:
    *   Limited-term, scoped data access
    *   Non-public model deployment
    *   Controlled output (model results only)

## Slide 10: RWD V2.0: Commentary

Arms race of Open and Closed Claims coverage driven by both clinical and commercial data needs

Datavant's success and growth created new markets and opportunities for first party data originators. These data originators realized their liberal use rights language combined with data aggregators aggressive interpretation of those use rights lead to a combined loss of governance as well as commercial licensing opportunities.

Inovalon was one of the first to pull their data from DRG, forcing data aggregators to contract directly, while prohibiting reselling to other data aggregators. Inovalon's coverage of closed claims provided them a dominant position where they were able demand more restrictive terms which effectively limits licensee's operational leverage.

This model is being extended by other data originators, such as Evernorth, CVS/Caremark, Optum Rx, Change and even smaller sources, such as FinThrive leading to:
a. High licensing costs (putting PurpleLab's gross margins and free cash flow at the mercy of our data suppliers)
b. Restrictions on fields of use (i.e. limiting end markets which impacts our ability to scale topline revenue)
c. Restrictions on applications of use (i.e specific use cases within end markets such as Evernorth's prohibition on use of their data for underwriting)
d. Restrictions on techniques of use (i.e. restrictions on training AI/ML models for commercialization, creation of synthetic data, etc).

**X-Axis (Patient Completeness):**
*   Left: Niche
*   Right: Comprehensive

**Quadrant Content:**

*   **Top-Left (Census, Niche to Comprehensive):**
    *   **Use Cases:** Life Science Commercial & All Other Segments
    *   **Companies:** surescripts, IQVIA, Symphony Health (An ICON plc Company), healthverity, komodo, Clarivate™, LexisNexis
*   **Top-Right (Census, Comprehensive):**

    *   **Companies:** McKesson, Inovalon
*   **Bottom-Right (Sample, Comprehensive):**
    *   **Use Cases:** Life Science Clinical Segment

**Right Side Commentary:**

*   Life Science Commercial teams, Advertisers and Payers and Providers require a "census of coverage" (e.g., all geographies, all HCPs, all HCOs, etc.)
*   Life Science Clinical teams need a "sample of coverage" (e.g., a therapeutic area, single indication, etc.) but require "patient completeness"

## Slide 12: RWD V3.0: Commentary

Data originators enter the arms race on their own.

Increasingly, data originators (particularly insurance companies along with their diversified business units and/or closely held PBM's) are going direct to pharma with analytics and services leveraging their data. Examples of this include the following:
a. CVS RWD, Evernorth Clinical Trials Service
b. Optum Life Sciences
c. Blue Health Intelligence (BCBS Association), Carelon Insights (Elevance) and EVIO
d. Forsyth Health (joint venture between Express Scripts and Centene)

Inovalon and Veradigm represent other examples of partners' balancing channel strategies with direct-to-pharma go-to-market efforts. Collectively many of these businesses are defined by the same characteristics:
a. Data as a by-product of revenue generating activity (data licensing being entirely profitable at the onset with margin compression as they invest in more direct efforts)
b. Legacy businesses with technology as an afterthought versus a focus
c. A (sometimes misplaced) confidence in the value of their data independent of other similar data sets

## Slide 16: RWD V3.0: PurpleLab's Options

Arms race of Open and Closed Claims coverage driven by both clinical and commercial data needs

These data originators are laying out a strategic roadmap for what PurpleLab (and other data aggregators) need to do to succeed in the future. Specifically, our success will depend on our ability to “bend the curve” of data licensing costs. There are four primary avenues through which we can reduce data licensing costs:
a. Create a unique data asset through aggregating data from multiple sources (create common data and synthetic data)
b. Provide technology products/services to 1st party data originators, including “clean rooms” and privacy compliant workflows and pipelines (i.e., Integral)
c. Buy or build a “marketplace” (i.e., Prognos or build the “switchboard” that Datavant failed to do)
d. Become a first party data originator and get rights in Claims, structured EHR and unstructured documents and notes as a by-product of revenue generating activities

Seeing data as a by-product of revenue generating activities requires focusing on three market segments that primarily deal with identifiable data workflows:
a. Payers
b. Providers
c. HCIT (who service combinations of the segments)
