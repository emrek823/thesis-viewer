### Sam’s Background

- Imperial biomedical science degree
- Early startup experience: 5-person biotech in Berlin developing rapid pathogen detection for food logistics
- Key roles progression:
	- Part-time software engineering during undergrad
	- German business communication software (1.5 years)
	- Global Genecorp: genomics data pipelines for 100,000 Genomes Project
	- Illumina: population genomics tools for large-scale datasets
	- Chan Zuckerberg Biohub: DataHub project using graph databases
		- Graph database approach: exciting but potentially over-engineered
		- Managed metadata across 13-14 research groups with different data modalities
		- Avoided maintaining 15 different SQL schemas
	- Inscripta (via boss transition): cloud infrastructure then clinical data team
		- Clinical data team: organized national biobanks and acquired datasets
		- Atlas project: unified API across different data modalities (3D radiology, single-cell transcriptomics)
		- Tablet biobank data structure for easier access and curation

### Quinn & Eitri Assessment

- Founder-market fit: Quinn fits profile of methodical VP of biomanufacturing he’s selling to
- Iteration capability: evolved from internal biopharma data science tools to current focus
- 9-month relationship building before investment
- Strong references from previous colleagues
- Market opportunity:
	- $350B total biomanufacturing spend
	- Currently 3-5% software capture vs traditional 1-2%
	- $360B committed to US manufacturing footprint by top 20 biopharma
	- CDMOs are high-margin, sticky businesses with large contract values

### Sam’s Interest Areas

- Information transfer problem: scientific data exchange between CROs, CDMOs, biotechs
	- Current process: 50+ page documents requiring manual review
	- Key statistics buried in lengthy presentations and papers
- Eitri’s wedge approach: extract key statistics from documents, present unified view
- Standardization opportunity:
	- Create standardized semantics for key statistics
	- Develop file formats for data representation
	- Streamline CDMO-to-biotech, CDMO-to-pharma transitions
- Data infrastructure experience aligns with making “data simple to access”
- Early-stage startup appeal: intensity, pace, agency, wearing multiple hats

### Next Steps & Milestones

- 2026 focus: team building, wedge validation, customer acquisition
- Target customers: 2-3 biotechs or CDMOs as initial design partners
- Seven-figure ACV potential once solving core problems
- Long-term vision: marketplace connecting biopharma and CDMO worlds
- Platform balance: nail specific wedge (batch record review, yield optimization, tech transfer) while building extensible foundation
