## Summary
A chief administrative officer for a retina-only practice in California shared their positive experience with implementing the voice AI platform Assort, which has reduced missed calls from 1/3 to 25%. Assort's strong connectivity with athenahealth has allowed it to manage 4,500 schedule-related calls per month with a patient satisfaction rate of 4.5. The practice is looking to expand Assort's capabilities to handle new patient referrals and has saved six-figures annually by eliminating the need for outsourcing patient-financial-assistance programs. The main goal of using Assort is to alleviate administrative burdens on existing staff and empower them to focus on high-level work. The Tegus Client and the expert also discussed the breakdown of spend within the platform, particularly with Assort, Sintra, and Stealth AI, highlighting the benefits of these tools in improving documentation accuracy and reducing denials.

# Client-Expert Conversation on Voice AI in Healthcare

## Client
Thanks for the call. I am interested in learning more about voice AI platforms in the healthcare industry. Can you provide an overview of your background?

## Expert
I'm the chief administrative officer for a retina-only practice in California. We have six locations, seven physicians. We see about 45,000 appointments a year and we get about 10,000-12,000 phone calls a month. Prior to utilizing any sort of voice AI agent, we developed an internal call center that was staffed with three people. One on-site and two that were off-site.

With those 12,000 calls, before our call center, we were missing about 1/3 of our calls. Once we implemented the call center, that number came down to about 25% of our calls were being missed. We were looking at ways of improving that missed call functionality, and also just continuing to try to keep calls focused to our call center instead of being shared or sent to our front desk, which was the backup to the call center but we wanted to reduce the number of calls that the front desk was getting.

As we were looking at different options for us, which was about a year ago now, we thought that maybe we need to build up our call center by adding more resources, adding more people. I was a little hesitant to do that because it was very challenging even getting three people that we could train up and retain and were doing the job that we wanted them to.

I was open to different options. Around October, November of last year, Assort actually started reaching out to us because they're a partner with a few other athena clients. athenahealth is the practice management system we use. The athenahealth conference was coming up. I speak at the athenahealth conference. They really wanted to meet me. I get inundated with tons of requests so I was ignoring them for a little bit because it was a busy time of the year for us. I happened to be at the conference, walking by them, and I was like, "Let me see what they're about."

What I did was test them out in real time. I just called one of the clients that they'd said that they work with, which is an orthopedic practice in Maryland. I was really impressed right away with how it worked in terms of at least the calls that they were addressing, which were schedule-based calls. I was impressed because it sounded like a human, it was very easy to follow.

I felt that orthopedics and retina, different specialties, but there's overlap and similarities in terms of how we take calls, the types of calls we get, and the scheduling, and the fact it already works with athena, which is a huge deal for me because all of our scheduling happens through athena.

Around October, November, when we started exploring working with an agentic AI, specifically Assort, at that time, that was the only one that had the full build-out with athena and had some athena clients. I looked at a couple others like Hello Patient and stuff just to see what the market was like.

At that time, the other products didn't impress me as much and didn't have that full connectivity in other athena clients like Assort did. We signed a contract and ended December, and from January through March, we worked with them on building out a more retina-specific, ophthalmology-specific application of Assort focused on addressing schedule-related calls.

We have to teach it specific rules, specifically around how a patient that's on a treatment plan, how much earlier can they schedule their call, how much later can they schedule their appointment as they call in to try to cancel these two appointments based off of the different types of diagnosis or the different symptoms that the person is calling about, as well as making sure that because our physicians rotate through practices, it's able to place the patient with the correct physician at the correct location as well too. At the end of March, we went live. Since then, Assort has been managing consistently about 4,500 of our calls. These are all schedule-related calls.

## Client
Per month?

## Expert
Yeah, per month. Found out that a lot of our calls are patients. Even though we do appointment reminders and things like that, a lot of our calls are patients calling to cancel, reschedule, validate their appointment. It's been doing a really good job with it. Our patients are happy with it. It has about a 4.5 patient-satisfaction rate. It's seamlessly integrated into our workflow. Now, we're exploring other types of calls that Assort didn't answer, so that we can expand its capabilities and potentially, reduce call issues that we continued to have been significantly reduced.

## Client
That makes sense. When it comes to that interface where you're building out more specific workflows for your practice, is that you working with their support team or is there an interface where you're configuring your own agents?

## Expert
It's working with their support teams to build that up.

## Client
Makes sense. What was the onboarding process like?

## Expert
It was very good. Being their first retina practice, they were very open to learning our workflow. They came and visited our campus, met with our staff to really gain an understanding of the challenges we have, and what the outcome is that we desired, and whatnot. It was a really good onboarding. We were hoping for a much quicker onboarding but as we're going through it, came to understand why it was important to have this slow and measured onboarding.

I would think since we've onboarded, I know they started working with other retina practices, and their onboarding with other retina practices has been a little quicker because they've been able to adapt the protocols and whatnot that we built with them.

**Sean Doolan**
Now that's there, I think it's just going to continue to be a quicker onboarding for a lot of other practices.

## Client
During the sales process, what did Assort claim were their top differentiators?

## Expert
At that time, just the connectivity that they had with athena, how strong the API was, and the fact that they had a few athena practices already as clients. That was the main selling point and what attracted us to them.

## Client
Got it. How did they prove that to you in the sales process, or was it just something you saw as you were demoing the product?

## Expert
Just through demoing the product. As I was walking past them, and they had displayed one of their clients, and so I just looked them up and gave them a call and I was like, "Oh, I guess this is how it works." I felt confident in speaking with them.

## Client
That's great. As far as what kind of workflows they're handling for you now, you said mostly scheduling, are there any kinds of other workflows they're doing for you?

## Expert
No, not right now, but we're looking at new patient referrals with them. That would be the next step. At this

## Conversation Transcript

**Client:**
Got it. How deeply are they integrated into your systems? It sounds like they have a great athena integration. Are there any other systems they're integrated into?

**Expert:**
No. Right now, they're only integrated into athena, and that's where they need to be. It doesn't need integration into our EMR product, plus our EMR product is very hard to integrate into. There's still.

**Client:**
Which EMR do you guys use?

**Expert:**
IntelleChartPRO with Nextech. It's also known as MDI as well too.

**Client:**
Got it. Is that an on-premise solution or cloud-based?

**Expert:**
That is a cloud-based solution.

**Client:**
Sounds good. When they're taking a call and booking an appointment, that is getting written to your clinic's calendar via athena?

**Expert:**
Yes.

**Client:**
Got it. What percent of calls that they end up starting are actually being finished by the AI versus, say, human asking for a representative and then getting transferred out?

**Expert:**
A significant portion are going through Assort. Sometimes they might get transferred out, which is an option with the nodes. Very rare, but it does happen.

**Client:**
Got it. I think we're relieving office. You said majority of the calls that they start, they're being finished. I don't know if you have any metrics, but it'd be helpful just get a range of like 70% of calls, 80% of calls, or if you don't have it, it's all right.

**Expert:**
It's probably closer to 90% of calls. 90%-95% of calls are getting answered and completed through Assort. Maybe even more than.

## Client
Nice. What do you all use for your telephony system internally? Do you have a VoIP provider? Do you use an old school landline?

## Expert
We use Voice over IP from Nextiva as our Voice over IP provider.

## Client
Got it. You mentioned that you set up a call center of three folks, and then you implemented Assort, how did you end up managing the call center afterwards? Were you able to reduce headcount or did you scale just using Assort?

## Expert
Actually, it provided us an opportunity to reevaluate some of our relationships with other vendors as well too because what ended up happening is our call center staff were like, "Uh oh, are we going to be out of a job because we're not answering as many phone calls?"

We saw an opportunity where we were paying another vendor money to outsource our patient-financial-assistance program because we just didn't have the staff to do that. We were like, "Hey, actually we can reassign these 1/2 of those call center members and 1/3 clinical staff member from another group into our patient-financial-assistance group, and we no longer need to utilize this other vendor."

That ended up saving us six-figures a year. We're still paying the pay for these same people, we're doing content. We just moved the staff over to this new role, which now also allows us to expand what that role is as well too. That was pretty exciting.

I think as we look at building out more of its functionality, the real main goal is to try to alleviate some of the administrative burdens on our existing staff. We run a pretty lean company. My goal is to always help empower our staff to be more efficient and effective with doing less burdensome work and focusing more on high-level work, and trying to get the right tools to take care of the rest.

## Client
That's great. We're doing a lot of research on the space, and our belief is voice AI in general, is a lever to actually, ironically, make healthcare more human, where you use AI to increase operational efficiency for simple tasks like scheduling. You can use humans to do things that are more important and refocus on things that really matter with patients.

## Expert
Exactly.

## Client
Cool. I appreciate this background so far. You mentioned your spend with this platform in the screening questions. Curious, how does that spend typically break down within the platform?

## Expert
It's just a flat fee per month that we pay. As I negotiate with Assort and we utilize other AI tools in a variety of other ways as well too. Going back to when I was looking at how to improve our call center, I was like, either I have to add more people or add the right tools.

I was looking at it as I was like, "I'm probably going to need to bring on maybe two, maybe three people." That would've been thousands more per month, or maybe let's see what Assort can do. I was like, "Assort, I'm willing to pay you X a month because that's the equivalent of one person in this role, and we'll see how that goes." That's my contract with them is X a month for up to 13,000 calls for Assort to handle by itself. Right now, it's only doing like 4,500. That's a way to go.

## Client
You have a lot of room left. Is there any pricing that happens if you go over 13,000?

## Expert
Yeah. After 13,000, I think it's under $1 a call or extra or something. I told them we could also renegotiate at that price at that time, if it's significantly more than 13,000 calls.

## Client
Makes sense. Did they have any implementation fee?

## Expert
No, they did not. They waited for us because we were their first.

## Client
Got it. You mentioned you're using other AI platforms within your group. Are there any, that you find, particularly successful?

## Expert
Yeah, really impressed. We developed an audit, internal audit team. Since we see so many patients, it breaks down to about 3,500 charts a month. We have two folks, and two people aren't going to be able to read 3,500 charts a month. We worked with and developed an AI tool to read our charting, our documentation, and give us a green light, red light on our coding based off of that documentation to make sure our CPT coding supported by the documentation, and if not, to highlight those.

We've been working with the company on just understanding more ophthalmology-specific and retina-specific rules around coding, and how that might apply in documentation, and how that might apply to more general coding rules. So far, we're in month two of our testing and building, but it's been working really well in being able to help our two staff members go through and identify the charts they need to focus on more so than the charts they don't need to. That's one, this company called Sintra.

## DO NOT COPY
sd@virtuevc.com

The other one is just started working with the Stealth AI group to look at how we can further automate our eligibility and authorizations with AI. We have some complexity that other AI tools in the space really haven't been able to address, namely, like I was saying, being able to connect an AI tool to Nextech and IntelleChartPRO and MDI is very difficult. This is one of the first Stealth groups that I came across.

I gave them access, and they were able to accurately read the chart as well as for some of our major payers. Right now, it's only been two weeks, but they've been pretty successful in at least getting the eligibility verification just as one of our staff members would.

Although we have automated eligibility through athena and we also use Phreesia, one of the things that helps us maintain a really low denial rate due to not having the proper eligibility and authorizations as we take extra steps in the beginning of the month to reverify all of our patients coming in their eligibility and also how we get authorizations.

As an example, in the past three years, out of the 18,400+ claims related to drug usage, we've only had, on average, about 15 denials before not having an authorization and less than five denials for not having proper eligibility. We get paid about 99% of our drug claims because of all these processes we have in place. We work really hard to get it. That's why I'm hoping these tools that we're implementing now can help us continue to achieve those really strong KPIs but with less work.

## Client
Very cool. With Sintra and the chart reviews, what is the outcome of their product? Are you being able to resolve more claims as a result? Curious how they integrate.

# Document Content

The goal of Sintra is we want to continue to improve. What we're finding is a lot of our insurances are starting to request medical documentation, especially when it comes to the times that we code for an exam along with the patient's visit. This is when we're coding like 99212, 99213, 99214. Admittedly, our documentation isn't always the best. A lot of times it's more like, "I thought it in my head, but didn't write it down."

What we were noticing is more of our denials that we have to work on the back end were for these E&#x26;M codes. We would review the charts that we were about to submit and like, "This might not work well." We would include a letter explaining our documentation. In the most part, it would be successful, but it's a lot of work that we have to do to get that $100. That's what we're hoping with Sintra.

So far, we've been impressed with it being able to identify within our documentation where opportunities for us to improve. We're able to at least make sure our charts have that documentation before it even needs to be sent out. We expect us to have to send those charts out, but now at least we can go with more confidence that "Okay, at least we got the documentation done well in the beginning, so we don't have to write an explanation or be worried about it later when we know we'll have to send the chart in at some point."

**Client**
Got it. For their pricing model, is it success-based or are they charging per use?

**Expert**
Per use. For example, they capture the 3,000, even though they're doing more than 3,000 charts.

**Client**
Got it. Not success-based. I really appreciate it. Have a great rest of your day.
