## Slide 4: Problem - Practices are getting squeezed from both sides.

**PROBLEM**

### Practices are getting squeezed from both sides, and it's only getting worse.

---

**As costs increases...**
*   Rising operational costs
*   Administrative inefficiencies from scheduling to billing
*   Increased temporary worker expenses

→

**Revenues decrease**
*   Medicare reimbursement cuts
*   Expiration of payment incentives (e.g., 3.5% APM bonus)

## Slide 5: The Impossible Choice

**THE IMPOSSIBLE CHOICE**

### Today, practices under financial strain are forced to make a lose-lose choice.

#### Struggle Alone
*   X Overworked but underpaid
*   X Drowning in administrative tasks
*   X Constantly fighting declining margins

#### Surrender to Private Equity
*   X Loss of autonomy
*   X Revenue siphoned to overhead and PE owners
*   X Junior staff paid a fraction of billings
