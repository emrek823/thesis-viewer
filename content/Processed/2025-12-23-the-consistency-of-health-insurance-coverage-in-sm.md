A figure with two panels showing the percentage of small businesses that discontinued health insurance from one year to the next during the pre-pandemic period from 2018 to 2019. Each panel features a bar chart. The left panel represents nonemployer firms, and the right panel represents employer firms. For nonemployer firms, approximately 32 percent discontinued health insurance, with the highest shares in restaurants at 38 percent, personal services at 38 percent, and repair and maintenance at 37 percent. For employer firms, about 31 percent discontinued health insurance, with the highest shares in restaurants at 36 percent, repair and maintenance at 35 percent, and construction at 34 percent. Other reasons for firms exiting the sample included becoming inactive or closing their accounts, but these were less common compared to discontinuing health insurance payments.
