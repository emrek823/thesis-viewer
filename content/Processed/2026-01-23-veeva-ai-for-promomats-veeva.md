## Veeva AI for PromoMats

# Fastest Path to Approved Content with AI

Veeva AI for PromoMats enhances how life sciences teams review and approve content by combining human expertise with AI precision to strengthen compliance, accelerate speed to market, and increase productivity.

Built natively into the Vault Platform, Veeva AI for PromoMats utilizes two standard agents. The Quick Check Agent scans content using editorial, brand, market, channel, and compliance guidelines to address issues before medical, legal, regulatory (MLR) review. The Content Agent provides context-aware insights into document text and images, answers questions, summarizes content, analyzes visuals, and draws from Quick Check Agent to assist with document review. This ensures higher-quality, compliant content—delivered faster and with greater confidence.

With your content and data staying securely inside Vault, Veeva AI for PromoMats provides a seamless, compliant experience that scales with your organization. These agents are the initial focus where we will continue to build purpose built agents to modernize the MLR process and unlock new levels of efficiency.

**Available Standard Agents:** Quick Check Agent and Content Agent
