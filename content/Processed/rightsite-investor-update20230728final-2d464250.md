## Slide 2: Company Update - Highlights

RIGHT SI+E

### Health Plan Sales
*   We have engaged 38 plans in a sales process, up from 8 in Q4:22.
*   We have signed: 1 FFS + Case Rate contract; 4 FFS contracts signed, one with a Case Rate being negotiated; and 7 FFS + Case Rates in negotiation.
*   Adding a case rate option will expedite contracting for plans who evaluate VBC deals with separate teams. Case rates should be similar to VBC rates or have a contractual ability to change the rate once the plan has more experience and is more comfortable in a gain-share-like format.
*   Negotiating FFS contracts at standard rates has run smoothly for the most part.

### EMS/Fire Implementation and Expansion
*   We continue to experience word-of-mouth expansion in Georgia, with strong and consistent demand for EMS management ("choosers").
*   Grady is pulling us into new parts of the organization (nurse call line, dispatch, etc) with enthusiasm for our model.
*   Change management at the EMS Crew level ("users") is not moving as fast as we want. EMS Management and RightSite can point to the potential volume, but the change management process has not been executed crisply on our end (see slide 9). While we have conviction this is solvable, we have work to do to hit our Q3 goal of moving from a current average of 6 calls/day to our Q3 goal of 20 calls/day.
*   Implementations of incremental EMS agencies in Atlanta have been smooth.
*   Jacksonville Fire and Rescue is trained and ready. The Go-live date is to be determined by City Manager, hopefully in a meeting on 7/27.

### Operations
*   Last meeting, we discussed two potential failure points we are watching closely: EMS implementations and delivering excellent navigation services. Over the past few months, these processes have continued to harden, and while we won't take our eye off them, they are stable and ready to absorb volume.
*   The RightSite Connect platform is on a rapid iterative cycle of engineering. The platform is stable and effective (as a reminder, the platform is similar to one this same team built at TAVHealth).
*   We should be submitting our first FFS telehealth claims in the next week, a marker of progress for building the infrastructure needed to create and submit claims.

### Challenges
*   Better execution of change management strategies for EMS call rate.
*   Demonstrating the case rate positioning will accelerate the contracting process with plans
*   Product Management and Marketing activity is thin but typical for a company at our stage.
*   Keeping a careful eye on the burn rate as we approach the go/no go marker around Labor Day for launching Series A.

## Slide 3: Company Update - Q3 Priorities

RIGHT SI+E

These are the Q3 priorities set by management, and cascaded to each employee with role-specific goals.

| Priority for Q3:23                                                    | Status                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| :-------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1) Increase EMS call volume to 20 calls/day**                       | We plan to increase calls by ½ every month, starting at a base of 6 calls/day (weekly average) in the Atlanta area. That means we end July at a “run rate” of around 9/day, end August around 13/day, and end September around 20/day. We have many new change management tactics focused on Grady EMS. Front-line EMS adoption remains a stubborn puzzle with slower progress than we expected. Our review of what and how we've implemented change management experiments has not been as crisp as we thought - and we're taking direct action on that front. |
| **2) Execute Case Rate / VBC contracts/Flat Rate Contracts ≥ 6, with 4 in Georgia.** | The payor sales cycle remains strong, given that we have been at it for only seven months. We have signed: 1 FFS + Case Rate contract; 4 FFS contracts signed, one with a Case Rate being negotiated; and 7 FFS + Case Rates in negotiation. <br> With our new strategy of case rate vs. VBC arrangement to shorten the negotiation, I'm encouraged we'll hit this goal in Q3.                                         |
| **3) MSO and Revenue Cycle are operational and able to scale**        | We will be submitting our first FFS claim within the next week. <br> The basic revenue cycle and credentialing systems are in place, and Q3 will focus on hardening the process in anticipation of volume.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **4) Prepare RightSite for Series A funding**                         | Building the Call Unit Cost model was an essential first step. Now we'll focus on a more robust model, including projections, associated capital requirements, and a draft investor deck.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

1.  Est. for non-recurring expense Aug-23 incl. second/final payment to Strata Decision Technology ($32K)+placeholder for new office move ($50K)
2.  Includes i) quarterly + annual costs adjusted for months and ii) interest income

### MD&A – Burn

The estimated monthly steady state burn of $393K increased by $31K due to:
1.  New FTE - Director of Reporting
2.  Part time physician transitioning to full time schedule
3.  Increased training for navigation team
4.  Mitigants include reduced spend for legal advisory services, office build-out, and accounting advisory services

### MD&A – Month-to-Month Variance
1.  The increase in Professional Fees was due to catch-up payments ($28K) to Greenberg Traurig related to regulatory/compliance and RightSite Foundation set-up work
2.  The increase in Other Operating spend includes quarterly payments to ClosedLoop ($16K), RSH's actuarial team and HITRUST data host. Other payments included ClosedLoop ($21K), and 1/2 payments to Strata Technology ($32K) for a one-time hospital-based cost analysis of avoidable ED visits
3.  Non-recurring continues to tail off; uses include finalizing GAAP transition, and the office build-out
4.  Based on an estimate of the current burn and adjusted cash balance at EOP Jul-23, RightSite projects ~ 8 months of cash runway assuming zero revenue

## Slide 8: Sales - Payors

RIGHT SI+E

### What Happened
*   **Contract status**
    *   1 FFS + Case Rate executed - Aetna Better Health (ABH-TX)
    *   3 FFS executed with Case Rate in process - Centene-GA (PeachState and WellCare), Amerigroup-TX. 1 Additional signed FFS with Aetna - GA (MA and Commercial)
    *   7 FFS + Case Rate in negotiation - Humana GA, Florida Blue and Centene plans (WellCare, Sunshine and Superior) The additional Centene plans in FL and TX being negotiated as a multi state deal with GA.
*   Full pipeline in sales process on page 9
*   Health plans appear more open to a case rate than a shared savings contract.
*   Created new Pay-for-Performance Case Rate methodology that includes a program evaluation at the end of year one. See Appendix.
*   Aetna Better Health VA - interested in implementing soon (200k+ lives)
*   **Strategy meetings with sales consultants Murnane and Muchniki ("M&M") are bearing fruit and getting us to the decision makers**
    *   Humana GA - regional plan president
    *   Centene - ability to negotiate a three state deal
    *   Anthem - GA - getting to right stakeholder
*   CareSource completed their data analysis - combined meeting with Closed Loop scheduled to better understand their findings. We think they are not including in-patient and observation stays (same story as Humana when we helped them adjust their analysis)
*   Cigna continued active interest in the Proactive Outreach Service
*   **Texas**
    *   Kick off Meeting with Aetna Better Health of Texas held
    *   Early progress with EMS in San Antonio and Dallas/Fort Worth area

### What's Next
*   Q3 Goal is to close >= 6 VBC/Case Rate Contracts with 4 in GA, so we are prioritizing closing GA plans
*   Complete contracting process with Centene, Humana and Florida Blue
*   Introduction of case rate strategy to current pipeline
*   CareSource/Closed Loop meeting regarding cost analysis of their claims data utilizing RightSite methodology
*   Proactive Outreach Services, finalize product/process definition and pricing of this service
*   We are in the early stage of determining if we have an opportunity to take over Ready Responder's footprint in Las Vegas and Reno
*   Complete data analysis with Meritain (Aetna owned TPA for self insured groups ) for four commercial clients in Jacksonville, FL
*   BayCare negotiations continue - Tampa. Next presentation early Aug
*   Aetna Better Health FL interested when we enter Tampa
*   Emcara implementation dependency on Florida Blue contract

### Challenges
*   Payor sense of urgency
*   Serious inquiries/interest outside of initial targeted GA, FL, TX markets - VA likely to push in late 3rd/4th quarter
*   Health plans' belief in their managed care processes mitigate IP and OBS stay for avoidable ED visits (they don't)
*   While we continue to find new ways into United, traction remains a challenge

## Slide 11: Sales - MLR Savings Slide for Plans 1/2

RIGHT SI+E
For non-emergency patients

This second page lists the value and services delivered by RightSite to the plan. The goal is to convey overall value delivered and also provide a counter to the "free rider" position some payors may take in a negotiation with us upon learning that our EMS strategy is to take all calls regardless of insurance coverage.

### + Benefits of Partnering with RightSite

### RightSite Services to Humana

#### MLR Savings
*   Avoidance of an unnecessary emergency room visit (and possibly Observation or Inpatient Stay)
*   Identification and mitigation of frequent users of the ER
*   Reduction in ambulance transport cost

#### Reporting
*   ICD-10 Z codes included in telehealth claims.
*   Reporting of member experience and outcomes - feeding into HEDIS and other quality measures

#### Health Plan Support
*   Referral of health plan members to attributed PCP/Group Providers
*   Real-time coordination with Health Plan's Case Management, i.e., member in route to ER
*   Location and updated contact information of hard-to-find members.
*   Health Plan contribution in community to improve 911 response times for everyone.
*   Identification and contact information of care givers

#### Member Satisfaction
*   Next-day follow-up outreach to member, whether they went to the ER or chose an alternate health care experience.
*   Prescription Assistance - positive impact on Part D of patient satisfaction scores
*   Reduce member abrasion - surprise bills and negative care experience with long wait times.

#### Member Support/Assistance
*   On-Demand Transport to ER alternative destination, if needed
*   Education and Referral to health plans benefits/programs such as mail order prescription refills, scheduled transportation to PCP visits, chronic condition programs, etc.

## Slide 12: Sales - Government Relations

RIGHT SI+E

### What Happened
*   Ted Koutsoubas, Advisory Board and GR SME – weekly internal meetings
*   Medicaid Health Plans of America (MHPA) Advocacy Leadership Forum–Signed up for Sponsorship for the Annual October meeting in DC. Jamo, Michael and Cindy will be attending. Ted will be helping coordinate meetings as it gets closer.
*   National Association of Medicaid Directors (NAMD) – will be a sponsor at the October annual meeting with 300 attendees, including Payors. Jamo, Michael and Cindy will be attending.

### What's Next
*   Florida Partners – good conversation with FL ACHA President, who suggests we get a FFS Pilot. When the State does a Pilot, payors tend to flock to what the State is evaluating. We are having an early conversation about JAX being that Pilot location.
*   We are pivoting to Institute for Medicaid Innovation as a potential partner for Medicaid data, which is notoriously difficult to get (there are no national databases of Medicaid claims data, and states seldom publish de-identified claim data like CMS does.)

### Challenges
*   Many conversations in various stages and need to be focused and targeted toward tangible outcomes
*   Our GR efforts are budgeted for, but will be a thoughtful approach and be a significant accelerator in our plan sales - likely spend this year will be about $50K
*   Takes time

## Slide 13: Sales - EMS

RIGHT SI+E

### What Happened

#### Georgia
*   **Atlanta Area**
    *   Closed & Implemented City of Morrow Fire Dept (transporting service)
    *   Active sales process with Douglas County EMS (transporting), Alpharetta Fire, Clayton County Fire (transporting), Marietta Fire, Dekalb Fire Rescue and Gwinnett County Fire (largest EMS volume in Atlanta Metro)
*   **Greater GA**
    *   Chatham Emergency Services (transporting service outside of Savannah)
    *   Successful speaking spot at GA state Mobile Integrated Health/Community Paramedicine
    *   Strong interest in our service in rural GA

#### Florida
*   We have a pipeline of EMS agencies in Northeastern Florida but have withheld activity pending the formal launch of Jacksonville Fire and Rescue

#### Texas
*   San Antonio Fire Dept is in an active sales process. We hope to add D/FW EMS agencies soon. Both locations have Aetna and Amerigroup membership.

#### Arizona
*   Mesa Fire engaged and evaluating in partnership with Humana

### What's Next

#### Georgia Expansion
*   Grady EMS start taking calls from dispatch & expansion outside of the Atlanta Area
*   Close/activate Douglas County EMS, Alpharetta Fire, Clayton County Fire, Marietta Fire, Dekalb Fire Rescue, and Gwinnett County Fire (largest EMS volume in Atlanta Metro)

#### Florida Expansion
*   Began planning NE and central FL expansion

#### Texas
*   Sales process to close/activate San Antonio EMS and hopefully others in DFW like MedStar EMS (high volume)

#### Arizona & Nevada to support Health Plan Opportunities
*   Advance sales process for Mesa, AZ with Humana
*   Explore Nevada Opportunities from Ready Responders

### Challenges
*   We are behind in our Texas EMS partner development despite having signed contracts with Texas plans. We have recently gained new traction as we spend more time on Texas EMS

## Slide 14: Sales - Hospitals

RIGHT SI+E

We are exploring a partnership with BayCare in Tampa, where we approach Tampa-area health plans together.

The upside for RightSite is possibly accelerating payor contracting. The upside for Baycare is adding to ambulatory volume with RightSite ER diversions, a strategic initiative for their new CEO. Baycare also likes the idea of grabbing volume upstream of HCA's emergency rooms. They also have an MA plan that would enroll in the RightSite program.

The next meeting with their management team is on August 15th.

## Slide 15: Marketing

RIGHT SI+E

### What Happened
*   New website in final stages
*   Continued to update sales, marketing, training and implementation collateral - including leaderboards and weekly case studies
*   Created backlog of blog content in anticipation of social media launch
*   Released first video co-produced with Cobb Fire - you can see the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fj-v5H0n_4Y), which was released to 800 Cobb Firefighters week of 7/17 -
*   Social media presence and content launching in June

### What's Next
*   Launch updated website and social media

### Challenges
Controlling the trade-off marketing decisions between what is desirable and achievable given our limited cycles, budget and no formal lead for marketing needs.

## Slide 16: Operations - Georgia

RIGHT SI+E

### What Happened

#### Implementations
*   Continued expansion into South Fulton (southern Atlanta MSA) through our warm partnership with Grady EMS with a go-live in the City of Morrow (transporting Fire Department)
*   First light-touch EMS partner implementation (City of Morrow FD)
*   WellStreet UCC in Atlanta live
*   Refining implementation learnings in Atlanta for use in Jacksonville and other future implementations

#### EMS Account Management
*   Launched "EMS clinical liaison” to experiment with EMS training and engagement. Think of a “cath lab rep” who used to work in a cath lab. This is a firefighter / paramedic training/selling firefighters and paramedics.
*   Refining EMS implementation and post-go-live account management plan, including critical change management process for front-line EMS adoption; EMS Leadership is actively engaged and willing to partner to drive change.
*   Consistent delivery of EMS partner performance reporting & materials to help drive EMS front-line adoption & accountability
*   We presented at the GA Community Paramedicine/Mobile Integrated Healthcare Symposium and received numerous leads from attendees across Georgia. Our lunch and learn presentation had the highest level of engagement among all presenters for the day

### What's Next

#### Implementations
*   Driving to 20 calls/day out of Atlanta by the end of Q3.
*   Add 2+ EMS partners to Atlanta MSA by the end of the quarter
*   GA expansion outside of Atlanta MSA

#### Extending relationship with Grady Hospital
*   Opportunity to take calls directly from their 911 dispatch & 911 nurse line in Q3, which could bypass the EMS engagement challenge
*   Expansion double avg daily call volume over the next 60 days
*   Access to additional data enabling precision in change management execution

### Challenges
*   Change management strategies for EMS engagement continue to be a learning curve. Making progress is about focusing on the 'users,' not the. 'choosers' - who show strong support and cooperation

## Slide 17: Operations - Florida

RIGHT SI+E

### What Happened

#### Implementations
*   Beta training for 2 stations in JAX completed (June 26-28)
*   Refining implementation learnings in Atlanta for use in Jacksonville, foreshadowing a scalable approach to multiple communities

#### EMS Account Management
*   Not Started

### What's Next

#### Implementations
*   Jacksonville Fire & Rescue activation
    *   Meeting with Chief Administrative Officer on July 27: We may receive a green light to go live with 2 stations
*   Emcara Health (3 counties around Jacksonville with 659 enrolled members). Emcara is a full-risk delegated provider wholly-owned by Florida Blue.
*   FL expansion with additional stations
*   Contracting with Florida Blue

### Challenges
*   JAX political situation at the mayor's office (new mayor and administrative staff) is creating a delay in JFRD activation

## Slide 18: Navigation

RIGHT SI+E

### What Happened
*   Consistent higher volume has continued to test and iterate our navigation processes and efficiency. Team collaboration and culture are strong.
*   We onboarded two additional Navigators on June 19th. Training is effective enough now to have them take their first calls in 8 days. The total navigator count is now 9.

### What's Next
*   We are working on a more tightly integrated, team-based relationship between navigators and physicians, including developing formal squads of 7 navigators and 1 physician. This squad structure allows for more expertise in given service areas and smoother and faster scaling of future squads. The idea is that new squads are created with 4-5 recruits who join two seasoned navigators - this allows the culture and know-how to spread quicker among new teams.
*   Expansion is still on the horizon with the anticipation of extended hours and days. While the date to offer this expansion has yet to be decided, the work to prepare is complete. We are ready to hire and train more Navigators to accommodate the growth as soon as we're prepared to move forward.
*   New scheduling tool demos are scheduled, and a new scheduling platform will be implemented by the end of Q3.
*   Identify more opportunities to offer continuing education to the navigation team, including insurance, motivational interviewing, worker's comp, SDoH identification, solutions, etc.
*   Team Building fun will be scheduled offsite for the Navigators to continue to build relationships and bonds within their squad.

### Challenges
*   Call center-like environments are challenging to manage, as expected.
*   The new RightSite Connect platform has some limitations due to its early lifecycle stage, which creates post-call productivity delays. Engineering continues to improve the product based on our feedback.
*   Our current space is out of compliance with our lease requirements, and we may have to move prematurely (HVAC and elevator issues, among others).
*   After implementation, we implemented Sling's scheduling tool but found out that it does not account for differential pay across shifts. We'll have to find another solution.

## Slide 19: Engineering

RIGHT SI+E

### What Happened
*   Significant updates to the intake workflow to allow navigation based on the patient's response to the physician's recommendation
*   Improved navigator control over episode outcomes
*   Implemented a contact identification mechanism to help prevent creation of duplicates
*   Improved control telehealth component of intake workflow
*   Implemented a feature flag mechanism to increase speed at which features can be evaluated and released
*   Improved product management processes and increased awareness across the organization
*   Integration with AdvancedMD for patient demographics

### What's Next
*   Integrated eligibility checks with pVerify as part of the intake workflow
*   Start design and implementation of SDOH and related capabilities
*   Deeper integration with AdvancedMD to support revenue cycle process
*   Improved usability and capability for managing EMS episodes after completing the intake process
*   Support for Follow-Up episodes and related capabilities
*   Support for multiple physician recommendations (e.g., primary and secondary) during the intake process

### Challenges
*   Occasional poor connectivity on inbound EMS calls creates challenges for navigators, need better system support
*   Some challenges getting the organization to agree on product priorities and timeframes
*   Limited engineering resources require thoughtful and critical analysis of priorities

*   Dr. Derrick Ashong is our third physician and is fully onboarded and taking calls in a part-time schedule; he is published in SDOH in Emergency Medicine literature

### What's Next
*   Deeper integration with AdvancedMD to support revenue cycle process, including insurance verification and patient coding
*   Revenue cycle platform build for existing contracts in negotiation + FFS
*   Figure out how to create invoicing for case-rate / value-based eligible episodes in AMD
*   Dr. Joe Leong is moving to a full-time schedule to take calls three days per week in 12-hour shifts and will be assuming the Medical Direction role for the growing Physician Practice
*   The Physician and Navigation team will reorganize into an integrated health team to improve interoperability and assure the highest quality of clinical and SDOH outcomes

### Challenges
*   Physician/entity credentialing and licensing administration is challenging to set, establish, and administer at scale
*   Lack of urgency for state departments that govern medical licensing and Medicaid licensure
*   Some states, like Florida, require physical practice sites within the state, even for telehealth providers
