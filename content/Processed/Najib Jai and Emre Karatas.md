### Conduce Health Exit Strategy

- Big inflection point year - Q3 decision window
- Two paths forward:
	- March ahead for Series A by Q2 2026
	- Pursue soft landing/acquisition
- Current trajectory: ~$2.5M ARR by Q2 2026 (insufficient for market conditions)
	- VBC company comparison: $17M ARR struggling to raise Series A
- Nearing deal conversion with Northeast hospital system LOI

### Company Pivot and Market Position

- Shifted focus from at-risk primary care to hospital systems
- Technology remains same: patient cohorting, predictive models, specialist matching
- Hospital system constraints: specialists must be in-network
- Value proposition evolution:
	- Prevent patient leakage
	- Bolster revenue for health systems
	- Clear, clean value prop opportunities

### Acquisition Process Update

- Initiated after July board meeting due to fiduciary responsibility
- Two suitor categories:
	- Deep healthcare analytics companies (want tech stack)
	- Value-based care companies (more traction here)
- Currently finalizing one deal, potentially two suitors
- Team placement secured across opportunities

### Najib’s Next Chapter Plans

- Starting another company (not immediately)
- Two current exploration tracks:
	- Fractional support for compelling healthcare startups
	- Full-time roles (2-3 year commitment)
- Criteria for full-time opportunities:
	- Technical innovation focus
	- Meaningful healthcare impact
- Interested in AI infrastructure companies like Protégé (marketplace for AI model data layers)

### Next Steps

- Najib requested introductions to interesting technical healthcare companies
- Emre to share contacts for:
	- Med PI (healthcare benchmarking)
	- Dart Health AI (clinical record analysis)
	- Standard Model Bio (multimodal foundation models)
- Both to connect via text for ongoing collaboration
- Plan to meet at PRAC Summit in September
