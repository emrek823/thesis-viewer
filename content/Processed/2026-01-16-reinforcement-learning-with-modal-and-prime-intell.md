About Event

​Reinforcement Learning is a hot topic, but how is RL being used in the real world?

​​Join **[Modal](https://modal.com/)** **and** **[Prime Intellect](https://www.primeintellect.ai/)** in an evening for engineers and researchers working with RL. Our speakers will cover:

* ​**The RL Landscape**— how engineers evaluate frameworks, model size and architecture, reward functions and more?
* ​**Environments** — how do RL environments integrate evals, synthetic data and agent development?
* ​​**From 0 to 100B+** — how do you implement RL at scale and what are the challenges to anticipate?

​With:

* ​**[Peyton Walters](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pawalt/)****,** Technical Staff at Modal
* ​**[Will Brown,](https://www.linkedin.com/in/willcb/)**Research Lead at Prime Intellect
