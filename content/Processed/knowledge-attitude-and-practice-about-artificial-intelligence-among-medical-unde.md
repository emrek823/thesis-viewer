Abstract

Background

Methods

A cross-sectional study was conducted at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Nagpur, among undergraduate (MBBS) and postgraduate (MD/MS) students, with a total of 317 students. A structured, pre-validated questionnaire was administered using a hard copy. The survey comprised four sections: demographic details, knowledge, attitude, and practice.

Results

Conclusion

Medical students have moderate knowledge of AI and positive attitudes toward its use in healthcare, but actual use is low due to limited training, concerns about accuracy, and lack of integration, highlighting the need for focused education and practical exposure to AI tools in medical training.

Introduction

Despite this growing integration of AI in clinical practice, its incorporation into medical education remains inconsistent. Medical students and trainees, who represent the future healthcare workforce, must be adequately prepared to engage with AI-driven tools. However, there is limited empirical evidence on their knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) related to AI, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Hence, this study is planned to address this gap by assessing the KAP regarding AI among undergraduate and postgraduate medical students in a tertiary care teaching hospital.

Materials & Methods

Study design and setting

This was a cross-sectional, questionnaire-based study conducted by the Department of Pharmacology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Nagpur. The study targeted undergraduate (MBBS) students from the second phase onwards and postgraduate (MD/MS) students from all professional years, conducted over a four-month period, from December 2024 to April 2025. Convenience sampling was employed, where all eligible participants present during the data collection period were invited to participate. Participation was voluntary. Students who provided informed consent and submitted complete responses were included in the study.

Ethical considerations

The study was initiated after receiving clearance from the Institutional Ethics Committee of AIIMS, Nagpur (IEC/Pharmac/2024/1030). Administrative clearance was also secured from the institutional leadership. The protocol adhered to the ethical principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. Confidentiality was ensured throughout the data collection and analysis process.

Data collection processes

Participants were briefed about the purpose and scope of the study and administered a structured, pre-validated questionnaire [3] in hard-copy format. The questionnaire comprised four sections: demographic details, knowledge related to AI, attitudes towards AI in medicine, and self-reported practices regarding AI use. A time frame of 15 minutes was allotted for the questionnaire, completion under supervision by the investigator to ensure independent responses.

Structure of the questionnaire

The question included the following sections.

Demographic Details

This section comprises participants' initial, age, sex (male/female), educational level (UG/PG), graduation year (1st/2nd/3rd), and specialty.

Knowledge

Seven items assessed knowledge about AI as dichotomous (yes/no) responses, and two open-ended questions assessed the applications and barriers.

Attitude

Practice

Sample size calculation

Convenience sampling was done in the present study [9]. Assuming that 71% [3] of the subjects in the population have the factor of interest, the study would require a minimum sample size of 317 for estimating the expected proportion with 5% absolute precision and 95% confidence.

Data analysis

Quantitative variables were summarized using means and standard deviations, while categorical variables were presented as frequencies and percentages. Associations between selected categorical variables were assessed using the Chi-square test. Data entry and analysis were performed using Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, US).

Results

A total of 450 hard-copy questionnaires were distributed to students, of which 317 (70.4%) completed questionnaires were returned and included in the analysis. Among the respondents, 188 (59.3%) were undergraduates and 129 (40.7%) were postgraduates, representing 27 medical specialties. The highest proportion of postgraduate participants was from general medicine and obstetrics and gynecology. The mean age of the participants was 22.7±3.7 years. Gender information was provided by 315 respondents, of whom 186 (58.7%) were male, and 131 (41.3%) were female.

Knowledge

Most participants, 239 of 317 (75.4%), reported having basic knowledge of artificial intelligence. Only 83 of 316 (26.3%) indicated they knew what deep learning or machine learning is. A little over half, 172 of 310 (55.5%), said they knew at least one application of AI in their field. Formal instruction and training were uncommon: 31 of 317 (9.8%) had attended any AI course, and 38 of 317 (12%) had been taught about AI during undergraduate studies. Two-thirds, 202 of 306 (66%), agreed that AI requires a lot of labelled data to learn. Less than half, 139 of 307 (45.3%), reported that they understood the barriers to applying AI in medicine.

Table 1: Knowledge of artificial intelligence among healthcare students

Only one item showed a statistically significant difference between males and females. Knowledge of machine learning/deep learning was higher among males (31.15%) compared with females (19.85%), with a statistically significant difference (p=0.025). To explore differences in AI-related awareness and exposure across educational levels, responses were compared between undergraduate (UG) and postgraduate (PG) students (see Table 2).

Attitude

Students were broadly positive about learning AI and about its ethical implications. For the statement that healthcare students should learn the basics of AI, 281 of 316 respondents (88.9%) either agreed or strongly agreed, 25 (7.9%) were neutral, and 10 (3.2%) disagreed or strongly disagreed. For the view that AI will be a highly required tool in their field, 244 of 315 (77.5%) agreed or strongly agreed, 51 (16.2%) were neutral, and 20 (6.3%) disagreed or strongly disagreed. For the need to understand ethical implications, 291 of 316 (92.1%) agreed or strongly agreed, 18 (5.7%) were neutral, and 7 (2.2%) disagreed or strongly disagreed.

A majority also agreed that AI will change the educational system: 249 of 317 (78.5%) agreed or strongly agreed, 58 (18.3%) were neutral, and 10 (3.2%) disagreed or strongly disagreed. However, only 52 of 316 (16.5%) agreed or strongly agreed that human teachers will be replaced in the foreseeable future; 76 (24.1%) were neutral, and 188 (59.5%) disagreed or strongly disagreed. Regarding excitement about upcoming educational developments, 223 of 317 (70.3%) agreed or strongly agreed, 79 (24.9%) were neutral, and 15 (4.7%) disagreed or strongly disagreed.

Most participants supported including AI in medical training: 256 of 316 (81.0%) agreed or strongly agreed, 46 (14.6%) were neutral, and 14 (4.4%) disagreed or strongly disagreed. Only 33 of 317 (10.4%) agreed or strongly agreed that clinical AI will be more accurate than physicians; 85 (26.8%) were neutral, and 199 (62.8%) disagreed or strongly disagreed. On whether some specialties are more prone to being replaced by AI than others, 180 of 315 (57.0%) agreed or strongly agreed, 79 (25.0%) were neutral, and 57 (18.0%) disagreed or strongly disagreed. Finally, 89 of 316 (28.2%) agreed or strongly agreed that AI would increase diagnostic errors, 122 (38.6%) were neutral, and 105 (33.2%) disagreed or strongly disagreed.

Two items showed statistically significant gender differences. A higher proportion of females agreed that healthcare students should learn the basics of AI (p=0.044). Females also expressed stronger agreement that the ethical implications of AI must be understood by students (p=0.017). The differences in AI-related attitude across educational levels, responses were compared between undergraduate and postgraduate students (see Table 4).
