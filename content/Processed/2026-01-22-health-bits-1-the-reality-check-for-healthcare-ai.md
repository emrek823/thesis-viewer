Welcome to the first edition of *Health Bits*! I’ve been meaning to write this for a while. A simple space to share what I’m reading, thinking about, and learning as I spend more time deep in the healthtech and bio space.

This will be a monthly and personal note, focused on ideas, relevant content, and few things that made me stop and think.

Let’s start with a summary of my latest piece for GoHub Ventures’ blog ⤵

## Where Do We Stand in the Healthcare AI Race

Healthcare AI adoption has reached a turning point. The conversation has moved beyond excitement and technical possibility into a much more demanding phase, where **deployment, governance, and execution define success**.

Friction and reckoning are now shaping the market. **ROI is no longer optional**, it’s the air we breathe, and execution speed has become a defensibility lever. This environment has surfaced a set of patterns that now guide how we think about AI in healthcare going forward.

### Scaling AI Faster than Healthcare Workflows

In the U.S., abundant capital pushed AI quickly into clinical and operational workflows, from documentation and triage to billing and care coordination.

However, that speed exposed a hard limit: **healthcare workflows don’t evolve as fast as software**. Many solutions arrived before systems were ready, leading to fragmentation and new operational complexity. Optimizing one task often just moved friction elsewhere.

The takeaway is clear: **speed alone doesn’t create impact**. Without strong integration and workflow alignment, AI risks amplifying inefficiencies rather than resolving them.

### Clinical Rigor and Infrastructure-first Execution

Europe has taken a different path. **Less rush, more scrutiny**. Regulation and market structure forced a slower pace, and that has become an advantage for more sustainable healthcare AI deployment.

AI is gaining traction first in well-defined settings like private care and specialized clinics, where workflows are clearer and integration is easier. Beyond these niches, the focus has stayed on **clinical rigor, data quality, and regulatory alignment**.

System-level pressures are shaping adoption, from workforce shortages to access constraints. Rather than scaling broadly, many European teams are aligning AI with specific clinical problems, following a more deliberate, **infrastructure-first path to execution**.

### Verticalized Solutions vs Holistic Models

This is where the thesis clicks. **Healthcare doesn’t reward broad**, horizontal AI, it rewards fit. And fit comes from deeply understanding the problem, the data, and the real work being done.

What works are vertical solutions tied to specific decisions and outcomes. In healthcare, impact only happens when AI changes action; which is why I’m betting on **precision over breadth, and execution over abstraction**.

### The Bottom Line

The companies that will matter most won’t be the ones chasing hype. They’ll be **the ones rebuilding healthcare from the inside out**; rethinking data flows, decisions, and how technology fits into daily care.

**The real winners are building connective infrastructure, not just tools**, with clear boundaries between automation and oversight. As adoption accelerates and regulation matures, this is what allows AI to move from novelty to necessity.

### What I am Leaning Into

My conviction is simple but demanding. The strongest companies start with a **clearly defined problem where AI can deliver immediate, measurable value**.

This comes down to verticalized data, deep workflow understanding, and integration built in from the start. Solutions need to be tightly aligned with the problem they’re solving and know exactly where they fit in the healthcare stack.
