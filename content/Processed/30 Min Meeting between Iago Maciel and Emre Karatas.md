### Iago’s Background & Experience

- 10 years in product in regulated industries in LatAm, last 3 years in fintech and insurance
- Built a bank in Mexico focused on payments for merchants
- Led global banking team at ADB in Bav before leaving to become closer to being a founder
- Started insurance business focused on cyber and property & casualty with telecom industry in Brazil
- Left job in March 2025 to attend Stanford AI and entrepreneurship program

### AI Insurance Problem & Market Opportunity

- Insurance industry has lots of exclusions around AI, lots of fear, lacks data on how to underwrite AI risks
- Healthcare providers caught between wanting to accelerate AI adoption but doctors hold liability, innovation stalls
- Crisis of trust across AI - hospitals and companies not scaling AI beyond pilots and demos because of liability concerns
- Liability puzzle unclear: when AI kicks in, who is liable - doctor, provider, or hospital?
- Medical malpractice policy evolution still uncertain

### Product Vision & Approach

- Building AI risk management platform combining NIST AI framework, ISO 42001, AIX with observability layer
- Measuring AI risks from different levels within organization:
	- Governance and strategic level
	- How companies deploy AI
	- How systems are behaving day-to-day
- Three-phase vision:
	- AI risk management platform for providers to manage internal AI projects and vendor/partner risks
	- Build underwriting engine with proprietary data (not lawsuits/incidents data)
	- Add insurance layer on top based on proprietary data set

### Current MVP & Technical Implementation

- Already built MVP with two components:
	- Agent that gathers company data via URL scraping for higher quality company information
	- Self-assessment questionnaire - compressed, business-friendly version of NIST AIX and best practices
- Developing observability layer with SDK integration to measure different use cases
- First use case: vendor risk management
	- University hospitals buying AI from different vendors
	- Integration in procurement requirements to assess companies
	- SDK integration to monitor AI system behavior through every release and model update

### Fundraising & Next Steps

- Currently raising $250K angel round from operators, got 3 commits same morning as meeting
- Target to close angel round by Friday as SAFE
- Planning first institutional check in November based on three milestones:
	- Finding co-founder through multiple trials (focus on values and culture fit)
	- Securing first design partners and customers (University Hospitals in Cleveland as potential first)
	- Building focused MVP
- Traveling to Cleveland next week to discuss partnership with University Hospitals
- Will update Virtue VC on progress and notify if timeline accelerates
