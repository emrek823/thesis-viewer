- Updated deck with key additions:
	- “Why now” slide addressing investor feedback
	- Deal terms on ask slide
	- Customer logos with annualized revenue ($126k ARR)
	- Competitive positioning grid vs Claude and ChartSwap
- Positioning as infrastructure layer, not application layer
	- GetCodes Health example: they’ll use Hermes for record retrieval while focusing on abstraction
	- Austin Mills (CTO) wants Hermes for SONAR and patient histories
- Site SONAR flagship product for 2026: cheaper, faster, more coverage than medical canvasing

### Revenue Momentum & Operations

- Current ARR: $126k (10,600 MRR shown as misleadingly low number)
- November: all revenue from CZ Law record retrieval
- December: minimal records as CZ Law tested performance
- January forecast: $25k conservative, potentially $35k
	- CZ Law switching all business from Midwest Record Retrieval (500 requests/month)
	- 90%+ of current ARR captured in last 60 days
- Key messaging shift: emphasize momentum from $20k to $300-400k ARR potential in 30 days

### Fundraising Pipeline Status

- Target: close $4M seed round in next 45 days
- Active prospects:
- Define Ventures dragging feet, low confidence
- Flir Capital working with Torch on diligence

### Investor Outreach Coordination

- Torch term sheet signed, using for momentum
- Three categories for follow-up:
- Virtue to make intros and update shared tracking spreadsheet
- Focus on quality over quantity - not reaching out to 100+ people

### Next Steps

- Alejandro: send follow-up emails to all prospects beginning of year
- Virtue: make intros to highlighted prospects, update spreadsheet
- All: coordinate at JPMorgan Healthcare Conference (Monday-Thursday)
- Alejandro: maintain updated tracking sheet with interest levels and passes
