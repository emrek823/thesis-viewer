## Slide 1: CareRev

![CareRev Logo](CareRev)
CareRev
A SaaS enabled marketplace for healthcare staffing

## Slide 2: Why is on-demand hospital staffing a marketplace opportunity?

**Hospital expenses increase but revenue stays flat***.
*   Baby Boomers enter healthcare.
*   Overstaffing is expensive, but each diverted patient costs $6,000 in lost profit**.
*   Expensive high employee turnover.

**Healthcare Professionals need extra income**
*   3x12h shifts per week, lots of free time.
*   "Canceled shifts", unpredictable income.
*   Hard to find extra shifts, work in non-healthcare related side gigs.

## Slide 3: In October 2015 CareRev was founded to build a software platform combined with a 1099 workforce.

**No friction**
*   Professionals are easily able to get shifts.
*   Hospitals get right professional at the right time.
*   Last minute staffing makes sense.

**Network effect**
*   CareRev fill rates are 90% vs 25% industry standard.
*   Shifts are filled within minutes.
*   Hospitals decrease expense of overtime and inflexible travel contracts.

## Slide 13: Bottom-up market size and Opportunity

**Bottom-up market size**
$160 Billion GMV
$48 Billion Net Rev

Sources:
1.  Beckers Hospital Review - percent of staff that is part-time in hospitals.
2.  AHD.com
3.  Mission Community Hospital public P&L.

**Current spend: $8 Billion GMV**
In 2018, $1.25 Million GMV from our 145 bed hospital.
There are 6,210 Hospitals in the US, average bed size is 150.
6,210 hospitals x $1.25M = $8 Billion GMV.

**But, same hospital spent $26 Million on part-time wages**
$107 Million spent on operations in 2017.
60% of operations spent on staffing = $64 Million.
40% of staffing is part-time = $26 Million.

**Potential opportunity: $160 Billion GMV**
$26 Million x 6,210 Hospitals = $160B GMV.
30% margin (new contracts) $48 Billion Net Rev opportunity for CareRev.

## Slide 14: Go-to-market strategy

**Month 1**
*   Outreach to Surgery Centers.
*   Start professional Recruitment.

**Month 2**
