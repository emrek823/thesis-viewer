1.  **Ingest Claims Data**
    A minimum of 12 months of Claims Data is loaded into the MavRx system. The data is reviewed and normalized instantly, preparing it for analysis.

2.  **Historical "Reprice"**
    A historical reprice is conducted to determine "net" historical cost after program and rebate savings. A historical reprice is then provided for each option.

3.  **Predicted "Goprice"**
    The claims data is adjusted to reflect changes in utilization, price inflation, and churn - "trend". Trend is applied and a "Net Cost After Trend" value is created.

4.  **Expected Cost Calculation**
    The Net Cost After Trend value serves as Expected Cost value. This value is unique to each of the PBM's evaluated for a Plan Sponsors Rx Only Stop Loss coverage.

5.  **Aggregate Corridor Calculation**
    Adjustable aggregate corridors available with a benefit up of up to $10m. Corridor is derived from the Net Cost After Trend value, not from Gross Cost.

6.  **Stop Loss Premium**
    Stop Loss premium is calculated using a variety of different factors including group size and credibility, as well as PBM validation level (PCI Score 0-100).

## Slide 5: Plan Sponsor Protection

PMPM Guarantee

## Slide 6: PMPM Guarantee Introduction

### PMPM Guarantee Definition
A contractual agreement between a PBM and Plan Sponsor that sets a fixed amount, represented as a PMPM, as a performance benchmark.

### Underperformance
PBM provides the Plan Sponsor with financial protection if the costs exceed the benchmark. Assuming the difference between the guarantee and actual performance. (eg $120)
*WriteWise will digitally perform the audit & reconciliation

---

**Exclusions**
*   Covers all drugs, with few exceptions
*   Highest value to Plan Sponsor
*   Can be used by Plan Sponsor as a true budget

**Alignment**
A PMPM Guarantee aligns the interests of the PBM and Plan Sponsor by incentivizing the PBM to effectively manage the program by penalizing them if they do not.

**Accountability**
A PMPM Guarantee is the simplest and most effective way to hold a PBM accountable for their management of the plan.

**Certainty**
Budget certainty is provided to the Plan Sponsor by capping the plan's financial exposure.

**Evaluate**
A PMPM Guarantee is the simplest way to evaluate PBM's in a repricing or RFP exercise by reducing the impact of all other variables.

**Chart: PMPM Guarantee Performance Illustration**

*   **X-Axis (Values shown below chart):** $115, $120, $125, $130
*   **Performance Line:** A horizontal red line indicating a benchmark (PMPM Guarantee) at $120.
*   **Vertical bars:** Represent individual claim costs or periods relative to the $120 benchmark.
    *   Vertical bars to the left of $120 (e.g., at $115) represent performance below the benchmark (green, implying savings).
    *   Vertical bars to the right of $120 (e.g., at $125, $130) represent performance above the benchmark (red, implying underperformance by the PBM requiring financial protection for the plan sponsor).
    *   A bold red dot on the $120 line with an arrow extending rightwards suggests that costs exceeding the $120 benchmark lead to underperformance.

## Slide 20: PMPM Guarantee Expected Claims Impact (PEPM)

### What is a PMPM Guarantee?
*   Retrospective trend cap on PBM-based Rx (e.g. $80 PMPM; $128 PEPM)
*   If final net spend exceeds $80 PMPM (after discounts, rebates, etc) PBM reimburses plan sponsor
*   Plan Sponsor pays claims in real time, reconciliation occurs post-plan-year
*   Includes all drugs covered by the PBM contract
*   Excludes drugs run through the Medical (e.g. infusions)
*   Creates "Expected Rx" certainty

*Note: Values for Claim Factors, Agg Premium, and Spec Premium are estimated from the visual representation of the stacked bars. "Claim Factors" is used here to represent the lowest segment of the bar, which corresponds to the "Agg Factors" in the PMPM Guarantee tables (Slide 21), minus the other premiums. The numerical labels on the chart's bars represent the total Max Cost (PEPM).*

## Slide 24: Key Takeaways

MGU's who adjust their pricing models can offer more competitive stop loss quotes, decreasing Max Cost proposals by 5%-25%.

**PMPM Guarantees Shift how Rx Risk is Underwritten:**
Financial responsibility shift from MGU to PBM allows MGUs to de-rate catastrophic Spec & Agg risk assumptions:
*   Rx cost certainty and PBM assumption of catastrophic risk allows MGUs to lower the Rx component of Spec Premium.

**Cap on Rx spend decreases Rx claims factors:**
*   Reduced Rx claims factors lead to a reduction in Agg Premium.
*   Allows MGUs to reduce the Rx corridor, allowing plan sponsor to significantly lower funding requirements.
