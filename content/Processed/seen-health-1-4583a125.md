**Dr. Angela Fitch**
Internal Medicine/Pediatrics/Obesity Medicine
Co-Director MGH Weight Center, Assistant Professor HMS, President-elect of the Obesity Medicine Association, Chair of Jenny Craig Science Advisory Board

**Ben Wanamaker**

## Slide 3: Primary care is failing over 70% of the American public
Primary care is failing over
70% of the American public

**Healthcare avoidance**
69% of adults who have obesity or are overweight have experienced weight-related stigma from their doctor, leading to avoidance of primary care

**Inadequate treatment**
For those patients who enter primary care, the disease of obesity is not managed (1.3% of eligible patients receive a weight loss medication prescription, as PCP's do not feel adequately trained)

**Worsening health**
This care leads to lack of preventative screenings, more advanced and poorly controlled chronic disease, and low health-related quality of life

**Higher costs**
An expensive population is more likely to visit the ER, doctor shop, and spend more on direct healthcare costs

    *   Reasons I want to be skinny:
        *   so the outfits I plan in my head have a higher chance of looking cute
        *   so I can be picked up without instantly thinking how heavy I am
        *   so my doctor can stop telling me I'm overweight/unhealthy based on my BMI
*   **Quote (Reddit):** "It's the No. 1 reason I won't see a doctor. You just leave feeling ashamed when you're already sick. Who would want that? Whatever is going on with me, I just deal with it. I'll only see a gynecologist once a year because it's required to retain a prescription for birth control.”

    *   Well maybe you'll feel better if you lose some weight.

## Slide 5: Surveys and focus groups support the research
Surveys and focus groups
support the research

*   Being seen and being taken seriously were critical to positive medical experiences; the opposite was consistently true of bad medical experiences, which were extremely common both in primary care and other specialties
*   Care model elements most important to focus groups were physicians and staff with high EQ's and weight-inclusive approaches, welcoming physical offices, physicians acting as quarterbacks, and insurance coverage
*   “One size fits none" is a very powerful marketing message
*   Proposed care model resonated greatly across focus groups with considerable interest in joining a practice like SEEN (all expressed interest)
*   Interestingly, “normal” BMI survey respondents also showed significant interest in the clinic's core elements

I don't think I've ever been to a physician knowledgeable on obesity... [they even tell me] my asthma (since childhood) is because of my weight – Focus Group participant

## Slide 6: 1.5 trillion, and growing
1.5 trillion,
and
growing

The direct and indirect cost of chronic weight-related illness for those with obesity or who are overweight in the US to individuals, employers, and insurance providers

**Percent of the United States**

| Year | Overweight (%) | Obesity (%) |
| :--- | :------------- | :---------- |
| 1995 | ~34            | ~16         |
| 2000 | ~34            | ~20         |
| 2005 | ~34            | ~24         |
| 2010 | ~34            | ~27         |
| 2015 | ~34.5          | ~30         |
| 2020 | ~35            | ~32         |
| 2030 | N/A            | 49% (projected) |

*(Note: "Overweight" line appears relatively flat between 34-35% across the years shown. "Obesity (by 2030, 49%)" is an annotation, representing a projection beyond the graph's x-axis range.)*

## Slide 7: Comprehensive care, without the prejudice
Comprehensive care,
without the prejudice

A holistic, patient-first primary care & obesity medicine ecosystem that invites patients to come as they are, ending their one-size-fits-none experience with healthcare.
Because patients are more than a number.

## Slide 8: SEEN will leverage obesity medicine to recruit patients and create value
SEEN will leverage obesity medicine
to recruit patients and create value

This model leverages the unique dynamic of obesity medicine: the supply-constrained specialty typically refers to primary care, not the other way around

*   **A Behavioral health, nutrition, and remote patient monitoring:** A comprehensive offering to help patients with their goals, all billable to insurance
*   **B Robust primary care:** With physicians trained, by us, in the disease of obesity to help scale the practice
*   **C Specialty pharmacy:** Owned by SEEN health, delivering convenience for patients and margin for SEEN
*   **D Curated referral network:** Specialists opt into SEEN training to qualify as a referral partner, ensuring our patients receive great care by staying within our network of providers
*   **E Bariatric surgery:** We take risk on patients through a bariatric bundle, and for those who ultimately pursue weight loss surgery, we provide their long-term care

## Slide 9: For patients, the PCP will be their quarterback
For patients, the PCP will be their
quarterback

*   **High EQ, obesity trained primary care doctor who acts as the quarterback for patient treatment**
*   **Modern, convenient physical offices** with size-inclusive equipment, thoughtful layouts (e.g., no public weighing), in-house labs, and specialty pharmacy
*   **Integrated digital experience,** offering remote patient monitoring, telemedicine, quick access to care team, prescription refills, coaching, and a community forum
*   **In-house obesity medicine physicians** for those patients wanting the latest in weight loss and metabolic disease treatment; once initial treatment is completed, patients will be managed through the primary care physician
*   **In-house registered medical dietitian and medical social worker** for those interested in working with the obesity medicine physician, group therapy, and to ensure all patients have access to comprehensive obesity treatment
*   **Carefully curated list of external specialists** (e.g., cardiologists) who are willing work closely with the practice and undergo basic training
*   **Community of local and national patients** who support each other

| Majority of primary care doctors feel unprepared and unqualified to treat obesity, largely due to training gaps | Physicians trained in best-in-class, weight-inclusive approach                                                                                                                                                               |

## Slide 11: Patients, Providers, Payors, Employers benefits
*   **Patients: Improved health**
    Consistent and better care from physicians through a weight-inclusive approach, welcoming doctors and staff, a full-suite of services, and an improved in-office experience
*   **Providers: A job they love**
    Less administrative burden through staff and technology, ability to practice obesity medicine and primary care, competitive pay, and ownership in the company
*   **Payors: Reduced costs**
    Reduce yearly obesity-related disease burden of $2-12K per patient; also reduce ER visits (patients 80% more likely to visit because of lack of primary care), increase compliance, and potentially offset risk through a bariatric bundle
*   **Employers: Higher productivity**
    Increase productivity (reduce absenteeism, presenteeism, and short term disability); and also utilize offering as recruitment tool

## Slide 12: This model will create value for patients and for shareholders
This model will create
value for patients and
for shareholders

Run rate of $1.27M in EBITDA (21% margin) for each physical location; ~$6M in revenue per location

*   Expect significant margin expansion through nationwide virtual care, asynchronous care, and shared services across sites
*   Model uses conservative estimate of 80% FFS and 20% Medicare patients (capitated risk); 50% of primary care patients pursuing obesity medicine, who enroll in nutrition counseling and RPM
*   For each additional location, cash flow projected to be profitable within the first year for each acquired practice; opportunity to pursue additional ancillary fees (e.g., employer membership)

## Slide 13: Competitive Landscape

## Slide 15: Our seed round will help us continue to test key hypotheses
Our seed round will
help us continue to test
key hypotheses

**Patients (15% of seed funds for marketing)**
*   Community partnerships can make organic D2C acquisition cost-effective for virtual care
*   Our model will allow patients to overcome previous weight stigma and seek care or change providers
*   Approximately half of patients will seek obesity medicine

**Physicians (70% of funds for clinical staff)**
*   Mission, administrative support, and ownership in the company will be a compelling package for physicians
*   Physicians can be trained relatively quickly in a weight-inclusive approach
*   There are a few obesity medicine clinics open to acquisition

**Payors (15% of funds for rest of model)**
*   Early engagement data will be promising and allow payors to see value in model
*   Model will be compelling for FFS, Medicare, and Medicaid
*   There is ultimately a path for better contractual pricing, including a potential bariatric bundle
