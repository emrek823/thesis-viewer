## Slide 60: Information Lifecycle Management

*   The cloud storage resources (buckets) have defined retention and archival (nearline, cold) policies as mandated by HIPAA and customer requirements
*   32Health implements soft-delete within the dbs using well defined APIs
    *   We only update the is_deprecated flag in every record and mark them as deleted
    *   The same flag is reverted to restore the records
    *   This is part of the BaseModel which is used by all the models in our APIs
*   Used by all Models and APIs on 32Health Platform

**Retention policy (for compliance)**
Prevents the deletion or modification of the bucket's objects for a specified minimum period of time after they're uploaded. The optional step of setting retention mode to "locked" ensures that no one (including you) can shorten or remove the retention period.

*   Retention period: 10 years
*   Effective date: August 4, 2023 at 12:14:22 PM GMT-4
*   Retention mode: Unlocked

Tip: You can save on storage costs by adding a complementary lifecycle rule to delete objects when they reach the end of their retention period.

## Slide 61: Minimizing Data Loss

*   32Health would use read-write replication to minimize data loss and improve API throughput
*   32Health Databases are truly isolated for every microservice
    *   Scaling issues would only be isolated to hot spots in 32Health’s application
*   For hotspots, 32Health will use Cloud Spanner to achieve horizontal scaling, preserve ACID compliance of data records and ensure transactional consistencies
    *   Cloud Spanner has a SLA of 99.999% availability
*   The PostgreSQL databases are replicated with High Availability plus a GCP SLA of 99.95%
    *   BigQuery which is a managed service has clustering and partitioning built-in and has an uptime SLA of 99.99%

**Security Components:**
*   **GitHub Advanced Security** (Code scanning for security vulnerability and secretes)
*   **Binary Authorization** (for an extra layer of container security)
*   **Artifact Registry** (for authorized containers with scanning for OS vulnerability)
*   **IAM for RBAC** (for making sure only authorized personnel have access)
*   **Identity Aware Proxy** (for restricting DEV/STG applications to internal users)
*   **Security Command Center** (for comprehensive scanning of resources within VPC)
*   **Web Security Scanner** (Workload Identity Federation - removing need for service account keys)
*   **Secret Manager** (for securely storing credentials, keys)
*   **Cloud Audit Logs**
*   **Data Loss Prevention API** (to scan and redact PHI during data egress)

Confidential & Proprietary
66

## Slide 67: Security: Tenancy

*   Each client's data is logically and physically separated from other clients
    *   A set of database per client
*   Access to the database is via separate IAM service accounts which enforce separation of data
*   Only the Application instance and related services -deployed for client - is authenticated to communicate with db

Confidential & Proprietary
67

## Slide 68: Security: Access Control

*   For external access to the app, we use Auth0 to implement support for multiple roles and groups
*   For internal access, we leverage GCP identity groups and roles created using Cloud Identity/GCP Workspace group & Cloud IAM using the principle of least privileged access and zero trust as much as possible.
    *   Example: prod-users group only has (limited) read access to Prod and the general dev-users has no access to Prod
    *   Example: Machine to Machine auth and general auth within pipeline is via strictly via service accounts
*   Admin access is via a dedicated admin identity group defined at the 32Health org level (GCP best practice) with access to limited authorized personnel. Membership into this group or its privileges cannot be tampered with by project level admins. This is not set via IaaC and is set directly on the console.

Confidential & Proprietary
68

## Slide 69: Secure Development

*   32Health has a well defined Secure Development Policy
*   MFA mandatory for GCP, Github
*   Predominant use of GCP Cloud Workstations for development
    *   Strict access control for repos - controlled environment for developers
    *   Faster and secure development - no downloading of credentials ever
    *   Use of shielded VMs - hardened images
*   Via GCP policy, several strict security measures enforced -Examples no public ip access for dbs, no public buckets, no credentials keys generated, no RDP, SSH, no public IP machines
*   Github secret scanning, code scanning, dependabot scanning, protected branches
*   A combined Github flow and Gitlab flow branching strategy eliminates inadvertent push to higher environments
*   Maximum use of GCP Assured Open Source Software to ‘shift-left’ security
*   GCP connectivity to Github via Workload Identity Federation - no use of credential keys
*   GCP automated Artifact analysis for OSS vulnerabilities
*   Binary authorization prior to deployment

Confidential & Proprietary
69

## Slide 70: Application Security

*   Pervasive use of Secret Manager that eliminates storing credentials in code
*   Use of SQL Cloud connectors that leverage auth via service accounts and eliminate knowing ip addresses of databases
*   Only Identity Aware Proxy based access for internal users of applications in lower environments => prevents any accidental access to our applications.
*   SSO external users implemented via auth0
*   Continual vulnerability assessment from GCP Web Security Scanner
*   Pen test (planned once a year) for both application and infrastructure
*   Continuous scanning of infrastructure underlying application.
*   Application services only auth via service accounts - zero-trust leveraged as much as possible.
*   Use of Cloud Armor - DDOS and web attack defense on edge
    *   Protect against SQLI, XSS etc
    *   Allow/Block traffic based on IP, GEO
*   API security (discussed later)

## Slide 74: Encryption at Rest and in Transit

*   Data encrypted at rest by default.
    *   Several layers of encryption across Application, Platform, Infra and Hardware are used to protect user data.
    *   We have the ability to rotate keys using GCP Cloud Key Management Service (KMS). We can also support CMEK using Cloud KMS
*   Data is encrypted in transit using TLS while communicating with clients up to GFE (Google Front End)
    *   Within 32Health's environment within GCP, ALTS (Application Layer Transport Security) is used.
*   Data is stored within our systems in a HIPAA compliant way using data security & privacy controls including retention policy and redaction
*   We are in the audit phase of SOC2 Type II certification

74

## Slide 75: Audit, General Logging & Track Users

*   32Health uses Cloud logging from GCP's Operations Suite for our centralized logging solution
    *   Cloud logging from GCP's Operations Suite logs events across all components and services of our platforms
    *   Cloud logging has client libraries in Python and Node that make it easy create comprehensive structured logs when events are detected.
*   32Health uses native GCP Audit Logging supplemented by custom logging which audits admin activity, data access activity and system events from all resources used within 32Health including databases, applications, compute instances, buckets, IAM, APIs
*   32Health uses application logging, auth0 logging, database logging to track changes to groups, members, claims
    *   Using auth0, we can track when users logged on and how long they were logged on
    *   Using GCP audit logging we can track internal users
*   The database tables themselves log the changes to records
*   We use datastream for Change Data Capture to track CRUD operations from operational db (PostgreSQL) to BigQuery

## Slide 83: Backup, Recovery & Replication

*   32Health’s supported model is Cloud SaaS
*   Operational DB RPO < 5min
    *   EDA keeps data messages in queue indefinitely
*   BigQuery (99.99% availability), Spanner(99.999% availability) DBs are automatically multi-region with backup and recovery built in
*   For Cloud SQL, planned RTO is 1hr
    *   Data backup to multi-regions and read replicas are easily setup through a simple interface
    *   We are implementing GCP's Backup and DR service to further improve the resiliency
    *   For reads we automatically failover to the read replica. For write failure, we slow down write retries while we recover the db
*   For the application, the external load balancer automatically handles failover
    *   Note that we don't use managed instance groups (compute vms) for hosting the application
*   The system supports replication of the db and configuration info both via the UI and via IaaC
    *   Cloud Datastream is used for Change Data Capture logs. Other instance logs can be easily replicated using a combination of Cloud logging and BigQuery.

Confidential & Proprietary
83

## Slide 84: System Processing, Scaling & Monitoring

*   Hybrid processing architecture supports both Event Driven Architecture (EDA) - primary arch and Batch
*   Our system comprises of microservices and is fully distributed with horizontal scaling based on meeting queue, cpu/memory loads and priority thresholds.
*   Batch processing is implemented using one or more of Cloud Workflows (GCP's pipeline tech), Cloud Data fusion (ELT/ETL tech), Cloud dataflow (Apache Beam) tech.
    *   Common to combine sync and async sub-workflows in a pipeline
    *   GCP's Cloud Scheduler to schedule jobs and start/restart and stop jobs at arbitrary times
*   We leverage Kubernetes underneath and we are able to scale up servers in the 1000s to process millions of records per hour - paper claims, EDI 837D and Eligibility, CSV files for claims and eligibility
*   We use GCP’s built-in load balancing within region and zone and an external/internal load balancer for multi-region https
*   We detect duplicates to improve processing
    *   Cache intermediate step results in the pipeline
    *   Fast composite key hashes (e.g. combining provider, member, claim info, dates of service)
*   For real-time monitoring, we use GCP Operations Suite
    *   Real-time Dashboards
    *   Alerting to phones, slack, email, pager-duty
    *   All resources on GCP stream logs into Cloud Operations Suite
    *   GCP Chronicle in consideration for a native SIEM implementation

- We use scalable compute (Kubernetes) and storage (CloudSQL, Spanner, Datastore,Firestore, vertex ai vector db, elastic search) that can be horizontally and vertically scaled with increased workloads. The servers scale with fixed cpu, memory and queue size thresholds. Memory and cpu increase often correlate to increase data sizes. Data storage is conservatively upper bounded at ~ 700GB per 100K members - Note that this estimate is subject to change

## Slide 94: Support & SLAs - Data Backup & Recovery

*   32Health’s supported model is Cloud SaaS
*   The maximum and minimum data loss per service/component in the system are bounded
    *   These maximum estimates are rolled up to provide an RPO estimation
    *   EDA keeps data messages in queue indefinitely
*   BigQuery (99.9% availability), Spanner(99.9% availability) DBs are automatically multi-region with backup and recovery built in
*   For Cloud SQL, planned RTO is 1hr
    *   Data backup to multi-regions and read replicas are easily setup through a simple interface
    *   Point in time recovery is down to a fraction of a second, via write-ahead log archiving
    *   We are implementing GCP's Backup and DR service to further improve the resiliency
    *   For reads we automatically failover to the read replica. For write failure, we use a hot DR pattern to slow down write retries while we recover the db
*   For the application, the external load balancer automatically handles failover
    *   Note that we don't use managed instance groups (compute vms) for hosting the application
*   The system supports replication of the db and configuration info both via the UI and via IaaC
    *   Cloud Datastream is used for Change Data Capture logs. Other instance logs can be easily replicated using a combination of Cloud logging and BigQuery.
    *   We are implementing continuous replication between Cloud SQL and Spanner using Striim

## Slide 110: Go Live - In Production Proposed Strategy

**Strategy A - Begin with one standalone module for one line of business**
*   Start with Provider Network Module (recruiting, credentialing, contracting, onboarding) and roll out for one line of business (e.g. Individual or one state or TPA or one business partner)
*   Roll out Provider Network Module for other lines of business
*   Continue rolling out other logical groups of modules
    *   Pros: Quick value realization for recruiting and contracting Providers to client Network

**Strategy B - All modules for one line of business**
*   Follow the configuration and implementation plan and roll out one line of business at a time
*   Roll out other lines of businesses in two more phases (least risky lines of businesses first, high risky businesses next)
    *   Pros: Lowest risk, ensuring all kinks/bugs are detected early and mitigated, business exceptions for lines of business are identified, segregated in the planned release, feedback can be incorporated into the next business line that goes live, ensuring client’ clients customer satisfaction and SLAs are not disrupted
    *   Cons: client will have to maintain two systems in parallel for a short period of time

**Strategy C - All modules live at once for all lines of business**
*   Least preferred approach
*   Very risky, as minor issues could impact client operations across all lines of business, potentially disrupt the business and have customer dissatisfaction

**32Health is open to client preferred approach and will work together on deploying client strategy**
