# The Healthcare AI Adoption Index

## We partnered with AWS and Bain & Company to learn from 400+ healthcare buyers on what’s driving AI experimentation, from proof-of-concept to production, and how this will impact startups and innovation partners.

![Healthcare AI Adoption new image with stethoscope](https://www.bvp.com/assets/themes/bvp-24/img/clear-post-banner.gif)

The healthcare industry has reached its AI inflection point, a technological shift mirroring the earlier transition to electronic health records (EHRs)—but this time unfolding at warp speed.

The changeover from paper to electronic health records spanned more than a decade, aided by the [HITECH Act of 2009](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/cms-and-onc-final-regulations-define-meaningful-use-and-set-standards-electronic-health-record), which paid incentives to doctors to adopt EHRs. Yet progress was slow, plagued by reticence to change and complex, disparate processes. In stark contrast, just two and a half years after LLMs became accessible to the masses, AI is now a top priority in healthcare. It’s shaping boardroom agendas, fueling startups (i.e., healthcare AI applications), and easing daily burdens for clinicians, scientists, and administrators. Curiosity has quickly turned into action, with a wave of experimentation underway to reinvent care delivery, diagnosis, and drug development.

Bessemer Venture Partners, in partnership with Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Bain & Company, surveyed more than 400 leaders across Payer, Pharma, and Provider segments to understand how healthcare buyers are approaching GenAI applications—what jobs-to-be-done they prioritize, how they’re making adoption decisions, and where their projects sit on the adoption curve.

## Recorded presentation

**Unlike the earlier shift to EHRs, today’s GenAI innovation isn’t just coming from healthcare AI applications but rather from inside healthcare organizations themselves. Internal development teams are building their own tools by partnering with horizontal AI labs (i.e., Anthropic), Big Tech companies, or by procuring new solutions from incumbent systems of record and healthcare IT (HCIT) vendors.**

We found that there is a flood of internally and externally developed GenAI proof of concept (POC) projects, but few make it to implementation at scale. Early-stage application layer startups must learn to navigate healthcare’s evolving go-to-market landscape, while buyers need to separate the signal from the noise and build dynamic AI strategies. This report is a snapshot of today’s healthcare AI landscape and we plan to continue tracking the adoption, evolution, and impact of these solutions. To that end, we give our “diagnosis” of the current state of opportunities with the [**AI Dx Index**](#Introducing-the-AI-Dx-Index), which can help founders, buyers, and investors accurately assess where our industry is in the AI transformation curve and where the most significant areas for opportunity in the near term lie across nearly 60 jobs-to-be-done.

## Top takeaways

* **AI adoption is accelerating,** driven by internal teams co-developing with Big Tech and cloud providers—not just startups (i.e., healthcare AI applications).
* **60% of execs report AI budgets outpace IT spend,** with funding decisions centralized within the C-suite.
* **Only 30% of AI pilots reach production,** held back by security, data readiness, integration costs, and limited in-house expertise.
* **Startups have significant growth opportunities ahead:** As of now, only 15% of AI projects involve vertical AI applications, and just 32% of executives believe GenAI solutions from startups are superior to those from large tech incumbents. Yet 48% of executives say they prefer working with startups over established players, highlighting the potential for startup founders to co-build and serve emergent AI strategies.
* **Trust and outcomes matter most**—procurement is shifting toward co-development as 64% of execs are open to co-developing with early-stage partners, particularly with those startups that show clear and attributable ROI.

## The state of AI adoption today

Healthcare organizations overwhelmingly see AI as a strategic priority—and they’re backing that belief with investment. In our survey, 95% of respondents said GenAI will be transformative, with 85% of Provider and 83% of Payer leaders expecting it to reshape clinical decision-making within three to five years. This is faster than we anticipated, given the industry’s regulatory complexity and low tolerance for error.

Across all segments, 84% believe AI will impact clinical decisions, 80% expect it to reduce labor costs through automation, and many see the potential for revenue gains. However, only 57% of Pharma executives believe AI will drive most new therapy discoveries in the next decade, reflecting the complexity and long timelines of drug development.

![majority of executives have big aspirations](https://www.bvp.com/assets/uploads/2025/04/Majority_of_executives_HC_AI_I_Slide4-min.png)

Executives are putting real money behind their AI ambitions; the data shows that there’s an upfront investment to AI innovation and staying ahead of the curve compared to competitors means starting yesterday. (We describe budgeting trends further below.) Still, it's early days. Only half of the organizations surveyed have a clear AI strategy, while 57% have an AI governance committee, and Payers are leading the way. That said, 54% are already seeing meaningful ROI within the first year of GenAI implementation.

**To understand where GenAI can deliver the most impact, we surveyed executives on 59 key jobs-to-be-done across the healthcare value chain:**

* **22 for Payers** (claims, network, member, pricing)
* **19 for Pharma** (preclinical, clinical, marketing, sales)
* **18 for Providers** (care delivery, revenue cycle management)

![59 jobs to be done](https://www.bvp.com/assets/uploads/2025/04/59_JTBD_TOC_HC_AI_I_Slide5-min.png)

We found that nearly half (45%) of the use cases across these jobs are still in the ideation or POC phase, with far fewer actually in production. For a full description and breakdown of adoption levels of use cases across these three segments, refer to the Appendix.

![most of the use cases are in experimentation phase](https://www.bvp.com/assets/uploads/2025/04/Most_of_the_use_cases_HC_AI_I_Slide6-min.png)

Providers are ahead in POC experimentation, while most Payer and Pharma use cases remain in the ideation phase. Unlike the [EHR adoption wave of the last few decades](https://www.healthit.gov/data/quickstats/national-trends-hospital-and-physician-adoption-electronic-health-records#:~:text=As%20of%202021%2C%20nearly%204,physicians%20had%20adopted%20an%20EHR.), Providers haven’t had the need for regulation or government payments to incentivize them to adopt AI.

AI-powered ambient scribes for clinical documentation illustrate this rapid adoption. While EHRs improved data handling, they also increased administrative burden, creating an opening for AI. This wave is defined by speed, enthusiasm, and a focus on boosting productivity. Among providers surveyed, 30% have system-wide deployments, another 22% are in implementation, and another 40% are actively piloting solutions.

![How this AI wave differs](https://www.bvp.com/assets/uploads/2025/04/How_this_AI_wave_HC_AI_I_Slide7-min.png)

## Experimentation but not yet production

**Many organizations are running dozens of GenAI POC projects at once, but only 30% of completed POCs have made it into production.** Providers have the most projects making it into production among the segments we tracked, and large Providers in particular are leading the charge with 46% of their POCs going to production.

![Only 30 percent of completed POCs make it into production](https://www.bvp.com/assets/uploads/2025/04/Only_30_percent_HC_AI_I_Slide8-min.png)

So why are so many organizations stuck in the experimentation phase? This wave of AI
