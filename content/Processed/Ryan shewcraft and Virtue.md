### Kevin’s Professional Evolution & Capabilities

- 15-year relationship with Kevin starting at NYU PhD program (same lab, Ryan one year ahead)
- Academic to industry transition
	- Left PhD program at NYU before completion to join Siemens internship
	- Decision driven by Kevin’s pattern: excellent at starting projects, struggled with completion in academic setting
	- PI personality clash contributed - Kevin “all over the place scientifically” but very smart
- Transformation at BMS
	- Ryan shocked by Kevin’s growth from scattered academic to focused executor
	- Successfully published as senior author - demonstrated project completion ability
	- Made bold organizational moves: pitched leadership for significant foundation model funding
	- Gained ear of CTO despite organizational politics and VP sensitivities
- Current strengths
	- Speed of thought - superb ability to think through ideas rapidly
	- Outside-the-box thinking - strength in startups, caused friction in conservative big pharma environment

### Technical Work & BMS Relationship

- Standard Model as BMS evolution
	- Continuation of Kevin’s BMS foundation model work supporting clinical insights
	- BMS focused heavily on imaging with tabular clinical data integration via tab transformer
	- Standard Model expanding to iterate over any relevant data modality including genetics, neuro/EEG
- Current BMS collaboration dynamics
	- Advisory relationship: Kevin seeks Ryan’s input on pitch decks and strategic direction
	- Ryan identifies opportunities and suggests proof of concepts for specific use cases
	- Formal partnership requires concrete deliverables beyond pitch deck stage
	- Ryan leads neuro therapeutic area at BMS - Kevin working on neuro-specific applications
	- Nepotism sensitivities limit direct proposals; other pathways through Anshu and team members

### Foundation Model Industry Landscape & Kevin’s Execution Growth

- Multimodal modeling critical need
	- Current biostatisticians think too linearly/univariately for complex biology
	- Rich neuro data contains untapped signals requiring orthogonal data integration
- Industry adoption challenges
	- Data collection costs - clinical trial managers resist additional data requirements
	- Interpretability concerns - black box models face regulatory pushback
	- Marza Ghasemi paper challenges interpretability necessity - interpretable models may create confirmation bias
- Kevin’s execution evolution
	- Early career: scattered approach, multiple incomplete projects
	- BMS: demonstrated project completion and contextual selling ability
	- Standard Model: now managing technical execution plus business development, partnerships, and fundraising
- Partnership recommendations for best supporting Kevin
	- Leverage network to open doors and create introductions
	- Keep Kevin focused on main priorities - still has “curious scientist” tendency to pursue multiple opportunities simultaneously
	- Already exploring additional partnerships beyond core business
