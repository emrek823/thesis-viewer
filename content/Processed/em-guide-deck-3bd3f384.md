## Slide 1: Title Page

**EMGuide**
Empowering first responders to redefine the patient journey

## Slide 2: John's Story

**John's Story**

*(Visual: A man's face (John) at the top, followed by a horizontal timeline with icons representing a patient with a bandaged arm, an ambulance, a hospital, an hourglass, and a doctor with a plus sign, indicating a journey through the healthcare system.)*

---

## Slide 3: Low-acuity patients make up a large portion of the EMS calls

Low-acuity patients represent an increasing problem in the EMS space, with almost half the patients transported not requiring emergent services

- **37M** Estimated number of 911 calls EMS responds to per year
- **40%** Estimated percentage of responded calls that are low-acuity or non-emergent

*(Visual: A diagram showing a central point with three arrows pointing outwards to circles labeled PC, UC, and ED, representing different care pathways.)*

---

## Slide 4: Emergency departments need help

90% of Emergency Departments (EDs) in the US are overcrowded and understaffed due to unnecessary EMS transports and non-emergent patients

### Overcrowded EDs
90% of EDs nationally routinely report crowded conditions, leading to physician burnout and worse patient outcomes

### Unnecessary EMS Transports
Over a third of ED volume comes from EMS transports, many of which are of low-acuity patients who don't need to be in the ED

**Penn Presbyterian Medical Center (PPMC)**
**Total Diversion Hours**

| Year | Diversion Hours |
|---|---|
| 2020 | 787 |
| 2021 | 2205 |
| 2022 | 557 (Projected additional for rest of the year: 2544*) |

*PPMC is projected to have over 129 days-equivalent of “diversion” hours, which represents when the ED cannot provide prompt care due to the high volume of patients*

---

## Slide 5: Health equity lies at the center of the problem

Black and Low-Income Americans reported significantly higher rates of ED utilizations and lower access to primary care than White Americans

**National EMS -> ED -> Discharged Visits**

| Segment | Percentage |
|---|---|
| Black & Latino | 70% |
| All Other | 30% |

**Emergency Department Visits by Payor Type**

| Payor Type | Percentage |
|---|---|
| Medicaid | 37% |
| Commercial Insurance | 29% |
| Medicare | 20% |
| Others | 14% |

---

## Slide 6: Misaligned incentives drive the problem

Operational inefficiencies, underutilized EMS and misaligned reimbursement policies are key drivers of the problem, precluding patient-centered care

### Operational Inefficiency
*(Visual: Icon of a broken bone)*
Patient triage by a physician occurs too late in the process, creating a bottleneck of patients waiting to see a healthcare provider in the emergency department

### Underutilized EMS
*(Visual: Icon of three medical professionals)*
EMS currently only stabilizes and transports patients to the ED, even though they can assist with on-scene treatment of patients under the guidance of an emergency medicine (EM) physician

### Reimbursement Policies
*(Visual: Icon of a dollar sign on a document with a plus sign)*
EMS are only reimbursed by payors if they transport a patient to the ED, creating misaligned incentives and allows low-acuity patients to come to the ED

---

## Slide 7: EMGuide empowers first responders to redefine the patient journey

EMGuide is a EMS technology company that allows first responders to provide point-of-care teletriage services, diverting non-acute calls away from the emergency department

### Integrated Platform
*(Visual: Icon of a smartphone connected to circuit board elements)*

## Slide 8: EMGuide redirects the patient journey to provide the most appropriate care

EMGuide's platform allows EMS to provide point-of-care telemedicine and teletriage services, diverting non-acute calls away from the emergency department.

*(Flowchart description)*

1.  **911 call received**
2.  **EMS service initiated**
3.  *(Decision Point)*
    *   **Patient's Chief Complaint is non-divertable**
        *   EMS transports patient to the hospital ED
    *   **Patient's Chief Complaint is under divertible protocol**
        *   *(Side Note: Chief Complaints with Low Admissions Rate and Low Acuity)*
        *   EMS activates telemedicine response through EM-Guide
        *   *(Decision Point)*
            *   EMS and virtual care team provides treatment in place
            *   EMS transports patient to alternative facility (acute primary care)* for treatment
                *   *(Side Note: Determination made by EM physician with EMS assistance)*
        *   Care Coordinators contact patient to arrange primary care follow-up
            *   *(Side Note: To avoid later hospitalization and increase primary care)*

*Only in states that allow transport to non-ED destinations

## Slide 12: EMGuide provides tangible benefits to all stakeholders

EMGuide benefits all stakeholders involved, including patients, physicians, hospitals and insurance companies

### Stakeholders

-   **Patients:** provided the appropriate level of care, decreasing their medical bill and providing them with primary care services to avoid utilizing the ED
-   **Hospitals:** Significantly decrease ED overcrowding and diversion hours, leading to an increase in the number of patients who need higher-level care within the hospital, raising overall hospital revenues
-   **Payors:** Decrease overall healthcare costs incurred by payors due to decreased utilization of costly ED services and increased use of physician and telemedicine services

### Opportunity

-   **ET3 Regulation:** New pilot from the Center for Medicare Services (CMS) that allows for reimbursement of EMS treatment-in-place without ED transport
-   **Hospital Closures:** decrease in inpatient beds (27%) due to hospital closures leads to ED overcrowding – in Philadelphia, recent closures of Hahnemann, Brandywine and Jennersville Hospital
-   **Value-Based Care/Teletriage:** nationwide movement to lower ED expenditure, increase primary care services and leverage telehealth capabilities

## Slide 13: Our total addressable market represents a huge opportunity

The market for low-acuity EMS calls that are divertable is conservatively estimated to be $2.46B - this represents the total potential savings for insurers

**Starting point: 37M annual EMS calls**

| Category            | Percentage/Value      | Result (M/$)     | Rationale                                                   |
| :------------------ | :-------------------- | :--------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Demographics**    | 40% low-acuity patients | 14.8 M           | low-acuity patients are our target demographic              |
| **Insurance**       | 83% Insured Population  | 12.28 M          | Uninsured population is unlikely to be able to pay          |
| **Target Population** | 50% target divertable population | 6.14 M           | conservative estimate of divertable ED population           |
| **Average ED Cost** | x                     | $400             | average savings with diversion away from the ED             |
| **TAM:**            |                       | **$ 2.46 B**     |                                                             |

## Slide 14: Our revenue will move from fee-for-service to a shared-savings model

EMGuide will generate revenue initially through a fee-for-service model and will eventually move towards a shared savings model with payors

### Free Platform
EMGuide's API platform with telemedicine capabilities and care coordination will be free and integrate into EMS agencies existing software

### FFS Model
FFS billing makes EMGuide a low-friction choice for payors initially ready to partner

### FFS -> Shared Savings Model
EMGuide will evolve into 50/50 shared savings revenue model based on the results of the FFS model

### Unit Economics per Diversion

| Payer Savings per Patient | Value   | EMGuide Costs per Patient | Value   |
| :------------------------ | :------ | :------------------------ | :------ |
| Medicaid ED Reimbursement | $400    | Physician + Social Worker | $150    |
| Medicaid PCP Reimbursement | $92     | EMS Incentive Payment     | $50     |
| **Average savings per patient** | **$308** | **Average Cost per patient** | **$200** |
| **Revenue Range per Patient** | **$308-$200** |                         |         |
| **Revenue per Patient**   | **$254** |                         |         |

## Slide 18: FAQs

1.  **What about the legal liabilities of diverting a patient away from the emergency department? What happens in the off-chance a patient dies?**
    It's important to note that even when patients go to the emergency department (ED) and see an emergency medicine (EM) physician, the physician is still making the call to send the patient home or not, taking on the risk that the patient may have an emergent medical condition that was missed in the evaluation. In our system, the same EM physician is making that decision, so we are no different than if the patient physically went to the ED. Furthermore, we are not forcing any patients to not go to the ED. In fact, patients will be signing a refusal waiver, acknowledging that they willingly agree to not go to the ED after evaluation by our EM physician and EMS.

2.  **What about EMTALA? Don't EMS have a responsibility to bring patients to the ED?**
    We have chatted with numerous lawyers and senior counsel in the healthcare space and all have agreed that the EMTALA statute only applies when the patient is within geographic proximity of the ED. Moreover, it does not apply to non-hospital owned or operated ambulances who arrive at the scene to triage and evaluate patients.

3.  **Would this divert too much volume from the hospital/emergency department?**
    Since we are targeting patients who arrive at the emergency department by EMS, we would only be looking at around 20-30% of the emergency department volume. Since approximately 40% of this volume would be divertable, at maximum, we would only be diverting away 10-15% of emergency department volume. Furthermore, diverting this lower-acuity volume away from the hospital would allow emergency departments to actually see higher-acuity patients and patients who will have a higher in-patient admissions rate, generating higher revenues for hospitals.

4.  **Are you providing a SaaS?**
    Yes, we will provide an EMS centered technology platform that integrates with existing emergency response infrastructure. Beyond being in sync with CAD, ePCR, and EHR software, our platform will also allow EMTs to teletriage with the help of a virtual physician.

5.  **Why hasn't this been done before?**
    There is 1 other company working within this space - MDAlly. MDAlly was also founded at Wharton in 2019 and initially started as a 911 dispatch company, bringing the triage even earlier in the process. However, they have most recently pivoted to working with EMS agencies, much like EMGuide and raised approximately $9 million. We actually think this attests to our business model and our approach to the problem since it took MDAlly 2+ years to arrive at the business model we have today. There's enough room in the EM space for 2 companies and we believe we have a superior management team with both clinical and operational experience to position us to gain market share and adoption.

6.  **Do EM physicians feel comfortable performing this triage virtually?**
    We've talked to numerous EM physicians and all have stated that they feel comfortable doing virtual triage and evaluation, especially when there is EMS staff available as well. They learned how to do this during the pandemic and are trained to do this on the spot. In fact, 80% of diagnosis can be made simply from a history.

7.  **What's in it for the EMS agency? They make money by bringing people to the ED. If they don't bring people to the ED, won't they lose out on their revenue stream?**
    Currently, EMS agencies only receive reimbursement from payers if, and only if, they transport someone to the ED. But as of 2019, CMS has implemented a pilot program that allows for reimbursement even if the patient is provided on-site-care or is transported to an alternative care facility. We intend to ride the coattails of this new regulation.
    Additionally, we will also leverage behavioral economics and pay EMS agencies to do the right thing. We will provide an instant $50 cash payment for each diverted patient. EMS agencies have a hard time recouping money for the services they provide. So, the ease and convenience of our reimbursement is very attractive to them.

8.  **After the determination to not go to the ED is made, how do you prevent the patient from not going to the ED later?**
    We have a robust care coordination of nurse navigators, social workers and other ancillary support staff that will follow-up with the patients after each diversion to make sure they are connected with the right primary care services.
