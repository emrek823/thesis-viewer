# 2025 Preview: What does the year ahead hold for pharma?

January 2, 2025

Biotech will remain in recovery mode for the next 12 months, after hitting rock bottom in 2023. The sector has taken its time recuperating from those lows, and there are few reasons to expect a rapid rally in 2025.

Pessimism does not prevail, though. Investors expect more deal making in the coming year and while the sector remains skittish, there are strong drivers of growth in the form of the GLP-1s and a range of other innovations.

This data-driven report pinpoints the pivotal events on the horizon for biopharma in 2025.

**Grab your copy to find out:**

* The drugs and companies growing pharma’s top line
* The therapy areas acting as brakes and drivers across the industry
* How a second Trump administration may impact the year’s outlook
* The new therapies waiting in the wings

**Join us on January 23rd 3pm GMT | 10am EST for our 2025 Preview webinar** as we unpack the big questions from the report. Our experts will talk through the data, the trends and answer your questions about the year ahead. **[Register Now.](https://www.evaluate.com/webinar/2025-preview/)**
