# Team - 5 Full time today (+ 1 start end of April)
Founding Eng still top priority

## ZoomLogi
**Job Title:** Founding Engineer

**Company Overview:**
At ZoomLogi, we're on a mission to redefine visibility in pharmaceutical logistics. Every year, $35 billion worth of life-saving medicines and vaccines are wasted due to failures in temperature-controlled logistics – failures that impact millions of lives. With real-time data aggregation, predictive recommendations, and rapid interventions, we're transforming the pharmaceutical supply chain to prevent waste, reduce inefficiencies, and ultimately improve patient outcomes. The Pharma supply chain is among the most demanding in logistics, and our software solution is purpose-built to meet these challenges head-on, providing visibility across temperature excursions, communication gaps, chain-of-custody failures, and more. As a member of our initial core team, you will play a pivotal role in achieving this vision and work closely with the founders.

**Position Overview:**
The Founding Engineer will assist with building and scaling the company's technology stack (front-end and back-end). This role will focus on developing and deploying scalable, user-centric solutions that enable real-time visibility, predictive insights, and seamless customer interactions.

**Key Responsibilities:**
*   **Product Development & Platform Build-Out:**
    *   Assist with the development of Platform (real-time visibility, alerts, scorecarding)
    *   Build in-platform communication features (e.g., calls, emails, texts) and integrate AI-powered check-call functionality (starting with 3rd-party integrations).
    *   Drive the development of AI-based recommendation systems (routing, provider/location optimization, risk modeling).
*   **Scalable Infrastructure:**
    *   Ensure the platform is built to scale to 100+ users, 100,000s of data point updates every 5-10mins in the next 12months
    *   Ensure all systems and applications comply with data security, privacy, and other industry standards (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR, SOC 2, etc.).
    *   Collaborate with the Head of Integrations to enhance data aggregation capabilities and build low-latency infrastructure for real-time platform updates.
    *   Prioritize system stability, performance, and scalability to support rapid customer growth.
*   **Team Building & Leadership:**
    *   Act as the lead engineer during the initial phases, writing code and delivering product versions.
    *   Begin hiring and building an engineering team starting in June 2025.

## Key takeaways
1.  Importance of financial flows (e.g. reimbursement / payments, order to cash,..) for all parties
    a.  Need to weave that more in our value props
2.  Role of Specialty Pharma (SP) – Demand, but also take financial risk off
    a.  Specialty Pharma wasn't part of TAM so far → Will focus on it
3.  Logistics software underserved (1 booth, interest from most Ent connections to hear more)
    a.  Follow up with all
