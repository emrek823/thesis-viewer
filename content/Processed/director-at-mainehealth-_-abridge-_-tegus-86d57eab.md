# Abridge - Director at MaineHealth

Interview conducted on August 04, 2025

## Topics
AI Scribe, Epic Integration, Ambient AI, EMR, Cognitive Overload, Clinical Documentation, Coding Accuracy, API Integration

## Summary
Discussions between the Tegus Client and the expert from MaineHealth and other healthcare organizations focused on the integration of AI tools, particularly Abridge, to address provider burnout and improve documentation efficiency. The transition from Nuance to Abridge was driven by the need to reduce documentation burden and improve coding accuracy, with Abridge being praised for its physician-led approach, deep integration with Epic, and lower pricing. The conversation also touched on the technical aspects of integration, potential benefits in terms of data security and efficiency, and the evaluation of other AI tools like Suki. The potential of Abridge in revenue cycle management and expansion into referrals, prior authorization, and pre-visit processes were also discussed, highlighting the importance of integrating Abridge with Epic for various patient-related actions.

**Q:** What is your main use case for these solutions? Please elaborate.
**A:** Our healthcare system uses Abridge for AI ambient dictation/scribe for clinical documentations. Secondly, we use it to help with billing code suggestions. Currently, it is being used by providers only and will later explain to nursing.

**Q:** Can you speak to the current & future trends and challenges in the space? Please provide an example.
**A:** Yes, I was part of two evaluations as part of the key decision makers in which we piloted Nuance and then later Abridge. In the second evaluation, we selected Abridge as our permanent AI ambient dictation solution for our entire healthcare system. However, we are also monitoring the market as other solutions such as Ambience Healthcare are significantly advancing their billing code functionality.

**Client**
Awesome. We can kick things off. We're spending time researching the healthcare AI space more broadly and understand that you are currently a customer of Abridge. Really want to use today to better understand your overall thoughts on IT evaluation process and the market more broadly. We'll have some more specific questions, but just to start, it would be great to get a brief one-minute overview of your current role and then we can go into all of our questions.

**Expert**
That sounds great. I am the informatics director at MaineHealth and my role and the 25 physician informaticists to support and manage the organization, the evaluation, selection, design and implementation of clinical and IT solutions. A few years ago now, we have added AI to also our scope of work. My supervisor who is a chief medical information officer and I have started an AI advisory committee and we've been doing that to bring in more AI into our environment which hence the Abridge that we're going to be talking about and then standardize the way we use AI in our environment. That's what I do in MaineHealth.

**Client**
That's really helpful. What are the priorities for you guys as it relates to bringing AI into the organization? Are there any specific workflows or use cases where you wanted to start with first?

**Expert**
A lot of it is around provider burnout. Healthcare systems have always been struggling with this. Providers have burnout because they're seeing patients and that's what they want to do because that's why they went to medical school. Being part of a physician is to document the care that you provide patients. Everything about the patient and you say to the patients and do to the patient or prescribe to the patient must be documented for the patient safety and continuing of their career as they go see other providers. There's definitely documentation burden. It's a buzzword, but it's real and it does happen.

Providers are just tired of documentation. They struggle with the EHR, and then it comes with that is cognitive overload. We were trying to improve the providers' burnout and their satisfaction with the EHR to also solve the problem, which is their shortage of staff.

Before COVID we always struggle to try to hire enough people. Post-COVID, now it seems to even more struggle to try to get enough people in the department that we need. That also then leads into more dissatisfaction with providers because they don't have enough colleagues to cover each other, and then more documentation, more burnout. Those are the overarching reason why we had to go to an ambient AI dictation tool to improve efficiency for our providers in their documentation.

**Client**
That's really helpful. Just this little context, are you using any other AI tools in your stack today, whether it is for RCM, billing, or any other workloads like that, or is it really just Abridge right now?

**Expert**
We have other things. It just depends on what you look for. Even in the research space, we do have AI as well in Epic, it's our EMR. You probably know if you know Epic well, there are a lot of AI tools in there that we have implemented. Actually, there's a lot more in Epic that we have not implemented that we will be implementing for both the ambulatory and the inpatient side. Just to answer your question, we have other AI tools, and then outside of Epic, like one of it, I could say, I could give example, like Celerity is an AI tool that we use. It basically has a coding that is written in the backend. It uses ocular content recognition.

Basically, recognizing things on a page and then using the code or the formula that has been built down the backend. It recognizes what the document is that has been sent to us, which then automatically files into the patient record so that that document is linked and is with the patient record and it is not just sitting on someone else's. That's one of the examples.

**Client**
Got it. I'm sorry, I should have covered this initially, but the organization that you work for, is it just like family doctors or what type of, or is it everything? What type of medical practice are you?

**Expert**
I can give a little info about MaineHealth to help with your benchmarking. MaineHealth is a healthcare system of 12 hospitals, 745 clinics. Our annual revenue is about $4 billion. We have about 4,000 providers, 1,400 beds, 22,000 employees. I mentioned we're on Epic, and we've been on Epic since 2008. I think right now we're at about 2.3 million patients in our EMR. We cover all specialties, ambulatory, inpatient, cardiology, oncology, behavioral health, hospice care, you name it, we have all of those specialties.

**Client**
Got it. That's really helpful. To be clear as well, are you using Abridge across all of MaineHealth, or is it just specific areas that you cover? I think you mentioned 25 physicians at the start, but sorry if I misunderstood that.

**Expert**
It's an enterprise contract, so it is offered to all of our physicians who want to use it. Right now, we're not mandating that our providers use what we call a tool. This is a tool for them to help with their work. If you work at MaineHealth, you use Outlook. For example, you probably use Outlook for email, but your organization may give you Microsoft Copilot. Copilot is now a tool that you can use. Abridge is a tool for our providers to help them with their cognitive overload, their documentation burnout, but it's not mandatory that they use it.

I'm trying to remember how many licenses we have right now. I think we have about 500 for providers. When I say providers, I mean physicians and APPs. Those are nurse practitioners and physician assistants. We also purchased 340 licenses for residents and fellows. I think the last report I saw about 44 specialties have active licenses for Abridge right now.

**Client**
Sorry, you said 44 specialties have active licenses?

**Expert**
Yep.

**Client**
Okay. Just so I'm super clear, so you said you basically have licenses for 500 providers and 340 residents and fellows. There are 44 specialties that have it right now. Out of those 840, total licenses, are they all being used or do you have any sense of how many are actually being actively used within your organization? Is there no way to tell?

**Expert**
We get reports from them. We'll have to go through the RFP, and the last report was about last month. I think we had about 412 active licenses. It's slowly being rolled out. We actually use the pilot, Microsoft owns Nuance, the Nuance DAX Copilot. We used to have that and then we just recently this year transitioned to Abridge. The word is getting out. It's a tool for people to use and there are requirements. Not everybody can just get it. They have to actually meet their requirements to use it because we don't want to just give people licenses and they're not using it.

**Client**
Got it. We can go more into the contract and stuff or how that's all working later. Maybe then taking a step back, you mentioned you previously used Nuance, so maybe we start there. Can you talk a little bit about why you ultimately decided to look for a new solution? What were maybe the shortcomings of Nuance? What was strength and then what catalyzed you to switch over to Abridge?

**Expert**
If I forget something, just call it out in case I forget. Our journey with dictation started with us building a strategy around supporting our clinicians to reduce their cognitive burden, overload and documentation burden. It is driven by the clinical side. The reason I mentioned that is because if you start looking at Ambience Healthcare, they are also very advanced in suggesting coding for billing. I think they are actually at this point might be more advanced than Abridge. It's interesting, over the past couple years I have seen the shift where anyone who is looking at ambient AI dictation or scribe, like Abridge or Nuance DAX, is driven by the clinical side, which majority of time it is.

We do it because we want happy providers. We want them to show up to work, we want them to document what they did. It is usually driven by the clinical side to help support the clinicians. I'm seeing the shift where it is actually now being driven by the RCM side because if a tool is good for recommending codes, that reduces the provider's time as well and also hopefully enhances the accuracy of the coding, which reduces the amount of time that the RCM team actually has to spend on checking the provider's code.

To be honest, we don't always trust providers with the coding. There are providers who undercode, not to say we want to overcode something, but actually providers, sometimes they see someone for Level three, but they are documenting, like Level two, which does a huge difference. If you are in the surgical world or you are in the inpatient side, the reimbursement is a huge difference.

We drove this initiative through the clinical side through informatics and specialty leaders who said our providers need something to help with the documentation burnout. We selected Nuance. The reason we did that is because we are a Microsoft shop, so we have a lot of Microsoft things. You probably also know a lot of people, a lot of healthcare systems have Nuance Dragon, which is just the dictation. There is no AI to it. Providers talk into the dictation tool, it records the words, and then basically the provider has to edit their own note. We already had those tools.

Through our digital transformation initiative called Application Rationalization, we are trying not to bring in a lot of new vendors. Not to say that we're not going to bring vendors in just because we do not want them to, but we already have a pretty strong vendor, which is Nuance and Microsoft. We thought we would pilot with Nuance to see what the DAX tool was like. At that point, actually, they only had DAX. They didn't have DAX Copilot.

We did an evaluation in October 2021. We started piloting the DAX product in June 2022. People liked it. The people who used it wanted more of it, so their colleagues wanted it. We went into a phase two where we purchased additional licenses. In March 2024, DAX Copilot came out. We piloted that one, and to be honest, it really feels like apples to apples. The tools are pretty similar. What they're doing are pretty similar.

Epic starts to build a really strong relationship with Abridge, which Epic generally doesn't do. Epic doesn't like to recommend vendors, but Epic has a list that they call peerless, which are vendors that they have a deep connection with. They have deep integration into the EHR, which is nice for us because that means less maintenance on our IT side.

Our pilot was Nuance, to be honest, with a really long pilot, but we then kept the pilot, and in addition did a

**Expert**
pilot with Abridge. We had discussion in April 2024. We did the pilot, signed contracts and everything in August 2024. I think the pilot was until November 2024. Feedback was basically the same.

People who use Nuance, love Nuance, people who use Abridge, love Abridge. There are some perks about Abridge. One thing for me at least in the leadership side, it's led by a physician team. The reason why we're doing this is we're trying to support our physician group or provider group. This is a company that's led by physicians who understand physician struggles and their challenges. In addition, they also have a deep connection integration into Epic.

They also are much better in the inpatient notes as what we saw from the demo. There were just some more perks to them. The last thing is the pricing. They're actually cheaper than Nuance. Some of those factors led us to basically end the contract with Nuance. That was January 2025. At that same time, we had already and we were transitioning people over to Abridge as well. That was our journey with them.

We continue to roll out, for example, in June, that's when we started launching the pilot with the ED folks. Lots of things that are standard for templates in terms of, like, there's some standard templates that every specialty can use, and then there are some that are a little bit more specialized, like the ED. We just launched that one in June.

**Client**
That's really, really helpful. A couple of questions follow up from that. First, can we talk more about this integration that they have with Epic? I'm sure there are a lot of other scribe tools that say they integrate with Epic, but why is Abridge's integration so much deeper and what are the benefits to that? The second question related to the Epic integration is I know there's a company called Suki AI that claims they essentially do what Abridge does, but they are offered directly through Epic. They're embedded in Epic. I'm wondering if you came across them, and if you have any thoughts there.

**Expert**
Okay. Let's target your first one. If your first one is what's the benefit of the deep integration into the EMR?

**Client**
How different is Abridge's integration with Epic relative to any other scribe company who might say they integrate with Epic but don't necessarily have that deep relationship?

**Expert**
We guide the technical team and infrastructure team, but I would be more transparent to say that's not my expertise. At a high level, when Epic works with any vendor, if a vendor is working with another vendor and they develop a close relationship and when they say deep integration, at least in the way I understand it, my infrastructure team explained to me, it's like they're using Epic native APIs or something.

Essentially, high level is that the integration allows us better security for the data that's flowing back and forth. Therefore, you're reducing your risk of data leakage or vulnerability to third parties that are trying to breach into your data. That's the way I understand the deep connection, how they set it up. I cannot even answer that for you.

That is so technical that even the CIO would have to also sit down and see how that's built out. I think just generally, just knowing that is they work with Epic to really fully build out the best integration, not to say that Epic can't, doesn't work with the vendors that we choose.

Generally, when you work with Epic and a third party who's going to integrate with them, a lot of the integration conversation is happening between our security, our infrastructure team with the third party that's going to integrate into Epic, and they follow a standard process, which in this case they are following a standard process but with also an integration that Epic has already built in. The other thing I was going to add is this integration that they have with Abridge.

I can't speak to this because I haven't verified it, because it's actually a question that came up recently in a meeting that I was in when we were at Epic conference recently. Everything was about ambient dictation,

**Expert**
and lots of people sharing stories, their success stories about using Abridge in the presentations. One of the things that Epic shared that's coming down the roadmap is that they're going to pull the note, the ambient note from and they didn't say specifically Abridge because Epic doesn't try to use vendor's name. I think they're alluding that they're pulling the note that is developed from Abridge and they're going to pull specific data fields or data into the actual data field.

For example, I'm a nurse, I use Abridge and I'm saying things like, "I see patient, tongue nodes, blood pressure is this, and oxygen level is this, and I just took temperature, blah blah blah." You're saying the numbers and it's getting put in the note. Epic is now building something out.

Where it's extracting the note and putting in the blood pressure field, in the oxygen field, the data field. It's really cool because for nursing that takes time. You probably been to the office where the medical assistant has to put in your blood pressure and your etc. Epic is building that out. I don't know if that means it's just for Abridge or it's for all ambient dictation. I would assume it's for all ambient dictation because you're just using the tool to populate a note and then Epic can pull anything from the note that's populated.

This one I would have to verify for you because I sent Epic a question about that. I think that leap integration is great too. I think it facilitates this process. It's like you're going through a really tight niche integrated pathway is the best way. By the way, when my infrastructure team explains things to me, it's very high level, which helps me. I wouldn't be able to answer your question. I think it helps in this situation if they're doing something where they're pulling actual data into data fields. I feel like I'm rambling on.

**Client**
That's helpful. It sounds like they have a much deeper relationship and API with them that allows more secure data sharing and possibly share greater amounts of data versus a lighter-weight API that Epic might have with some of the other scribe players. That's what I'm gathering there. Let me know if that's wrong. The follow up question that I had as well is have you come across a company called Suki AI who claims to be more directly embedded into Epic's platform? It sounds like they might potentially be powering Epic's ambient voice module that they offer through the EHR. Not sure if you've come across or heard anything about that.

**Expert**
Yeah, and I missed it. You said is it Suki, the actual ambient dictation company?
AlphaSe Sean Doolan sd@virtuevc.com DO NOT COPY

**Client**
That's right.

**Expert**
What was this that you said about Suki? We also actually evaluated them.

**Client**
We definitely want to hear your feedback then. From my understanding, they are embedded within Epic. I don't know exactly how it works, but essentially, you can procure them through Epic. I don't know if it's powering Epic Scribe or what it is, but it sounds like they have a pretty deep relationship with Epic as well. Would love to hear your thoughts on that and overall, what your thoughts are on their platform.

**Expert**
When people say they're integrated with Epic, it just means that they're able to put some of the data that's happening on their tool, into Epic, which in this case is they're bringing their note that's being populated into Epic, which is actually an actual data field in Epic. The note box, is the easiest way to say it. The answer is yes, but all of them are essentially integrated into Epic. Abridge, might be, I don't know, maybe a different pathway or a tighter niche or whatever it is, but they're still all integrated.

Whether you're using Nuance DAX, Copilot, or Suki, they're all integrated. The reason I say "integrated", meaning, integrated in a way where, you can open up your phone and you're using Haiku, which is the phone

**Expert**
platform or app for Epic, and you're talking into that is recording that conversation from the phone, and then it's feeding into the note box or field, whatever you want to call it. They're essentially really all the same. That's just the workflow.

You talk into the phone, it records it, it puts the notes into Epic. Epic later, down the road, will then extract some data from there and put in actual data field. Right now, the priority is getting the note created because that's what providers need to do after they see a patient.

**Client**
Got it. When you evaluated Suki overall, then, what was the reason ultimately you didn't go with them? Is it really just they didn't have that same level of deep integration with Epic, or were there any other issues that you experienced with their product?

**Expert**
We use resources like KLAS Arch Collaborative or Gartner when we're looking at vendors. We try to better understand the vendors that are out there and the top vendors. KLAS will actually rate these vendors for specific use cases. In this case, this is AI scribe. They ask hundreds of healthcare system leaders like myself, CIOs, CMIOs and folks and basically be like, "What do you use for AI scribe?" They'll ask specific questions and then they try to rate them and score them.

In our case, we actually went to KLAS and we did see Suki was on the list and we actually sent the evaluation RFP questions to them. Further research, even through KLAS and also their responses, you can tell at the point when we did our RFP, they mainly were used by smaller organizations and had experiences working with smaller organizations.

We knew we're a healthcare system with 12 hospitals, 745 clinics with 4,000 providers. We're going to expand it into the nursing side as well. We have a lot of nurses. We didn't want to go with an organization that just didn't have experiences working with larger organizations. Maybe by now they might have more experiences and have bigger healthcare system names under their belt on their resume. At the point that we did it, they really have only had experiences with smaller organizations.

**Client**
Got it. One more question on that and this is all super helpful, so so appreciate it. I was just doing some more Googling and it looks like Suki actually does also power Epic's Haiku platform, the ambient scribe there. Was your concern still with that that Suki really only was used by smaller organizations? How do you perceive that given I'm sure there's a lot of large organizations who are using Haiku as well? Wondering if the experience might have just been lower quality with that. Any color there would be helpful.

**Expert**
That's a good question. Anyone who's doing admin dictation into Epic is using Haiku. It's not a thing that stands out. The majority of them are using Haiku because that's the way to talk into the phone to translate over into Epic. Honestly, at that point we were just not going to be evaluating four or five vendors and invite them in to do demos

Part of evaluations, I don't know if you've done much with them, we used to have five, six vendors come in, and then they would come separate days and do demos and have the sales people there. That requires time and resources. If they're there, that means everybody from the evaluation committee has to sit there and basically see the demo and then rate them. We've gotten more efficient with our evaluations.

We really tried to send RFP questions out and we narrow them down where we have two or three vendors that we're asking to come in. At that point, we had Nuance, Abridge, and Ambience Health. Those were the three that we narrowed down to. Unfortunately, Suki and Nabla, we took them out just because they really didn't have much experience with the larger organizations at the time that we did evaluation.

**Client**
That makes sense. I didn't realize this, but it looks like Abridge can be accessed inside of Haiku as well.

**Expert**
That's the way the notes are getting into Epic in the first place, no matter which tool you're using. Is that right?

**Expert**
Haiku is Epic's mobile app that they're using.

**Client**
Got it.

**Expert**
It's like you can go to the bank, Chase bank, but then you can go to Chase bank on your app.

**Client**
That's super helpful. We've gone through two key. We've gone through Nuance. One other thing that you mentioned on Nuance versus Abridge that I just want to go back to is the quality of the inpatient notes. Can you maybe elaborate a little bit more on why Abridge had better inpatient notes?

**Expert**
I think it's just they have continued building it out. Just like any company, they're building things out as they do it. The easy one to focus on is ambulatory. I honestly still don't understand why the difference is why ambulatory is easier. There are shared templates more in the ambulatory side, maybe. I actually had never got that question.

If you look at a lot of these others, like even Nuance, the majority of their focus is really more ambulatory. Even until now, you can expand into inpatient, but honestly, they specialize in that ambulatory setting because there are different templates in the ambulatory. In ambulatory, there are lots of different templates, then you get into inpatient, they also have lots of different templates. Where do you focus your time?

There's a lot of people on the ambulatory side, and it's more control within the ambulatory setting. You had a patient who comes into the office, they sit at the desk. It's easier. You don't have critical patients who are at the hospital, like, particularly have critical patients. You're probably not using ambient dictation there. They have more notes built out.

I don't know if I could say the quality because I haven't really seen a lot of inpatient because when we use Nuance, we mainly use ambulatory. They really just continue to build. They're currently building out a lot of their inpatient templates. We never use any of the inpatient template because we didn't feel like it was ready.

When you hear people say, "We're in the process of building it out," you're not going to test that in the clinical environment where the ambulatory was already set, they've been using it. It's been used by other healthcare systems. We felt really comfortable using ambulatory templates. To hear that they're working on inpatient templates and you're going to be the guinea pig.

It's hard to, at least in my organization, I'm not comfortable having providers document and having the AI scribe create a suggestion for the note because there is a risk that some providers may not check their note fully. Maybe when they're particularly in the inpatient side, they're rushing from one patient to another, they're being called on a code. There's some critical situation happening. It's not very a controlled environment to give someone to test a new template. That's why I can't speak to really maybe the quality, but rather that they don't have those built out as robust as Abridge does.

**Client**
Got it. Outside of Nuance, Abridge, Suki, were there any other players that you evaluated in this market?

**Expert**
We had Nabla, which actually there wasn't a lot about them during the time. You can always find them and

they responded. Didn't seem like a lot of folks were using them. It's Nabla and then also Ambience Healthcare, which actually at the time when I was evaluating, I didn't think as impressive of Ambience Healthcare, but I have since then.

They are definitely a company to look into. You can look this up too. I think it was Cleveland Clinic, I think, who recently signed a huge contract with Ambience Healthcare. It's driven, I think, by their revenue cycle team to better increase their accuracy of the coding and also suggested coding. They evaluated Abridge as well, and they felt that Ambience Healthcare was way more advanced in the coding side, which is very interesting.

**Client**
Thank you. We'll definitely look into that one. On the coding side as well, for you guys, curious what your thoughts are on Abridge's abilities there. How your experience has been with that for them?

**Expert**
I think it's been fine. I haven't had much feedback except that with coding, it can be a little tricky because it has to be very specific. This is feedback from the team. When you're coding, I think sometimes you can say hypertension versus there can be different types of hypertension, or it could be you have diabetes, but it's diabetes one, two, three. There are things that seems like that's really detailed, that sometimes the AI might not be catching the detail because I don't know if you use AI or ChatGPT, sometimes you can tell it's trying to make things concise, which is what we do want the note to be.

Unfortunately, there are providers who we call note bloat, which is a common term in the EMR world, which is there are providers who write way too much in their note, but they don't realize because they want the next provider who needs to see the note to know what happened to the patient, what was talked about. Sometimes it's too much because they don't realize the next provider who looks at the note needs to spend the time to actually review the notes before they see the patient.

If somebody's writing a novel, someone else has to read that novel in order to get ready for their visit. I'll give you a use case. I'm a primary care provider. I recommend Mr. Johnson to go see a cardiologist. The cardiologist is going to have to read the primary physician, though.

If the primary care physician wrote a novel, that cardiologist is stuck reading that novel. I think the point of AI too, is trying to be concise, is trying to capture everything, be comprehensive, but yet concise, but unfortunately it then leaves out some details that then doesn't help with the coding. Is it because of the I'm not an engineer or coding person. Coding in the backend, I don't know how that works. Is it how Abridge has built a formula encode in the backend that is leading to this or what? I don't know, but I know we've missed out where it's not suggesting the code that's specific to the actual. It's catching, say, hypertension, but it's not hypertension Z versus hypertension B.

That's what we've noticed. It hasn't caused any issues because again, providers are it's mandated and required that you check your notes and you check the code because you are the one who knows the patient. You are the one who know the encounter that you have with the patient. They have to check everything. We actually haven't tracked this, but I this gave me an idea.

We haven't started tracking providers, how many times they changed the code. I don't know if Abridge could do that. That's something that might be interesting to actually track, to see if Abridge AI suggested code PH3.25, but then can they see a provider go in and change it to 3.26 instead of 3.25? That'd be something interesting to track.

**Client**
Got it. Does it ever capture things in your notes that you just don't want, no matter what the solution is, whether it's Nuance or Abridge? Are you catching up on conversation, catching up on personal things or other things that don't matter, but it goes into the chart? Does it end up sometimes creating more work, or has that not been a problem for your physicians?

**Expert**
I think I'm catching the question. You're saying, if they talk about a lot of personal stuff, are those things being too much of it being pulled into the note?

**Client**
Yeah. I just have a doctor friend who's used some of these tools and some things will get captured into the chart or the note that you may not want, and so you have to go manually delete it. It ends up creating a lot of work, but that's not a problem for you. If it's not a problem, how do you control that aspect of just regular conversation between the patient and the doctor not getting captured in the note? How does that work?

**Expert**
That's a good point. When we were using DAX Copilot, I had a little bit of feedback about this, but I haven't heard it with Abridge. That's a good point to actually check with my providers. I feel like if you know providers, they will tell you when they don't like something. When we were using DAX Copilot, we would get things like it would capture things that are like, "Great to know for next time." You can be like, "Oh, how was your vacation with your granddaughter?" It's not capturing the other essential that you need and that caused an issue because then the provider felt like they were double doing work. Meaning they're taking high-level notes on their piece of paper.

The patient said "Hypertension" that they're writing a few words on their note to ensure that when they look at the note later it match up. They found that sometimes there were some missing things that they would go in and type, like "Oh, she complained that she had back pain and it started two weeks ago" it might just say "Mr. Johnson had back pain. The pain level is eight." It didn't capture that this happened two weeks ago. I'm just making this up. That's essential in the note. Providers will write just a few words to feel confident that it was capturing everything and that they would then add it in if it was missing. I haven't had that actually feedback with Abridge.

I'm going to assume that it's not creating the extra work that our providers need. Is it probably capturing too much of maybe the additional stuff? Maybe, but those are easy things that you can delete. We always been telling Abridge and even Nuance we don't want a novel. It's also good to capture more than less because the issue is if you create a distrust with the product, which actually a little bit happened with Nuance Copilot. It happened to the providers.

Let's just say the cardiologist, it happened to him a couple times. He started to not trust the tool. He started to write in the same time use the tool and then he was cross-referencing. If you know the act of cross-referencing thing, it takes time, and do I want a provider doing that, that I'm paying $200 an hour? No, I don't want the provider doing that. I want the provider to finish, close up, go through the next patient. We get paid when you see the patients. It's good quality care because we don't want patients waiting. I haven't heard that feedback with Abridge.

**Client**
Is the AI smart enough to know the doctor's voice? It knows which one's the patient, which one's the doctor, and there's no confusion? Does it adapt to that doctor over time?

**Expert**
I don't know if it adapts to the provider over time. That's a question for Abridge. It seems to know because it's capturing what the patient's saying.

**Client**
Got it. Your mention on the codes or the ICD codes not being 100% correct some of the times on hypertension. Using that example, do you think Abridge will move into revenue cycle management and be able to displace some practice management systems or partner with them to get deeper into the payment flows, or do you have some concerns on the ability for any of these solutions to be able to move into RCM?

Before I get to that question, I want to go back to also your other question about recognizing the provider and the patient. It's interesting because I thought a lot about this. As I see it in action, the AI is pretty smart, I have to say, because even though, let's just say it doesn't recognize the voice, but it consolidates the conversation. It generally would know because if you use, I don't know, Microsoft Copilot, although it recognizes people because if they're signed on into the Teams meeting, if I'm talking, it knows that I'm tonal and it records that tonal as a question.

Dr. Anderson responded "Blah, blah, blah," because it knows by the screen. I feel like it's still a little bit similar. Still, though, it's summarizing the conversation. It's not trying to capture line by line by line. It's not saying like, "Doctor said this and patient said this," or "Doctor asked this and patient said this," and summarizing the conversation. Meaning, if the doctor asks a question, the patient answers it, then just summarizes that patient report, "Having knee pain two days ago, blah, blah, blah." Even if it doesn't know the provider asked the question, it's in general, it's summarizing those last couple minutes. Hopefully that helps.

Do I have concern with the coding? I don't. Do I wish I had looked at Ambience Healthcare a little bit? Just because now that I went to Epic GM and people are just ranting about Ambience Healthcare in addition to Abridge. I'm not saying that people aren't loving Abridge, but to hear that, wow, the coding has gone really great and that Cleveland Clinic sign a huge contract with them, that makes me feel like, "Oh, wow, that you're solving two problems. You're solving the RCM side and you're solving the clinical side," which is amazing.

Do I have concern with Abridge? I don't. The reason I say that is because they're transparent. It feels like with their roadmap and what they're trying to achieve to them, the Abridge AI scribe or tool that they have right now, that is just like to them, at least the way they explain to me, it's just a basic tool that's just like foundation.

There's so much more plan on top to layer on top of this basic foundation that they're hoping to drive, such as the coding, the real time coding for conversation. If you look at their roadmap, which I don't know if you guys have access to or they share that, but they're looking to expand and optimize. Those are the keywords. Things like conversations, clinical note, that's what we have now, that's current. That's just to draft clinical notes to reduce documentation burden to them. They did that is because it's medium value but low effort.

It's low effort to create a tool like this. There are other things like compensation to code and claim, which is like real-time coding for RCM, so that's like automate codes, cost claims to basically drive quality in the clinical documentation, even nursing documentation, compensation to care management, they're looking to expand that. As you can see, to them what you and I are talking about, this AI tool is just basic foundation. They have bigger plans.

I'm pretty excited when I saw that they have plans to expand to a lot of different things, care management, clinical trials, clinical decision support, which is like basically helping providers in their decision-making to improve the quality for the patient care. That's great. They're going to do something.

They call it Conversations of Clinical Outcome, which, I think, the way this guy's follow quote, follow through every medical conversation, so everything, and it's trying to combine everything together. Not sure what that truly means yet. I haven't seen the demo. To go back to your question, I don't have concern. I think that they have bigger plans and they have feels like a pretty good team who are pretty engaged who want to push the organization to the next level. We're not the point where to say like, "Oh if the coding is not that great, suggest the code not that great that we're going to move to someone else." It's achieving what we want, which is supporting our providers.

**Client**
Are Ambience and Abridge competitive?

**Expert**
I didn't realize how competitive Ambience Healthcare was until I recently had done more research about them. There are definitely others looking at Ambience Healthcare in addition to Abridge.

**Client**
Competitive or meaning they think both are separate?

**Expert**
Meaning they're pretty competitive with each other now along with Nuance DAX Copilot. They are looking at both Ambience Healthcare and Abridge. I just thought they were really just interested in Abridge, but I'm seeing that there are folks also looking to learn about Ambience Healthcare.

**Client**
Got it. I'm actually curious how you think about the future with Abridge. Where are you in the contract or trial, and do you think you'll ultimately end up going with them? How do you see your spend with them trending over the next 12 months?

**Expert**
Actually, they are now our enterprise solution and tool for ambient dictation. We basically did the pilot with Nuance. We did the pilot with them, but we actually ended up selecting Abridge over Nuance and signed a contract starting this year. That's where now we have moved a lot of folks over to Abridge. We actually fully contracted with Abridge with high three digits licenses.

I'm anticipating there is going to be an increase in the use of licenses because when we did the pilot, we didn't try to expand it all out. We just wanted to better understand the use of it. Now we are rolling it out. We are sharing it everywhere, people who use it. There will be people who don't like things like this, and you will get them. There are lots of them who use it.

It is word of mouth. People like it, they see the data, they hear from the colleagues. Every day there are people reaching out to the project manager that is overseeing this and giving the license to people. The thing is though, there are commitments that they have to follow in order to basically get on to use the license. For example, one, they have to get leadership approval. On average, the provider needs to see 80 patients a month over the six-month period.

They have to be at least 0.5 clinical FTE. Most people will put these type of requirements because you're just not going to give it to everyone. You're not going to pay the license and then just let it sit, and they get it and then you end up not getting the value for your dollars. They need to actually commit that they're going to use their phone.

Every organization is different. Our organization basically said you have to bring your own phone, you have Haiku on it, which you already do. We expect that they use this on their phone and also, we expect that they're going to ramp up their utilization to about 70%-80% of their visits by a certain number of months. There are certain criteria that providers have to follow. I anticipate it's going to increase as people start to hear about it, they're going to want to use the tool. It's just like Dragon. A lot of providers love Dragon, they have always used it. Now, basically, we say it's like Dragon with AI. Someone is going to create the note for you, you just need to check the note.

**Client**
You had some positions that preferred Nuance, some may not be happy that you went with Abridge because there were personal preferences, but you just had more of a better pricing or more users that liked Abridge than Nuance, that's why you went with them?

**Expert**
Those are some of the reasons why we went with Abridge. The people who move over to Abridge like Abridge as well. It's very similar. It's more to say that when they were using Nuance, they liked it, and then the folks who use Abridge during the pilot liked that. We saw that providers generally like AI and they don't seem to have an issue with either vendor. The folks now who are on Nuance are now on Abridge and they also love Abridge. I have not heard someone who say, "I want to go back to Nuance."

We try to track certain things. There are about 200 providers who generated 100+ clinical notes because we

**Expert**
track those users. We don't want people to just have a license and not use it. There's one provider who absolutely was on Nuance and moved over to Abridge. He has over 1,000 Abridge notes. That's pretty crazy for us. Just starting this year, he uses it for everything. Providers don't have to use it every time, but this provider uses it all the time.

You have the people who probably generated about maybe 100+ clinical notes since this year started. When we move Abridge, some have done 500+. You get some providers have over 1,000 Abridge notes, which is crazy. In terms of utilization, I think we're 97% average user retention. There are some who just don't like it, and you can't force them to use it.

**Client**
That makes sense. This might be a crazy question, but obviously Abridge will likely expand into other natural extensions like RCM or billing. Do you think it would ever make sense for them to move into referrals and prior auth and some of the pre-visit processes? Does that not really make sense given the data they're capturing is patient-doctor conversations that may be less relevant for those pre-visit automation? Just curious what your thoughts are there.

**Expert**
I haven't thought about that. I'm trying to think of what the use is. It's like you open your phone, you open Haiku, you talk into it, the patient talks into it, the AI creates the note and the note is generated. That's really the essential of it. I would say yes, just because it seems like a bridge with their roadmap saying they want to get into the care management side and the other. I think yes.

The way I think about things too in terms of use cases is there's patient engagement. Can this help in that space? I would think so. I just haven't thought about it. Things like medical prescription, so patient engagements, like medication prescription, communication with patients, schedule appointment, request refills.

In terms of the AI scribe, you can talk and say certain things and then this AI would then capture and do an action. I think it would have to still be built out with Epic though, because Epic then has a trigger, an action. In Epic, if you're just recording the conversation. Yes, if you're just calling the patient and talking about medication prescription and talking about anything, it can just record that and create a note.

If you call the patient and try to schedule an appointment or the patient requests for a refill, it can quote one in this current state. Just record the conversation, put in a note and say. That happens, if you have a doctor appointment, you call the doctor, the nurse calls back and you tell the nurse, "I've been feeling this here." The nurse starts to create an appointment for you. I can see where the AI can still capture that conversation because actually every phone encounter also needs to be documented. You cannot talk to a patient without documenting that encounter.

In Epic or EMRs, they have the actual appointment visits and they also have telephone encounters, which is when you call the patient in this current state, you just want to capture that conversation. Absolutely. Can it say something? Can you say something like patients like, "Yeah, I'm available Monday at 2:30 P.M. Let's schedule that." Can it then do an action like start the scheduling? That would be super cool. I think you have to build that with Epic.

How Epic is the whole people, like Abridge and all these people are saying they're starting to, I feel like advertise like, "Oh, well, you can start to use it for nursing and then the field will then self-populate into Epic." It's not Abridge building it out, it's Epic building that out. Abridge is just integrated into Epic to create the note and then Epic is extracting the note. That's not what Abridge is doing. It's what Epic is doing.

That would be cool. There are things like, I don't know, prescription, auto refill, referral. I think it's all the same thing. Are you just capturing a note or you want to capture the note and lead to an action? This is where my technical side doesn't lend to be helpful for you. I think a lot of those action that can happen that needs to be worked out with Epic though.

**Expert**
That makes sense. Did my colleagues have any other questions? I do not. This has been really helpful. Appreciate it.

**Expert**
Are you tracking a lot of data from people? Are they seeing good data in terms of efficiency and stuff like that? Just curious, we track a lot of those data for how people like it and all that stuff and how much time reduction in their certain time, how they're spending their time. Just curious if you have, if that's even helpful to you and also if you've been hearing from other people in terms of ROI.

**Client**
This is actually our first call on Abridge, so haven't collected many data points yet. Curious if you've heard ROI trends among speaking with other people in the field, or if you have any stats you can point to around time saved or whatever it may be since using Abridge.

**Expert**
If you're working with Abridge, they will work with you and Epic to come up with solutions. We have them do executive presentations for us pulled together with my informaticist who is assigned to work with Abridge. We pull a lot of data. That's why I was curious if you had it. We do have some ROI in a sense. That's why I asked because I was wondering if people who've used Abridge longer what their estimated ROI is.

We're not at a point to really quantify too much now. Right now, the only financial outcomes that I have, which is a really early estimate of ROI, is basically assuming we maintain 2% increase in appointments and about 1.6 million office visits in the past one year. That's the assumption. If all these ambulatory providers had Abridge, this could translate into additional 33,000 visits.

Whatever you quantify a visit, even if you say a visit would be you can get from a payer $300 a visit, 33,000 X $500 is a lot. It's super early in the game. That's just something we came up with Abridge to share with leadership, with a note obviously to say, "These are all assumptions. We're still following the data," but people are probably tracking things like operational efficiency.

People might say like us, I think it's three to five additional appointments actually are added on average per clinic day. That's great because that's what leadership wants. If they're investing, for us to spend low seven digits on Abridge, they want to know that providers are more efficient and they're seeing more patients, and that's what's happening. That early ROI estimation is an estimation.

To see the data ourselves, we got a report that basically three to five additional appointments have been added on average per clinic day. Providers are saying about average seven minutes saved per encounter, which is like a visit with a patient, reducing their documentation time by 50%. That's like efficiency. People are tracking those things. It's interesting.

I was hoping for the data for this to be higher. That's why I asked you, because we also track provider clinician satisfaction, but our report shows only about 55% reduction in cognitive overload and about 37% reduction in burnout, which I was actually hoping it to be higher, but that's what we got. If you're just asking if they're satisfied with Abridge, 85% said they're satisfied with Abridge.

**Client**
Got it. I know we're at time, so thanks so much for all the help today. This has been a great call. Hope you have a great rest of your day. We'll be sure to reach out to the expert network if we want to chat more.
