## Slide 2: Company Update - Highlights

RIGHT SI+E

Our Q1:24 operating plan is straightforward: (1) close case rate contracts in GA, and (2) hold EMS call volume steady.

**Health Plan Sales**
*   Our new sales lead, Clayton Walberg, revamped our sales process for better organization and focus, which is expected to accelerate deals and improve forecast accuracy.
*   Our Q1 goal is a GA blended rate of $250. We're currently at $87. We're optimistic we can hit the $250 target with our 10 late-stage payer deals (4 FFS, 6 Case Rates). However, despite RightSite's value proposition, payor personnel turnover is slowing our progress.
*   Once finalized, GA case rate contracts will expedite sales with sister plans in TX and FL.
*   Closing standard-rate FFS contracts is usually smooth, but obtaining state licensures for doctors remains challenging.

**EMS/Fire**
*   We aim to maintain steady Q1 call volume and consistent service quality while keeping enthusiasm high from our existing EMS agencies. Word-of-mouth-driven EMS prospect growth in the Atlanta Metro area is strong.
*   To enhance performance across all markets, we're instituting a standardized account management process. This includes a measurable behavior change framework to identify specific activities that boost call volume from medics.
*   Jacksonville Fire and Rescue is struggling with call volume issues (see p. 16 for details). However, these challenges are providing valuable insights that are shaping how we approach selecting future markets, modify our implementation and account management processes.

**Care Team Operations**
*   We're refining workflows with the Navigator and Physician teams by segmenting call/episode types, which is a new step. We've also introduced an SDOH service level matrix linked to patient insurance status. This will provide guardrails for the Care Team to keep our services within the scope of our payor contracts, reducing episode variability and time (cost per call), while increasing patient and EMS satisfaction.

**Engineering**
*   The RightSite Connect platform remains stable and effective. However, our team of 3 engineers can only get to some of the work that could immediately impact episode efficiency and revenue cycle. We are considering adding an engineer in the near term.

**Finance + Revenue Cycle + Foundation**
*   We've successfully completed a seed extension round, with NVP, 8VC, and VV funding the first tranche, and the Friends and Family set to close on March 18.
*   Revenue Cycle: 157 claims through 2023 await submission pending Change Healthcare's data breach fix and a final QA scrub for ⅓ of them. YTD billable claims for 2024 is 143 claims. The estimated allowable for all outstanding claims is $96,000.
*   The RightSite Community Foundation was established, and we're testing its concept with "friendly" philanthropists. The goal is to offset some uninsured care costs, representing up to 20% of the payor mix.

**Challenges**
*   Our short-term challenges include closing GA case rates, modulating EMS call volume without compromising service or enthusiasm, and minimizing spend by delaying some expenditures.

1. Includes a third payroll period ($154K) + annual med mal ($51K)
2. Includes i) quarterly + annual costs adjusted for months and ii) interest income; excludes collections estimate

### MD&A
1.  Jan-24 spend was flat to Dec-23. Consulting & Prof Fees were down due to decreased legal spend. The variance in Other Operating spend was due to RightSite's investment in Mode, a reporting platform
2.  Note in Feb-24 the Company paid 3 payroll periods (2x per year) + the annual med mal policy for all current physicians
3.  Current monthly run rate burn is ~ $450K, which is projected to decline to $175K by YE24, consistent w/ the seed model assumptions
4.  Commercial insurance expense increased in 2024 due to increased cyber coverage and PL coverage specific to the Grady Health System

## Slide 8: Revenue Cycle and Credentialing

RIGHT SI+E

### What Happened - Revenue Cycle
*   Approximately 100 claims through YE23 ready for submission once Change Healthcare resolves its security issues
*   Another ~ 60 claims through YE23 in final insurance review that will be submitted in March
*   Alecta, our RCM partner, is fully connected to and working within AdvancedMD, RightSite's EMR, to scrub and submit claims

### What's Next
*   Submission of claims backlog in March and the 2Q24
*   Add BCBS (40 states) to pVerify insurance discovery tool
*   Workflow planning to maximize efficiency including streamlining through replacement of AdvancedMD as the EMR with RightSite Connect where the fundamental patient data is already collected
*   Finalize remaining medical licenses and Medicare/Medicaid #s

### What Happened - Licensing/Credentialing
*   Heavy focus on completion of multi-state licensing and payor credentialing for the 5 physicians on staff at YE23
*   4/5 physicians are licensed in GA/TX/FL
*   5/5 physicians have interstate licenses (IMLCC LOQ)
*   The Physician Practice has GA/TX/FL Medicare and Medicaid #s
*   State Medicare: 4/5 physicians have GA #; 5/5 have TX #; 4/5 physicians have FL #
*   State Medicaid: 3/5 physicians have GA #; 1/5 physicians have FL #; 4/5 physicians have TX #
*   State Medical License: 1 physician needs 2 foreign state licenses

### Challenges
*   Insurance discovery is a challenge due to the immediacy of a patient encounter. RightSite is experimenting with various processes to gather more accurate insurance information sooner. There is no “frosted glass window” to slide open before you see the doctor!
*   Medicaid licensing is difficult and slow with multi-state physicians, particularly for those that don't reside in the state of service
*   Licensing + credentialing completion across payor types
*   Short-term delay due to Change Healthcare system breach

## Slide 9: Sales - Georgia Payors

RIGHT SI+E

Our payor sales strategy for TX and FL is to close GA plans first. Then, take those approved GA contracts to sister plans in other states for a faster sales cycle. If this strategy works, the top deals in GA would drive contracts in TX and FL representing 70+% member coverage.

**Pipeline**
*   **Executed Payer Contracts:** 10 (9 FFS, 1 Case Rate)
*   **Late-stage Payer Deals:** 10 (4 FFS, 6 Case Rate)
*   **Total Active Payer Deals:** 84 (11 States)
*   **Avg FFS Rate:** $170 (GA only)
*   **Avg Pipeline Case Rate:** $900 (All LOBs)

**GA Blended Rate**
*   **Blended Rate, GA Q1 - Goal:** $250
*   **Blended Rate, GA February - Actual:** $87 (Last month: $82)
*   **Blended Rate, GA Q1 - Forecast:** $250 (Sentiment: Up arrow)
*   **Case Rates Needed to Meet Q1 Goal:** 3

---
*   **Centene:** (GA Medicaid): Case rate contract expected before end of Q1. Execution establishes case rate contracting framework for additional states (TX, FL)
*   **Caresource:** Full Medicaid claims received for analysis, which will drive case rate. Contract addendum approved by legal, case rate contract expected before end of Q1.
*   **Aetna:** Corporate boilerplate completed for case rate. Expect before end of Q1. Sets path GA, TX, FL.
*   **United:** Loading physicians for credentialing, FFS contract expected before end of Q1. Case rate negotiation meetings being scheduled.
*   **Kaiser:** FFS contracting in-process.
*   **Elevance:** Executed FFS (Medicaid), case rate progressing. Loss of key contacts in RIF slowing pace.
*   **Humana:** Executed FFS. $800 case rate agreed, leadership turnover slowed contracting. New owners engaged.
*   **Cigna:** Slow, sale of MA assets to HCSC creates challenges on program ownership.

## Slide 11: Sales - Payors

RIGHT SI+E

### What Happened
*   **1 new FFS contract executed**
    *   Amerigroup GA Medicaid
*   **4 Case Rates in final approach (GA). Executing 3 of the 4 delivers $250 blended rate goal**
    *   Caresource - Medicaid
    *   Centene - Medicaid - $800
    *   Humana - MA - $800
    *   Aetna - MA - $1,000
*   **Caresource - full GA Medicaid claims data received**, providing real-world data for negotiating Medicaid case rates and completing Caresource case rate contract
*   **HCSC (parent of BCBS/TX) - meetings scheduled with Network and Clinical leadership. #1 TX, OK payor by volume**
*   **5 new case highlights published** - (see attached “RightSite Case Studies for EMS.Feb 24”)
*   **Refined Payor and EMS sales collateral**

Other Sales Opportunities where we are managing timing expectations for later in ‘24 after crossing GA our case rate hurdle:
*   **Michigan - Amerihealth Caritas** awarded Medicaid and is acting on executed RightSite LOI. Caritas introduction to parent BCBS MI opens ~50% of market member volume.
*   **Oklahoma - Aetna Better Health** awarded Medicaid and requested to proceed with RightSite
*   **Sacramento Fire** - terminated Tele-911, interest created a window of opportunity to **Kaiser CA**

### What's Next
*   TX, FL contracting blitz - fast follow strategy on executed GA contracts with national players. Centene, Humana, Aetna, United
*   Test “market activation fee/early adopter fee” for payers in new states. Designed to offset start-up expenditures in an expansion state.
*   Michigan, Oklahoma - finalize activation strategy - Go/NoGo
*   Blue's Association (national) Telehealth guidance - receive actionable guidance and direction on Telehealth obstacles (FL Blue)
*   Collaborate with payers to better understand their member density and how that relates to new EMS agency footprints for community expansion. GA first.
*   Determine the H2:24 state expansion strategy
*   Web Site improvements - includes SEO strategies and improved product explanations

### Challenges
*   Payor employee turnover slowing deal progress (i.e., Humana, Elevance)
*   Cigna sale to HCSC further challenges already slow progress.
*   Blues Assoc telehealth rules are ambiguous for permitting telehealth by MDs not domiciled in the state of service.
*   State readiness/credentialing processes are slow, creating hurdles for deal execution and claims submissions.
*   RightSite is a new service model that still requires multiple departmental approvals at payors - even with our case rate strategy

## Slide 12: Sales - Payor Growth and Next States

RIGHT SI+E

Our payor sales strategy for TX and FL is to close GA plans first. Then, take those approved GA contracts to sister plans in other states for a faster sales cycle. If this strategy works, the top deals in GA would drive contracts in TX and FL representing 70+% member coverage.

| Plan          | Plan Active in GA | Plan Active in TX | Plan Active in FL |
| :------------ | :---------------- | :---------------- | :---------------- |
| Aetna         | Contracting       | Yes               | Yes               |
| Centene       | Contracting       | Yes               | Yes               |
| Elevance      | Contracting       | Yes               | Yes               |
| Humana        | Contracting       | Yes               | Yes               |
| United        | Contracting       | Yes               | Yes               |
| Florida Blue  |                   |                   | Contracting       |
| BCBS Texas    |                   | Initiated         |                   |
| **Member Coverage** | **70+%**          | **70+%**          |                   |

RightSite has significant inbound interest from plans in Michigan, Oklahoma, Virginia and Nevada. When the time is right for new market expansion, this same sales strategy (“take closed GA contracts to other market sister plans") would translate into 60% + member coverage in all these states.

## Slide 14: Operations - Georgia (ATL)

RIGHT SI+E

Q1 Focus: Manage EMS relationships to hold volume steady, while preparing for quick expansion upon crossing $250 GA blended rate hurdle

### What Happened
**Implementations & Expansions**
*   Douglas County - transporting fire service
*   Grady Events (sports, concerts, etc.)
*   AFRD - New transporting paramedics in the field

**EMS Account Management**
*   Implemented consistent account management process across all markets, including the measurable ADKAR change management process to increase EMS call volume (see p.17).
*   Continuing to grow the EMS pipeline for future growth once the case rate hurdle is achieved.
*   Relationship-based opportunities led to 7 MOUs submitted for approval by EMS agencies in the Atlanta Metro.

### What's Next
*   Weekly account management meetings continue

**Implementations**
*   City of Marietta Fire Dept - Non-transporting fire service
*   GA expansion (see pipeline slide p.18)
*   Grady EMS - 911-initiated nurse line referrals and dispatch integration (this should be significant volume)
*   Use of ADKAR system and EMS clinician scorecard to increase EMS adoption and call volume (see p.17)
*   Close and implement new EMS partnerships in the pipeline as case rate deals in ATL close.

### Challenges
*   Grady MOU process for activating Dispatch - as our relationship with Grady grows beyond the traditional EMS model, the contracting process slows down
*   Change management strategies for EMS engagement continue to be a learning curve. Making progress is about focusing on the 'users' where old habits can be hard to change vs. the 'choosers' who continue to show strong support and cooperation.

## Slide 15: Operations - Texas (SAT)

RIGHT SI+E

Q1 Focus: Manage EMS relationships to hold volume steady, while preparing for quick expansion upon crossing $250 TX blended rate hurdle

### What Happened
*   SAFD Dispatch has sent 1,100 calls since our launch in September '23, or about 10 calls/day. These are different calls for our Care Team because no EMS medics are on-scene. We are learning what changes in our process are most effective for Field vs. Dispatch-originated calls.
*   Implemented consistent account management process across all markets, including the measurable ADKAR change management process to increase EMS call volume.
*   Early conversations about expansion into SAFD Mobile Integrated Health (“MIH”) and Field medics
*   Consistent delivery of EMS partner performance reporting and materials to help drive EMS adoption and accountability

### What's Next
*   Weekly account management meetings continue
*   Field Activation: we've requested to start small with special groups/smaller units
*   SAFD MIH: Meeting with Molina TX on March 6th - SAFD MIH has an existing contract for high utilizers with Molina TX. This could be a program for us to expand nationally with Molina.
*   SAFD presenting RightSite results at the Nashville Mobile Integrated Health Conference in March 2024

### Challenges
*   Dispatch calls differ from Field calls, where EMS is physically with the patient during the call to RightSite. The ability to assess the patient can be limited, and the Care Team has to be prepared for less information initially
*   The overall response to our partnership with SAFD is overwhelmingly positive. While this is a great start, it also causes a lot of push from them to continue expansion before we're ready

## Slide 16: Operations - Florida (JAX)

RIGHT SI+E

Q1 Focus: Manage EMS relationships to hold volume steady, while preparing for quick expansion upon crossing $250 FL blended rate hurdle.

### What Happened
*   JFRD volume remains low for three reasons: First, the political upheaval surrounding the mayoral race disrupted our launch and led to uncertainty about the future of our main supporter, the JFRD Fire Chief. This caused a temporary freeze in the fire department's operations until the mayor confirmed the retention of the Chief. Second, the Jacksonville market is flooded with standalone ERs, which result in rapid drop-offs for EMS without wait times (but bill at hospital rates.) Third, the conservative stance of the JFRD Medical Director has hindered the implementation of RightSite.
*   In January '24, we relaunched with explicit endorsement from the mayor's office and Fire Chief, aligning with the mayor's health equity campaign promise. We trained 27 JFRD rescue units and 144 EMS clinicians.
*   Our improved account management, with the new measurable ADKAR change management process, aims to increase EMS call volume
*   Integrating RightSite into the JFRD Dispatch process could significantly boost early volume as it bypasses medic behavior change
*   We partnered with JAX Care Connect, a Duval County Safety Net Collaborative, to address uninsured patients' medical and social needs.

### What's Next
*   Weekly account management meetings continue
*   More on-site account management using our ADKAR framework
*   Continue work on contracting with the City of Jacksonville and JFRD to implement RightSite in the Dispatch Center

### Challenges
*   EMS Field adoption of RightSite due to the environment described in the “What Happened” section. We are working closely with the JFRD Fire Chief and the Mayor's Office, both cooperative and engaged, to create success.

| 15-20       | **Progressing** Needs attention and partner check in |
| 21-25       | **Doing great** Monitor changes and push growth      |

**Awareness:** The first step is awareness, which focuses on understanding the reason for the change.
**Desire:** After employees become aware of why they need the change, they can learn how it can benefit them and find the desire to make the change.
**Knowledge:** The next step is to identify all the knowledge they're going to need to learn how to successfully make the change.
**Ability:** Ability involves the confidence and tools required to effectively gain the skills or behaviors intended because of the transition.
**Reinforcement:** The final step is reinforcement, which provides a follow-up process to ensure the change is permanent.

100% Word-of-mouth demand from ATL-area EMS agencies continues to grow. During Q1, our goal is to keep these EMS prospects warm so that when we cross the threshold for GA Case Rates, we can “turn the volume on,” as our payor partners will expect.

Existing GA EMS partners cover 17%/5.9M lives in Georgia. Including the agencies > 70% in our pipeline, we would cover 29%/6.2M lives. Including the entire pipeline, we would cover 44%/14M lives.

## Slide 19: Care Team - Navigators + Physicians

RIGHT SI+E

### What Happened
*   The Q1 priority is to reduce the cost/call (or time/call) by 10% while maintaining high quality on our stable volume of about 25 calls/day.
*   We now have a specific process map of navigation steps by call type. Last year, we treated all calls the same, but now we have enough experience to see that calls come in 4 major types: Clinically simple or complex, and Socially simple or complex. This has allowed us to focus on detailed steps that can be simplified to reduce variability and time.
*   We are also implementing a more refined rule-based matrix of which SDOH needs we will or won't solve for a given patient, over what period, and driven by the patient's insurance status. These guardrails are essential for the Care Team to keep us within the contracted time and scope of a RightSite episode.
*   While working to improve processes for the Navigators, we identified better ways to capture patient insurance cards. Our episodes' on-demand nature and 911 environment make capturing insurance information tricky. This area will get a lot of attention from the Care Team, the Revenue Cycle team, and Engineering.
*   We also improved our expense tracking system when RightSite pays for patient care

### What's Next
*   Continued focus on improving cost/call (time/call) and insurance identification
*   Measuring and experimenting to reduce diversion outcome variability across the physicians
*   Continued focus on improving expense tracking and how that will be connected to the RightSite Community Foundation reimbursement model

### Challenges
*   Capturing patient insurance IDs is tricky during RightSite's on-demand, emergent call environment
*   Credentialing physicians is slow because state agencies have no urgency to process physician applications that our payor contracts require
*   Call center-like environments are challenging to manage, as expected. Staffing, training, and culture continue to be our focus
*   Volume surges are hard on the team. It's stressful.

## Slide 20: Engineering

RIGHT SI+E

### What Happened
*   Product management and engineering focused on Q1 company priorities, specifically revenue cycle and episode efficiency ("cost per call")
*   Completed integration with the billing system, allowing syncing of patient insurance for claim filing
*   Initial integration with call center platform to manage recordings, which saved an estimated 10% of navigator time/episode
*   Advanced searching, filtering, and exporting capabilities were added to the episode list page
*   Selected and implemented Mode Analytics as the advanced analytics and reporting platform for internal and customer-facing reporting and started rollout to business users
*   Enhanced functionality for more accurate tracking of EMS crew members who utilize RightSite services, critical to the account management/behavior change strategies that drive call volume

### What's Next
*   Continue with the product management pipeline focused on revenue cycle and episode efficiency
*   Simplifying episode outcomes for better reporting to EMS partners and the health plans
*   Initial support for more automated SDOH navigation
*   Integrate with physician scheduling software for improved physician alerts about new calls
*   Integrate with an on-demand medical translation service to help patients with language barriers during intakes
*   Continue integration with the call center platform for additional features such as call notifications, navigator status, and managing pictures of insurance cards obtained from patients
*   Deeper focus on the phases of a patient's journey
*   Additional focus on Mode Analytics capabilities

### Challenges
*   Engineering capacity is limited to a 3-person team - this is a real bottleneck and we should consider adding an engineer now
*   The engineering team is also providing IT support to the business, which cuts into development capacity
*   Priorities can shift during the quarter, even when staying within the lanes of Company Priorities

*   Interviewed and made an offer to 2 additional part-time MDs; we now have 2 FT and 4 PT ER MDs
*   Successful open enrollment/benefit renewal effective 3/1
*   Two All-Hands meetings

### What's Next
*   Roll out performance review process
*   Begin quarterly 1:1 check-ins between non-direct-report managers and employees
*   Finalize job spec for the EMS “leader”, and build competency-based recruiting guides for upcoming interview(s)

## Slide 23: RightSite Community Foundation

RIGHT SI+E

The strategy for the RightSite Foundation is to pay for RightSite-referred services provided to uninsured patients (e.g., urgent care appointments, prescriptions, and rides). The uninsured represent about 20% of RightSite's blended rate.

### What Happened
*   IRS-approved tax status
*   Ramped up activities on Foundation description, donor collateral, donor identification
*   Data gathering on community-specific demographics and outcomes
*   Early outreach to donors
*   Avenue for health plans and hospitals to participate in serving their communities, using Hospital Community Benefit and Health Plan Foundation charity funds

### What's Next
*   Expanding fundraising strategy
*   Finalizing infrastructure (bank, insurance, website, etc.)
*   Finalizing descriptive content and process
*   Initiating community-level donor identification strategy (external vs. internal resource)

### Challenges
*   The donor community may be reluctant to fund a first-year foundation
*   Lack of full-time Executive Director leader
