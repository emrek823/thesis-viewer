*   $11.3K of Revenue was received in April but cleared the bank in May and is not reflected. April cash revenue was $105k
*   $11.5K of RCM cost was for all of 2024, we severed our contract with Coronis (RCM outsourced provider)

## Slide 12: Budget Notes
*   We are projecting on a FY cash basis to grow our revenue by ~3x from $756k to $2.2M, with a **December '24 run rate of $5.2M**
*   Our revenue is recognized on a cash basis, with a one-month delay for accounts receivable, aligning our financial reporting with actual cash flow
*   **Expansion Plans:**
    *   Raleigh clinic launch scheduled for July (projecting ~40 patients by year end)
    *   Houston clinic launch scheduled for September (projecting ~15 patients by year end)
    *   Los Angeles clinic growth: We anticipate our LA clinic will grow to ~60 patients by year-end. This represents a 2x increase from where we ended 2023, with growth being led primarily due to stronger insurance network coverage and strengthened relationships with referral partners (UCLA, Cedars Sinai and CommonSpirit)
*   **Cash Burn Considerations:**
    *   Corporate Hiring: To support the launch and growth of new clinics, we're expanding our full-time corporate team from 4 FTEs and 5 Part-time/Consultants at the start of 2024, to 18 FTEs & 6 Part-time/Consultants by year-end
*   Upside to this budget would stem from launching clinics in NYC and Ohio in 2024 (currently we are projecting to launch both in Q1 2025), as well as additional patient growth.
*   In 2025, we will build significantly on the 2 clinics launched in 2024 as well as open additional locations (NYC, Ohio, Arizona, Florida).

## Slide 16: Amae Recovery Tool and codified Level of Care transition criteria created with Amae psychiatrists to standardize care
**Amae supports members for life across the care continuum**

[Diagram: ENGAGE -> STABILIZE -> RECOVER -> PROSPER]
*   **ENGAGE**
    *   Post-Acute Engagement
*   **STABILIZE -> RECOVER**
    *   Intensive Phase
    *   Step-down Phase
    *   Maintenance Phase
*   **PROSPER**
    *   Life-long Support + Health Equity Solution

**To ensure consistent, standardized care as we scale, we are codifying criteria to inform LoC transitions in a data-driven manner**
**Design principles informing metrics:**
*   Impact (link to outcomes)
*   Clarity / simplicity
*   Objectivity
*   Consistency
*   Actionability

**Metrics and processes to be built in collaboration with expert psychiatrists**

*   **Dr. Scott Fears**
    *   CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER
    *   Division Chief, SMI @ VA || MD / PhD @ University of Chicago
*   **Dr. Gary Tsai**
    *   MEDICAL DIRECTOR, BEHAVIORAL HEALTH & SUD
    *   Director of Substance Abuse and Prevention Control @ LA DPH || MD @ UC Davis

**The metrics we define will be tracked and analyzed via Amae's developing tech stack**
*   Tech stack to be built on Palantir Foundry
*   LoC transition metrics to be tracked consistently, surfaced clearly for clinicians and leveraged to improve and standardize quality care

    *   Patient referral volume – securing agreements with health systems
    *   EHR Launch timeline, if we cannot set up our new EHR in time that may delay opening

## Slide 22: Houston, Texas
*   **Payor:**
    *   Optum Medicaid
    *   Will work on continuing conversations with Carelon (Anthem), Centene
    *   We are stuck and not progressing with Texas Blueshield

*   **Steps to date:**
    *   Awaiting final approval for contract with Optum for 3.1k attributed lives
        *   Up from expected 1k; will require a larger up-front investment, but translates to a larger opportunity for Amae
        *   Contract structure was approved: $300 PEMPM + FFS + 50% shared savings on TCOC
    *   Received investment from CommonSpirit (St. Luke's) on 5/6/24; venture team helping to drive forward referral partnership

*   **Other:**

    *   Amae has analyzed segment of the population to align on final attributed population
    *   May consider additional clinic locations in the future if warranted by 3.1k lives
*   **Risks:**
    *   Patient referral volume (can likely de-risk via PSA with St. Luke's or Memorial Hermann; less success contracting with BS of TX)
    *   Transportation logistics given wider net of attributed population from Optum
