**Tegus Client**
Hello, thank you for taking the time to speak with me today. I am reaching Veeva Systems. To start, could you give me a brief description of your background?

**Former Global Head of Commercial Excellence, Corporate VP at Actelion Pharmaceuticals**
Yes, I have a career with 23 years in pharmaceutical industry, covering different type of pharma companies serving primary care, specialty care, the last 15 years of my career in rare diseases. Most of my roles have been in commercial strategy and commercial excellence, which brings me into technology, CRM system and HCP engagement projects. I left the industry a year ago, founded my own company and I'm serving as a strategy consultant to life science companies.

What's important for our conversation is my global implementation of Veeva, which goes back into 2010 as a first biotech company in Actelion Pharmaceuticals, there you had a profound decision-making process to

choose Veeva as a partner of choice and globalized that. Within my consulting business, I'm always in depth in any discussions on CRM systems, AI next best action planning, big data analytics. So I think I still have a very good overview on the landscape.

**Tegus Client**
Yes, that sounds great. So as you look out today, what are your thoughts on Veeva? And how well do you think they are competitively positioned today? And if you're advising clients, when do you advise them to choose Veeva and for what products and when do you advise them to choose other things?

**Former Global Head of Commercial Excellence, Corporate VP at Actelion Pharmaceuticals**
Yes. So a little bit back on history, and you know the old days where CRM was pretty much driven by Oracle Siebel and other companies, which is probably 15 years ago. And then the revolution starts that you got a cloud-based system, which technology-wise is salesforce.com, which is the number one platform for any type of sales, transformations, sales interactions. Veeva was founded as a vertical of that. So specifically designed for the needs of pharmaceutical industry.

So salesforce.com was the technology always giving Veeva access to the latest CRM cloud-based technology, which we were exclusively used for life science industries. And life science is pharma, biotech, medtech now, so medical technology companies.

And Veeva tries to go a little bit broader into consumer business and into chemicals, which by far is not as big and as intense as utilization in pharma. If it comes to the market position, I would say, if you speak with 50 pharma companies, I'm pretty sure 45 of them are using Veeva. So it is a monopolist in this area.

And if you see how they started. So they started in commercial, having the classical customer relation management software, firstly, for sales then for more specifically key account management, when they launched something for medical science liaison, MSL people.

And then they moved along the value chain. So having a cloud where you have a lot of opportunities to store data, they next approached regulatory affairs in organizations, clinical development, quality. So starting from commercial, they go backwards in the value chain and are pretty successful with technology.

Having said that, at the same time, there is a big battle on being a data provider of choice, which brings me to IQVIA. So whenever you work in pharma, and you need address book and reference data for your customers so for the physicians. IQVIA acquired years ago, Cegedim's database on physicians, which is outside the U.S., extremely powerful. It's called OneKey. And it's still the reference for any data. So this is owned by IQVIA, and it's also publicly known lawsuit between Veeva and IQVIA on the utilization of this data.

So Veeva tried to get this data in IQVIA protected that. And to date, Veeva is building up their own data business. They call it open source. It's a competitive product to OneKey, but still not at the same level as you are based in the states, so pretty sure you're aware of the acquisition of Crossix in the states, which is also a data provider.

So you see the battle goes from heavy technology into providing data. And most recently, Veeva started to have a consulting business and having said that, it's not CRM implementation consulting. It's really business consulting, which is pretty small at the moment. But if you look into the openings, there are big plans to grow it very fast.

**Tegus Client**
I've been investors in Veeva for a long time. So I'm familiar with what most of what you are saying. On the consulting side, I know they're upping it. I would say how strategic customers think more broadly? Or do you think trying to compete with the likes of the systems integrators that would I advise you?

**Former Global Head of Commercial Excellence, Corporate VP at Actelion Pharmaceuticals**
So having really two decades background in pharma, you would never hire Veeva as a consulting company for strategic consulting or things like that. Simply, there is no brand. Veeva is technology and you use Veeva consulting to get the machine running very, very basic.

If it comes to strategy, you go to the Big Five, if you are a little bit more sophisticated and go to execution, you may consider this, but even IQVIA tried it, and it's hard to get a feet in the consulting business. And I consider that as byproducts on selling data and the services are following, but it's not a strategic priority from my point of view.

**Tegus Client**
That makes sense. And if you look at the current product set, I'm guessing when you brought Veeva into Actelion, you were really excited about it. Are you as excited about the product and the product set today or has the competitive landscape changed in any way? And is IQVIA able to change the game at all with their data?

**Former Global Head of Commercial Excellence, Corporate VP at Actelion Pharmaceuticals**
I don't think that you can replace the Veeva cloud offerings easily because they are already standard. And I even would say this business looks like a little bit commodity for me. So you can compare both companies, both offerings. There are a lot of new buzz words around. So IQVIA is talking about connected health or connected systems. In the end of the day, you have a CRM system, you have opportunities to work with artificial intelligence, which comes from outside.

So it's not something Veeva is developing. So they are partnering, and we have open-source mentality. So their system allows them to use any type of AI or machine learning capabilities. You find the same offerings on the IQVIA side. So I don't think that the gamechanger comes in. It's more, I think, the market share power to further penetrate the company.

**Tegus Client**
Okay. That makes sense. As you look, I think that I would agree, I think the CRM market itself is at least Core CRM is, I would say, clearly highly penetrated. And they've done a really nice job of extending even within CRM by coming out with new products and additional functions within CRM. And then on the Vault side, to me, that's really been then the great opportunity is for them, whether it's quality or regulatory, it's just so much on that side of the house.

But as you are advising people, are you seeing a lot of interest in new Veeva installations, not just for CRM, but just even for add-on products? Or are you finding that people have bought what they're going to buy. And it's a core system that everybody has, but people aren't adding a lot of new products.

**Former Global Head of Commercial Excellence, Corporate VP at Actelion Pharmaceuticals**
I would say from the commercial side, most of the people I'm working with are pretty much satisfied because basically, what you use today is somehow it's a proved e-mail. You have virtual sales calls. It's called Veeva Engage, this product. From a commercial standpoint, that's it. And then you have, for compliance reasons, the medical suite, which in the end of the day, it's exactly the same, just with a different color. So instead of orange, it's simply blue. Same functionality behind that, but of course, compliant.

And what's pretty new is the interest to have the 360 view on customers for pre-call planning. It's a feature it's called a timeline view, which allows to go back to history and people are asking for that to look into the past and predict a little bit the future. But it's one more module. And I'm also an investor in Veeva privately. My question is how the company strategically can grow without diluting the Core.

So I would say commercial is setter. Medical is a done deal. And now it goes more into data management, asset management in a cloud across different core functions in the pharma industry. I don't know how good they are penetrated beyond commercial and medical.

So I know from Actelion and now the spin-off is Idorsia, or I look into Janssen Pharmaceuticals, they pretty much made it into the R&D organization, into regulatory affairs, into clinical development. So that is having clinical trial data, doing electronical trial data, this type of things. I think it's the growing space for them at the moment.

**Tegus Client**
That definitely makes sense. One question that on the commercial side is, there's a lot of discussion on just as people move beyond -- because this is possibly for other reasons as well, I think there is an expectation that a lot of the big pharmaceutical companies are going to reduce the number of reps. That will impact Veeva as they do that. And I guess I'd love to just understand your perspective on what you're seeing with customers and what range of reduction you might expect over the next few years.

**Former Global Head of Commercial Excellence, Corporate VP at Actelion Pharmaceuticals**
Yes. So I think in general, you have to look into three different type of businesses. So on one hand, you have primary care, so GP business, you have specialty, and you have a rare disease, which is a type of super specialty business. So very concentrated. The few customers highly knowledgeable field force organizations, but only a few. If it comes to the number of Veeva licensees, there is a prediction in the market in the ballpark of 20% to 30% less reps post-COVID.

So it is, I think, significant for a company like Veeva. And this number is pretty much confirmed. So you can look into literature from McKinsey, from ZS, there are some data points which are always coming back to this range.

And it's harder, unfortunately, in the areas with less value-added from field forces, so in primary care because many of the interactions between an HCP and the patients are moving, especially in your country into telehealth, so basic consultation, patient interactions, and in this, you don't need primary care reps to provide information. So I think this entire business is the first to get digitized.

And on the other hand, there is also an upside on the Veeva. So whatever goes into approved e-mail into Veeva engaged into data management, next best action. You know that the Salesforce Marketing Cloud is partnered with Veeva.

So speaking for marketing automation, if companies need to wrap up and ramp up these capabilities on the other side is also a business, but I'm not aware how Veeva is pricing that because the model for the rep is easy. The rep is a license and the license multiplied with a number of reps. If you buy access to marketing automation and do this, I don't know how if they can compensate or not. I have doubts.

**Tegus Client**
Can you walk me through some of your doubts?

**Former Global Head of Commercial Excellence, Corporate VP at Actelion Pharmaceuticals**
Yes, for example, if you have a marketing automation solution. So I don't know if you get the general license as a company to do this. Or is it for the number of transactions, which are driven by marketing automation? Or is it around the number of people, departments who are working with the machine and activating that.

If it goes in the direction of transactions, then potentially much more digital transaction can compensate for a rep license over time. But I'm not sure what is the commercial model from Veeva because they never offered that to us until I was in charge of that. It's pretty new at first.

**Tegus Client**
And going back to your comments on the rep reduction to be in the 20% to 30% range, what would be your best guess? Is that the right range? Or does it have the potential to be higher?

**Former Global Head of Commercial Excellence, Corporate VP at Actelion Pharmaceuticals**
No, I think 20% to 30% is the right range. It might change by geography a little bit culturally. But I think also COVID was taken as an argument to look into more margins for pharma industry. And this is now an external trigger to look into the efficiency of your organization. And it's still an area there is a lot of effect in organizations.

And there are public announcements from Novartis, from Lilly, from other top 20 companies who already have started to reduce without official numbers. But if you stop one primary care organization in the space,

you're probably already in the range of one third of an organization.

**Tegus Client**
Yes. Do you think as the pharma companies reduce or focus on that margin, are there other areas that would impact Veeva as they look to bolster their margins? And as you look at customers total spending on Veeva, is that something that companies think about, oh, this amount of spending as a percentage of our total R&D regs getting to be really high. We need to reduce it. Or will the only pressure on Veeva really come from the rep reduction?

**Former Global Head of Commercial Excellence, Corporate VP at Actelion Pharmaceuticals**
I think the biggest thing comes from the rep reduction because the other things where you have data in the cloud master data management, you as a pharma company are likely to outsource that. You don't want to deal with the set.

And if you outsource it to a partner of trust, I think the hurdles to change an established partnership just for the price of minus 10%, for example, no pharma executive would take the risk to do that because it's always a matter of change management, unsecurity, if you're satisfied, you keep what you have. And for that, I think Veeva as an advantage on a strong market position not to get substituted easily.

**Tegus Client**
Yes. That definitely makes sense. And maybe we can just go through and go back with your experience at Actelion and just go through what the ballpark spend that Actelion had with Veeva and which products that you bought?

**Former Global Head of Commercial Excellence, Corporate VP at Actelion Pharmaceuticals**
Ballpark, so probably, it's seven-digits. So it was in the range between 1.2 and 1.5 in Swiss, which is 1.6 billion roughly in dollars per year, continued spend.

**Tegus Client**
Yes. And then which products did you all use at Veeva.

**Former Global Head of Commercial Excellence, Corporate VP at Actelion Pharmaceuticals**
Yes. So we had the CRM suite, we had proved e-mail we had Veeva engaged, we had Veeva Vault. And then we had something which is called DAM, it's digital asset management. So it's in the cloud product, which allows you to approve digital assets and make them available from the global perspective to regions and to the countries and you can follow any track changes in this one. So this is, I would say, an evolution of a promo world.

So then we had in a couple of countries Veeva OpenData. It was more a test to find a competitive product for IQVIA data. So we had a downside in Veeva, which was a weak analytic part. So we put for business analytics click view on top of that years ago, which is now an official partner of Veeva to compensate for that. We had the Veeva Medical Suite. And for commercial, we had the key account management module as Actelion rare disease is key account management through. So I think, if I remember that right, that's it.

**Tegus Client**
That's super helpful. As you were leaving, were there any new products you were excited about purchasing from Veeva, was there stuff in the pipeline that you know is perfect?

**Former Global Head of Commercial Excellence, Corporate VP at Actelion Pharmaceuticals**
No. What was happening is when I left, so we have been acquired by Johnson & Johnson and the Janssen Pharmaceuticals' CRM and they had a known CRM system, which technically is also Veeva that was customized and had a little different setup. So we operated in country clouds.

So that means every country could configure their environment as we needed for business, Janssen runs a

regional model. So one cloud for one region, which means if one country wants to change one field, all countries have to agree on that. So that's a different way of streamlining organizations.

And what came in from the Janssen side was a medical cloud, which is not a Veeva product, but which was connected as a self-service portal for HCPs and patients, the Veeva CRM system, but it came from a third party. So that was something very exciting Actelion jumped on it and good part of it.

**Tegus Client**
That definitely makes sense. Going back to your comments on AI, it's a complicated area to build out yourself because just finding the talent, I think it's hard. So on some levels you argue this, it's working with. But do you think that it will be necessary for them to do more of their own in-house AI and ML? Or can they get away working with other people?

**Former Global Head of Commercial Excellence, Corporate VP at Actelion Pharmaceuticals**
No, I don't think so because the next best action or AI on better customer profile and targeting segmentation works pretty well if you have a data landscape like you have in the U.S., partially in Canada. It's not really getting a lot of traction in Europe due to data privacy reasons and the inability to connect results with input data as granularity on physician prescriptions you cannot get.

So IQVIA is positioning themselves, of course, having the data that they use artificial intelligence to produce nominative HCP prescription level data by matching that. Because IQVIA owns a lot of patient data after we acquired Quintiles a while ago, sitting on the biggest part there, and I think there's no way to Veeva to compete with that. So I think they are better positioned if they allow pharma to use their artificial intelligence, machine learning provider at choice and then make sure that there is a seamless integration into the Veeva data environment possible.

I would expect, instead of developing it on their own, you acquire, I mean Veeva is significant company by size, making a lot of money. And if you want to have this capability, I think it's build or buy, I think it's more buy than build?

**Tegus Client**
Okay. I agree with that. And since people are already integrating these things in on the outside, there won't be a huge integration challenge if they decide to buy some of these.

**Former Global Head of Commercial Excellence, Corporate VP at Actelion Pharmaceuticals**
No. It works nicely when you see five, six different partners officially on the Veeva side, providing AI products, and all of them can be integrated. So I think the architecture of the Veeva environment is there to allow that.

**Tegus Client**
Okay. That was really helpful. If you look at your own experience at Actelion, but really other customers you are working with, what are some of the frustrations that people are having with Veeva right now?

**Former Global Head of Commercial Excellence, Corporate VP at Actelion Pharmaceuticals**
I would say one is definitely on the people's side. It sounds a little bit strange to you, but Veeva has an image as a revolving door. So people are quite quickly turning around. So joining the company, leaving the company, which doesn't speak for a good internal culture. Secondly, what I hear a lot from Veeva people and also from customers, there is an extreme pressure on getting sales numbers done.

So it moved more from a technology-driven customer-focused organization into a selling powerhouse, especially into cross-selling. And I think this is something not all customers appreciate.

**Tegus Client**
Yes. I would say if you looked at the Glassdoor or ratings on Veeva, your comments on the revolving door and the culture, I have wondered about it. So I actually really appreciate you saying that, as you look at

those comments and looking at their growth trajectory, do you think it impacts their ability to sell into customers? I think the challenge of every company once they get bigger. And I think you choose an interesting word at the beginning, when you've used as the monopolist. And I think they probably are a monopolist.

And I think when you get there, there's pros and cons to that, but are you finding that as you working with customers and they're looking at adding additional modules that they'll add them because they have to because it's Veeva or they add them because they're really excited about working with the company and it's the best technology out there.

And as you look at the growth opportunity of where your customers are spending their dollars, are they going to be able to continue to pull in the same share of incremental new dollars into new products that they have been?

**Former Global Head of Commercial Excellence, Corporate VP at Actelion Pharmaceuticals**
Yes. I think that is what I mentioned. So I think there are two risks in Veeva. One risk is this changing people and this changing culture. Secondly is their monopoly position because that requires to fast grow from a high platform. And I don't see where because customers are not buying every new gimmick just coming from Veeva. So every new model and having an additional license here.

I think business-wise, the pharma industry tries to make primarily the customer engagement model working better. And for that, there are more than enough tools available and already bought. What pharma will do is making much more use out of data and boiling that down and using that for customer profiling and then trying to get marketing automation in place to compensate for the reduction in field force organizations.

The second weakness I can see in Veeva is they had a clear primary flywheel. So as a CRM technology company, pretty much customer-centric and focused. And now they're getting pretty broad and big, and I would say also nimble and opportunistic. So question is how this dilution will impact their ability to grow. There is a nimble approach, you take whatever you can get everywhere, but you do it as a price to lose your core positioning.

So from the investor point of view, this is my personal opinion. I don't know what you think about salesforce.com and Veeva in this relation. And salesforce.com is much bigger than Veeva and they could replace Veeva easily.

In the lifestyle industry and offering much more and much better things starting from marketing automation, having Einstein as an AI engine. So the coexistence or the situation to have Veeva exclusively working in life science and Salesforce anywhere around it might be a question for the long-term, how sustainable that is?

**Tegus Client**
Yes. No, that's an interesting one. I know on the CRM side that at the formation that basically Salesforce has seeded certain areas that were very specific on Salesforce. I'm actually not as up to speed on whether that agreement still exists in the way it did at the time I did the due diligence, which is around the time where it was very much named.

And we don't own Salesforce anymore. And they actually are really refreshing their management. But most of my good source of information on Salesforce has left in the last couple of years. It's harder to get the answer to that specific question, answered in a way it was able to get that done at the time of the due diligence. So I think they may not have the same thing. Are you finding that you're advising customers to look at Salesforce more often?

**Former Global Head of Commercial Excellence, Corporate VP at Actelion Pharmaceuticals**
Yes. I'm doing that. And at least I can speak when I'm based in Europe in Switzerland. And I'm seeing intense activities from Salesforce towards the life science industry. If it is with executive webinars, if it is invitation to the Dreamforce. So it's not an uncharted territory anymore. And topics are pretty much the Veeva topics.

**Tegus Client**

And how would you say the products compare? I mean, it sounds like what you're saying is really Salesforce is becoming the more modern platform, and because they're investing in AI and ML across their own platform. Is that what you're saying? Is it just they're putting more investment in the core platform?

**Former Global Head of Commercial Excellence, Corporate VP at Actelion Pharmaceuticals**
If you want to have access to the new technology, probably Salesforce is the better one. However, pharma is the regulated environment, and all the Salesforce evolution comes more or less from consumer and from nonregulated business fields.

So Veeva has a big advantage that they understand the regulation and got workflows around the regulations or work within the boundaries, which Salesforce needs to learn, and pharma is a little bit skeptical on one hand, eager to get the technology, but on the other hand, not to train people how to play this in the regulatory environment, which differentiates Veeva and probably justifies the existence of both for the time being.

**Tegus Client**
That makes sense. Back on the rep side on commercial. To the extent of your knowledge, the rep reductions that you've seen in the industry today, where are we with that? The Novartis and Lilly announcements, are those cuts in the 5% to 10% range, 10% to 20%? Or has anybody made cuts in the 20% to 30%? Just wondering where we are on our way to maybe an eventual 20% to 30% reduction.

**Former Global Head of Commercial Excellence, Corporate VP at Actelion Pharmaceuticals**
We are on the way between 10% and 20% from what I know from colleagues in the industry. But of course, it's always nothing you find officially somewhere because, for instance, Novartis wouldn't say we had a reduction of the field force by 20%. So you will not find it in an annual report. But there is other evidence. So if you look into companies like IQVIA, ZS, McKinsey, Cross Health, they do a lot of market research with physicians and ask when on their expectations post-COVID in terms of customer engagement model.

And if you go across all therapeutical areas and physician specialties, it's roughly that they believe 60% of the interactions pre-COVID will be face-to-face. And that means either by sales rep or by Medical Sales Liaison people. So from the customer side, they expect a replacement of roughly 35% to 40% engagements through digital.

So on one hand, you have the figures what companies starting to do and then you have the customer expectations. And it looks for me like matching numbers and with this 30% as a max, you might be pretty good in forecasting difficult things.

**Tegus Client**
Yes. And it sounds like if we've made as an industry, if that's going to be your understanding, 10% to 20% of those reductions, we're well on our way there, already maybe even halfway to realizing that those ultimate reduction. Is that fair?

**Former Global Head of Commercial Excellence, Corporate VP at Actelion Pharmaceuticals**
Half or more. Yes.

**Tegus Client**
Okay. Interesting. And how that impacts relate to commercial relationships from a dollar perspective with Veeva, is it fair to say 20% to 30% headcount, a 20%, 30% reduction in Veeva spending and Veeva contracts? Is that oversimplified? Obviously, there's a lot of other CRM.

**Former Global Head of Commercial Excellence, Corporate VP at Actelion Pharmaceuticals**
No. I think you hit the nail, as Veeva operates with personalized licensees, it's very easy if you have 100 people and if you have 80 people, so you have 100 licenses before, after a reduction worth 80 licensees. But that probably has a swing until end of the year. So depending on when you do the reduction because usually, the renew of license is annually. So a license goes one year.

So whenever you reduce your organization, you will have to deal with the financial consequences. Because you will not terminate an existing one without compensating Veeva for that.

**Tegus Client**
Right. And when Veeva comes up for renewal and their customers may say a 25% reduction in their reps, how do you think Veeva will react to that? Are they going to be able to successfully push product to offset that 25% decline in contracts?

Do you think that they'll be successful in mitigating that financial impact either through raising prices or just anything at their disposal? Or would you expect your base case will see their CRM business effectively shrink by 20% to 30% over the next couple of years?

**Former Global Head of Commercial Excellence, Corporate VP at Actelion Pharmaceuticals**
No, I think it's very difficult to compensate that. So what I have seen for Veeva models are also, of course, discount levels. So depending on the overall volume you have with Veeva, and you hit certain tiers, you get a discount. And I think these type of things are difficult to compensate. So I think Veeva will bite the bullet and selling another feature to a smaller part of the field force organization will not compensate for that.

So I have doubts to tell you or to suggest that out of this 22%, 25% reduction, you can make 5% or 10% of that by offering different services. I don't think that's flying because pharma usually thinks in headcounts and related out-of-pocket spending. So if you reduce headcount and then your spending per headcount is going up on the other side is something CFOs will have a view on that in the budget process.

Okay. Just on clarifying the Salesforce point. So the two of them getting more competitive with each other. Are you talking about Core CRM? Or are you talking about small products and marketing. When you're saying I'm recommending Salesforce more, what specifically would be the overlap there with Veeva?

**Former Global Head of Commercial Excellence, Corporate VP at Actelion Pharmaceuticals**
Usually, it's the CRM basic cost you have. And when you have the features like approved an e-mail, you have the license potentially for my insights. You have a license for a key account management model. You have a license for both. And all of them are at least in my former days with Actelion have been charged by person. So the products I mentioned are impacted by that. So it's Core CRM plus commercial world.

And along the Salesforce questions, are you seeing any actual outright replacements of Veeva for Salesforce? Or where are you really pitching Salesforce? Is that the market that's left? Is it up-and-coming biotech?

**Former Global Head of Commercial Excellence, Corporate VP at Actelion Pharmaceuticals**
What you see, you have new entrants, you have U.S. biotechs that launched products in Europe or in Asia Pac. But most of the biotechs, I think are not making a lot of money on the Veeva because the organizational size is pretty small. Most of them are playing into specialty, rare disease and orphan drugs where you have limited numbers of probably worldwide 500 people or so max commercialized product in this area.

So that's not a big business for Veeva. It's interesting because they can support them also with Vault, but the scalability you have with the top 20 organizations is missing. And most of them only have one product. So I think that's not the big hope for growth, or I cannot see it.

**Tegus Client**
So what I'm trying to say is, I'm just trying to understand where specifically are you seeing people have interest in buying Salesforce in Life Science?

**Former Global Head of Commercial Excellence, Corporate VP at Actelion Pharmaceuticals**
Okay. I've seen that one of the big Swiss-based giants used the Salesforce platform, but customized that. So

I can see tendencies of some organizations to use Salesforce as a basic and then somehow do the Veeva vertical environment on their own. And there is one company I know of doing this.

And I think that's more companies who have in-house capabilities to develop this type of things. And they have been a little bit frustrated, but Veeva couldn't be customized in a way they needed it for their specific business.

**Tegus Client**
Got it. Do you think it's possible that Salesforce will actually take out some of the Veeva their customers? Or do you think the issue is really in new customers in biotech that they haven't gotten? That's really where the issue is?

**Former Global Head of Commercial Excellence, Corporate VP at Actelion Pharmaceuticals**
No, I think the issue is in the fight for new customers to, as I mentioned, transferring an organization from one partner to the other partner is the only thing what people want to avoid due to the entire change management. And when I was running field forces with 2,000 people, even if you change the color of a CRM system required one month training. And so you better not touch it if it's working. And only if you expect a real, real game-changing impact, it's worth to go through this change pain.

**Tegus Client**
And actually, as we're talking about this, I'm actually looking at the Salesforce. I actually do remember them doing something with Merck. Were they working with Merck and IQVIA as well? Did they put stuff together with IQVIA? And I'm trying to remember the story around that. Is Salesforce able to really come in and make the sale all by themselves? Or are they putting together with other partners?

**Former Global Head of Commercial Excellence, Corporate VP at Actelion Pharmaceuticals**
I think for me, it rings the bell, if you say, Merck and in Europe, Merck Sharp & Dohme, MSD, together with IQVIA. And that was probably even 10 years ago when they started to do multichannel marketing with a certain level of automation. I've seen it many times on conferences, saying that this is the new way to go, but I haven't heard any followers yet, successful ones.

**Tegus Client**
Yes. That's super helpful. In light of your view of the commercial business potentially contracting, why are you an investor? And maybe it's a long-winded answer, but what are the things that either may not be obvious to others or that you see ahead for Veeva that makes you excited enough that would maybe even offset a shrinking commercial business.

**Former Global Head of Commercial Excellence, Corporate VP at Actelion Pharmaceuticals**
I have my big bets into Crossix and this type of data and finding a way to build something similar ex U.S., so getting different data sources, which are mimicking Crossix and then doing triangulations with data and providing something on the data side. I think that's pretty strong, and I hope we will be able to do that. So for me, this is the area of growth for them.

And the second thing is I have seen they're providing services for specific therapeutical areas like oncology. So they have an opinion leader profiling tools for oncologists, which is a unique data set. And potentially, we are able to move that into other disease areas. So again, another example on being strong into the data landscape.

As you know that many pharma companies don't like to be dependent on IQVIA because they used their data monopole to excessively increase prices over the last 15 years and people desperately are looking for alternatives. So I see data as the big fee.

**Tegus Client**
And just to clarify on that second piece, what exactly are they developing for areas like oncology?

So for example, if I'm a biotech company, and if I would like to identify key opinion leaders in oncology across the world, there's a KOL, key opinion leader data set for oncology with profiling information, their activities in clinical trials with their publication patterns. So which is quite useful for somebody who wants to dive deep into these indications.

And most of the biologic products, which will be launched from today into the next years are all in immune-oncology. So having this type of data potentially differentiates and can get additional interest.
