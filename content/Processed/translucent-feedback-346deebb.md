Add groups after medical highlighted: Top tier business performance for health systems and medical groups starts with financial clarity at the service-line level.

Replace highlighted with generate: “Over time, this distribution creates a sticky customer base that can generate data for context engineering (not just supervised fine-tuning or RLHF) to improve the product over time. “

Replace highlighted with: Constitutes 50-60% of expenses

Replace highlighted with: “When analyzing CPT code performance in ASCs, prioritize non drug / testing codes and surface those codes that are high-priority for the service line”

Add comma after areas: We see parallels to Translucent in their early adoption, immediate enterprise ROI and quick up-sell motion in to adjacent service areas, and overall strong market pull catalyzed by technological and regulatory tailwinds.
