## Abstract

This study explores the impact of potential 340B eligibility expansion on the size of the 340B program.

A claims-level framework for 340B eligibility was constructed based on continuum of care – the concept that 340B hospitals and clinics could set their own rules to define which individuals are their patients and convert to 340B all of the drugs prescribed or delivered to those patients. Using a national sample of products, pharmacies, payers, providers, and patients, three scenarios for 340B eligibility were explored: an estimate of the status quo of the patient definition as well as two continuum of care scenarios.

Under the more liberal of the two continuum of care scenarios, the model estimated sales of branded products would increase by 103.7%, more than doubling. Expressed using 2022 sales, the value of branded, 340B drugs would increase from a baseline of $93.0B to $189.4B, dollarized using WAC (wholesale acquisition cost). There was a 10-fold variation in potential expansion across disease areas, with the largest expansion in areas like psychotherapeutics and ophthalmology in which patient care is often delivered outside of hospitals.

We also estimated 340B conversion rates: the estimated percentage of 340B-eligible product that was purchased at 340B prices. Estimates based on sales data showed that 92.5% of branded drugs had conversion rates above 40%, whereas more than 70% of generics were converted at rates below 20%. This raises questions about why 340B hospitals and clinics are choosing to buy discounted branded products but not generic drugs through this program. Further study may be warranted to understand the economic factors behind this behavior.

## Introduction

The statute that created the 340B drug discount program prohibits diversion of product to individuals who aren't eligible patients of the entity. HRSA released guidance called the patient definition in 1996¹ in an attempt to clarify this, but according to a study by the Office of Inspector General² there are inconsistencies in how this guidance is interpreted.

Since its inception, the 340B program has expanded in multiple areas, arguably enabled by a lack of HRSA statutory enforcement and profit incentives that enrich third parties without sharing discounts with patients, among other factors. As the program evolved, 340B product, which initially was available only at entity-owned pharmacies, began to be dispensed at commercially owned "contract" pharmacies, which ballooned into networks of retail and specialty mail pharmacies, the largest of which spanned hundreds of outlets. In addition, some 340B providers began converting prescriptions

written for their patients at external, non-340B providers as though the prescriptions had been written at the 340B provider, a process called "referral conversion"³. As justification, 340B providers pointed to the fact they were responsible for all of the healthcare costs of their patients, and thus should be able to convert all of those patients' prescriptions to 340B.

In 2020, manufacturers began to respond by implementing policies to restrict the use of contract pharmacies, which precipitated a series of complaints and appeals that are making their ways through the U.S. court system⁴.

### The Genesis case

Genesis Healthcare is a system of half a dozen community health centers based in South Carolina that participate in the 340B program. In 2017, Genesis was audited by HRSA, issued a diversion finding, and excluded from further participation in the program. HRSA's finding was based on Genesis converting to 340B its patients' prescriptions written at external providers such as physicians' private offices, which HRSA found was diversion. Genesis appealed, arguing that the 340B statute did not require the prescriptions of its patients to be written at its facilities. After a lengthy legal process, the case is currently in federal district court, which is expected to issue findings in late 2023 or 2024⁵.

The current study explores the impact of potential 340B eligibility expansion on the size of the 340B program. It builds upon a framework developed previously that defines 340B-eligible claims based on the patient definition⁶, studies the relationship between these claims and 340B sales to estimate 340B conversion rates, constructs a claims-level framework for eligibility based on continuum of care, and estimates the impact on the 340B program's size.

### 340B conversion

In the 340B program, conversion is the process by which pharmacy claims are determined to be 340B at pharmacies using virtual inventory and the replenishment model. The normal process in the supply chain is for the pharmacy to buy product, dispense it to an individual, and collect reimbursement, but for 340B pharmacies using virtual inventory and the replenishment model, the process is different. Currently, 340B pharmacies can be owned by the covered entity or not owned ("contract pharmacies"), in which case they're typically owned by for-profit organizations. In

the case of a contract pharmacy, the process usually begins as normal: the pharmacy buys non-340B product, dispenses it to an individual, and collects reimbursement. But if the 340B provider later decides to "convert" the filled claim to 340B, the contract pharmacy must pass on the reimbursement to the 340B provider. To make the contract pharmacy whole, the 340B provider buys replacement product at the 340B discount price, ships it to the pharmacy, and pays the contract pharmacy a fee, often based upon the "revenue" the prescription generated.

340B conversion is important because it impacts 340B revenue and because it can be used to detect diversion, where conversion rates exceed 100% of the estimated 340B eligibility. To our knowledge, data estimating 340B conversion behavior has not been published.

Studying 340B conversion requires understanding the relationship between sales and prescriptions, which is complicated by a handful of confounding factors including centralized warehouses, central fill pharmacies, product blocking, and timing issues, as illustrated in Figure 1. Centralized warehouses ship product to pharmacies; they don't fill prescriptions. They don't report shipments to IQVIA but the pharmacies they supply do report claims, which can skew the ratio of claims to sales. Central fill pharmacies are large, productionized factory environments that mostly fill maintenance scripts. If filled prescriptions are sent back to the original pharmacy, they're attributed to that outlet, whereas fills sent directly to patients aren't normally captured by IQVIA. In addition, the supply chain is a time-dependent process, and for 340B product there's a uniquely long time lag between sales and filled prescriptions compared to other types of pharmacy practice. For example, the time interval has been reported by NCPDP to be "as long as infinity, but most of the time within 90 days of the original claim transaction"⁷. Finally, product sales and/or claims may be blocked, which disturbs the relationship between sales and claims.

### Conversion behavior

Various factors and behaviors including economic considerations, claim visibility, and diversion may drive conversion above or below the predicted 100%. For example, it is believed some generic and low-cost branded claims are not converted to 340B because third-party administrator fees and the cost to purchase claims data make it unprofitable for 340B hospitals and clinics to do so. Also, pharmacies in vertically integrated corporations may not want to put their payer's rebate business at risk from 340B duplicate discounts and may refuse to provide claims data. A low level of conversion could also be due to coordination difficulties between contract pharmacies and covered entities. Finally, conversion rates may exceed 100% because of diversion, for example if a single claim is converted by multiple 340B providers.

### Continuum of care

"Continuum of care" is the notion that 340B hospitals and clinics are responsible for all medical care for an individual, and has been used to argue that all of the prescriptions of these individuals should be eligible for 340B discount pricing, no matter how attenuated the individual's relationship is with the 340B entity and its physicians. In contrast, according to the diversion prohibition in the law, only products prescribed or administered during care episodes at the 340B hospital or clinic may be 340B-eligible⁸(p5,2B).

Continuum of care includes referral conversions which have been used openly by 340B entities since at least 2018³. In a referral conversion, an individual visits an external, non-340B provider for care. Very often the external physician is a specialist and the prescriptions are written for specialty products, meaning there is a strong financial incentive for the entity to convert them to 340B.

## Methods

### Data

For the study of 340B conversion, the sample used self-administered products including branded and generic drugs, and spanning all disease areas, with a study period of 2021.

For the continuum of care study, both self-administered and physician-administered products were used. Only branded drugs were included since most generic claims, while 340B-eligible, are not converted to 340B (See Findings, pg. 8). The study period was 2022 Q4, chosen to be as late as possible so that the majority of 340B pricing had been restored given the contract pharmacy restriction policies in place by manufacturers at that time.

Pharmacy claims were sourced from IQVIA's Longitudinal Access and Adjudication Dataset (LAAD), while sales were sourced from IQVIA's DDD Subnational Sales database. Sales were dollarized using WAC pricing. Pharmaceutical products were grouped into disease areas following the Uniform System of Classification level 2 categories⁹, which groups products that compete in the same market.

### 340B conversion sample

To study 340B conversion, a sample of pharmacies was chosen having high capture of both claims and sales to control for the confounding factors described in Figure 1. For each pharmacy individually, a capture ratio distribution was calculated across a common set of 27,000 product NDCs, where the capture ratio was total unit volume (340B and non-340B) for claims divided by total unit volume for sales. Pharmacies with distributions near 1 were included in the sample.

### 340B eligibility based on continuum of care

To establish a patient-provider relationship, we determined the patient received care at the given provider within a period of 12 months. Any patient with

at least one medical claim in which the hospital or clinic was the billing provider was classified as a patient of that provider. In addition, any patient with a pharmacy claim in which there was an 80% or higher likelihood of the prescription being written at the hospital or clinic was deemed to be a patient of it. Likelihoods were calculated using the method described previously⁶. This second condition compensated in part for the fact the medical claims sample used has less than 100% capture.

Eligibility under the patient definition is illustrated in the left-hand panel of Figure 2 for self-administered drugs. Only prescriptions written at the entity and filled at its 340B pharmacies are 340B-eligible. The percentage of 340B-eligible prescriptions converted to 340B is the conversion rate.

    *   NON-340B PHARMACY (any pharmacy)

Two continuum of care scenarios, 1 and 2, are illustrated in the middle and right-hand panels of Figure 2. In the first scenario, prescriptions of the 340B provider's patients written at external, non-340B facilities can be converted if they're filled at the entity's network of 340B entity-owned and contract pharmacies. Scenario 2 is a more general case of the first, where all prescriptions of the entity's patients can be converted no matter where they're filled. For both scenarios, if an individual was a patient of multiple 340B hospitals and clinics, prescriptions could be converted by each one. This is less likely to occur for scenario 1 because it would require the pharmacy to be an entity-owned pharmacy or contract pharmacy of both covered entities. For physician-administered products, multiple conversions were not allowed since it would be difficult for entities to see each other's claims.

### Self-administered versus physician-administered

Drugs sales were classified as self- or physician-administered based on their distribution channel. This was done for summary purposes only and it did not impact our model. Sales in the retail and mail channels were considered self-administered, while sales in the hospital, clinic, and long-term care channels were physician-administered.

### Limitations

A handful of limitations apply to the current study.

Several factors may have caused us to under-estimate expansion under continuum of care. First, our sample has less than 100% capture of claims in the specialty mail channel. Second, the time period for establishing the patient-provider relationship was 12 months. This estimate may be conservative: the Morford letter¹⁰ suggests the period should be less than two years, and some 340B hospitals and clinics currently use a period of 23 months or even longer.

Our algorithm to identify patients of a 340B hospital or clinic is an approximation driven by a lack of publicly available data and the absence of clear government enforcement of the diversion prohibition.

Following the methodology used in our previous study⁶, orphan drugs were not removed from the data used for rural and free-standing cancer hospitals.

The 340B continuum of care model studied only branded products since generics are usually not converted to 340B.

Manufacturers' contract pharmacy restriction policies were not accounted for in our continuum of care model since policies vary by manufacturer and no public data is available. The study period for the continuum of care study was made as late as possible—2022 Q4—by which point we believe the majority of 340B pricing at contract pharmacies was restored.

Sales distribution channels segmented branded products into self-administered versus physician-administered segments. This approximation may impact the relative sizes of these two segments but not their combined size.

We did not account for white or brown bagging for physician-administered products.

## Findings

### Estimates of 340B conversion

A total of 23,429 pharmacies had capture ratio distributions centered near 1 according to the approach described in Methods, and were included in the 340B conversion analysis. This included eight of the largest retail chains. Specialty pharmacies were under-represented.

Using this sample, 340B conversion rates were calculated for the 53 brands and 1,633 generic drugs that had unit volume of at least 10,000,000 units in 2021, as shown in Figure 3.

Products from manufacturers with contract pharmacy restriction policies in place were excluded. Branded products were converted at a substantially higher rate: 92.5% of brands had 340B conversion rates above 40%, with an average conversion of 55.2%, while 70.2% of generics were converted at below 20%.

### Continuum of care

To estimate 340B growth under the two continuum of care scenarios, we calculated the ratio of 340B-eligible, branded claims for each scenario versus the estimated status quo under the patient definition. Growth estimates were converted to dollars assuming growth rates for sales would be the same as for 340B eligible claims. This assumes that historical 340B conversion rates would not change.

In 2022, $25.3B (7.8%) of branded, self-administered products were purchased through the 340B program. The continuum of care model estimated this would grow by 49.0% to $37.7B under scenario 1 and by 272.0% to $94.1B under scenario 2, as shown in Figure 4. For branded, physician-administered products $67.7B (32.0%) were 340B in 2022, which we estimated would grow 87.0% to $126.6B under scenario 2, as shown in Figure 5. Scenario 1 doesn't apply to physician-administered drugs since pharmacy networks aren't relevant.

The total growth of branded products was 103.7% for scenario 2, which would expand branded 340B sales from $93.0B (2022 estimate) to $189.4B.

9 | Double trouble: How expanding eligibility could double the size of the 340B program

340B expansion varied by a factor of 10 across different disease areas, as illustrated in Figure 6. The model estimated there was below average expansion in disease areas like targeted oncology, immunologic agents, and anti-arthritics which have a large number of specialty products, and average expansion in areas such as diabetes, respiratory therapy, and hemostatic modifiers (including anticoagulants) which are dominated by traditional products. The highest potential expansion was observed in psychotherapeutics and ophthalmic preparations in which patient care is often delivered in a non-hospital treatment setting and the individual may be a patient of the covered entity due to other medical needs.

The expansion also differed across covered entity types. For self-administered products under continuum of care scenario 1, 63% of the total expansion was driven by disproportionate share (DSH) hospitals, 16% by other hospital types, and the remaining 21% by federal grantees. This may reflect the fact that DSH hospitals have the most extensive contract pharmacy networks of any type of entity. For continuum of care scenario 2, where there was no restriction on where 340B-eligible prescriptions could be filled, the contribution to expansion from DSH hospitals dropped to 53% while the share for federal grantees increased to 35%.

## Discussion

The question of 340B eligibility has become increasingly important not only because of recent court challenges but because it impacts the amount of 340B discounts that are paid by manufacturers and received by 340B hospitals and clinics. There is data suggesting that patients do not receive these discounts, making 340B expansion an issue of profit capability for healthcare providers.

The current study has modeled the impact on the size of the 340B program assuming the 340B statute's diversion prohibition is no longer enforced, or stated another way, the current general understanding of the patient definition is replaced by a continuum of care framework. For continuum of care scenario 2 in which there was no constraint on where prescriptions were filled, the combined expansion for self-administered and physician-administered branded products was 103.7%. Applied to 2022 sales data, branded 340B sales would have increased from a baseline of $93.0B to $189.4B. Scenario 2 approximates an unlimited contract pharmacy potential, which is currently pursued by 340B hospitals and clinics in reform efforts due to the profit potential for these organizations and their for-profit partners. Based on prior research, unlimited contract pharmacies wouldn't likely be associated with lower patient out-of-pocket costs⁶.

The expansion in scenario 2, in which prescriptions can be filled at any pharmacy, was five times as large as the one in scenario 1 where fills were restricted to entity-owned pharmacies or contract pharmacies of the entity most likely to have generated the prescription. We believe this behavior is driven by the fact that although

contract pharmacy networks may overlap between 340B hospitals and clinics in the same geography, their entity-owned pharmacies are normally distinct. Thus, limiting fills to the network of contract pharmacies and entity-owned pharmacies of a single entity (scenario 1) likely restricts eligibility.

Potential expansion was highest for disease areas such as psychotherapeutics and ophthalmology in which patient care is typically delivered outside of a hospital setting, while growth was lowest for oncology. In recent years, many community oncology practices were acquired by 340B hospitals to grow 340B revenue¹¹,¹².

What would be the likely consequences if 340B hospitals and clinics had a limitless ability to convert individuals to "340B eligible patients"? The 340B statute's compliance measure (diversion) would be rendered meaningless, and without a new law to fill its place, ambiguity would increase and additional litigation could result. Manufacturers might decide to take individual diversion enforcement actions based upon the statute. Also, the impact on various stakeholders in the 340B program would be quite different. 340B hospitals and clinics would be able to increase conversion of claims to 340B sales, growing 340B revenue. In theory, this might allow them to increase budgets for uncompensated care or to pass on 340B discounts to patients. However, previous studies by our group have shown most patients do not receive a direct benefit from 340B discounts⁶ and the relationship between 340B participation and uncompensated care is uncertain¹³,¹⁴. Manufacturers could face increased costs and reduced margins, which could impact research and development budgets and slow innovation. Patients and payers, including employer groups, would face price increases if manufacturers attempted to offset losses by increasing prices elsewhere, such as by raising prices for launch products to compensate for future 340B discounts. 340B expansion would result in increased payer rebate disputes, which would raise costs (lower rebate retention) to commercial payers, plan sponsors/employers, and ultimately patients. 340B expansion would also likely increase state Medicaid costs (lowering rebate payment), and increase Medicare costs (lowering rebate payment). Consequently, taxpayer costs could increase in direct association with 340B expansion, and this warrants further study. Other stakeholders such as wholesalers, pharmacies, and third-party administrators that share in 340B revenue would likely benefit from expanded eligibility.

The current study also examined 340B conversion — the percent of 340B-eligible product purchased at 340B pricing — and found that the majority of 340B-eligible, branded products are converted to 340B while the majority of generics are not. This finding aligns with earlier studies that found that dispensing rates of generics were more than one third lower for 340B product versus all dispensed product at pharmacies¹⁵.

This has several potential implications. First, if 340B providers are able to generate 340B revenue from branded products but not from generics, it may create misaligned incentives that encourage these providers to use more branded products than their non-340B peers. This will have a negative impact on patients when their copays are tied to the list price. Second, it could improve access to branded drugs if 340B hospitals and clinics were willing to share 340B discounts with patients; evidence suggests this happens rarely⁶. Finally, it raises concerns about equity if manufacturers that make branded drugs are disproportionately supporting the program compared to generic manufacturers.
