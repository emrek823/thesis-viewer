# Slow Patient Recruitment in Clinical Trials

**Key Statistics:**
- Slow patient recruitment causes delays in **80%** of clinical trials.
- Only **50%** of subjects in a typical randomized controlled trial receive the experimental medicine. The other half in the control arm receive a placebo and/or another currently available therapy.

## Clinical Trial Phases

| Phase   | Description                     | Subjects        | Duration   | Cost   |
|---------|---------------------------------|------------------|------------|--------|
| Phase I | Safety                          | 100 healthy subjects | 1 year    | $7M    |
| Phase II| Efficacy                       | 500 subjects     | 2 years   | $20M   |
| Phase III| Efficacy + Adverse Events     | 3000 subjects    | 4 years   | $53M   |

**Success Rate:** &#x3C;10%

*Note: This document highlights the challenges faced in clinical trials, particularly focusing on patient recruitment and the associated costs and timelines for different phases of trials.*

The solution:
Use AI to generate
digital subjects
and enroll them
into control arms
of clinical trials.

# Document Content Extraction

## Typical Trial
| Description                          | Total Enrolled Subjects | Treated Subjects | Control Subjects |
|--------------------------------------|-------------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Trials with primary endpoints derived from intelligent control arms require up to 50% fewer subjects. |                         |                  |                  |

## Intelligent Trial
| Description                          | Decrease in Enrollment |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------|
| The cost required to recruit, treat, and monitor those extra subjects is our opportunity. |                        |
