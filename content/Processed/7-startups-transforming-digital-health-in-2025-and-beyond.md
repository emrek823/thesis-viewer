With the world almost at a standstill during this ‘new normal,’ medical startups have reinvigorated the discussion around how modern-day health solutions should look.

Apart from exposing gaps and vulnerabilities, the pandemic has also presented opportunities for health tech startups to jump to the forefront and showcase what they can do when the right mix of desire, innovation, and transformation comes knocking at the door.

According to data from CB Insights' State Of Healthcare Q3’20 Report: Sector And Investment Trends To Watch, just in the third quarter of 2020, healthcare AI startups have raised more than $2 billion in equity funding, across 121 deals, setting a new record for this sector. As digital health startups push the boundaries of technology and accessibility, we look at top 7 healthtech companies that are going to transform the industry in 2021 and beyond.

The proprietary operating system created by VillageMD, docOS™, connects with over a thousand clinical source systems with patient data, helping doctors truly leverage the power of AI by analyzing millions of data points and assisting in better decision-making. With access to advanced analytics and health expertise, VillageMD physicians use insights to manage patient needs.
