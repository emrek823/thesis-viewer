### Gregory Field’s Lasso Success Story

- Rocketship exit - trying to figure out the magic: story, technology, right timing
- Background from CrossX (data analytics) and AppNexus (product management) before both sold
- Applied clinical data knowledge to create scalable, compliant healthcare data products
- Built core HCP targeting product with 50% lower costs, processing in seconds vs 2 weeks
- Real value: end-to-end platform approach
	- Modular products: audience builder, analytics module (SaaS to pharma), monetization for publishers
	- “Everything for everyone” - unlocked advanced features while passing savings to customers
- Profitable from day one, COVID accelerated digital transformation and budget shifts

### New Company: Real-World Data Analytics for Clinicians

- Evolution of previous work - building RWD analytics for providers instead of pharma
- Serving insights to improve practice across multiple dimensions:
	- Clinical gaps and patient outcomes
	- Administrative drivers: save time, reduce costs, increase RVUs
	- Benchmarking: “Am I top decile for knee replacements in Georgia?”
	- Referral analysis: competing against new hospital marketing spend
- Agentic, autonomous, personalized approach at scale
- Clinical use cases: no guidelines for rare disease combinations but can show peer treatment patterns and outcomes
- Administrative benchmarking similar to Translucent’s physician productivity work

### Healthcare AI Market Observations

- Pharma commercial focus growing vs preclinical discovery
- Point solution vs platform consolidation coming
	- Scribes/voice AI facing commoditization pressure
	- Need workflow expansion or face race to bottom on pricing
- Hospital adoption rates accelerated dramatically
	- 3-5 weeks from intro to contract vs 18 months previously
	- C-suite mandate for AI adoption creating “collective FOMO”
	- Buying based on product roadmaps due to rapid AI development pace
- Early innings of AI platform shift - low hanging fruit being captured first
- Network effects and compounding data advantages becoming key differentiators

### Next Steps

- Gregory to connect with Mark next week at Purple Lab office
- Emre pushing Mark to release Purple Lab API for portfolio companies
- Sean and Gregory to get beer in Austin
- Gregory offered to help with Westlake real estate questions
