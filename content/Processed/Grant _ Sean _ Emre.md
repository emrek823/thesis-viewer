### Background: Grant’s Experience

- Built camera systems and drones in high school
- Studied Mechanical Engineering before switching to D&D program (CS focus)
- Built products independently rather than lab work
- Worked at GoogleX doing computer vision for AgTech team
- At Rippling, scaled from no code to 4 separate SKUs generating millions in revenue each

### Origin Story & Problem Discovery

- New doctor on Upper East Side discovered dangerous iron levels through unique blood panel
- Required to donate blood 1x/week to manage ferritin levels
- Found himself youngest person by 30 years at blood centers
- Identified disconnect: Blood centers desperate for donors while people pay for lab testing
- Conceived idea to combine blood donation with biomarker testing

### Market Testing & Validation

- Ran 4 blood drives with New York Blood Center at Lifetime Fitness
- Marketed as “free blood testing for blood donation” to test concept
- Achieved 80 donors on a single Saturday in August
- Identified key friction points:
	- Location accessibility is critical barrier
	- Blood donation not top of mind for most people
	- Current outreach (10x weekly calls) ineffective
	- Unless habitual, people forget about donation as an option

### Target Customer Segments

- Good Samaritan Bucket:
	- People who want to help but need additional motivation
	- Interested in health metrics but need convenience
- Biohacker Spectrum:
	- Committed biohackers currently paying for solutions
	- “Biohacker curious” - read Bryan Johnson, former athletes
	- Won’t spend $600+ on random products but interested in health data
	- Potential to convert through freemium model

### Blood Center Partnership

- Secured contract in 3-4 months (faster than expected)
- Partner is second largest in country with 120 locations
- Initial launch in San Francisco
- Expansion potential:
	- Santa Barbara
	- Pittsburgh
	- Denver
- Value proposition to centers: New donor acquisition
- Centers provide infrastructure for mobile blood drives

### Business Model & Vision

Act 1:

- Focus on blood center contracts and donor conversion
- Build playbook for multi-city expansion
- Raised small pre-seed from Comma
- Currently raising $4M to build team and support launch

Act 2 (Future Vision):

- Only company with direct throughline of biomarker data + EHR + blood samples
- SoHo (Substance of Human Origin) Marketplace potential:
	- Blood centers
	- Plasma fractionators
	- Biobanks
- Core value: “You don’t know if something is improving if you aren’t measuring it”
