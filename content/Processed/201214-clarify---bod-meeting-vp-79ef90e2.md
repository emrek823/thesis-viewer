## Slide 8: QUALITY – Clarify analytics driving patients' decision-making in choosing top quality hospitals in Cigna's network

QUALITY – Clarify analytics driving patients' decision-making in choosing top quality hospitals in Cigna's network

(Image of CIGNA CENTERS OF EXCELLENCE 2021 METHODOLOGY document)

**Patient outcomes data sources**
For 2021, we assessed the quality of care of the treatment provided for the 18 surgical procedures and medical conditions shown in Tables 1A and 1B using measures of patient outcomes derived from publicly available, hospital self-reported data and claims data. The dataset was sourced from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Medicare fee schedules, and Clarify Health Solutions' (Clarify) proprietary commercial dataset (Commercial, Medicare Advantage, and Managed Medicaid) representing 40 million, and 120 million+ annual lives, respectively, across all 50 states and the District of Columbia (DC). We used the reporting period of January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2018.

Each quality metric is risk adjusted by comparing the sample observed score to the Clarify expected score, computed from their clearinghouse of commercial and government paid claims data and using proprietary calculation models. In rare instances where Clarify models do not converge, a national average becomes the comparator to the sample observed score. After risk-adjustment, scores for complications, HAI and mortality rates are combined in a weighted average manner. Resulting scores in each data set are combined using a volume weighted average, and are then split to create two peer groups for teaching hospitals vs. non-teaching hospitals.

**NewYork-Presbyterian**
"This data is great and we've been using it at all levels in our organization. I shared some Clarify analyses with the Chair of Radiology at Columbia and now he wants to include it in a presentation he's working on for the Dean"
– Financial Director

**Cigna**
The team realizes the power of the data available in Clarify, so there is a lot of demand for using this for our contracting analysis which is the reason for the increased asks over the last few weeks.
– HealthSpring Mid-Atlantic and Pennsylvania Markets

**MEMORIAL HERMANN**
"We took this data to Feby (Chief Strategy Officer) and I wanted to let you know we've communicated how much value you have created for this organization in such short amount of time. We're going to introduce this data to the Board next. It'll be the first time they have seen this sort of data.
– Director of Strategy

**Cleveland Clinic**
This tool is way more intuitive to use than anything I've seen before. We've historically struggled with end-user adoption due to ease of use.

**Humana**
What you [Clarify] produced will present very well to the MA Market leaders and serve as directional food for thought until insights on Humana trend savings are available.

Ingredient 1: Intuitive information architecture and navigation

*   **Move from visualization-driven to entity-driven navigation**
    *   I want Hackensack Meridian PCP performance, not tools to go find it
*   **Focus on insights, not capabilities**
    *   Who are my best performers? Worst? Where do I have the most opportunity?
*   **Anticipate the next question - drill through to any level of detail, but easily find your way home**
    *   Unless they can see the detail under this, my provider partners won't trust it
*   **Find the common patterns**
    *   Distill navigation patterns required across all of our products into a master pattern to minimize bespoke developer work

## Slide 16: Ingredient 2: A flexible configuration framework

Ingredient 2: A flexible configuration framework

*   Build tools to allow Clarify to easily configure new screens and metrics
*   Developers concentrate on reusable components
*   Product managers can configure more and more of their own content and workflows with a growing number of UI tools
*   Implementation teams can iterate on customer configuration with less need for Product or Platform

**Is it working?**
*   Customers are buying
*   Producing product-specific content at 6x the rate we could at the beginning of the year
*   Clarify Referrals implementations down from 12 weeks to 2-3 weeks

Impact: Moments from the team

**Winning a street fight**
"You guys way outshine Crimson Market Advantage. I love how transparent your methodology is.”
– Senior Strategy Team Member, Hackensack Meridian Health

**Hitting the mark on customers' needs**
"It's like you guys were literally in my brain!"
– Sr. Director, Network Analytics, Cigna®

"What I've told others looking for a new market and referrals platform is that if you're okay with inconsistent estimates, there are a lot of products out there. If you want 90% accuracy in insights, use Clarify"
– SVP of Strategic Initiatives, JOHN MUIR HEALTH

**Unlocking long-needed change**
"This is simply just amazing work. I haven't had access to this kind of data in the 10 years I've been in this space. It's all been anecdotal. I'm both scared and excited to see what I'm about to find!"
– Director of Children's Services, MEMORIAL HERMANN

**Accelerating patient impact**
"This is a gamechanger for us! Now we can accurately gauge protocol feasibility and not waste time pursuing physicians who don't treat patients who actually qualify for the trial. We need to share this with headquarters.”

## Slide 40: Results: Diversification for scale and sustained growth

Results: Diversification for scale and sustained growth

**Key Takeaways:**
*   Significant shift from reliance on advisor and team referrals in FY-20 to 80% of pipeline generation driven by Sales and Marketing efforts in FY-21
*   Advisor and team referrals still convert at healthy rate, so should remain in the demand gen formula in FY-22
*   Stronger Marketing/ Sales/ SDR collaboration across programs
*   Upsell/Cross-sell has the strongest conversion => key focus area in FY-22 as customer base expands

**Chart 1: Open Pipeline by Source (FY-20)**

| Opportunity Source Category | Percentage |
| :-------------------------- | :--------- |
| Marketing                   | 14.38%     |
| Referral                    | 12.91%     |
| Sales                       | 52.23%     |
| Upsell/Cross-sell           | 20.49%     |
| **Total**                   | **100%**   |

*Sales, Marketing, and Upsell <50% (This is incorrect, Sales+Marketing+Upsell is 14.38 + 52.23 + 20.49 = 87.1% in FY-20)*
*(Self-correction: The <50% refers to Marketing and Upsell only if Sales refers to a different category, but the breakdown implies that 'Sales' here is distinct from 'Marketing'. If "Sales, Marketing, and Upsell" is a collective term, then the 87.1% is correct. Let's assume the chart label refers to a specific subset of the pie, e.g. "Marketing and Upsell" which is 34.87%, making it <50%. Or "Sales" is what's referred to as "Sales Outbound" from previous slide. Given the context of the bullet points about "Sales and Marketing efforts", it's likely a mislabel in the graphic's text, or it implicitly refers to Marketing + Upsell + a specific Sales channel, but not all 'Sales' category. However, I will just transcribe what is explicitly stated.)*

**Chart 2: Open Pipeline by Source (Implied FY-21, based on takeaways)**

| Opportunity Source Category | Percentage |
| :-------------------------- | :--------- |
| Marketing                   | 39.92%     |
| Referral                    | 11.05%     |
| Sales                       | 30.71%     |
| Upsell/Cross-sell           | 18.32%     |
| **Total**                   | **100%**   |

*Sales, Marketing, and Upsell >80% (39.92% + 30.71% + 18.32% = 88.95%. This matches >80% for Sales, Marketing, and Upsell).*

**Marketing sources:** Events, Search, Webinars, Email, Online advertising

## Slide 52: Deals closing 25% quicker in FY21 (3–4 mo.) vs. pre-FY21

Deals closing 25% quicker in FY21 (3–4 mo.) vs. pre-FY21
Have reduced average sales cycle length by over a month in FY21 vs. FY20 and earlier

*   Payer sales cycles still longer than other segments though carries largest ARR
*   Provider has shortest cycles (declining each quarter as carryover deals from FY20 closed earlier in the year)
*   Expecting shorter cycles Q4 cycles for Life Sciences deals that open and close quickly; seeing fastest Upsell cycles in Life Sci and ~100 days to close New logos when excluding outliers

## Slide 61: FY22 customer growth and key metrics

FY22 customer growth and key metrics

*   Solution maturity and refined go-to-market strategy driving healthy sales rep productivity
*   Expect above average net retention as we continue to penetrate existing customer base with low churn

Note: FY2022 metrics use a notional gross margin of 75%; ARR = Annual Recurring Revenue (cumulative across years); Bookings = ARR plus one-time fees for implementation and professional services (cumulative within year)
