Initial Series A goals (July 2021)

Email to Vamos (Mar 2022)

Overview for Conversation with Erik:  No expectation from the beginning that you would be delivering care for general audience today (see below)

While we give you credit that you’ve met all the milestones associated with MVP build (“June Investor Update We’ve met all milestones associated with our MVP product build”) we’ve consistently emphasized that this is not a focus in the early days.

Underperformance to-date

Switch in D2C strategy

Hiring - not able to mobilize strong team

BEHIND SCHEDULE

General struggles (Feb 2022 update): “While we have made our first hire, we have been unable to close key candidates for Product. Erik will be leading our product roadmap through 2022 but we will continue to meet with candidates and if the right one crosses our path we'll try to bring them in. This is no longer a critical dependency but any leads are welcome.”

Daniel (CMO): Daniel did not pass initial interview process; Erik indicated that he was not sufficiently qualified yet hired Daniel ~1.5-2 months later without any advance communication to investors.

Advisory board (strong emphasis in initial Series A goals): Feb 2022 update We have invited several women to join our advisory board but have been unable to secure any commitments. We would like help in finding advisors with D2C marketing and growth experience.

Waitlist: 150 people on waitlist in March, which is lower now pre-launch

BEHIND SCHEDULE

As of June 12th, we have 110 CA residents on our waitlist. Our goal is to obtain 500 CA resident signups by the start of beta. We intend to grow this number through digital engagement and in-person events in the L.A. area.

In general, expect <5% will convert to initial users; retention drop off thereafter (e.g. beat 60% by end of M3).

Customer acquisition strategy (Care Model and Operations Doc): Where is any evidence of this?

HOW/WHY was this not thought through PRE-pivot? We did not say anything at the time but we observed – this is/was UNACCEPTABLE.

Starting in May 2022, we will begin developing a customer acquisition strategy which will allow us to begin various experiments that will enable us to build a sizable patient waitlist. We will leverage the following for content distribution. A patient waitlist is important because in July we will invite the first 100 patients and expect to have rolling invites after initial beta launch (i.e. invite 50 new patients every week there after)

Website SEO

Google Ads

Paid Social

Influencers

Community Based Organizations (partners/ advertising)

Trials & Promo Programs

Referral Programs

PC - struggling with timing now for things that were 100% under your control. Only launching in CA now

BEHIND SCHEDULE

Feb 2022 update: Barring any setbacks we will have two PCs setup giving the ability to deliver care in three states: California, Washington, and Texas by this summer. We are planning to launch an invite-only beta for July 2022”

Heatmaps: In Series A milestones → “Once initial geo market(s) is identified create tactical market breakdown of communities within respective regions (e.g. heat maps around foot traffic, churches, grocery stores, etc.)”

Family strategy: Focus in Series A milestones → where is evidence of this? Or communication of why this is no longer a focus?

BEHIND SCHEDULE

Going out to raise now with lukewarm reception

Coral Health

Been trying to raise for 6-7 months even with close probability to sign 1-2 employers with 50K+ lives

7/27/21 Objectives from SD

FWIW here is the 12 month ‘game plan’ that I laid to Erik yesterday:

Seed Objective (up to $3M): create the basis for strong company foundation within 12 month timeframe in order to then raise >$20-25M to support company scale. In some, I continue to believe that we need to identify initial market & GTM, demonstrate an ability to identify, engage and cultivate individual/family/community trust, and begin cultivating early provider network and signing up docs. We can then go contract w/ payers who will need to see an adequate provider delivery network and that early members are actively engaged.

The below bullets represent a high-level outline towards use of funds with initial capital needs (up to $3M):

Advisory Buildout

Identify, engage and mobilize top tier advisory group — Latinx, clinical, population health and commercial/BD.

Design Core Management Team Phenotypes by Position (

Latinx Population Health (Mariza?)

Bus/Corp Dev to identify markets

Med Mgmt/CMO

Provider relationships—how do we get the providers to sign up with our MSO?

Staff model or IPA model?

Mkt knowledgeable requirements

Payor relationships

In general, confirm conversations w/ prospective core mgmt team members (e.g. who is  in warm/advanced stage?)

Cultivate Deep Understanding of the Latinx Community

Identify bottoms-up Latinx community (social, behavioral and clinical) needs and how we best serve a variety of needs initially.

Validate promotor de salud model and understanding of the persona phenotype.

LatinX Family dynamic as an Advantage. Let’s revisit but in short I see a significant opportunity to serve and appeal to a multi-generational family compositions. A few considerations include:

Adding re-enrollment into the product. Then we could go back to Centene and say we have the ability to identify members that you cannot find! That in itself is highly valuable to plans.

The tech must be able to gather population health and family-level visibility; a few considerations: 1) existing health IT platforms are patient-centric not family-centric and 2) how do we collect data that will not be covered by HIPAA? For instance, if an aunt has active tuberculosis where do you catalog this information? All of this privacy information is beyond HIPAA.

Once initial geo market(s) is identified create tactical market breakdown of communities within respective regions (e.g. heat maps around foot traffic, churches, grocery stores, etc.).

Building the Zocalo Delivery Network

How much virtual vs need for bricks/mortar (do not underestimate this latter need). A clinic will be the most expensive, easiest-tp-build and commoditized part of this build. Likely not the best use of initial capital and/or time.

MSO—staff or IPA? How to insure most med mgmt control?

Full risk or pro-fee risk or FFS initially

Clinics/centers

Product Build

Family/Social/Community-based product is essential early. What’s different here? Community & social (e.g. community health workers) — prove that we can engage this community in a unique way and can do so over the long-term (acquire customers, engage early, etc.). It’ll be critical that initially we stay flexible on product but think through challenges around engaging this Latino community and engendering deep trust.

Architect beta product; initial focus on identifying and engaging Latinx community members

Outline our buy-vs-build game plan re: early product development

Payor Contracting (should be easier once you pick a mkt and then get the physicians signed up)

Is this a commercial, Medicare Adv (Duals), Managed Medicaid or Medicare — suspect it will be all of them.

If focus initially on Managed Medicaid, we will need early team member that understands respective buyer maps and has deep network relationships. If Medicaid is initially our focus then understanding the sales & marketing playbooks to Medicaid plans will be essential and we’ll likely need “scar tissue” from those that know how to sell into Managed Medicaid plans.

Corp structure re: MSO and Corp Practice of Medicine (CPOM) issues in the target mkt

Identify friendly physician for this (I’d immediately engage you with counsel at Foley & Lardner and/or McDermott)

Apply for NPIs with plans

March 2022 Update for Vamos

Marcos → Erik: Ultimately, what has the team accomplished over the last 7 months that can give mgmt/us confidence around nailing our beta and subsequent go-live?

User Research – Understanding key assumptions/research

A primary concern of ours is that there has been a lack of sufficient user research that would inform the below pillars to the business. 7+ months in we would expect to see the type measurable and qualitative user/customer feedback that would directly inform key aspects of the business. Which assumptions and/or data is driving key business decisions?

Care Model & Scope of Services – What is our product?

What are the core services Zocalo will offer in beta/go-live? These care services directly inform various care pathways/workflows, product development roadmap (buy-vs-build), regulatory/compliance (dependent on types of clinicians required, prescription, insurance related matters, etc.).

GTM / User Acquisition – Who are our customers and how have we validated?

Plan of attack: Put simply, what is the general plan of attack here? Frankly, I expected a defined D2C GTM strategy in place prior to making the pivot into the existing D2C direction. Yet, we still have not seen any semblance of clear, coherent GTM strategy.

Channel Validation: What is the plan in place for customer acquisition at scale after the beta? The customer acquisition strategy for September needs to be in place today, and then can be later informed and tweaked by what is learned during the beta.

User Phenotype: Who specifically is the ideal user for this product/solution? Upper-middle class Latino millennial? Individual right above Medicaid threshold with high-deductible plan? What is the plan for bringing in the family unit?

Business Model & Unit Economics – What are we charging? How much will it cost? While this won’t be perfect and ironed out during the beta, what information/data is informing this?

To be fair, Erik has done a good job of collecting market comps re: pricing.

That said, in my experience with these D2C virtual care delivery models, it is important to understand the direct & indirect costs incurred by the specific users you are serving / selling to which then inform our pricing model.

And, tying to the above ‘User Phenotype’ bullet, there is currently a dislocation between who their perceived user is (~30 y/o Medicaid mother of 2 earning $30K annual income) vs a user who could plausibly pay $15-25/mo out of pocket.

Additionally, since we do not yet understand what our basic MVP care model is and/or will comprise, we cannot make any credible claim on how much it will cost to deliver care to an individual user. ~90 days out from beta we should have much of this in place today.

//

Evidence: Ultimately, what has Erik accomplished over the last 7 months? We’ve seen a pricing comparison, which is a nice consulting project. Primary research potentially, but always referred to vaguely. Here is some evidence from us, but multiple other angel investors and advisors have consistently asked what is Erik even doing? Does he even know what he’s doing?

In general, we have no confidence in Erik’s ability to comprehend essential / basic elements of his business and in his ability to make the correct decisions on behalf of Zocalo.

To be clear, this is not an attack on Erik’s character – instead his ability as CEO and to lead/build Zocalo.

Record of self-qualifying, hedging and excuses. Body language consistently poor.

Misleading since diligence / wiring: SD to add

D2C Pivot. Within 1-1.5 months of wiring Erik pivoted to current D2C strategy and clear very little-to-no pre-analysis was made; in many ways it felt like this was an ‘easier pathway’ yet no concrete strategy or execution plan.

Scope of services: 7 months in, Erik struggles to define what the offering for Zocalo even is. Rather than taking ownership, he is still planning on punting until 2022 to better understand what CMO wants

PC setup in each state and licensing: No contingency on anything else the company is doing, and there is still a chance that this will delay the beta. Why? No reason

Customer acquisition: “Punting until April”. Who is the customer? Is it latino millennial? Patient on medicaid? For a D2C business, this lack of understanding of who the exact customer is and how to target them is shocking. Difference between knowing the community (knows this very well) and who’s the customer for his business

Allocating his time appropriately: Spending 3 days for Rogers board meeting, Rock Health CEO Summit, Yale Healthcare conference. What other CEO does this pre-launch?

No ownership: Showed us these user stories / personas and it was Mariza/others who built these and he mentioned that he gave them a hard time for that. You are the CEO

Market Feedback.

Next steps. Erik still has a very important role in the company, just not a CEO.

Erik still has role at the company (for now); relieve him of ‘all duties’ and put him in best position of strength (e.g. in market telling Zocalo story, branding, etc.).

Find CEO-in-waiting (call them COO or whatever)

Aequitas to help find an operator to run the business:

Erik is relieved and we work with him to bring someone on:

Erik leaves the company

Warning for Erik and he steps up his game exponentially (very very doubtful and that is why it’s so low).

What good looks like for other D2C healthcare companies?

WellTheory / Ellen - experimentation, prioritization, customer understanding, clear vision
