### Brian and EG Foundation Models Overview

- Brian Daley - fastest Columbia graduate, currently working as quant at SIG, 5+ years ML research including at NASA
- Co-founder Peyton - math genius, met first day at Columbia scholars program (both got likely letters and research funding)
	- Originally planned Math PhD, traveled world together, now building EGRA
- EGRA building EEG foundation models
	- Core thesis: thought will be next interface for human-tech interaction
	- EEG as modality has potential to bring this to broader consumer base
	- Applications span clinical neurodiagnostic side and consumer wellness

### Technology Foundation and Differentiation

- Academic breakthrough: recent paper on EEG foundation models trained on only 60,000 hours of public data beat all downstream benchmark tasks
	- Previous approaches used narrow models for narrow cases/datasets
	- Foundation model approach “blows everything out of the water”
- Current implementation:
	- Containerized the open model weights from Reeve paper (Representation for EEG with Versatile Embeddings)
	- Created inference provider endpoint
	- Model generalizable across different electrode configurations, patient types, sampling rates, duration
- Competitive landscape: Pyramidal doing similar EEG foundation models, just signed Cleveland Clinic partnership
	- Pyramidal is clinical-backed team focused on seizure detection
	- EGRA differentiation: consumer focus for speed advantage

### Go-to-Market Strategy and Data Acquisition

- Initial approach: clinical partnerships to prove better patient outcomes
	- Target outcomes: better seizure detection, sleep staging, Alzheimer’s detection, neurodegenerative diseases
	- Goal: partner with one tier-one healthcare clinic network (Cleveland Clinic equivalent)
- Consumer data strategy if clinical moves too slow:
	- Pay students $5/hour to wear EEG headbands while doing homework
	- Target: create largest corpus of thought-to-text EEG data
	- Additional use cases: athlete performance monitoring, sports wellness applications
- 6-12 month milestones:
	- Acquire 500K-1M hours of EEG data through consumer devices and healthcare clinics
	- Secure one tier-one healthcare clinic partnership
- Revenue model: paid API for post-trained downstream tasks (sleep staging, etc.) plus fine-tuning services

### Funding and Investment Process

- Originally focused purely on compute costs when thinking about investors
	- Learned VCs provide much more value through expertise and connections
- Current round: $5M at $25M pre-money valuation
	- Already have term sheets reflecting this valuation
	- Significantly oversubscribed - could raise much more if stacked together
	- Prioritizing strategic investors with healthcare expertise and relevant connections
- Looking for partners who can provide:
	- Deep healthcare expertise and connections
	- Long-term strategic support as company grows
	- Quick decision-making capability

### Next Steps

- Emre to call Sean in the morning and provide update
- Emre targeting 10%+ ownership stake, flexible on exact terms
- Brian expecting response before noon Sunday given quick timeline needs
