Big questions

Scalability / replicability of Apollo

Feedback

Interest level is high and most of the conversations are how do we scale, how do we differentiate, and what is our competitive advantage

Patient acquisition and that playbook - how do you replicate this across other centers and sites

Playbook with partnership / JV approach looks very different. Building a playbook to work with any local provider with existing patient base or assets that cna help accelerate our growth trajectory.

Deliberately chose APollo b/c of their aggressive expansion across the country. Launch multiple centers over the next few years .

Beginning to think about OSH, other IPAs, ChenMed. B/t the 4 of us - Apollo has been a unique relationship with cultural

Cultural specific - good entry point but how do you quickly expand beyond that

We believe this is actually a huge tenant the future business taht we want to build. 1st center is to prove this out in concentrated geography / demographic we know well. Produce playbook for culturally focused PACE to launch to new groups and ethnicities

Application process and applicability of that process and are you at an advantage b/c you’ve gone through it once

Technology - What are the real proof points? What does that translate to?

Common data spec and quality measures to get into organizations so we don’t have to knock on people’s doors to get in there

Not

Is PACE the winning the model here? Duals, MA, managed medicaid

Makes the most sense from an entry point

PACE is very much a stepping stone - business to be built on culturally focused PACE programs, PACE can inform whatever a future model for home and community based model for seniors

Trajectory, margins, growth ma

20-30% margin - any further, the government will breathe down your neck.

Flesh out more

What does future of this company? Where does this get us?

Most of the thinking around that (internally vs. more external)

Run as fast as we can to raise a significant amount after to really accelerate and expand. What are the pieces we need to hit in 2025 to do that

1st center operating at fully capacity

Proof points around GTM and technology in context of our operations. Pretty complete platform with demonstrated capabilities

Alternative Care sites

ADHC and converting to PACE

JV structures to allow us to have many centers in addition to our own

Amount $15-$20

$20 allows us to pursue other routes

Engaging with NCB to understand debt to augment tihs round

$10M on PACE operations - $5M on real-estate, $5M on capital losses

Tech side - run fairly lean operation with $5m for next 2/2.5 years

Star Dance Studio

Intus - 2x revenue per customer in addition to the tech.

Logistics

Decks / context over next 1-2 weeks

$2m from Apollo

What convos have been best?

Define dove really deep really quickly and liked them the best

Flare - only quick discussion. Very immediately he got it

X

Martin Ventures - came from Sebastian intro; ADHC to PACE make a lot of sense; how do you pull that off? Execute really well over last 15 years. More of a PE shop

Competitive advantage

Tech

Culturally advantage

Future proofing this model - what this looks like with a lot of devices

ROI snowball

Application playbook

Inorganic options

Too early but we need to be thinking about here

Edenbridge - sitting with them for a 3rd time next week to understand alignment

In a bind due to fundraising and have 2 centers coming online

Intus - want to be in position to acquire them at some point

Real estate

Paul Galees - stepping
