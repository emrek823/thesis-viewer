# ZoomLogi Pre-Call Briefing | Jan 2026 MBR

Call Date: Jan 8, 2026 (12pm PT) Attendees: Olivier, Saad, Sean, Emre Context: Monthly Business Review for Dec '25

## 1. Executive Summary

One-liner: ZoomLogi is executing on plan with $270K ARR, 2 paying logos live, and 3 more going live in January. Q1 pipeline looks solid with 7 high-confidence deals against a 10-logo target.

State of Business:

ARR: $270K (76% of Dec target, up from $0 in Aug)

Paying Logos: 2 live (Beacon Bio, Cardinal Health), 3 starting Jan (Progress Pharmacy, Minaris, Verily)

Runway: $3.5M cash, 2+ years at current burn (~$140K/mo)

Team: 6 FTE + 2 contractors + 1 intern; Enterprise AE hired (starts Mar 2)

Key Developments Since Nov:

Progress Pharmacy signed ($100K+ ACV) — largest ACV to date

Minaris signed ($60K ACV) — first CDMO logo

Enterprise AE hired for Health Systems/Specialty Pharma vertical

New advisor: Ex-Head of Tech Ops @ Kite Pharma (Gilead)

Website refresh live: zoomlogi.com

JPM swag campaign: 9 VIP prospects received tracking-enabled gifts

Watch Items:

Verily slipped to Jan (7+ month sales cycle — longest ever)

Pipeline cleaned from 67 → 53 opportunities

Head of Eng still open (critical Q1 hire)

4 closed-lost in Dec including Catalent (product gap)

## 2. Performance Trajectory (Aug → Dec '25)

### Revenue & Logos

Trajectory Assessment: Revenue growing steadily but logo velocity is the constraint. Need to convert 8 more logos in Q1 to hit 10-logo target. Pipeline has 7 high-confidence deals — tight but achievable.

### Burn & Runway

Burn Assessment: Burn increased $127K → $140K with new SWE hire in Nov. Runway comfortable at 2+ years. 2026 plan targets $80K/mo net burn by Q4 with revenue scaling.

### Pipeline Health

Pipeline Assessment: Headline number dropped (67 → 53) but this is cleanup, not deterioration. Proposal volume up (8 → 13). Quality improving — 7 high-confidence deals in Q1 funnel.

## 3. Q1 '26 Pipeline Deep Dive

### High Confidence Deals (7)

Total High-Conf ACV: ~$315K (if all close)

### Medium Confidence Deals (3)

### 2026 Logo Targets by Quarter

Gap Analysis: Currently at 4 logos (2 live + 2 signed). Need 6 more in Q1 to hit 10. Pipeline has 7 high-confidence + 3 medium = 10 possible. Thin margin for error.

## 4. Strategic Context

### What's Working

1. AI Calling as Differentiator Every recent customer conversation highlights AI calling as the "wow" factor:

Logmore: "Really cool... could work without people noticing it's AI"

Sanofi RLT: "Really promising... really great"

DJ (ex-Takeda CGT): "That's wild. It's like talking to a person"

McKesson (Nov): "That AI calling was pretty awesome"

2. Specialty Pharma Wedge Emerging

Progress Pharmacy signed ($100K+ ACV) — largest deal

UIC Specialty Pharmacy has quantified pain (2 days/week manual POD work)

Cardinal Health's top 5 delivery locations are specialty pharma (Accredo, CVS, etc.)

Enterprise AE hired specifically for Health Systems/Specialty Pharma

3. Cardinal Expansion Flywheel

2nd team added to platform in Nov

Volume +50% MoM

Inbound call automation live (30-40 daily FedEx calls)

Top delivery locations are specialty pharma = expansion path

### What's Challenging

1. Enterprise Sales Cycles

Verily: 7+ months (longest ever) due to bottoms-up Google process

Scholar Rock: Internal NDA/vendor gating, wants sandbox to avoid formal process

Arvato: GDPR + GDP validation concerns before pilot

2. Sophisticated Buyers Harder to Sell

Boston Medical Center: "Everything is automated... flows into our EMR pharmacy system"

Fresenius Kabi: Already has Rate Links TMS with carrier APIs

3. Product Gaps Causing Losses Catalent closed-lost due to missing:

Track SOP per customer (upload/store SOPs)

Case management (SOP templates when issues occur)

Pre/during/after shipment guidance

4. Head of Eng Still Open Critical Q1 hire. Switched search firms (Quantum → Slope). Candidates in funnel from Slope, SingleSprout, GC.

### Competitive Positioning

From vault analysis (2026-01-05-zoomlogi-vs-general-logistics.md):

ZoomLogi vs. General Logistics (Project44, FourKites)

Key Insight: "Cardinal Health tried FourKites unsuccessfully in other business units." Generalists fail on pharma depth. ZoomLogi's edge is vertical specialization + AI intervention, not breadth.

Moat-Building Priorities:

Publish ETA accuracy metrics (P44 leads with "99%")

Build carrier-side value (P44's two-sided marketplace)

Productize downstream visibility (Cardinal's customers → pull)

Workflow automation creates switching costs

## 5. Questions to Probe

### On Q1 Execution

Verily: What's actually blocking? Is this a vendor assessment process issue or champion strength? Who's the economic buyer?

ALK Pilot: $120K ACV is material. What's the pilot success criteria? Who signs off after 60 days?

Logo Velocity: 6 logos needed in Q1, 7 high-confidence in pipeline. What's the fallback if 2-3 slip? Any acceleration levers?

Progress Pharmacy Go-Live: $100K+ ACV is largest deal. What's the implementation timeline? Any risk of delay?

### On Team & Hiring

Head of Eng: This has been open since Aug. What's the blocker? Is comp competitive? How many candidates in final rounds?

Enterprise AE (Mar 2 start): What's the ramp plan? Which accounts will they own? How does this change Saad's focus?

Engineering Capacity: With 2 FTE engineers + contractors, is there enough capacity for Q1 product roadmap (Transport Provider Alerts, Chain of Custody downloads, AI workflow builder)?

### On Product & Competitive

Catalent Loss: They wanted case management features. Is this a one-off or pattern? What's the roadmap priority?

ETA Accuracy: The competitive analysis flags this as a gap. What's ZoomLogi's actual ETA accuracy? Should this be published?

Yard Management: FourKites has full suite, P44 has basic. Dock scheduling impacts temperature excursion risk. On roadmap?

### On Strategic Positioning

Specialty Pharma vs. CGT: Progress Pharmacy and UIC suggest specialty pharma as a wedge. Is this the new ICP focus or still CGT/CDMO?

Cardinal Expansion: Top 5 delivery locations are specialty pharma. What's the expansion motion? Who owns that relationship?

Series A Timing: 2026 plan shows Series A "expected" in Q3. What's the trigger? $2M ARR? 20+ logos? Lead investor cultivation?

### On Closed-Lost Patterns

Natera (chose competitor): Who did they choose? What capabilities did competitor have that ZoomLogi didn't?

Enterprise Sophistication: Boston Medical and Fresenius Kabi were "too automated." Is this a disqualification signal or feature gap?

## 6. 2026 Scorecard Checkpoint

From the Nov MBR, here's the 2026 execution scorecard. Check progress:

### Q1 Targets (by Mar 31)

Overall Q1 Assessment: Tracking but tight. Biggest risks are Head of Eng hire and logo velocity.
