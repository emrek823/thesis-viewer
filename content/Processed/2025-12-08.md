### HealthMC Product Performance Update

- Current burn: ~$175K/month (maximum forecasted)
- Team reduced through RIFs, focused on AI research and data ops
- Platform improvements delivered significant results:
	- 98% recall, 90s precision on AI performance
	- ROI models showing 8-10x returns on customer data
	- Inference costs dropped 98-99% (V0: $3/chart → V2: 2 cents/chart)
	- Fixed data ops issues causing 10% chart loss (high-value charts)

### Active Customer Contracts

- Render contract signed: $50K installation + 10% of value found
	- Processing 16K patients through year-end
	- Handshake agreement to move off Credo paper if successful
	- Conservative model: $500K value = $100K total payment
- Kieran ongoing discussions with Nate Amak (Chief Population Health Officer)
	- Strong ROI presentation, evaluating integration needs
	- Competing against internal AI builds
- Gather and PCC contracts continuing into next year

### Payer Market Research Strategy

- Conducting product research calls (not direct sales pitches)
- 40 outreach attempts → 20 calls (10 completed, 10 scheduled)
- Key insights emerging:
	- Cost reduction focus vs. revenue generation
	- Interest in DRG detection (overbilling prevention)
	- 5% chart review requirement resonates with payers
- Blue Cross Blue Shield NC showed interest in broader applications

### Financial Projections & Runway

- Current revenue finishing ~$750K (mix of recurring and one-off)
- Conservative projection: $1.5M ARR by mid-2026 from Render + Kieran
- Runway extends through October 2026 at $0 operating margin
- Pricing model: $50K platform fee + $0.75/encounter
- Cost structure: 2.5 cents inference + 1-2 cents human QA = 80%+ margins

### Go-to-Market Questions

- Platform proven, clear customer value demonstrated
- Remaining challenge: building robust commercial pipeline
- Sales cycles: 18-24 months for payer contracts
- Two hiring priorities when revenue supports:

### Next Steps

- Judah: Continue product research calls with payers and payviders
- Sean: Will intro to Kieran CFO if timing makes sense (no immediate outreach needed)
- Virtue team: Provide payer contacts for product research discussions
- All: Reconvene in person (JP Morgan conference timing) to assess fundraising readiness

### Portfolio Company Updates

- 32 Murals: Decent position, needs 1-2 major contracts
	- $2.5M convertible note, runway not material concern
- Anna: Exceptional performance, preempted with $17.5M Series A term sheet
	- Closing before year-end
	- Board member with full financial access
- Clara: Worst performing company on list
	- Need significant improvement
- Mural: ~$20M bookings expected by year-end
	- Ahead of pace, limited visibility on details
- Integral: Strong business growth
	- Started year at $500K, ending between $6-9M ACV
	- Term sheet expected this week/next
- Solstice: Strong momentum with contracts signed in last 90 days
	- Series A fundraise planned January/February
- Zoom Logic: Good progress, fine contract acquisition
	- High Series A interest for next year raise
- Valley Steer: $1.5-2M top line revenue
	- Sufficient for Series A if chosen

### Right Site Concerns & Valuation Approach

- Major underperformer burning >$800K monthly vs minimal revenue
- Raised ~$25M total, at “put up or shut up” phase
- Recommendation: Write down to cost (not full write-off)
	- Proactive, responsible GP approach
	- Flag as concern for LP conversations
	- Still has 8-10 months runway

### Market Valuation Discussion

- Current portfolio appropriately valued, nothing “aggressively frothy”
- Market seeing high Series A prices (Translucent: $105-100M after 6-7 months)
	- Series B at $500M-1B range
- Most GPs taking frothy marks during current period
- Agreement to intervene if marks become unrealistic vs value

### Recent Investment Activity

- Prudential closed: Now $17.5M Series A at $75M post
	- No follow-on investment planned
- Hermes: Received $4M SAFE term sheet at $18M post
	- Original investment: $500K at $5M post (lowest price pre-seed)
	- Accelerated process to close before holidays
	- No additional investment expected

### Next Steps

- Sean: Compile spreadsheet with portfolio company metrics
	- Cash position, runway, revenue/ARR, qualitative updates
	- Leverage upcoming portfolio calls and board meetings
	- May need to request Mural financials directly
- Dave: Review cash position next week for distribution decisions
	- Payroll impact on available cash
	- Frank Rimmerman may request company financial statements for validation

### Portfolio Company Updates

- 32 Murals: Decent position, needs 1-2 major contracts
	- $2.5M convertible note, runway not material concern
- Anna: Exceptional performance, preempted with $17.5M Series A term sheet
	- Closing before year-end
	- Board member with full financial access
- Clara: Worst performing company on list
	- Need significant improvement
- Mural: ~$20M bookings expected by year-end

- Zoom Logic: Good progress, fine contract acquisition
	- High Series A interest for next year raise
- Valley Steer: $1.5-2M top line revenue
	- Sufficient for Series A if chosen

### Right Site Concerns & Valuation Approach

- Major underperformer burning >$800K monthly vs minimal revenue

- Market seeing high Series A prices (Translucent: $105-100M after 6-7 months)
	- Series B at $500M-1B range
- Most GPs taking frothy marks during current period
- Agreement to intervene if marks become unrealistic vs value

### Recent Investment Activity

	- No follow-on investment planned
- Hermes: Received $4M SAFE term sheet at $18M post
	- Original investment: $500K at $5M post (lowest price pre-seed)

### Next Steps

- Sean: Compile spreadsheet with portfolio company metrics
	- Cash position, runway, revenue/ARR, qualitative updates

### HealthMC Product Performance Update

- Current burn: ~$175K/month (maximum forecasted)
- Team reduced through RIFs, focused on AI research and data ops
- Platform improvements delivered significant results:
	- 98% recall, 90s precision on AI performance
	- ROI models showing 8-10x returns on customer data
	- Inference costs dropped 98-99% (V0: $3/chart → V2: 2 cents/chart)
	- Fixed data ops issues causing 10% chart loss (high-value charts)

### Active Customer Contracts

- Render contract signed: $50K installation + 10% of value found
	- Processing 16K patients through year-end
	- Handshake agreement to move off Credo paper if successful
	- Conservative model: $500K value = $100K total payment
- Kieran ongoing discussions with Nate Amak (Chief Population Health Officer)
	- Strong ROI presentation, evaluating integration needs
	- Competing against internal AI builds
- Gather and PCC contracts continuing into next year

### Payer Market Research Strategy

- Conducting product research calls (not direct sales pitches)
- 40 outreach attempts → 20 calls (10 completed, 10 scheduled)
- Key insights emerging:
	- Cost reduction focus vs. revenue generation
	- Interest in DRG detection (overbilling prevention)
	- 5% chart review requirement resonates with payers
- Blue Cross Blue Shield NC showed interest in broader applications

### Financial Projections & Runway

- Current revenue finishing ~$750K (mix of recurring and one-off)
- Conservative projection: $1.5M ARR by mid-2026 from Render + Kieran
- Runway extends through October 2026 at $0 operating margin
- Pricing model: $50K platform fee + $0.75/encounter
- Cost structure: 2.5 cents inference + 1-2 cents human QA = 80%+ margins

### Go-to-Market Questions

- Platform proven, clear customer value demonstrated
- Remaining challenge: building robust commercial pipeline
- Sales cycles: 18-24 months for payer contracts
- Two hiring priorities when revenue supports:

### Next Steps

- Judah: Continue product research calls with payers and payviders
- Sean: Will intro to Kieran CFO if timing makes sense (no immediate outreach needed)
- Virtue team: Provide payer contacts for product research discussions
- All: Reconvene in person (JP Morgan conference timing) to assess fundraising readiness

### Portfolio Company Updates

- 32 Murals: Decent position, needs 1-2 major contracts
	- $2.5M convertible note, runway not material concern
- Anna: Exceptional performance, preempted with $17.5M Series A term sheet
	- Closing before year-end
	- Board member with full financial access
- Clara: Worst performing company on list
	- Need significant improvement
- Mural: ~$20M bookings expected by year-end
	- Ahead of pace, limited visibility on details
- Integral: Strong business growth
	- Started year at $500K, ending between $6-9M ACV
	- Term sheet expected this week/next
- Solstice: Strong momentum with contracts signed in last 90 days
	- Series A fundraise planned January/February
- Zoom Logic: Good progress, fine contract acquisition
	- High Series A interest for next year raise
- Valley Steer: $1.5-2M top line revenue
	- Sufficient for Series A if chosen

### Right Site Concerns & Valuation Approach

- Major underperformer burning >$800K monthly vs minimal revenue
- Raised ~$25M total, at “put up or shut up” phase
- Recommendation: Write down to cost (not full write-off)
	- Proactive, responsible GP approach
	- Flag as concern for LP conversations
	- Still has 8-10 months runway

### Market Valuation Discussion

- Current portfolio appropriately valued, nothing “aggressively frothy”
- Market seeing high Series A prices (Translucent: $105-100M after 6-7 months)
	- Series B at $500M-1B range
- Most GPs taking frothy marks during current period
- Agreement to intervene if marks become unrealistic vs value

### Recent Investment Activity

	- No follow-on investment planned
- Hermes: Received $4M SAFE term sheet at $18M post
	- Original investment: $500K at $5M post (lowest price pre-seed)
	- Accelerated process to close before holidays
	- No additional investment expected

### Next Steps

- Sean: Compile spreadsheet with portfolio company metrics
	- Cash position, runway, revenue/ARR, qualitative updates
	- Leverage upcoming portfolio calls and board meetings
	- May need to request Mural financials directly
- Dave: Review cash position next week for distribution decisions

### HealthMC Product Performance Update

- Current burn: ~$175K/month (maximum forecasted)
- Team reduced through RIFs, focused on AI research and data ops
- Platform improvements delivered significant results:
	- 98% recall, 90s precision on AI performance
	- ROI models showing 8-10x returns on customer data
	- Inference costs dropped 98-99% (V0: $3/chart → V2: 2 cents/chart)
	- Fixed data ops issues causing 10% chart loss (high-value charts)

### Active Customer Contracts

- Render contract signed: $50K installation + 10% of value found
	- Processing 16K patients through year-end
	- Handshake agreement to move off Credo paper if successful
	- Conservative model: $500K value = $100K total payment
- Kieran ongoing discussions with Nate Amak (Chief Population Health Officer)
	- Strong ROI presentation, evaluating integration needs
	- Competing against internal AI builds
- Gather and PCC contracts continuing into next year

### Payer Market Research Strategy

- Conducting product research calls (not direct sales pitches)
- 40 outreach attempts → 20 calls (10 completed, 10 scheduled)
- Key insights emerging:
	- Cost reduction focus vs. revenue generation
	- Interest in DRG detection (overbilling prevention)
	- 5% chart review requirement resonates with payers
- Blue Cross Blue Shield NC showed interest in broader applications

### Financial Projections & Runway

- Current revenue finishing ~$750K (mix of recurring and one-off)
- Conservative projection: $1.5M ARR by mid-2026 from Render + Kieran
- Runway extends through October 2026 at $0 operating margin
- Pricing model: $50K platform fee + $0.75/encounter
- Cost structure: 2.5 cents inference + 1-2 cents human QA = 80%+ margins

### Go-to-Market Questions

- Platform proven, clear customer value demonstrated
- Remaining challenge: building robust commercial pipeline
- Sales cycles: 18-24 months for payer contracts
- Two hiring priorities when revenue supports:

### Next Steps

- Judah: Continue product research calls with payers and payviders
- Sean: Will intro to Kieran CFO if timing makes sense (no immediate outreach needed)
- Virtue team: Provide payer contacts for product research discussions
- All: Reconvene in person (JP Morgan conference timing) to assess fundraising readiness

### Portfolio Company Updates

- 32 Murals: Decent position, needs 1-2 major contracts
	- $2.5M convertible note, runway not material concern
- Anna: Exceptional performance, preempted with $17.5M Series A term sheet
	- Closing before year-end
	- Board member with full financial access
- Clara: Worst performing company on list
	- Need significant improvement
- Mural: ~$20M bookings expected by year-end
	- Ahead of pace, limited visibility on details
- Integral: Strong business growth
	- Started year at $500K, ending between $6-9M ACV
	- Term sheet expected this week/next
- Solstice: Strong momentum with contracts signed in last 90 days
	- Series A fundraise planned January/February
- Zoom Logic: Good progress, fine contract acquisition
	- High Series A interest for next year raise
- Valley Steer: $1.5-2M top line revenue
	- Sufficient for Series A if chosen

### Right Site Concerns & Valuation Approach

- Major underperformer burning >$800K monthly vs minimal revenue
- Raised ~$25M total, at “put up or shut up” phase
- Recommendation: Write down to cost (not full write-off)
	- Proactive, responsible GP approach
	- Flag as concern for LP conversations
	- Still has 8-10 months runway

### Market Valuation Discussion

- Current portfolio appropriately valued, nothing “aggressively frothy”
- Market seeing high Series A prices (Translucent: $105-100M after 6-7 months)
	- Series B at $500M-1B range
- Most GPs taking frothy marks during current period
- Agreement to intervene if marks become unrealistic vs value

### Recent Investment Activity

- Prudential closed: Now $17.5M Series A at $75M post
	- No follow-on investment planned
- Hermes: Received $4M SAFE term sheet at $18M post
	- Original investment: $500K at $5M post (lowest price pre-seed)
	- Accelerated process to close before holidays
	- No additional investment expected

### Next Steps

- Sean: Compile spreadsheet with portfolio company metrics
	- Cash position, runway, revenue/ARR, qualitative updates
	- Leverage upcoming portfolio calls and board meetings
	- May need to request Mural financials directly
- Dave: Review cash position next week for distribution decisions
	- Payroll impact on available cash
	- Frank Rimmerman may request company financial statements for validation

### Portfolio Company Updates

- 32 Murals: Decent position, needs 1-2 major contracts
	- $2.5M convertible note, runway not material concern
- Anna: Exceptional performance, preempted with $17.5M Series A term sheet
	- Closing before year-end
	- Board member with full financial access
- Clara: Worst performing company on list
	- Need significant improvement

### HealthMC Product Performance Update

- Current burn: ~$175K/month (maximum forecasted)
- Team reduced through RIFs, focused on AI research and data ops
- Platform improvements delivered significant results:
	- 98% recall, 90s precision on AI performance
	- ROI models showing 8-10x returns on customer data
	- Inference costs dropped 98-99% (V0: $3/chart → V2: 2 cents/chart)
	- Fixed data ops issues causing 10% chart loss (high-value charts)

### Active Customer Contracts

- Render contract signed: $50K installation + 10% of value found
	- Processing 16K patients through year-end
	- Handshake agreement to move off Credo paper if successful
	- Conservative model: $500K value = $100K total payment
- Kieran ongoing discussions with Nate Amak (Chief Population Health Officer)
	- Strong ROI presentation, evaluating integration needs
	- Competing against internal AI builds
- Gather and PCC contracts continuing into next year

### Payer Market Research Strategy

- Conducting product research calls (not direct sales pitches)
- 40 outreach attempts → 20 calls (10 completed, 10 scheduled)
- Key insights emerging:
	- Cost reduction focus vs. revenue generation
	- Interest in DRG detection (overbilling prevention)
	- 5% chart review requirement resonates with payers
- Blue Cross Blue Shield NC showed interest in broader applications

### Financial Projections & Runway

- Current revenue finishing ~$750K (mix of recurring and one-off)
- Conservative projection: $1.5M ARR by mid-2026 from Render + Kieran
- Runway extends through October 2026 at $0 operating margin
- Pricing model: $50K platform fee + $0.75/encounter
- Cost structure: 2.5 cents inference + 1-2 cents human QA = 80%+ margins

### Go-to-Market Questions

- Platform proven, clear customer value demonstrated
- Remaining challenge: building robust commercial pipeline
- Sales cycles: 18-24 months for payer contracts
- Two hiring priorities when revenue supports:

### Next Steps

- Judah: Continue product research calls with payers and payviders
- Sean: Will intro to Kieran CFO if timing makes sense (no immediate outreach needed)
- Virtue team: Provide payer contacts for product research discussions
- All: Reconvene in person (JP Morgan conference timing) to assess fundraising readiness

### Portfolio Company Updates

- 32 Murals: Decent position, needs 1-2 major contracts
	- $2.5M convertible note, runway not material concern
- Anna: Exceptional performance, preempted with $17.5M Series A term sheet
	- Closing before year-end
	- Board member with full financial access
- Clara: Worst performing company on list
	- Need significant improvement
- Mural: ~$20M bookings expected by year-end

- Zoom Logic: Good progress, fine contract acquisition
	- High Series A interest for next year raise
- Valley Steer: $1.5-2M top line revenue
	- Sufficient for Series A if chosen

### Right Site Concerns & Valuation Approach

- Major underperformer burning >$800K monthly vs minimal revenue
- Raised ~$25M total, at “put up or shut up” phase
- Recommendation: Write down to cost (not full write-off)
	- Proactive, responsible GP approach
	- Flag as concern for LP conversations
	- Still has 8-10 months runway

- Market seeing high Series A prices (Translucent: $105-100M after 6-7 months)
	- Series B at $500M-1B range
- Most GPs taking frothy marks during current period
- Agreement to intervene if marks become unrealistic vs value

	- No follow-on investment planned
- Hermes: Received $4M SAFE term sheet at $18M post
	- Original investment: $500K at $5M post (lowest price pre-seed)

### HealthMC Product Performance Update

- Current burn: ~$175K/month (maximum forecasted)
- Team reduced through RIFs, focused on AI research and data ops
- Platform improvements delivered significant results:
	- 98% recall, 90s precision on AI performance
	- ROI models showing 8-10x returns on customer data
	- Inference costs dropped 98-99% (V0: $3/chart → V2: 2 cents/chart)
	- Fixed data ops issues causing 10% chart loss (high-value charts)

### Active Customer Contracts

- Render contract signed: $50K installation + 10% of value found
	- Processing 16K patients through year-end
	- Handshake agreement to move off Credo paper if successful
	- Conservative model: $500K value = $100K total payment
- Kieran ongoing discussions with Nate Amak (Chief Population Health Officer)
	- Strong ROI presentation, evaluating integration needs
	- Competing against internal AI builds
- Gather and PCC contracts continuing into next year

### Payer Market Research Strategy

- Conducting product research calls (not direct sales pitches)
- 40 outreach attempts → 20 calls (10 completed, 10 scheduled)
- Key insights emerging:
	- Cost reduction focus vs. revenue generation
	- Interest in DRG detection (overbilling prevention)
	- 5% chart review requirement resonates with payers
- Blue Cross Blue Shield NC showed interest in broader applications

### Financial Projections & Runway

- Current revenue finishing ~$750K (mix of recurring and one-off)
- Conservative projection: $1.5M ARR by mid-2026 from Render + Kieran
- Runway extends through October 2026 at $0 operating margin
- Pricing model: $50K platform fee + $0.75/encounter
- Cost structure: 2.5 cents inference + 1-2 cents human QA = 80%+ margins

### Go-to-Market Questions

- Platform proven, clear customer value demonstrated
- Remaining challenge: building robust commercial pipeline
- Sales cycles: 18-24 months for payer contracts
- Two hiring priorities when revenue supports:

### Next Steps

- Judah: Continue product research calls with payers and payviders
- Sean: Will intro to Kieran CFO if timing makes sense (no immediate outreach needed)
- Virtue team: Provide payer contacts for product research discussions
- All: Reconvene in person (JP Morgan conference timing) to assess fundraising readiness

### Portfolio Company Updates

- 32 Murals: Decent position, needs 1-2 major contracts
	- $2.5M convertible note, runway not material concern
- Anna: Exceptional performance, preempted with $17.5M Series A term sheet
	- Closing before year-end
	- Board member with full financial access
- Clara: Worst performing company on list
	- Need significant improvement
- Mural: ~$20M bookings expected by year-end
	- Ahead of pace, limited visibility on details
- Integral: Strong business growth
	- Started year at $500K, ending between $6-9M ACV

- Zoom Logic: Good progress, fine contract acquisition
	- High Series A interest for next year raise
- Valley Steer: $1.5-2M top line revenue
	- Sufficient for Series A if chosen

### Right Site Concerns & Valuation Approach

- Major underperformer burning >$800K monthly vs minimal revenue
- Raised ~$25M total, at “put up or shut up” phase
- Recommendation: Write down to cost (not full write-off)
	- Proactive, responsible GP approach
	- Flag as concern for LP conversations
	- Still has 8-10 months runway

### Market Valuation Discussion

- Current portfolio appropriately valued, nothing “aggressively frothy”
- Market seeing high Series A prices (Translucent: $105-100M after 6-7 months)
	- Series B at $500M-1B range
- Most GPs taking frothy marks during current period
- Agreement to intervene if marks become unrealistic vs value

### Recent Investment Activity

- Prudential closed: Now $17.5M Series A at $75M post
	- No follow-on investment planned
- Hermes: Received $4M SAFE term sheet at $18M post
	- Original investment: $500K at $5M post (lowest price pre-seed)
	- Accelerated process to close before holidays
	- No additional investment expected

### Next Steps

- Sean: Compile spreadsheet with portfolio company metrics
	- Cash position, runway, revenue/ARR, qualitative updates
	- Leverage upcoming portfolio calls and board meetings
	- May need to request Mural financials directly
- Dave: Review cash position next week for distribution decisions
	- Payroll impact on available cash
	- Frank Rimmerman may request company financial statements for validation

	- Handshake agreement to move off Credo paper if successful
	- Conservative model: $500K value = $100K total payment
- Kieran ongoing discussions with Nate Amak (Chief Population Health Officer)
	- Strong ROI presentation, evaluating integration needs

### Financial Projections & Runway

- Current revenue finishing ~$750K (mix of recurring and one-off)
- Conservative projection: $1.5M ARR by mid-2026 from Render + Kieran
- Runway extends through October 2026 at $0 operating margin
- Pricing model: $50K platform fee + $0.75/encounter
- Cost structure: 2.5 cents inference + 1-2 cents human QA = 80%+ margins

### Go-to-Market Questions

- Platform proven, clear customer value demonstrated
- Remaining challenge: building robust commercial pipeline
- Sales cycles: 18-24 months for payer contracts
- Two hiring priorities when revenue supports:

### Next Steps

- Judah: Continue product research calls with payers and payviders

### Portfolio Company Updates

- 32 Murals: Decent position, needs 1-2 major contracts
	- $2.5M convertible note, runway not material concern
- Anna: Exceptional performance, preempted with $17.5M Series A term sheet
	- Closing before year-end
	- Board member with full financial access
- Clara: Worst performing company on list
	- Need significant improvement

- Market seeing high Series A prices (Translucent: $105-100M after 6-7 months)
	- Series B at $500M-1B range

- Hermes: Received $4M SAFE term sheet at $18M post
	- Original investment: $500K at $5M post (lowest price pre-seed)

### HealthMC Product Performance Update

- Current burn: ~$175K/month (maximum forecasted)
- Team reduced through RIFs, focused on AI research and data ops
- Platform improvements delivered significant results:
	- 98% recall, 90s precision on AI performance
	- ROI models showing 8-10x returns on customer data
	- Inference costs dropped 98-99% (V0: $3/chart → V2: 2 cents/chart)
	- Fixed data ops issues causing 10% chart loss (high-value charts)

### Active Customer Contracts

- Render contract signed: $50K installation + 10% of value found
	- Processing 16K patients through year-end
	- Handshake agreement to move off Credo paper if successful
	- Conservative model: $500K value = $100K total payment
- Kieran ongoing discussions with Nate Amak (Chief Population Health Officer)
	- Strong ROI presentation, evaluating integration needs
	- Competing against internal AI builds
- Gather and PCC contracts continuing into next year

### Payer Market Research Strategy

- Conducting product research calls (not direct sales pitches)
- 40 outreach attempts → 20 calls (10 completed, 10 scheduled)
- Key insights emerging:
	- Cost reduction focus vs. revenue generation
	- Interest in DRG detection (overbilling prevention)
	- 5% chart review requirement resonates with payers
- Blue Cross Blue Shield NC showed interest in broader applications

### Financial Projections & Runway

- Current revenue finishing ~$750K (mix of recurring and one-off)
- Conservative projection: $1.5M ARR by mid-2026 from Render + Kieran
- Runway extends through October 2026 at $0 operating margin
- Pricing model: $50K platform fee + $0.75/encounter
- Cost structure: 2.5 cents inference + 1-2 cents human QA = 80%+ margins

### Go-to-Market Questions

- Platform proven, clear customer value demonstrated
- Remaining challenge: building robust commercial pipeline
- Sales cycles: 18-24 months for payer contracts
- Two hiring priorities when revenue supports:

### Next Steps

- Judah: Continue product research calls with payers and payviders
- Sean: Will intro to Kieran CFO if timing makes sense (no immediate outreach needed)
- Virtue team: Provide payer contacts for product research discussions
- All: Reconvene in person (JP Morgan conference timing) to assess fundraising readiness

### Portfolio Company Updates

- 32 Murals: Decent position, needs 1-2 major contracts
	- $2.5M convertible note, runway not material concern
- Anna: Exceptional performance, preempted with $17.5M Series A term sheet
	- Closing before year-end
	- Board member with full financial access
- Clara: Worst performing company on list
	- Need significant improvement

### HealthMC Product Performance Update

- Current burn: ~$175K/month (maximum forecasted)
- Team reduced through RIFs, focused on AI research and data ops
- Platform improvements delivered significant results:
	- 98% recall, 90s precision on AI performance
	- ROI models showing 8-10x returns on customer data
	- Inference costs dropped 98-99% (V0: $3/chart → V2: 2 cents/chart)
	- Fixed data ops issues causing 10% chart loss (high-value charts)

### Active Customer Contracts

- Render contract signed: $50K installation + 10% of value found
	- Processing 16K patients through year-end
	- Handshake agreement to move off Credo paper if successful
	- Conservative model: $500K value = $100K total payment
- Kieran ongoing discussions with Nate Amak (Chief Population Health Officer)
	- Strong ROI presentation, evaluating integration needs
	- Competing against internal AI builds
- Gather and PCC contracts continuing into next year

### Payer Market Research Strategy

- Conducting product research calls (not direct sales pitches)
- 40 outreach attempts → 20 calls (10 completed, 10 scheduled)
- Key insights emerging:
	- Cost reduction focus vs. revenue generation
	- Interest in DRG detection (overbilling prevention)
	- 5% chart review requirement resonates with payers
- Blue Cross Blue Shield NC showed interest in broader applications

### Financial Projections & Runway

- Current revenue finishing ~$750K (mix of recurring and one-off)
- Conservative projection: $1.5M ARR by mid-2026 from Render + Kieran
- Runway extends through October 2026 at $0 operating margin
- Pricing model: $50K platform fee + $0.75/encounter
- Cost structure: 2.5 cents inference + 1-2 cents human QA = 80%+ margins

### Go-to-Market Questions

- Platform proven, clear customer value demonstrated
- Remaining challenge: building robust commercial pipeline
- Sales cycles: 18-24 months for payer contracts
- Two hiring priorities when revenue supports:

### Next Steps

- Judah: Continue product research calls with payers and payviders
- Sean: Will intro to Kieran CFO if timing makes sense (no immediate outreach needed)
- Virtue team: Provide payer contacts for product research discussions
- All: Reconvene in person (JP Morgan conference timing) to assess fundraising readiness

### Portfolio Company Updates

- 32 Murals: Decent position, needs 1-2 major contracts
	- $2.5M convertible note, runway not material concern
- Anna: Exceptional performance, preempted with $17.5M Series A term sheet
	- Closing before year-end
	- Board member with full financial access
- Clara: Worst performing company on list
	- Need significant improvement
- Mural: ~$20M bookings expected by year-end
	- Ahead of pace, limited visibility on details
- Integral: Strong business growth
	- Started year at $500K, ending between $6-9M ACV
	- Term sheet expected this week/next

	- Series A fundraise planned January/February
- Zoom Logic: Good progress, fine contract acquisition
	- High Series A interest for next year raise
- Valley Steer: $1.5-2M top line revenue
	- Sufficient for Series A if chosen

### Right Site Concerns & Valuation Approach

- Major underperformer burning >$800K monthly vs minimal revenue
- Raised ~$25M total, at “put up or shut up” phase
- Recommendation: Write down to cost (not full write-off)
	- Proactive, responsible GP approach
	- Flag as concern for LP conversations
	- Still has 8-10 months runway

### Market Valuation Discussion

- Current portfolio appropriately valued, nothing “aggressively frothy”
- Market seeing high Series A prices (Translucent: $105-100M after 6-7 months)
	- Series B at $500M-1B range
- Most GPs taking frothy marks during current period
- Agreement to intervene if marks become unrealistic vs value

### Recent Investment Activity

- Prudential closed: Now $17.5M Series A at $75M post
	- No follow-on investment planned
- Hermes: Received $4M SAFE term sheet at $18M post
	- Original investment: $500K at $5M post (lowest price pre-seed)
	- Accelerated process to close before holidays
	- No additional investment expected

### Next Steps

- Sean: Compile spreadsheet with portfolio company metrics
	- Cash position, runway, revenue/ARR, qualitative updates
	- Leverage upcoming portfolio calls and board meetings
	- May need to request Mural financials directly
- Dave: Review cash position next week for distribution decisions
	- Payroll impact on available cash
	- Frank Rimmerman may request company financial statements for validation

	- 98% recall, 90s precision on AI performance
	- ROI models showing 8-10x returns on customer data
	- Inference costs dropped 98-99% (V0: $3/chart → V2: 2 cents/chart)
	- Fixed data ops issues causing 10% chart loss (high-value charts)

### Active Customer Contracts

- Render contract signed: $50K installation + 10% of value found
	- Processing 16K patients through year-end
	- Handshake agreement to move off Credo paper if successful
	- Conservative model: $500K value = $100K total payment
- Kieran ongoing discussions with Nate Amak (Chief Population Health Officer)
	- Strong ROI presentation, evaluating integration needs
	- Competing against internal AI builds
- Gather and PCC contracts continuing into next year

### Payer Market Research Strategy

- Conducting product research calls (not direct sales pitches)
- 40 outreach attempts → 20 calls (10 completed, 10 scheduled)
- Key insights emerging:
	- Cost reduction focus vs. revenue generation
	- Interest in DRG detection (overbilling prevention)
	- 5% chart review requirement resonates with payers
- Blue Cross Blue Shield NC showed interest in broader applications

### Financial Projections & Runway

- Current revenue finishing ~$750K (mix of recurring and one-off)
- Conservative projection: $1.5M ARR by mid-2026 from Render + Kieran
- Runway extends through October 2026 at $0 operating margin
- Pricing model: $50K platform fee + $0.75/encounter
- Cost structure: 2.5 cents inference + 1-2 cents human QA = 80%+ margins

### Go-to-Market Questions

- Platform proven, clear customer value demonstrated
- Remaining challenge: building robust commercial pipeline
- Sales cycles: 18-24 months for payer contracts
- Two hiring priorities when revenue supports:

### Next Steps

- Judah: Continue product research calls with payers and payviders
- Sean: Will intro to Kieran CFO if timing makes sense (no immediate outreach needed)
- Virtue team: Provide payer contacts for product research discussions
- All: Reconvene in person (JP Morgan conference timing) to assess fundraising readiness

### Portfolio Company Updates

- 32 Murals: Decent position, needs 1-2 major contracts
	- $2.5M convertible note, runway not material concern
- Anna: Exceptional performance, preempted with $17.5M Series A term sheet
	- Closing before year-end
	- Board member with full financial access
- Clara: Worst performing company on list
	- Need significant improvement
- Mural: ~$20M bookings expected by year-end

- Zoom Logic: Good progress, fine contract acquisition
	- High Series A interest for next year raise

- Market seeing high Series A prices (Translucent: $105-100M after 6-7 months)
	- Series B at $500M-1B range
- Most GPs taking frothy marks during current period
- Agreement to intervene if marks become unrealistic vs value

- Hermes: Received $4M SAFE term sheet at $18M post
	- Original investment: $500K at $5M post (lowest price pre-seed)

### Next Steps

- Sean: Compile spreadsheet with portfolio company metrics
	- Cash position, runway, revenue/ARR, qualitative updates

### HealthMC Product Performance Update

- Current burn: ~$175K/month (maximum forecasted)
- Team reduced through RIFs, focused on AI research and data ops
- Platform improvements delivered significant results:
	- 98% recall, 90s precision on AI performance
	- ROI models showing 8-10x returns on customer data
	- Inference costs dropped 98-99% (V0: $3/chart → V2: 2 cents/chart)
	- Fixed data ops issues causing 10% chart loss (high-value charts)

### Active Customer Contracts

- Render contract signed: $50K installation + 10% of value found
	- Processing 16K patients through year-end
	- Handshake agreement to move off Credo paper if successful
	- Conservative model: $500K value = $100K total payment
- Kieran ongoing discussions with Nate Amak (Chief Population Health Officer)
	- Strong ROI presentation, evaluating integration needs
	- Competing against internal AI builds
- Gather and PCC contracts continuing into next year

### Payer Market Research Strategy

- Conducting product research calls (not direct sales pitches)
- 40 outreach attempts → 20 calls (10 completed, 10 scheduled)
- Key insights emerging:
	- Cost reduction focus vs. revenue generation
	- Interest in DRG detection (overbilling prevention)
	- 5% chart review requirement resonates with payers
- Blue Cross Blue Shield NC showed interest in broader applications

### Financial Projections & Runway

- Current revenue finishing ~$750K (mix of recurring and one-off)
- Conservative projection: $1.5M ARR by mid-2026 from Render + Kieran
- Runway extends through October 2026 at $0 operating margin
- Pricing model: $50K platform fee + $0.75/encounter
- Cost structure: 2.5 cents inference + 1-2 cents human QA = 80%+ margins

### Go-to-Market Questions

- Platform proven, clear customer value demonstrated
- Remaining challenge: building robust commercial pipeline
- Sales cycles: 18-24 months for payer contracts
- Two hiring priorities when revenue supports:

### Next Steps

- Judah: Continue product research calls with payers and payviders
- Sean: Will intro to Kieran CFO if timing makes sense (no immediate outreach needed)
- Virtue team: Provide payer contacts for product research discussions
- All: Reconvene in person (JP Morgan conference timing) to assess fundraising readiness

### HealthMC Product Performance Update

- Current burn: ~$175K/month (maximum forecasted)
- Team reduced through RIFs, focused on AI research and data ops
- Platform improvements delivered significant results:
	- 98% recall, 90s precision on AI performance
	- ROI models showing 8-10x returns on customer data
	- Inference costs dropped 98-99% (V0: $3/chart → V2: 2 cents/chart)
	- Fixed data ops issues causing 10% chart loss (high-value charts)

### Active Customer Contracts

- Render contract signed: $50K installation + 10% of value found
	- Processing 16K patients through year-end
	- Handshake agreement to move off Credo paper if successful
	- Conservative model: $500K value = $100K total payment
- Kieran ongoing discussions with Nate Amak (Chief Population Health Officer)
	- Strong ROI presentation, evaluating integration needs
	- Competing against internal AI builds
- Gather and PCC contracts continuing into next year

### Payer Market Research Strategy

- Conducting product research calls (not direct sales pitches)
- 40 outreach attempts → 20 calls (10 completed, 10 scheduled)
- Key insights emerging:
	- Cost reduction focus vs. revenue generation
	- Interest in DRG detection (overbilling prevention)
	- 5% chart review requirement resonates with payers
- Blue Cross Blue Shield NC showed interest in broader applications

### Financial Projections & Runway

- Current revenue finishing ~$750K (mix of recurring and one-off)
- Conservative projection: $1.5M ARR by mid-2026 from Render + Kieran
- Runway extends through October 2026 at $0 operating margin
- Pricing model: $50K platform fee + $0.75/encounter
- Cost structure: 2.5 cents inference + 1-2 cents human QA = 80%+ margins

### Go-to-Market Questions

- Platform proven, clear customer value demonstrated
- Remaining challenge: building robust commercial pipeline
- Sales cycles: 18-24 months for payer contracts
- Two hiring priorities when revenue supports:

### Next Steps

- Judah: Continue product research calls with payers and payviders
- Sean: Will intro to Kieran CFO if timing makes sense (no immediate outreach needed)
- Virtue team: Provide payer contacts for product research discussions
- All: Reconvene in person (JP Morgan conference timing) to assess fundraising readiness

### Portfolio Company Updates

- 32 Murals: Decent position, needs 1-2 major contracts
	- $2.5M convertible note, runway not material concern
- Anna: Exceptional performance, preempted with $17.5M Series A term sheet
	- Closing before year-end
	- Board member with full financial access
- Clara: Worst performing company on list
	- Need significant improvement
- Mural: ~$20M bookings expected by year-end
	- Ahead of pace, limited visibility on details
- Integral: Strong business growth
	- Started year at $500K, ending between $6-9M ACV
	- Term sheet expected this week/next
- Solstice: Strong momentum with contracts signed in last 90 days
	- Series A fundraise planned January/February
- Zoom Logic: Good progress, fine contract acquisition
	- High Series A interest for next year raise
- Valley Steer: $1.5-2M top line revenue
	- Sufficient for Series A if chosen

### Right Site Concerns & Valuation Approach

- Major underperformer burning >$800K monthly vs minimal revenue
- Raised ~$25M total, at “put up or shut up” phase
- Recommendation: Write down to cost (not full write-off)
	- Proactive, responsible GP approach
	- Flag as concern for LP conversations
	- Still has 8-10 months runway

### Market Valuation Discussion

- Current portfolio appropriately valued, nothing “aggressively frothy”
- Market seeing high Series A prices (Translucent: $105-100M after 6-7 months)
	- Series B at $500M-1B range
- Most GPs taking frothy marks during current period
- Agreement to intervene if marks become unrealistic vs value

### Recent Investment Activity

- Prudential closed: Now $17.5M Series A at $75M post
	- No follow-on investment planned
- Hermes: Received $4M SAFE term sheet at $18M post
	- Original investment: $500K at $5M post (lowest price pre-seed)
	- Accelerated process to close before holidays
	- No additional investment expected

### Next Steps

- Sean: Compile spreadsheet with portfolio company metrics
	- Cash position, runway, revenue/ARR, qualitative updates
	- Leverage upcoming portfolio calls and board meetings
	- May need to request Mural financials directly
- Dave: Review cash position next week for distribution decisions
	- Payroll impact on available cash
	- Frank Rimmerman may request company financial statements for validation
