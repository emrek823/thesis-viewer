# The Afterlife of Epic's Workshop

### Slight stagnation and a purge of Toolbox mark a strange chapter for the developer ecosystem to close the year

From “[The Quiet Burial of Epic’s Workshop](https://healthapiguy.substack.com/p/the-quiet-burial-of-epics-workshop)” in October:

> ***[Epic](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#)**‘s Workshop category has been the intense focus of much dialogue and debate, yet its death came with a whimper and not a bang.*
>
> *Okay, perhaps a bit hyperbolic, but I do think it’s fascinating that there’s been little to no commentary on the condensing of the Toolbox/Workshop categories in Epic’s Showroom, given how 𝘢𝘯𝘺 moves there typically have caused widespread hyperventilation.*

Not long thereafter, Politico reported that, indeed, [Epic was planning on ending the program](https://www.axios.com/pro/health-tech-deals/2025/10/23/epic-ending-workshop-health-startups-abridge). From that article:

> *An Epic spokesperson confirmed to Axios Pro that the company plans to end the Workshop program and said it would first close the part of the program specific to ambient voice recognition technology.*

However, 2025 has gone, 2026 has arrived, and yet somehow Workshop still persists in some form despite announcements to the contrary. What gives?

Genesys and Talkdesk are still listed under Contact Center Productivity Tools, alongside one competing Toolbox entry:

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!crCF!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe71c0771-8701-4726-93cc-0cfaa028dfe4_1354x592.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!crCF!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe71c0771-8701-4726-93cc-0cfaa028dfe4_1354x592.png)

Similarly, [Qualtrics](https://showroom.epic.com/Listing?id=1213&returnTitle=6) and [Press Ganey](https://showroom.epic.com/Listing?id=2765&returnTitle=6) are the two entries under Patient Feedback (although [they are now one market dominant mega-corporation](https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/value-based-termites-the-hospital?r=7enba)):

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!czdh!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc22a2a57-6778-47a3-896d-41551b0849ca_920x422.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!czdh!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc22a2a57-6778-47a3-896d-41551b0849ca_920x422.png)

It remains strategically unclear to me why they allow Workshop to persist! It’s a blemish on their already less-than-stellar record of handling external communications. Moreover, it’s a continued risk as antitrust and information blocking lawsuits continue to pile up.

More tactically, they are already clearly moving prior Workshop work into the “Under Construction” moniker. Look no further than Press Ganey’s page:

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4KJl!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5e454964-aa01-4aa9-a102-3c2a4ac1976c_1512x1134.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4KJl!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5e454964-aa01-4aa9-a102-3c2a4ac1976c_1512x1134.png)

Overall, the total number of Workshop apps dropped from 5 down to 4 (seemingly as one of the vendor consolidated their Workshop apps). Perhaps Epic is locked into Workshop by contract and plan to sunset the categories as those term out. Regardless, I’m confused by contradiction of the admission in October and the laggard behavior here. It’s distinctly not a good look to only sunset the ambient scribe category after [announcing your own](https://healthapiguy.substack.com/p/epics-ambient-bombshell?utm_source=publication-search)!

One other dynamic of the Showroom marketplace that has me befuddled is what’s going on with Toolbox. By all accounts, it’s been a success, offering a path with guardrails and real support to third parties. Developers have shown a continued appetite for those offerings - it’s grown from 44 entries in July to 78 to close the year.

I started tracking the growth of Toolbox in summer 2024 with [periodic posts](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/brendan-keeler_took-a-peek-at-the-epic-toolbox-categories-activity-7314667490343624704-mfbA/). Epic made substantial investments since then, with the 21 categories ballooning to 48 as of this past July, as seen in the tracker [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QGi_MT96_IGoji9ESZU95FPNsMiZbSkh_H7Bv9e4GUU/edit?usp=sharing). But the category growth stalled in Q3 and Q4, adding only one by September and none in the final three years.

I do wonder if it ties to the [Texas’ antitrust case against them](https://healthapiguy.substack.com/p/dont-mess-with-texas-epic-edition) and, more specifically, the [Civil Investigative Demand](https://healthapiguy.substack.com/p/epics-two-front-war). From a timing perspective, a CID would undoubtedly have been in progress by July (or possibly even the start of the year). Perhaps the looming crystallization of Texas’ foreclosure theory caused Epic’s lawyers to freeze things a bit?

All that analysis pales in comparison, though, to the purge we’ve seen in Toolbox since the turn of the year, as the total number of apps dropped from 78 down to 58. Numerous applications were dropped from Toolbox to Connection Hub, such as:

* AvaSure Intelligent Virtual Care Platform
* Becklar Workforce Safety - WorkerSafety Pro
* hellocare.ai
* Imprivata Identity Verification for MyChart
* Insight Health AI Scribe
* Teladoc Solo Inpatient
* Vouched Identity
* VSTOne: AI Care Platform

Some of these appear to correspond with categories that were Under Construction, like MyChart Identity Verification or Staff Duress. Perhaps those vendors failed to participate fully in the Toolbox category's development. But other entries like hellocare.ai or Insight Health were using mature Blueprints. My only guess is that they failed to attain actual clients within a specified time period.

It’s tough to find the unifying thread here. Nothing about the last six months of Showroom behavior feels like ordinary product management. But it does feel like a marketplace being slowly reshaped by a legal ghost hand that never appears in release notes. Maybe the pattern suggests not indecision, but de-risking: an EHR ecosystem learning, in real time, which parts of itself it can no longer afford to grow.
