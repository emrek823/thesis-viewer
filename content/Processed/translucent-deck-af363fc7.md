## Slide 10: Value / ROI / Usage at a Glance

# Value / ROI / Usage at a Glance

**STRONG EARLY USAGE**
70%+ of engaged users run 5-20 queries per session

**PRODUCTIVITY GAINS**
For example in one week, we handled 64 FP&A requests / workflows equating to 200 hrs in time savings

**ERROR REDUCTION**
*   Lack of real-time data updates - Found 20% data discrepancy with scheduling data in Excel models
*   Version control issues - Found APP mapping information not updated for months, driving incorrect benchmarking

**EXPANSION PULL**
Users are engaging with our product to understand productivity, benchmarking, rev performance. But they want more and are aggressively pulling us to add data / use cases
