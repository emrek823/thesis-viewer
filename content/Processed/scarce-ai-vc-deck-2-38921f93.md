# Scarce AI

## Slide 1: Scarce AI
[Image: Logo of a four-leaf clover, colored with a gradient from green to light blue, next to the text "Scarce AI"]

## Slide 2: Problem
Problem
Data scarcity slows down AI innovation in healthcare.
Medical datasets have privacy and regulatory concerns including HIPAA restrictions and privacy liability. These unique features make data scarcity a key bottleneck for AI developers in healthcare compared to other industries.

[Image: A circular diagram divided into three sections, representing barriers to "Innovation" (center).
- Top section: Privacy (light green)
- Left section: Scarcity (green)
- Right section: Bias (dark green)]

## Slide 3: Impact
Impact
AI can have a massive impact in health care, like any industry. But only if data scarcity is addressed.

### Health Impact
*   **14M** Lives can be saved yearly from AI
*   **250K** Deaths are responsible because of human error

### Economic Impact
*   **$360B** Dollars can be saved yearly because of AI
*   **10%** Of total spending can be saved because of AI

## Slide 4: Summary
Summary
Scarce AI provides accurate and anonymous synthetic data to train AI models.
We meet customer needs by providing data access in the scarce data market. We meet privacy concerns by using synthetic data to preserve real patient data trends and patterns while keeping patient identities anonymous.

[Image: Four numbered boxes with features:]
1.  **Abundant**
2.  **Diverse**
3.  **Secure**
4.  **Accurate**

## Slide 5: Process
Process
Our platform currently offers two types of data
We conducted customer discovery interviews and identified two major gaps. There is a great unmet need for longitudinal clinical notes and medical 3D (MRI, CT, X-rays etc...).
We provide these datatypes in a customer facing platform, where users can generate and customize the data to their liking (biological sex, ethnicity, disease, etc).

[Image: Two columns of features for different data types.]

### Type 1: Longitudinal Clinical Notes
1.  Synthetic patients from different backgrounds
2.  Longitudinal consistency
3.  Wide variety of conditions

### Type 2: 3D Imagery
1.  Consistency between 2D slices
2.  Wide variety of scans (MRI, CT, ultrasound, etc.)
3.  Rare conditions and diseases

## Slide 6: Market
Market
The synthetic data market for healthcare associated AI is coupled to the exponential growth of the AI market in healthcare.

[Image: Six circular data points, some overlapping, illustrating market growth.]

*   **$0.3B** Synthetic data market in 2023
*   **$2.1B** Synthetic data Market in 2030
*   **$3.47B** Clinical notes and 3D imagery in Healthcare Market in 2023
*   **$34.01B** Clinical notes and 3D imagery in Healthcare Market in 2030
*   **60%** Of data will be synthetic by 2024
*   **36%** compound annual growth rate of data consumption in healthcare by 2025

## Slide 7: Target
Target
Our customers:

[Image: Four icons representing customer segments.]
*   [Robot icon] Health AI Companies
*   [Documents with magnifying glass icon] Research Groups
*   [Shop icon] Data Shops
*   [Graduation cap icon] Healthcare Education

## Slide 8: Traction
Traction
Key milestones addressed thus far:

[Image: Five numbered milestones arranged horizontally with arrows indicating progression.]

1.  **Built out working MVP**
2.  **Partnered with Gradient Health** to get access to all their data and sell data through their platform
3.  **Established 17 design partners** to iterate our data. Now converting them to paid. Have 5 LOI's
4.  **Partnered with 3 data distribution companies** to sell our data as well as more training data
5.  **Partnered with private practice and data shops** to get more data and create a moat

## Slide 9: 10 year plan
10 year plan
Vision for next steps:

[Image: A roadmap showing four phases with associated milestones and customer growth.]

### Phase 1 (25 customers)
*   MVP
*   Relocate team together
*   Longitudinal Clinical Notes
*   3D Imagery
*   Customer Platform

### Phase 2 (75 customers)
*   Increase data flexibility
*   Pharma Data
*   Claims data
*   Hire another engineer

### Phase 3 (100 customers)
*   Improve the product
*   Customization
*   Partner with hospitals

### Phase 4
*   Expand data
*   Create a synthetic patient

## Slide 10: Business Model
Business Model
We have three ways of generating revenue:

[Image: Three columns, each detailing revenue generation for a different product/service.]

### Text
*   We charge per page created for synthetic notes it can range from $.50 to $5 a page
*   The price can change based on complexity of the note
*   Will create a subscription plan eventually

### Image
*   Images can sell for a pretty varied spectrum of prices from $2.50 to $25 an image
*   Rarer more complicated images are a higher price
*   Will create a subscription plan eventually

### Data Shop
*   We take 50% of all sales done
*   Data shops handle all the marketing
*   We also then can train our model on their data
