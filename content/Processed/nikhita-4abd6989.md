# Vice President of Emerging Products at Lyric

## Cloud Migration:
Typically phased (for example, starting with one Medicaid line of business) and yields lower infrastructure costs, elasticity for claim surges, and easier security management once full stack components move together.

## ROI and Cost of Implementation:
Migration costs are roughly equivalent to one to one-and-a-half years of license fees, requiring about a 25% cost reduction over a five-year contract to break even. Because few payers track per-claim unit costs, ROI is directional at best—it depends on operational simplification, reduced maintenance, and staff efficiency, not just software licensing.

## Integration Complexity:
Partial migrations don't work: eligibility, credentialing, network, and editing systems must move with claims to capture real cloud benefits. HealthEdge wins here because its products are natively interoperable and designed for seamless cloud connectivity, while hybrid setups retain legacy latency and maintenance burdens.

## Payment Integrity and Editing Systems:
HealthEdge (Burgess) excels in pricing accuracy—especially for Medicare—but lags in clinical content depth versus Optum or Lyric, whose broader edit libraries generate 20–30x ROI compared to roughly 10x for secondary systems. Success in this segment depends on clinical coding content, AMA/NCCI licensing, and continuous rule regression testing—not the core technology itself.

## Care Management and Provider Data:
Care management modules (GuidingCare, Wellframe) are well integrated but harder to quantify ROI since costs fall on IT while savings accrue to clinical teams, creating incentive misalignment. Provider data management adds value mainly when update latency or data quality gaps affect adjudication; otherwise, differentiation and cost savings are minimal.

## HealthEdge vs. TriZetto Functionality:
HealthEdge is faster and more automated, allowing provider setup and contract creation in minutes, while TriZetto requires full re-accreditation when a provider's tax ID or affiliation changes. HealthEdge's cloud architecture and API-based credentialing make it more dynamic for network management and claims flow. HealthEdge differentiates through built-in analytics that detect missing diagnosis and procedure codes (e.g., linking amputations to diabetes management) and preemptively surface follow-up needs. These capabilities reduce redetermination cycles and readmissions, allowing care teams to act on insights automatically during adjudication. HealthEdge uniquely integrates contracts, CMS fee schedules, and accounts payable, automating the full payment lifecycle and cutting cycle times from weeks to minutes. TriZetto performs similar checks but still relies on manual contract parameter entry and human intervention for approvals and payments.

## Mid-Market Scale and Adoption Dynamics:
Roughly 60-65% of payer lives are now vended to HealthEdge or TriZetto, while homegrown systems account for less than 5 %. Smaller payers remain fertile ground, but large payers have standardized on external CAPS vendors to avoid the internal IT burden and compliance risk of maintaining in-house systems.

## Consolidation and Vendor Rationalization:
Enterprises are consolidating from 3-5 specialized vendors to single-vendor suites like HealthEdge or TriZetto to simplify procurement, reduce vendor management, and gain unified analytics. This “one-stop-shop” dynamic makes cross-selling modules (provider management, care, payment integrity) highly effective and resource-efficient for payers.

# Machinify - EVP of Operations at Cotiviti Holdings, Inc

## Cotiviti vs. New Entrants (Rialtic, Codoxo, Machinify)

*   Rialtic is positioning as a self-service SaaS platform that enables payers to configure and run their own pre-pay edits rather than outsourcing to vendors. It sells flexibility ("do it yourself") rather than depth of content. It's focused on the primary editing layer (code-level validation, not complex claim analytics) and provides a small starter pack of rules that clients can customize.
*   Machinify is a services-based AI vendor, ingesting payer data to algorithmically infer denial patterns and reverse-engineer content from prior results. Unlike Rialtic, it is fully service-driven, not self-service, and sells to large payers experimenting with in-sourcing payment integrity using AI models rather than fixed content libraries.
*   Codoxo remains earlier-stage, focused on fraud detection and retrospective analytics, not true claim editing; its AI marketing is seen as overstated by incumbents.

## Why Rialtic's GTM Is Unique

Rialtic's go-to-market differentiates on disintermediation and empowerment: instead of selling "savings as a service,” it sells tools to the payer's internal teams, effectively letting large insurers replicate what Cotiviti does but in-house. This approach appeals to plans wary of long implementation cycles, data-sharing with United-owned Optum, and contingency-fee models that take a percent of savings. Rialtic's software-first, modular SaaS model also aligns with Medicaid and regional plan buyers looking for speed and lower total cost of ownership rather than multi-year content contracts.

# Cotiviti Holdings, Inc. - Vice President Of Analytics at Codoxo

## Codoxo
Codoxo began in fraud, waste, and abuse detection, with algorithms originally designed for CMS data and later extended across PI use cases. It positions itself as an AI-native analytics company that combines predictive modeling, ML, and GenAI for case detection and document interrogation rather than a pure service shop. Unlike Cotiviti or Optum, Codoxo sells software-driven insights—tools that help payers detect anomalies and streamline audits rather than outsourcing recovery operations.

## One-Stop Shop:
Experts across the ecosystem view the holy grail as an AI-powered end-to-end payment integrity platform covering risk assignment, provider credentialing, coding validation, benefit application, and accurate payment in one continuum. Achieving this requires sequencing disciplines correctly (e.g., COB before FWA before clinical review) and maintaining a dynamic hierarchy of interventions.

# Cotiviti Holdings, Inc. - Regional Vice President, Payer Market at Optum

## Optum vs. Cotiviti Differentiation

*   **Optum:** Offers the broadest integrated stack across risk adjustment, subrogation, analytics, and claim editing, heavily embedded with large payers (especially UHC and top Blues). Its differentiator is scale and integration—Optum combines prepay and postpay analytics with software tools to help payers become more self-sufficient.
*   **Cotiviti:** Known for its deep content libraries and second-pass analytics, positioning as a postpay and secondary-editor specialist. Optum leads in breadth and prepay enablement; Cotiviti leads in depth of rule coverage and recovery precision.

Top payers (Aetna, Elevance, etc.) are increasingly insourcing COB, data mining, and some claim-editing functions to control margins. Meanwhile, smaller TPAs and regional payers lack volume and ROI to justify large-scale PI implementations, effectively shrinking the commercial TAM for vendors. Growth therefore depends on automating implementation and reducing labor intensity.

# Anterior - Senior Director, Digital Product at UnitedHealthcare.

## Pilot Scope and Metrics at UHC.
UnitedHealthcare (UHC) began its pilot in late 2024 through the company's accelerator program. The pilot focuses on Rx prior auths and core medical imaging/radiology for Medicare Advantage members. Key success KPIs include:

*   ≥ 50 % automation of manual tasks, reducing average review time by 60 %.
*   Accuracy error rate < 20 % (measured post-review).
*   Improved member and provider NPS, mainly from fewer call-center inquiries and faster determinations. If successful, UHC expects to expand to dual-eligible and commercial plans in 2026.

Unlike EviCore (a BPO-heavy clinical review outsourcer) or Cohere (a narrow, provider-facing PA automation platform), Anterior delivers a software-only, payer-focused LLM engine that can be embedded across portals, chatbots, and mobile apps.

*   EviCore = labor scale (nurses, clinicians).
*   Cohere = automation built for providers.
*   Anterior = automation built for payers, interoperable via FHIR and APIs, enabling direct digital integration rather than outsourced reviews.
