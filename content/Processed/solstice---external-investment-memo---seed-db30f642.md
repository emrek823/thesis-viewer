### Executive Summary
The rise of national Health Information Exchanges (HIEs; 92% coverage today) has improved interoperability between health systems who have the money and engineering resources to connect. Community providers, however, don't have the resources to connect and/or structure this data on the back-end. Patient authorized data exchange leveraging FHIR may seem promising, but the surface-level data elements mandated by ONC and CMS today (USCDI data elements) are insufficient for complex clinical care. Community providers must retrieve medical records for every patient that comes for a new or follow-up visit, but the process is entirely manual today ($80 and 2 hours per patient).

Solstice offers community providers an easy-to-use web interface and automates back-end processing for medical record retrieval to gather 2x the records in 3-5 minutes for 80% cheaper from every source (HIE, fax, EMR).

Medical record retrieval for community providers is a $20B market, but has been ignored to-date. Incumbents (Ciox, MRO, etc) focus on large health systems due to manual processes and high cost-structures that make targeting community providers

## Page 3
infeasible. API companies (Particle, Health Gorilla) don't do the work to embed themselves within community providers workflow. Over the last 12 months, co-founders Aris Saxena and Yiwen Li have rapidly iterated on product and built a comprehensive solution to replace community providers current manual processes for medical record retrieval, filtering, and structuring from HIEs, fax, and EMRs. Helping providers access and structure data from HIEs provides an initial wedge into these practices, while adding last-mile data from fax and EMR data provides long-term, durable moats.

Furthermore, recent advances in healthcare data infrastructure and LLMs have finally made it feasible to target smaller practices for medical record retrieval with favorable unit economics (70-90% gross margins). Solstice has already closed its first customer (Oregon Oncology; sales cycle <4 weeks) and has a pipeline of 8 additional oncology providers who have already piloted the product, representing $2.3M in potential ARR.

Solstice provides a solution to replace manual processes that are a “must-have” for clinical operations, expediting initial GTM, and has already identified opportunities to cross-sell within physician networks and with channel partners (EMR/practice management systems). Solving medical record retrieval for oncology practices is the first step in building the largest community provider network for data exchange in the country.

We are excited to lead a $2.5M seed financing at a $12M post-money cap to (1) help Solstice reach $1M+ in ARR with strong unit economics (50-70%), (2) begin to build nodes for its community provider data exchange network across more specialties and regions, and (3) build the foundation for a longitudinal clinical dataset.

### Team: Rapid Iteration to Identify a Non-Obvious Problem
We see many similarities between Aris and Yiwen and the other top first-time founders in the Virtue portfolio (5 of which have recently raised subsequent highly competitive Seed/Series As).

Aris and Yiwen have known each other since freshman year of college, and previously built software for clinics in Africa to manage medication deliveries (3000+ deliveries/day) and an at-home physical therapy marketplace (30+ providers). Over the last 12 months with Solstice, they have been iterating on the exact approach (e.g., evolving from patient-facing application to a provider-facing solution), building product, and selling to customers. This experience developed earned, non-obvious insights that led to the

## Page 4
differentiated approach to target community providers. Aris and Yiwen have been working directly with community providers to solve their problems and saw firsthand how helping community providers access HIE data is a wedge into a broader opportunity to create a network for data exchange among community providers. It is difficult to overstate the value of this organic approach to uncovering this large market opportunity - other founders see HIE coverage rates increasing and believe it's a “solved problem” for community providers.

We have been impressed with the speed of iteration, responsiveness to customer feedback, and point of view on what a future community provider network should and could look like. Their fresh perspective on interoperability landscape drove their initial confidence to target community providers, an area other players have ignored. At the same time, they are aware enough to realize they have a moment in time over the next 2-3 years to scale and capture this opportunity for medical record retrieval. The team is currently supported by a strong network of angel investors - Travis May (Datavant), Cory Levy (Z Fellows), Ed Lando (Misfits Market), Jordan Epstein & Snaebjorn Gunnsteinsson (Juno Kids).

### Market Evolution: Interoperability for Medical Records

## Page 5
The interoperability landscape has evolved over the last decade as access to data has increased for enterprise interoperability between health systems (HIEs providing unstructured but detailed C-CDAs) and patient authorized data exchange (FHIR provides structured but limited USCDI data elements). Going forward, healthcare providers, especially those in the community, are looking to combine this depth and breadth to drive actionable insights from data that is still largely unstructured and siloed.

### Virtue Interoperability Evolution

| | 2012 - 2016 Provider to provider (depth) | 2017 - 2021 APIs + Patient access (breadth) | 2022+ Depth + Breadth = Usability |
| :---------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Description** | Health information exchanges (HIEs) founded to support exchange of C-CDAs, deep clinical data from EMRs that is difficult to parse | APIs provide easier on-ramps to HIEs but are still in JSON format; Increase in patient authorized data exchange leveraging FHIR | Usability wins. Companies must focus on moving beyond commoditized data access to transform/normalize data and access last-mile data to fill in key gaps |
| **Example Players** | commonwell HEALTH ALLIANCE<br>REDOX | particle<br>1up.health | TUVA<br>Solstice |
| **Example Players Breakdown** | **CommonWell Health Alliance**: Pulling queries from EMR networks with XML requests <br> **Redox**: Managed services + signing BAAs with each health system | **Particle**: APIs and record locator service to provide easier access to HIEs <br> **1up.health**: Automating patient access requests to get USCDI data using FHIR standard | **Tuva**: Data transformation for medical records and claims <br> **Solstice**: Retrieval, filtering, and structuring for all EMR, fax, and HIE data |
| **Takeaway** | Data sharing increasing in certain pockets (national/regional networks or within advanced health systems) but lacking standards and continuity to scale | Data breadth increasing but data usability lacking - data from HIEs difficult to use and patient authorized data exchange results in surface level data | True value accrues to those who de-silo, normalize, and provide actionable insights at point-of-care |

**2012 - 2016: Provider to Provider:** Much of the initial work for interoperability focused on large health systems. Non-profit HIEs like CommonWell (founded in 2014) and Carequality (2015) provide networks to access clinical records but community providers are not connected to these networks. Actual queries to the major national networks are formed in different ways, but all patient records are exchanged in the C-CDA format, an inflexible XML export of a patient's full healthcare information. Other companies, such as Redox (founded in 2014), were started to fill in the gaps of HIEs. Redox signs BAAs with individual health systems to standardize data across different health systems (similar to HIEs), but provides modern APIs, read/write capabilities, and managed services to support more efficient interoperability.

### The Three Big Networks and Frameworks
This section presents an image of the US map with locations indicating sites for three major networks. The accompanying text provides statistics.

**CommonWell Health Alliance**
*   → 29,000 sites
*   → 153 million individuals

**carequality**
*   → 55,000 sites
*   → 300,000,000 document exchanges per month

**eHealth Exchange**
*   → 75,000 sites
*   → 120 million individuals

**Particle White Paper:** https://www.particlehealth.com/blog/networks-white-paper-press-release

**2017 - 2021: APIs + Patient Access:** To make data from HIEs easier to access, companies like Particle and Health Gorilla consolidate access to each network with a single API implementation and help convert C-CDA data to flattened JSON output grouped by human-concept datasets (see example below). Community providers cannot decipher this and require a solution like Solstice.

```
While CMS/ONC regulations around patient authorized data exchange are a step in the right direction, limitations around FHIR have hampered progress. FHIR is a query-based

## Page 8
open standard for communicating data with modern API principles, but massive variability exists among providers with actual implementation. Even those institutions that do implement FHIR are only required to implement the bare minimum USCDI dataset to comply with ONC and CMS. This is essentially the equivalent of data a primary care doctor collects during an annual check-up, and lacks data that is required for key provider use-cases in areas like oncology.

**2022+: Depth + Breadth → Usability:** Community providers want interoperability solutions that have (1) **deep data** on each patient, (2) **broad provider coverage** to access complete medical record data from all previous providers, and (3) **actionable insights** to make sense of the data at the point of care. The current interoperability landscape has advanced significantly over the last decade, but fails to solve last-mile problems that fully address these 3 areas for community providers.

1.  **Deep Data:** Regulations from ONC/CMS for patient authorized data exchange only require surface level data elements for compliance, so patients are missing key pieces of information (progress notes, imaging, pathology, genetic reports, etc) when they give a provider access to their record.
2.  **Broad Provider Coverage:** Health Information Exchanges (HIEs) provide more in-depth data compared to patient authorized data exchange, but are focused on large health systems. Community providers don't connect to these national exchanges today, and need to manually collect medical records from other community providers not in the HIEs for a complete picture of an individual patient.
3.  **Actionable Insights:** Data from HIEs is returned as C-CDAs in XML format, or at best JSON files from a Particle/Health Gorilla API that providers still don't know how to interpret. These formats require additional filtering / structuring to be clinically useful.

Health systems have different needs and different solutions. They receive 60-70% of their referrals internally, can utilize vendor-specific interoperability programs from Epic and Cerner, and often don't follow a patient longitudinally like community practices do. Going forward, companies who de-silo information, fill in gaps left by current players, and provide actionable insights to providers as access to certain data types (e.g., HIEs w/ 92% coverage) becomes commoditized will win.

### Solstice Solution: Directly Targeting Gaps for Community Practices
Solstice's solution provides a front-end web tool for admins and back-end data infrastructure that delivers value across these 3 main areas community providers need - **broad coverage** (goes beyond HIEs), **deep data** (provides labs, imaging, progress notes), and **actionable insights** (filtering/structuring data). Today, differentiation is driven by insights around the clinical workflow to filter/structure data for community providers (anyone can technically utilize a Health Gorilla and eFax API). Over time, differentiation will be driven by the network of community providers and data the company can collect outside of HIEs from EMRs and fax.

The product is further described in Solstice's deck, the Virtue Q&A, product roadmap, and loom video, but we highlight key components that inform our thinking below.

#### Simplified Solstice Back-end (Diagram description)
The diagram illustrates the Solstice back-end workflow:
1.  **Admin inputs patient request:** Initiates the process.
2.  **HG API CALL:** Triggers a call to Health Gorilla for patient information.
3.  **Patient Information (Stored in Health Gorilla):** Data is retrieved from Health Gorilla.
4.  **Pull specific resources, filter:** Specific resources are pulled and filtered.
5.  **Filtered Data:** The result of the filtering step.
6.  **Indicate Providers (optional):** Admins can optionally indicate other providers.
7.  **Fax from non-HIE provider:** Faxes are sent to and received from non-HIE providers.
8.  **Postgres DB:** Data is stored in a Postgres database.
9.  **label:** A "label" process is applied to the fax data.
10. **Structured Data (AWS s3):** All processed and labeled data is stored as structured data in AWS S3.

**Front-End Web Application for Admins:** The clinic admin logs into the web application and makes a request for a patient's prior medical records prior to a new or follow-up visit. Today, EHR integration is not required, which can reduce initial sales cycles (more in GTM below). The team is prioritizing integrations over the next 12 months with major oncology EMR vendors OncoEMR and iKnowMed to improve utility within the clinical workflow, particularly to push data directly into the EMR.

## Page 10
**Retrieval:** The admin request triggers a Health Gorilla API call to retrieve information from the exchanges, and Solstice separately generates a fax template for non-HIE providers. Today, Solstice will typically retrieve 1000 pages of records and utilize ~20 for the final report. In areas with high HIE coverage, Health Gorilla records may be sufficient for 90% of records (Oregon), while in others its closer to 70% (New Mexico).

**Filtering:** Solstice make calls for specific resources within that patient's chart from Health Gorilla (Document References, Diagnostic Reports), combines data from non-HIE providers, and applies filters to these resources using criteria such as time stamps, keywords, and abnormal results to identify what is relevant. Solstice has already shown that they create customizable, modular filters for each clinic and for different specialties in days.

**Structuring:** Solstice combines these filtered records and creates a summary report for providers. The document still contains all documents for reference, but provides summaries of relevant labs/tests the patient has had and their results, medications the patient is on and what the most recent provider has said about the patient (HPI).

#### Solstice: Filtered / Structured Report (Image description)
The image shows two mockups: "Structured Data and History" and "Progress Notes and Reports".
The "Structured Data and History" section shows:
*   **Medications**
*   **Past Medical Problems** (with examples like "Stage if pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma," "Chronic kidney disease stage 3 anemic, unspecified," "Gastro-esophageal disease without esophagitis," "Systemic lupus erythematosus," "Other delusional disorders," "Cough, unspecified"). Each entry has a code, status (Active/Resolved), and date.
*   **Family History** (with example "Maternal grandmother's history of bone cancer").

The "Progress Notes and Reports" section shows filters available:
*   **Filter Based On**
    *   Date of Document
    *   Type of Document
    *   Provider Name
    *   Type of Appointment

### “Why Now”: Increased Data Access + Novel Data Infrastructure
Helping providers access and structure data from HIEs provides an initial wedge into these practices, while adding last-mile data from fax and EMR data provides long-term, durable moats. This approach to target community providers is now economically feasible for Solstice given advances in LLMs and healthcare data infrastructure.

## Page 11
**HIE Data as a Wedge:** HIEs are health system focused and community providers are not connected to these national exchanges today. For community providers, access to HIE data is necessary (they need data from health systems) but not sufficient (they also need to pull data from other community providers). Simply helping community providers access data from these HIEs through Health Gorilla APIs and filtering/structuring data on the back-end provides an initial avenue to provide value to practices. However, access to this data will become commoditized over time (3-5 years). As access to this national HIE data from health systems becomes table stakes, the value of the additional records from the last-mile of faxes and EMRs from community providers will only increase in value. Solstice has identified a specific moment in time to enter the market, reach scale among multiple specialties in a region, and create an interconnected network for data exchange for community providers dependent on this “last-mile” data.

**LLMs + Data Infrastructure:** Novel data infrastructure allows Solstice to build a capital efficient and scalable business unencumbered by the manual processes of incumbents that are forced to focus on health systems because of their high cost-structures. We have invested across multiple layers of the data stack (access, transformation, and insights) as well as specific applications for payers, health systems, SMB providers, and pharma (below). A novel healthcare data stack is emerging that creates an ecosystem that enables startups to build healthcare data products more quickly and efficiently. LLMs are an important tool in the toolkit that can help with back-end data engineering tasks (entity resolution, code generation and review, data transformation, etc) for structured and unstructured data. Solstice has also had conversations with Tuva (e.g., building a common data model for EMR data) and Integral (e.g., de-identification engine for data assets) to improve performance and quality of its solution in the near and long term.

Virtue Healthcare Data Market Landscape

### Commercial: High-confidence Pipeline Represents $2.3M in ARR
If Solstice only closes the 8 additional customers in pipeline who have already piloted the solution, the company can reach $2.3M in ARR. Solstice is providing an essential solution for clinic operations, increasing market pull and reducing friction for sales cycles with each clinic. Starting with oncology practices - a specialty that collaborates with numerous other specialties (urology, neurology, GI, surgery, gynecology, etc), requires complex data (pathology, labs, imaging), and has large physician group networks (US Oncology, OneOncology) - creates the first nodes for Solstice's regional and national network of data exchange for community providers.

**Pricing Model:** Solstice charges clinics a monthly subscription fee that is built up based on expected patient volume for new and follow-up visits, with discounts provided for volume. Solstice bases its subscription pricing on $10-$15 per new patients and ~$3 per follow-up visit as more records are required for new patients. The variable price per patient is simply used to determine the fixed subscription fee, as practices have different patient volumes. In other words, the subscription fee does not fluctuate based on small variations in patient volumes.

**Value Prop:** Solstice is providing cost-savings to community providers to replace their current manual processes. For other solutions that are “nice-to-haves” for clinics (RPM,

## Page 13
patient engagement, etc), cost-savings value props can be difficult. Medical record retrieval, on the other hand, is essential for clinic operations. Clinics can not run their business without it. In addition, the magnitude of performance improvement (2x the number of records) and cost-savings (80% cheaper) is significant. The essential nature of medical record retrieval and massive improvement on the current manual standard has already created strong pull for the solution.

**Current Traction/Pipeline:** Some healthcare companies target large health systems because of larger ACVs, but are stuck in longer sales cycles (18-24 months). Solstice has found the optimal “goldilocks zone” with $100K-$1M+ ACVs for clinics with sales cycles <1 month. Solstice has already sold to its first customer (Oregon Oncology; discounted pricing for design partner) in a sales process that took <4 weeks. Other groups that have already piloted the solution - including New Mexico Cancer Center (2 locations), Maryland Oncology / Hematology (14 locations), Nebraska Cancer Specialists (10 locations) - have ACVs ranging from $100K - $600K.

**Evolution of GTM Strategy:** Solstice wins over the long-term through intra/inter-regional and national expansion to create a network of community practices.

*   **Intra-Regional (Oncology First):** Cancer is a generic term for a large group of diseases that can affect any part of the body, requiring oncologists to work with

## Page 14
many different specialties (urology, neurology, GI, pathology, etc). The company has already shown with the Oregon Specialty group that this initial “node” in oncology can help them expand to do record retrieval from the other community providers they are requesting data from.

*   **Inter-Regional (Provider Networks):** Oncology is a specialty with large physician group networks with a nationwide footprint (US Oncology, AON, OneOncology, etc). Working with a US Oncology practice in Oregon (Oregon Oncology Specialists) facilitates their expansion into a US Oncology practice Maryland (Maryland Oncology Hematology). Solstice then can create a new oncology node in Maryland, and rinse and repeat the expansion strategy to other specialties in Maryland.

*   **Vendor Distribution (EMRs/PM):** Solstice can also partner with EMR vendors and practice management systems in different specialties to drive expansion. Today, the web-based application is useful in driving faster sales cycles and demonstrating initial value prop (e.g., similar to SmarterDx; another Virtue portfolio company that purposefully avoided initial EHR integration to reduce initial sales friction). In the future, EHR integrations with major oncology EMR vendors (OncoEMR from Flatiron, iKnowMed from McKesson) can further help with distribution.

### Appendix: Go-To-Market

3.  **Nationwide expansion through large-scale vendor distribution**

    *   MCKESSON

## Page 15
As this network expands, Solstice will evolve from faxes and HIE data to more EMR integrations. Luckily, the specialties they are targeting are dominated by 2-3 popular EMRs so they can get 80% coverage without dealing with the long-tail of EMR integrations. The current market share of iKnowMed and OncoEMR are representative of this dynamic. The exact technical approach will likely look similar to Switchboard does today but for community providers - a combination of flexible APIs and manual work to fill in the gaps. Solstice has the benefit of building on a 2023 technology stack without the tech debt from Ciox's historical manual processes and market timing as the next wave of interoperability unfolds.

### TAM: ~$20B Market for Records Retrieval for Community Practices
The medical record retrieval market is a large, established market ($125B annually) with scaled players like Ciox doing ~$1B in annual revenue. This gives us confidence in the size of the current market for record retrieval alone, but we dive deeper into (1) community providers specifically (2) pricing assumptions, (3) further upside potential to build applications for payers (e.g., risk adjustment) or biopharma (e.g., RWE) based on the longitudinal clinical data asset Solstice can acquire.

**Community Providers:** Through primary research with customers, Solstice estimates that on average community providers spend $108K annually today per clinic for medical record retrieval (manual processes, based on man hours/time) and there are 180K clinics nationally. This equates to a market size of $19.4B, of which technology solutions like Solstice can capture a significant portion (>50%). We pressure tested managements other assumptions with their bottoms up approach (Solstice MarketSizingCalculations in data room) that lead to a total market size of $76B assuming their current pricing structure and other Definitive Health data citing ~200k clinics in the US. We conservatively anchor around the $19.4B TAM.

**Pricing Assumptions:** The assumptions that Solstice will charge $15/new patient and ~$3/follow-up visit are fairly conservative. Ciox and other players in market are charging $30 per record. Solstice charges clinics a monthly subscription as mentioned above, but the subscription for each clinic is based on patient volume.

**Longitudinal, Last-Mile Clinical Data:** Today, healthcare data is siloed (different regional or national networks), incomplete (only from health systems), and at best cobbled together by 3rd party data brokers (e.g., Datavant). As access to certain data types from the first few waves of interoperability becomes commoditized, all healthcare

## Page 16
organizations (providers payers, pharma) will be looking for differentiated data assets. Solstice has the opportunity to create a longitudinal clinical dataset that includes valuable last-mile data, which is absent from the system today. We see additional applications for biopharma (RWE =$15B market; based on Synthetica and Integral diligence) and for payers (risk adjustment = $5B market; based on ValleySteer and Tuva diligence) that leverage Solstice's longitudinal clinical dataset only as additional upside. We mention these applications not as a requirement for growth, but to highlight the multiple avenues for growth they allow themselves in the future given the advantageous foundation they are building today.

### Competition: Gap in Companies Targeting Community Providers
Practically, Solstice is competing with manual admin work at these practices today. We laid out the competitive landscape in four buckets below to elaborate further on the dynamics in the interoperability space.

| Health System Focused | Smaller Startups | "On-ramps" to HIEs | EHRs |
| :-------------------- | :--------------- | :----------------- | :--- |
| **Ciox**<br>A DATAVANT Company<br>Founded in 1976. ~$1B in revenue with 15-20% margins. Switchboard product provides configurable API but is still ">50% manual" | **meMR**<br>$1.5M in funding from angels; $690K in ARR. Focused on concierge clinics and virtual care | **HEALTH GORILLA**<br>**particle**<br>Health Gorilla and Particle claim to differ slightly on usability and coverage but are largely similar and compete on price. These companies want to remain as "on-ramps", not do the work to onboard providers | **iKnowMed**<br>Clinical Information Solutions<br>**ONCOEMR**<br>Specialty EHRs (oncology specific above; initial focus) are not competitors but distribution partners. EHRs drive intra-operability among their own customers but not interoperability between multiple specialties and data types (fax, HIES, EMRS) |
| **MRO**<br>Founded 2002; 35K providers and 65M annual clinical records volume | **Credo**<br>$3m seed led by FirstMile; Focused on chart chasing specifically for risk adjustment | | |

**Health System Focused:** Many of these companies were founded 20+ years ago and rely on manual processes to “chase charts”. Ciox still has individuals that go to health systems and manually scan paper charts to send back for analysis. With the recent Datavant / Ciox merger, the company has been developing Switchboard as a way to automate these processes. Switchboard has a “FHIR Worker”, which “takes a configuration-first approach to handling variation” from health system to health system.

## Page 17
This is essentially a developer tool that tries to make it easier for IT admins at a health system to configure APIs for their specific EMR and health system. Industry conversations today indicate that this is still essentially a “mechanical turk” with >50% of processes still manual.

**Smaller Startups:** We've seen a number of startups (meMR, Credo, hona.ai) pitch some version of medical record retrieval with slightly different focuses. meMR had an unfocused GTM and was working with concierge/VIP primary care clinics, virtual care providers, and Science37. Credo was more focused on risk adjustment in the context of value-based care for risk-bearing entities. Technically there are slight differences, but the biggest differentiator is in the approach to collect comprehensive data beyond HIES (particularly fax) and the GTM focus.

**On-Ramps to HIEs:** Health Gorilla ($50M Series C in 2022) and Particle Health ($25M Series B) are working to innovate on the infrastructure layer (APIs to better access HIEs), not in targeting community providers to embed into their workflow. They typically work with virtual care startups or innovative brick-and-mortar providers (e.g., Oak Street). They take the messy C-CDA files (XML format) from the exchanges and transform it into JSON format, but this is still unusable by community providers and requires technical talent to normalize for clinical use.

**EHR Vendors:** iKnowMed and OncoEMR in oncology (and their equivalents in other specialties) promote intra-operability between practices that already use their EMRs, not interoperability between a wide net of community providers like Solstice. The crux of the problem is getting data from outside oncology, making Solstice's approach complementary and opening up avenues for these EMRs as distribution partners. EMRs are fundamentally built to optimize for billing and coding, and we've seen many other examples (RCM, CDS) where EMRs choose to partner vs. straying from their core capabilities.

### Financing / Milestones: Immediate Path to >$1M ARR
We walked through multiple scenarios to validate the path to $1M+ in ARR with scalable unit economics (50+%), and provide runway for 2-3 years if necessary.

**Milestones:** Solstice has a solution that is ready to sell and is focused on 3 key milestones with this round.

*   **Sell to 100 Clinic Locations:** An average organization that Solstice targets has 10 clinic locations, and there are larger organizations that Solstice is in discussions

## Page 18
*   with (e.g., Florida Cancer Specialists) with 100 locations.
*   **Evidence of KPIs for Clinics:** Initial buying decisions for practices are based on data quality/comprehensiveness (e.g., can you get us more data than we get today?). Solstice wants to demonstrate continued value to practices based on key metrics for practices including utilization, decrease in time for records retrieval, decreased appointment cancellations, and number of referrals.
*   **Establish Scalable Unit Economics:** Solstice has the opportunity to scale gross margins as the cost per patient for Health Gorilla will decrease from $4.25 with volume alone. With this round, Solstice can reduce its reliance on Health Gorilla by beginning to build out HIE connections in-house and further improve LLM structuring to reduce inference costs and reach 70-90% gross margins.

**Financials:** Solstice is a capital efficient business (potential for 70%-90% gross margins) with low OpEx, a monthly subscription model, and a strong pipeline that gives us confidence in near-term revenue ramp. The major assumptions we tested were timing of contracts, subscription ACV (e.g., new visits only vs. new and follow-up visits), excluding large groups (e.g., Florida Cancer specialists), and differing gross margin profile over the next 6 quarters.

*   **Virtue Base Case:** We assume subscription pricing is based on new and follow-up patient volume, Florida Cancer Specialists is not included, all contracts are delayed by at least 6 months, and gross margins improved slightly compared to the conservative scenario. The biggest impact in the conservative vs. base case is including follow-up patient visits, leading to $4M in ARR in 18 months with positive net profit in Q1 2025.

### Opportunities / Risks

#### Opportunities
*   **High-Gross Margin, Capital Efficient Healthcare Data Business:** A data businesses in healthcare like Solstice provides the best of both worlds - the potential for high gross-margins (70-90%) and recurring revenue from the SaaS world, plus the stickiness of healthcare customers (e.g., less likely to rip and replace). While in the early days Solstice has a lower margin profile, the company has line of sight to 60+% gross margins simply through increased volume. Over time, reducing its reliance on Health Gorilla and building its own integrations and increasing automation through EHR integrations will only further increase margins (70-90%).
*   **Early Momentum in Untapped Market:** Community providers are not connected to the HIEs today and no vendors currently are building for their specific needs. The current pipeline provides compelling early evidence of strong market pull, and there is a moment in time over the next 2-3 years to scale rapidly to own a market-defining community provider data exchange network. The “nodes” that Solstice can build within different specialties and different regions have compounding network effects that make Solstice only more valuable with each node it adds.
*   **Longitudinal Clinical Dataset Built on Modern Infrastructure:** Solstice has the opportunity to build out a longitudinal clinical dataset for the last-mile of data assets that no other data provider has access to today. Solstice can build out this network from day 1 with a modern data infrastructure and interoperability tailwinds leveraging a Ciox-like playbook, without having to build up decades of manual processes that is encumbering Ciox today. The future of healthcare data will continue to evolve as access to historical datasets becomes commoditized, and new companies like Solstice provide additional valuable datasets and the insights to actually make the data useful.

#### Risks (+ mitigation strategies)
*   **Community Provider GTM:** Selling to community providers vs. larger enterprises (health systems, payers, etc) can lead to a fragmented GTM strategy for some digital health startups, especially those with “nice-to-have” solutions (e.g., remote patient monitoring, patient engagement, etc). Solstice, on the other hand, is building a medical record retrieval solution that is essential for community provider's

## Page 21
workflow today, has already shown rapid integration/implementation timelines, and improves on current solutions by orders of magnitude (not 10-20% that you have to squint to believe). This value prop has resonated strongly with initial customers and those in the pipeline, and our conversations with community providers confirm that this strategy will remain durable over time as these pain points are only getting more acute.

*   **Demonstrating Sustainable Value Prop to Buyer:** A network of community providers is only valuable if providers are actually using the solution. There is potential risk that as Solstice ramps its growth to new community providers to build out its network, current customers will reduce utilization. Solstice has already shown, however, that they can customize the solution to match a providers specific needs in hours. Building modular filters to customize to a provider's workflows or need and altering the summarization report are examples of high-value tactics to drive continued utilization that are easy for Solstice given the platform they have built to-date.

*   **Failure to Move Beyond Oncology:** Solstice can build a capital efficient medical record retrieval business in oncology alone, but that does not help the company accomplish its vision to build a data exchange network for all community providers. While this is a key risk that Virtue and management recognize, Solstice has already demonstrated this specialty expansion in Oregon. This early evidence of the approach is what triggered a fundraise in the first place. Our work in other specialties (GI, neuro, OB-GYN, derm, primary care, etc) have emphasized this pain point outside of oncology and give us confidence, and the strong referral networks Solstice is already seeing on its platform only further solidify that view.
