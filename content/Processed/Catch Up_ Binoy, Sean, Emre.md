### Fundraising Decision - Taking Transformation Capital Offer

- Transformation Capital offering $15M on $75M post-valuation
	- Team voted to accept the deal
	- Term expires Monday
	- Covering $50k of their legal fees
- Original goal was $20-25M at higher valuation
	- Market reality: fundraising tough unless leveraging AI
	- Taking 15 now vs rolling dice on higher round later
- Future fundraising positioning stronger after proving Anna model works
	- Bridge to profitability with current raise
	- Next round targeting $50M+ after demonstrating success

### Anna Business Growth Strategy

- Focus: laser-focused on proving out Anna first (profitable, multi-state, multi-specialty)
	- Success of Anna is prerequisite for Blueprint expansion
	- Units opened in Massachusetts are ramping
	- New markets licensed: Minnesota and Missouri LOI signed, legal diligence underway
- Transformation Capital aligned on Blueprint vision but giving no credit in current valuation
- Path forward: get Anna to $50M+ ARR, then expand Blueprint
	- Blueprint development timeline: 18 months from initiation to meaningful traction
	- Risk of distraction vs opportunity cost debated

### Board Structure and Governance

- Proposed board composition: 2 common, 2 preferred, 1 additional common seat
	- Transformation gets 1 board seat with Akanksha as observer
	- Virtue retains board control with Binoy and potential third member (Becky)
- ESOP: currently 6.9%, targeting 7-10% (minimal dilution impact)
- Pro rata considerations for SPV managed but shouldn’t hold up deal

### Next Steps and Compensation

- Aimun’s compensation increase approved
	- Not contingent on fundraise closing
	- Recognition of performance beyond expectations
- Legal counsel recommendations needed for deal closure
- Term sheet review: negotiate observer seat vs formal board seat if possible
- Close diligence process to begin immediately
