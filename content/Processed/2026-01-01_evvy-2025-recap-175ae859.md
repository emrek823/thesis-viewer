# Evvy 2025 Year in Review

2025 was a pivotal year for Evvy.

We crossed the threshold from promise to proof, demonstrating that our vaginal microbiome platform can scale clinically, commercially, and operationally — all while materially strengthening the fundamentals of the business.

We will close the year at ~$13.5M in revenue (up from $7.67M last year), driven by expanded products, indications, and channels — alongside step-change improvements in margin and LTV.

Evvy has now served ~90,000 patients, run ~125,000 tests, and built the world's largest, clinically validated vaginal microbiome dataset. What began as a best-in-class diagnostic has evolved into a growing platform for precision female health.

# Product Velocity: From Test to Platform

2025 was a year of exceptional product velocity. Across the board, we saw the same pattern: when Evvy launches products, customers adopt them.

Major launches this year included:

*   **Women's Complete Probiotic** — ~25% attachment with strong subscription uptake
*   **UTI+ Test** — Evvy's first diagnostic expansion (beat monthly forecast in its first week)
*   **Fertility Insights** — powered by Evvy's data and included with every test result — fertility is now the fastest-growing reason people come to Evvy
*   **Male Partner BV Treatment** — reducing BV recurrence (>10% of women diagnosed with BV are now also getting treatment for their male partner)
*   **Paraben-free Estradiol Cream (vaginal estrogen)** — comprehensive approach to symptom relief in menopause
*   **Vaginal Probiotic Suppositories** — now one of our top-selling Rx products
*   **Rx Subscriptions** — ~20% of post-test Rx orders now include a subscription to at least one Rx product

Together, these launches increased AOV, LTV, and recurring revenue — transforming Evvy from a single diagnostic into a multi-product ecosystem.

# Fertility: The First Platform Expansion

Fertility emerged as a clear proof point of Evvy's cross-indication platform potential.

*   ~10% of new customers now cite fertility as their primary motivation for testing
*   **Fertility-focused providers** (REIs, fertility naturopaths, integrative clinics) are our fastest-growing provider segment
*   **US Fertility** invested in Evvy and is partnering with us on our IVF outcomes study — rare validation from the largest fertility clinic network in the U.S.
*   Using data from our landmark IVF study, Evvy is training an algorithm to predict IVF success using vaginal microbiome markers. We expect initial data in January and final results in Q2.

Fertility patients also demonstrate higher AOV and stronger margin profiles, reinforcing fertility as both a compelling clinical indication and a meaningful growth vector.

# Clinical Credibility Meets Real World Scale

We moved from promise to proof:

*   Published a **peer-reviewed outcomes study** on >1,000 real-world patients, demonstrating significant symptom improvement and reduced recurrence
*   Outcomes data shows **>75% symptom improvement** across scaled cohorts of tens of thousands of patients
*   Providers increasingly view Evvy as the **gold standard** for vaginal microbiome testing, driving inbound adoption (>8% of DTC patients heard about us from their doctor)
*   Evvy was invited to **present at preeminent clinical and scientific conferences** (including ASRM, ACOG, and IDSOG) to share novel insights from the world's largest vaginal microbiome dataset.

As our dataset scaled, we began translating real-world data into clinically meaningful insights:

*   **Root cause clarity**: ~90% of symptomatic patients identify a potential root cause with their first Evvy test
*   **Fertility "hidden barriers"**: ~46% of patients with unexplained infertility had a treatable vaginal microbiome imbalance; ~75% of asymptomatic infertility patients had disrupted microbiomes
*   **UTI root cause**: ~47% of patients reporting a recent UTI had UTI-associated bacteria present in the vaginal microbiome

# Proof of Compounding Economics

We unlocked several structural improvements across the business:

*   **Gross margin** expanded to ~35% (up from 25% in 2024), driven by higher-margin product mix, pricing discipline, and operational efficiency — with a path to 50%+ post-Series B
*   **Care (Rx) revenue** grew >150% YoY, reflecting stronger conversion, repeat behavior, and new care onramps
*   **Care (Rx) conversion** increased to ~33% (up from ~23% baseline) following diagnosis-at-results and a more transparent care experience
*   **Gross profit LTV** grew >50% in 2025 and >100% since Series A, supported by subscriptions, repeat purchases, and new product experiences

These gains came while operating under real constraints earlier in the year — including platform disruptions in paid acquisition and limited growth spend — underscoring the resilience of Evvy's model.

# Building the Team to Scale

In parallel, we nearly doubled the team in 2025, adding exceptional talent across product, engineering, data, clinical, and marketing to support the next phase of growth.

A key milestone was welcoming Kwame Thomison as CTO. His leadership has already strengthened our technical foundation, accelerated product velocity, and positioned Evvy to scale more reliably with AI-driven experiences.

# The Proprietary Data Advantage

Underpinning this progress is Evvy's proprietary data and technology infrastructure tailored to the vaginal microbiome:

*   **VaMOS** — our bioinformatics pipelines
*   **SAGE** — our reference database built from Evvy-discovered genomes
*   **V-SCAN** — our predictive models leveraging genomic and clinical data

Every test strengthens this platform, enabling new scores, new indications, and the foundation for **AI-driven, personalized care at scale** — including the IVF predictive models we will launch next year.

# Leading the conversation in women's health

In 2025, we continued to establish ourselves as a category leader in women's health. Our work was featured in top-tier outlets including Forbes, Fast Company, and WWD, and Evvy was recognized with industry honors such as HLTH's Rising Star Award in Women's Health, Inc's Top Female Founders, NY Digital Health's DH 100, and EY's Entrepreneur Of The Year Finalist.

Evvy also convened the broader ecosystem for Equal Research Day, bringing together clinicians, policymakers, media, and industry leaders to spotlight the gender health gap and advance more inclusive research.

This visibility has translated directly into business momentum — accelerating provider adoption, deepening partner interest, and reinforcing Evvy's position as the **go-to platform for the vaginal microbiome**.

2025 was the year Evvy proved the platform works at scale, with rigor.

2026 is the year it compounds.

We feel incredibly lucky to be building Evvy alongside all of you. Thank you for your partnership and continued belief in what we're building.
