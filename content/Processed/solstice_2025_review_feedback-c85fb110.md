# Solstice 2025 Review Feedback: The Pivot Paid Off

Review Date: 2026-01-04 | Source Mix: 95% Vault (Meeting Notes + Deck) / 5% Memo | Confidence: HIGH

The Take: Solstice executed one of the most dramatic pivots in the Virtue portfolio—from medical record retrieval for community oncology ($0 ARR at pivot) to biopharma content commercialization ($2.3M ARR in 4 months). They signed their first pharma customer in September 2025 and scaled to ~$2M contracted ARR by December with zero pre-existing biopharma relationships. The velocity is remarkable: $110K→$650K→$2.3M ARR across Q3-Q4-Q1. The 2026 raise ($15M to get to $15M ARR) depends on two things: (1) can they expand within accounts (land→expand), and (2) can they productize enough to avoid becoming an agency. Both are real risks—but the team has earned the right to try.

## The Pivot & What Actually Happened

### Original Investment Thesis (Oct 2023)

What we wrote in the memo:

"Solstice offers community providers an easy-to-use web interface and automates back-end processing for medical record retrieval to gather 2x the records in 3-5 minutes for 80% cheaper."

### What Actually Happened

The medical records business didn't scale. By mid-2025, Solstice had pivoted entirely to biopharma content commercialization—helping pharma companies create compliant marketing content 100x faster than agencies.

Why the pivot worked:

Founders had 0 biopharma experience and 0 pre-existing relationships

Still closed $2.3M ARR in 4 months through pure hustle

Value prop is 100x better (minutes vs months), not 10-20% improvement

Pharma has massive content bottleneck and agencies are existentially threatened

## Financial Performance & Trajectory

### Revenue Trajectory

### Signed & Pipeline Breakdown (Dec 11, 2025)

Signed: | Customer | ARR | Status | |----------|-----|--------| | Phathom | $110K | Live | | Nuvation | $300K | Signed, onboarding | | Ipsen | $180K | Live | | Incyte | $11K | Signed (room to expand) |

SOW Expecting Signatures: | Customer | Initial | Potential ARR | Notes | |----------|---------|---------------|-------| | Alexion gMG | $100K | $350K | | | AstraZeneca Camizestrant | $100K | | | | Sanofi | $220K TCV | $532K ARR | 3 brands (Dupixent, Befortus, General Medicines) | | UCB | $73K TCV | $292K ARR | 3 months initial | | Ardelyx | $395K | | |

Total Pipeline: ~$2.02M ARR / $1.49M TCV (not including Pfizer Medical Affairs + Takeda)

### Key Metrics (Nov 26, 2025)

## What's Working

### 1. Sales Velocity is Exceptional

From Sept 17 meeting notes:

"Phathom: 3 year MSA - $118k/year for one brand"

From Oct 15:

"Nuvation Bio: Agreed to $300k ACV initially for HCP marketing (first attempt at higher ACVs)"

From Nov 12:

"End of year we will hit $1M ARR. Goal for end of 2026 is $10-15mm ARR and at least 1 'Whale' (~$5M ACV customer)"

Sales cycle: 2 months end-to-end (Nuvation). Some deals closing in weeks.

### 2. ICP is Clearly Defined

From July 2025 notes:

"ICP: Mid Cap Companies selling specialty drugs with 1-10 drugs in the market. HCP brand marketing directors have control over budgets at these companies, they are cost sensitive but can't build content in-house due to personnel constraints."

### 3. Land-and-Expand Motion is Emerging

Sanofi progression:

Started with 3 brands ($100K/year)

Now discussing 41 brands potential

Path to $500K+ ACV within single account

Alexion/AstraZeneca:

Initial $200K ACV → company-wide presentation for additional brands

### 4. Managed Service Model Reduces Friction

From deck:

"Solstice is not just a platform, we recreate the white-glove experience biopharma is used to."

Now: 15-20 people per client, $10-50k per digital piece, 2+ months to execute

Solstice: 1 engagement lead per 5 clients, zero variable costs per piece, idea to MLR within an hour

This is smart—pharma marketers are used to talking to humans. Don't force behavior change upfront.

### 5. Competitive Positioning is Strong

From deck:

"We are the only technology built for pharma, without the baggage of an existing business model"

Agencies (Real Chemistry, Omnicom) face innovator's dilemma. Veeva is distracted by Salesforce battle. Generic AI tools (ChatGPT, Adobe) can't handle regulatory complexity.

## Concerns & Open Questions

### 1. The Agency Risk

From the deck (Slide 15 - "Your Bet"):

"Can we sufficiently productize? Otherwise, we risk becoming an agency."

This is the existential question. Right now:

1 engagement lead per 5 clients

"White-glove experience"

Managed service model

This works at $2M ARR with 10 clients. Does it work at $15M ARR with 30 clients?

Questions:

What % of revenue is platform vs. services?

What's the gross margin breakdown (LLM costs vs. human costs)?

How many engagement leads do you need at $15M ARR?

### 2. Expansion Risk

From the deck:

"Now that we've landed can we expand? It's a necessity to build a generational company"

Early evidence is promising (Sanofi 3→41 brands potential), but:

What's the actual conversion rate from initial brand to multi-brand?

How long does expansion take?

What triggers expansion (success metrics, champion advocacy)?

### 3. Head of Sales Still Open

From Nov 12 notes:

"Head of Sales (using some contingency-based agencies and have interviewed a few people but no one we are thrilled about)"

From Nov 26:

"Greg Lewis - like this guy for potential head of sales"

Question: Has Greg been hired? This is critical for the $15M ARR goal.

### 4. Whale Dependency

From Nov 12:

"Goal for end of 2026 is $10-15mm ARR and at least 1 'Whale' (~$5M ACV customer)"

A $5M ACV customer would be 33-50% of target ARR. That's significant concentration risk.

Questions:

Which customer is the whale target? (Pfizer? Takeda?)

What's the sales cycle for a $5M deal?

Is this realistic in 2026?

### 5. Burn Rate Increased Significantly

50% increase in 3 months. This is expected with growth, but:

What's driving the increase? (Headcount? LLM costs? Client delivery?)

What's projected burn at $15M raise?

## Axis 5: The Raise

### Proposed Terms

From deck:

"We are raising $15M to get to $15M ARR"

### Hiring Plan

### Math Check

Target: $15M ARR from 30 biopharma at $500K avg ACV

Current state:

~10 signed/in-pipeline customers

~$200K current avg ACV

Need to 2.5x ACV and 3x customer count

Assumptions that need to hold:

ACVs expand from $200K → $500K (land-and-expand works)

Sales velocity maintains at ~3 new customers/quarter

Productization keeps margins healthy as you scale

Whale deal closes

## Questions to Pose in Response

### On Business Model

What % of current revenue is platform-delivered vs. engagement-lead-delivered (services)?

What's the path to 1 engagement lead per 10+ clients? What needs to be productized?

What are gross margins today? What's the split between LLM costs vs. human delivery costs?

### On Expansion

What's the actual conversion rate from 1-brand customer to multi-brand?

What triggers expansion? Champion advocacy? Measurable ROI? Brand team pulling in other brands?

Sanofi is at 3 brands with 41 brand potential. What's the realistic timeline to capture more?

### On Sales & Pipeline

Has Greg Lewis (or anyone) been hired as Head of Sales?

Which customer is the $5M "whale" target? What's the realistic timeline?

Pfizer and Takeda are mentioned as "not included" in projections. What's the status?

### On Productization

The deck says "Using Solstice is faster + easier than emailing an agency" — is this true today, or is that the future state?

What are the biggest blockers to a customer using the platform directly without an engagement lead?

### On Competitive Dynamics

Real Chemistry does $600M+ ARR. What would it take for them to build this? Are they trying?

Veeva is mentioned as "distracted." What if they enter this space?

## Summary Assessment

### What Solstice Got Right

Pivot decisiveness: Killed the medical records business cleanly, went all-in on biopharma content

Sales velocity: $0 → $2.3M ARR in 4 months with no prior pharma relationships

ICP clarity: Mid-cap pharma, 1-10 drugs, brand marketing directors with budget control

Managed service wedge: Smart to not force behavior change upfront

Competitive timing: Agencies have innovator's dilemma, AI makes this possible now

### What Needs Sharpening

Productization path: Clear articulation of how platform replaces engagement leads over time

Expansion proof points: Need concrete data on multi-brand conversion rates and timelines

Head of Sales: Critical hire still open

Margin visibility: Need to understand services vs. platform contribution

Whale realism: $5M ACV deal in 2026 is ambitious—need to see clear path

### Bull Case

Solstice becomes the "Canva for biopharma content"—every brand team at every pharma company uses Solstice to create compliant content in minutes. Land-and-expand works (Sanofi goes from 3→41 brands), ACVs grow to $1M+, and pharma consolidates content spend on Solstice as agencies decline. $15M ARR by EOY 2026 is a stepping stone to $50M+ as the platform becomes self-serve.

### Bear Case

The managed service model doesn't scale. Engagement leads become a bottleneck. Gross margins compress as human delivery costs grow faster than revenue. Expansion is slower than expected (brand teams are siloed, champions leave). The "whale" deal slips. Real Chemistry or Veeva responds aggressively. $15M ARR becomes $8M ARR and the company is a well-capitalized agency, not a platform.

## Appendix: Key Quotes from Meeting Notes

On the pivot (July 2025):

"We've seen interest from biopharma companies boom... We've signed 4 MSAs with biopharma companies in the last 2 weeks alone"

On sales motion (July 2025):

"First Call: We will ingest a brand's healthcare provider and leverage this to understand brand style requirements, approved images and claims and then leverage these to make an email for the brand live in front of the team to showcase the value"

On ICP (July 2025):

"ICP: Mid Cap Companies selling specialty drugs with 1-10 drugs in the market. HCP brand marketing directors have control over budgets at these companies and can make purchasing decisions"

On the challenge (June 2025):

"Behavior Change would be large as most biopharma don't create content themselves and it's a new skillset they need to build. Many don't really even care about the tech, they just want their content to be faster, cheaper and better."

On the bet (Dec 2025 deck):

"You are betting on our ability to expand within an organization and sufficiently productize"
