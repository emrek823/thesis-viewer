### Hisabba Evolution: From Biller Services to Direct Provider RCM

- Initial focus on untouched market of small-medium outsourced billing companies (mom-pop shops to teams of hundreds)
	- Raised pre-seed on thesis of serving underserved builders market
	- Found companies with single digit margins signing multi-year contracts
	- Change management extremely difficult with cost-focused SMB mindset vs growth investment
- Structural problems discovered with biller partnerships
	- Billers wouldn’t run eligibility checks despite low API costs due to contractual incentives
	- Customer contracts explicitly blamed providers for bad insurance info, even charged for denied claims
	- Misaligned incentives prevented AI-first, tech-forward workflows
- Pivoted to end-to-end AI services model
	- Control entire workflow from data collection to claim reconciliation
	- Human-in-the-loop for complex denials, onboarding, and specialty-specific SOPs
	- Customers want complete offloading, not just software platforms requiring button-clicking
	- Differentiator vs Candid/Adonis: full service ownership rather than feature automation

### Pharmacy Medical Billing Focus

- 90% of product/go-to-market efforts now focused on pharmacists doing medical billing
	- Expanded scope of practice across most states enables EM codes, vaccine administration
	- Medical claims significantly more lucrative than drug PBM claims
	- Dispensing margin model is dying/already negative for many pharmacies
- Market opportunity parallels primary care RCM from 10 years ago
	- Pharmacists well-positioned: licensure + physical retail locations + commercial/Medicaid credentialing access
	- Most never adopted RCM solutions or use outdated consulting-built systems
	- Problems aren’t new, but specialty application requires different implementation approach
- Current traction: 16 pharmacy locations, growing 20% monthly
- Similar expansion patterns seen in ABA therapy, doulas expanding from private pay to insurance reimbursement

### Next Steps

- Sam will send updated investment memo within next week
- Follow-up conversation planned after memo review
- Sam traveling to NYC next month for potential in-person meeting
- Fundraise kicking off this month targeting investors who understand AI services model vs traditional SaaS
