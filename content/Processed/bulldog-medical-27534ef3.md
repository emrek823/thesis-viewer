## Slide 1: Bulldog Medical
Bulldog Medical
Diagnosing cancer early to save lives

Pre-seed Pitch Deck
Fall 2024

Bulldog Medical, the nation's first digital oncology practice, delivers rapid cancer diagnoses that massively improve outcomes, save lives, and reduce costs

## Slide 2: Bulldog Medical - Executive Summary
Bulldog Medical - Executive Summary

1.  **Market Size:** Cancer is the 2nd leading cause of death in the United States with 2 million new cases annually. Costs are estimated to reach $250B per year by 2030
2.  **Opportunity:** Early diagnosis is the most effective way to save lives and reduce costs
3.  **Problem:** However, a cancer work-up and diagnosis takes over 5 months on average, with 16% of diagnoses exceeding 6 months.
4.  **Solution:** Bulldog Medical, the nation's first digital oncology practice, delivers rapid cancer diagnoses that massively improve outcomes, save lives, and reduce costs
5.  **Tech and scale:** Our tech-enabled service enables quality, scale, speed, and industry defining visibility to patients
6.  **Traction:** We have kicked off a payor/provider pilot with a large metropolitan Federally Qualified Healthcare Center and a large, national payor, leading to a bundled payment contract
7.  **Economics:** Starting in Medicaid, we have a clear path to $10M ARR in 3 years at 75% gross margins. We plan to expand to MA, Commercial, and Employer as we grow
8.  **Team:** Our fit for purpose team has already delivered this model; now we are scaling
9.  **Fundraise:** We are raising $2M in pre-seed funding via a SAFE to deliver on our mission to diagnose all patients as quickly and as early as possible. Our aspiration is to build the largest cancer diagnostic clinic in the United States

## Slide 3: Cancer has a major impact on society in the United States
1. Market Size
Cancer has a major impact on society in the United States

As of 2024, each year
*   20M patients require a work-up and diagnosis
*   2M patients receive a cancer diagnosis
*   $200B+ spent on cancer

40% of us will be diagnosed with cancer in our lifetimes

## Slide 4: Early, fast diagnosis is proven to save lives and reduce costs

## Slide 5: But the path to a diagnosis is tortuous, fragmented, and too slow
3. Problem
But the path to a diagnosis is tortuous, fragmented, and too slow

**5+ Months to diagnosis**

*   **Complex**
    *   A cancer scare and diagnostic path is overwhelming for a patient
    *   Standards of care are constantly changing making it complex for providers

*   **Understaffed**
    *   PCP shortages blocks entry into the system
    *   Limited access to oncologists exacerbates the problem - 66% of counties do not have an oncologist

*   **Misaligned incentives**
    *   Facility fees can increase the cost of routine services 3-fold
    *   Treatment is very expensive (and lucrative); diagnosis and prevention is not

*   **Coordination left to patients and PCPs**
    *   Oncologists are often involved too late in diagnosis, if at all
    *   PCPs carry the burden of orchestrating the work-up
    *   SDoH often limits access to timely care

*   **Process delays**
    *   A simple doctor visit with labs averages over 3½ hours
    *   The system creates delays based on standard issue wait times and policies

## Slide 6: Bulldog Medical solves this with oncologist led digital diagnosis
4. Solution
Bulldog Medical solves this with oncologist led digital diagnosis

**~4 Weeks with Bulldog**

*   **Lead with Bulldog Oncologists**
    *   Only oncology providers can triage, order tests, interpret diagnostic results, and advocate as their patient's "Bulldog"
    *   Bulldog flips the current model by starting with the cancer specialist
    *   We show patients "the forest before the trees"

*   **Leverage telehealth**
    *   During Covid, we discovered that we could complete entire cancer work-ups using telehealth
    *   We engage patients within 24 hours on their terms based on their schedule

*   **Coordinate for patients**
    *   Daily life exists before, during, and after cancer
    *   Patients and caregivers deserve respect and support
    *   We manage all scheduling, coordination and patient prep for diagnostic tests

*   **Group diagnostics**
    *   If patients have transportation issues or require caregivers present why make separate trips?
    *   We group and sequence tests to improve access and affordability

*   **Make a Bulldog Game Plan**
    *   At the end of our diagnostic sprint we pass the baton
    *   That baton is called the "Bulldog Game Plan," which includes all necessary information to guide management
    *   We share the Bulldog Game Plan with the patient, the PCP, and the treating oncology team to ensure continuity of care
