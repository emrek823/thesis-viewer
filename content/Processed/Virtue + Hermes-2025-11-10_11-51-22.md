### Demand - Records Coming In

- CZ Law now active, generating 25 records/day since Thursday
	- $50 per record for billing documentation + $50 for medical records
	- System working 90% effectively with minor issues (billing research, routing, HIPAA authorization pickup)
	- Contract worth ~$250k annually for one lawyer
	- Requires 2 operations staff at $70k each (50% margin per record)
- Second law firm about to be added
- Veritas API fully integrated - one-button patient lookup capability
	- 65% coverage rate for encounters, finding 9/10 patients but limited recent data
	- Shaheer’s data quality below expectations, missing 2025 data
	- Actually beneficial as creates need for additional data sources
- Anovolon deal nearly finalized
	- 150M records, $10k upfront + $3.30 per patient
	- Payer-sourced data (different from clearinghouse sources like Office Ally/Waystar)
	- Combined with Shaheer’s data creates robust Site Sonar solution

### Custodian Strategy & Roadmap

- Strong requester demand established: CZ Law, Chart Squatch, Keller Post, Stephen New
- Main investor feedback (Primary Torch, GC, Entwine, Upfront): need custodian traction proof
- Current signed custodians: Veritas, Waystar, Sharecare
- By January 2026 pipeline:
	- Confirmed: MRO, Anovolon, Office Ally, Healthmark
	- 50% chance: Virzma, SSI
- Pharmacy partnerships progressing: Walgreens, CVS, Kroger, Giant Eagle interested
	- First movers in identified healthcare space for pharmacy data
- 2026 coverage targets by vertical:
	- Provider data (Site Sonar): 90% coverage maintained
	- Medical/RX claims: 40% → 80% (identified format)
	- Raw medical records: 20% → 70% automation
	- Imaging: Begin buildout
- Authorization validation layer emerging as key differentiator
	- Custodians want compliance platform vs direct deals
	- Hermes becomes trusted validation middleware
	- Patient matching collision scores via Experian partnership concept

### Fundraising Timeline & Next Steps

- Burn rate increasing from $40k → $60k monthly (additional engineer + operations hire needed)
- Runway shortened from September to June 2025
- Ready to raise $3-5M seed round
- Trigger milestones for market entry: MRO + Anovolon + Office Ally signed
- Investor meetings: SF trip for Entwine and GC, Anant at General Catalyst next week

Action Items:

- Alejandro: Connect with Caviar for deck redesign (Sean to make intro Wednesday)
- Alejandro: Create Google spreadsheet for investor target list with team input
- Sean: Provide Caviar contact details and additional design firm options
- Team: Plan 10-15 investor intros for pre-January formal fundraise
