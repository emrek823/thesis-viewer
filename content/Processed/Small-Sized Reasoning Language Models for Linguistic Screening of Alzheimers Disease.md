## Abstract

Alzheimers disease (AD) is increasing in prevalence, and early detection is essential for timely care. Clinical services face growing demand, leading to delays in diagnostic appointments and increasing the risk of disease progression before evaluation. This work examines artificial intelligence (AI) methods for assessing cognitive status from linguistic features. The proposed architecture uses small language models (SLMs) to analyze speech patterns, and its compact design allows deployment on mobile devices. Recent reasoning-focused models, including Deepseek-R1 and Llama, were evaluated for dementia classification. Multiple fine-tuning strategies were compared, and the best model achieved 91% accuracy and an F1 score. The findings show that AI systems built on SLMs can achieve performance comparable to large language models, indicating their potential as efficient tools that may support health care providers through accessible pre-clinical screening for AD.
