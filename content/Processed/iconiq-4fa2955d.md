## Slide 5: Methodology & Data Sources

**ICONIQ**

**Methodology & Data Sources¹**

All views included have been aggregated or anonymized to protect the data privacy of individual companies.

Unless otherwise indicated, references to “software companies", "AI-native companies”, “AI-enabled companies” and “non-AI companies” only reflect trends observed with the companies included in the core dataset. In addition, throughout the report we have categorized companies based on their AI product maturity:

**AI-Native**
Companies whose core product or business model is fundamentally AI-driven

**AI-Enabled**
SaaS companies creating new AI products or adding AI capabilities to existing customer facing products

**Non-AI**
SaaS companies without AI products or features

**N-sizes²**
Each datapoint (n) represents a single fiscal quarter of data per company included. A given company's quarterly datapoints can be included multiple times in aggregated views (for example, by ARR scale) where we have more historical data.

**Public Companies**
The dataset includes 10 public companies that are not (and have not previously been) our venture and growth portfolio companies. All data was collected from public filings information³. These companies were categorized as top IPO performers because they ranked in the top quartile in two or more of the following criteria:
1.  Indication of Success of IPO: Forward Revenue Multiple at IPO
2.  Indication of Success Post-IPO: Current Forward Revenue Multiple
3.  Indication of Value Creation: Ratio of Change in Stock Price Since Day 1 Close vs. Market (S&P)

**Additional Data Sources**
Where noted, we have supplemented our core analysis with various proprietary ICONIQ surveys and publicly available information. These sources include:
1.  ICONIQ Gen AI Survey (April 2025), n = 300
2.  ICONIQ proprietary survey of GTM executives (April 2025), n = 205
3.  ICONIQ Annual Growth Operating Trends Survey (March 2025), n = 58

1 The conclusions of this study represent the views of the ICONIQ Venture and Growth Portfolio Analytics team and are not intended to serve as an analysis of the value, viability or health of any individual company or group of companies, and should not be used to make any decision about whether to invest in any company or group of companies, including through a private fund

## Slide 7: Executive Summary

**Executive Summary**

## Slide 8: Public Market Context: Efficient Growth Has Become the Primary Signal, and AI is Reshaping Expectations

**ICONIQ**

**Public Market Context: Efficient Growth Has Become the Primary Signal, and AI is Reshaping Expectations**

Following two years of macro-driven volatility and performance misses, the public software market is beginning to show signs of stabilization, underpinned by improved forecasting, better execution, and rising investor confidence in AI tailwinds

*   Public company valuation multiples remain below historical peaks, but early signs point to renewed investor appetite for high-growth companies
*   The Rule of 40 has emerged as the strongest predictor of valuation, with correlation to public multiples consistently surpassing growth or NRR over the last year
*   However, growth still commands a premium: A 1-point increase in revenue growth has ~2x the impact on valuation compared to an equivalent increase in FCF margin

But while macro uncertainty persists, companies are adapting, and AI is becoming a counterweight to broader caution:

*   Beat rates are recovering: Median beat vs. guidance is ~2.2% in Q1 2025, suggesting software companies are generally managing volatility, and some are beginning to benefit from AI-driven demand
*   AI is now a pervasive theme: 94% of public earnings calls mention AI, with rising focus on “AI agents” and tangible product investments
*   Private markets are doubling down: AI company funding in 1H 2025 (~$377B) has already exceeded the amount in all of 2024, reflecting strong conviction in the next frontier of software

After a turbulent reset period, the market is recalibrating - rewarding companies that demonstrate not just growth and discipline, but also a credible AI strategy. Investors are anchoring on efficiency today across the broader software market, but placing option value on an AI-fueled upside tomorrow. We are also seeing AI-native companies redefine the growth curve, reshaping expectations across the market, and emerge with a new playbook.

## Slide 9: Software Fundamentals: Stabilizing Topline, Improving Efficiency

**ICONIQ**

**Software Fundamentals: Stabilizing Topline, Improving Efficiency**

As market volatility abates, software fundamentals are showing signs of equilibrium. While top-line momentum remains uneven, companies are driving meaningful bottom-line improvements through efficiency-first execution.

*   ARR growth has leveled off across the broader software market; green shoots are emerging in mid-stage ($50-100M ARR) companies
*   Net dollar retention is settling at a ~110-120% range, particularly strong among early-stage companies; churn and downsell remain stable

Efficiency metrics are starting to show real traction:

*   CAC payback remains extended at ~16 months for top quartile companies, but appears to have plateaued
*   Rule of 40 is holding at ~50%, with FCF now contributing ~45% of the composite - a reversal from growth-dominated years
*   Net magic number has stopped declining, signaling GTM efficacy is stabilizing
*   ARR per FTE is improving, and outpaces OpEx per FTE, indicating real leverage from org redesigns, AI tooling, and workforce shifts

**The New Levers of Efficiency: AI and Workforce Redesign**

Beneath the improving metrics is a broader operational transformation. Companies are not just cutting costs – they are rewiring how they scale.

*   AI adoption is nearly universal: 80% of companies report active experimentation or implementation of internal AI tools across workflows, with adoption expected to grow through 2026
*   Offshoring is also accelerating, with offshore headcount rising from 24% to 30% of the workforce YoY, particularly in engineering and support roles

These shifts are translating into real outcomes:

*   High AI adopters report improvements across key sales efficiency and R&D productivity indicators
*   Burn multiples are gradually improving, as automation and labor arbitrage increase productivity

## Slide 10: Age of AI: A New Operating Model Is Emerging

**ICONIQ**

**Age of AI: A New Operating Model Is Emerging**

AI is no longer just a product feature – we believe it is reshaping the entire operating model of modern software companies, from how products are built to how revenue is captured, teams are structured, and value is measured.

AI-native companies are redefining the growth curve - scaling 2-3x faster, more leanly, and more efficiently than traditional SaaS peers. They reach $100M ARR in just 1-2 years, often with fewer than 20 employees, and convert trials at nearly double the industry rate.

But these outcomes are not just the result of product velocity - they stem from a fundamentally different go-to-market and organizational playbook.

AI-native companies are dedicating more GTM headcount to post-sales and utilizing forward-deployed engineers to bridge the gap between AI capabilities and business impact. AI-native companies are also building high-leverage teams, prioritizing R&D headcount and technical fluency.

Importantly, this playbook is not limited to AI-first startups. Incumbents are also showing signs of renewed growth by embedding AI deeply into their existing product line, suggesting that disruption is not inevitable - and execution still wins.

Even in an AI-transformed environment, the fundamentals of enduring software businesses still apply - growth, retention, efficiency, and scalability. But the bar has been raised. The winning teams are adapting those fundamentals to a faster, more technical, and AI-native world. We believe the ICONIQ Enterprise Five remain reliable markers of excellence across scale. What is changing is how quickly and efficiently companies are expected to hit them.

*Note: For Gross Margin, the line is very close to 0% throughout and is negligible.*

We hypothesize the decline in correlations in Q2'25 is likely due to market environment changes rather than company fundamentals, with valuation multiples likely more impacted by macro risk factors (e.g. interest rates, geopolitical uncertainty, etc.) and narrative shifts in investor focus (i.e. AI-driven TAM)

## Slide 36: Many AI companies are generally shifting success measurement from feature usage to adoption, engagement, and measurable ROI

**ICONIQ**

**Many AI companies are generally shifting success measurement from feature usage to adoption, engagement, and measurable ROI**

**Example Metrics Tracked at AI-Native and AI-Enabled Companies**

### Adoption
We believe AI product adoption is a leading indicator of market fit and product stickiness. Strong adoption signals early interest and perceived value in the product.
**Example Metrics:**
*   Active user counts
*   Net new ARR
*   Paid pilot ARR
*   Self-serve ARR
*   Free POC to paid customer conversion

### Engagement
AI product engagement reflects the frequency and depth of product use. High engagement typically suggests that the AI products are integrated into workflows and are prime for retention and expansion.
**Example Metrics:**
*   WAU/MAU ratio
*   Retention curve (e.g., % of 1st day DAUs that retained as WAUs)
*   Power user ratio
*   PR / marketing
*   AI mentions
*   Renewals

### Business Outcomes
AI-related business outcomes are tangible results achieved through integration of AI into workflows. Business outcomes are critical to validate ROI of AI products.
**Example Metrics:**
*   Number of resolutions handled by AI
*   Cost or time savings due to AI products
*   Number of AI agents deployed
*   CSAT

AI-Native companies generally show higher conversion rates within the sales funnel, suggesting that the ROI on their products are more immediately clear and valuable to customers. This allows them to convert interest into revenue more efficiently – an even greater advantage in times of macroeconomic uncertainty.

Forward-deployed engineers can be a powerful lever for services-led growth at AI-native and AI-enabled companies to drive product market fit and revenue acceleration. At AI-native companies, FDEs typically sit within the R&D function and embed directly with customers to rapidly iterate on products based on real-time feedback, helping shorten time to value. AI-enabled companies often require deeper integration and technical support across complex workflows where FDEs play a more implementation-driven role and may align more closely with revenue goals.

In an environment where balancing growth and profitability is increasingly important, FDEs must be hired selectively and deployed strategically. Given their high cost, companies should aim to realize at least a 5–10x return on this investment through measurable impact on product adoption, expansion, or revenue efficiency.
