What You Should Know:

–   Ritten, a leading AI-powered system of record for behavioral health providers, today announced a $35 million USD Series B funding round led by Five Elms Capital with participation from existing investors Threshold Ventures, 8VC, Bienville Capital, and others.

–   This investment will support Ritten’s expansion across mental health and addiction treatment providers spanning all levels of care.

A Unified Platform Purpose-Built for Behavioral Health Providers

Ritten is a unified behavioral health practice management platform designed specifically for substance use disorder and mental health treatment providers. Purpose-built rather than retrofitted, the platform brings together a robust EHR, integrated CRM, and comprehensive revenue cycle management into a single system of record. By consolidating these traditionally fragmented functions, Ritten helps treatment organizations streamline operations, maintain regulatory compliance, and deliver higher-quality, more coordinated care. Founded in 2020 and headquartered in Philadelphia, the company supports providers across the United States, ranging from single-site clinics to multi-state enterprise treatment groups.

From its inception, Ritten has focused on reducing operational friction in some of healthcare’s most demanding care environments. Behavioral health clinicians and staff manage complex regulatory requirements, high-acuity patient needs, and resource constraints, often across both outpatient and residential settings. Ritten’s AI-enabled platform simplifies the entire patient and clinician journey—from referrals and admissions to scheduling, clinical documentation, compliance, and billing—helping organizations reduce administrative burden, limit staff burnout, and improve operational performance without compromising care quality.

Advancing an AI-First Roadmap With Five Elms Capital

Five Elms Capital’s investment marks a significant milestone in Ritten’s growth trajectory and reinforces confidence in the company’s long-term vision. According to CEO Noah Whitehead, the partnership reflects strong alignment around Ritten’s mission to equip behavioral health providers with next-generation tools that support both clinical excellence and operational resilience. The investment will enable Ritten to accelerate its AI-first roadmap, deepen support for clinicians and administrative teams, and scale solutions tailored to the nuanced needs of behavioral health organizations.

Looking ahead, Ritten plans to expand AI-powered workflows across the platform, with a particular focus on enhancing clinical efficiency and optimizing revenue cycle management. Additional priorities include strengthening customer support infrastructure and expanding enterprise-grade capabilities to serve larger, more complex provider organizations. As demand for behavioral health services continues to rise nationwide, Ritten is positioning itself as a foundational operating system for treatment providers seeking scalable, compliant, and intelligently automated care delivery.
