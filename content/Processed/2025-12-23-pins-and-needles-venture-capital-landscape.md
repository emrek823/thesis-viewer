# [Pins and Needles: Venture Capital Landscape…](https://ontheflyingbridge.wordpress.com/2025/07/07/pins-and-needles-venture-capital-landscape/)

The state of the capital markets is baffling with conflicting signals issued every day. The stock market is ripping, but 1Q25 GDP growth was just revised downward from a -0.2% to -0.5%.

At first glance last week’s unemployment data looked quite strong with 147k new jobs added overall, but disturbingly most of that increase was for state and local jobs as the private sector was particularly weak with only half of the number of jobs added in May. The juxtaposition of the passing of the “Big Beautiful Bill” was notable. Perhaps these data are an indication that states will now need to pick up what the federal government is abandoning. Another flashing yellow – 130k people quit the labor force.

The public equity performance for the trailing twelve months has largely been running in place, certainly given the expectations attached to the incoming Administration. Notably, the Russell 2000 Index has significantly underperformed the other popular equity indices since the start of 2025, down 2.5% when the S&P 500 Index has increased 5.7%, arguably reflecting investor concerns about the greater exposure small to mid-size companies have to the Administration’s policies.

It is estimated that the value of all stocks globally totals $115 trillion. The last two decades has witnessed an extraordinary de-leveraging of Corporate America, goosed along by the surging stock market. Interestingly, the relative level of corporate debt today is at near-historic lows, while the level of federal debt is unprecedented. S&P 500 debt to market capitalization is now near 10%, while federal debt to GDP is converging on 100%, likely made worse by the Big Beautiful Bill. A corner of the market showing explosive growth is private credit worth now over $1.7 trillion and is estimated to grow to be as much as $40 trillion. As a point of comparison, hedge funds currently manage approximately $4.5 trillion, according to a recent survey by Barron’s.

The number of public companies in the U.S. has collapsed to approximately 4,300, down from over 8,000 30 years ago. While the reasons for this are numerous (Sarbanes-Oxley, etc), the net effect is that more capital is increasingly invested in companies that sidestep rigorous SEC scrutiny and oversight. The SEC estimates that there are now over 100k privately managed funds. Into this slipstream has stepped the crypto industry which now totals $3.4 trillion in assets, of which $2.1 trillion is in Bitcoin.

According to the [National Venture Capital Association](http://www.nvca.org), there are nearly 3,400 venture capital firms managing an estimated $1.2 trillion in assets. Private equity funds now control over 12,400 companies as of 1Q25, according to Pitchbook, and are estimated to have $668 billion invested in “tail-end funds” (*i.e.,* older than ten years), according to Treo Asset Management. Unfortunately, Treo goes on to report that one-third of those long-lived assets are worth less than invested capital.

In an era of unprecedented discovery and innovation across every sector of the economy, the global transformation is head-spinning. To illustrate that, Banc of America recently profiled several phenomena: (i) there are 31 satellites right now tracking your exact location; (ii) the amount of food required over the next 40 years will be more than the last 8,000; (iii) given current wireless network speeds, it would take 300 million years to download the entire internet; (iv) enough plastic has been produced to shrink wrap the entire globe; and, (v) and there have been 108 billion people since the dawn of civilization.

This is just a sampling of the potential opportunities, but also the extraordinary challenges we now face. And the pace of change is accelerating which would ordinarily argue for greater oversight with robust guardrails, and yet we are now moving to further deregulate and, in fact, “de-oversight” important sectors of the economy. And it certainly appears that with innovation, population growth surges. The increased population puts additional pressure on the earth’s resources.

**Profound Innovation at an Accelerating Pace**

An obvious and deeply controversial element to population growth is the concomitant migration that is unleashed. The U.S. has gone rail-to-rail on immigration policy and has struggled mightily to find the appropriate balance. As long-held fundamental rights and traditions are being “redefined” (or ignored all together), there are now real concerns about securing adequate labor across many industries.

The innovation economy (and venture capital industry) is quite dependent on skilled immigrant founders and employees who are both technical (*i.e.,* best and brightest from around the world) and entrepreneurial. Obviously, the fear of arrest, fewer visas being issued, and deportations has generated an outflow of “unauthorized” migrants from the country.

Perhaps in response to these developments, according to [Pitchbook’s “First Look” report](https://pitchbook.com/news/reports/q2-2025-global-vc-first-look?utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=daily_pitch&utm_campaign=vc_market_update&utm_content=q2_2025_global_vc_first_look&utm_term=&sourceType=NEWSLETTER) the venture capital investment activity in 2Q25 showed a marked slowdown in both dollars invested and number of deals with $69.9 billion and 3,038, respectively, when compared to 1Q25 activity of $92.9 billion and 3,622 deals. The Venture Growth stage had the largest decline from $53.2 billion invested in 1Q25 to $30.7 billion in 2Q25. In general, quarterly deal count has continued its descent since the highwater mark of mid-2021, while the capital invested has continued its climb back to mid-2021 levels, driven in large measure by “mega” AI financings.

The bar to raise successful follow-on rounds appears to have been set higher. A [study by Carta](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/peterjameswalker_seed-to-series-a-graduation-rate-activity-7292256120423755777-bu8o/?utm_source=newsletter-vcj-friday-letter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=vcj-friday-letter-registrant&utm_content=30-05-2025) of over 11k seeded companies between 2017 – 2023 showed that only 17% of them were able to raise a proper Series A within two years of initial funding. This historically has ranged between 30% – 35%. This may, in part, be explained by the fact that median Seed round sizes have increased from $1.5 million in 2017 to $2.8 million in 2023, and this year is running at $3.6 million. Over that same period, the median size of Series A financings nearly doubled from $5.1 million to $10.0 million.

The increase in round sizes is also reflected in the significant increase in pre-money valuations across every round. A comparison of 2019 and year-to-date 2025 data (pre- versus post-Covid) is quite revealing. Median pre-money valuations for Seed and Series A financings in 2019 were $6.6 million and $15.5 million, and $20.0 million and $45.5 million in 2025, respectively. Valuations for Venture Growth rounds increased from $350. 0 million to $900.0 million over that same period.

A straight line can be drawn from this phenomenon and the explosion of AI deals. Of the $69.9 billion invested in 2Q25, $40.5 billion was invested in AI companies, representing 58% of the amount invested yet only 35% of the deals announced. In 2019, pre-Covid, those amounts were 22% and 19%, respectively. In 2Q25 the average round size for an AI investment was $38 million as compared to $15 million for all other deals.

Should we be concerned? Perhaps. Notwithstanding that capital concentration is rarely a good thing (too much, too fast), according to a recent [IBM survey of global CEOs](https://fortune.com/article/ceos-ai-initiatves-fraction-deliver-return-on-investment-roi-study/?utm_source=email&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=ceo-daily&utm_content=20250513&tpcc=NL_Marketing), only 25% determined that recent AI investments (products created by all these start-ups) have hit expected ROI thresholds. And yet, 85% of those same CEOs still expect a positive ROI by 2027 through cost-cutting and something called “AI efficiencies.”

Another disconnect: a late 2024 Gallup poll revealed that only 15% of U.S. employees feel that their employer has stated a clear AI strategy.  Notwithstanding that McKinsey research concluded that 88% of enterprises are “undertaking an AI transformation,” only 5% reported having successfully transformed a single business domain.

Liquidity can cover many mistakes. Exit activity in 2Q25 was an encouraging $67.7 billion across 319 transactions, according to Pitchbook. This compared quite favorably to $52.4 billion and 330 transactions, and $38.6 billion and 301 transactions, in 1Q25 and 2Q24, respectively.

The Achilles’ heel to the venture capital model recently has been the abysmal lack of distributions. [According to Carta](https://carta.com/data/vc-fund-performance-q1-2025-full-report/?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosprorata&stream=top), only 30% of all 2020 vintage year venture capital funds have ANY distributions (70% have yet to distribute a penny by year five). A measly 54% of 2018 funds, which are now seven plus years old, have made a distribution, while 19% of the 2017 funds have yet to do so. Carta calculates that the 2017 vintage year funds have a median IRR of 11.5% as of 1Q25 with a total TVPI (total value to paid-in capital) of 1.72x, yet a DPI (distributed to paid-in capital) of 0.27x, underscoring the extreme level of unrealized gains sitting at many venture capital funds.

Venture capital investment certainly is a long game. According to an analysis by Silicon Valley Bank, top quartile funds tend to return total committed capital by Year 10 and will likely require an additional five to ten years for the fund to be fully distributed. Obviously, those timelines can be influenced profoundly by moments of investor euphoria or despair.

A legitimate concern among limited partners is that after the ten-year mark, remaining assets may be liquidated at significant discounts given pressure to wind up the funds as investment managers look to raise a successor fund. A recent study by [Institutional Investor reported](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/venture-capitals-woes-could-get-worse) that there is now more than $3 trillion of unrealized value tied up in venture-backed “unicorns.”  Several recent venture-backed IPOs were priced below the last private round valuation, suggesting that not all the unrealized gains will be captured at the current carrying values.

There is a glimmer of hope for long-standing employees of some of these mature venture-backed companies. With the increased sophistication of the secondary markets, some of these companies are considering tender offers for employees, acknowledging that the average pre-IPO journey is now 12 years. According to a recent Morgan Stanley survey of 150 companies, nearly 40% expected that the next liquidity event would be a private tender offer versus an IPO.

In 2Q25 there were 151 venture capital funds raised totaling $16.6 billion (average fund size $110 million). This was a notable improvement over 1Q25 when 87 funds totaling $10.0 billion were raised. The highwater mark for fundraising was in 2022 when 1,737 funds raised $198.0 billion. Obviously, raising new funds is largely a function of both relative and absolute performance, but also that limited partners expect predictable liquidity from earlier funds. The “false flag” signal in 2022 when venture capital funds distributed nearly one-third of net asset value clearly spurred on significant new fund formation, cheered on by rabid AI enthusiasts.

There are two other developments worth watching when it comes to fundraising:
