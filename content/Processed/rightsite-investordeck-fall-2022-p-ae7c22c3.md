## Slide 2: The Problem

**RIGHT SITE**

+ THE PROBLEM

130 million people visit the ER each year.¹
Over 50% of these visits are not emergencies and are avoidable.²

**H**
$3,400 is the average cost of an avoidable ER visit² — 8x higher than urgent care or PCPs.

**[Ambulance Icon]**
EMS is reimbursed only when transporting patients to an ER, whether or not they have an emergency. EMS also averages long response times for true emergencies because of staffing shortages and hours-long hospital unloading times for low-acuity patients.

**[Exclamation Mark Icon]**
Patients receiving non-emergency care from ERs experience long wait times, surprise bills, and unnecessary services.

## Slide 4: The Market

**RIGHT SITE**

+ THE MARKET

66,000,000 avoidable ER visits.

### All ER Visits³

| Category               | Percentage |
| :--------------------- | :--------- |
| Avoidable ER Visits    | 51%        |
| Needed ER Visits       | 49%        |

### Breakdown of Avoidable ER Visits

| Sub-Category                  | Percentage |
| :---------------------------- | :--------- |
| Avoidable discharge from ER   | 71%        |
| Avoidable in-patient admission| 20%        |
| Avoidable observation stay    | 9%         |

Much of this ER volume is driven by non-emergency conditions such as:
*   epidemic levels of social determinants of health
*   chronic disease
*   the increasing difficulty accessing primary care
*   society conditioned to "call 911 if this is an emergency"

## Slide 5: The Opportunity

**RIGHT SITE**

+ THE OPPORTUNITY

That's 66 million avoidable ER visits with an average savings of $3,000.
The total opportunity is $198 billion.

**Cost Comparison**

| Item                                    | Cost      |
| :-------------------------------------- | :-------- |
| Average cost for avoidable ER visit⁴    | $3,400    |
| Average cost for non-ER care (RightSite solution)⁵ | $400      |
| **Average savings**                     | **$3,000**|

[4] Based on non-emergency ER visits weighted average cost of discharge, observation stay and inpatient dispositions using 2019 Medicare data.
[5] $400 = $150 ER MD telehealth + $50 round trip transportation + $200 RightSite admin fee. RightSite gainshare fees not included.

## Slide 7: Our Services

**RIGHT SITE**

+ OUR SERVICES

The RightSite Connect™ Platform serves any ER-bound non-emergency patient.

**[Ambulance Icon]**
**EMS-INITIATED SERVICE**
Upon arriving at a 911 call, EMS partners with RightSite by activating the RightSite Connect platform on their smartphone or any internet-enabled device. EMS and their patient then connect by video to an ER physician and a RightSite Navigator to confirm the non-emergency condition. The Navigator schedules an appropriate in-network non-emergency provider at a clinic or in the patient's home (virtual or in-person), and arranges on-demand round trip transportation if necessary. RightSite follows up with patients 24 hours later, often uncovering and solving additional needs that help these patients avoid a future trip to the ER.

**[Person with Warning Sign Icon]**
**PROACTIVE OUTREACH SERVICE**
Many ER patients use the ER for non-emergency medical and social needs. For these patients, RightSite's Navigators, trained in empathic communication, offer them personalized navigation to appropriate in-network local clinical and social need resources.
