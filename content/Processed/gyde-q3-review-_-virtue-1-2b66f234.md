## Slide 1: Gyde Q3 Board Meeting

The first AI-native
insurance, wealth,
and health brokerage.

October 2025 | Gyde Q3 Board Meeting
*Gyde

## Slide 2: Executive Summary

### Core Goals for 2H 2025
1. Assemble a World Class Team
2. Drive automation with the Gyde Platform
3. Build a high velocity M&A Machine

### What's Going Well
* We are seeing M&A pipeline movement and have a path to multiple LOIs by EOY
* Our product vision and Renewal Application product is resonating in the market and we are on path to launch both SMS and Voice-based solutions this AEP / OEP
* The team we've assembled is market-leading, and is frequently cited by prospects as a key reason they'll sell to us

### Challenges or Opportunities for Improvement
* Top of the funnel is a challenge and will require significant volumes of tactics in advance of Gyde closing and publicizing its first few deals
* We continue to search for a CTO, which we acknowledge is key leadership gap, but we want to be exceptionally intentional on landing the right profile
* As an AI communication modality, voice is materially more challenging than SMS or chat, and we've recently added team members to accelerate our voice product development efforts (e.g. Michael Lee)

*   **Campaign goals:**
    *   **Goal 1: Client verification auth**

    *   **Goal 2: Enrollment reminder**
        *   Inform the client about upcoming Medicare enrollment deadlines and the importance of reviewing their coverage options. Explain what happens if they miss enrollment periods and help them understand their current plan status.
    *   **Offer to meet:**
        *   Medicare client preferred communication appointment contact.

**Transcript (9/14/2025):**
**Agent:** Hi Ethan! I'm an AI assistant for Michael Brown from PHS Insurance. Medicare enrollment season is approaching! I want to help you review your coverage options and make sure you have the best plan for your needs. How are you doing today?
**Ethan Wilson:** Hi there! I am doing good
**Agent:** That's great to hear, Ethan! I'm glad you're doing well. Before we dive into your Medicare renewal details, I need to verify your identity for security purposes. Could you please confirm your date of birth? This helps me make sure I'm working with the right account.
**Ethan Wilson:** dob is 10/07/1969
**Agent:** Perfect! Thank you, Ethan. Your identity has been verified successfully. Now that we've got that sorted, let me share...

## Slide 15: M&A | Q3 Pipeline Review

### Key Wins & What's Resonating
*   **AI Platform Excitement**
    The market is excited about the impact AI could have on their business, and recognizes us as the future market leader.
*   **Model Differentiation & Deal Making**
    Our AI-driven model and team are universally cited as unique. Nobody is going to market the way we are, and we are confident in our ability to structure deals that balance owner's needs with Gyde's strategy.
*   **Pipeline Velocity**
    We've driven pipeline velocity within our target segment, without any brand awareness or PR, and have a materially larger pipeline built for 2026.

### Challenges & Opportunities
*   **M&A Cycle Timeline**
    The most fertile M&A ground is 1/15-9/15, and we didn't have the runway to take advantage of the full cycle.
*   **Owner Readiness and Education**
    We've targeted a younger, hungrier owner profile, which has been more reluctant to sell. We are oftentimes pulling them to Gyde, and many still have limited experience with structuring and executing deals.
*   **Brand Awareness & Enablement Artifacts**
    Until the very tail end of the sales cycle, we did not have a product to demo and still do not have a website or collateral to legitimize the business.

## Slide 16: M&A Pipeline | Pipeline Performance Snapshot

Represents the total qualified deals that made it to each pipeline stage this year.

|                      | Total Deals | Stage Conversion | Avg. Duration (Days) | Total Revenue |
| :------------------- | :---------- | :--------------- | :------------------- | :------------ |
| Meeting Set          | 42          | 55%              | 8                    | $173.0M       |
| Discovery Complete   | 23          | 35%              | 8                    | $138.7M       |
| Demo Complete        | 8           | 88%              | 16                   | $87.6M        |
| Finance Review Complete | 7           | 57%              | 21                   | $84.6M        |
| Onsite Complete      | 4           | 25%              | 11                   | $6.9M         |
| LOI Sent             | 1           | 25%              | 30                   | $1.8M         |
| Signed               | 0           | 0%               | N/A                  | N/A           |

### Commentary & learnings
*   We are likely performing about as expected assuming Capstone moves to LOI (anecdotally, brokerage LOI conversion rate is 3-5%), but need to drive much more top of the funnel action
*   Agency revenue and timing have been the largest drivers of unqualified deals, leading to a ~75% qualification rate
*   Of the two deals we lost, we likely mispriced one of them and had some owner profile misalignment, and the other was young (30) and felt he needed to put another five hard years in before selling.

### Assumptions & Commentary
*   **Expense Mix:** ~75% of OpEx is headcount-driven, with ~15% allocated to M&A fees and ~10% to general overhead.
*   **Headcount Ramp:** Team grows from 10 to 33 by end of 2026, focused on Tech and M&A to support platform build and acquisition integration
*   **Profitability Timing:** Operating losses expected through 2027; breakeven and positive operating profit projected in 2028 as scale and margin expand
*   **Capital Alignment:** Budget assumes execution of 4-6 acquisitions in 2026 and continued traction in AI platform development
*   **Execution Focus:** Spend is calibrated to build foundational capabilities – engineering, integration, and deal velocity – while maintaining discipline on burn and hiring pace

### Key Assumptions
*   **Deal Velocity:** Execute 1-2 in 2025, 4-6 deals in 2026, and 1 incremental deal per quarter in the subsequent years through 2030.
*   **Annual Growth:** Gyde assets grow at 20-25% annually (2-2.5x market).
*   **Margin Expansion:** Margin grows to 40% over a four to five year transformation.
*   **Multiple Arbitrage:** Achieve a 2x multiple arbitrage. Currently, this means acquiring assets for a blended multiple of 10x EBITDA or 2.5x revenue, and trade at 20x EBITDA ($AJG at 23x) or 5x revenue.
*   **Product Launch Timing:** Wealth Management and Clinical Data & Engagement launch in years 2028 and 2029 respectively.
*   **Modest Leverage:** Leverage of 5-30% is used based on margin profile and size of the assets at time of acquisition.

## Slide 28: Budget & Capital Needs Scenarios

### Capital Needs: Why Now & Needs (one page overview)

*   **AI Application Development**
    All market signals reinforce that we have an opportunity to lead and we want to bring on more engineering talent faster to accelerate our development efforts.
*   **M&A Sales Cycle Readiness**
    1/15-9/15 is the most fertile M&A ground, and we need to be capitalized in advance of this, particularly given our funnel. Raising during Q1 will take players off the field during the most critical M&A window.
*   **Market Disruption**
    We think this Q4 will be a difficult cycle for many assets, and Q1 may represent the best time in the last half decade to tackle these segments aggressively.
*   **Market Competition**
    The improving interest rate environment will activate those who were sitting more idle the past year, and we will need to move faster and more efficiently than these peers.
*   **Capital Needs**
    To execute our motion, we recommend a raise of $50M in 2026, followed by another raise in ~12 months. As a part of this, we would recommend collectively acknowledging that we may require more capital if / when we want to make a larger transaction opportunistically.
*   **Fundraise Timing**
    Kick off in late October to allow a roughly four week process leading into Thanksgiving, with follow on fund meetings occurring between Thanksgiving and Christmas.

## Slide 29: M&A Strategy

We're offering a growth catalyst, not an exit

Gyde Partners are owners who want to accelerate their growth, while continuing to run their agencies.

We offer a path to breaking through the operating constraints that cap agency growth at 10%.

**Chart Data (Annual Growth %):**
*   Market Baseline: 10%
*   Core LOB (Gyde platform): >10% (increase from baseline)
*   Cross Sell (Gyde platform): Additional increase
*   Agent Contracting (Gyde value creation): Additional increase
*   Contract Renegotiation (Gyde value creation): Additional increase
*   Gyde Agency Annual Growth: Significant increase, >20% possibly up to 30% or more.

The chart depicts a waterfall effect where each element (Core LOB, Cross Sell, Agent Contracting, Contract Renegotiation) contributes to increasing annual growth, ultimately breaking the typical 10% market baseline and pushing Gyde Agency Annual Growth significantly higher.
