## Slide 4: Decline In Independent Physicians = Decline in Quality of Care

Decline In Independent Physicians = Decline in Quality of Care

Quality of patient care is rapidly declining across the country, due to the
decline in independent physicians who lack the business and technological
infrastructure to sustainably run their practice and remain independent.

Financial pressures by profit-led organizations leads to over-
treatment or under-treatment.

*   Standardized care protocols does not always consider individual patient needs.
*   Limited time for patient interaction hinders effective communication and shared decision-making.
*   Pressure to adhere to reimbursement guidelines influences treatment and diagnostic accuracy.

## Slide 11: Approaching the Market From Both Sides

Approaching the Market
From Both Sides

**Risk Bearing Entities**
Through collaborations with risk-bearing
entities, we form strong partnerships with
health insurers, managed care organizations,
and physicians' organizations. These
partnerships enable us to provide seamless
services to independent providers,
enhancing their existing contracts and
delivering added value to their customers.

**Independent Providers**
By targeting billing companies, we integrate
our services as a valuable addition to their
existing offerings, thereby enhancing the
services received by their customers. This
approach also allows us to leverage their
existing contracts, reducing our sales cycles
and streamlining the onboarding process of
our newly offered services.

## Slide 21: Quality Measures (HEDIS) and Risk Adjustment (RA)

Quality Measures (HEDIS) and Risk Adjustment (RA)
Why It Matters

CMS' Quality Measures and Risk Adjustment incentives are the
primary monetary drivers for value-based healthcare, rewarding
physicians for improving care quality and adjusting payments based
on health status and needs of individual patients. Success in these
initiatives ensures financial stability for their organization.

## Slide 22: It's Hard for Physicians to Effectively Close Gaps Quality & Risk Adjust

It's Hard for Physicians to Effectively
Close Gaps Quality & Risk Adjust

In order to effectively close quality gaps and perform risk adjustment within a
practice, physicians must take on significant operational burden using
reimbursements from inconsistent payment cycles, including:

*   Managing patient gap lists across contracted health plans to
    perform certain types of visits (e.g. scheduling AWVs, referring to
    appropriate specialists, chasing charts from referrals).
*   Appropriately documenting visits for diagnosis and procedures &
    managing the claims submission process.
*   Reconciling irregular & obscure payments over long pay cycles (i.e.
    RA payments can take up to 18 months to get to the provider).

## Slide 23: Why We Are Working on Jubilee

Why We Are Working on Jubilee

**ApolloMed**
The QCO department is essentially a VBC primary care clinic. Their QCO programs are divided
into key Quality measures, each of which require significant operational burden to perform
successfully. By working with this team, we get first-hand experience on what it takes for a
practice to run a successful Quality operation. The RA department is responsible for ensuring
their independent providers are submitting the right data and improving their RAF scores.
Working with them allows us to understand what health plans and MSO/IPAs need from the
provider. Though one degree removed, knowing the expectations of the provider's main
stakeholders gives us context on what a successful RA practice operation needs to deliver.

**Clever Care Health Plan (CCHP)**
Our proof of concept project with CCHP is another avenue through which we can learn, ideate,
and test our hypotheses on what infrastructure we need to build for an independent physician
to run a successful value-based practice. The primary goal is to validate a set of tech-enabled
services by working directly with pilot providers. Achieving this goal will clarify our direct-to-
provider value proposition and make way for a GTM strategy.

## Slide 24: Company Future-State

Company Future-State

**2023**
Our 2023 goal is to define and operationalize a validated set of provider-focused
tech-enabled services through these customers and projects. We are aiming to
launch these services for at least 1-3 providers in Southern California.

**2024**
Our 2024 goal is to scale our services to more independent physician practices
across Southern California, iterating on our technology and operations to
achieve product-market fit. We are aiming to be able to scale these services for
at least 3-10 providers in Southern California.

## Slide 28: Annual Wellness Visit

Annual Wellness Visit
A health evaluation (not a physical examination) is intended to reconcile a member's recent health events and create
or update a personalized prevention plan to help members stay healthy.

*   **Health Evaluation**
    Personal health, family health, social history, depression screening,
    physician assessment, functional assessment, preventative
    screenings and other health concerns specified by patient.

*   **Post Visit Work**
    **Document Collection:** Clinicians may need to compare patient
    reports with specialists' notes, hospital records, or lab/imaging results.
    **Follow-up Tasks:** The clinician will request authorizations for various
    specialties and order screenings, prescriptions, and lab work.
    **Coding and Billing:** The Annual Wellness Visit (AWV) team extracts or
    confirms diagnosis and procedure codes for billing.

## Slide 31: Risk Adjustment Process

Risk Adjustment Process
Incorrect coding affects RA performance and payments. We aim to understand the health plan and MSO/IPA perspective
on coding, physician education, and strategies to ensure accurate documentation and claims coding.

*   **Concurrent Risk Adjustment**
    An audit of a chart immediately after encounter completion and
    before a claim is generated and submitted to the payer.

*   **Prospective Risk Adjustment**
    An audit of charts for "open-gap" patients, after the visit has been
    documented and the claim has been submitted to the payer.

*   **Retrospective Risk Adjustment**
    An audit of the prior year's Primary Care Provider charts for all eligible
    members under the physician, regardless of gap status.
