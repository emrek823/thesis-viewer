### Sagar’s Background

- Former DoorDash operator (Jan '18 - Mar '24)
	- White-labeled business division (logistics for other apps)
	- Chipotle app orders → DoorDash picks up and delivers
	- Scaled from $15-18M (first year) to north of $1B (2023)
	- Contribution margin: -$5-10M to +$75M
	- Grew from IC to managing 50 people
	- Employee ~400 → company at 15K when left
- Recent stint at Traba (Feb - Jul 2025)
	- Joined through COO connection from DoorDash
	- Owned new product line and strategy/ops teams
	- Left after 5-6 months
- Pre-DoorDash: banking, private equity, entrepreneurial attempts

### Healthcare Market Entry Concerns

- Lacks direct healthcare experience
	- Worried about adding value to industry
	- Uncertain if operators need healthcare backgrounds
- Emre’s perspective on non-healthcare talent:
	- Often more valuable for operational roles
	- Fresh perspective on inefficient processes
	- Example: ZoomLogic needs logistics expertise over molecule knowledge
- Founder-market fit varies by use case
	- Some require domain expertise (insurance underwriting)
	- Others benefit from outside perspective (logistics, operations)

### VirtueVC Investment Approach

- First institutional check preference (~90% of portfolio)
- Precede and seed stage focus
- Target ~10% ownership, up to $2M checks
- Sub-$20M valuation range typically
- Purposefully sourcing non-healthcare founders
	- Belief in untapped talent outside healthcare
	- Healthcare’s late technology adoption creates opportunities

### Rapid Medical Connection

- Company Sagar previously spoke with
- Medical supply logistics between hospital systems
- Left on good terms, willing to introduce
- Potential partnership with ZoomLogic
	- ZoomLogic: manufacturing to warehouse
	- Rapid Medical: warehouse to market
- Example of supply chain collaboration opportunities

### Next Steps

- Sagar to introduce Emre to Rapid Medical team
- Continued dialogue on healthcare logistics opportunities
- Focus on operational roles rather than heavy science positions
- Stay connected as Sagar explores healthcare sector
