# Abridge - Chief Medical Informatics Officer, VP & AI/RCM/CDI Physician Executive at LifePoint Health

Interview conducted on June 14, 2023

## Topics
Primary Care, Specialty Care, Automation, Verbal Ordering, Dictation Systems, EHRs, Patient-Centric Care, AI Accuracy

## Summary
The Chief Medical Informatics Officer at LifePoint Health discusses their use of Abridge and DAX with the Tegus Client. They explain that Abridge is more suitable for primary care doctors, while DAX is better for specialists. Abridge was chosen for its automation, cost-effectiveness, patient-centric approach, and EHR integration. The officer mentions the benefits of DAX, including instant note creation and improved efficiency for specialists. They highlight the importance of provider satisfaction and recruitment. Abridge is currently cheaper and compatible with Epic, while DAX works with every EHR. Abridge is still in the early stages of implementation, but around 2/3 of their primary care doctors could use it. The officer discusses the potential benefits of Abridge for coding and documentation. They emphasize the importance of options and competition in the market. Abridge is highly accurate with a dataset of 1.5 million, but its accuracy may improve with more data. Doctors have to make a slight change in how they describe things when using Abridge, but it is not a dissatisfier. The expert rates Abridge a seven and a half out of ten.

**Client**
Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today about Abridge. My understanding is, you are currently Chief Medical Informatics Officer at LifePoint Health? And what was your previous workflow was or what you were using before you started using Abridge?

**Expert**
Yes. It was a combination of dictation; actual scribes and no other solutions were in place.

**Client**
Right. So, you guys had actual scribes and then some of it was just manual, the physician or clinician actually did their own notes?

**Expert**
And/or with dictation systems like Dragon or M Modal. Just essentially a dictation like transcription. More or less, there are templates there or things like that, but it is glorified transcription.

**Client**
Okay. And how did you hear about Abridge? What was kind of the process of getting on Abridge?

**Expert**
We were already customers of DAX and were looking at some other solutions because DAX is may be more of a specialty play. And Abridge came to light at a trade show and then some kind of professional kind of connectivity of this solution kind of came to light. Could this be a potential solution for our primary care docs, given that DAX is more of a specialty opportunity for our use?

**Client**
All right. And then did you run a formal RFP process? Or did you evaluate any competitors to Abridge?

**Expert**
We've evaluated the whole gamut. We've demoed Suki. We've understood a DeepScribe. Some of the other kind of smaller bit players in the market. We've kind of looked at iScribe. I think to me, it's just as we really understood our markets, our EHRs and thought Abridge would be a nice complement to DAX, given our road map and given where we're looking for some solutions in the primary care space as well as what DAX is doing in the specialty care space.

**Client**
Okay. Can we dig in a little bit on how did you evaluate all of these different tools? And then what were kind of the differences you saw? And what made Abridge really stand out?

**Expert**
Sure. Clearly, which one has the leading kind of automation behind it? Which vendor takes the manual process completely out of the thing? And I think that to me is the biggest differentiator with Abridge. There is no manual process. Everything is fully automated. And as you think about the market space in general, that's really where the trend is going.

Remove the middleman and actually have an execution keeps the cost well in check as well as a consistent product that not only is patient-centric because the product ends up on the patient side, but also provider-centric as well.

**Client**
Okay. You said you value DeepScribe. There was kind of a person in the loop, same in the Suki and iScribe. Did you guys look at or have heard of Ambient?

**Expert**
I have a demo with them in two weeks from now. What I would tell you with them thus far is that it's very lean on EHR solutions. And I think with the maturity of our EHR stack and where our markets are, it's hard for us to be those developers in some of the spaces. We prefer the more finished product and I think that's way too early in its infancy.

I think everybody is getting caught up in what AI can do, but I would tell you DAX and Abridge do it way better now. And to me, they're already proven, it's how I view Ambient. So again, encouraged by at least understanding what their rationale and differentiator may be.

**Client**
Okay. If I'm understanding correctly, it seems like Abridge, all the start-up players that you have evaluated is the best balance of essentially kind of commercial usability where has integrations and also quality in terms of automation. Is that fair?

**Expert**
Absolutely. And I'd add two other ones to it. I'd add from a cost perspective, it is really cost savvy. And number two, very few products in the market now have a patient end of it, whereas the Abridge started with the patient side and then extended to the provider. Nobody else can tell that story and I think that's a good one for them as we think more about patient-centric care.

**Client**
Okay. And then with Ambient, it sounds like you're going to have the demo, but from the kind of impression here so far, it seems really differentiated or the automation seems superior possibly, but it's pretty early in terms of EHR integrations and just other capabilities?

**Expert**
Correct. And I think in this spot, what's already available and how much data do we have to lean on and what our AI is going to look like. The thing that I most appreciate about DAX is they've got tens of millions of data points that makes their AI very robust and strong. And it integrates into every EHR. To me, those are huge differentiators that most other competitors cannot ever get to or kind of level up with.

**Client**
All right. And then with DAX, as you mentioned that you're going to use Abridge kind of for primary care, but you're using specialty care for DAX. Could you talk a little bit more about the differences between Abridge and DAX? And how you're using them?

**Expert**
Sure. I think from a price point of DAX, oftentimes what you end up seeing is, this is really the play of those providers that are really not technology savvy, but yet are in a specialty that commands more patient volume and more complexity in their documentation. To me, that is where DAX really hits the mark in that let's have the providers that have the app on their phone, walk in, have the conversation, notes created instantaneously.

It really mitigates the potentials of delays and notes, really helps capture the full picture of what that actual clinical encounter was about. And to me, it really rings true about specialists' kind of leveraging, this frees up a lot of their time and encourages more patient visits, actually billing at a higher level of complexity.

Because the tool is actually picking up those conversations and placing it into a soap note that's more kind of complete than what that provider who would have that encounter. Write up that note or dictate, we're going to miss something there. To me, these are big satisfiers of why it works so well for our specialists to increase volume, better complexity of notes as well as mitigate any type of audit trail because the providers are now signing your notes much timelier.

**Client**
And with DAX, is it also fully automated where there's no turnaround time?

**Expert**
They have that coming. That's in the end of quarter two, you should expect to have DAX Express which will take the middleman out of it entirely at a lower price point. Whereas right now, what we're leveraging is you kind of have that learning curve. Give the system, give that manual piece, the ability to kind of tailor the AI so that by Note 300, you're able to get all those notes instantaneously.

But if you start at day one to refine that AI to be at like a 99.9% accuracy, you need to let it learn yourself. I will tell you off the shelf, it's about a 95% accuracy if you leverage the produced Note instantaneously, but for some of those unique words that some of the specialties have to fine-tune it, you need a little bit of a ramp to get to that expressed version.

**Client**
Okay. So right now, it's kind of a 95% accuracy anywhere out there is a middle man, so does it take a few hours?

**Expert**
That's 90 minutes.

**Client**
All right. And in terms of just priorities overall, between cost, automation and saving time, what were the priorities where you ultimately decide on DAX for some of these specialists and Abridge for your primary care physicians?

**Expert**
Sure. A lot of it went to provider retainment or recruitment to try to stay competitive with providers who have been asking for this type of technology. Those two rationales were things that we got to start thinking about. The other piece of this is there a tool that really is much my kind of provider savvy where it just kind of takes the provider of having to get too involved, I would say that's where DAX really is strong.

I would also tell you the road map of where DAX is going when it comes to actual verbal ordering, "Hey, I want to order a CBC, I want to order a CMP” to actually be able to embed those orders into actually being executed to me is a big satisfier. I've built up early adopters of just the documentation, be able to tell the provider that, on the pipeline is verbal ordering, is some clinical decision support that's being built in.

These are big satisfiers for providers to jump on board. And then when this comes in, what does it do? It's taking them away from looking at a screen and actually being able to provide better care and/or at least more volume as well.

**Client**
Got it. It sounds like actually number one priority is really about provider of section. And so with that how is DAX more hands-off than Abridge? What does that mean?

**Expert**
I think what we gain is the $8 million to $10 million kind of data points that DAX already has baked into the methodology of the AI. There is more fine-tuning that has to happen with Abridge, and Abridge really is only established for primary care. They've got more time of data that they need to kind of build out the specialties in order for their tools to really be viable in those spaces.

Primary care is a little bit more of a repeatable process that though they don't have as many data points, it's probably a fair starting point to leverage just primary care first. So to me, that's a differentiator. DAX can do it, Abridge can't right now because DAX is more of a mature product versus Abridge.

**Client**
Can you name a few of these specialties because I know Abridge is also used by a few specialties as well. What are the main specialties that you guys are referring to?

**Expert**
Orthopedics, GI, general surgery, those are the top three.

**Client**
Got it. And then I I guess, cost how much is cost to factor? Is it Abridge cheaper than DAX?

**Expert**
Yes. On the surface, yes, because Abridge is inherently a middle person. Inherently, it is cheaper. I think with DAX Express, that pricing will be very equivalent in the near probably within three months, the pricing was very equivalent. And the other differentiator is that Abridge is really only Epic friendly right now, which, again, has its drawbacks if you have other EHRs beyond Epic, whereas DAX is on every EHR.

**Client**
Okay. When you decided that your primary care physicians are going to use Abridge, what was the initial making process there? Like why not just use DAX for everyone?

**Expert**
This really comes down to the ROI, and that's really where DAX is a specialty play, again, higher, but higher value specialties that drive more revenue across the hospital system, whether it's surgeries, lab, diagnostics. Oftentimes, this can be something that is cost neutral and/or a better ROI on the specialist because they're driving revenue across the hospital versus just visit after visit after visit, that's probably more of a primary care approach.

Not sure they drive revenue to other things but getting people into the hospitals to do surgery as a lot of other value behind some of the specialists. That is the primary driver there of why the specialists are kind of focused a little bit more with that.

Whereas of the Abridge, you're talking about the patient side of that. And you think from your primary care space, you think value-based care, documentation transparency, it lends itself to have a little bit more engagement with the patients in the primary care space with Abridge.

**Client**
Okay. What does the Abridge use case look like today? What does the workflow look like for the physicians that you are using it? And how many are using it?

**Expert**
Low volume of numbers yet because we're just really getting started with our first Epic site with the primary care. This is not only going to be a provider satisfier because in theory, we can alleviate that burden of documentation. But ultimately, it's also going to benefit the patients who never go into their patient portal, never review their documentation and have maybe significant questions post visit that they otherwise can't get answered.

Whereas, this ability to have an interactive version of that note with linked to words that might be confusing to them or recordings of that conversation that a caregiver who wasn't available in that visit, these are all things that are very primary care friendly is the way I frame that. So to me, those are the use cases.

And then hopefully, what that does is buys us time for Abridge to continue to improve the product, improve the kind of the data behind it and ultimately get on to more EHRs where it might be a nice complement because not every provider is a DAX provider. Again, with that cost value that comes into play. But it's just because they're not DAX doesn't mean they can't be using some other solution. And that's why we feel like both of these options are very viable in markets together.

**Client**
Got it. How many primary care doctors do you have unlike I think could use Abridge?

**Expert**
Sure. Overall, we have 80 hospitals with probably, 2,500 primary care docs or family practitioners in our market. I would say probably 2/3 of them would be great candidates for such a product. Because your third are always going to be those that or maybe you've already perfected a way to do documentation without it and you don't need to burden them.

Some are going to be retired. There's all reasons why that third never get captured. But you could expect probably 2/3 of the 2,500 to probably be great candidates for this and for something that as we start thinking about more value-based care trends, some of the coding that comes behind it, this is one of those initiatives that I think is only going to continue to spread with use of these types of tools.

**Client**
Is that just because it will help capture some of the codes and reference better?

**Expert**
Yes. And I think really, it tells a better story for the providers overall, especially with the patient end of this being so patient friendly. I think providers are going to want to have more of that interaction with the patient and less having to stare at a screen to do a lot of things. I think it really plays into a provider of knowing that they would love a solution but are just kind of living in the moment of what they have available that this to me would be something that everybody is going to be, "Hey, this makes sense. I like it. It's good technology."

And it basically picks up my conversation, work for work and places in the right portion of a note. To me, that's just an inherent satisfier because it's taking the provider from having to spend a lot of time, post visit, at night or remembering the next day what they did. It eliminates a lot of those variables that are kind of very unprovided friendly.

**Client**
Got it. And then assuming Abridge like DAX better, could you see replacing DAX with the Abridge for also specialties as well? Is there anything inherently about DAX other than currently, the model is a bit better and the service is a bit better for these specialties? Or is it more just, over time, you could see Abridge being used by more specialties?

**Expert**
I would say there's always going to be a space for both. We have a lot of other business with Nuance when it comes to other products that ultimately is a value to us. I would say also, when you think about the real healthy and aggressive road map that DAX brings to the table when you think about verbal ordering, which to me is really going to be a key. We actually putting in coding and E&M codes based upon documentation.

These are all significant satisfiers that the other products that they got to get out of their own way to get going, DAX could begin to already plan some of that content and expectations. To me, these are always going to be things that are going to be big differentiators that puts it as probably always wanting to have both, but never wanting to replace. Because the other products aren't going to deliver that in enough time to say you can start to replace one.

**Client**
All right. Could there be a future where you would just completely replace Abridge with DAX?

**Expert**
Likely not because I think it's always nice to have options. And I think to me, there's always going to be an indication where DAX really isn't on that patient side of things. I always think, you don't want to get saturated with just one vendor when there are multiple reasons why you'd want to give options to providers, but not too many that basically cloud the actual solution that you're looking to accomplish.

**Client**
DAX isn't really patient-facing, how is that sort of capability and they're not working on really building that out? And so that's important. And then also, it's just always having a few products to kind of hedge the availability of products, is that fair?

**Expert**
I think the competition breeds continued improvement. And yes, they're competitors, but Abridge would tell you we're not trying to compete with DAX market. DAX realizes they're not for everybody. And at a certain cost point, you need to think a little bit more fiscally with certain providers who aren't maybe the main drivers of revenue, but they still need a potential solution. I think there's a soft spot for both of them. And I think they both readily admit that.

**Client**
All right. Do physicians get to choose their own? That is the thing that I've heard from many other practices where physicians essentially get a couple of choices and then get to choose or they can kind of almost champion for a new choice if they feel very strongly. Nobody is forcing them to use DAX or Abridge or something else, like tops down. Is that true?

**Expert**
Not forcing. We're going to say, here are the solutions available that you get to pick from, but we're not really opening it up and you want to try that one simply because there's still a maintenance piece of this to continue to optimize and improve these products. And we don't have a robust kind of AI team or dictation team that will be doing a lot of this work to maintain 10 different vendors.

That's really where to me, it's probably a one, two or three option DAX, Abridge, maybe if you're a provider that needs something else. Maybe you're just resistant and you want an actual scribe, those one-off scenarios. But to me, this would not be, hey, you have five solutions available and the provider gets to pick. You're going to need to be more here are the options that we as an organization endorse, which of these would you be interested in? And kind of keep it in line with here's what we can endorse via the organization.

**Client**
Got it. And how big is your organization overall? How typical is that kind of choice matrix to help organizations throughout the U.S.?

**Expert**
I would say we're on the very large size of a hospital chain. And I would tell you that I think most organizations are not going to give many options in these spaces. They're probably looking at one or two. Maybe there's an exception for 1/3 based upon unique service lines, like behavioral health is one of those very unique specialties that nobody really caters to really well right now because of the verbose documentation that they have.

But I mean there might be some one-off scenarios where you might have 1/3 in the market, but you're looking at predominantly a single market or a single entity or maybe potentially two that you can kind of interchange based upon the EHR that you have, but very few more beyond that.

**Client**
And then could you talk a little bit just about the Abridge output? Like anything around error rate or quality that you've observed so far.

**Expert**
Yes, I would say it's off the shelf, highly accurate. What I would say is what makes the differentiator as far as the data that supports the product. If DAX is at about a 10 million data like kind of documentation and data points that they've used to build out their AI, Abridge is probably at 1.5 million.

That's not to say that there's that much more to gain that much product, but it basically eliminates all that doubt as far as variation with that higher volume of data points. So if Abridge is at that 95% overall, DAX may start there, but they get you to that almost at 99%, 99.9% accuracy, which to me right off the shelf, 95% is nice, but I do want to have a system that gets me closer to 100%. I feel like Abridge is kind of at that level. And until there's more data put into the system, it's really going to stay at that 95%, 96% accuracy.

**Client**
All right. In terms of the real-time experience workflow, one thing that we've heard is doctors have to change the way that they talk in order to really accurately capture some of these conversations into Abridge. Is that something that you've noticed with your doctors or just kind of in trials? And does that at all ever keep doctors from adopting?

**Expert**
You read about the change a little bit in the narrative of how you're describing things. Oftentimes, historically, you've done a physical exam, you're not mentioning exactly everything that you're doing in order for it to be picked up. You're just in your head back to your head, you remember it.

So, what we do is we either train accordingly that pay just a little bit of a different cadence that you need to describe or you can still do that same exam that you've always done, walk out of the room, maintain that recording and be able to say, drop in my template for da, da, da or excuse yourself, walk out of the room post visit and be able to add that to a note and then be able to kind of go right back into sync of that note being available instantaneously.

It is a slight change. It isn't a provider dissatisfier. It is just one of those things that a provider needs to get comfortable with to understand their conversation. Sometimes I got to iScribe what I'm doing in order for it to be picked up versus I'm just going to back of my head, go remember when I did.

**Client**
Got it. You haven't noticed so far, any providers kind of walking away from the product being like, okay, this is too difficult or too much of a change in my behavior?

**Expert**
No, we've got a retention rate of about 85%. That's really with just like the product organically taking care of itself. I would expect that number to continue to incrementally rise.

**Client**
Okay. So you're currently seeing a product retention rate of 85%?

**Expert**
Yes. And what that number is based upon is, you see 15 patients a day, over 75% of those patients, you're using the technology for. There's always going to be a scenario where it just doesn't align with the product. But that 75% should be where you try to get to of how many notes are actually being used in the technology.

**Client**
Got it. I think you've already alluded to some of the features that you're really excited about in DAX. Where are the Abridge weaknesses or things thought could be improved?

**Expert**
I think it's just the building of a data robust base to actually get that incremental 95% higher. I would say the road map of actually trying to keep up with what verbal ordering is going to look like very soon. And I would also say we need to expand being able to use the product into multiple spaces successfully beyond just primary care. These aren't knocks or weaknesses. These just observations when you're comparing to a competitor in theory that's been doing this a lot longer.

**Client**
Got it. And if you had to rate Abridge on a scale of one to 10, what would you give out?

**Expert**
I would give it a seven and a half, and that's only because it's only going to get better, whereas I put DAX at a nine. And again, comparatively speaking, they're not far off, it's simply that DAX is more of a mature solution.

**Client**
Got it. That is super helpful. Thank you for taking the time today. Enjoy the rest of your day.
