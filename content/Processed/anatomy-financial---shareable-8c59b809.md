### ...as a result, providers struggle with spreadsheets and legacy point solutions

A diagram illustrates the current fragmented financial management for providers:
A "Provider" (represented by a doctor icon) is at the center.
*   "EMR/billing" feeds into Microsoft Excel.
*   Microsoft Excel is then connected to the "Provider".
*   The "Provider" is separately connected to multiple financial services:
    *   **Bank Accounts**: (BANK OF AMERICA logo)
    *   **Tax & Accounting**: (intuit quickbooks. logo)
    *   **Loans**: (BHG BANKERS HEALTHCARE GROUP logo)

    *   **Cards**: (Capital One logo)
    *   **BNPL**: (CareCredit logo)

**INITIAL MARKET**
*   Target specialities based on number of providers in private practice, higher expenses/inventory needs, working capital constrained, EMR concentration

**INITIAL DISTRIBUTION**

**Customer Quote:**
"...a platform that helps to tie in all financial aspects of a medical practice to help practices manage funds more efficiently, reduce administrative burdens and help identify "potentially problematic scenarios" such as reconciliation, integrations with EMR/PM systems, QuickBooks, credit cards, etc. I'm really excited to see something like this and genuinely feel like practices have a million little burdens to contend with and that any system that can function as 2+ systems in one for efficiency would be a beautiful resource...Once it's developed, it would be a product I'd like to offer our clients to help with getting them off on the right foot."
-Kim, private practice consultant
