*With this funding, Strive Health will further scale its business to bring its innovative care model to more patients and providers.*

Over [35 million](https://www.kidney.org/press-room/nkf-urges-global-recognition-kidney-disease-world-health-assembly) Americans have kidney disease, however [90%](https://www.kidney.org/press-room/nkf-urges-global-recognition-kidney-disease-world-health-assembly) of people are unaware of their underlying condition until it progresses to the point when dialysis or a transplant is necessary. Strive’s value-based care approach to kidney disease emphasizes early intervention and preventative care and has demonstrated the ability to deliver meaningful impacts including a 20% reduction in the total cost of kidney care and a 41% reduction in hospitalizations, while achieving 94% overall patient satisfaction.

With this funding, Strive, and its team of over 700 employees — aka “Strivers” — will strengthen end-to-end strategic partnerships, grow its multi-specialty services and enhance its value-based care model through advanced technology, including AI-driven tools and analytics, as it works to continue delivering tailored kidney care solutions.

“When we founded Strive in 2018, the team set out to transform kidney care,” said Chris Riopelle, Co-Founder and CEO of Strive. “The continued investments from NEA, Strive’s founding capital partner, alongside a syndicate of leading financial institutions combined with valued tech and healthcare strategics, is a clear signal that the Strive team is delivering on that mission. By transforming kidney care, we will ultimately make the healthcare system work better for patients and providers.”

Since its founding, Strive has conducted over 1.3 million patient touchpoints and generated more than $400 million in savings for its health plan and provider partners. Strive currently partners with more than 6,500 providers across all 50 states and manages nearly $5 billion of annual medical spend for over 145,000 people. Over the past few years Strive launched or expanded relationships with [many leading payor, health system and provider partners](https://strivehealth.com/partnership/). Strive’s standard of excellence for its partners and patients is achieved through high-touch, preventative care and AI solutions that generate reductions in total cost of care and improved clinical outcomes.

“We recognize that clinician-led healthcare solutions with meaningful scale are where AI-implementations will have the most impact when it comes to improving outcomes for chronic disease management and preventive care — but those companies also happen to be exceedingly rare,” said Mohamad Makhzoumi, Co-CEO of NEA. “NEA remains a proud supporter of Strive’s mission of deploying its innovative care model to slow the progression of kidney disease and we are excited at the potential for Strive’s impact to grow exponentially with this more than half a billion-dollar capital raise.”
