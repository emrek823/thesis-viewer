# Redono Health

## Redono Health Executive Summary

Redono Health develops voice-first, AI-powered documentation technologies for physical therapists and other ambulatory/outpatient medical professionals. Physical therapists have an increasing documentation burden due to higher patient loads (now an average of 17 patients per day at PT chains) and more stringent insurance expectations. Notes are frequently completed after hours, and 35% of therapists report burn out. It's not surprising that physical therapists are more than twice as likely to leave their jobs compared to other healthcare professionals!

Redono Health is developing a novel in-clinic documentation workflow in which the majority of documentation is completed during patient visits via conversation and unstructured dictation. This documentation workflow is enabled by rapid advancements in AI in the past year; high-quality clinical transcription and structured data parsing are now possible without capital-intensive custom ML models. Redono Health's built-in mobile recording and note review processes will ensure voice-first documentation creates significant time savings for providers.

### Competition

Most physical therapy clinics currently use PT-specific EMR solutions from market leaders such as WebPT, Raintree, and Net Health. They are also beginning to utilize remote therapeutic monitoring software, such as Medbridge and Limber Health, to generate billable codes to prescribe and monitor home exercise programs. Redono Health will partner with existing PT software providers through an open API and partnerships to ensure all clinics can benefit from high-quality voice-first documentation without having to switch from sticky incumbent platforms.

There are several companies focusing on conversational documentation tools for physicians such as Augmedix, Abridge, and Nabla, however the features and workflows for PTs and allied medical professionals are differentiated enough that they will necessitate entirely different workflows.

### Market Sizing

Physical Therapy is a large $45B market, with 230,000 practicing physical therapists in the US. The current market size of physical therapy software is $1.2B and the larger ambulatory EMR market size is $6.5B. The opportunity cost of documentation time, however, is much larger than PT EMR revenues. PTs bill insurance at approximately $120/hour and spend at least one hour per day on their documentation. A full elimination of after-visit documentation time would unlock roughly $7B/year in additional productivity. Given that the PT industry is growing at a >5% CAGR (due to an aging population and a shift towards value-based care), more PT practices will operate at capacity and look to increase patient loads.
