ANNA Go-to-Market Detail

ANNA Go-to-Market Detail

# Executive Summary

ANNA began by proving out a strong foundation across 5 foundational pillars: 1) Consistent referral generation, 2) Repeatable recruiting engine, 3) Consistent clinical excellence, 4) Strong P&L margin profile, and 5) Exponential unit economic efficiency.

After demonstrating each of these five capabilities with the first center, we leaned heavily into multi-site expansion, with four locations open today, each outpacing the last in trajectory and trending toward broad market density amounting to PF ~$40 million in top-line revenue and ~$13 million in consolidated cash flow across just those 8 locations–with extensive opportunity to build more in each sub-market.

With the multi-site trajectory proving out strong demand, we are leaning heavily into market expansion, targeting five new markets–Washington is fully licensed and contracted in our MSO model with an opportunity for center-based operations, Arizona & Indiana are already licensed and actively contracting and Minnesota & Missouri are in process via accelerated M&A opportunities. Each of these markets is expected to go live in 2026 through a GM-led growth model.

The investments into AI have further accelerated this trajectory, as our market-leading 27.5% 4-wall contribution margin transformed into 40%+ as a result of stacking automation efficiencies across operational and clinical workflows–scheduling, RCM, documentation, treatment plan generation, and clinical decision support.

The exceptionally profitable and scalable nature of the ANNA model is extensible beyond autism care, and the underlying people, playbooks, and product infrastructure built at ANNA give Blueprint a compelling opportunity to win these markets leveraging adjacencies and clear advantages.

The core comparison to this model is Amazon, leveraging the platform shift of the internet to initially build the “Earth’s Biggest Bookstore,” and systematically grow by adjacency across a shared set of continually growing advantages to where it is today. Lastly, Amazon’s decentralized leadership model enabled Amazon to take a commanding lead in such a widespread and disparate set of businesses built on core advantages.

This same opportunity of leveraging a platform shift to capture adjacencies, compound advantages, and decentralize organizationally exists today in the $2.5 trillion healthcare services market.

# Traction

When starting ANNA, there were 5 main pillars that we needed to demonstrate both strong success and repeatability in so we could set the foundation for rapid scale:

Referral Generation: We could consistently attract referral volume capital efficiently to ANNA’s centers

Recruiting: We could repeatably attract high quality clinicians to ANNA

Clinical Excellence: We could deliver exceptional clinical outcomes for our clients

P&L Efficiency: We could drive a strong 4-wall contribution margin

Unit Economic Efficiency: We could drive strong 4-wall economics (MOIC and payback period)

## Referral Generation

Referral generation was one of the first variables we were able to prove, far outpacing initial expectations in our core Middlesex market with Sudbury’s launch and led to us doubling down with our Wayland location. In every location, ANNA has a waiting list for services that we are actively processing through.

ANNA FDE Clients and ARR at Assessment, 3/1/24 - 10/1/25

Importantly growth compounds as it is sub-market specific, so as we open more locations, we open up new avenues for growth.

Also notable is the growth is highly capital efficient given the outsized LTV of intensive intervention services.

ANNA Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)

## Recruiting

ANNA has had strong success recruiting clinicians based predominantly on three factors: 1) Word-of-mouth referrals from staff, 2) Market-level brand awareness, and 3) Attraction to new clinical model. In particular the clinical model attraction has allowed us to meaningfully expand the population of BTs we can bring into ANNA given our internal training infrastructure.

ANNA BT Funnel Economics, YTD 2025

YTD in 2025, we have had 2,549 applicants for the BT position, of which we have accepted 69, representing a 2.7% acceptance rate.

BCBAs have been similarly strong given a similar set of factors, with additional future volume deriving from our Master’s tuition reimbursement program, wherein we can invest in our team and create our own BCBAs.

ANNA BCBA Funnel Economics, YTD 2025

YTD in 2025 we have had 124 applicants for the BCBA position, of which we have accepted 13, representing a 10.5% acceptance rate.

Similar to growth, as we expand locations, we expand access to clinicians in the market, compounding underlying growth.

## Clinical Excellence

The Vineland Adapt Behavior Scale (VABS) is broadly considered the most expansive outcome metric for autism services, as it measures comprehensive development across various domains against a representative peer set. ANNA’s outcome metrics have been proven to far outpace competition across all major domains, which accelerates the flywheel of attracting families, clinicians, and favorable payor contracting.

## P&L Efficiency

ANNA was initially able to demonstrate ~25% 4-wall contribution in line with leading healthcare services companies when initially ramping centers; however, as will be described in more detail below, the incorporation of technology both into the operational workflows and particularly into the clinical workflows of the company have materially improved the margin structure. The benefit of automating previously manual unbillable time for clinicians is that the increase in billable time benefits from operating leverage as at the unit level provider’s time is a fixed cost so incremental billing drives outsized impacts on margin, as shown below:

ANNA BCBA Margin Profile Pre and Post AI

## Unit Economic Efficiency

More importantly than margin profile is the 4-wall economic model, which ultimately determines the amount of exponential growth that the business is capable of maintaining using internally generated cash flows. ANNA’s first center demonstrated remarkable 4-wall economics, breaking even within 4-months of opening and with less than $100,000 of investment. At $1 million in annualized profit, this amounts to an organic opportunity for 10x exponential growth from internally generated cash flows.

ANNA Sudbury Center-Level Economics

# Multi-Site Expansion

With the foundation set in our first center in Sudbury, ANNA has leaned in considerably into multi-site expansion. The first location was in Wayland down the street from Sudbury in the same sub-market given we filled Sudbury’s capacity (note, Sudbury is a smaller footprint of ~4,900 square feet so 20 FDE clients, and with one BCBA on maternity leave we had a capacity cap of 15 when opening Wayland).

ANNA Wayland ARR, March 2025 - August 2025

ANNA’s second location in Wayland outpaced the first location to $1 million in ARR within just 4-months of opening. Further, the Weston location is active as of this month and already has 5 FDE clients waiting to start services, creating an opportunity to open the location up profitable within the very first month.

Our real estate approach in Greater Boston consists of identifying the 7 core markets that make up greater Boston: 1) Middlesex, 2) Central, 3) North Shore Inside 95, 4) South Shore Inside 95, 5) North Shore, 6) South Shore, and 7) Worcester County and opening locations in each.

We have identified locations in each of these markets to open up new locations, with 4 locations open today (Sudbury, Wayland, Weston, and Woburn) and 1 location in construction (Braintree) and an additional 3 LOIs signed (Foxborough, Andover, and Worcester) each slated to open in Q1 2026. This compounds growth because each of these centers operates in a net new sub-market, which increases the reach for both referrals and clinician recruiting as mentioned prior, which generates the underlying exponential growth curve for the market.

ANNA Lease Locations, Greater Boston

Across just these 8 locations, ANNA can generate PF ARR of ~$40mm and contribution profit of ~$16 million, which makes the Massachusetts market highly profitable relative to the expected ~$4mm in corporate expense.

ANNA 2025 - 2026 Projections

The major learning from Sudbury and Wayland is that each sub-market can support more than 1 fully-ramped center, which means that the ~$35 million in top-line revenue across these 7 sub-markets is a fraction of the possible SAM. Indeed, ANNA centers can fit 30 - 60 clients at maturity, and our average sub-market have 2,000 - 5,000 autistic kids aged 1 - 6. At 3 centers per sub-market (90 - 180 clients), this is a $105 million top-line opportunity in Greater Boston alone. This is before consideration of Springfield and other large metros in Massachusetts outside of Boston.

# Market Expansion

## Summary

With regards to market expansion, there are effectively 4 main workstreams that are completed in order to effectively open a market: 1) Licensing with the state, 2) Contracting with Payors, 3) Recruiting a GM, and 4) Real Estate. These are often parallel processes, though some dependency may arise such as waiting on the license for contracting with payors. The fifth related but separate workstream comprises all four, which is growing via acquisition. The acquisition automatically unlocks licensing, contracting, and real estate (though recruiting we aim to install our own GM at the market-level). As shown below, in Massachusetts we have completed all of these workstreams.

Massachusetts Market Expansion Trajectory

We are parallel process opening five other markets: 1) Washington, 2) Arizona, 3) Indiana, 4) Minnesota, and 5) Missouri.

## Washington

In Washington we are both fully licensed and fully contracted in the state with Regence, Premera, and Kaiser Permanente (the last of which is a highly unique relationship given Kaiser’s tendency to work internally). We are opening this market via an MSO BCBA who is operating under her own brand but using ANNA’s TIN and operational infrastructure. Given the synergistic relationship between home-based services through an MSO and our center-based model, we can freely double down on the market with our core ANNA model when convenient.

## Arizona

In Arizona, we have completed the state licensing process and are in process of contracting, hiring a GM, and real estate selection. We have mapped out the real estate options in the market and will begin touring them once we hire a GM into the market.

ANNA Arizona Target Sub-Markets

## Indiana

In Indiana, our traction is very similar, with the state licensing already completed and actively contracting with payors and beginning a search for a market GM. We also have a map of our target real estate locations that we will begin touring with our real estate brokers in the market.

Indiana Market Expansion Trajectory

ANNA Indiana Sub-Market Analysis

## Minnesota

Minnesota is the first market that we are planning to enter via acquisition. While we have parallel processed organic market entry, the market is closed to new entrants as they roll out comprehensive licensure. This presents a strong tailwind as there’s an opportunity to solidify a strong presence in the market without new entrants via a highly attractive M&A opportunity. We have already identified the target, a small home-based operator known as Western Autism Services, which we can buy in full for < $500K, much of it deferred.

In so doing, we accelerate across all of the other market expansion workstreams, with a parallel process for a GM who’s helping lead the corporate development process, Prashant Dilwali.

Minnesota Market Expansion Trajectory

ANNA Minnesota Target Locations

## Missouri

Lastly Missouri is an opportunistic market that we’re also evaluating in the context of a small acquisition. We are negotiating terms with a seller in the state who is a clinician looking to offload the administrative burden, allowing us to insource great clinical talent through an inexpensive “acqui-hire” and accelerate market entry. This process is more nascent than the Minnesota acquisition process and less strategic as we can choose to enter organically.

Missouri Market Expansion Trajectory

# Impact of AI on Economics

ANNA previously demonstrated strong operational execution in Sudbury upon maturity, generating a contribution margin of ~26.7%, in line with Key Autism’s 27.7% EBITDA margin in 2020A; however, the significant margin uplift arose after incorporating AI into the operational and clinical workflows, driving volume to the centers and achieving trailing-3-months (“T3M”) contribution profit in Sudbury of 42.1%.

Impact of AI on Contribution Margin

Because of the operating leverage in the unit model, greater utilization of just ~25% more billable across the center drives an outsized ~53% increase in contribution profit, which fundamentally redefines the nature of healthcare services as an investable category from a scalability and capital efficiency perspective.

To high-level quantify the impact of the tools in use today, the utilization improvements drive significant economic benefit to both the clinicians and to ANNA via automating or streamlining previously manual or inefficient tasks.

# Blueprint Trajectory

Blueprint’s success derives from ANNA’s success, and just as we set to build the foundation for ANNA’s initial center before leaning in to expansion across units and then proved out the multi-site economics and underlying playbooks before leaning into opening new markets, Blueprint represents the next iteration of the compounding growth trajectory.

The initial growth of ANNA into 2026 will be primarily focused on hiring world class general managers to decentralize decision-making and create a scalable, repeatable approach to market expansion.

ANNA Market-Level P&L

This same principle applies operationally to Blueprint, which is one of the major drivers of the HoldCo OpCo structure. Decision-making at the individual market level is decentralized to the market-level GM and overseen by ANNA executive leadership. Similarly, decision-making within the operating company is decentralized to the operating company leadership with structural support from the holding company.

Blueprint Structure

There are two key insights in the Blueprint model: 1) The exceptional de novo economics underpinning ANNA’s business are common amongst other specialties and 2) The underlying people, playbooks, and product infrastructure built at ANNA gives Blueprint a unique advantage to win these markets.

Starting with the commonalities across specialties, as previously noted, the criteria for application are the following:

Clinical Quality: a compelling opportunity to leverage a high quality, evidence-based clinical model that is not widely practiced in order to improve the quality of services via the institutionalization of clinical AI infrastructure.

Multi-Specialty: ability to layer on adjacent and ancillary services to better serve patients and build toward a center-of-excellence with amortization of aggregate costs against the various service lines.

Outpatient: low capital expenditure enabling exponential return-on-invested-capital and rapid payback periods to continually fund growth organically, while bringing costs to payor partners down as compared to inpatient care.

Underserved: insufficient supply of dedicated or quality providers lending toward solving an important access problem in addition to delivering higher quality services

Following with the core advantages, Blueprint leverages ANNA’s competencies to bring to bear the following points of value:

AI Clinical Infrastructure: Customized clinical AI tooling including LMS, point-of-care, and fidelity to scale the highest quality clinical model

AI Operational Infrastructure: Operational AI customized into business workflows and tech stack by forward-deployed engineer to expand provider capacity by streamlining non-clinical workflows

Payor Network Development: Deep, centralized relationships with payors to expand reach and create mutually favorable contracting structures

Operations Playbook: Comprehensive operational playbook across all key functions

Talent: Top tier talent from centralized CIR, CIT model

To accelerate the strong growth within ANNA through the Blueprint model, the initial foundation building will need to occur well beyond when the companies initially go live. The key hires at the Blueprint level are the following:

Chief Technology Officer: The CTO search is already queued up with Riviera Partners, but the CTO will ultimately be responsible for creating the architecture and building + leading the team that generalizes the Blueprint technology stack into the core platform that is then pulled into each operating company (see below)

Company Creation Pods: The company creation pods consist of an Investor-in-Residence (IIR), a Forward Deployed Engineer (FDE), and a CEO-in-Training (CIT). This trio should spend months-to-years conducting diligence on NewCo concepts before greenlighting them for launch to ensure the OpCo’s meet the criteria of the Blueprint model

Central Leadership: Over time, a full executive bench will be built at the HoldCo level to institutionalize the playbooks across growth, product, legal, and finance to support the operating companies in their initial formation stages as well as through the journey

The most direct comparable to this business model and strategy is Amazon. Amazon began in the 1990s as an online bookstore, leveraging the platform shift toward the internet to build the “Earth’s Biggest Bookstore,” the eCommerce business model of selling books that ultimately led to the company’s IPO in 1997. Amazon’s first extension beyond books was through adjacencies like CDs, DVDs, and electronics, all of which had three commonalities:

Standardized SKUs: Products are standardized and don’t require in-person inspection

Compact and Lightweight: Low shipping costs and minimal damage risk

Long-Tail Catalogs: Delivered value through a larger variety than any competitor

Similarly, Amazon leveraged core infrastructure across each of these products:

Warehousing & Logistics: Amazon’s fulfillment infrastructure had significant economies of scale when incorporated greater throughput, especially for standardized SKU products

Customer Relationship: Amazon centralized the purchasing decision through their site, removing friction from the purchase process (reliable, customer-centric)

Search & Recommendations Algorithms: Amazon owned the relationship with the customer, allowing for cross-sell based on customer interests

Intentionally, Amazon is not organized functionally but in a Single-Threaded Ownership model, where there is one leader who is wholly accountable for one business, and they run a vertically integrated business unit with its own product, engineering, marketing, and operations in an independent way. Amazon has some functional centers, but these are shared services such as finance, human resources, and legal.

Today, we are in the midst of a new platform shift that has created another opportunity to compound success across verticals built on core institutionalized advantages and implemented through decentralized leadership in the $2.5 trillion healthcare services market.
