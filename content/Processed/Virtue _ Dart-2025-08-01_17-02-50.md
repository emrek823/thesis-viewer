### Technical Architecture & Data Flow

- Data feeds through SQL connection with embeddings model powering autopilots for ongoing applications
- Three core models handle organizational processes, rules, and missed functionality
- LLM selection depends on customer use case depth
	- Home health/hospice customers average 200+ rules across multiple business lines
	- Complex cases require extensive rule-building vs. simple configurations

### Customer Implementation & Onboarding

- Striking balance for quick expertise development
	- 6-8 hour sessions creating full reports with extensive questioning
	- AI models perform super in-depth research alongside expert consultation
- Large health system onboarding process
	- 5 examples needed for initial setup
	- 100 examples required for embeddings model fine-tuning
	- Request fake patient chart examples from customers as “perfect” templates
- Custom rules approach varies by system size
	- Smaller systems: custom rule changes with super-user access (Jill as SME example)
	- Larger systems: more complex implementation requirements

### Performance & Technical Challenges

- Very hard to build - LLM analysis of multiple information pieces for independent conclusions
	- Chunking different information with clear separation using time scales and metadata tags
	- Home health/hospice complexity: physician orders change 2-4x monthly with 5+ items requiring LLM differentiation
- Customer case: 400 business rules (home health + primary care)
	- Initial 80% accuracy with best LLMs and long reasoning
	- Fine-tuning with simpler LLM improved performance significantly
	- New information LLMs hadn’t previously accessed required multiple fine-tuning iterations

### Economics & Pricing Model

- Cost structure: 1000 charts/month = $100/month operational cost
- Gross margins breakdown
	- Most popular: Gemini 2.0 Flash, upgrading to 2.5
	- $50K customer example: 400 patients, $250 monthly cost
	- APE (Application Programming Expert): $50/hour, maximum 10 hours/month
- Maxim Healthcare ($2B/year revenue)
	- 50 critical skilled nursing rules across 120+ US locations
- Albany Med transition with Kim - new team performing excellently

### Health Systems & Commercial Strategy

- Health system expansion requirements
	- Data feeds across different instances
	- Custom workflow actions and patient engagement system integration
	- Fine-tuning investment: 2 weeks annotation + 1 week validation + cleanup
- ETL and AI monitoring focus
	- Popular use case demonstrations vs. everything-ready approach
	- Manual workbench result compilation for basic model showcasing
- Commercial path to $10M ARR
	- Guerrilla marketing leveraging Atrium success case
	- AE/BDR strategy still developing
- Regulatory considerations
	- 6-day deep dive on AiDoc FDA route analysis
	- FDA clearance requirements for algorithm deployments under evaluation
