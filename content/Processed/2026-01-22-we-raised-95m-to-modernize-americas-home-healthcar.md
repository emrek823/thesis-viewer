# We raised $9.5M to Modernize America's Home Healthcare Infrastructure | Phoebe

America is entering the age of care. By 2034, there will be more Americans over 65 than under 18. The largest workforce of the 2030s will be caregivers and aides. Care — long-term, and acute — is structurally shifting out of dedicated facilities and into the home.

At its core, in-home care is a 3-sided, 24/7 logistics network of ~48,000+ agencies orchestrating ~5m+ workers to patients and families that need care delivered in their homes.

This workforce, and the agencies that coordinate them, are critical infrastructure to the country. While AI eats on-screen labor, in-home care is not just staying on our soil, but growing in importance: it's a $160b+ market growing ~9% annually with no slowdown in sight as 10,000+ Americans turn 65 everyday and hospitals and payers shift care away from acute and nursing facilities to the home.

However, the economics of this system are failing: back-office operations consume ~15% of every dollar payers, patients, and families are spending on care while reimbursements continue to fall. Agencies are left skating on increasingly razor-thin margins.

These agencies run on overclocked, high-churn scheduling labor, out-of-date software, pencil and paper. Admin tasks like scheduling, intake, authorizations vacuum up time, attention, and money away from the people delivering and receiving the care.

AI can and *should* do this work: self-driving agencies mean better pay for caregivers and more time for high-touch, human care.

A network of agents

We are building the agent-native logistics infrastructure for this market. Starting with agents for the agencies, Phoebe is building a network of agents that represent, coordinate, and transact on behalf of all three sides:

* Back office agents to run agencies end-to-end, bringing operational peace and profitability
* Talent agents for workers to find work, maximize earnings and perfect their schedule
* Care manager agents for family to find and manage care

Agents eat the admin, overhead, and chaos. The logistics — intake, scheduling, coordination, claims — fade into the background, and quietly hum along 24/7. Agencies are profitable: owners and care managers can allocate time, attention, and money to high-quality care. Nurses and caregivers are paid great, sustainable wages. Care just works.

A new type of company

Traditionally, there have been two strategies for vertical tech:

* **Trad SaaS:** High margin, low control. You sell the tool, but rely on customers using it well.
* **Tech-enabled operator:** High control, high burden. You run the business yourself around bespoke-and-better tooling, but then are running two kinds of companies at once.

Phoebe is taking door Nº 3 as LLMs allow us to create increasingly "self-driving" software that can think, decide, take action, and use itself and other tools.

We design and build the playbook to run agencies better, while our agents execute it, 24/7, across an agency's existing EHR and infrastructure. This means no new tools, no reliance on human behavior change. Agents mean we can bring operational peace and profitability, at scale.

“The only thing in the last 20 years that has revolutionized our operational workflow is Phoebe. I just don't see a future in home care that doesn't involve it.”

“Confirmations was a job of one person—like a whole day. Now Phoebe does it on her own, and the daily checks prevent next-day damage.”
