ParkourSC

Background

5.5 years at Veeva before joining Parkour 6 months ago

CEO @ ParkourSC - SV veteran. Started and sold 6 different companies

More resilient and what are the probabilities of that happening

Parkour Overview

Strong in pharma. ThermoFisher, Takeda, Novartis, GSK (about to close). Use cases around logistics

Cold chain

Full end to end visibility

Complexity and quantity of frequency - packages and things in transit

Planning to make sure we can do things to make demand

Started out as vertically integrated IoT - light it up and provide panoramic view and excursion in transit

Now we’re moving more into this area of visibility

Connective tissue and intelligence sitting on top of overlay to existing systems - TMS, WMS, layer on top

Schema less data ingestion is our differentiator - bring in data in any format, flat file, IoT sensor, API call. Then we can connect

A lot of these signals come in and can’t do it in real-time

We identify certain insights - this carrier has bad performance. Let’s try a different route or carrier

Buy more inventory upfront to reduce shipping costs because we keep running out

Margin, cost efficiency, utilization from a mfg conversation

Cold chain / logistics

Layup - that is the easiest thing and we have out of the box

800+ pre-built integrations for sensors, systems, carriers,

97% pharma / life sciences revenue today

Takeda - long standing customers and biggest producer of plasma. Minor infractions - exposed to ambient temperature over an hour its done

The sensor is pinging at whatever rate you want it to be at. Any time it has an extrusion out of the range.  Immediately get remedied and resolved depending on where you’re sending that information. Send an alert to the 3PL.

Real-time remedy of the shipment

You know that it’s been tracking this entire journey and you don’t have to run analytics to see what happened

Series C and acquiring a business (UK-based analytics company)

Early next year

Reoccurring software revenue - ARR $20M

If we break it down, we provide

Layer 1 - visibility

Layer 2- predicting what can happen

Layer 3- optimize what can happen

Pharma - carry a bigger stick and enforce what technologies to use

Naturally evolved into CDMOs, CROs, -

CDMOs - optimize production planning and forecasting and we can do hyperscale processing

Couple months and unlock and augmenting

We do see these other technologies and companies pharma is spending money on

Connexus - supply chain planning company

$10M for SAP instance. 5-7 year journey

IT department has been paved with SAP

Smaller guys - track and trace / cold chain / logistics. $300-$500K. Typically entry point for software. Another couple $100K for implementation
