## Abstract

Smartphone-based tele-dermatology assumes that colorimetric calibration ensures clinical reliability, yet this remains untested for underrepresented skin phototypes. We investigated whether standard calibration translates to reliable clinical biomarkers using 43,425 images from 965 Korean subjects (Fitzpatrick III-IV) across DSLR, tablet, and smartphone devices. While Linear Color Correction Matrix (CCM) normalization reduced color error by 67-77% -- achieving near-clinical accuracy (Delta E < 2.3) -- this success did not translate to biomarker reliability.   We identify a phenomenon termed "color-clinical decoupling": despite perceptual accuracy, the Individual Typology Angle (ITA) showed poor inter-device agreement (ICC = 0.40), while the Melanin Index achieved good agreement (ICC = 0.77). This decoupling is driven by the ITA formula's sensitivity to b* channel noise and is further compounded by anatomical variance. Facial region accounts for 25.2% of color variance -- 3.6x greater than device effects (7.0%) -- challenging the efficacy of single-patch calibration. Our results demonstrate that current colorimetric standards are insufficient for clinical-grade biomarker extraction, necessitating region-aware protocols for mobile dermatology.
