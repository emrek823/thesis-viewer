# Amperos Health Pitch Deck

## Slide 1: Amperos Health - AI coworkers that get claims paid

## Slide 2: Problem - Healthcare providers struggle to get paid

*   Obstacles imposed by insurance companies include asking for documentation, creating unique rules, not providing updates on claim status, and more
*   Most of the administrative burden is related to **denied claims**, which clinics address today by having staff call insurance, write letters, fill out forms, etc.

## Slide 3: How Big is the Problem?

*   **$9bn+** Administrative spend by healthcare systems on appeals
*   **$90bn** Recoverable revenue denied by insurance to hospitals alone
*   **20%** Increase in denials in last 2 years
*   **12%** Of claims denied
*   **~45 min** To process complex appeals
*   **$118** Administrative costs per appeal

## Slide 4: Why Aren't Others Solving the Problem?

### All-in-One EMRS
*   Epic
*   Cerner
*   athenahealth
    *   Focus on EMR product (sales "mousetrap")
    *   Poor UX
    *   Limited history of innovation

### RCM Software
*   Athelas
*   Enter
*   WAYSTAR
    *   Requires replacement of existing RCM (mission critical software)
    *   Limited LLM-based AI implemented to date

### "RPA Automators"
*   UiPath
*   AKASA
*   appian
*   PEGA
    *   Poor UX
    *   Difficult to create new automations
    *   Not built for purpose

## Slide 5: What's the Solution?

### Vision
*   Team of AI coworkers, each tailored to a specific denial workflow
*   "Sits on top" of existing customer software
*   LLM tailored to reflect best strategy for a specific sub-specialty and payor

### Result
*   Billing staff transforms from "doers" to strategic decision makers
*   Time to process a denial goes from 20-45 min to <1 min
*   Slash cost to collect, decrease AR days, increase revenue
*   AI reflects tactics used by best billers

## Slide 6: Why now?

1.  **Clinics are feeling increasing pressure**
    *   Inflation of employee compensation (~⅓ of costs)
    *   Increasing employee turnover since pandemic (50-100% higher)
    *   CMS reimbursement rate growth below cost inflation
    *   Declining profit margins
2.  **Advent of LLMs**
    *   For the first time, managing unstructured data is possible, making fully autonomous AI coworkers possible

## Slide 7: Industry, Product and Technical Expertise to Execute on Strategy

## Slide 8: First AI Coworker - Amanda, for Calling Insurance

*   Autonomously collects information on claim status, denial reason, and instructions for how to reverse the denial
*   Users cited calling insurance as #1 painful task
*   Collections team spend ~50% of time on calls with insurance
*   Calls often last up to 45-60 minutes

## Slide 9: AI Calling Demo: Amanda in Action

3:32 video showing end-to-end call request, including audio recording of Amanda calling for real claim

## Slide 10: Product Development Roadmap

*   **Insurance Calling** -> **Existing LLM**
*   Refine Model Through Collected Data
*   **Insurance Forms** -> **Appeal Letters** -> **Payer Policy Engine** -> **Decision Making** -> **End-to-End Coworker Experience**
*   **Proprietary Model** (derived from refined model and collected data)
*   End result is each biller has a team of coworkers, each specific to a task, working with little intervention
*   Increased data capture allows for model fine tuning, then training own model, increasing moat

## Slide 11: Customer Profile

### Characteristics
*   Complex and high dollar claims
*   Ancillary services (e.g. diagnostics, drugs, labs)

## Slide 12: Business Model

### AI Calling
*   Initially priced per minute, with minimum cost per call.
*   Converted after 3-6 months into annual contract.

### New Coworkers
*   Each AI coworker product will be priced based on size and complexity of enterprise customer

### Long Term
*   Aim to price at ~20% of value of recovered revenue

Estimated ~$700mm SAM for AI calling, ~$30bn TAM for denial coworkers

## Slide 13: Ask:

Raising ~$650k in pre-seed funding to pay founder salaries + hire 1-2 other technical or billing staff
