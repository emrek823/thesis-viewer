Amae Health: Building The Future of AI-Powered Mental Healthcare

Who we are: From Day 1, Amae has been a care provider and research organization focused on treating patients with severe mental illness.

Our vision: To become the "Sloan Kettering" of mental healthcare – a center of excellence driven by data and research, delivering personalized and transformative care. Our goal is to develop a cure for severe mental illnesses → in cancer, cure means 5 years of remission of symptoms. We have had members in our care for 2.5 years and counting who are symptom free and are working towards developing a long-term cure.

The problem we solve: The $300 billion and rapidly growing US SMI market (over 15 million individuals) suffers from a lack of data-driven, personalized care. Psychiatrists, therapists, and mental health providers are not using data to inform treatment planning, and therefore patients are not getting customized treatment fit for their unique needs. The alternative is non-profit community mental health centers that do not prioritize quality nor innovation, which has led to ineffective care and poor outcomes across the industry. Additionally, there is no continuum of care → patients get hospitalized and discharged with no plan which leads to a continued cycle of hospitalizations.

Our solution: The first of its kind AI data platform for mental health clinicians and patients

Amae is building the first integrated AI data platform for severe mental illness–transforming how care is delivered by clinicians, improving outcomes for patients, and creating long-term competitive advantage for Amae. Developed on Palantir Foundry by Andrew Girvin (former Chief Science Officer at Palantir), our dual-platform brings together timely provider insights and personalized patient support.

AI data platform for providers: Empowering providers with real-time, data-driven insights, patient summaries, and clinical decision tools–streamlining personalized care for patients. This also has a ChatEHR feature where providers can Chat with all of a patients medical records including prompting recorded transcriptions for both what was said as well as sentiment analysis

AI data platform for patients (AmaeBetter/Amae OS): Our patient-facing platform that delivers personalized patient support that enhances engagement, adherence, and expedites recovery.

Integrated Data Flywheel: EPIC EMR data from our clinics feeds directly into our AI platforms, generating actionable insights that continuously improve both provider tools and patient care.

Why AI Matters for Amae:

Competitive Differentiation: Technology sets us apart and attracts patients.

Enhanced Patient Engagement & Outcomes: Leading to higher payor contracts and more health system partnerships.

Increased Clinician Efficiency (Operating Leverage): Enabling better care with optimized time, leading to higher caseloads and improved margins.

Data Moat: Further establish a data moat as we have deeper longitudinal data on a more complex population than anyone else

We believe that without robust, high-quality data, most mental health AI companies will fall short of delivering meaningful impact for patients. At Amae, we see the immense potential in combining our proprietary dataset with AI-driven tools and the expertise of our clinical teams to redefine how care is delivered for individuals with severe mental illness.

Also NIMH grant proposal with leading Yale & UCLA researchers specializing in biomedical data science and machine learning

Amae Institute: Education Partnership with Massachusetts General Hospital [Link to BHB Press Release] for standardizing clinical protocols and education

Hiring: Hired experienced executive team and scaled recruitment of clinicians; led by former One Medical talent team. Team has grown from 15 in January 2024 to 80 in May 2025

COO - Amy Finney (former VP of Ops, 12 Years at One Medical)

CSO - Rick Idemoto (former Chief Strategy Officer at Stanford Children's Hospital)

Head of AI - Andrew Girvin (former 14 Years & former Chief Science Officer at Palantir)

Head of Member Experience - Kelly Georgiou (former Program Director, Sensei Four Seasons)

Other key hires include Director of Talent (One Medical), strong clinical recruiting team, experienced operators from One Medical, Hinge Health, Strive Health, Forward and other organizations

Raised Strategic Capital: Raised additional capital from Cedars-Sinai and CommonSpirit to partner with their health systems

Financial Position and Highlights

Strong Unit Economics:

High Lifetime Value (LTV): $30,000 - $60,000+ per patient annually (depending on payor) before additional revenue opportunities

Significant EBITDA Margins: Up to 55% demonstrated in our initial Los Angeles clinic, with room to grow

Rapid Path to Growth: With our first health system partner (NYP), we treated >75 members in the first 6 months of launch, with >90% intake conversion rate. NYP has asked us to open multiple additional locations

Ancillary Revenue Opportunities:

TMS (90% GM) - We have contracts at 200% of Medicare, which pay ~$10K per patient at a 90% gross margin

Spravato - We have negotiated contracts with California BlueShield and Aetna that include high reimbursement for Spravato, which could generate up to ~$18K of FCF per patient

Collaborative Care Management (CoCM) - Additional reimbursement for primary care, ~$100-200 additional revenue per member per month

Potential to build operating systems for hospitals psychiatry departments (preliminary conversations with NewYork Presbyterian on this)

Competitive Advantage: Our care-delivery-driven AI model differentiates us from other unsuccessful approaches to SMI by companies that did not do care delivery and had intermediary approaches solely (e.g., Vanna, First Hand). Our proprietary patient data moat will make it difficult for new players to catch up to us.

Use of Funds:

We have ~$17M of capital currently and do not need to fundraise. However, due to our traction, we have signed more health system partnerships than expected in a very short period of time, and with additional capital, we can execute on 24 months of growth within the next 12 months.

Accelerate the development and deployment of our proprietary AI technology platform (AmaeBetter/Amae OS).
