## Slide 2: The $80B+ clinical trial industry is broken.

# RYght.
The $80B+ clinical trial industry is broken.
Sponsors want to “bend the curve” and get drugs to market sooner and at lower cost

**Chart: Clinical Trial Industry Lifecycle with Investment/Revenues**

**Phases (from left to right):**
*   **EARLY**
    *   Phase 0
    *   Phase 1
    *   Phase 2
    *   Phase 3
    *   Intro
*   **MIDDLE**
    *   Growth
    *   Maturity
    *   Decline
*   **LATE**
    *   Generic Competition

**Key Points on the timeline:**
*   Discovery
*   Launch
*   Loss of Market Exclusivity

**Timeline durations:**
*   12 years (from Discovery to Launch)
*   22 years (from Discovery to end of Generic Competition)

**Arrows on the curve indicate:**
*   A downward arrow near "Discovery" (Investment/Revenues are negative).
*   An upward arrow leading from "Discovery" towards "Launch" (Investment/Revenues increase).
*   A large horizontal arrow pointing left from the "Growth" phase, indicating a desire to shorten this period.
*   A large downward arrow from "Maturity" towards "Launch", indicating a desire to reduce time to market.

The opportunity

## Slide 3: The problems are costing billions

# RYght.
The problems are costing billions

**Left Section:**
*   55% of clinical trials fail due to low accrual....
*   ...failed trials cost up to **$1.4B**
*   **Pie Chart: $81B**
    *   Biopharma (Largest segment, unspecified percentage)
    *   Med Device (Smaller segment, unspecified percentage)
    *   Other (Smallest segment, unspecified percentage)
*   In an **$81B** labor intensive industry

**Right Section: Old school challenges drive exploding costs**
*   **Activating one site:** $50,000
*   **Enrolling 1 patient:** $50,000 – $500,000
*   **20% of sites:** Enroll 80% of patients
*   **11% of sites:** No patients
*   **Result:** Waste

## Slide 4: Vision

# RYght.
Vision

We are creating an AI-enabled digital twin of every clinical
trial site in the world to remove the bottlenecks in clinical
trials for biopharma - by driving accurate and fast site
selection, activation and enrollment against a fast
growing, global network of AI-enabled trial sites.

Why now?
LLMs unlock opportunity to focus on upstream site activation to drive real change

## Slide 14: ROI: ID and activate better sites faster

# RYght.
ROI: ID and activate better sites faster
We can drive $5M+ in savings for one small rare disease trial (n= 6)

**Comparison Diagram: OLD SCHOOL WAY vs. THE RYght. WAY**

**OLD SCHOOL WAY:**
*   **Sponsor** (icon)
    *   Hires CRO
    *   Old feasibility process (icon)
    *   Leads to 14 Sites activated (building icons)
    *   Only **4 sites enroll ALL the patients (29%)**
    *   Results in **6 rare disease patients enrolled** (patient icons)

**THE RYght. WAY:**
*   **Sponsor** (icon)
    *   Hires CRO
    *   **Ryght Agents** (network icon)
    *   Identify best sites, project patient counts, connect & activate
