Summary Financials – Cash, Burn, Runway

**Cash**: $3.5 million in bank - $200k (captive capital requirement) - $200k (loss account buffer required by Sirius) = $3.1m unrestricted cash

**Recurring monthly burn**: $60k salaries + $22k for dev shop = $82k monthly team comp
* + $16k prospective hires (software engineer + data science)
* + $22k data costs
* + $10k legal, insurance, actuarial, misc. ops
* + $10k business development
* = ~$140k recurring monthly burn

22 months of runway (25 including "restricted" cash) assuming current team + prospective hires, no revenue
