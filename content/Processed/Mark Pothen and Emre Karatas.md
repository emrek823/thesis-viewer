### Beacon Health Business Model Evolution

- Mark evolved from simple AI point solution to full practice COO model
	- Initially focused on value-based care but discovered practices don’t prioritize VBC due to bandwidth constraints on fee-for-service side
	- New approach: “Do nothing, change nothing - we’ll do all the work, you make money”
- Found $150k left on table at first practice across quality, risk adjustment gaps, AWVs, transitions of care
- Core thesis: All businesses need to become AI service businesses delivering actual outcomes
	- Client service front-end with blend of human, software, AI and computer usage agents
	- Own entire workflows to maintain pricing power and defensibility

### Current IPA Contract - 40k Lives

- Closed Innovative Physician Association deal in 2 weeks
- Onboarding 13 individual practices with different EHRs
	- Part of Tufts Integrated Network with 11 other IPAs underneath
	- MetroWest coverage: Medicare/MassHealth/Commercial split ~33% each
- Discovered $180M left on table across entire 11-IPA network in value-based contracts
- Pricing model:
	- Fee-for-service workflows: price per successful prior authorization, blended into single cost
	- Value-based care: 20% of upside (vs Aledade’s 50%)
	- Current contract: ~$55k through end of year, all performance-based with zero upfront

### Key Market Insights & Fundraising Plans

- Shocked by how little primary care docs understand money flows in their practices
- Population health management platforms (like Arcadia) are “pretty bad” - harder than expected to capture data and enable atomic actions
- Aledade/Agilon getting “cooked” - find winners vs enabling practices to actually do the work
- Fundraising target: $2.5-3M to achieve:
	- At least 5 more IPAs
	- At least 100 more practices
	- At least $2M ARR
- Considering attending Health in Vegas for efficient investor meetings and FOMO generation
