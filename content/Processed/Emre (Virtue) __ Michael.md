### Healthcare Startup Approaches Discussed

- Three main approaches to healthcare startups explored:
	- Longevity/wellness focus
	- Specialty-specific healthcare delivery
		- Potential areas: dermatology, GLP-1s, specific care journeys
		- Key advantage: Access to drug margins and pharma budgets
		- Challenge: Margins are tougher outside cardiology
	- Primary care with AI integration
		- Identified as hardest initial approach but potentially most valuable long-term
		- Goal: Create technology as good as or better than a doctor
		- Limited competition in direct patient-facing AI solutions

### Market Analysis

- Discussion of existing players:
	- Function’s business model relies on scale-driven lab test discounts
	- OpenEvidence raising at $3B valuation
	- Beeline (early stage) focusing on colonoscopy referrals
- Key opportunities:
	- Patient continuity across health plans (current 3-year churn problem)
	- Integration with health systems
	- Consumer-focused solutions versus backend RCM plays

### Next Steps

- Participant plans to:
	- Converge on initial wedge strategy by June
	- Likely relocate to San Francisco
	- Connect with Jamere (Valor cofounder)
- Follow-up:
	- Meet in San Francisco in June
	- Share dissertation materials
	- Continue discussion as ideas develop
