### Executive Summary

AI has rewritten the startup playbook. To understand how, we analyzed a dataset of over 10,000 companies from 2022 to 2025 and identified the top 100 fastest-growing AI-native startups. These startups look very different from their SaaS era counterparts.

**The most striking change is in the founders and teams.** Today’s breakout companies are led by deeply technical CEOs: PhDs, Olympiad medalists, and alumni of top AI labs. These teams are small but unusually productive and agile, often achieving revenue per employee five to ten times higher than the SaaS benchmarks. Their experimental mindset and fluency with the underlying models allow them to pivot quickly, often within months of founding, to find product-market fit.

**The business performance is equally dramatic.** After years of skepticism about AI monetization, 2024 marked a turning point. Dozens of startups crossed $10M ARR in under 18 months of founding their companies, mostly through self-serve, product-led adoption. Users experience value immediately, products spread virally inside organizations, and only once adoption reaches critical mass do formal sales motions begin

**The AI markets themselves are unfolding in sequence.** Horizontal tools like writing and coding assistants broke out first, followed by multimodal media tools and, more recently, vertical applications in healthcare, legal, and finance. Unlike past cycles where one winner dominated, multiple companies are scaling side by side, each securing moats through workflow depth, data advantages, or vertical specialization.

Taken together, these patterns suggest the AI era is reshaping both how companies are built and where value may ultimately accrue. Team size, sales motion, and revenue velocity look very different from the SaaS playbook. But there are many open questions that remain to be answered. How durable are these early advantages once foundation models absorb more functionality? Which verticals will unlock next as reliability improves? And what forms of defensibility, whether workflow depth, proprietary data, or regulatory moats, will prove long-lasting?

The rest of this report explores each of these patterns in depth, drawing on data from the top 100 AI startups from our dataset.

### About This Report

Leonis Capital is a research-driven venture firm focused on AI-native companies. Since 2021, we've partnered with technical founders at the earliest stages, combining technical expertise with institutional investing experience.

After three years of systematically tracking the AI startup ecosystem, we've seen patterns that we think are worth sharing with the AI community. Too much of the AI discourse is driven by hype and speculation. This report draws instead on one of the largest private datasets of AI startup metrics, built and maintained as part of our work as investors.

We hope this analysis helps the AI community reflect on what has and hasn’t worked in building AI startups.

#### Methodology & Dataset

Much of this data set is based on Alfa, our proprietary AI research system. Alfa continuously indexes and analyzes AI startups from around the world, tracking everything from GitHub commits to hiring velocity to revenue signals. It helps us scale our analysis as an AI-native venture firm.

Between 2022 and 2025, Alfa indexed more than 10,000 AI startups globally. From this universe, we identified the fastest-growing startups based on publicly available data and signals (funding, hiring, usage, GitHub activity, Crunchbase, Product Hunt, news announcements, and ARR estimations from sources like Sacra and ARR Club) and private references from founders and investors. We’ve aggregated that into the Leonis AI 100 to glean further insights on the fastest-growing AI startups.

To qualify, companies must be:

* Primarily focused on AI applications, not foundation model development, since these labs operate with fundamentally different capital intensity, GTM motions, and defensibility dynamics [1]
* Founded or built their product in the post-ChatGPT era (2022 or later), we excluded legacy companies that rebranded or pivoted into generative AI
* Building AI-native products (e.g., LLMs, agents, AI infrastructure, generative media, etc.)
* Independently operated (i.e., no spin-outs from Big Tech)
* Showing clear traction (e.g., revenue, users, open-source adoption)

We tagged each company by:

* Product category (infrastructure, agents, video, devtools, etc.)
* Founder backgrounds (research, ex-big tech, co-working history, age at founding, etc)
* Geography and location
* Founding date
* Investors (Pre-Seed, Seed, Series A, and Series B) [2]
* Round and valuation trajectory
* Revenue growth trajectory [3]
* Go-to-market motion (product-led, marketing-led, community-led, and sales-led) [4]
* Pivots and time-to-pivot

**All data is current as of September 2025.** We're a small team, and this is a fast-moving space. We've likely missed things. We've open-sourced the dataset and invite founders, operators, and fellow researchers to help us improve it.

### The State of AI Startups

The last three years in AI felt like three decades.

In November 2022, ChatGPT launched and changed everything. What followed was a gold rush of demos, Twitter threads, and breathless predictions about the future of software. But beneath the hype, a more interesting story was unfolding: the emergence of a new breed of startups that is defining company building in the AI era, deviating from the SaaS playbook that defined the previous era of successful ventures.

By early 2023, thousands of AI projects had sprung up, but revenue was lagging behind usage. Many observers were skeptical that these cool demos would turn into real businesses; some dubbed it an “AI bubble” and asked [where the revenue was](https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/ais-600b-question/).

The narrative changed dramatically in 2024. As model capabilities improved, customers began paying in earnest. Entire categories, from voice to video and early agent platforms, moved from demos to production. Revenue traction separated substance from hype, and the best startups proved they could scale quickly and efficiently.

In 2025, adoption began spreading into complex verticals such as healthcare, legal, and finance. These markets demand reliability, compliance, and workflow depth, traits that raise the bar but also create stronger moats for those who succeed.

In just three years, AI startups have moved from hype to skepticism to real traction, compressing an entire market cycle into a fraction of the time that it took companies in the previous eras of technology to build out its products and businesses. From our analysis, seven patterns stand out: who the founders are, how companies scale revenue, the structure of their teams, their go-to-market motion, the shape of competition, the speed and nature of pivots, and the order in which markets unlock. The sections that follow explore each of these dynamics in depth.

### Insight 1: The Rise of the Researcher Founder and Technical CEOs

The most striking pattern in our data isn't about products or markets, it's about the people building these companies. Today's AI founders look very different from those who dominated the last decade of startups. Looking back at the 2013 Unicorn Club, when Aileen Lee coined that term, she found that outlier outcomes came from [“well-educated, thirtysomething co-founders who have history together.”](https://techcrunch.com/2013/11/02/welcome-to-the-unicorn-club/) The dominant archetypes of that era were serial entrepreneurs with prior exits, scrappy hackers shipping consumer products, product managers with customer insights, and business operators with MBAs.

This is changing in the age of AI. Today's breakout AI startups are **overwhelmingly led by founders with elite technical and research backgrounds.** Berkeley PhDs, MIT researchers, International Math Olympiad medalists, and alumni from OpenAI or DeepMind have replaced MBAs and product managers in the CEO seat. The SaaS-era model of a business-background CEO paired with a technical CTO seems to be replaced by dual-technical teams. Across the Leonis AI 100, 82 out of 100 companies are led by technical CEOs, and a striking 208 of the total 241 founders (86%) are technical. By comparison, in the Unicorn Club, only 49% of companies had technical CEOs, and only 59% of founders were technical.

This rise could reflect two related forces. First, many more technical professionals are founding AI startups than in previous waves, as the barrier to entry has dropped and venture investors actively encourage researchers and engineers to start companies. Second, among those who do, the most technically fluent founders disproportionately succeed. [5]

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/QSwRQ3T2SXQhQny40T0VkRFhlo.png)

**The biggest shift shows up in research pedigree.** The vast majority (58%) of the startups in the Leonis AI 100 have at least one co-founder with a research background.[6] 40% of all founders in this cohort have research experience versus just 12% in the Unicorn Club. The rise of the “researcher founder” reflects a founder archetype that barely existed in the last wave. In the AI age, founders who have seen how frontier models are trained understand where capabilities are improving, which areas remain constrained, and what directions the labs are actively investing in. That insider knowledge helps them target opportunities just ahead of the curve, knowing, for example, which capabilities are likely to improve soon and which still require fundamental research breakthroughs.

Importantly, these aren't pure researchers who've spent decades in academia either. The most successful founders combine research credentials with a builder's urgency. Many did brief stints at top labs, just long enough to understand the frontier, but not so long that they lost their builder instincts.

**The rise of researcher founders originates from the fact that in AI, the tech** *is* **often the product.** Unlike in the SaaS era, where the tech is often just a medium for something else, like marketplaces for homes (Airbnb), taxi services (Uber), or e-commerce products, the core product in AI is the tech itself. AI companies compete on first-principles choices at the model, data, and system level, decisions that need leaders with deep technical and research expertise.

This dynamic extends to every aspect of building an AI company: VCs want to back founders who've shipped production AI systems, not those who have only managed teams that built them. The best AI engineers want to work for someone who understands their work at a deep level. Even customers, especially technical buyers, expect to discuss implementation details with someone who truly understands the underlying technology.

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/GPzlpYKPYpV4jwOFfTQCp9yKFko.png)

**While VCs love to claim that credentials don't matter, our data says otherwise.** More than 60% of the founders in our dataset have elite educational backgrounds, with degrees from MIT, Stanford, Harvard, and other top programs.[7] This continues a pattern from the last generation of unicorn founders, many of whom also came from prestigious schools. The difference in this wave is that those credentials are overwhelmingly technical: PhDs in computer science, EECS, or mathematics, and research experience at leading AI labs. Aravind Srinivas, CEO and cofounder of Perplexity, for example, completed his PhD at UC Berkeley and worked as a researcher at OpenAI before starting Perplexity. The Cursor team, though still undergraduates at MIT, had worked on AI research projects and were already paying attention to LLMs back in the GPT-2 era, spotting the AI coding opportunity before it became obvious.

**Team formation also looks different.** Only 12 of the AI 100 are founded by solo-founders, and while most companies have multiple co-founders (88%), just 40% had co-founders with a prior history of working together.[8] In contrast, almost all (88%) Unicorn Club companies had co-founders who had worked together before. Familiarity was the rule then; today, new teams form around technical opportunity rather than long personal history. Of course, some of this difference may reflect the stage of company building: the Unicorn Club companies were later-stage, while the AI 100 includes many earlier ventures, and the most successful among them may eventually converge to the patterns of the previous generation.

The average top AI founder is also **younger than their SaaS predecessors**, with a median age of 29 compared to 34 for SaaS. The most frequent age at founding is 26 or 27, nearly a decade younger than the prior cohort. These founders tend to jump directly from academia or research labs into startups rather than climbing the co
