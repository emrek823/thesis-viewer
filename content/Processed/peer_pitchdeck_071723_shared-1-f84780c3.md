**At each phase of development:**

| Phase Segment | Decision Point |
|---|---|
| **Pre** | Decision on trial design and geographic footprint dictates protocol, ICF, lab manual content |
| **During** | Decisions implementing strategic changes to trial generate new content requirements |
| **Post** | Decision dictating study report and manuscript |
| **New Drug Application** | **es** Decision on regulatory filing strategy dictating submission content |
| **Commercialization** | Decision on commercialization strategy & content including marcomms |
| **Commercialization** | Decision on medical affairs strategy including field-based medicine coverage for prescribers |
| **Phase 4** | **es** Post approval decisions regarding label expansion, PASS, etc. dictating all necessary regulatory, amendment and submission documents |
