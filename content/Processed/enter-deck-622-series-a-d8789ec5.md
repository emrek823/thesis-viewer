## Slide 7: Medical Billing is complex and disjointed.

**Content:**
Medical Billing is complex and disjointed.
Nothing is connected, so Billers have to manually move claims through
many different systems.

**Workflow Diagram (Key stages and issues):**
-   Patient pays CoPay
-   Claim submitted to payer electronically
-   Billing Module (Allscripts PM screenshot with "Automatic Transactions Appointment Scheduling")
-   Claim submitted to payer via Paper
-   Payment received from Payer
-   Payment imported into contract manager
-   Underpayments / Denials are appealed by Biller
-   Post adjudication, collect patient responsibility
-   Gather all data for reporting

**Poor Payer Performance:**
**48 Days**
cashgap (from date of
service to Payer Payment).
**28%**
leakage (underpaid claims
without follow up).

**Poor Patient Experience:**
**91 Days**
for a Patient to receive
their statement after date
of service.

**Expensive:**
**7.5%**
cost to collect +
adjudication costs

## Slide 23: "Healthcare AI" companies underperform because they try to automate parts of Medical Billing.

**Content:**
"Healthcare AI" companies underperform because they
try to automate parts of Medical Billing.
Enter's holistic approach is the complete solution that actually solves the whole the problem.

**Article Snippet: From AXIOS**

**Headline:** $4 billion health tech startup Olive overpromises and underdelivers

**Author:** Erin Brodwin
**Date:** Apr 5, 2022

**What's happening:** The savings Olive promises to clients are based on rough estimates. The company does not comprehensively track its progress unless a customer specifically requests it, according to sources and several internal and external documents reviewed by Axios.

*   "There are hospitals that won't touch [Olive] because they know people who've been burned," one former employee tells Axios. "And I think people don't want to admit it; there's a big sense of shame about it."

**The bottom line:**
Health care automation is a difficult and complicated business, and Olive — the leading company in the sector — is inflating its capabilities to drive more investment, rather than focusing on the quality of the product it delivers.
