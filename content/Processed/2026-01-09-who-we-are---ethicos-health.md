Who We Are

# Our Story of Innovation in Healthcare

## Our History

Ethicos Health was founded by a group of healthcare leaders to address the risk to plan sponsors, and the healthcare system at large, of the exorbitant cost created through a pharmacy payment system built on misalignment and obscure payment models.

## Our Point of View

**We believe a Clinical Efficacy approach honors both fiscal responsibility and patient welfare.**

The principle is straightforward: plans should pay for medications only when they demonstrably work for individual patients, as measured by whether they achieve their intended clinical endpoints. This isn’t about denying care or creating barriers. It’s about ensuring that the substantial resources we devote to specialty pharmacy actually translate into meaningful clinical outcomes.

Our platform allows plans to measure clinical efficacy to inform coverage decisions – rather than making eligibility determinations based solely on rebates, formularies, or financial arrangements that may not align with patient interests. Using our platform, payers can certify and re-certify medications based on whether they’re achieving their clinical goals for each member—nothing more, nothing less.

# Meet Our Team

Our team is composed of healthcare leadership with deep expertise in the challenges high pharmacy costs pose to employers and plan sponsors as they ensure high-quality, effective programs for their members.

“Today’s (and tomorrow’s) specialty drugs represent a massive opportunity to better serve patients. But they also pose serious risks to individual payer and self-funded employer group economics, and the healthcare system at large if pricing strategies and cost management aren’t effectively navigated.”
