## Slide 3

Problem with sales tax (post 2018)

After supreme court ruling, SaaS, e-commerce and services businesses must file sales tax where the customer resides (local nexus +economic nexus). Companies describe dealing with sales tax “… complete nightmare. time intensive, unintuitive, manual process that is hard to keep track of”
Current solutions require at least two people in finance and one person in HR working fulltime to collect required data to file sales tax correctly thus costing ~ $12000/mo
Post COVID era, sales tax has become much worse since companies now can unintentionally hit local nexus in different regions due to remote/hybrid work

---

## Slide 4

Market Size

There is 991 billion dollars in e-commerce + SaaS revenue in the US growing at a CAGR of 5.5% between 2023 - 2027 [1][2]  

In 2022, the average sales tax rate was 6% 

There are 46 out of 50 states that charge sales taxes on currently. 46/50 is 0.92 
 
991 Billion (ecommerce+SaaS  spend in the US) * 6% (avg sales tax rate) * 0.92( percent of states with sales tax in the US) 
= 54.7 Billion dollars per year

Also consider that companies’ willingness to pay to get the calculation and remittance automated






Note: As a public comparable, Avalara had 750M of ARR before they were acquired by Vista Equity partners for 8.4 Billion dollars

## Slide 8

Path to $100M ARR in the US alone

Businesses making more than 1M in the US

 have a sales tax liability of ~60,000/yr
 If they don’t comply, the average fines are ~10% [1] for the first month of non-compliance + 3-25% for every additional month 
Businesses at this stage are willing to pay $2000/mo to avoid penalties and have an end-to-end automated integration. There are over 100,000 such e-commerce,SaaS and services companies in the US 

Capture 5500 such companies (<1% penetration) and charge $18,000/yr generating $100m/yr

Avalara, at the time of going public, had 3% penetration in the US market, was making 765M ARR and had a market cap of $19 billion

## Slide 16

Is sales tax calculation super-complicated?

New York State has a low tax rate at just 4%. However, each county or city in the state adds its own sales tax. There is also a transit tax that some counties include in their sales tax. The result is that customers can expect to pay between 7% and 8.875% sales tax in New York 

In the city of Denver, CO a customer could walk one street over and would have to pay a different sales tax based on their location. The sales tax jurisdiction in every city and county are so complicated

If you hire an employee in Washington, you have to file sales tax every quarter even if companies report zero transactions in that area. Failing to comply leads to fines typically ~10% [1]

## Slide 17

Customer pipeline

Paid Ads in newsletters read by CEOs/CFOs

success in finding customers by doing paid ads in weekly and monthly newsletters that are sent to CEOs and CFOs 

Allows to create a healthy pipeline of businesses who are looking for sales tax solutions

Product Led Growth Motion

We allow companies to go online to our website and seeing their businesses’ sales tax liabilities without talking to a sales representative

Every week, we get 1 paid customer from this motion. People sign up, look at their sales tax exposure and liability and put down their credit card to put their sales tax on autopilot

Partnerships with accounting firms


success in partnering with other fractional CFO/accounting firms

This has allowed us to gain access to the  companies that use our partners for their businesses. It is a win-win synergy since it allows our partners to offer a sales tax solution to their customers while also giving us new customers

---

## Slide 18

Is filing sales tax annoying?

Sales tax portals are confusing and outdated. Most don’t have two factor authentication or single sign-on (SSO). For a business to keep track of all the portals’ credentials, the sales tax deadlines and the changing laws is very cumbersome

Sales tax laws are always changing. A senate bill can go in tomorrow and people could vote, and the law could change this fall making it impossible for companies to track all the changes
