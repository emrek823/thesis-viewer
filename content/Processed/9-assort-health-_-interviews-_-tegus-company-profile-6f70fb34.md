**Q: What was your involvement in the decision making process?**
A: Key decision maker

**Q: What other companies did you evaluate?**
A: a customer of FlipAi and have evaluated Elise and Assort.

### Client
I appreciate you taking some time today. I am interested in both healthcare and AI. Obviously spending time at the intersection of the two of them, specifically within voice agents. I would love to hear your thoughts on a company called Assort Health. Perhaps let's just kick off with I'd love to understand high level what TrustCare does briefly and then what your level of involvement was in evaluating Assort Health.

### Expert
We have 12 clinics in Mississippi. We have urgent care, primary care, and pediatric care. We also have a centralized lab, so in the lab business as well, and we see about 160,000 patient visits a year. My involvement in evaluating both Flip, which is the current group that we're using, and Assort was substantial. I was involved in the entire negotiation process, and I was the one who made the final decision on which vendor we were moving forward with.

### Client
Great. Also congrats. It sounds like a really large operation as well. Maybe going into the story as to what the process looked like. I think it'd be helpful to start off when you started evaluating these platforms and then how you found out about them and where the need started from.

### Expert
I don't know how familiar you are with healthcare operations in general, but all the money that flowed into the hospitals during the pandemic, basically artificially inflated wages across the board. Wages are 60% of a healthcare provider's cost. We don't get any raises. When our prices go up, our expenses go up. We can't raise our price because we're controlled by what insurance companies are willing to negotiate, and they have all the leverage and all the power.

In short, inflation is really, really bad for healthcare. We were looking at any and all opportunities for us to be able to work more efficiently while still maintaining a positive patient experience. A group that is a large GI group that was looking at some of the automations on using AI for billing services. I mean it's a really large GI practice that's not national, but I think they're the top five nationally as far as size goes. I had an executive friend of mine connect me with their president and we were just talking shop and it was primarily discussing the automations on billing and coding.

He mentioned a group that they had moved forward with from a phone system. They had been using a lease AI and so I started off looking at a lease AI. Didn't feel 100% with it just because they weren't from the healthcare sector. That fell off the radar for a little bit because we had other stuff that we were working on. We went to our athenahealth conference and there were two or three different AI phone system providers there.

We started exploring it a little bit more and Assort was the one that I met with at the athenahealth conference and we started having discussions on pricing and everything else, got pricing down pretty good. One of the athenahealth execs had met with Flip AI, which is the current one that we're using, and I just felt better about them and I moved forward with Flip.

### Client
Okay. On that note, maybe just going into more detail as to why you felt better about Flip AI. Is Flip, also hear one clarifying question. Are they healthcare specific or are they agnostic on sectors?

### Expert
They were agnostic for the most part, but they were making a pretty heavy move into the healthcare space. I met their CEO and the team that he had behind him. I gleaned more confidence from that. I'm a gut guy, that's just how I tend to operate. When my gut tells me to go in a specific direction, it's usually right. I felt better about the offering. We were getting more for less and they needed us. When your vendor needs you, it tends to build better functionality because they listen more to your opinion.

### Client
Great. Maybe let's unpack each of those three points that you mentioned. The first one being just general confidence in them, there's an aspect of it that was intuition. Are there any things around the team, their presence, what they said, how they sold you that also led to that, or was it really mostly just an intuition aspect?

### Expert
No, their CEO was highly involved with it on the front end. I mean we run the urgent care user group for athenahealth. When athenahealth rolls out new functionality, in short with athenahealth's EMR, we're one of the go-to urgent care groups for them nationally. Assort did too, but they understood that we have substantial pull within the urgent care environment and we're very profitable for AI phone companies because the call volume is substantial in our business.

As a starting point, most of these AI groups want to get into higher call volume environments. Working with an urgent care group that has 160,000 patient visits a year that's going to end up having good call volume. The CEO was on there. Their sales team seemed very dedicated to what they were doing. Actually, the pricing ended up being about the same, but we were getting more functionality for the price that was agreed to.

### Client
Do you recall what that additional functionality was that you got with Flip versus Assort?

### Expert
The baseline stuff they were talking about with Assort when we were meeting with them was more so just fielding the initial phone call. I didn't feel like we were going to get quite to as much resolution on that versus when we were working with Flip. Obviously, I feel like we had a special opportunity just because of our timing, but also the influence we have in the space. I'm assuming they're not going to do this for everybody, but they did for us.

We basically told them we had helped them build out their urgent care workflow to streamline it and make it function very efficiently. They believed me when I told them we would do that because that's what we do with all of our partners that are patient facing. We try to get in on technologies that we think have promise early so that we recommend functionality that we think is better. I've just found in my career that when you get in early on those technologies that are like that, the other party is more amenable and instead of talking to salespeople, you can talk to the executive side of it.

### Client
When you mentioned that was the third point and we're touching on it now, that it seemed like Flip needed you more. Is that because they had less clients within healthcare already? What else led you to believe that?

### Expert
Yes, I will say Assort fought very hard for our business. I was talking to their CEO, or one of their co-founders. I was talking to an executive level with both groups and frankly, Assort was so persistent that it bothered me a little bit. We literally went through the contractual review process with Assort. I think they have a great product, so I'm not bashing them at all. I just liked the setup of Flip better. It's proven that they've been great to date.

I was talking to my chief administrative officer yesterday and some of the billing calls that they've been able to field and the accuracy in which they've been able to integrate with our EHR and pull correct data out of our system and talk directly to a patient without having to have a human being is super impressive. It's literally fielding a billing call for us now, and it keeps getting better. It's fielding a billing call. It's saying, "Do you have a question about your bill?" "Yes." "Can you provide your statement number?" They provide the statement number. "How can I help you with this?" "Oh, I don't understand why I owe $50."

It literally goes down through copay deductible coinsurance and explains it to the patient. I don't know the exact percentage right now because the billing functionality for us is relatively new. It's resolving and lowering call volume that humans have to take. I've been able to reduce my billing staff count just because I don't need as many people. That's where my main cost drivers is people.

### Client
That's great. Maybe I found that point because I am interested in narrowing down the differences between the two. You mentioned that Assort was primarily for the initial call and then Flip is for more than just that. Do you mind expanding on that as to what you mean?

### Expert
The cost that Assort was wanting to charge for their full level of service was in my industry, in my opinion, for the margins that we have, a significant risk with my lack of familiarity with AI phone systems and my sensitivity towards customer service. I was surprised, there's wanting at least a year contract. I'm committing a certain level of confidence to them that I'm going to spend this much money with you over a year period of time and the full level of functionality. I'm not saying that they can't do what I was just referencing that I feel like they can. If I was going to add all the additional functionality, I would have been having to pay more money.

Overall value with Flip and the team that they had presented, I felt like they were going to do a really good job. They were willing to be more flexible on terms as it relates to not having to make significant long-term commitments. When someone's willing to not make you make a long-term commitment, that usually means that they're pretty confident in their product and their team. We ended up going that direction.

We're not talking about functionality that Assort cannot do. We're talking about I was going to have to pay a lot more money for the additional functionality. I don't know if it's how they do API calls within athenahealth. Athenahealth does charge you for API calls. We probably integrated 14 or 15 different systems with them. They don't charge us, but they charge the vendor for API calls. The way you structured on the front end on making API calls might be part of the cost structure on there. I don't know.

Obviously, I'm not behind the scenes in their business.

### Client
How do these vendors charge you? What's their model? Do they charge you like a per call? How else would they do?

### Expert
It tends to be a per resolved call rate, which in hindsight is a little trickier to do because we're able to track how long they were on the phone, whether or not they hung up, whether or not they were perturbed. I mean there's all kinds of things that you can try to track, but there's certain things that can fall through the cracks on that. It's usually a charge per resolved call.

### Client
Got it. Before Flip, how were you doing this? Did you have a team abroad or you had a domestic team? Did you hire those people yourself or was it outsourced?

### Expert
We don't do anything overseas just because I'm in the Deep South and foreign accents aren't able to be understood well by some Mississippians. We've always had our own internal team to try to answer phone calls. What ends up happening is usually the first touch point would be our front desk personnel. I already mentioned the inflationary stuff in health care and we were needing to reduce headcount.

One of the first places we did that on was reducing the headcount at the front desk, which then made it more challenging for the front desk person because they've got significant call volume coming in. Plus now they're handling the front desk by themselves at most locations, not all locations. I immediately wanted to kick in and make sure that we had something that could field the phone calls and reduce what I call the dumb calls, which is, are you open? What's your address? Where are you located? Which is dumb because it's very easy to look that up online without having to make a phone call.

Now, we have it set up to where if someone calls with the dumb calls, we can offer to text them directions. There's all kinds of things that we can do now that allow us to field a phone call without a person at our front desk having to take the dumb calls.

### Client
Does Flip enable both voice as well as messaging?

### Expert
They do. Frankly, with Flip right now they should give us stock for the stuff that we're teaching them. We've got some really cool functionality that we're trying to add into right now to even be able to insert patient cases within our EHR.

### Client
Insert patient cases, like the information that they tell you over the phone?

### Expert
Yeah. "Hey, Ms. Jones called and she needs a med refill," which we try to get them to do through pharmacies anyway. I'm just giving you a generic example. Our system would know which clinic they were seen at last and would drop that into a nurse bucket to address. We have a secure texting system that we could reach back out to the patient through and avoid having to get on the phone. Anything that we can do that allows us to avoid a phone call is going to be more efficient. Frankly, patients prefer it.

### Client
I was going to say, what have the results been both on an ROI and cost savings as well as on the patient satisfaction side?

### Expert
We track our patient satisfaction pretty closely. I think if you went and looked at our organization, I don't know that we have a clinic that we average less than four and a half stars on. Right out of the gate, because the system has to learn. I can't think of more than a handful of complaints that we got even from the front end. In very recent, I haven't heard a complaint from anybody.

I'm really engaged in our community, so I've got a lot of friends that I know use our clinics. If there were significant problems with it, I would be hearing about it. Now, we're really not having any substantial issues or at least not ticking somebody off enough to where it's getting up to my desk.

### Client
Makes sense. From an ROI cost savings?

### Expert
I don't know, I haven't evaluated it. I can tell you that I know it's saving us money. Just removing the front desk, I think we ended up cutting back a few folks. I think patients would prefer to have calls answered versus just for it to keep ringing. We had about 30% of calls that were going unanswered just because we get a lot of calls and you can only afford so many people to answer the phone.

### Client
Did you let go of people before after you

### Expert
I started looking at the AI phone system stuff, knowing that that's the direction stuff was going. I went ahead and made the cuts before we had implemented it. I made the cuts knowing that there were other technologies that we could leverage to try to help out on the call volume.

### Client
Got it. Your general sense back of the envelope. If you think about how much you paid those people versus how much you're spending on Flip, what do you think the multiple is?

### Expert
I don't know. I could do some quick math for you. This seems high. I don't know for a fact the number of people, so let's just give a range. We probably cut between $500,000 and $750,000 in cost. I'd have to look at what our monthly spend is with Flip. I can tell you that the monthly spend is not egregious or I would be seeing it. I'll have to look at what our monthly spend is. Bills that size don't tend to hit my desk.

### Client
It's maybe somewhere like $50,000-$70,000 annually. Ballpark, it might be around a 10X ROI right now.

### Expert
I would say the range between eight to 12 is probably an accurate range.

### Client
Right. Anything that's not going well.

### Expert
I am assuming you are referring specifically to the AI phone systems.

### Client
Yes, I am.

### Expert
There's a ton of other stuff that doesn't go well. No, not nothing specific to the AI phone system. We have a standing weekly call with them that my COO handles and every now and then I'll join it. They speak periodically, but no exaggeration. Just yesterday, my chief administrative officer, who does a lot of our technical stuff and is involved on the billing side as well, she was bragging like crazy on the level of accuracy in which it was handling billing calls.

I know it's handled quite a few billing calls thus far. She said out of all the audited calls that she listened to, there was only one or two where it did not get resolved appropriately and efficiently. She's very opinionated and she's very detail-oriented. If she's given a platform a compliment, it's more meaningful than the average person giving it a compliment.

### Client
That's great.

### Expert
We've been very pleased and they put a ton of resource in on our system, but they also got to start with a top 100 urgent care group in the country. I feel like we've probably gotten a little bit more attention than average. I would just say in general that I've been highly pleased with the overall performance and frankly, it's exceeded my expectations. I do want to say again though, we did move forward to the contractual phase with Assort.

We even had the agreement negotiate. I just decided not to move forward because I had just a better feeling on Flip. They're an athenahealth marketplace vendor for a reason. By no means do I want to bash them. I just felt like the overall attention and value that we were going to get with our current provider was going to be better.

### Client
If you were forced to switch, let's say Flip, unfortunately, due to uncontrollable circumstances, went out of business tomorrow or alternatively a new competitor came out that was 1/5 of the price of Flip, how hard would that migration process be?

### Expert
Not hard at all. We have got so much data that is recorded now and now we have got experience in the AI phone system space. We would be better at training a new system just because we are familiar with it now. When I tell you we have got an hour standing call every single week. I have got two or three people that are proactively listening to calls to make sure that they are audit. They are just doing an audit. It is not like they are listening to every single call.

Any of the calls that have an appearance of they ended too soon or the system makes it out like, it might not have been a happy engagement for them, we are looking into those and checking them. Now we know where the potential problem areas are on where the system can mess up. That will only improve because we will actually be highly involved with their full on athenahealth integration. They will be leveraging members of our team to make sure that where the integration is pulling data from within our system is being pulled from the correct location. Now, we'll have more knowledge on where the endpoints are.

### Client
On the second point I was talking about, if a new player were to come out in the space, I'm not going to do this, but I'm just curious, how much cheaper would it have to be for you to consider potentially switching? What's the juncture point? Half the cost, 1/5 of the cost, 1/10 of the cost?

### Expert
I would have to look at what the monthly spend is and then it would just be prioritized based off of where other cost structures are and other things and other priorities I'm working on. I try to work on stuff that's saving that's either generating $100,000+ of revenue a year or reducing expense by $50,000 or more a year. There's always areas that are like that that you can focus on in perpetuity. Even if it was $25,000 savings, I would look at it on an annual basis and consider it. You've got the opportunity cost that you're missing by having to implement a new system. It would basically be, "Hey, we need to switch our AI phone systems, but not yet."

It'd be one of those ones that gets dragged out a little bit until larger priorities are addressed. I don't know that 50% is the number, but I would certainly like to see the cost come down on the phone systems and I think the competition entering the market is going to cause that. I think the companies that are being smart about how they integrate with EHRs to minimize their API calls is also going to be smart.

### Client
Great. Thanks so much for all this. Have a good one. Bye.
