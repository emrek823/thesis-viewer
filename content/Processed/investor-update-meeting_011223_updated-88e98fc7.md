## Slide 4: Key Learnings and Wins

# Key Learnings and Wins

**Clinical Hiring**
*   Able to retain all full-time clinical staff and keep them engaged (aside from one case of medical leave)
*   Extensive training of staff at the initial phase of the clinic led to good motivation & instilled core values across clinical team
*   Excellent corporate clinical leadership; enhanced our originally-designed clinical model and provided great support to clinical staff

**Clinical Operations**
*   Successful clinic launch in mid-September with Member #1 initiating treatment same day
*   Member outcomes have far exceeded initial assumptions in terms of engagement, retention, and pace of improvement
*   Continued development of policies, protocols and standard operating procedures for effective clinical management and operations
*   High engagement from members and families, which has led to strong testimonials & high satisfaction (we will start measuring this)
*   Opportunistic engagements with community resources and other behavioral health/SUD players in this space have broadened referral sources and led to strong relationship building for future growth

**BD & Sales**
*   Rapid learning cycles led to developing a health system sales strategy leveraging a professional-services agreement model (employed by One Medical)
*   In-person meetings for sales have felt like a game changer; accelerating buy-in and trust building with stakeholders
*   Developed robust pipeline in 2022 of health systems and payors

## Slide 5: Key Learnings and Wins

# Key Learnings and Wins

**Technology Implementation**
*   We were able to stand up an EHR and MBC system while only leveraging a part-time consultant
*   Starting with a MBC tool alongside EHR has helped establish importance of data-driven practices & decision making

**Internal Team Operations & Hiring**
*   Brought on consultants and advisors that have unlocked significant support across sales and clinical ops
*   Adhered to practice of meeting candidates in-person

**General**
*   Strong press led to outreach from relevant stakeholders, helping get to more health systems / payor conversations and engagement
*   Continued conversations with industry leaders and pulse on the market have led to decision to expand to adolescents in 2023
*   Our story and mission resonate strongly with families and industry players, unlocking unique opportunities and support

AMAE Health
CONFIDENTIAL & PROPRIETARY 5

## Slide 6: Key Learnings and Areas of Improvement

# Key Learnings and Areas of Improvement

**Clinical Hiring**
*   Clinical Ops hire for our stage needed to be in-person and/or have early-stage experience to be able to operate in a chaotic environment and with little oversight
*   Clinical staff overall is too junior to scale up for the type of patients we serve
    *   Intentionally hired team in order to keep costs lower as we were doing this for the first time

**Clinical Operations**
*   Accreditation opens up healthy fee for service channel; to leverage in CA and other states
*   Metrics collection traded hands too often, leading to delays in strategy, collection, and missing data
*   Referral volume from UCLA social workers was lower than expected due to lack of insurance coverage. While having buy-in from health system leadership (many heads in Psych dept) is helpful, their influence does not necessarily trickle down into day-to-day decision making by social workers
*   Expanding referral base to beyond ER and Inpatient Psychiatry, as there are plenty of SMI patients that health systems are looking for support for in other parts of the health system (e.g. primary care)

**BD & Sales**
*   Outcomes were needed to get to the finish line on strategic contracting
*   Initial assumptions & sales story needed iteration
*   Leveraging consultants/advisors with relevant behavioral health experience selling into payors and providers
*   Regulatory medicaid complexity state-by-state; relying on our council (MDW) too heavily and legal answer was often not the right practical answer from contracting and sales standpoint
*   Team and prioritizations within payors are constantly shifting
    *   E.g. IBX was moving towards contracting but then shifted focus solely to insourcing from Magellan. At Beacon, our champion was CMO Dr. Neil Leibowitz, but he got RIF’d.
*   Initial focus on SF proved to not be fruitful given deep resentment of for-profit healthcare providers in the city as well as impassable regulatory hurdles to treating Medi-cal patients in the state
    *   Inspired our health system sales strategy

## Slide 7: Key Learnings and Areas of Improvement

# Key Learnings and Areas of Improvement

**Technology Implementation**
*   More complexity than originally planned with integration / configuration of EHR and measurement-based care (MBC) tools
*   While we haven't made any technical hires, the trade-off to cost-savings has been that we aren't able to fully use technology in the way we would like to

**Internal Team Operations & Hiring**
*   Need for more formalized management principles, culture and values
*   Evolving hiring dynamic; business needs quickly changed and our initial set of hires were not the right fit for an early-stage startup environment. Learned to look for individuals who feel more comfortable in unstructured environments and able to adapt/be creative as real-time business needs arise
*   Scaling will require clearer delineation of roles and responsibilities, and delegation

**General**
*   Costs in certain areas exceeded assumptions including legal in order to start-up the business, but overall spend was below expectation
*   Travel costs increased significantly in 2022; however there is growing need for it in our business
*   Significant time from founding team went to HR-related items and issues on an ongoing basis

“When Amae was recommended to us, we thought we had run out of options. Or at least that none of the other options seemed to offer any real help. Our son, who had been sober and medicated for over a year, was dealing with a new serious mental crisis: for a couple of weeks, he had been super paranoid, agitated and incapable of focusing. Probably because he had stopped taking his meds. He had just been released from a hospital psych ward hold where they heavily sedated him. They had released him with no suggestions on what to do next.

After a few miserable days for all of us, we took him to meet the team at Amae. They were wonderful. A harbor in the storm! They gently convinced him to take a breath and to talk to them. Even though he was very adamant to leave. The psychiatrist offered to take him for a walk, just the two of them, and chat. Everyone there made both him and us feel heard for the first time in weeks. Fast forward, day after day, our son started participating more willingly in Amae’s outpatient program. Now, several months later, he willingly goes there twice a week. He is himself again: caring, calm and attentive. Active socially. He even has started to work again. And he takes his medication. All this seemed out of reach just months ago.

What a turnaround it has been! We are all so grateful for Amae’s very personal approach. They help him with his physical well-being, his mental health, his social skills, and his personal development. I feel that this kind of help is something that was greatly needed and lacking. I really wondered if anyone was listening and really willing to try to help individuals dealing with mental health (rather than just sedating or locking up people who are struggling). I feel like our kids have to live in a very complex and challenging world, with overwhelming global issues that must be really difficult to deal with. It is my opinion that Amae successfully offers a safe space for those who need help learning to cope and move on with their lives.”

"I'm a sister of a member at Amae. I felt immediate relief from the beginning of our first visit to their facility. The staff is incredibly supportive, caring, and immediately follows up when needed. This is unfortunately rare in the mental health field. Though it's only been less than two months since my brother has joined Amae, I've noticed significant improvement in his overall well-being. For the first time, my brother has accepted that he needs help and is willing and eager to continue to do the work at Amae. We're beyond grateful for the staff at Amae, and I'm excited for him to continue to stay on the right path."

“I met with one of your members today. She is still impaired but REMARKABLY better compared to when I last met with her.”

- UCLA Referring Psychiatrist

"The people at Amae are very friendly and supportive. I've learned a lot of new coping skills and ways to control my intrusive thoughts. With the health coach, I've learned about nutritional foods and getting exercise. With the treatment and the medication, I'm getting better.”

## Slide 19: 2023 Roadmap to Series A

# 2023 Roadmap to Series A

Most frequently asked questions from Amae's seed round to prove out

**Can you engage patients and get positive outcomes?**
We have shown that we are able to attract SMI patients, engage them in Amae's treatment model, and dramatically reduce their healthcare costs by improving outcomes.

**Can you execute a contract with a health system or payor?**
In 2022, we met with >30 payors and health systems. There was strong interest in our service, but we received feedback that we needed more data from our LA clinic.

---

**How we will win in 2023**

*   Closing a contract with a health system or payor
*   Growing our LA clinic to fuller capacity
*   Expanding into adolescents in LA
*   Managing a responsible spend
*   Leveraging a primed Series A market for SMI, and have had significant interest from larger Series A investors
*   Continuing to maintain impressive outcomes

*   We have had significant traction and interest with health systems in a short period of time (started outreach in late 2022), but have had contractual challenges as not all health systems are able to engage in a PSA
*   In 2023, we are redirecting our focus to action-oriented health systems with the greatest SMI need and ability to partner

## Slide 22: The opportunity with the adolescent space

# The opportunity with the adolescent space

**Need is rising**
*   UCLA, Cedars, Mt. Sinai and other health system stakeholders voluntarily brought up adolescents’ SMI as their biggest pain point

**Operational adjacencies**
*   Physical separation of dedicated spaces is needed, but all other staff in LA clinic can be shared as in the same building
*   Clinical practices for 16-18 yo. are very similar to adults, we can leverage the existing model

**Current players**
*   Next-gen players in the space focus on low-mid acuity (eg. Brightline, Little Otter) or provide higher acuity but virtual only (Charlie Health) which is not a clinically robust enough modality for many SMI patients

---

**Our next steps**
*   We have secured space in the same building of the LA clinic ($6500 / mo lease for 1yr)
*   All future hires will be done with Adolescents in mind (will prefer providers who can treat minors as well as adults)
*   We will structure the new offering and will take it to market in LA first, then will refine and take it into our standard pitch. This also opens up a new sales channel for payor sales and allows us to iterate on clinical need in a lower risk setting first
