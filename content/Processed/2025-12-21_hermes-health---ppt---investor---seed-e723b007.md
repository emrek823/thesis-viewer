I know how data moves and I know all the players.

- Spearhead record retrieval solutions for life sciences at Datavant (2024).
- Led Datavant's Life Sciences vertical, scaled revenue from inception (2019 to 2024).

# Why Now?

The De-identified and Identified Worlds have Evolved in Isolation — They are now set to Converge.

| De-Identified World                               | Identified World                                      |
|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Built comfort exchanging health data across 1,000+ sources | Largely unaware that health data can be traded or licensed |
| Market is mature; data is commoditized            | Still rely on fax and manual workflows                |
| Growth pressure is creating push for new markets and use cases | Few know how to license or value health data          |
| Hesitate to power identified workflows due to compliance risks | Early APIs from Epic, Athena, Office Ally, Waystar are starting to create data liquidity |
| Limited knowledge of use cases that require identified health data (this was intentional as cultural norm) | However the market lacks technical, operational, and legal knowledge to implement |

# Problem: Identified Data is Stuck in the Past

## Access to Identified Data is Fragmented, Full of Friction, and Labor Intensive

### The Problem

| Patient | CRO | HIEs and TEFCA were designed to enable seamless health data exchange but in practice, it's made it worse. Access to identified data is still full of friction. |
|---------|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Registry | Life Insurance | Health Plan |
| Law Firm | Clinic | Imaging |
| HIE | ROI | EHR |
| Hospital | Claims | EHR |

- **Fragmentation**: 1,000+ data custodians with limited footprint and coverage.
- **Multiple Connections**: Requestors need multiple data sources to meet their needs.
- **Friction**: Labor cost of $100 to pull one medical record.
- **Confusion**: Varying channels to get medical records (fax, bespoke requestor portals, and limited APIs).

# Solution: One Network. One API. One Workflow.

Identified Data needs a Trusted Network that Reduces Friction, Turnaround Times, and Enforces Rules.

# Network Effect &#x26; Value

Hermes Provides Value to Both the Requestor and the Custodian – Creating a Reinforcing Flywheel effect.

| Requestor                          | Custodian                          |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Faster Turnaround: More Revenue** | **More Demand: More Revenue**      |
| Data comes back in minutes instead of weeks | Hermes reduces the friction to request and deliver data; inducing demand for the Custodian’s data. |
| **More Data: More Revenue**        |                                    |
| More data enables Requestors to unlock new markets and use cases. |                                    |
| **Less Overhead: Less Cost**       |                                    |
| One API to submit and retrieve identified health data no more bespoke connections, integrations, and maintenance. |                                    |
| **Implementation Burden: Less Cost** | Hermes handles integrations with Requestors so Custodians don’t have to manage one-off tech implementations and maintenance. |
| **Scalable Intake: Less Cost**     | Requests arrive in a single, standardized format. Unlocking lower operational cost, faster routing, and simplified scaling. |

# MOAT

**Hermes Health’s Moat = Network Density × Neutrality × Economies of Scale × Product Velocity**

| **Connection Density** | More Custodian connections mean fewer reasons for Requestors to build their own. Each link strengthens the network. |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| **Neutrality**         | We don’t compete with Custodians or our Requestors—our neutrality builds trust and drives adoption.                  |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| **Economies of Scale** | More volume allows us to negotiate lower Custodian costs, enabling us to pass these savings to our Requestors.        |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| **Product Velocity**   | Our workflow innovations make data exchange seamless for Custodians and Requestors. This speed lets us outperform networks of similar size with slower product cycles. |

# Partners Can’t Be The Center

## Why Can’t Partners Be The Center

- **Competitive Conflict:** Partners compete with each other, making it difficult for any single partner to act as a neutral hub for all.

- **Limited Footprint:** Individual partners have a limited footprint on a patient data record. As a result, they cannot fulfill all requests.

- **Trust:** Partners don’t trust each other and as a result hesitate to share proprietary information directly with each other, restricting cooperation.

- **Complex Integration:** Direct connections among multiple partners create costly complexity, duplication, and labor.
