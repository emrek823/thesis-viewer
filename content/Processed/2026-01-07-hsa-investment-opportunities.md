# HSA Is a $159B Market at an Inflection Point—But Pure-Play Window Is Closing

The HSA market is massive ($159B, 16% YoY growth) with strong regulatory tailwinds (OBBBA adds 7.3M newly eligible). However, **HealthEquity and the Big 4 control 2/3 of assets**, and pure-play HSA fintech has failed to produce breakout winners. The real opportunities are:

1. **ICHRA-first platforms** (Thatch model: $38M Series A, a16z-backed)
2. **LMN-based spend expansion** (TrueMed: $34M Series A, 3x YoY growth)
3. **Niche arbitrage plays** (food-as-medicine, GLP-1 companions)
4. **AI-native HSA** (Saga Health inbound—worth evaluating)

## Competitive Landscape

### Incumbent Structure (Market Concentration Problem)

| Provider | Position | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| **Fidelity** | #1 by market share (24%) | Captured ~50% of recent industry growth |
| **HealthEquity** | #1 by assets ($22B+) | Consolidator (acquired WageWorks $2B) |
| **Optum** | #3 | Part of UHG; Betterment partnership for robo-advisory |
| **HSA Bank** | #4 | Webster Bank owned |

**Big 4 control ~65% of market.** Traditional banks have largely stayed out due to technology gaps and employer distribution challenges.

### Pure-Play HSA Fintech (Window Closing)
- **$120M+ deployed** into HSA startups
- Only **Lively** discloses meaningful traction ($200M AUM)
- **No clear path to $100M+ ARR** as standalone HSA
- **HealthEquity will acquire winners**
- Source: [[2026-01-06-hsa-fsa-employer-market-validation.md]]:83, 103, 122, 126, 164

### ICHRA Platforms (The Real Opportunity)

| Company | Funding | Positioning |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Thatch** | $38M Series A (a16z, GC) | ICHRA + HSA + just-in-time funding; filed patent on dynamic HSA funding |
| **Take Command** | First-to-market (2014) | Advised on ICHRA legislation; Dallas-based |
| **Venteur** | VC-backed | AI decision support trained on 30 years claims data |
| **Remodel Health** | — | Full-service ICHRA administration |

## Emerging Business Models

### 1. LMN-Based Spend Expansion (TrueMed Model)

**Mechanism:** Issue Letters of Medical Necessity via telehealth to unlock HSA/FSA for wellness purchases traditionally ineligible.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Funding | $34M Series A (Dec 2025), a16z + Bessemer |
| Merchants | 3,000+ (Peloton, Eight Sleep, Nike Strength, Oura) |
| Revenue growth | 3x YoY for 2 consecutive years |
| Consumer savings | ~30% via pre-tax dollars |

**Competitors:**
- **Flex** ($15M Series A): Merchant-side payments (Therabody, NordicTrack)
- **Starship**: HSA spend/save/invest platform
- **Aya**: HSA/WSA Visa card for employees

### 2. AI-Native HSA Platform (Saga Health)

**Status:** Inbound deal, emailed Jan 1, 2026. Deck captured.
**Pitch:** AI-powered HSA covering spending, saving, investing, lending in unified experience.
**Action:** Evaluate against Thatch/TrueMed positioning.

Source: [[2026-01-05]]:13

### 3. Just-in-Time HSA Funding (Thatch Innovation)

**Problem:** HSAs are painful because nobody knows how much they'll spend in a year.
**Solution:** Fund HSA purchases just-in-time so employees spend tax-free without estimating expenses.
**Moat:** Provisional patent filed.

Source: [[gc-thatch-memo-2-3130da7e.md]]:41

### 4. GLP-1 + HSA Companion Stack

**Thesis:** GLP-1 prescriptions (1 in 8 US adults) create medical necessity documentation for companion products.

**HSA-Eligible via LMN:**
- Protein supplements
- Gym memberships
- Body composition tracking
- Nutrition counseling

**Model:** Bundle GLP-1 prescription (via telehealth) + HSA-funded companion products.

### 5. Food-as-Medicine HSA (Holy Grail)

**Opportunity:** Medical nutrition therapy and therapeutic food delivery represent highest-TAM expansion if IRS eligibility can be cracked via LMN strategy.

**Why it matters:** Everyone buys food. If food becomes HSA-eligible, TAM explodes.

**Analogues:** Mom's Meals (Medicaid) could pivot to HSA.

### 6. Unified Wellness Wallet

**Problem:** Fragmentation across HSA, FSA, LSA, Commuter, Dependent Care FSA.

**Solution:** Unified platform that:
- Aggregates all benefit accounts
- Auto-routes purchases to optimal tax-advantaged account
- Generates LMNs dynamically for borderline purchases

## Investment Thesis Framework

### Where to Play

| Opportunity | Stage | Risk | Upside |
|-------------|-------|------|--------|
| **ICHRA platforms** | Series A-B | Execution, incumbents | Large (ICHRA at inflection) |
| **LMN spend expansion** | Series A | Regulatory, IRS enforcement | Large (TrueMed proving model) |
| **AI-native HSA** | Seed-A | Market timing, differentiation | Medium-High |
| **Food-as-medicine HSA** | Seed | High regulatory risk | Massive if it works |
| **Pure-play HSA** | Mature | HealthEquity consolidation | Low (window closed) |

### What Makes This Investable Now

1. **OBBBA adds 7.3M eligible** (Jan 2026)—demand inflection
2. **ACA subsidy cliff** (Jan 2026)—22M seeking alternatives
3. **ICHRA adoption 29% YoY**—employer demand proven
4. **TrueMed $34M Series A**—LMN model validated by a16z
5. **67% user dissatisfaction**—UX opportunity persists

### What Could Go Wrong

1. **IRS cracks down on LMN arbitrage**—TrueMed/Flex business model risk
2. **HealthEquity acquires winners**—exits capped
3. **ICHRA complexity limits adoption**—employer resistance
4. **Bronze plan HSA-compatibility gets reversed**—regulatory risk

---

## Recommendations

1. **Take Saga Health call** — AI-native HSA positioning is timely; compare to Thatch's just-in-time funding innovation.

2. **Track ICHRA platforms** — Thatch ($38M a16z), Venteur, Take Command are the leaders. Consider if any are fundable or if market is already crowded.

3. **Monitor TrueMed imitators** — LMN model is proven; Flex at $15M Series A is the main competitor. Look for vertical-specific plays (food, GLP-1 companions).

4. **Pass on pure-play HSA** — HealthEquity consolidation means exits are capped. Lively is the only scaled player and likely acquisition target.

5. **Watch for food-as-medicine HSA** — Highest TAM opportunity but requires regulatory breakthrough. Could emerge from Mom's Meals pivot or new startup.

**Bull case:** ICHRA + Bronze plan eligibility creates 15M+ new HSA users by 2028; platforms that nail UX capture disproportionate share.

**Bear case:** IRS clamps down on LMN arbitrage; HealthEquity acquires best platforms at modest multiples; pure-play HSA remains a features business.
