### Product Strategy & 2026 Vision

- Core 2026 goal: dominate clinical-stage biotech manufacturing intelligence
	- Replace SharePoint-based batch review with ETRI platform
	- Position as go-to solution for Chief Technical Operations Officers
	- Target innovative clinical biopharma companies working with CDMOs
- CDMO angle: build agentic infrastructure on top of legacy systems
	- Enable AI applications over existing systems of record
	- Position ETRI team as infrastructure builders
- Success metric: proven foundation enables expansion to larger pharma and commercial manufacturing

### Market Thesis & Earned Insights

- Core thesis: decentralized manufacturing becoming increasingly specialized
	- Historical: single company could handle full drug manufacturing
	- Current trend: fragmented constellation of specialized partners
	- Drug complexity driving supplier/manufacturer specialization
- Manufacturing fragmentation examples:
	- Drug substance vs drug product split (API synthesis + formulation)
	- Biologics: protein manufacturing + vial filling by different companies
- Platform vision: navigate entire manufacturing constellation from laptop
	- Process recommendations and parameters
	- CDMO partner matching (marketplace dynamic)
	- Tech transfer and scale-up control

### Product Architecture Considerations

- Platform vs applications framework: jobs-to-be-done approach
- Key question: synergistic platform vs independent business lines
- Product categories assessed:
- Clean break between process optimization and post-manufacturing tools
- Focus on documented operation-by-operation results in paper records

### Team & Conference Updates

- Recent hires (Sam and Zach) performing well in Nomad office
- Strong ownership mentality and self-starter approach
- Domain expertise building priority:
	- Sam: drug discovery background, learning bio-process manufacturing
	- Zach: fintech background, learning clinical trial fundamentals
- Conference success: AI in drug development panel exceeded expectations
	- Strengthened consulting agency partnership
	- Generated high-quality leads across biotech and CDMO segments

### Next Steps

- January 8th follow-up call (pre-JPM)
- Quinn to send pre-read memo with formalized thoughts
- Skip JPM attendance (not ROI-positive at current stage)

### Fund Structure Developments

- Active conversations on three potential paths for 2025:
- Evan McQueen leading parallel fund interest
	- Led investments from Ninja Fund 1 & 2 into Virtue
	- 2-hour virtual meeting last week
	- Verbal commitment for $20-30M (likely $20-25M)
	- Currently doing reference calls with 20+ founders
	- Speaking with fund head Thursday
- Parallel fund structure would increase total to $75M
	- Same investment strategy
	- Additional $500K-1M+ per check
	- Founders/VCs see no difference operationally

### Valuation Testing & Audit Preparation

- Portfolio company data collection in progress
	- Reached out to all 9 companies for financials confirmation
	- Lightspan financials coming after Dec 15th
	- Board materials being shared for missing data
- September/October board deck sent for Lightspan (lacks convertible note details)
- Process: forward data to auditors once collected

### Cash Management

- December distribution: $25K approved immediately
	- Potential additional $25K next week pending cash review
	- Monthly $30-40K payment due Jan 1st
- DS to initiate SVB wire transfer (standard process)

### Tax Coordination

- Emre needs consultation on taxable gains situation
- DS to connect with Emre this week for clarity

### Pipeline Status

- No immediate opportunities to report
- Focus shifted to New Year pipeline building
- Working on deal flow development

	- Biologics: protein manufacturing + vial filling by different companies
- Platform vision: navigate entire manufacturing constellation from laptop
	- Process recommendations and parameters
	- CDMO partner matching (marketplace dynamic)
	- Tech transfer and scale-up control

### Product Architecture Considerations

- Platform vs applications framework: jobs-to-be-done approach
- Key question: synergistic platform vs independent business lines
- Product categories assessed:
- Clean break between process optimization and post-manufacturing tools
- Focus on documented operation-by-operation results in paper records

### Team & Conference Updates

- Recent hires (Sam and Zach) performing well in Nomad office
- Strong ownership mentality and self-starter approach
- Domain expertise building priority:
	- Sam: drug discovery background, learning bio-process manufacturing
	- Zach: fintech background, learning clinical trial fundamentals
- Conference success: AI in drug development panel exceeded expectations
	- Strengthened consulting agency partnership
	- Generated high-quality leads across biotech and CDMO segments

### Next Steps

- January 8th follow-up call (pre-JPM)
- Quinn to send pre-read memo with formalized thoughts
- Skip JPM attendance (not ROI-positive at current stage)

### Fund Structure Developments

- Active conversations on three potential paths for 2025:
- Evan McQueen leading parallel fund interest
	- Led investments from Ninja Fund 1 & 2 into Virtue
	- 2-hour virtual meeting last week
	- Verbal commitment for $20-30M (likely $20-25M)
	- Currently doing reference calls with 20+ founders
	- Speaking with fund head Thursday
- Parallel fund structure would increase total to $75M
	- Same investment strategy
	- Additional $500K-1M+ per check
	- Founders/VCs see no difference operationally

### Valuation Testing & Audit Preparation

- Portfolio company data collection in progress
	- Reached out to all 9 companies for financials confirmation
	- Lightspan financials coming after Dec 15th
	- Board materials being shared for missing data
- September/October board deck sent for Lightspan (lacks convertible note details)
- Process: forward data to auditors once collected

### Cash Management

- December distribution: $25K approved immediately
	- Potential additional $25K next week pending cash review
	- Monthly $30-40K payment due Jan 1st
- DS to initiate SVB wire transfer (standard process)

### Tax Coordination

- Emre needs consultation on taxable gains situation
- DS to connect with Emre this week for clarity

### Pipeline Status

- No immediate opportunities to report
- Focus shifted to New Year pipeline building
- Working on deal flow development

### Product Strategy & 2026 Vision

- Core 2026 goal: dominate clinical-stage biotech manufacturing intelligence
	- Replace SharePoint-based batch review with ETRI platform
	- Position as go-to solution for Chief Technical Operations Officers
	- Target innovative clinical biopharma companies working with CDMOs
- CDMO angle: build agentic infrastructure on top of legacy systems
	- Enable AI applications over existing systems of record
	- Position ETRI team as infrastructure builders
- Success metric: proven foundation enables expansion to larger pharma and commercial manufacturing

### Market Thesis & Earned Insights

- Core thesis: decentralized manufacturing becoming increasingly specialized
	- Historical: single company could handle full drug manufacturing
	- Current trend: fragmented constellation of specialized partners
	- Drug complexity driving supplier/manufacturer specialization
- Manufacturing fragmentation examples:
	- Drug substance vs drug product split (API synthesis + formulation)
	- Biologics: protein manufacturing + vial filling by different companies
- Platform vision: navigate entire manufacturing constellation from laptop
	- Process recommendations and parameters
	- CDMO partner matching (marketplace dynamic)

### Fund Structure Developments

- Active conversations on three potential paths for 2025:
- Evan McQueen leading parallel fund interest
	- Led investments from Ninja Fund 1 & 2 into Virtue
	- 2-hour virtual meeting last week
	- Verbal commitment for $20-30M (likely $20-25M)
	- Currently doing reference calls with 20+ founders
	- Speaking with fund head Thursday
- Parallel fund structure would increase total to $75M
	- Same investment strategy
	- Additional $500K-1M+ per check
	- Founders/VCs see no difference operationally

### Valuation Testing & Audit Preparation

- Portfolio company data collection in progress
	- Reached out to all 9 companies for financials confirmation
	- Lightspan financials coming after Dec 15th
	- Board materials being shared for missing data
- September/October board deck sent for Lightspan (lacks convertible note details)
- Process: forward data to auditors once collected

### Cash Management

- December distribution: $25K approved immediately
	- Potential additional $25K next week pending cash review
	- Monthly $30-40K payment due Jan 1st
- DS to initiate SVB wire transfer (standard process)

### Tax Coordination

- Emre needs consultation on taxable gains situation
- DS to connect with Emre this week for clarity

### Pipeline Status

- No immediate opportunities to report
- Focus shifted to New Year pipeline building
- Working on deal flow development

### Deal Updates & Current Status

- GPB negotiation ongoing
	- Andrew backtracking on previously agreed branded terms

### Product Strategy & 2026 Vision

- Core 2026 goal: dominate clinical-stage biotech manufacturing intelligence
	- Replace SharePoint-based batch review with ETRI platform
	- Position as go-to solution for Chief Technical Operations Officers
	- Target innovative clinical biopharma companies working with CDMOs
- CDMO angle: build agentic infrastructure on top of legacy systems
	- Enable AI applications over existing systems of record
	- Position ETRI team as infrastructure builders
- Success metric: proven foundation enables expansion to larger pharma and commercial manufacturing

### Market Thesis & Earned Insights

- Core thesis: decentralized manufacturing becoming increasingly specialized
	- Historical: single company could handle full drug manufacturing
	- Current trend: fragmented constellation of specialized partners
	- Drug complexity driving supplier/manufacturer specialization
- Manufacturing fragmentation examples:
	- Drug substance vs drug product split (API synthesis + formulation)
	- Biologics: protein manufacturing + vial filling by different companies
- Platform vision: navigate entire manufacturing constellation from laptop
	- Process recommendations and parameters
	- CDMO partner matching (marketplace dynamic)
	- Tech transfer and scale-up control

### Product Architecture Considerations

- Platform vs applications framework: jobs-to-be-done approach
- Key question: synergistic platform vs independent business lines
- Product categories assessed:
- Clean break between process optimization and post-manufacturing tools
- Focus on documented operation-by-operation results in paper records

### Team & Conference Updates

- Recent hires (Sam and Zach) performing well in Nomad office
- Strong ownership mentality and self-starter approach
- Domain expertise building priority:
	- Sam: drug discovery background, learning bio-process manufacturing
	- Zach: fintech background, learning clinical trial fundamentals
- Conference success: AI in drug development panel exceeded expectations
	- Strengthened consulting agency partnership
	- Generated high-quality leads across biotech and CDMO segments

### Next Steps

- January 8th follow-up call (pre-JPM)
- Quinn to send pre-read memo with formalized thoughts
- Skip JPM attendance (not ROI-positive at current stage)

### Product Strategy & 2026 Vision

- Core 2026 goal: dominate clinical-stage biotech manufacturing intelligence
	- Replace SharePoint-based batch review with ETRI platform
	- Position as go-to solution for Chief Technical Operations Officers
	- Target innovative clinical biopharma companies working with CDMOs
- CDMO angle: build agentic infrastructure on top of legacy systems
	- Enable AI applications over existing systems of record
	- Position ETRI team as infrastructure builders
- Success metric: proven foundation enables expansion to larger pharma and commercial manufacturing

### Market Thesis & Earned Insights

- Core thesis: decentralized manufacturing becoming increasingly specialized
	- Historical: single company could handle full drug manufacturing
	- Current trend: fragmented constellation of specialized partners
	- Drug complexity driving supplier/manufacturer specialization
- Manufacturing fragmentation examples:
	- Drug substance vs drug product split (API synthesis + formulation)
	- Biologics: protein manufacturing + vial filling by different companies
- Platform vision: navigate entire manufacturing constellation from laptop
	- Process recommendations and parameters
	- CDMO partner matching (marketplace dynamic)
	- Tech transfer and scale-up control

### Product Architecture Considerations

- Platform vs applications framework: jobs-to-be-done approach
- Key question: synergistic platform vs independent business lines
- Product categories assessed:
- Clean break between process optimization and post-manufacturing tools
- Focus on documented operation-by-operation results in paper records

### Team & Conference Updates

- Recent hires (Sam and Zach) performing well in Nomad office
- Strong ownership mentality and self-starter approach
- Domain expertise building priority:
	- Sam: drug discovery background, learning bio-process manufacturing
	- Zach: fintech background, learning clinical trial fundamentals
- Conference success: AI in drug development panel exceeded expectations
	- Strengthened consulting agency partnership
	- Generated high-quality leads across biotech and CDMO segments

### Next Steps

- January 8th follow-up call (pre-JPM)
- Quinn to send pre-read memo with formalized thoughts
- Skip JPM attendance (not ROI-positive at current stage)

### Product Strategy & 2026 Vision

- Core 2026 goal: dominate clinical-stage biotech manufacturing intelligence
	- Replace SharePoint-based batch review with ETRI platform
	- Position as go-to solution for Chief Technical Operations Officers
	- Target innovative clinical biopharma companies working with CDMOs
- CDMO angle: build agentic infrastructure on top of legacy systems
	- Enable AI applications over existing systems of record
	- Position ETRI team as infrastructure builders
- Success metric: proven foundation enables expansion to larger pharma and commercial manufacturing

### Market Thesis & Earned Insights

- Core thesis: decentralized manufacturing becoming increasingly specialized
	- Historical: single company could handle full drug manufacturing
	- Current trend: fragmented constellation of specialized partners
	- Drug complexity driving supplier/manufacturer specialization
- Manufacturing fragmentation examples:
	- Drug substance vs drug product split (API synthesis + formulation)
	- Biologics: protein manufacturing + vial filling by different companies
- Platform vision: navigate entire manufacturing constellation from laptop
	- Process recommendations and parameters
	- CDMO partner matching (marketplace dynamic)
	- Tech transfer and scale-up control

### Product Architecture Considerations

- Platform vs applications framework: jobs-to-be-done approach
- Key question: synergistic platform vs independent business lines
- Product categories assessed:
- Clean break between process optimization and post-manufacturing tools
- Focus on documented operation-by-operation results in paper records

### Team & Conference Updates

- Recent hires (Sam and Zach) performing well in Nomad office
- Strong ownership mentality and self-starter approach
- Domain expertise building priority:
	- Sam: drug discovery background, learning bio-process manufacturing
	- Zach: fintech background, learning clinical trial fundamentals
- Conference success: AI in drug development panel exceeded expectations
	- Strengthened consulting agency partnership
	- Generated high-quality leads across biotech and CDMO segments

### Next Steps

- January 8th follow-up call (pre-JPM)
- Quinn to send pre-read memo with formalized thoughts
- Skip JPM attendance (not ROI-positive at current stage)

### Fund Structure Developments

- Active conversations on three potential paths for 2025:
- Evan McQueen leading parallel fund interest
	- Led investments from Ninja Fund 1 & 2 into Virtue
	- 2-hour virtual meeting last week
	- Verbal commitment for $20-30M (likely $20-25M)
	- Currently doing reference calls with 20+ founders
	- Speaking with fund head Thursday
- Parallel fund structure would increase total to $75M
	- Same investment strategy
	- Additional $500K-1M+ per check
	- Founders/VCs see no difference operationally

### Valuation Testing & Audit Preparation

- Portfolio company data collection in progress
	- Reached out to all 9 companies for financials confirmation
	- Lightspan financials coming after Dec 15th
	- Board materials being shared for missing data
- September/October board deck sent for Lightspan (lacks convertible note details)
- Process: forward data to auditors once collected

### Cash Management

- December distribution: $25K approved immediately
	- Potential additional $25K next week pending cash review
	- Monthly $30-40K payment due Jan 1st
- DS to initiate SVB wire transfer (standard process)

### Tax Coordination

- Emre needs consultation on taxable gains situation
- DS to connect with Emre this week for clarity

### Pipeline Status

- No immediate opportunities to report
- Focus shifted to New Year pipeline building
- Working on deal flow development

**Updated:** 2025-12-15T20:36:37.427Z

### Product Strategy & 2026 Vision

- Core 2026 goal: dominate clinical-stage biotech manufacturing intelligence
	- Replace SharePoint-based batch review with ETRI platform
	- Position as go-to solution for Chief Technical Operations Officers
	- Target innovative clinical biopharma companies working with CDMOs
- CDMO angle: build agentic infrastructure on top of legacy systems
	- Enable AI applications over existing systems of record
	- Position ETRI team as infrastructure builders
- Success metric: proven foundation enables expansion to larger pharma and commercial manufacturing

### Market Thesis & Earned Insights

- Core thesis: decentralized manufacturing becoming increasingly specialized
	- Historical: single company could handle full drug manufacturing
	- Current trend: fragmented constellation of specialized partners
	- Drug complexity driving supplier/manufacturer specialization
- Manufacturing fragmentation examples:
	- Drug substance vs drug product split (API synthesis + formulation)
	- Biologics: protein manufacturing + vial filling by different companies
- Platform vision: navigate entire manufacturing constellation from laptop
	- Process recommendations and parameters
	- CDMO partner matching (marketplace dynamic)
	- Tech transfer and scale-up control

### Product Architecture Considerations

- Platform vs applications framework: jobs-to-be-done approach
- Key question: synergistic platform vs independent business lines
- Product categories assessed:
- Clean break between process optimization and post-manufacturing tools
- Focus on documented operation-by-operation results in paper records

### Team & Conference Updates

- Recent hires (Sam and Zach) performing well in Nomad office
- Strong ownership mentality and self-starter approach
- Domain expertise building priority:
	- Sam: drug discovery background, learning bio-process manufacturing
	- Zach: fintech background, learning clinical trial fundamentals
- Conference success: AI in drug development panel exceeded expectations
	- Strengthened consulting agency partnership
	- Generated high-quality leads across biotech and CDMO segments

### Next Steps

- January 8th follow-up call (pre-JPM)
- Quinn to send pre-read memo with formalized thoughts
- Skip JPM attendance (not ROI-positive at current stage)

### Fund Structure Developments

- Active conversations on three potential paths for 2025:
- Evan McQueen leading parallel fund interest
	- Led investments from Ninja Fund 1 & 2 into Virtue
	- 2-hour virtual meeting last week
	- Verbal commitment for $20-30M (likely $20-25M)
	- Currently doing reference calls with 20+ founders
	- Speaking with fund head Thursday
- Parallel fund structure would increase total to $75M
	- Same investment strategy
	- Additional $500K-1M+ per check
	- Founders/VCs see no difference operationally

### Valuation Testing & Audit Preparation

- Portfolio company data collection in progress
	- Reached out to all 9 companies for financials confirmation
	- Lightspan financials coming after Dec 15th
	- Board materials being shared for missing data
- September/October board deck sent for Lightspan (lacks convertible note details)
- Process: forward data to auditors once collected

### Cash Management

- December distribution: $25K approved immediately
	- Potential additional $25K next week pending cash review
	- Monthly $30-40K payment due Jan 1st
- DS to initiate SVB wire transfer (standard process)

### Tax Coordination

- Emre needs consultation on taxable gains situation
- DS to connect with Emre this week for clarity

### Pipeline Status

- No immediate opportunities to report
- Focus shifted to New Year pipeline building
- Working on deal flow development

### Product Strategy & 2026 Vision

- Core 2026 goal: dominate clinical-stage biotech manufacturing intelligence
	- Replace SharePoint-based batch review with ETRI platform
	- Position as go-to solution for Chief Technical Operations Officers
	- Target innovative clinical biopharma companies working with CDMOs
- CDMO angle: build agentic infrastructure on top of legacy systems
	- Enable AI applications over existing systems of record
	- Position ETRI team as infrastructure builders
- Success metric: proven foundation enables expansion to larger pharma and commercial manufacturing

### Market Thesis & Earned Insights

- Core thesis: decentralized manufacturing becoming increasingly specialized
	- Historical: single company could handle full drug manufacturing
	- Current trend: fragmented constellation of specialized partners
	- Drug complexity driving supplier/manufacturer specialization
- Manufacturing fragmentation examples:
	- Drug substance vs drug product split (API synthesis + formulation)
	- Biologics: protein manufacturing + vial filling by different companies
- Platform vision: navigate entire manufacturing constellation from laptop
	- Process recommendations and parameters
	- CDMO partner matching (marketplace dynamic)
	- Tech transfer and scale-up control

### Product Architecture Considerations

- Platform vs applications framework: jobs-to-be-done approach
- Key question: synergistic platform vs independent business lines
- Product categories assessed:
- Clean break between process optimization and post-manufacturing tools
- Focus on documented operation-by-operation results in paper records

### Team & Conference Updates

- Recent hires (Sam and Zach) performing well in Nomad office
- Strong ownership mentality and self-starter approach
- Domain expertise building priority:
	- Sam: drug discovery background, learning bio-process manufacturing
	- Zach: fintech background, learning clinical trial fundamentals
- Conference success: AI in drug development panel exceeded expectations
	- Strengthened consulting agency partnership
	- Generated high-quality leads across biotech and CDMO segments

### Next Steps

- January 8th follow-up call (pre-JPM)
- Quinn to send pre-read memo with formalized thoughts
- Skip JPM attendance (not ROI-positive at current stage)

### Fund Structure Developments

- Active conversations on three potential paths for 2025:
- Evan McQueen leading parallel fund interest
	- Led investments from Ninja Fund 1 & 2 into Virtue
	- 2-hour virtual meeting last week
	- Verbal commitment for $20-30M (likely $20-25M)
	- Currently doing reference calls with 20+ founders
	- Speaking with fund head Thursday
- Parallel fund structure would increase total to $75M
	- Same investment strategy
	- Additional $500K-1M+ per check
	- Founders/VCs see no difference operationally

### Valuation Testing & Audit Preparation

- Portfolio company data collection in progress
	- Reached out to all 9 companies for financials confirmation
	- Lightspan financials coming after Dec 15th
	- Board materials being shared for missing data
- September/October board deck sent for Lightspan (lacks convertible note details)
- Process: forward data to auditors once collected

### Cash Management

- December distribution: $25K approved immediately
	- Potential additional $25K next week pending cash review
	- Monthly $30-40K payment due Jan 1st
- DS to initiate SVB wire transfer (standard process)

### Tax Coordination

- Emre needs consultation on taxable gains situation
- DS to connect with Emre this week for clarity

### Pipeline Status

- No immediate opportunities to report
- Focus shifted to New Year pipeline building
- Working on deal flow development

	- Replace SharePoint-based batch review with ETRI platform
	- Position as go-to solution for Chief Technical Operations Officers
	- Target innovative clinical biopharma companies working with CDMOs
- CDMO angle: build agentic infrastructure on top of legacy systems
	- Enable AI applications over existing systems of record
	- Position ETRI team as infrastructure builders
- Success metric: proven foundation enables expansion to larger pharma and commercial manufacturing

### Market Thesis & Earned Insights

- Core thesis: decentralized manufacturing becoming increasingly specialized
	- Historical: single company could handle full drug manufacturing
	- Current trend: fragmented constellation of specialized partners
	- Drug complexity driving supplier/manufacturer specialization
- Manufacturing fragmentation examples:
	- Drug substance vs drug product split (API synthesis + formulation)
	- Biologics: protein manufacturing + vial filling by different companies
- Platform vision: navigate entire manufacturing constellation from laptop
	- Process recommendations and parameters
	- CDMO partner matching (marketplace dynamic)
	- Tech transfer and scale-up control

### Product Architecture Considerations

- Platform vs applications framework: jobs-to-be-done approach
- Key question: synergistic platform vs independent business lines
- Product categories assessed:
- Clean break between process optimization and post-manufacturing tools
- Focus on documented operation-by-operation results in paper records

### Team & Conference Updates

- Recent hires (Sam and Zach) performing well in Nomad office
- Strong ownership mentality and self-starter approach
- Domain expertise building priority:
	- Sam: drug discovery background, learning bio-process manufacturing
	- Zach: fintech background, learning clinical trial fundamentals
- Conference success: AI in drug development panel exceeded expectations
	- Strengthened consulting agency partnership
	- Generated high-quality leads across biotech and CDMO segments

### Next Steps

- January 8th follow-up call (pre-JPM)
- Quinn to send pre-read memo with formalized thoughts
- Skip JPM attendance (not ROI-positive at current stage)
