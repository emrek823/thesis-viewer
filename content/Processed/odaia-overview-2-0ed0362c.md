Who is ODAIA?
ODAIA originated from the collaborative academic work between the University of Toronto and the University of Lausanne, spinning out as ODAIA in November 2018.

We combine process mining with artificial intelligence to predict customer & patient journeys and redefine the future of work for pharmaceutical commercial teams.

$13.8M USD raised in an over-subscribed Series A in January of 2022. Since then, we have doubled in workforce size leading to 10 new brands onboarded in 2022 and increasing our ARR by 8x compared to EOY 2021.

## Slide 25: HCP PowerScore goes Beyond Rx...

HCP PowerScore goes Beyond Rx...

The MAPTUAL PowerScore represents the propensity of an HCP to deliver to the brand's objective and is driven by modular pieces embedded with advanced scalable ML models
1.  Dynamically scales relative to the view: national, state, regional, rep territory; relative to HCPs in that geo segment
2.  Continuously learns through feedback-loops

*(Image shows a UI snippet of an HCP's profile with a "9" PowerScore and the details of a planned interaction.)*

**9 Scoring Algorithm**
MAPTUAL's scoring algorithm dynamically applies different weights to each input module to deliver the PowerScore

**Modules contributing to PowerScore:**
*   AI - Multi-channel Attribution
*   AI - Numerical Predictions (Rx Volume, Rx Share, Active Patients)
*   AI - Microsegments (Predictive Segments, Look-alike Segments)
*   Historical Microsegments
*   Demographic & Socio-Economic Population Trends
*   Qualitative Segments (KOLs, Same Hospital, Same school, Retirement, and more...)
*   Business Scenario Based Objectives

*   **Volume Prediction Accuracy - Summary Analysis**
    The number of Entities (Regions or HCPs) within each grade are shown below

    **NBRx Grade A** *(Bar chart indicates Grade A has the highest count)*
    **NBRx Grade B** *(Bar chart indicates Grade B has a lower count than A)*
    **NBRx Grade C** *(Bar chart indicates Grade C has the lowest count)*

    **Table: Objective 1**
