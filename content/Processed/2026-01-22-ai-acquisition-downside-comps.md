# AI Acquisition Comps for Downside Scenarios: What's the Floor?

**The take:** For AI companies with unique data, team, or architecture moats, the acquisition floor ranges from **$30M (fire sale) to $650M (talent extraction)**, depending on what the acquirer wants. The key variable isn't revenue—it's whether you have something Big Tech needs. If you do, expect **1.0-1.5x last round** in a distressed scenario. If not, expect **cents on the dollar or zero.**

The "license + acqui-hire" deal structure has emerged as the dominant pattern for AI acquisitions in 2024-2025, specifically designed to avoid antitrust scrutiny while extracting value.

---

## Tier 1: License + Acqui-Hire (Strategic Extraction)

These deals occur when Big Tech wants specific people or IP but doesn't want regulatory scrutiny.

| Deal | Value | Structure | Investor Return | Key Lesson |
|------|-------|-----------|-----------------|------------|
| **Inflection → Microsoft** (Mar 2024) | $650M+ | $620M license + $30M lawsuit waiver + hiring | **1.0-1.5x** on $1.3B raised ($4B last valuation) | Investors got principal + small return |
| **Character.AI → Google** (Aug 2024) | $2.7B | Non-exclusive license + founders + 20% of staff | **~2.5x** on $1B valuation | Best outcome for investors |
| **Adept → Amazon** (Jun 2024) | ~$400M+ (undisclosed) | Technology license + cofounders + key staff | Investors "paid back" but not happy | Worse than Inflection |
| **Covariant → Amazon** (2024) | $400M+ | Technology license + senior talent | ~0.6x on $625M last valuation | "Zombie" company shell remains |

**Pattern:** Big Tech pays licensing fees (~$400-650M) plus acqui-hire costs to get founders and key researchers. Original company may continue as a shell. Investors typically get 0.6-1.5x their investment—not a home run, but capital preserved.

**Price per engineer:** $1-2M per top engineer/researcher, vesting over 4 years. AI researchers with foundation model experience command premium (Google reportedly paid $2.7B largely to bring back Noam Shazeer, who helped create transformers).

## Tier 2: Strategic M&A (Full Acquisition)

When an acquirer wants the whole company—platform, team, and technology.

| Deal | Value | Multiple | Strategic Rationale |
|------|-------|----------|---------------------|
| **MosaicML → Databricks** (Jul 2023) | $1.3B | **6x** last round ($222M) | Foundation model training platform |
| **Silo AI → AMD** (2024) | $665M | — | Europe's largest private AI lab |
| **Run:ai → NVIDIA** (Apr 2024) | $700M | — | GPU orchestration infrastructure |
| **Rockset → OpenAI** (Jun 2024) | — | — | Real-time analytics database |
| **ScienceIO → Veradigm** (Q1 2024) | $140M | — | Biomedical language platform |

**Pattern:** Infrastructure and tooling companies (not model builders) command full acquisition prices. MosaicML's 6x return on last round represents the best-case downside scenario—still below typical venture expectations, but solid exit.

## Tier 3: Fire Sales & Failures

When the business model doesn't work, even with AI hype.

| Company | Peak Valuation | Exit Value | Loss | Reason |
|---------|----------------|------------|------|--------|
| **Bluebird Bio** | $10B | $30M | **99.7%** | Gene therapy commercial failure |
| **Babylon Health** | $4.3B (SPAC) | $620K | **99.99%** | Cash burn, governance failures |
| **Olive AI** | $4B | Shut down | **100%** | Failed to find sustainable model |
| **Builder.ai** | $1.5B | TBD (bankruptcy) | TBD | Revenue fraud discovered |
| **Datagen** | $70M raised | ~$0 | ~100% | GenAI made synthetic data obsolete |

**Pattern:** Companies without real product-market fit, sustainable unit economics, or differentiated moats go to zero or near-zero regardless of prior valuation. AI hype does not protect bad businesses.

## Tier 4: Cautionary Tales (Acquisition Gone Wrong)

| Deal | Acquisition Price | Impairment | Write-down | Lesson |
|------|-------------------|------------|------------|--------|
| **Flatiron → Roche** (2018) | $1.9B | $3.2B | **>150%** of price | Captive data = competitor avoidance |

**Flatiron lesson:** Roche bought Flatiron for $1.9B to accelerate drug development with RWD. Result: Competitors (Pfizer, Merck, Novartis) refused to work with Roche subsidiary. Roche wrote off $1.2B in Flatiron goodwill (plus $2B Spark impairment) and is now exploring a sale.

## Downside Scenario Framework for Investment Memos

### What Determines the Floor?

| Asset | Floor Value | Who Pays |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Team (5-15 AI researchers)** | $5-30M | Big Tech acqui-hire |
| **Data (unique, proprietary)** | $50-300M | Strategic acquirer in vertical |
| **Infrastructure/tooling** | $100-700M | Platform companies (Databricks, cloud providers) |
| **Foundation models + team** | $400-2,700M | Big Tech (license + acqui-hire) |
| **None of the above** | ~$0 | Nobody |

### Probability-Weighted Downside Table (Template)

| Scenario | Exit Value | Investor Return | Probability |
|----------|------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Write-off | $0 | 0x | 15% |
| Fire sale / acqui-hire | $30-50M | 0.1-0.5x | 10% |
| **Soft landing** | $100-200M | **1.0-2.0x** | 15% |
| Strategic acquisition | $300-750M | 3-10x | 30% |
| Strong exit | $1-3B | 10-50x | 20% |
| Exceptional | $5B+ | 50x+ | 10% |

**Expected value:** Calculate as probability-weighted sum. For companies with genuine moats, expected downside typically lands in **1.0-2.0x range** (capital preservation), not zero.

## Key Takeaways for Downside Modeling

1. **License + acqui-hire is the new distressed exit.** For AI companies with valuable teams/IP, expect $400M-$650M in this structure—not zero, but not venture returns either.

2. **Investor returns in distressed scenarios: 0.6-1.5x.** Inflection's investors got 1.0-1.5x. Character.AI's got ~2.5x. Covariant's got ~0.6x. This is the realistic downside band for companies Big Tech wants.

3. **If Big Tech doesn't want you, floor is near zero.** Olive AI, Babylon, Bluebird—raised billions, exited for nothing. AI hype doesn't protect bad businesses.

4. **Team value: $1-2M per top AI researcher.** This is the acqui-hire floor math. 20 researchers = $20-40M baseline.

5. **Infrastructure beats models.** MosaicML (training infrastructure) got 6x last round. Model-only companies get license deals that barely cover capital.

6. **Captive data destroys value.** Flatiron's $1.9B acquisition resulted in $3.2B impairment. Neutral platforms (Datavant) outperform captive ones.

## Recommendations for Investment Memo

**Bull case:** Strategic acquisition by pharma/tech at 15-25x revenue (precedent: Tempus 20x, MosaicML 6x last round, Character.AI 2.7x last round)

**Base case:** Soft landing via license + acqui-hire at 1.0-2.0x last round (precedent: Inflection, Adept)

**Bear case:** Fire sale or shutdown at 0-0.5x (precedent: Olive AI, Babylon, Bluebird)

**Floor valuation formula:**
- Team: (# top AI researchers) × $1-2M
- Data: If unique + proprietary, $50-300M
- Infrastructure: If critical to AI stack, $100-700M
- Models: If Big Tech wants them, $400-2,700M (license + acqui-hire)
