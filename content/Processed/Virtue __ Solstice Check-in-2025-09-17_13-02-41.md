### Current Progress Update

- Phathom signed
	- Working through reference documents in various formats to ingest into Solstice
	- Email/banner ad generation working well, more sophisticated content requires manual handholding
	- Submission aspect requires learning - will be quite manual initially with copywriter support
	- Planning taste test next week to show sample outputs before handing over keys
	- On-site deployment model planned - spending time in person at client offices for immediate support and relationship building
- Pipeline momentum strong
	- Ipsen, Sanofi, Stemline moving quickly
	- Alexion and Takeda taking longer but progressing
	- New leads developing
- Veeva access secured
	- Full login credentials obtained
	- Can create service account for agencies and generate API keys
	- Same setup process as agencies use for submission/viewing reference documents

### Sales Strategy & Learnings

- Segmented approach by organization size
	- Large orgs (AstraZeneca, Sanofi): Focus on getting multiple champions, prove non-threatening to internal AI teams, provide sandbox access quickly
	- Mid-size orgs (Ipsen): Sell directly to brand teams, get MSA started immediately (first/second conversation)
- Sanofi case study
	- General Medicines team finding in-house creation capabilities insufficient
	- Solstice positioning as replacement rather than supplement to internal teams
	- Some template integration possible but primarily displacing internal capabilities
- Competitive positioning against agencies
	- Goal to outcompete WPP/Omnicom with 5% of their staff
	- Targeting agency spend reallocation to Solstice
	- Potential contracts worth $5-10M with large pharma (Pfizer, Merck)

### Hiring & Growth Planning

- Head of sales search active
	- Target profile: 30-35 years old, pharma commercial experience, agency background preferred
	- Young enterprise seller with life sciences focus
	- Reference to successful hires at other companies (Cam from 18T)
- Future targeting capabilities discussed
	- Current clients doing basic content distribution
	- Opportunity for claims data integration and personalization
	- Purple Lab partnership potential for revenue share model on claims data
	- Vision: MLR compliance enables downstream personalization and targeting
