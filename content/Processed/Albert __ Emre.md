### Next-Gen RPA and AI Automation Market

- UiPath’s scale enables $10B valuation through enterprise automation deployment
	- Fortune 500 companies automate hundreds of millions of hours
	- Deploy on-premise VMs for dedicated automation runtimes
	- Scale to thousands of VMs for 7-8 figure contracts
- Product maturity critical for enterprise automation orchestration
	- 70% of Fortune 500 penetration
	- Verticalized structures for deep industry deployment
- Operational playbook still developing compared to newer AI-first companies

### AI Transformation Challenges for RPA Incumbents

- Developer ecosystem differences create adoption barriers
	- RPA developers have different skill sets than agentic AI builders
	- Services companies enabling AI agent adoption require different capabilities
- Perception challenges at C-suite level for traditional RPA providers
- Need to upskill existing UiPath developers and partner ISVs for AI agent deployment
- RPA and agents are complementary but distinct technologies

### Data Fabric and Enterprise Data Models

- Data fabric positioned between simple tools (Airtable) and enterprise platforms (Palantir)
	- Palantir represents ultimate data platform with full business ontology
	- Semantic mapping between line-of-business systems enables analytics, automation, applications
- Albert’s work: No-code data modeling and visualization for business objects
	- Persist and represent data within automation processes
	- Ingest, create, and push data downstream through workflows
	- Visual representation without coding requirements

### Healthcare Exploration and Personal Mission

- Personal healthcare navigation experience during parent’s cancer treatment
	- First exposure to healthcare system complexities
	- Insurance and care coordination challenges for generally healthy individuals
- Market opportunity: Strong pull for AI adoption despite traditional slow tech adoption
- Focus areas being explored:
	- Operational workflows and back-office operations
	- Revenue cycle management (RCM) AI enhancement
	- AI-enabled care navigation and advocacy
- Interest in fully agentic care advocates for fragmented system navigation
	- Lower resource settings particularly underserved
	- Value-based care reimbursement models for AI care navigation
	- High-risk stratified groups offer significant value potential

### Next Steps

- Albert continuing healthcare space exploration through founder/investor conversations
- Emre to provide introductions to:
	- Care advocacy and navigation companies
	- Virtual/hybrid care delivery companies
	- Ben Friedberg at Oncology Ventures (Daymark investor)
	- Understood.Care team (care navigation pivot)
- Potential in-person meeting if Emre visits Seattle or Albert comes to NYC
