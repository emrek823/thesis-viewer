### Background and Business Model

- Liam’s background: left college, got pulled into management consulting in NYC
	- Similar path to Emre - quit to move to SF and start tech company
	- Built Procure (government technology company), sold to OpenGov (now part of Cox)
- PEO pain point from founder experience
	- Had to frontload medical/dental care before quitting job for startup
	- Didn’t join PEO despite recommendations due to $200/month admin fees
	- Realized could get better insurance for less money through PEO collective bargaining
- Free PEO model (“Robin Hood for PEO”)
	- No subscription/admin fees - only monetize on insurance backend
	- AI agents reduce customer service costs (biggest PEO expense)
	- Number one friction in PEO adoption is pricing

### AI Automation Strategy and Lessons

- Innovator’s dilemma approach
	- Window of opportunity to grab market share first
	- Must avoid premature scaling before proving unit economics
	- Get to percentage of work that can be automated with AI, then scale appropriately
- Zenefits cautionary tale
	- Scaled incredibly quickly to hundreds of thousands of clients, $4B valuation
	- Couldn’t automate customer support piece, had to pivot badly
- Work being automated in offshore contact centers
	- Three specialties: payroll, benefits, HR
	- 90%+ is “can you reset my password” type queries
	- 99% handled via email (not voice) - good AI use case
	- Systems: email, HRIS, database of labor laws
- Automation confidence levels
	- High confidence: information retrieval tasks
	- Moderate confidence: write access tasks (payroll corrections)
	- Initially human-in-loop for money movement, eventually full automation

### Fundraising and Timeline

- Raising $2-3M round
	- Launch beta cohort late Q1
	- Design partner with Texas PEO for data access and model improvement
	- 6-12 months to prove automation percentage and model viability
- Current status
	- Max took first half of round on Thursday
	- One space left for $1-1.5M check
	- Healthcare expertise gap identified as potential value-add
- Platform potential beyond current scope
	- Could become platform for better health insurance delivery
	- Larger healthcare narrative opportunity

### Next Steps

- Emre to discuss with Sean tomorrow
- Second 60-minute call if proceeding
	- Questions sent beforehand
	- Deep dive into specifics
- Full diligence process after second call (references, industry validation)
