## Executive Summary
Dart Health provides 50+ use cases for health systems and post-acute care providers built off the same AI infrastructure to ingest and analyze clinical data. Dart has shown early validation that this infrastructure enables 1) rapid deployment of 2) a multi-product platform with 3) high accuracy for complex use cases. The company has generated $1.1M ARR in the last 3 quarters with >75% margins on <$300k burned.

Veeraj Mehta (CEO) and Aakruti Desai (CCO) are the youngest founders we have backed to-date (21/22). Veeraj didn't go to college and Aakruti dropped out of Berkeley her freshman year to start MarketFly together (Marketing agency SaaS). In 2022, they raised a $600K round for Dart (fka Puzzl), and over the past 3 years they have evolved from a platform for independent gig workers to a compliance platform for healthcare to a full AI deployment platform for healthcare.

In a healthcare AI deployment category without a clear playbook, Dart has been learning by building and architected the entire business around the unique advantages of building core infrastructure vs. another point solution. The initial sales pitch is multi-product ("Tell us your problems and we'll build for you"). Data integrations using LLMs (next-gen RPA, interop translation) reduces time to ROI. Increased accuracy and performance with fine-tuned embeddings on a customer's specific patient population drives the complexity of workflows they can tackle. Subject matter experts can spin up new workflows in days/weeks by writing prompts and evaluating initial output in days, driving land-and-expand (and NDR).

## Slide 3
Dart has built end-to-end, healthcare-specific infrastructure that is comprised of multiple components that general LLMOps companies have raised tens of millions of dollars to tackle (Unstructured.io for data integration, Guardrails.ai for observability, Weights & Biases for prompt engineering, etc). They have been dogfooding this horizontal platform with vertical specific use cases within post-acute care and home health over the last 12 months. As reasoning improves for general LLM models, “easy" use cases based on analyzing clinical data (referrals, prior auth, UM, etc) are becoming commoditized. The real differentiator are in the messy edge cases where ROI is highest and accuracy requires infrastructure-level sophistication (patient graphs, domain-specific ontologies, feedback loops, and fine-tuned embeddings) vs. context engineering.

Over the last 3 quarters, Dart has been focused on post-acute care and has run 2M analyses on 200K patients records to build and pressure test this comprehensive AI infrastructure across 20 customers. Their GTM strategy to-date has been more hustle and guerrilla marketing and the major goal for the next 12 months is to continue their health system expansion (Mayo, Atrium, Duke, Dartmouth, and Albany currently in pipeline).

We are excited to invest $2m at a $20M valuation (post-money SAFE) to support Dart in expanding to health systems, continuing platform development to enable rapid deployment (auditing/ETL pipelines) and cementing additional, repeatable use cases (FWA, readmissions, etc).

## Team
Veeraj and Aakruti grew up together in Southern California and first built a business together in high school in 2020 called MarketFly, focused on providing customer service through social media, that was acquired for $300K in 2020. Veeraj never went to college and Aakruti dropped out of Berkeley her freshman year to pursue startups full-time.

Veeraj started building software in 9th and 10th grade when he automated pharmacy operations for his Dad's independent pharmacy. His work to add additional revenue generating services, automate back-end tasks, and revamp the hiring plan 5x'd the net income of his practice and changed his family's financial situation. This was all when he was 14 years old.

## Slide 4
Aakruti has similarly had the entrepreneurial bug from her family experience, which led to her joining Veeraj full time in 2020 on MarketFly. Aakruti is the hustle behind the scenes running GTM, BD, hiring, and all things operations to keep the scrappy, founder-led company running.

This is the youngest team we have backed at Virtue but represents a new trend we are seeing where AI-native founders fundamentally rethink workflows in the LLM age where playbooks have not yet been defined. No one knows how to best fine-tune embeddings for patient profiles or annotate clinical data to squeeze out the last 10% of accuracy or build document processing tools for LLMs that understand a longitudinal patient profile. You have to hack these things together.

Beyond Veeraj and Aakruti, Dart has 4 other employees.
*   Shilpa Gummadi (Founding Strategy & Operations)
*   2 Brazilian Engineers - Marcelo and Gustavo - that have built AI products used by millions in Brazil. To-date, Dart has found that Brazil has strong talent density and cost: quality ratio and will likely continue to invest in this strategy.
*   Christian Trujillo (Integrations and customer success) - recently hired after working with Veeraj at MarketFly 4 years ago

Over the rest of this year with additional capital, they are looking to bring on additional team members they have already identified and engaged (Alex Moss and Ramya Muthukrishnan). In this day and age where every single company of ours is looking for a founding engineer, the ability to hire high-quality, young talent that matches the hard-working culture of Dart is indispensable.

## Market
### TAM
The market size or TAM for Dart isn't as clean because they are a multi-product platform covering many historical categories that are all focused around clinical documentation. If we take the use cases and customers Dart Health is working with today and extrapolate out of a few years (expanding to different customers like payers or new use cases within pop health analytics), we conservatively estimate the total market to be $33B across all the use cases on the top.

## Problem / Why Now
Providers are facing headwinds that impact margins. Healthcare providers have always had low operating margins margins (2-5%), but efforts to improve margins are becoming increasingly challenging. Provider organizations now have to juggle many issues, including persistent economic and inflation pressures, workforce struggles, evolving utilization trends, increasing competition, and supply chain problems. Health system operating margins largely recovered following sizable volatility in recent years, but expenses continue to rise across the board (11%+ over last 2 years). At the same time, hospitals' expense have been met with inadequate increases in reimbursement by government payers and increasing administrative burden due to inappropriate commercial health insurer practices. Dart is able to serve providers a broad AI deployment platform that drives margin vs. simply a tool for a single workflow.

Early adoption of AI in administrative workflows is fueling platform demand. Health systems and post-acute providers have seen meaningful ROI from initial AI deployments: for example, SmarterDx's CDI platform has demonstrated ~$2M in incremental revenue per 10K discharges in peer-reviewed case studies. Scribe adoption has grown rapidly in both inpatient and outpatient settings, demonstrating provider willingness to embed AI into daily workflows. Many health systems now have established AI governance committees and security review processes, lowering procurement friction for new AI deployments. Even smaller home health organizations (e.g., AdvantageCare) have CEO-level mandates to adopt AI. The conversation has shifted from “should we use AI” to “how do we scale it across use cases?".

## Slide 6
Procurement is shifting from point solutions to consolidated platforms. After piloting 8-10 discrete AI applications in 2023, enterprise buyers are converging on 1–2 vendors that can safely ingest, reason over, and act on clinical data across multiple workflows. They are increasingly frustrated by having separate tools for CDI, quality reporting, readmission review, RPM monitoring, and screening—all of which require access to the same patient records. Platforms like Dart benefit from a single security review and can deploy new use cases without restarting the sales cycle, enabling faster time-to-value and higher net dollar retention

Commoditization is eroding point solution defensibility. Competitors such as Brellium ($16.7M Series A), Charta ($22M Series A), Tennr ($100M Series C), Layer ($20M Series A), and Anterior ($25M Series A) have each built strong positions in narrow verticals (e.g., chart auditing, quality, referrals, UM). But as generic LLM reasoning improves, "easy” use cases—like standard CDI gap detection or basic referral screening—are becoming commoditized. The real competitive battleground is in messy, edge-case-heavy workflows where ROI is highest and accuracy requires infrastructure-level assets: patient graphs, domain-specific ontologies, feedback loops, and fine-tuned embeddings. Point solutions tend to raise more capital to chase distribution in their narrow niche, making them slower to adapt. Dart's core infrastructure was deliberately and patiently built to address this last 20% of complexity, positioning it to scale as the market shifts

## Use Cases
Dart positions itself as the “AI Deployment Partner for Enterprise Healthcare" and offers a comprehensive library of AI workflows and use cases (shown here). Fundamentally, Dart can enable all of these use cases because of how they've built internal infrastructure and how they rely on customer for subject matter expertise.

## Slide 7
### Clinical AI Use Cases
Explore our comprehensive library of 100+ clinical AI workflows designed to transform healthcare delivery and improve patient outcomes.

*   AI-Powered Analysis

*   **Report (quality/registry):** Health Maintenance Gaps, Vaccination AEs, Transfusion Appropriateness.

## Slide 8
First, Dart asks customers about their core problems and emphasize that they can analyze clinical data for virtually any use case. Once a customer decides on a use case, Dart's Applied Product Engineers (APEs; think FDEs) create a list of criteria alongside the team (surgical centers discharge/transfer checklist, malnutrition policies, VBC contracts, etc). Dart makes it easy for a customer's Chief Cardiology Officer, Revenue Cycle Manager, Registered Dietitian, Pop Health team, and anyone else to say “Hey! I'd love to get notified if a patient's chart indicates X" & start checking for it with just a few prompts.

### Malnutrition Dashboard Example
**Analytics**
*   124 New Cases +12%
*   100 Accepted ↑12%
*   $100,540 Net New Revenue ↑9%
*   **Epic: Orlando Instance** Last sync: 2 minutes ago
*   Today's Patient Population Reviewed

**Main Results Activity Analytics Settings**

| Visit Date | Patient | Provider | Type         | Status      | Risk | Grade |           |
| :--------- | :------ | :------- | :----------- | :---------- | :--- | :---- | :-------- |
| 07/05/24   | 00110   | Dr. Oz   | Encounter Note | Needs Review | High | 50    | Review    |
| 07/05/24   | 00110   | Dr. Oz   | Encounter Note | Needs Review | High | 100   | Review    |
| 07/05/24   | 00110   | Dr. Oz   | Encounter Note | Accepted    | Medium | 80    | Accepted  |

The platform has broad applications, but Dart has prioritized these use cases internally based on what is defensible and durable. Last year, Dart engaged with a DME company that is now one of Tennr's (referral automation; $100M+ Series C) largest customer. They chose not to go forward with referrals because the workflows are relatively simple (OCR fax → summarize in EMR) and don't provide any compounding advantages to the platform. This decision calculus may evolve over time as the infrastructure improves, but these early (and purposeful) decisions have fueled the development of true AI infrastructure.

## AI Infrastructure
What Dart is doing is more complex than an API call or a simple RAG pipeline on top of generic embeddings. They have built the entire AI infrastructure that enables 3 core advantages
*   Fast deployment
*   Multi-product approach

## Slide 9
*   Higher accuracy across complex use cases

The platform is broken down in a simplified model below, but there are multiple internal diagrams that drive slight differences in data flow (embeddings vs. LLM, fine-tuning vs. prompt engineering, etc).

## Slide 10
### Dart Health AI Infrastructure
*   **Data Ingestion Layer**
    *   RPA | OCR | FHIR/HL7 Feeds | Direct SQL | BYOC APIs

*   **Patient Graph / Profile Construction**
    *   Builds per-patient "mini-network" linking every datum by timestamp, provider, and care plan

*   **Transformation & Multi-Tier Filtering Pipeline**
    1.  ML/Embedding Pre-classification
    2.  Contextual chunking w/ metadata tags
    3.  LLM prep (ensures small, clean prompts)

*   **Rules & Domain Knowledge (Health Ontology)**
    *   Natural-language rules (>200 per org)
    *   Yes/No/N/A constrained outputs to avoid hallucination

*   **Model Orchestration & Execution Engine**
    *   Gemini Flash / 2.5 or customer-supplied LLMs
    *   Fine-tuned embedding models for similarity search
    *   Runtime cost ≈ $100 per 1k charts

*   **DartX: Data & Training Studio**
    *   Curate/label datasets (clinicians-in-loop)
    *   Auto-evals & experiment tracking
    *   Fine-tune (LoRA/SFT) embeddings/LLMs

*   **DartX: Model Registry & Hot-Swap**
    *   Versioned models w/ rollout gates
    *   Publish to orchestration for serving

*   **Action & Output Layer**

    *   Threshold triggers (e.g., <70% confidence alerts)

*   **Feedback / Judge-Model Loop**
    *   Clinician feedback captured inline
    *   Judge model scores outputs → RLHF rapid fine-tunes
    *   Typical cycle: 2 wks labeling + 1 wk validation

*   **Security & Deployment (applies across all layers)**
    *   HIPAA/BAA | Audit logs & lineage | PHI redaction
    *   VPC / On-prem / Customer cloud (air-gapped optional)
    *   Field-level encryption | SSO/RBAC | Secrets mgmt

## Slide 11
At seed/early stage, most vendors glue together third-party pieces. Dart has already built and production-ized the full stack: ingestion, patient graph, multi-tier filtering, rules/guardrails, model orchestration, DartX labeling/evals, model registry & hot-swap, action layer, judge-model loop, and enterprise deployment (VPC/on-prem, audit logs, PHI redaction). Dart can show up, pick from 50+ workflows, fine-tune on ~100 local charts, and ship in weeks vs. months. Commercially, it powers true land-and-expand. Every new use case leverages the same platform and action outputs, so marginal cost stays low (~$5k compute to deliver ~$1M ROI.) This is also what cracks the “last 20%”: edge-case clinical rules, provenance, and safe model updates need a patient graph, guardrails, and tight feedback loops.

The table below benchmarks Dart's components against VC-backed point solutions in the broad LLMOps stack to highlight the breadth and maturity of the platform today.

## Commercial
GTM to-date has been essentially guerilla marketing and hustle that has enabled them to reach $1.3M in ARR over the last 3 quarters. Dart closed its first $200K contract in August and is beginning conversations with health systems as it expands up market from PAC / home health.

### Current / Pipeline:
For an early-stage company with no formal GTM strategy, the current, pilot, and pipeline growth has been impressive (n=42). As mentioned, a majority of this revenue has been closed in the last 2 quarters. Currently, Dart has an average/median ACV of $67K/$58K. Just in Q3-2025 (still ongoing) Dart signed its first 4 6-figure ACV contracts. It's largest to-date ($200K with Remarkable Hopsice) closed ahead of schedule and with higher ACV (originally pegged at $75K).

To-date, the Dart team has been extremely scrappy with its GTM strategy and only has 1 advisor - Alissa - today that has been part-time making intros to her network. Other home health / PAC customers have been through cold outreach or meeting at conferences. In other circumstances, Dart found creative ways to identify potential customers with willingness to buy. For example, Atrium Health posted an article on Collaborative Development of a rules-based electronic health record algorithm for Hospital-at-Home eligibility. The Dart team reached out and tactfully mentioned they could drive better accuracy and deploy in weeks for a paper that took Atrium's internal team 12 months. This initial wedge around H@H eligibility has led to discussions for other use cases as well, validating the land-and-expand strategy.

The biggest shift with this financing is to bottle-up and formalize creative tactics around GTM like those mentioned above (bottoms-up) and help bring in other advisors to open up doors and drive strategy (tops-down). For example, there is the potential to leverage GTM connectivity in a geography to growth from PAC

## Slide 14
networks to health systems in the same geography. The current business model / pricing is unoptimized and Dart has been underselling just to get in the door. Going forward, the focus is 2-fold

*   **Close Health Systems.** There are already 6 hospitals in the pipeline and goal is to close these at ACVs in the mid-to-high six figure range (based on comps in space + ROI Dart provides). In tandem, Dart will identify and solidify use cases health systems are most interested in so they can scale these to new health system customers.
*   **Continue to Validate Land-and-expand.** The land-and-expand motion will be validated initially in PAC / HH customers, especially mid-size and larger groups like AdvantageCare or Maxim that are already asking for more use cases.

## Competition
Today, Dart directly competes with home health / post-acute care auditing and QA tools like Brellium and Charta.

**Brellium ($16.7M Series A; Series A materials here):** Brellium raised a $16.7M Series A in 2024 at a $40m post-money valuation with $1.4M in ARR after being founded in 2021. Brellium works with behavioral health clinics and home health, therapy, and hospices around the country. Dart Health went head-to-head against Brellium at one its hospice customers (Kindful Health) after Brellium took 3 months before delivering something they could even deploy. Dart was able to get this up and running in weeks. This is one of many concrete examples of the flexibility of Dart's platform in home health / PAC that can extend into other provider types (health systems).

**Charta ($22M Series A; Seed deck here for $40M post-money):** Charta Health is focused on outpatient CDI, of which a big portion is focused on QA/auditing. Charta (fka Limo Health) launched in the spring of 2024 and scaled to $465K in ARR. They served a broad array of customers like Eventus Whole Health, Kids Care Home Health, Third Eye Health, Post Pediatric Therapies, Accurate Neuromonitoring, and others. Charta with their Series A has begun to expand beyond audit/compliance to revenue integrity, risk adjustment, and denial prevention, signaling a similar focus to expand as Dart. We have not yet seen Charta enter the hospital market

## Slide 15
Charta and Brellium are going head-to-head frequently in the outpatient setting, so much so that SEO for Charta drives you to the Brellium comparison shown below. Brellium is positioning its focus on compliance, payer-facing solutions, and some mundane analytics / reporting (table-stakes; more for positioning than real differentiator).

### How we stack up

## Financials / Milestones
Today, Dart is net income positive with $15K in net income (not burn!) per month while generating $1.3M in ARR with 75-85% gross margins. Internally, Dart Health has the goal of getting to $10M in ARR over the next 12 months. We agree that this growth is possible given the characteristics of the business, evidence shown to-date, and market opportunity. To provide additional scenarios for growth, but to

## Slide 16
set more concrete goals and KPIs for the team to track, we've agreed on following milestones with the team

*   Close 2-3 health systems in the next 3 months to have case studies in ROI to scale outreach and marketing of those use cases in 2026
*   Demonstrate land-and-expand potential with health system customer
*   Platform development to improve governance, security, monitoring, and integrations.
*   Sandbox development to ensure audits/historical lookbacks and implementation from demo to pilot is rapid.

## Opportunities / Risks
### Opportunities
*   **AI Infrastructure.** This an evolution of the AI market in healthcare and an arbitrage moment over the next 2-3 years we have recognized at Virtue where healthcare-specific deployment infrastructure can win against point solutions.
*   **High upside team.** Veeraj and Aakruti are the youngest team we have backed and have reached an inflection point in the business and their maturity as founders (e.g., lessons learned around hiring/firing too slow) and have the slope to become top-decile founders in market over the next 2-3 years (similar to Shubh @ Integral, Aris/Yiwen @ Solstice).
*   **Capital efficiency to large outcomes.** Dart has burned $300K and reached $1.3M in ARR over the last 3 quarters with a majority of that over the last 2 quarters. Internally, the team has a goal to be at $10M in ARR with $2-3M in net income over the next 12 months. This is aggressive but doable given what we've seen with the team to-date.

### Risks
*   **Young, first time founding team.** As with any first-time founding team entering healthcare, there is the risk of these “outsiders” struggling to enter the old boys club in healthcare. Fundamentally, we have seen the health system and general provider buying process shift dramatically. The typical trope around sales cycles being 18-24 months is no longer true for health systems as we've seen our companies go from demo to contract in weeks. We

## Slide 17
feel confident in this risk given the sales velocity to-date and will continue to mitigate this risk by supercharging creative GTM hacks (channel partners, guerilla marketing techniques like scraping AI job postings for health systems, etc) and helping them build out a more formal GTM team.

*   **AI Infra commoditizes / reasoning improves.** Today, AI infrastructure is required to solve the last 20% of complexity given the general reasoning of LLMs today (GPT-5 launched during the diligence process). There is a world where this reasoning improves, context windows become large enough, model providers train on enough healthcare data, or Epic/OpenAI launch more products in healthcare. We are more confident in this risk because Dart is collecting tribal knowledge of complex workflows (H@H eligibility) that are not found in textbooks (like medical coding). The type of work that Dart is doing today around deployment and personalization of use cases is certainly possible if OpenAI staffed up a team of 100 FDEs in healthcare, but is much less likely than them partnering with a Dart.

*   **Expansion beyond post-acute home health.** Majority of Dart's business to-date has been in post-acute care and home health, while the focus going forward is on larger health systems. There is a risk that they are unable to crack this GTM or the platform doesn't scale to health system use cases. We are more confident in mitigating this GTM risk given the health system pipeline to-date and how health systems are moving away from point solutions after the adoption over the last few years. From a platform perspective, the platform is actually more complicated for home health / PAC (500 questions / prompts) vs. initial health system use cases (20 questions/prompts). The bigger barrier is deployment/integration, which is a non-trivial but known risk to be solved .
