## Abstract

Precise probabilistic information about drug-target interaction (DTI) predictions is vital for understanding limitations and boosting predictive performance. Gaussian processes (GP) offer a scalable framework to integrate state-of-the-art DTI representations and Bayesian inference, enabling novel operations, such as Bayesian classification with rejection, top-$K$ selection, and ranking. We propose a deep kernel learning-based GP architecture (DTI-GP), which incorporates a combined neural embedding module for chemical compounds and protein targets, and a GP module. The workflow continues with sampling from the predictive distribution to estimate a Bayesian precedence matrix, which is used in fast and accurate selection and ranking operations. DTI-GP outperforms state-of-the-art solutions, and it allows (1) the construction of a Bayesian accuracy-confidence enrichment score, (2) rejection schemes for improved enrichment, and (3) estimation and search for top-$K$ selections and ranking with high expected utility.
