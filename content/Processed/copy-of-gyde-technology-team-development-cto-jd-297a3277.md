Gyde | Technology Team Development

Context

Gyde, an AI-native insurance brokerage platform, is actively seeking a CTO and Founding Engineer with a deep background in AI. We currently have one engineer committed, Enrique Espaillat, and would strongly prefer to pair him with team members who have a deeper background in AI to round out the launch team.

Gyde will initially lean on an inorganically driven growth strategy, acquiring agencies and optimizing their operations and economics through the use of Gyde’s AI platform. Key automation and product categories for the platform include Enrollment and Renewal, Customer Service, Cross-Sell, Personalized Plan Recommendation, Member Engagement, and HIPAA-compliant data infrastructure development.

Over time, Gyde will transform these brokerage assets into robust, longitudinal health management vehicles that partner with carriers to deliver market-leading member experiences and clinical outcomes for the populations we serve. Services we can provide include driving members to Primary Care Physicians, managing member medication adherence and utilization, and utilizing data from our platform to appropriately stratify the population and enroll cohorts into clinical programs at the start of a plan year.

We are prioritizing the execution of the brokerage roll-up first, but an ideal candidate can also help us execute the transformation of these assets.

Candidate Profiles

We are seeking candidates with deep AI expertise, or at a minimum, some degree of experience building AI-driven workflow automations or voice / chat agents. I have included a larger JD for the CTO below, which can serve as a larger overview of what we’re looking for. We think three candidate profiles could be a fit, and we’ve linked prospects we’ve actively engaged as examples:

Tenured Forward-Deployed Engineer: Many of these individuals come from Palantir, but this profile is someone who has experience rolling up their sleeves at a client site and building products from scratch.

Head of AI / ML at InsureTech: Deep expertise in the industry and would be a strong complement to Sam and I.

Software Engineer at leading AI Platform: While we’d likely need to spend time with these team members on the industry and ICP nuances, their technical skillset is exactly what we’re looking for. The individual I’ve linked, Eric, is a bit of a unicorn in that he possesses both qualities.

Finally, from a company targeting perspective, we think top decile talent at Palantir, Ramp, Rippling, Oscar, Devoted, Decagon, Scale, Sierra, Headway, Thatch, Chapter, Stripe, and Nourish would be a strong fit for what we’re building.

CTO Job Description

## Gyde Health

## The insurance broker is an underleveraged asset within the healthcare value chain and is ripe for AI-enabled transformation. The broker of the future will become 1) a single source for a member's comprehensive insurance needs and 2) a more robust, longitudinal guide through the healthcare system. The latter will be done in partnership with carriers, and would support Stars measures, driving members to top-performing PCPs, compliantly exchanging data to enable earlier enrollment into clinical programs, and more.

## To enable this transformation, Gyde is building an AI-native brokerage platform developed through a combination of brokerage acquisitions and technology. The platform will become a chassis to manage a member for their entire lifetime, functioning as a guide for insurance and healthcare needs. The current combination of policy developments and technological advancements presents a compelling reason to build this now, and Gyde has assembled a team of Oscar, Spark, and Stripe leaders to bring this vision to life. Seed funding is led by Lightspeed, with participation from Virtue and Crystal Venture Partners.

–

Gyde is the first AI-enable brokerage engineered to provide clients with longitudinal support throughout the healthcare system. Our brokers are truly the entry point to care for their clients and serve as the single source of their client’s comprehensive insurance needs. In doing so, our AI-native platform unlocks unparalleled growth for our brokers, transforming them to market and industry leaders.

Gyde is assembling the most talented team in the industry in order to bring this vision to life; the founding team already boasts pedigrees from Oscar, Spark, and Stripe. And our seed funding was led by Lightspeed, with participation from Virtue and Crystal Venture Partners.
