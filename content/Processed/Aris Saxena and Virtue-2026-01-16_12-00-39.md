### Pitch Deck Feedback Session

- Reviewed Solstice pitch deck revisions with design agency
	- Added company description immediately after TLDR for clarity
	- Moved “What we are” earlier vs later commercialization engine explanation
	- Flow: Problem → Market → Product walkthrough
- Key pitch talk track refined:
	- AI Pharma marketing agency solving regulatory content creation bottleneck
	- $50k, 2-month timeline for simple email vs instant Solstice solution
	- Content creation ($12B market) → eventual full commercial stack expansion
	- Commoditized pharma products increase brand/content importance

### Critical Deck Improvements Needed

- “Why Now” slide requires major strengthening
	- Current model-specific references (Gemini 3, Opus 4.5) lack investor confidence
	- Need specific functionality examples vs generic model updates
		- HTML compilation improved from 35% to 98% success rate
		- Zero-error compliance requirement differentiator
	- Simplify to 3 buckets: Commercial pressures, regulatory tailwinds, LLM advances
	- Quantify each category with specific metrics/percentages
- Traction slide messaging:
	- Replace “scaled to $2.3M ARR” with “$2.3M ARR in 4 months”
	- Add “expansion across new and existing clients” clarification
- GTM projections need validation:
	- $1B ARR target may lack credibility vs $500M alternative
	- Remove “controlling commercial stack” language
	- Verify brand count math for top 50 pharma expansion model

### Product Differentiation & Defense

- Compliance complexity demonstration strong:
	- PFS (Progression Free Survival) secondary endpoint example
	- Requires clinical context, primary endpoint pairing, safety information
	- Tribal industry knowledge integration beyond FDA publications
- Defensibility through proprietary reasoning layer vs pure model dependency
	- Need clear performance attribution: Solstice improvements vs model improvements
	- Balance riding model wave while maintaining unique differentiation
