# BYLAWS OF NEURABLE INC.

## ARTICLE I. STOCKHOLDERS

### Section 1.01 Place of Meetings.
All meetings of the stockholders shall be held at such place, if any, either within or without the State of Delaware, as shall be designated from time to time by resolution of the Board of Directors (as defined in Section 2.01) and stated in the notice of meeting.

### Section 1.02 Annual Meeting.
The annual meeting of the stockholders for the election of directors and for the transaction of such other business as may properly come before the meeting shall be held at such date, time and place, if any, as shall be determined by the Board of Directors and stated in the notice of the meeting.

### Section 1.03 Special Meetings.
Special meetings of stockholders for any purpose or purposes shall be called pursuant to a resolution approved by the Board of Directors and may not be called by any other person or persons. The only business which may be conducted at a special meeting shall be the matter or matters set forth in the notice of such meeting.

### Section 1.04 Adjournments.
Any meeting of the stockholders, annual or special, may be adjourned from time to time to reconvene at the same or some other place, if any, and notice need not be given of any such adjourned meeting if the time, place, if any, thereof and the means of remote communication, if any, are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting, the Corporation may transact any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than 30 days, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. If after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for stockholders entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting, the Board of Directors shall fix a new record date for notice of the adjourned meeting and shall give notice of the adjourned meeting to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting as of the record date fixed for notice of the adjourned meeting.

### Section 1.05 Notice of Meetings.
Notice of the place, if any, date, hour, the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting (if such date is different from the record date for stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting) and means of remote communication, if any, of every meeting of stockholders shall be given by the Corporation not less than ten days nor more than 60 days before the meeting (unless a different time is specified by law) to every stockholder entitled to vote at the meeting as of the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting. Notices of special meetings shall also specify the purpose or purposes for which the meeting has been called. Except as otherwise provided herein or permitted by applicable law, notice to stockholders shall be in writing and delivered personally or mailed to the stockholders at their address appearing on the books of the Corporation. Without limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given effectively to stockholders, notice of meetings may be given to stockholders by means of electronic transmission in accordance with applicable law. Notice of any meeting need not be given to any stockholder who shall,
either before or after the meeting, submit a waiver of notice or who shall attend such meeting, except when the stockholder attends for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Any stockholder so waiving notice of the meeting shall be bound by the proceedings of the meeting in all respects as if due notice thereof had been given.

### Section 1.06 List of Stockholders.
The officer of the Corporation who has charge of the stock ledger shall prepare a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders (provided, however, if the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote is less than ten days before the date of the meeting, the list shall reflect the stockholders entitled to vote as of the tenth day before the meeting date), arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares of each class of capital stock of the Corporation registered in the name of each stockholder at least ten days before any meeting of the stockholders. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, on a reasonably accessible electronic network if the information required to gain access to such list was provided with the notice of the meeting or during ordinary business hours, at the principal place of business of the Corporation for a period of at least ten days before the meeting. If the meeting is to be held at a place, the list shall also be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting the whole time thereof and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present. If the meeting is held solely by means of remote communication, the list shall also be open for inspection by any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting as provided by applicable law. Except as provided by applicable law, the stock ledger of the Corporation shall be the only evidence as to who are the stockholders entitled to examine the stock ledger and the list of stockholders or to vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of stockholders.

### Section 1.07 Quorum.
Unless otherwise required by law, the Corporation’s Certificate of Incorporation (the “Certificate of Incorporation”) or these by-laws, at each meeting of the stockholders, a majority in voting power of the shares of the Corporation entitled to vote at the meeting, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum. If, however, such quorum shall not be present or represented at any meeting of the stockholders, the stockholders entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall have power, by the affirmative vote of a majority in voting power thereof, to adjourn the meeting from time to time, in the manner provided in Section 1.04, until a quorum shall be present or represented. A quorum, once established, shall not be broken by the subsequent withdrawal of enough votes to leave less than a quorum. At any such adjourned meeting at which there is a quorum, any business may be transacted that might have been transacted at the meeting originally called.

### Section 1.08 Conduct of Meetings.
The Board of Directors may adopt by resolution such rules and regulations for the conduct of the meeting of the stockholders as it shall deem appropriate. At every meeting of the stockholders, the Chief Executive Officer, or in his or her absence or inability to act, the President, or, in his or her absence or inability to act, the person whom the President shall appoint, shall act as chairman of, and preside at, the meeting. The Secretary or, in his or her absence or inability to act, the person whom the chairman of the meeting shall appoint secretary of the meeting, shall act as secretary of the meeting and keep the minutes thereof. Except to the extent inconsistent with such rules and regulations as adopted by the Board of Directors, the chairman of any meeting of the stockholders shall have the right and authority to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and to do all such acts as, in the judgment of such chairman, are appropriate for the proper conduct of the meeting. Such rules, regulations or procedures, whether adopted by the Board of Directors or prescribed by the chairman of the meeting, may include, without limitation, the following: (a) the establishment of an agenda or order of business for the meeting; (b) the determination of when the polls shall open and close for any given matter to be voted on at the meeting; (c) rules and procedures for maintaining order at the meeting and the safety of those present; (d) limitations on attendance at or participation in the meeting to stockholders of record of the corporation, their duly authorized and constituted proxies or such other persons as the
chairman of the meeting shall determine; (e) restrictions on entry to the meeting after the time fixed for the commencement thereof; and (f) limitations on the time allotted to questions or comments by participants.

### Section 1.09 Voting; Proxies.
Unless otherwise required by law or the Certificate of Incorporation the election of directors shall be decided by a plurality of the votes cast at a meeting of the stockholders by the holders of stock entitled to vote in the election. Unless otherwise required by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these by-laws, any matter, other than the election of directors, brought before any meeting of stockholders shall be decided by the affirmative vote of the majority of shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the matter. Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders or to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder by proxy, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. A stockholder may revoke any proxy which is not irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in person or by delivering to the secretary of the Corporation a revocation of the proxy or a new proxy bearing a later date. Voting at meetings of stockholders need not be by written ballot.

### Section 1.10 Written Consent of Stockholders Without a Meeting.
Any action to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent or consents in writing, setting forth the action to be so taken, shall be signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted and shall be delivered (by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested) to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business or an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded. Every written consent shall bear the date of signature of each stockholder who signs the consent, and no written consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless, within 60 days of the earliest dated consent delivered in the manner required by this Section 1.10, written consents signed by a sufficient number of holders to take action are delivered to the Corporation as aforesaid. Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall, to the extent required by applicable law, be given to those stockholders who have not consented in writing, and who, if the action had been taken at a meeting, would have been entitled to notice of the meeting if the record date for notice of such meeting had been the date that written consents signed by a sufficient number of holders to take the action were delivered to the Corporation.

### Section 1.11 Fixing the Record Date.
(a) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which record date shall not be more than 60 nor less than ten days before the date of such meeting. If the Board of Directors so fixes a date, such date shall also be the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting unless the Board of Directors determines, at the time it fixes such record date, that a later date on or before the date of the meeting shall be the date for making such determination. If no record date is fixed by the Board of Directors, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held. A determination of
stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting and in such case shall also fix as the record date for stockholders entitled to notice of such adjourned meeting the same or an earlier date as that fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote therewith at the adjourned meeting.

(b) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which record date shall not be more than ten days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting: (i) when no prior action by the Board of Directors is required by law, the record date for such purpose shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the Corporation by delivery (by hand, or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested) to its registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business, or an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded and (ii) if prior action by the Board of Directors is required by law, the record date for such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action.

## ARTICLE II. BOARD OF DIRECTORS

### Section 2.01 Number.
The board of directors of the Corporation (the “Board of Directors”) shall consist of up to three directors. This number may be set or changed by a resolution of the Board of Directors or of the stockholders, subject to Sections 2.03 and 2.04 of these Bylaws. No reduction of the authorized number of directors shall have the effect of removing any director before such director's term of office expires.

### Section 2.02 Election of Directors; Term of Office.
The Directors of the Corporation shall be elected at the annual meeting of the stockholders or at any meeting of the stockholders held in lieu of such annual meeting, which meeting, for the purposes of these Bylaws, shall be deemed the annual meeting. Directors shall be elected for a term ending upon the date of the next annual meeting of stockholders, but shall hold office until their successors are elected or appointed, and have qualified.

### Section 2.03 Resignation.
Any Director may resign his/her office at any time. Such resignation shall be made in writing and shall take effect immediately without acceptance.

### Section 2.04 Removal of Directors.
Any Director may be removed from office at any time, with or without cause, by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares then entitled to vote at an election of the members of the Board of Directors, or as otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation.

### Section 2.05 Vacancies.
Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, in the event of a vacancy occurring on the Board of Directors, the remaining Directors, by affirmative vote of a majority thereof, whether or not constituting a quorum, may fill such vacancy for the unexpired term. If at any time the number of Directors shall be increased, the additional Directors to be elected may be elected by the Directors then in office by the affirmative vote of a majority thereof at a regular meeting or at a
special meeting called for that purpose, to serve until the next election of the members of the Board of Directors, unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation.

Meetings of the Board of Directors may be held at such places either within or without the State of Delaware as the Board of Directors shall from time to time determine.

Written notice of each special meeting of the Board of Directors shall be given which shall state the date, time and place of the meeting. The written notice of any special meeting shall be given to each director at the location of such director shown on the books and records of the Corporation at least twenty-four (24) hours in advance of the meeting. Notice may be given by mail, courier, facsimile or electronic and shall be deemed to have been given when received, if sent by mail or courier, or when transmitted by facsimile or electronic mail, as the case may be. Notice need not be given of any regularly scheduled meeting of the Board of Directors, provided that each Director shall have received notice of the date, time and place, or method of determining the date, time and place, of such regularly scheduled meeting.

### Section 2.09 Quorum; Vote Required for Action.
Unless otherwise required by law, at each meeting of the Board of Directors, the presence of a majority of the total number of directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. The vote of a majority of the directors present at a meeting where a quorum is present shall be required to approve any matter before the Board of Directors. In case at any meeting of the Board of Directors a quorum shall not be present, the members of the Board of Directors present may by majority vote adjourn the meeting from time to time until a quorum shall attend.

## ARTICLE III. OFFICERS

### Section 3.01 Officers.
The officers of the Corporation shall consist of a Chief Executive Officer, a President, a Secretary, a Treasurer and such other officers as the Board of Directors may determine. An individual may hold more than one office.

### Section 3.02 Election; Term of Office; Vacancies.
Officers shall be elected by a majority of a quorum of the Board of Directors. Except as otherwise provided by the Board of Directors, when electing any officer, each officer shall hold office indefinitely until death, resignation or removal. The Board of Directors may remove any officer or agent with or without cause at any time. Any such removal shall be without prejudice to the contractual rights of such officer or agent, if any, with the Corporation, but the election of an officer or agent shall not of itself create contractual rights. Any vacancy occurring in any office of the Corporation by death, resignation, removal or otherwise may be filled by a majority of a quorum of the Board of Directors.

### Section 3.03 Chief Executive Officer.
The Chief Executive Officer shall preside at all meetings of the Board of Directors and of the stockholders.

In the event of the
absence or disability of the Chief Executive Officer, such other officer of the Corporation as the Chief Executive Officer may from time to time designate shall have the duties and powers of the Chief Executive Officer for the duration of such absence or disability, unless and until the Board of Directors shall otherwise determine.

### Section 3.04 President.
In the absence of the Chief Executive Officer, the President shall preside at all meetings of the Board of Directors and of the stockholders. The President shall have such other duties and powers as the Board of Directors or the Chief Executive Officer (if such office is not held by the President) shall from time to time delegate to the President.

### Section 3.05 Secretary.
The Secretary shall have the general duties and powers of a secretary of a corporation and such other duties and powers as the Board of Directors or the Chief Executive Officer shall from time to time delegate to the Secretary. The Secretary shall have the duty to record in a book to be kept for that purpose the proceedings of the meetings of the stockholders, the Board of Directors and any committees designated by the Board of Directors. The Secretary shall have the duty to assure that notice is duly given of all meetings in accordance with the provisions of these bylaws or as required by law.

The Treasurer shall keep or cause to be kept full and accurate records of all receipts and disbursements in books of the Corporation and shall render to the Board of Directors, whenever requested, an account of the financial condition of the Corporation.

## ARTICLE IV. INDEMNIFICATION OF OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AND OTHERS

### Section 4.01 Nature of Indemnity.
Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a "proceeding"), by reason of the fact that he or she, or a person of whom he or she is the legal representative, is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee, fiduciary, or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (specifically including employee benefit plans), shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent not prohibited by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than said law permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment) against all expenses, liability, loss (including attorneys' fees actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such proceeding), judgments, fines (specifically including any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to an employee benefit plan) and amounts paid in settlement, except for any claim based on an act or omission involving intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law or from which such person derived an improper personal pecuniary benefit. Such indemnification shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and administrators. Except as provided in Section
4.02 hereof, the Corporation shall indemnify any such person seeking indemnification in connection with a proceeding initiated by such person only if such proceeding was authorized by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.

### Section 4.02 Procedures for Indemnification of Directors and Officers.
Any indemnification of a director or officer of the Corporation under Section 4.01 or advance of expenses under Section 4.05 of this Article IV shall be made promptly, and in any event within thirty (30) days, upon the written request of the director or officer. If a determination by the Corporation that the director or officer is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article IV is required, and the Corporation fails to respond within thirty (30) days to a written request for indemnity, the Corporation shall be deemed to have approved the request. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required undertaking, if any, has been tendered to the Corporation) that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct for indemnification, but the burden of such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.

### Section 4.03 Article Not Exclusive.
The rights to indemnification and the payment of expenses incurred in defending a proceeding in advance of its final disposition conferred in this Article IV shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.

### Section 4.04 Insurance.
The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on its own behalf and on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee, fiduciary, or agent of the Corporation or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against him or her and incurred by him or her in any such capacity, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such liability under this Article IV.

### Section 4.05 Expenses.
Expenses incurred by any person described in Section 4.01 in defending a proceeding shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of such proceeding's final disposition upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the director or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he or she is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation. Such expenses incurred by other employees and agents may be so paid upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the Board of Directors deems appropriate.

### Section 4.06 Employees and Agents.
Persons who are not covered by the foregoing provisions of this Article IV and who are or were employees or agents of the Corporation, or who are or were serving at the request of the Corporation as employees or agents of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, may be indemnified to the extent authorized at any time or from time to time by the Board of Directors.

### Section 4.07 Contract Rights.
The provisions of this Article IV shall be deemed to be a contract right between the Corporation and each director or officer who serves in any such capacity at any time while this Article IV and the relevant provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware or other applicable law are in effect, and any repeal or modification of this Article IV or any such law shall not affect any rights or obligations then existing with respect to any state of facts or proceeding then existing.

### Section 4.08 Merger or Consolidation.
For purposes of this Article IV, references to the "Corporation" shall include, in addition to the resulting corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors, officers, and employees or agents, so that any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of such constituent corporation, or is or was serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under this Article IV with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as he or she would have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued.

## ARTICLE V. STOCK CERTIFICATES

### Section 5.01 Certificates.
The shares of stock of the Corporation shall be represented by certificates; provided that the Board of Directors may provide by resolution or resolutions that some or all of any class or series shall be uncertificated shares that may be evidenced by a book-entry system maintained by the registrar of such stock. If shares are represented by certificates, such certificates shall be signed by, or in the name of, the Corporation by the President and by the Secretary or Treasurer. However, holders of unvested shares of capital stock of the Corporation shall not be entitled to such certificate until such holders shares have vested in full. Any of or all of the signatures on the certificate may be a facsimile. In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate shall have ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the Corporation with the same effect as if he were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue.

## ARTICLE VI. MISCELLANEOUS

### Section 6.01 Form of Records.
Any records maintained by the Corporation in the regular course of its business, including its stock ledger, books of account and minute books, may be kept on, or be in the form of, punch cards, magnetic tape, photographs, microphotographs or any other information storage device, provided that the records so kept can be converged into clearly legible form within a reasonable time. The Corporation shall so convert any records so kept upon the request of any person entitled to inspect the same.

### Section 6.02 Fiscal Year.
The fiscal year of the Corporation shall be the calendar year, unless otherwise determined by the Board of Directors.

### Section 6.03 Checks, Notes, Drafts, Etc.
All checks, notes, drafts or other orders for the payment of money of the Corporation shall be signed, endorsed or accepted in the name of the Corporation by such officer, officers, person or persons as from time to time may be designated by the Board of Directors or by an officer or officers authorized by the Board of Directors to make such designation.
### Section 6.04 Conflict With Applicable Law or Certificate of Incorporation.
These by-laws are adopted subject to any applicable law and the Certificate of Incorporation. Whenever these by-laws may conflict with any applicable law or the Certificate of Incorporation, such conflict shall be resolved in favor of such law or the Certificate of Incorporation.

### Section 6.05 Amendment of Bylaws.
These bylaws may be amended or repealed, and new bylaws adopted, by the Board of Directors, but the stockholders entitled to vote may adopt additional bylaws and may amend or repeal any by-law whether or not adopted by them.
