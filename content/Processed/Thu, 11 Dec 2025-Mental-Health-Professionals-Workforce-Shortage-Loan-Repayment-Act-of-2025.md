## Summary
This bill aims to address the mental health professional workforce shortage by creating a loan repayment program. It likely incentivizes mental health professionals to work in underserved areas or high-need settings by offering student loan relief.

## Startup Angle
A telehealth mental health platform that helps providers qualify for loan repayment could benefit from this policy. Companies like Lyra Health or Talkspace might see increased provider recruitment opportunities, as the bill could make mental health roles more financially attractive. A startup could also develop a SaaS platform to help mental health professionals navigate loan repayment requirements and track their eligibility.
