### Partnership Opportunity at NYP

- Josh Faber developing accelerated startup pilot program at New York-Presbyterian
- Problem: Current pilot process takes 2-3 years, killing promising pre-seed/seed companies with 18-month runway
- Solution: VC-health system partnership to streamline deployment, data access, evaluation infrastructure
	- Northwestern model with Techstars as reference
	- Josh has C-suite buy-in at NYP including CIOs, CMIOs across both campuses
- Target companies: Pre-seed/seed stage (10 people or fewer, six figures in bank)
	- Focus on proving product works vs Series A companies who already have customers
- Timeline: 12-18 months for full implementation
	- Initial proposal to CIOs/CMIOs in coming months
	- Final approval through Chief Transformation Officer (OG Silverman Fellow)

### Virtue Portfolio Alignment

- Three potential candidates identified:
	- Standard Model: Multimodal foundation models for biopharma monetization while driving health system operational improvements
	- Translucent FPNA: AI for healthcare operators (ASC, cardiology service lines) to eliminate Excel-based business management
	- Health [stealth]: Co-development platform with 100+ use cases, Palantir-style for healthcare
- SmartDX success story as validation (most successful healthcare AI exit, real ROI vs paper valuation)
- Previous connections: Translucent in conversations with Presbyterian

### Next Steps

- Josh to send partnership opportunity blurb to Emre
- Emre to introduce Josh to relevant portfolio founders
- Emre to identify other interested VCs (geography less important than portfolio quality)
- Potential event format: Panel with 3 CEOs showcasing innovation at Presbyterian
- Follow-up meeting when Josh returns from vacation in November
