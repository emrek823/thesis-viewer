## Summary
This FDA guidance provides detailed recommendations for sponsors on safety reporting requirements during investigational drug and bioavailability studies. It clarifies the responsibilities and compliance standards for documenting and assessing safety events in clinical research.

The guidance creates demand for platforms that can systematically track, validate, and expedite adverse event reporting while ensuring regulatory compliance. Specifically, companies like Medrio, Medscape, or new entrants could develop AI-enhanced safety monitoring tools that help sponsors quickly identify and escalate safety signals in real-time clinical research.
