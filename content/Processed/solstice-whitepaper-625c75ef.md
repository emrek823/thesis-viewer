# Case Study: How Maryland Oncology Hematology Reduced Their Patient Chart Preparation Time By 87.5%

## Using Solstice Health's Platform Elevated the Work of Practice Administrative Staff

### THE CHALLENGE OF RETRIEVING MEDICAL RECORDS

Retrieving medical records for new and returning patients is an eternal challenge for community oncology practices due to the lack of interoperability between healthcare systems, the volume and diversity of care oncology patients receive, and the difficulties in recollecting year-long care journeys. Practices generally staff multiple administrative personnel to manually contact their patient's prior health providers and retrieve medical records, often resorting to archaic methods such as fax. This process represents a crucial component of the patient intake process but consumes valuable time and results in the retrieval of an incomplete and unorganized set of records for a given patient. Clinicians then spend hours reviewing these documents daily and risk missing valuable information that could be essential for a patient's care.

### HOW INTEGRATING SOLSTICE IMPROVED MARYLAND ONCOLOGY'S PATIENT INTAKE PROCESS

Solstice Health worked with Maryland Oncology Hematology (MOH) to simplify their medical record retrieval process.¹ It aimed to improve outcomes for patients by saving both clinician and administrative staff time and enhancing the quality of information clinicians had available to them prior to providing care. Instead of requiring administrative staff to spend hours sending fax requests and reading through pages of poorly formatted documentation, Solstice connected the practice with with two major nationwide data interoperability networks, CommonWell Health Alliance and eHealth Exchange. They then used their proprietary software to structure queried information in order to create curated patient clinical summary reports for their clinicians to review prior to their patients' appointments.

A retrospective review was conducted of 70 patients for which Solstice created reports of their prior medical histories and for which MOH administrative staff manually retrieved medical records. For these 70 patients, the information stored within MOH's electronic health record (EHR) system was compared with the information Solstice retrieved to contrast the breadth and relevance of information. In addition, the time required for Solstice's software to create summarized reports of a patients' prior medical history was compared with the time it took MOH's team to find and filter the same cohort of patient's records through a timed study. All information provided through Solstice's reports were validated with an oncologist at MOH to ensure their relevance in the provision of care.²

Solstice was able to find 3.1x more progress notes (p < 0.0098), 1.7x more pathology/operative reports (p < 0.006), 1.3x more radiology reports (p < 0.025), and 3.2x more laboratory tests (p < 1e-5) than MOH. The clinicians using this information to provide care noted that this additional information prevented the need to prescribe additional tests for patients, helped answer important questions, and decreased the time they spent searching for specific information before an appointment.

Beyond the differences in information retrieved, the time study conducted showed that, on average, the MOH team required 2 hours to aggregate and filter all a patient's prior medical history prior to uploading it to their EHR for the oncologist to review. Solstice's software required on average 15 minutes per patient to handle this process. Given that this process is required prior to every new patient intake appointment, Solstice saved the administrative team a combined 17.5 hours per day, equivalent to the work of 2.2 full-time employees per week. In other words, Solstice reduced their chart preparation time by 87.5% per patient.

### FUTURE IMPLICATIONS OF SOLSTICE

Solstice Health has set a new standard for the information available to community practices prior to their first encounters with patients. The increased accuracy and the quick turnaround of the medical records retrieval process also allow clinicians to see patients sooner and make more informed care decisions, translating to better patient outcomes. Furthermore, Solstice frees up the valuable time of their administrative staff to handle higher leverage tasks such as following up with patients and handling inquiries at the practice. As the program expands, Solstice will look to help MOH leverage the new breadth of information found on their patients to perform other vital functions at the clinic such as accurately calculate risk scores on patients for value-based contracts and identifying potential clinical trial matches.
