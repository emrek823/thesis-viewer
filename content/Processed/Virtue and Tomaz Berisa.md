### Tomaz Background & Company Vision

- Former GenCOV co-founder (8 years, through Series A)
	- Licensed low-pass sequencing tech from New York Genome Center
	- Key lesson: Human-related costs define hard cost floor for genomics
	- Even if sequencing were free, low-pass genome would still cost $20-30
- Current focus: Lab automation using vision-language-action models
	- Problem: Society not trending toward fractions-of-pennies sequencing costs needed for acceleration
	- Solution: AI robotics that can be told what to do, not how to do it
	- Analogy to LLMs transforming software engineering

### Market Analysis & Competitive Positioning

- GenCOV lessons learned: Running a lab isn’t a venture business because it doesn’t scale
- Market segmentation on two axes:
- Critique of current approaches:
	- Companies building lab cells/pods with person still in the loop
	- Wrong level of abstraction - need to automate whole lab, not individual components
- Wedge strategy: Start with established service lab interface
	- Samples and money in, data out
	- Focus on whole genome sequencing (large, well-understood market)
	- Current market pricing: $300-400 vs theoretical $100 genome

### Technology & Development

- Physical Intelligence - generalist AI inspiration
	- Love those folks - very open with their work and publish models open-source
	- Started with imitation learning, now adding RL (reinforcement learning)
	- Can download their models and build on foundation
- Current setup:
	- Left GenCOV in May 2024
	- Team of 2 (Tomaz + Jahan, former GenCOV lab director)
	- Received initial funding from SOSV, moved into lab space 2 weeks ago
	- Robots arrived a week ago, now training them
- Company rule: No touching lab equipment with hands, only through robots

### Funding & Business Model

- Raising $1.6M total, $1.3M remaining to close
- SOSV safe structure, flexible timing
- Target customers: $50-500K annual spend
	- Biotechs, biobanks, pharma teams
	- Medium-sized academic (serious research teams, not 3-sample projects)
	- Decision-makers who can spend $100-200K without approval chains
- Long-term vision: “Amazon bookstore” approach
	- Build boring service lab first, develop underlying infrastructure
	- Potential evolution to cloud labs, OEM deployment, or discovery platform
	- Decision on final direction in 3-5 years based on market development
