## Slide 7: Georgia – EMS Call Volume
RIGHT SITE

In Q1, we reduced EMS A/M services due to concerns that call volume might outpace case rates. Although call volume decreased more than expected in Q1, it rebounded in Q2. Dispatch tends to have a higher audio vs video ratio (see page 10.)

**Monthly Activations - Rolling 13 Months** (Call Type: Audio vs Video)

| Month | Total Activations | Audio | Video |
|---|---|---|---|

## Slide 8: Georgia – Call Volume Growth Strategy
RIGHT SITE

RightSite's EMS Call Volume Growth Strategy has organic growth and new growth components.

**Organic Growth Strategies**

1.  **Transforming EMS Account Management**
    Current SME-led management has not met growth targets. We are implementing a sales-led model, hiring full-time, quota-driven sales reps supported by SMEs. The ADKAR Change Management framework will guide our focus on EMS agency-level activities.

2.  **Weekend Operations**
    EMS agencies have requested weekend operations, which could increase volume by 40% if weekend calls match weekdays. See Appendix 2 “Weekend Calculator.”

3.  **Increasing Dispatch Volume**
    Our Grady Dispatch implementation immediately increased call volume. While Dispatch requires less training than Field EMS, the quality of these calls (diversion rate and patient experience) is lower than in the field. We are developing tactics to reduce patient refusal rates just before Dispatch sends patients to RightSite, and improve diversion rates when patients accept our service. The significant Dispatch volume has led several agencies to consider adding Dispatch to their existing RightSite Field implementation.

4.  **Rural Services and Medical Director Services**
    Rural EMS agencies need RightSite to avoid non-emergent runs that take ambulances out of service. To attract these agencies, we offer medical direction services from ER physicians and have protocols for Dispatch and Field operations. Our EMS attorneys have approved this concept.

Confidential

## Slide 9: Georgia – Call Volume Growth Strategy
RIGHT SITE

**New Growth Strategies**

1.  **GA-Focused Formal EMS Sales Process**
    All GA EMS agency growth to date has been by word-of-mouth from our existing EMS agencies. The next step is to add a sales-led model, hiring quota-driven, in-market, full-time sales reps supported by SMEs. Once in place, we'll use community and agency ranking to prioritize which agencies can deliver high quality volume faster.

2.  **GA-Focused EMS Marketing Program**
    We've done no systematic or coordinated marketing to date. With a sales leader in place, we'll actively manage basic marketing programs from social media and SEO work to targeted activities like conferences, CME classes, and government relations work will enhance a formal sales process.

3.  **GA DCH Medicaid Awards**
    Georgia DCH will be announcing the RFP awards imminently, and it's certain to be contested. However, RightSite is written in to ALL major Medicaid Plan submissions except Molina, which should convert our current mix of 11% Medicaid FFS where we are only paid for FFS, to Managed Medicaid Plans where we should also receive Case Rates, which is not reflected in our current financial model.

Confidential

## Slide 10: Georgia – Dispatch Diversion Rates
RIGHT SITE

**Dispatch Diversion Rates**

Grady Dispatch's starting diversion rate is 41%, lower than expected and below the SAFD dispatch rate of 59% and field medics' 72%. SAFD dispatch staffs only with paramedic call takers, but Grady uses non-clinical civilian call takers, which is how most dispatch centers across the country staff.

| EMS Type | Diversion Rate |
|---|---|
| All Field | 72% |
| SAFD Dispatch | 59% |
| Grady Dispatch | 41% |

**Increasing Dispatch Diversion Rates**

We are working with Grady on strategies to improve dispatch diversion rates we can use for all dispatch implementations. For example, Grady dispatch currently has a higher ratio of audio to video activations, but audio activations have lower diversion rates. We are experimenting with ways to convert more dispatch activations to video.

**Monthly Activations** (Call Type: Audio vs Video, Mar 2024 - Jul 2024)
Chart Data:

| Month | Total Activations | Audio | Video |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mar 2024 | 299 | 268 | 31 |

| May 2024 | 543 | 404 | 139 |

## Slide 11: Payor Mix Dynamics
RIGHT SITE

The Payor mix changes over time. These changes significantly impact our BCR and financial model calculations.

For example, most payors have been stable since Jul-23, except:
*   Medicaid FFS increased from 9% to 19%, then to 10%
*   United decreased from 13% to 10%, then to 21%

**Changing Payor Mix LTM**
Chart Data (Approximate percentages from bar chart):

| Payor | Jul-23 | Jan-24 | May-24 | Jun-24 | Jul-24 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Medicaid FFS | ~9% | ~19% | ~17% | ~13% | ~10% |
| Medicare FFS | ~18% | ~10% | ~11% | ~12% | ~10% |

## Slide 12: Georgia Blended Contract Rate – GA
RIGHT SITE

This is the forecast GA BCR progression using the weighted rates of the Jul-24 payor mix:

| | Est Case Rate | Existing FFS | Est BCR Contribution | BCR |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **BCR Q2:24** | | | | **$168** |
| Aetna (enterprise) | $915 | $14 | $78 | $246 |
| Caresource (enterprise) | $525 | $4 | $20 | $266 |
| Humana (enterprise) | $800\* | $12 | $60 | $326 |
| United | $700 | $41 | $188 | $514 |

\* See Humana note below

On Friday, 8/2, Humana offered to sign an interim contract rate to allow more time to analyze dispatch diversion rates. Their offer is:
*   $150 for Telehealth
*   $700 for Field diversion
*   $250 provisional for Dispatch diversion
*   RightSite and Humana will work to establish a $700 diversion case rate through analysis. We believe Humana misinterpreted dispatch results from a national EMS data set they obtained.
*   If Humana does not complete a mutually agreed-upon analysis within 45 days, the rate will revert to $700

## Slide 15: Texas Market Review
RIGHT SITE

### What Happened
**Performance**
*   2,029 total activations (avg ~10 calls/day)
*   59% diversion rate
*   RightSite provided 893 rideshare services to 523 patients (avg 1.7 rideshares/patient).
*   SAFD saved $1.7M in avoided ambulance runs.

### What's Next
**Expansion**
*   Open weekends once call volume exceeds 30/day, which should add a stair-step of 40% more calls.
*   Expand to SAFD Field and MIH post-RFP award with the City of San Antonio. The City rejected SAFD's sole-source request, but we expect to win the RFP in Q3, triggering Field and MIH expansion.
*   The SAFD award will also open expansion opportunities to 37 other EMS agencies sharing services with SAFD.
*   We will hire one EMS sales and a/m employee in D/FW. Our growing TX BCR supports it, and D/FW has high concentrations of Aetna Medicaid members whose case rate is $1,000, whether or not diverted.

### Challenges
*   As we saw across many existing clients, SAFD dispatch call volume was flat this quarter. With a sales-oriented EMS a/m process, call volume should grow again.

## Slide 16: Florida Market Review
RIGHT SITE

### What Happened
**JFRD agrees to re-launch in dispatch**
**Site Visit to ATL**
*   AFRD and Grady hosted JFRD leadership for an on-site visit, convincing them to re-launch in their dispatch rather than re-train field paramedics, where adoption has been slow
**Contract with the City of Jacksonville**
*   We converted our pilot contract with the City of Jacksonville to a multi-year sole-source agreement, reinforcing JFRD's commitment and serving as a reference for other Florida communities contracting with RightSite

### What's Next
*   JFRD has agreed to re-launch in dispatch and, once successful, re-train the field. Launching in dispatch should solve many of the barriers we've experienced in the field. They are restructuring dispatch now to implement RightSite processes, expecting to be ready for a late Q3 implementation.
*   Outreach from Palm Beach Fire/EMS
*   Fast-follow contracting opportunity with Aetna, Centene, and Humana

### Challenges
*   We have developed enough experience to understand that JFRD has a "late adopter" profile. Their hurdles are likely solvable, but like any late adopter, they take more time

## Slide 17: Care Team – Performance and Cost
RIGHT SITE

### What Happened
**Current Episode Throughput**
*   Navigators manage 0.7 episodes/hour; Physicians manage 2.6 episodes/hour.
**Optimization and Compliance**
*   We track and measure episode throughput to improve KPIs, episode management, insurance identification, and RCM integration.

### What's Next
**Strategies for Improvement**
*   Q3 goal is for Navigators to manage 1.0 episodes/hour and Physicians to manage 3.0 episodes/hour.
*   Consider adding ER scribes to increase throughput by assisting with documentation, insurance verification, and RCM accuracy.
*   Adding CHW certification to the hiring profile for Navigators.

### Challenges
*   Physician surge staffing model is still being developed.

## Slide 18: Revenue Cycle
RIGHT SITE

### What Happened
**Accomplishments**
*   Signed 15 FFS contracts and 1 case rate contract
*   CareSource agrees to retro case rate retro billing to Jan 1 when signed
*   Credentialed all but 1 physician (GA Medicaid enrollment pending) in all 3 states
*   Initiated billing system conversion for better RCM management
*   All claims submitted for billing as of June 30 (dropped to carriers on July 15)

### What's Next
**Q3 Goals**
*   Ensure billing system conversion remains on track for Sept 1 go-live
*   All physicians credentialed by all payors in FL, GA, TX
*   1 new physician to be credentialed in all 3 states with all payors
*   Submit claims weekly
*   Prepare for Foundation invoicing
*   Enhance claims reporting

### Challenges
*   Current billing system is clunky
*   Billing system conversion is always a risk

## Slide 19: Foundation
RIGHT SITE

### What Happened
**Monthly Invoicing and Cost Estimate**
*   The Foundation will receive detailed monthly invoices for up to $175 per episode for uninsured care covering telehealth, urgent care, transportation, Rx, and other out-of-pocket expenses
**Foundation Activities**
*   Launched Foundation website - [LINK](https://www.rightsite.org/foundation)
*   Achieved Platinum Guidestar status. Guidestar is the "must-have" certification for 501(c)(3)s non-profits, and is essentially required by philanthropic donors. Platinum is Guidestar's highest status level.

### What's Next
**Q3 Goals**
*   Finalizing promotional materials for Foundation fundraising
*   Developing donor strategies for GA and TX
*   Hiring an Executive Director
*   Expanding the Board of Directors and Advisory Board

### Challenges
*   Fundraising for nonprofits like the RightSite Foundation that are less than a year old can be difficult.

1.  vs. Seed Extension model

### MD&A
Through Jun-24, cash realized a negative variance of ~ $365K, due to:
1.  RCM claim process refined in Q2 resulting in delayed claim submission
2.  Timing-related factors in Operating expenses: 1 time/annual payments, primarily insurance-related + three payroll periods that occurred in Feb-24 (RightSite payroll occurs every other week)
3.  Sales/Marketing/Gov't Relations had a negative variance primarily due to M&M (payor advisors) + City of Jacksonville negotiations
4.  Dividend Income was negatively impacted by the timing of the institutional closing (1/31) and the F&F closing (3/18) relative to the model timing

## Slide 25: Series A - Discussion
RIGHT SITE

**Rationale for Series A**
*   **Proven Clinical Model:** RightSite's clinical model works, proven by over 5,000 episodes with 65% diversions
*   **Revenue Model Success:** The FFS + Case Rate model is adding health plan contracts as we offer them:
    *   Measurable, immediate improvement of MLR
    *   No added risk
    *   No upfront cost
*   **Operational Efficiency:** The Care Team process is being 'LEANed' out to improve efficiency and should yield an increased contribution margin
*   **Call Volume Growth Strategy:** Implementing a sales-led team to boost both organic EMS call volume and net-new EMS partners
*   **Tech-Enabled Service Platform:** Adding more engineers to their skeleton team will speed up RightSite Connect development, boosting Care Team and revenue cycle efficiency
*   **Risk Management:** No meaningful regulatory or market risks
*   **Competitive Risk:** No current meaningful competitive threats

**Growth Strategy**
*   **Target States:** Focus on Georgia, Texas, and Florida, with a $1.1B TAM, and penetrate $110M SAM
*   **Payor Contracting:** Use a 'fast follower' approach for case rates using GA-executed contracts
*   **Licensing/Credentialing:** Complete physician licensing and credentialing for all providers (except new hires) in all states
*   **Expansion Plans:** Formalize sales and marketing plans in existing states to reduce execution risk before entering new states
*   **Future Expansion:** Assess new states closer to Series B

**Recommendation**
*   **Series A Financing Round Size: $12-15M**
    *   $5.2M for strategic hires (see next page)
    *   $8-10M for working capital to drive marketing and government relations, enhance R&D, support operations, manage cash flow, and mitigate risks to achieve our growth milestones.

## Slide 29: Weekend Calculator
RIGHT SITE

This calculator estimates the optimal time to open weekends in a market. For Atlanta, using these assumptions:
*   Diversion rate: 54%
*   Uninsured rate: 20%
*   3 navigators

Opening weekends with 31 calls/day and a BCR of $300 would generate a positive gross margin.
