# RUPA, INC.
## Restricted Stock Purchase Agreement

This Restricted Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Agreement”) is made as of January 28, 2019 by and between Rupa, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”) and Tara Viswanathan (the “Purchaser”). In consideration of the mutual covenants and representations set forth below, the Company and the Purchaser agree as follows:

### 1. Sale of Stock.
Subject to the terms of this Agreement and upon the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the parties or on such other date as the Company and Purchaser shall agree (the “Purchase Date”), the Company will issue and sell to Purchaser, and Purchaser agrees to purchase from the Company, 1,950,000 shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock (the “Shares”) at a purchase price of $.00001 per share (“Per Share Price”), which aggregates to a total purchase price of $19.50 (the "Aggregate Purchase Price”). In consideration for the purchase of the Shares hereunder, the Purchaser (A) shall deliver a check in an amount equal to the Aggregate Purchase Price to the Company (the “Check”) on the Purchase Date, and (B) hereby with the execution of this Agreement transfers and assigns to the Company any and all right, title, and interest the Purchaser now has or may ever have in the Company's business and any Intellectual Property (as defined below) related to the Company's business, as currently conducted and as may be conducted in the future. For purposes hereof, “Intellectual Property” means: (a) United States and foreign patents, trademarks, copyrights and mask works, including all associated registrations and applications, and rights granted upon any reissue, division, continuation or continuation-in-part thereof, (b) trade secret rights arising out of the laws of any and all jurisdictions, (c) ideas, business plans, inventions, concepts, technology, software, methods, processes, drawings, illustrations, writings, know-how, trade names, domain names, web addresses and web sites, and all rights therein and thereto, (d) any other intellectual property rights, whether or not registrable, and (e) licenses in or to any of the foregoing.

### 2. Closing.
On the Purchase Date, the Purchaser will deliver to the Company the Check and an executed copy of this Agreement, and the Company will enter the Shares in Purchaser's name in the books and records of the Company or, if applicable, with a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company. The Company will deliver to Purchaser, upon request, a notice of issuance of the Shares as soon as practicable following the Purchase Date. The term “Shares” refers to all of the Shares purchased hereunder, all securities received in connection with the Shares pursuant to stock dividends or splits, all securities received in replacement of the Shares in a recapitalization, merger, reorganization, exchange or the like, and all new, substituted or additional securities or other property to which Purchaser is entitled by reason of Purchaser's ownership of the Shares.

### 3. Intellectual Property.

#### A. Transfer Assistance.
Purchaser agrees to take all actions reasonably requested by the Company to assist the Company in effecting the transfer of the Intellectual Property assigned hereunder, and in establishing, perfecting, defending, enforcing and protecting the Company's rights in any of the Intellectual Property transferred hereunder, including without limitation assisting in the prosecution of any patent applications included in or based upon such Intellectual Property. In the event the Company is unable for any reason, after reasonable effort, to secure Purchaser's signature on any document needed in connection with the actions specified in this Section 3.A, Purchaser irrevocably designates and appoints the Company and its duly authorized officers and agents as Purchaser's agent and attorney in fact, which appointment is coupled with an interest, to act for and on behalf of Purchaser to execute, verify and file any such documents and to do all other lawfully permitted acts to further the purposes of this Section with the same legal force and effect as if executed by Purchaser.

#### B. Purchaser Intellectual Property Representations and Warranties.
Purchaser represents and warrants that except for Intellectual Property assigned under this Agreement or any other agreement between the Purchaser and the Company, the Purchaser possesses no Intellectual Property and has made no Intellectual Property related to the Company's business, as currently conducted or as proposed to be conducted. Purchaser further represents and warrants that, to the best of Purchaser's knowledge, (i) Purchaser will not breach or violate any agreement of any kind by performing under or entering into this Agreement; (ii) Purchaser has full right and power to enter into and perform this Agreement without the consent of any third party; (iii) to the extent assigned hereunder, the Intellectual Property is free and clear of all claims, liens and encumbrances; (iv) there have been no claims or conflicts concerning whether the Intellectual Property assigned hereunder violates any third party's rights; and (v) none of the Intellectual Property assigned hereunder infringes, conflicts with, or violates any third party's patent or other intellectual property right of any kind.

#### C. Additional Intellectual Property.
Purchaser agrees that to the extent it is discovered that Purchaser has made or possesses rights to any Intellectual Property related to the Company's business that is not properly assigned to the Company hereunder or through any other agreement between the Purchaser and the Company (the “Additional Intellectual Property”), the Additional Intellectual Property is hereby assigned to the Company and shall be considered, for the purposes of this Agreement, to be “Intellectual Property”. Purchaser agrees to assist the Company in every proper way to obtain, and from time to time enforce, United States and foreign proprietary rights relating to the Additional Intellectual Property in any and all countries. Purchaser agrees to execute, verify and deliver such documents and perform such other acts (including appearances as a witness) as the Company may reasonably request for use in applying for, obtaining, perfecting, evidencing, sustaining and enforcing such Additional Intellectual Property and the assignment of such Additional Intellectual Property.

#### D. Indemnification.
Purchaser will indemnify and hold harmless the Company, from any and all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, expenses and costs (including attorneys' fees and court costs) which result from a breach or alleged breach of any representation or warranty of Purchaser (a “Claim”) concerning the Intellectual Property, provided that the Company gives Purchaser written notice of any such Claim and Purchaser has the right to participate in the defense of any such Claim at Purchaser's expense.

### 4. Repurchase Option.

#### A. Option.
In the event the Purchaser ceases to be an employee, consultant, advisor, officer or director of the Company (a “Service Provider”) for any or no reason, including, without limitation, by reason of the Purchaser's death or disability, resignation or involuntary termination, the Company shall, from such date (the date on which Service Provider status ceases, the “Termination Date”), have an irrevocable, exclusive option for 90 days following the Termination Date to repurchase (the "Repurchase Option”) any Shares not released from the Repurchase Option as of the Termination Date (the “Unreleased Shares”), at a price per share equal to the lesser of (i) the fair market value of the Unreleased Shares at the time the Repurchase Option is exercised, as determined by the Company's Board of Directors (“Board”), or (ii) the Price Per Share (the “Repurchase Price”). The Company in its sole discretion may assign all or part of the Repurchase Option.

#### B. Exercise.
The Company may exercise its Repurchase Option as to any or all of the Unreleased Shares at any time within 90 days following the Termination Date; provided, however, that without requirement of further action on the part of the Company, the Repurchase Option shall be deemed to have been automatically exercised as to all Unreleased Shares at 5:00 p.m. (in the time zone of the jurisdiction in which the Company operates its principal place of business) 90 days after the Termination Date, unless the Company declines in writing to exercise its Repurchase Option prior to such time. If the Company decides not to exercise its Repurchase Option, it shall notify the Purchaser in writing within 90 days of the Termination Date. If the Repurchase Option is exercised or deemed exercised the Company shall deliver payment to the Purchaser, with a copy to the Escrow Agent (as defined in Section 9 hereof), by any of the following methods: (i) delivering to the Purchaser or the Purchaser's executor a check in the amount of the aggregate Repurchase Price, (ii) canceling an amount of the Purchaser's indebtedness to the Company equal to the aggregate Repurchase Price or (iii) any combination of (i) and (ii) such that the combined payment and cancellation of indebtedness equals the aggregate Repurchase Price.

#### C. Rights upon Exercise.
In the event that the Repurchase Option is exercised or deemed exercised, (i) Purchaser's sole right and remedy shall be to receive the Repurchase Price, (ii) in no case shall Purchaser have any claim of ownership as to any of the Unreleased Shares, (iii) the Company shall become the legal and beneficial owner of the Unreleased Shares, and shall have all related rights and interest in the Unreleased Shares, and (iv) the Company shall have the right to transfer the Unreleased Shares being repurchased to its own name or a third party, without further action by Purchaser.

#### D. Change of Control.
In the event of Change of Control (as defined below) then the Repurchase Option shall be assigned by the Company to any successor of the Company (or the successor's parent) in connection with such Change of Control. To the extent that the Repurchase Option remains in effect following such a Change of Control, it shall apply to the new property received in exchange for Unreleased Shares at the consummation of the Change of Control. The per share Repurchase Price with respect to the Repurchase Option shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect the effect of the Change of Control upon the capital structure of the Company; provided, however, that the aggregate Repurchase Price of all Unreleased Shares exchanged at the consummation of the Change of Control shall not be adjusted. For the purposes of this Agreement, “Change of Control” means (i) the acquisition of the Company by another entity by means of any transaction or series of related transactions (including, without limitation, any reorganization, merger or consolidation or stock transfer, but excluding any such transaction effected primarily for the purpose of changing the domicile of the Company), unless the Company's stockholders of record immediately prior to such transaction or series of related transactions hold, immediately after such transaction or series of related transactions, at least 50% of the voting power of the surviving or acquiring entity (provided that the sale by the Company of its securities for the purposes of raising additional funds shall not constitute a Change of Control hereunder); or (ii) a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company.

#### E. Adjustments.
If, at any time while the Purchaser holds Unreleased Shares, there is any change affecting the Company's outstanding Class A Common Stock as a class that is effected without the receipt of consideration by the Company, then any new, substituted or additional securities or other property to which Purchaser is entitled by reason of Purchaser's ownership of Unreleased Shares shall be immediately subject to the Repurchase Option and be included in the meaning of “Unreleased Shares" for all purposes of the Repurchase Option. While the aggregate Repurchase Price of the Unreleased Shares at the time of such foregoing event shall remain unadjusted, the Repurchase Price per share of the Unreleased Shares shall be appropriately adjusted.

### 5. Release of Shares from Repurchase Option; Vesting.
100% of the Shares shall be subject to the Repurchase Option (“Subject Shares”). The Subject Shares shall be released from the Repurchase Option in accordance with the Release Schedule attached here to as Appendix A. Subject to Section 9 below, the certificate, if any, representing the Shares which have been released from the Company's Repurchase Option shall be delivered to the Purchaser at the Purchaser's request.

### 6. Limitation on Payments.
If any severance and other benefits provided for in this Agreement or otherwise payable to the Purchaser (A) constitute “parachute payments” within the meaning of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and (B) would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (the “Excise Tax”), then Purchaser's benefits under this Agreement shall be (1) delivered in full, or (2) delivered in the maximum amount that would not subject the Purchaser to the Excise Tax, whichever amount results in the greatest after-tax amount to Purchaser. Any reduction in payments and/or benefits required by this Section 6 will apply first to cash payments, then to a reduction of vesting acceleration of equity awards, and then to other benefits paid or provided to Purchaser. Any reduction of vesting acceleration of equity awards will be applied in reverse order of the date of grant of Purchaser's equity awards. If two or more equity awards are granted on the same date, each award will be reduced on a pro-rata basis. An accounting firm selected by the Company (“Accounting Firm”) shall make all determinations with respect to any payments subject to this Section 6, and in no event will Purchaser exercise any discretion with respect to the ordering of any reductions of payments or benefits under this Section 6 Unless the Company and the Purchaser otherwise agree in writing, any determination required under this Section 6 shall be at the expense of the Company and made in writing by the Accounting Firm, whose determination shall be conclusive and binding upon Purchaser and the Company for all purposes.

### 7. Restrictions on Transfer

#### A. Acknowledgement Of Transfer Restrictions.
The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the Shares purchased under this Agreement are subject to certain restrictions on transfer, such as (i) the terms and conditions that apply to shares of the common stock of the Company ("Common Stock”), as set forth in the Company's Bylaws, including (without limitation) certain transfer restrictions set forth in Section 8.9 of the Company's Bylaws, as may be in effect at the time of any proposed transfer (the “Bylaw Provisions”), (ii) the Repurchase Option set forth herein, (iii) the lock-up period described in Section 7.E below, and (iv) applicable state and federal securities laws and regulations.

#### B. Legend Requirements.
The Purchaser understands and agrees that the Company shall cause the legends set forth below, or substantially equivalent legends, to be placed upon any certificate(s) evidencing ownership of the Shares, together with any other legends that may be required by the Company or by applicable state or federal securities laws:

THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED HEREBY HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 (THE “ACT”) AND MAY NOT BE OFFERED, SOLD OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED, PLEDGED OR HYPOTHECATED UNLESS AND UNTIL REGISTERED UNDER THE ACT OR, IN THE OPINION OF COUNSEL SATISFACTORY TO THE ISSUER OF THESE SECURITIES, SUCH OFFER, SALE OR TRANSFER, PLEDGE OR HYPOTHECATION OTHERWISE COMPLIES WITH THE ACT.

THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER AS SET FORTH IN THE SECTION 8.9 OF THE COMPANY'S BYLAWS, A RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL, A LOCK-UP PERIOD IN THE EVENT OF A PUBLIC OFFERING AND A REPURCHASE OPTION HELD BY THE ISSUER OR ITS ASSIGNEE(S) AS SET FORTH IN BYLAWS OF THE CORPORATION AND/OR THE RESTRICTED STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE ISSUER AND THE ORIGINAL HOLDER OF THESE SHARES, A COPY OF WHICH MAY BE OBTAINED AT THE PRINCIPAL OFFICE OF THE ISSUER. SUCH TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS, RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL, LOCK-UP PERIOD AND REPURCHASE OPTION ARE BINDING ON TRANSFEREES OF THESE SHARES.

#### C. Stop-Transfer Notices.
The Purchaser agrees that the Company may issue appropriate "stop transfer” instructions to its transfer agent, if any, to ensure compliance with the restrictions referred to herein; and, if the Company transfers its own securities, it may make appropriate notations to the same effect in its own records.

#### D. Refusal to Transfer.
The Company shall not be required (i) to transfer on its books any Shares that have been sold or otherwise transferred in violation of any of the provisions of this Agreement or (ii) to treat as owner of such Shares or to accord the right to vote or pay dividends to any purchaser or other transferee to whom such Shares shall have been so transferred.

#### E. Lock-Up Period.
If so requested by the Company or the underwriters in connection with the initial public offering of the Company's securities registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Purchaser shall not sell, make any short sale of, loan, grant any option for the purchase of, or otherwise dispose of any securities of the Company however or whenever acquired (except for those being registered) without the prior written consent of the Company or such underwriters, as the case may be, for 180 days from the effective date of the registration statement, plus such additional period, to the extent required by FINRA rules, up to a maximum of 216 days from the effective date of the registration statement, and Purchaser shall execute an agreement reflecting the foregoing as may be requested by the underwriters at the time of such offering.

#### F. Unreleased and Released Shares.
No Unreleased Shares subject to the Repurchase Option contained in Section 4 of this Agreement, nor any beneficial interest in such Unreleased Shares, shall be sold, gifted, transferred, encumbered or otherwise disposed of in any way (whether by operation of law or otherwise) by the Purchaser, other than as expressly permitted or required by Section 4. No Shares purchased pursuant to this Agreement, nor any beneficial interest in such Shares, shall be sold, transferred, encumbered or otherwise disposed of in any way (whether by operation of law or otherwise) by the Purchaser or any subsequent transferee, other than in compliance with the Bylaw Provisions and the Company's right of first refusal contained in Section 8 of this Agreement.

### 8. Company's Right of First Refusal.
Before any Shares acquired by the Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement (or any beneficial interest in such Shares) may be sold, transferred, encumbered or otherwise disposed of in any way (whether by operation of law or otherwise) by the Purchaser or any subsequent transferee (each a “Holder”), such Holder must first offer such Shares or beneficial interest to the Company and/or its assignee(s) as follows:

#### A. Notice of Proposed Transfer.
The Holder shall deliver to the Company a written notice stating: (i) the Holder's bona fide intention to sell or otherwise transfer the Shares; (ii) the name of each proposed transferee; (iii) the number of Shares to be transferred to each proposed transferee; (iv) the bona fide cash price or other consideration for which the Holder proposes to transfer the Shares; and (v) that by delivering the notice, the Holder offers all such Shares to the Company and/or its assignee(s) pursuant to this Section and on the same terms described in the notice.

#### B. Exercise of Right of First Refusal.
At any time within 30 days after receipt of the Holder's notice, the Company and/or its assignee(s) may, by giving written notice to the Holder, elect to purchase all, but not less than all, of the Shares proposed to be transferred to any one or more of the proposed transferees, at the purchase price listed in the Holder's notice. If the price listed in the Holder's notice includes consideration other than cash, the cash equivalent value of the non-cash consideration shall be determined by the Board of the Company in its sole discretion. Payment of the purchase price shall be made, at the option of the Company and/or its assignee(s), in cash (by check), by cancellation of all or a portion of any outstanding indebtedness of the Holder to the Company and/or its assignee(s), or by any combination thereof within 30 days after receipt by the Company of the Holder's notice (or at such later date as is called for by such notice).

#### C. Holder's Right to Transfer.
If all of the Shares proposed in the notice to be transferred to a proposed transferee are not purchased by the Company and/or its assignee(s) as provided in this Section, then the Holder may sell or otherwise transfer such Shares to that proposed transferee; provided that: (i) the transfer is made only on the terms provided for in the notice (except that the purchase price may be higher than as stated in the notice); (ii) such transfer is consummated within 60 days of the date the notice was delivered to the Company (“Notice Date”); (iii) the transfer is effected in accordance with any applicable securities laws, and if requested by the Company, the Holder shall have delivered an attorney's opinion acceptable to the Company to that effect; and (iv) the proposed transferee agrees in writing that the Shares will be subject to all provisions of this Agreement, including the terms of this Section. If a proposed transfer of Shares is not consummated within 60 days of the Notice Date, then before any transfer of Shares, a new notice shall be delivered to the Company and/or its assignees, and they shall again be offered the right of first refusal described in this Section.

#### D. Exception for Certain Family Transfers.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section, the transfer of any or all of the Shares during Holder's lifetime or on Holder's death by will or intestacy to Holder's Immediate Family or a trust for the benefit of Holder or Holder's Immediate Family shall be exempt from the provisions of this Section. For the purpose of this Agreement, “Immediate Family” shall mean lineal descendant or antecedent, spouse (or spouse's antecedents), father, mother, brother or sister (or their descendants), stepchild (or their antecedents or descendants), aunt or uncle (or their antecedents or descendants), brother-in-law or sister-in-law (or their antecedents or descendants), and shall include adoptive relationships. In such case, the transferee or other recipient shall receive and hold the Shares subject to any transfer restrictions contained in the Company bylaws and this Agreement.

#### E. Termination of Right of First Refusal.
The right of first refusal contained in this Section shall terminate as to all Shares upon the earlier of: (i) the closing date of the first sale of Common Stock of the Company to the general public pursuant to a registration statement filed with and declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”), and (ii) the closing date of a Change of Control pursuant to which the holders of the outstanding voting securities of the Company receive securities of a class registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

### 9. Escrow.
To facilitate the provisions of Section 4 of this Agreement, the Purchaser agrees, immediately upon receipt of the certificate(s), if any, evidencing the Shares, to deliver such certificate(s), together with a stock power in the form of Exhibit A attached to this Agreement, executed by the Purchaser and by the Purchaser's spouse, if any (with the date and number of shares left blank), to the Secretary of the Company or to another designee of the Company (the “Escrow Agent"), who will hold such in escrow (“Escrow”). The Escrow Agent shall hold these documents and take all such actions and effectuate all such transfers and/or releases as are required in accordance with this Agreement. Subject to the terms hereof, the Purchaser shall have all the rights of a stockholder with respect to such Shares while they are held in escrow. If the Shares are converted to any other form such as new, substituted or additional securities or cash or other consideration to which the Purchaser is entitled by reason of the Purchaser's ownership of the Shares, such securities or cash shall immediately become subject to this escrow, deposited with the Escrow Agent and deemed “Shares” for purposes of this Agreement and the Company's Repurchase Option. Should any dispute arise concerning the Shares subject to the Escrow, Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the Escrow Agent shall remain in possession of the Shares until presented with a written agreement resolving such dispute signed by both the Company and the Purchaser. Purchaser agrees that: (A) the escrow of the Shares by Escrow Agent is coupled with an interest; (B) the Escrow Agent shall not be liable to any party hereof (or to any other party) with respect to any actions taken concerning the Escrow; and (C) following the Escrow Agent's resignation, the Board may appoint a new party to serve as the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent may rely upon any letter, notice or other document executed by any signature purported to be genuine, and may resign at any time. In any event, the Escrow contemplated by this Section 9 shall terminate when all Shares have been released from the Repurchase Option.

### 10. Tax Consequences.
The Purchaser has reviewed the federal, state, local and foreign tax consequences of this investment and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with Purchaser's own legal and tax advisors. The Purchaser is relying solely on such advisors and not on any statements or representations of the Company or any of its agents. The Purchaser understands that the Purchaser (and not the Company) shall be responsible for any tax liability that may arise as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Purchaser understands that, as of the date any restrictions on the Shares lapse, the difference between the purchase price for the Shares and the fair market value of the Shares may be taxed as ordinary income pursuant to Section 83 of the Code. In this context, “restriction” includes the right of the Company to buy back the Shares pursuant to the Repurchase Option. The Purchaser understands that the Purchaser may elect to be taxed at the time the Shares are purchased rather than when and as the Repurchase Option expires by filing an election under Section 83(b) of the Code with the IRS within 30 days from the date of purchase. The Purchaser agrees that Purchaser will execute and deliver to the Company with this executed Agreement a copy of the Acknowledgment and Statement of Decision Regarding Section 83(b) Election attached hereto as Exhibit B. The form for making this Section 83(b) election is attached to this Agreement as Exhibit C and the Purchaser (and not the Company) shall be solely responsible for appropriately filing such form, even if the Purchaser requests the Company to make this filing on the Purchaser's behalf.

### 11. Investment Representations

#### A.
Purchaser is aware of the Company's business affairs and financial condition and has acquired sufficient information about the Company to reach an informed and knowledgeable decision to acquire the Shares. Purchaser is purchasing the Shares for investment for Purchaser's own account only and not with any intent for resale in connection with any “distribution” thereof within the meaning of the Securities Act or under any applicable provision of state law. Purchaser does not have any present intention to transfer the Shares to any other person or entity.

#### B.
Purchaser understands that the Shares have not been registered under the Securities Act by reason of a specific exemption therefrom, which exemption depends upon, among other things, the bona fide nature of Purchaser's investment intent as expressed herein.

#### C.
Purchaser will offer, sell, pledge or otherwise transfer the Purchased Shares only pursuant to registration under the Securities Act or an available exemption and in accordance with all applicable state and foreign securities laws.

#### D.
Purchaser consents to the Company making a notation on its records or giving instructions to any transfer agent of the Company in order to implement the restrictions on transfer of the Securities set forth in this Section 11.

#### E.
Purchaser further acknowledges and understands that the securities must be held indefinitely unless they are subsequently registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from such registration is available. Purchaser further acknowledges and understands that the Company is under no obligation to register the securities.

#### F.
Purchaser is familiar with the provisions of Rule 144, promulgated under the Securities Act, which, permits limited public resale of “restricted securities” acquired, directly or indirectly, from the issuer of the securities (or from an affiliate of such issuer), in a non-public offering subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. Purchaser understands that the Company provides no assurances as to whether Purchaser will be able to resell any or all of the Shares pursuant to Rule 144, which rule requires, among other things, that the Company be subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, that resales of securities take place only after the holder of the Shares has held the Shares for certain specified time periods, and under certain circumstances, that resales of securities be limited in volume and take place only pursuant to brokered transactions. Notwithstanding this Section 11.F, Purchaser acknowledges and agrees to the restrictions set forth in Section 11.G below.

#### G.
Purchaser further understands that in the event all of the applicable requirements of Rule 144 are not satisfied, registration under the Securities Act, compliance with Regulation A, or some other registration exemption will be required; and that, notwithstanding the fact that Rule 144 is not exclusive, the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission has expressed its opinion that persons proposing to sell private placement securities other than in a registered offering and otherwise pursuant to Rule 144 will have a substantial burden of proof in establishing that an exemption from registration is available for such offers or sales, and that such persons and their respective brokers who participate in such transactions do so at their own risk.

#### H.
Purchaser represents that Purchaser is not subject to any of the “Bad Actor" disqualifications described in Rule 506(d)(1)(i) to (viii) under the Securities Act. Purchaser also agrees to notify the Company if Purchaser becomes subject to such disqualifications after the date hereof.

#### I.
Purchaser understands that Purchaser may suffer adverse tax consequences as a result of Purchaser's purchase or disposition of the Shares. Purchaser represents that Purchaser has consulted any tax consultants Purchaser deems advisable in connection with the purchase or disposition of the Shares and that Purchaser is not relying on the Company for any tax advice.

### 12. General Provisions

#### A. Governing Law.
The validity, interpretation, construction and performance of this Agreement, including all related acts and transactions and the rights and obligations of the parties shall be governed, construed, and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the state of Delaware, without giving effect to principles of conflicts of law. For purposes of litigating any dispute that may arise directly or indirectly from this Agreement, the parties hereby submit and consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state of Delaware and agree that any such litigation shall be conducted only in the courts located in Delaware.

#### D. Successors.
Any successor to the Company (whether direct or indirect and whether by purchase, merger, consolidation, liquidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the Company's business and/or assets shall assume the obligations under this Agreement and expressly agree to perform the obligations under this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent as the Company would be required to perform such obligations in the absence of a succession. For all purposes under this Agreement, the term “Company” shall include any successor to the Company's business and/or assets which executes and delivers an assumption agreement described in this Section or becomes bound by the terms of this Agreement by operation of law. Subject to the transfer restrictions set forth in this Agreement, this Agreement shall be binding upon the Purchaser and his or her heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns.

#### E. Assignment; Transfers.
Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, this Agreement, and any and all rights, duties and obligations hereunder, shall not be assigned, transferred, delegated or sublicensed by the Purchaser without the prior written consent of the Company. Any attempt by the Purchaser without such consent to assign, transfer, delegate or sublicense any rights, duties or obligations that arise under this Agreement shall be void. Except as set forth in this Agreement, any transfers in violation of any restriction upon transfer contained in any Section of this Agreement shall be void, unless such restriction is waived in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

#### F. Waiver.
Either party's failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement shall not in any way be construed as a waiver of any such provision, nor prevent that party from thereafter enforcing any other provision of this Agreement. The rights granted both parties hereunder are cumulative and shall not constitute a waiver of either party's right to assert any other legal remedy available to it.

#### G. Purchaser Investment Representations and Further Documents.
The Purchaser agrees upon request to execute any further documents or instruments necessary or reasonably desirable in the view of the Company to carry out the purposes or intent of this Agreement, including (but not limited to) the applicable exhibits and attachments to this Agreement.

#### H. Severability.
Should any provision of this Agreement be found to be illegal or unenforceable, the other provisions shall nevertheless remain effective and shall remain enforceable to the greatest extent permitted by law.

#### I. Rights as Stockholder.

Upon such transfer, the Purchaser shall have no further rights as a holder of the Shares so purchased except (in the case of a transfer to the Company) the right to receive payment for the Shares so purchased in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, and the Purchaser shall forthwith cause the certificate(s) evidencing the Shares so purchased to be surrendered to the Company for transfer or cancellation.

#### J. Adjustment for Stock Split.
All references to the number of Shares and the purchase price of the Shares in this Agreement shall be adjusted to reflect any stock split, stock dividend or other change in the Shares which may be made after the date of this Agreement.
