### Chamber’s Current Priorities

- Launch readiness mode focused on standing up care teams for transitions of care and GDMT with data exchange with providers
- Planning 10x care team growth over next 6 months
- Narrowly focused on closing core quality gaps and hitting engagement goals
- Preparing for full risk populations in 2026 - will expand to full care coordination and risk adjustment
- Working primarily with independent cardiac practices

### Revenue & Cost Optimization Strategy

- Independent cardiac practices operate on low percentage and absolute margins
- Small appetite for incremental gains since money goes directly to practice pockets
- Existing workflows create impediments to AI tool adoption:
	- Practices with offshore teams/older tech face more disruption
	- Need phased adoption based on practice readiness
- Risk-stratified approach to AI implementation:
	- Only hire staff for high risk tier and half of medium risk tier
	- Target 70% of transitions of care requiring no human outreach
	- Preserve human experience for high-risk tiers
	- Could achieve 50% savings on TOC team size

### Operational Innovations

- Fast opportunity analyses accelerating contract cycles
	- Avoiding “3 months of data hell due to 2 analysts can’t coordinate calendars”
	- Directly impacts sales cycle speed
- Converting contract engagement definitions into automated procedures:
	- Example: 3 phone calls over 3 different days at different times
	- Previously manual process at Cityblock
	- Translates to minimum PMPM for members
	- Creates fixed-cost engagement with predictable cash flow
- Moving toward straight margin opportunities with zero variable cost from AI

### Technology Integration Approach

- Automated caretaker and care summary tools could make EHR less critical
- Current prototyping with:
	- Hippocratic - voice AI bots
	- Bland - agentic solutions
	- Converting “dumb” to “smart” patient routing
	- AI-staffed hotline for patient education
- Market consolidation considerations:
	- Ambience/Abridge emerging as leaders for health systems
	- Suki dominant for practices
	- Concern about market consolidation vs EHR-like fragmentation
	- Strategy to be “big fish in small pond” with independent cardiologists

### Technology Vendor Landscape

- No clear winners yet in ambient scribe/note-taking space
- Focusing on heavily managed solutions over high customization
- Preference for solutions that don’t require technical staff to manage
- Current market very noisy with vendors using similar talking points
- Need for more proven outcomes and business case data
