**ZoomLogi**

**Job Title:** Founding Engineer

**Company Overview:**
At ZoomLogi, we're on a mission to redefine visibility in pharmaceutical logistics. Every year, $35 billion worth of life-saving medicines and vaccines are wasted due to failures in temperature-controlled logistics – failures that impact millions of lives. With real-time data aggregation, predictive recommendations, and rapid interventions, we're transforming the pharmaceutical supply chain to prevent waste, reduce inefficiencies, and ultimately improve patient outcomes. The Pharma supply chain is among the most demanding in logistics, and our software solution is purpose-built to meet these challenges head-on, providing visibility across temperature excursions, communication gaps, chain-of-custody failures, and more. As a member of our initial core team, you will play a pivotal role in achieving this vision and work closely with the founders.

**Position Overview:**
The Founding Engineer will be responsible for building and scaling the company's technology stack, including the Platform UI, Driver App, and general infrastructure (front-end and back-end). This role will focus on developing and deploying scalable, user-centric solutions that enable real-time visibility, predictive insights, and seamless customer interactions. The Founding Engineer will collaborate closely with the Head of Integrations, Product designer, as well as with other stakeholders to ensure technology aligns with business goals and customer needs.

**Key Responsibilities:**
*   **Product Development & Platform Build-Out:**
    *   Oversee the development of Platform UI V1 (real-time visibility, LSP scorecarding, location analytics) and V2 (import orders/shipments, sensor inventory, reporting).
    *   Lead the design and implementation of the Driver App, enabling GPS tracking, checkpoint status confirmation, and communication (chat functionality).
    *   Build in-platform communication features (e.g., calls, emails, texts) and integrate AI-powered check-call functionality (starting with 3rd-party integrations).
    *   Drive the development of AI-based recommendation systems, starting with V1 (route updates) and expanding to V2 (provider/location optimization).
*   **Scalable Infrastructure:**
    *   Ensure the platform is built to scale to 100+ users, 1000s of data point updates every
