Clinical Trials, Patient Experience, Healthcare, Patient Engagement, Payment Solutions, Process Optimization

### Summary
The Tegus Client speaks with a Contracts Manager from Johnson & Johnson about the clinical trials software space and patient experience. The Contracts Manager discusses the use of platforms like Mural Health and Greenphire for patient engagement and payments. They mention the decision-making process for procuring these software solutions and the influence of CROs and sponsors. The Contracts Manager explains that sponsors may not drive the decision around payment vendors in fully outsourced trials, but they may be more involved if there are challenges with patient retention. They also mention the benefits of using Greenphire and their experience with Mural Health. The Contracts Manager believes that Mural Health will gradually increase in adoption and highlights its focus on patient engagement and real-time feedback. They rate Greenphire a seven and Mural Health an eight, suggesting that Mural Health needs to navigate regulatory compliance barriers to reach a rating of ten.

**Tegus Client**
Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today about the clinical trials software space and patient experience with regards to communication payments, transportation, all the things that they need to want to enroll and stay in a trial as an interesting kind of category of software. I would love just to kick it off with kind of your background as well as just kind of like some high-level information on kind of the department that you work in.

**Contracts Manager, US Medical Affairs Oncology at Johnson & Johnson**
Yes. So, I work in clinical trial operations, and I support essentially, I work very closely with sites in a number of clinical trials. Now, as a sponsor, depending on the kind of trial it is, to some extent, we may invest or pay for some of these patient-centric solutions, with respect to, for instance, paying or supporting patient engagement and clinical trials.

And my experience is all about currently, they are in oncology. I've worked in other therapeutic areas as well, both in infectious diseases and vaccines and immunology. And specifically, platforms that we're talking about, like Mural Health and Greenphire, Mural Health is kind of new here, I would say, but Greenphire, like you said, I mean, I've been thinking a lot for a while.

And I think today, the focus I see, it's not just even the software providers, but it's also even CROs, right, sites. We want to encourage patients to obviously remain in trial. So, it's also about retention and engagement and not just simply rewarding for participation.

**Tegus Client**
Yes, makes really good sense. And just on the company side of things, it would be great just to get a sense at a high level for like a number of clinical trials, if you have it off hand that you're running for a year or just like a sense for like scale of the operations.

**Contracts Manager, US Medical Affairs Oncology at Johnson & Johnson**
I don't have a number because we're a global organization, about probably 86,000 employees globally. Trials, I want to say, probably upward of like 300 plus, but these include global and/or regional. But that's just a pure guess. Maybe it's 100 trials, because we're a global company.

**Tegus Client**
And I would love just to start with, and you hit it a little bit already, like how the purchasing decision is made, right? Because you obviously have you as the sponsor, and we know that, that's kind of like the sponsor at the end of the day called the shot.

However, CROs seem pretty influential depending on the sponsor and the trial, and then the sites are obviously less influential, but like have some sway in the decision, too. So, I would love just to get a sense from you like how decisions are made to procure something like a Greenphire or Mural Health.

**Contracts Manager, US Medical Affairs Oncology at Johnson & Johnson**
Yes. So, the best way to describe it is there's three types of trials from a sponsorship perspective. You have outsourced, fully outsourced, fully insourced and hybrid. Hybrid meaning there's a shared relationship ownership, I should say, from a sponsorship again perspective, like who's paying and who's deciding for what between a sponsor and a CRO. So, if it's the trial is fully outsourced, it's very clear that the CRO is going to have a say.

If it's fully insourced, it's going to be clear that the sponsor is going to have a say. And hybrid is certainly shared although often even when it comes to payment patient payments, what I've seen is a lot of sponsors do want to play a role because at the end of the day, there's probably one, they still have a greater oversight, right, regardless it's their product, right?

Or it's their portfolio on the line, it's not the CRO. So, they carry greater risks. And what I've seen in the last even five, 10 years, there's a larger push of sponsors, meaning pharmaceutical companies were trying to drive patient engagement.

So, we obviously have the patient communities, VoCs, with the customer contributions where we're trying to understand, where patients do have a greater role than they have in the past. And this dynamic of patient-physician system relationship. And I would say that while it certainly depends on the contractual agreement between a sponsor and a CRO, you got it right.

It's not like the sites play a role. The only thing is, of course, not every site, some sites will say, hey, for us, it's just easier to pay this way. And also, there's sites, especially larger, we call them SMOs like site management organization.

And I don't want to get dive into the weeds, but like very large and influential sites may not even want to use the system at all. So, there are also instances where for them, it's like we have to make it easier. Like so it's also in our interest as a sponsor, the CRO, who is not involved in the actual relationship between a site and a patient and there's a reason why we're not, also cannot influence.

So, the site is like we are not going to do this. This is why. You're not the one involved in new challenges the patients faces because there are so many other things to talk about it, so many things to deal with, and this is actually why with the challenges and complexities that site deal with, because again, they get paid for every successful patient recruiting, they don't get paid as much for every screen failure.

And if they lose patients, some trials may be terminated earlier, not directly, but there's obviously a financial loss when there were significant challenges. And the other thing you know is the more complex the trials are, like in oncology, trials go through probably an average of six amendments, meaning like there's constant changes in how you pay for these trials. And as a result, right, most organizations are looking for other ways to engage with patients.

I'm not sure all the solutions, I think, while there's not a lot of solutions because today, that payment space hasn't really been disrupted like if you look, we pay physicians, there are so many ways of paying doctors.

We don't have this right because most sites are like, look, this is all we're going to do. And also, the other piece you have to keep in mind is compliance and regulations. You never want it to be about simply encouraging patients to participate because if you're only linking participation to financial value, there's a risk of rivalry and solicitation.

**Tegus Client**
Yes, makes really good sense and I appreciate the way that you broke it down. If we go back to those like three general buckets that you hit insource, outsource, hybrid, like I know that this is a hard question to answer, but it's really helpful if you can ballpark it. Like what percent do you think your trials fall, ballpark percent across those buckets for your trials?

**Contracts Manager, US Medical Affairs Oncology at Johnson & Johnson**
Yes. Again, I have to say, right, as you already know, there's such variability between therapeutic areas, right, to company. But probably, we're doing a lot more in-sourced now because our model has been changing. But still, maybe, let's just say, you say 45% insourced now 40% may be outsourced and then the rest to hybrids.

**Tegus Client**
Got it. And it sounds like that's trending towards more insourcing, right?

**Contracts Manager, US Medical Affairs Oncology at Johnson & Johnson**
For us, at least, and in certain therapeutic areas, but yes, they just told us today want more ownership. We want more ownership. It's very costly. I mean R&D is expensive, and there's risk of things not going into the right direction. And especially as you have automation, you have the things keep in mind, it's like when we work with CROs, there's other things they're doing. They're not just managing a trial.

It could be that we're just outsourcing the talent, it's down. So, we're still able to have the ownership of the trial, but certain things are not done. Then we have all these systems. You have like CTMS, EDC, TMF. You have all these systems that are helping automate things. So, with that automation, there's the thought that you can now have ownership that you didn't think before because you don't need the CRO to do the same thing. So, that is trending.

But again, I still think there's going to be trials that are going to be fully outsourced because you also understand a lot of these CROs, multimillion-dollar companies also have a large power in the way that they are owning these. And sometimes, it just makes sense to keep it that way.

**Tegus Client**
Yes. One more question on that before we jump to the specific vendors and payments. In the case where it's fully outsourced in IQVIA or whoever it might be, is the sponsor still driving the decision around vendors that they want involved in the trial for payments, for example? Or how does that work?

**Contracts Manager, US Medical Affairs Oncology at Johnson & Johnson**
I will say to you that the answer is no. As much as they try for payments, and then just having for payments. CROs especially for us is like we know what we need, we know what our sites want and imagine these types of trials have always been outsourced because there also is a trend like CROs have certain experience and sponsors want to keep it that way.

It makes financial and just an operational spend. And as a result, sponsors don't even ask. I mean, this space is still niched, and that's why Greenphire has been in existence for so long is because nobody questioned it. It never kind of tied to anything. So really, the answer is no. If there's other areas of influence, it's not patient payments. However, where it comes into play, and we've actually seen this during COVID, is that patients don't participate.

And there's reasons why they don't. Maybe they're like, hey, I have to repeat all these visits. So, now, I can go into the office and this payment is tied to my in-office visit. That's where sponsors are starting to be more involved, where they're like to see if there's challenges with retaining patients and some of this, you could tie it to the payment process, then absolutely, they would be involved, but not proactively.

**Tegus Client**
Okay. And one of the things that we've learned so far is sponsors are a bit removed from site and participant satisfaction with what we've heard people call gift cards, right?

**Contracts Manager, US Medical Affairs Oncology at Johnson & Johnson**
That's correct.

**Tegus Client**
So curious, just transitioning into the payment providers, who do you all use? Are you standardized? Is it trial by trial? Like how does that whole kind of selection process work?

**Contracts Manager, US Medical Affairs Oncology at Johnson & Johnson**
Yes. So, you're absolutely right in that and I'll tell you recently a lot of sponsors are trying to be maybe a lack of a better word ignorant is simply because, again, there's compliance, there's regulatory implications if they are the ones who have a say in not only the payment method, but the payment vendor because it's like what if a vendor is known to have like some feature that could tie it that could be suggestive of patients participating only due to financial expenses, then it goes on the sponsor.

And of course, if there's an allegation, why would they go after first of all, comfort, they wouldn't go up to our site, site only follows the protocol, who writes the protocol the sponsor. Or who is sponsor for the protocol. So, that's why, again, I think because this space just hasn't really been disrupted and there's this fear of, like, again, we don't want to touch in an area that is working.

So, from a standardization perspective, you're probably hearing that sponsors want to standardize because it's true that because nobody really touches that area, the reality is they're like, all right, whatever is working is working. That's what they're saying. We're really not standardizing in the sense of like we're saying Greenphire has to be the vendor of choice. And just sometimes we don't even know. We're not even giving that option because we don't even ask.

Like if the CRO is the one who's driving it. We don't even ask. And if, for example, it's always been Greenphire, we never really ask either. So, it's again, it's probably the reflection of ignorance because it's like there's no challenges, why bother?

And again, keep in mind, Greenphire, a lot of times, the way they also contract these types of providers. Is it like it's already embedded in the protocol that in such a way that it's like it's just this is the way it works.

And again, there's not a lot of companies out there that are competing with Greenphire. So, there's also the perception that if we switch or if we consider another vendor, would it actually impact, to some extent, clinical trial operations and more specifically, patients' participation and interest if they're already used to the way that like the Greenphire credit card or debit card works, rather the reward card works.

**Tegus Client**
And do you use Greenphire?

**Contracts Manager, US Medical Affairs Oncology at Johnson & Johnson**
We've used Mural Health. Yes, we've used Mural Health as well in a couple of trials. Some of them were actually in-sourced, but for the most part, it's Greenphire.

**Tegus Client**
Okay. So, maybe we start with Greenphire. I would love just to get kind of your perspective on the business. So, I guess like just starting like what percent of your trials are you using Greenphire on?

**Contracts Manager, US Medical Affairs Oncology at Johnson & Johnson**
Yes. At this time, I wouldn't know because we don't see that information, right? And we don't track it. So, I can't even tell you how many use Mural Health because a lot of it is like some of them may not even use any system at all. I think patients may be paid differently. Because patients also get paid through like noncard payments at all.

So, that's the piece where if we don't even know, and we don't have, we don't track, we don't know. So, I really don't know. But one of the things that's the benefit of using companies like Greenphire is, again, it's a reloadable card.

And then, patients have access, especially those who are savvier, they can track. Like how much money is there and maybe if they spent it, which visits it was tied to things like that, like it's easier for them to track. If we look at it from a patient perspective in terms of evaluating part to look at it from a sponsor perspective, simply because it's the go-to.

**Tegus Client**
Yes. And when you think about like the value prop of Greenphire, is it around patient enrollment and retention? Is it around cost savings through the automation?

**Contracts Manager, US Medical Affairs Oncology at Johnson & Johnson**
It's all about collaboration and process optimization, I would say. I'm not focusing on just like Mural Health is looking into that more because, again, they're trying to differentiate Greenphire because they've been out for a while. They're like, look, we don't track it anywhere else, this is going to streamline the process. Like I mean because we have experience working with sites with healthcare providers with CROs, with sponsors. It's not the different interfaces. Like they have interfaced with the participants, meaning for the site, for the sponsor, they're basically like driving the process.

**Tegus Client**
I got you. And if somebody came to you, I don't know, your boss and you wanted to use Greenphire for a trial and they said, of course making this up, but "Why are we going to pay $200,000 for Greenphire for this trial? Why is it worth it?" What would you say to that person?

**Contracts Manager, US Medical Affairs Oncology at Johnson & Johnson**
Yes. That's a good question. I mean I would probably say we already have maybe a master service agreement with them. We've used them for crossover trials. It's the convenient, it's the comfortable thing to do, right? Unless someone challenges us and says, "Hey, there's been problems like this, why do it?"

And you have to basically keep in mind. When a company like Greenphire has operated in the space for as long as they did, they understand the regulatory environment, too. So, from a compliance perspective, they're like, look, they also understand FMV, which is fair market value. They understand like what's reasonable.

Because you also understand like this is very different than paying physicians. You don't have the same guidance. There's actually no guidance. So, they have created this. They've worked with all these providers and vendors, and they've done benchmarking to help companies understand what's also fair to pay patients.

So, the other thing that I think like this compliance has also driven relationship and comfort amongst sponsors to say, you know what, they're streamlined, they know what to do. You can entrust them with this information. And that's often why companies don't want to switch. Now when we talk about patient payments and other values, I would think of disruption, and I would think of other competitors.

**Tegus Client**
That's super helpful from a qualitative perspective. And if I was your CFO and you had to explain it to me in a quantitative perspective, and I was saying, "Why even use a Greenphire to automate all of this? We can just do it without any solution?"

Like is there an argument around faster time to trial for drugs because of enrollment and retention? Is there an argument around time savings because a bunch of people aren't having to do the payments and reconciliations? Like is there a quantifiable ROI here?

**Contracts Manager, US Medical Affairs Oncology at Johnson & Johnson**
Yes, there's not. We've never tracked this.

**Tegus Client**
And do you have direct experience with Mural Health?

**Contracts Manager, US Medical Affairs Oncology at Johnson & Johnson**
Yes, for certain trials.

**Tegus Client**
Cool. It'd be super helpful just to get your sense of Mural versus Greenphire if you were to do like a compare and contrast.

**Contracts Manager, US Medical Affairs Oncology at Johnson & Johnson**
That's basically it. The reason we wanted to try it, so one of the things is the payments are fully digitalized. So, there's not even a card. It's digitalized, I will say, for certain type of the patients this works. Like if you're in prostate cancer, for example, which we are, your patients are much older. Digitalization is not something they're savvy in. So, that could also probably say that's not for this type of patient.

I mean like I have an older father, like, why would he use it? He's just like, "All right, give me the card, give me the check. Don't give me anything else." So, I do see that's the value in what's different, there's really no card. It's fully digitalized.

And again, they understand payment processes regard to not only participation but like travel, which has been big, obviously, especially post-COVID, and even during COVID, where patients still have to travel to certain sites, you need to pay them. And people are going this site because Mural's focus is more on patient experience.

Saying let's look, it's not about just tying the kind of compensation to participation. It's also we want to motivate them to know, "Hey, like I'm doing good, not only because I'm making money, and I'm getting paid for it, but also because there's a solution that drives that kind of relationship with the site."

And I can see, right, like there's analytics, there's like a dashboard where they can connect through an application with no other participants, we've talked about it. It's from a compliance perspective, again, it's something that I think they're envisioning because the other piece is like how do you get patients to be more engaged? Hopefully, they can engage with other patients, but that's not possible right now in the way that kind of compliance looks to these things. And we have to think of ways that we can make this in a compliant way.

**Tegus Client**
As you think about like market trends going forward, do you think you'll increase adoption of Mural Health? Or was it really just, "Hey, let's try this, it's something new, but we're going to revert back to Greenphire because it works, and it's always worked, and we don't want to mess with something that's working?"

**Contracts Manager, US Medical Affairs Oncology at Johnson & Johnson**
Yes, it's a good question. You're looking at the experiences you have with Greenphire versus Mural Health. What's working? What's different? And then it's really about that experience with the platform. And I do think we're going to be increasing our participation with Mural Health but it's a gradual piece.

And I think as more companies are also talking about it and more trials are being supported with Mural Health, I do think that that's going to encourage more sponsors to look at, again, this space differently. I just think they haven't given themselves the opportunities. And that's why I'm saying, I think patient engagement through collaboration with other patients because a lot of sponsors are already creating these communities.

And I think what Mural Health is trying to do is say, "Hey, we want to give participants a voice, and we know that's something that sponsors are lacking. Like we want to know why patients either stop participation as much as we can get that from other sources.” It's not tied directly to those trials, and this can get them closer to it because the patients are sharing their perspective and Mural Health is also giving that value back to sponsors.

It's not just about collaboration with respect to payments and participation. So, they have this, what they call Portrait Project, which is essentially still the idea, that patients can really understand why, behind why they're interested, what impact it had. And I can tell you, like especially big organization, big pharma, that's what they're starting to look at, right, patient experience.

And I think where Mural Health is moving is in the right direction because you don't have big companies like Greenphire who's doing because they don't ask you. They're like, what the heck is this about. And I do think that the more sponsors start to be involved in something like a Portrait Project or at least start to look at those stories, those stories to help shape, right, like it's not about payment. It's about why I wanted to get involved in this trial.

And then, it's about the technology company that states Mural Health understand why this platform is built around the why. And it's very different then about the process because the stuffs are given, right, obviously, in line. So, it's almost like what they're doing is they're like, "We know what works. We know what doesn't work. We know the challenges you guys have had, which is you can't keep patients in trials."

But even if I know the patient, I have a great process and everything is working, right, like if I clearly don't see the value, and it somehow, it seems, it's just tied to finance it. It's probably going to throw me off.

And I think there's enough information in social media and in the online community where we do have patients unfortunately, who are being kind of almost told like, “Hey, you're only participating for the money.” And that's not what it's actually about. So, that's what we need to show that transformation, I think.

**Tegus Client**
So, a question on what you just said. I know that like the sponsor, we kind of hit it a little bit earlier, can't connect directly with the patient or know who the patient is because these trials have to be blinded. However, it sounds like you're able to get feedback, or maybe I'm hearing you wrong, through Mural around the trial.

Does that mean that like effectively patients can provide feedback to the site or through this app? And then, it's aggregated on like a blinded basis and so then you have an idea like sentiment or reasons people are dropping out or whatever it might be?

**Contracts Manager, US Medical Affairs Oncology at Johnson & Johnson**
Yes. It's not fully like this yet, but that's the vision. I mean right now, yes, patients can communicate, it's just not in the same way, but what you described is exactly what the idea is.

**Tegus Client**
So, you also mentioned you're getting that through other sources. Is that coming through EDC as well? Like what is the value of Mural doing this when other systems are trying to do it?

**Contracts Manager, US Medical Affairs Oncology at Johnson & Johnson**
So, the thing is not directly tied to the trial, but like patients are obviously sharing their voices. No, just that's the thing. Whereas this is hopefully tied. And again, it's going to be aggregated. It's going to be identified, but it's going to be tied to certain trials.

So, outside of the other feedback, yes, but EDC doesn't give it to you in the same way. You basically have to extract the data and conclude that, “Hey, we know, for instance, patients are obviously dropping out because of certain clinical outcomes, right, or maybe lack of participation."

But challenge is we also can't expect sites to drive all that participation. They're stressed out. They have resource limitations. So, what this is trying to get is there's other contributing factors like patients stop participating or patients don't want to participate at all.

And I think that's what they're trying to do because the reality is sponsors are also involved in developing tools and resources to help encourage participation to begin with. It's about starting and continuing. So, it's not just about understanding why they stopped, which is actually what current technologies can give you to some extent, except it's often tied to values, right, or like to clinical outcomes or to data that's been reported.

In this case, where this data could be is, "Hey, we can help you understand what solutions you may need to develop to drive that participation.” Because even if a patient drops out, because of this, patients understand like it's not just like a full-swing failure. There's other things they can do.

There's definitely an untapped opportunity to support patients staying in trials because they drop out because of lack of interest or because they figure out this isn't really working for me. And even those patients, that's an opportunity where sponsors can influence because we definitely want to help these patients. And we definitely know there's patients who simply don't want to participate or stop participating because they doubt this is going to work for them.

**Tegus Client**
Yes. Do the current systems like EDC or whatever it might be, like if I'm a patient and I want to provide feedback as I'm dropping out from my couch, can I do that with the current systems the way that I can do it through the Mural app?

**Contracts Manager, US Medical Affairs Oncology at Johnson & Johnson**
What do you mean when you say drop out from the couch?

**Tegus Client**
Yes. Outside of like the care setting. I'm asking the question, like, is there a way to get the feedback from the patients like in their home when they're deciding to drop out. Because perceivably if Mural had an app and people are on there for payments and transportation, like they can leave the feedback in that app? And I'm curious if there's like a mechanism today to get that?

**Contracts Manager, US Medical Affairs Oncology at Johnson & Johnson**
Yes. I understand what you're saying, yes. You're saying like which point maybe they drop out and they report on it. So, you do have what's called PROs, patient-reported outcomes. And some sponsors you try to kind of link patient participation to reported outcomes. But again, those are often not tied to patient reasons. It's only tied to outcomes. And the answer is no, we don't have that yet, but that's the idea with this. You connect enough feedback. Could you get that now the qualitative feedback rather than quantitative information?

**Tegus Client**
Right. And it's all about the experience around the trial and not the actual outcomes of the trials?

**Contracts Manager, US Medical Affairs Oncology at Johnson & Johnson**
Exactly. And when you talk about engagement and the additional value out of that patient engagement and maybe even if you think about real-time patient feedback is that now sponsors can understand what mechanisms they need to implement to keep patients in trials.

And when you think from the ROI perspective, that's tied to how much budget can be approved. So, when sponsors are asking for, "Hey, for 2024, we need this much money to support this set of trials, we can show what we've done differently to ensure.”

Because everybody is like, "Okay, I'll give you this much money." But if you're going to have trials with patients who are going to be dropping out, if you have a dropout rate of 30%, unless you show me what you're doing about it, right, why should I give you this much money?" So it's hard to tie to ROI currently, but that's the story that leadership can be given to drive a sponsorship.

**Tegus Client**
Super helpful. So, just net promoter score, classic NPS question, which is scale of one to 10, 10 being most likely, how likely would you be to recommend Greenphire to a peer?

**Contracts Manager, US Medical Affairs Oncology at Johnson & Johnson**
I think a seven. They do the job they need to do. I think again, the gap is that patient engagement and other aspects that they're not tracking today.

**Tegus Client**
Yes. What about, same question for Mural?

**Contracts Manager, US Medical Affairs Oncology at Johnson & Johnson**
I would give them an eight. I think again, there's opportunities like we talked about to start to connect some of the feedback to information that sponsors can actually leverage that support decision-making. But I think what I really like about them is they're getting into these areas that sponsors are looking at. I mean these are critical, which is patient engagement and patient participation.

**Tegus Client**
Yes, 100%. And is it getting that feedback that closes the gap from an eight to a 10? Or like what do they need to do to get to a 10?

**Contracts Manager, US Medical Affairs Oncology at Johnson & Johnson**
Yes. I think it's also navigating the regulatory compliance barriers to do that. And I wouldn't expect them to do it. I mean this is through collaboration, with institutions, with sponsors, with regulatory agencies, to say, "Hey, we have to find a way to do it compliantly.” It's not like we're saying compliance is going to shut it down. It's just how do you get around it to making this work?

And at the same time, I wouldn't expect a company like Mural Health to do that. So, I think they're going in the right direction, and that project is coming into play. But I think now it's about saying, “See, now we have this information; what's the most compliant way to get the solution out to the market?”
