## Abstract

Mathematical models have played a significant role in the development of current chemo- and radiotherapy treatment protocols. The widespread use of cytotoxic drugs has shaped the paradigm of uniformly administering a "maximum tolerated dose" to patients; however, this approach fails to account for the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of challenging cancers, including metastatic disease. Recent clinical trials and regulatory decisions have aimed to address these issues by integrating mathematical models to drive preclinical experiments and personalize treatment schedules. By capturing mechanisms of dose-response dynamics, ecological dynamics such as tumor-immune interactions or competition dynamics, and evolutionary dynamics across different therapeutic regimens, mathematical models hold the potential to advance current therapeutic strategies. As more preclinical and clinical data become available, the integration of mathematical models with "virtual patient" frameworks, including "digital twins," and artificial intelligence methods could further advance the mechanistic complexity and decision support capabilities of such models. Nonetheless, translating mechanistic models to routine clinical workflows will require overcoming current translational barriers, notably access to clinical data in standardized formats and regulatory constraints. Overall, recent trials demonstrate the promise of the field of mathematical oncology in translating predictive dynamics into treatment decision-making beyond the "maximum tolerated dose" approach.

**Figure 1.. Mathematical Oncology derives personalized treatment strategies.**

Mechanistic mathematical models integrate experimental and/or retrospective clinical data to capture tumor, drug, or microenvironmental dynamics reflecting patient heterogeneity to infer personalized treatment strategies on a cohort or individual level. Inferred strategies may not only include drug sequencing, as depicted in the schematic, but may also evaluate dosing, combinations, etc. Model calibration might further require multiple iterations of generating hypotheses about the underlying mechanisms, and testing these with experimental or clinical evidence.

(A) The Norton-Simon model describes tumor growth following a Gompertzian law, in which tumor cell kill depends on the proliferation rate of the tumor. (B) The linear-quadratic model displays differential dose-response curves for tissues with high (red) vs. low (blue) *α/β* ratios. (C) Adaptive therapy prolongs time to progression by individualizing treatment breaks that allow drug-sensitive cells to compete with resistant cells. (D) Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics aim to bring drug concentrations within a therapeutic window (highlighted in gray) that balances efficacy and toxicity. (E) Extinction therapy aims to eradicate tumors via a first-strike-second-strike strategy. (F) CAR-T cell kinetics can be described to follow three phases: expansion, contraction, and persistence.
