## Slide 2: The five adjustments are supported by center-level operating realities across collections, supplies, billing, PTO, and training that are not fully captured in the QoE snapshot(1)

**SUDBURY Q3 2025 CONTRIBUTION PROFIT WATERFALL**

1.  **Collections:** PYA’s analysis took a haircut against the contracted rate per unit to adjust for collections percentages; however, this haircut isn’t representative of the timeline to collect (outstanding claims are collectable within 180 days until timely filing). We adjusted the revenue / unit to be equal to the contracted amount per unit. **Net Impact: +0.8% CM**
2.  **Supplies:** PYA’s analysis amortized all supplies expense at the center-level pro rated across centers; however, the vast majority of supplies expense is one-time setup, and recurring supplies expense are limited to clinical director’s supplies Ramp card budget, which has historically averaged $1,528. **Net Impact: +2.6% CM**
3.  **Billing:** PYA’s analysis expensed more than our entire biller’s expense against the unit-level P&L; however, the contracted biller at $24,000 / year is newly hired and manages our technology RCM suite with expectations of overseeing all Massachusetts locations. At 8 locations, biller’s monthly expense is $250. **Net Impact: +1.6% CM**
4.  **Paid-Time Off (PTO):** PYA expensed all unused PTO at the respective unit levels; however, PTO is granted (not accrued) to BCBAs, which comprised 96% of all unused PTO, This PTO accrues on a 12-month basis, and therefore the P&L is overburdened with recent hires and full PTO balances. This PTO balance has been removed. **Net Impact: 1.0% CM**
5.  **Training:** PYA fully-expensed new BTs against the P&L; however, first 2-weeks of work are non-billable training that are over-represented during ramping periods. The first month’s expense for new BTs is divided by 2 in order to account for training time and better represent mature state of center-level economics. **Net Impact: 1.4% CM**

**(1) Remaining delta driven by the QoE accrual-to-cash timing adjustments and 401(k) burdening assumptions.**
