## Slide 4: Traditional Options Fall Short

# Traditional Options Fall Short

1.  **"I Can't Afford My Medication"**
    Many plans have high deductibles or restrict access to prescriptions, forcing members to pay full retail prices.
2.  **"My Drug Isn't Covered, What Do I Do?"**
    Discount cards lack structure, ease of use, & integration. Limited plans don't often include coverage clarity, leaving members scratching their heads.
3.  **"I Don't Have Insurance, But I Still Need Meds"**
    People enrolling in MEC, limited medical, or sharing ministries often get medical-only coverage without any pharmacy benefit.
4.  **"Pharmacy Benefits Are Too Confusing"**
    Benefit designs and member cost sharing have become increasingly complex. Most members don't understand coinsurance, tiers, deductibles, or what is/isn't covered.
