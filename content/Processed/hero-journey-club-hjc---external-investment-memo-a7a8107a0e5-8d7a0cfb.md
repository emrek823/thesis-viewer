### Executive Summary
We're facing the worst mental health crisis our country has ever seen and don't have the tools to address it adequately, particularly for young adults. Gen Z has grown up in an era where mental health conversations are less stigmatized, but they are still less likely to access mental health treatment compared to other age groups. Young adults need and want support but can't access it due to the cost structure of 1-on-1 therapy and a generational disconnect in terms of how they would like to receive the support. At the same time, this age group is flocking to video games and the metaverse ($500B+ global market) for entertainment and community as virtual worlds become the new malls. HJC sits at the convergence of these two trends - meeting patients where they are in these virtual communities and leveraging a clinically robust approach to create a richer and more impactful dialogue around mental health.

After launching 4 months ago, HJC has already grown to a community of over 850 members, facilitated over 475 sessions with 67 weekly paying members, and is showing high gross margins (50% - 70%) with strong metrics (LTV/CAC 4:1). Marc and Brian have been iterating on this idea for >12 months and are uniquely suited to scale the early community they have cultivated while remaining committed to clinical excellence. With this financing, HJC will aim to reach $1M in ARR, demonstrate clinical validity of its model, sign enterprise partnerships (e.g., insurers or gaming platforms), and expand the team. HJC is laying the product, community, and technical foundation today to create a category leader in the

"Metaverse x Healthcare” space, and we are thrilled to support them in this formative period of growth.

Virtue is investing $800K in a $4M seed financing (SAFE) for 4% ownership.

### Mental Health in America
**Mental Health Crisis for Young Adults:** Suicide is now the 2nd leading cause of death for people aged 10-34. In 2020, 25% of people aged 18-24 reported that they seriously considered or attempted suicide. At the same time, less than 50% of all patients with diagnosed mental illness receive any treatments at all, primarily due to the high cost of therapy and shortage of providers. Furthermore, loneliness is a large and unaddressed contributor to mental illness with 61% of young adults reporting feeling lonely "most or the time or all the time." These trends were only

## Page 4: Hero Journey Club (HJC) - External Investment Memo

exacerbated with COVID, with most of the nation struggling to cope with what the US surgeon general has described as a youth mental health crisis.

Gen Z respondents with a self-reported behavioral-health diagnosis were less likely than those from older generations to report seeking treatment.

**Share of respondents reporting they did not seek treatment for behavioral-health diagnosis, %**

McKinsey Jan 2022 Report: Addressing the unprecedented behavioral-health challenges facing Generation Z

**Failure to Meet Patients Where They Are:** Most of the mental health space has been focused on serving primarily high-socioeconomic, educated, and urban elite demographics. It's also reflected in the therapist population, which is mostly middle-aged white women who primarily serve middle-aged white women. Gen Z is more likely to report having a behavioral health diagnosis but less likely to report seeking treatment compared with other generations.
Many seek care on social media instead. Mental health videos on social media are getting billions of views. On TikTok alone, the hashtag #BPD (borderline personality disorder) has 3.7 billion views, #bipolar 2 billion, and #DID (dissociative identity disorder) another 1.5 billion. This “social contagion” can lead

## Page 5: Hero Journey Club (HJC) - External Investment Memo

to disastrous consequences, with many incorrectly self-diagnosing with disorders or suddenly manifesting symptoms because they are now aware of them.

### Power of Gaming
**Virtual Spaces are the New Malls:** Gen Z spends a significant portion of their leisure and connection time in virtual spaces, like video games, which have become the defacto social networks for many. Gen Z spends almost twice as much time hanging out with friends playing video games (~12hrs) than in real-life (~6hrs). Importantly, these connections that are formed and fortified in the gaming world can be just as meaningful compared to offline relationships. >80% of Gen Z views social interactions in a game to be as meaningful, if not more meaningful, than those in real-life. Generationally, there is a willingness towards more authentic expression and association in gaming spaces. By taking mental health out of the clinic and into the spaces where people already convene, HJC can build a community-first therapeutic that is more approachable, engaging, and impactful for people to get the mental health support they need.

**Massive, Global Market Potential:** There are approximately 160M gamers in the US (2.5B worldwide). 29M monthly active US players on Minecraft (170M monthly active globally), 200M monthly in Roblox globally and 350M monthly players in Fortnite globally. With this growth, gaming has begun to permeate all aspects of social life and culture. In the past, gaming had a reputation that it was limited to a niche audience of adolescent males, but >60% of all Americans play video games today. While most major entertainment mediums have seen growth over the last 20 years, the growth in gaming has outpaced them all. Today, the gaming market is 2x larger than music and film combined. Global games market revenue is forecasted to reach $219B in 2024 following a massive increase in interest during the pandemic.

### The Gaming Market is 2x Larger than Music and Film Combined
While most major entertainment mediums have shown modest growth, the gaming industry is now larger than the global entertainment industry
This secular growth has been driven by mobile in the late aughts and early teens, AR/VR in the mid-teens, and esports today

Unlike the majority of venture backed US healthcare startups, Hero Journey has massive global potential. North America is a massive market, representing ~25% of global gaming revenues, but the APAC region represents ~50% of overall gaming revenues. Similar to the United States, teens and adolescents around the world have been reeling from the impacts of COVID and facing similar challenges. The same barriers to accessing quality care and stigma are more pronounced around the globe, particularly in regions where traditional mental health services are still severely stigmatized or gaming/social media cultures are distinct from the US. While Hero Journey will focus on the US market for the first 3-5 years, the clinical protocols, community, and technology platform the company is developing sets them up for worldwide scale.

**Additional Metaverse Considerations:** The Metaverse is the convergence of physical and digital in a way that is persistent, real-time, rendered and infinite in its ability to offer shared experiences. What we see today does not match this definition, but technology breakthroughs and the broader acceptance of the video game industry is fostering excitement.

In a Web 2.0 world, we have already seen open-environment games (e.g., Roblox, Fortnite, Minecraft) start to create and develop metaverse-like experiences for all constituents. The idea of being able to build whatever you can imagine and then to experience these fantastic worlds alone or with others has been at the heart of video games from the very beginning. With each breakthrough the industry has found new ways to reach a wider audience with deeper engagement. The overall market potential for the metaverse ranges from $400B - $800B as applications move beyond purely gaming into broader entertainment, music, retail, education, and advertising. Fortnite, for example, hosted an in-game concert with DJ Marshmello which had ~11mm concurrent players in attendance and nearly 27mm views on YouTube. Since then, Roblox, Epic Games, Microsoft, and many other companies have continued to build and create immersive virtual experiences by partnering with brands (Roblox + Gucci), sports leagues (NFL + Roblox), and educational institutions (Minecraft + Cal Poly).

Goldman recently did an analysis to understand overall market sizes and digital penetration of these markets for virtual worlds/metaverse to understand the potential opportunity by segment. Advertising and music have seen the highest levels of digital penetration while retail and education lag behind. We added a healthcare column, specifically in mental health, to compare the relative opportunity in healthcare and how to frame our thinking on future growth.

McKinsey recently reported that ‘Attending a telehealth appointment' is the 2nd most cited (47%) of survey respondents to their recent Metaverse Consumer Survey (Feb 2022). We believe that many of the shortcomings of a today's Metaverse do not necessarily restrict the ability to deliver and receive quality mental health care today. For instance, existing limitations to today's Metaverse such as lack of interoperability and immersive 3D experiences leveraging VR/AR or constraints on the total number of concurrent users per experience do not negatively affect the ability to provide or receive high quality mental healthcare via the group or 1:1 Hero Journey Club care model.

**Gaming Platforms as a Unique Distribution Mechanism:** The power of gaming platforms, marketplaces, and vendors, such as Twitch and Roblox, comes from the unique interaction and role members play in the community. Twitch, for example, enables gamers to stream live sessions over the internet and monetize viewers through revenue sharing agreements. In other areas of media and entertainment (music, television, film, etc) publishers try to curtail consumers streaming content, but Twitch has embraced the live streaming community. The key reason for this is that games can be consumed both as a participant and a viewer, whereas traditional media generally has only one modality (e.g., viewing). This dynamic strengthens the community around a game and, therefore, the lifetime value of the game.

## Page 10: Hero Journey Club (HJC) - External Investment Memo

Roblox, an online gaming platform with a global community of billions of users and millions of developers who produce their own immersive multiplayer experiences using Roblox Studio, is another example of unique dynamics in the gaming community. Roblox has cultivated a creator community with >8M active creators who own the IP and have direct economic incentives for the games they create. Robux, the primary digital currency used on the Roblox platform, is a powerful economic incentive for users and developers that creates powerful network effects. As Roblox looks to expand its age demographic, enter new geographies, and develop new gaming experiences, these network effects are at the core of their growth strategy.

### Patient Experience:
**Overview:** HJC provides evidence-based, community-first support groups that are designed to engage young adults (aged 15-35) within digital spaces like Discord, Minecraft, and Roblox.

## Page 11: Hero Journey Club (HJC) - External Investment Memo

(Image montage depicting HJC experience elements: User profiles, a Discord-like chat with a question "What's an example of an unhealthy coping mechanism that no longer works for you?", a gaming scene with chat, and a "HERO JOURNEY CLUB" profile showing "ANDREW BIG27" as "LEVEL 2: SEEKER CLASS" with "SKILLS EARNED: DBT MASTERY, EMOTIONAL REGULATION LEVEL 2, CBT COPING LEVEL, NAVIGATING NEURODIVERGENCE" and "CAMPAIGNS:")

**Journeyer Experience**
*   **Onboarding / Intake:** Matched with journey crew based on age, life stage, acuity, identity, growth areas, and games they play. Screen out SMI
*   **Journey Sessions:** Weekly 90 min support groups inside of discord and video games, led by therapists trained in evidence-based modalities
*   **Community Support:** "Peer Quests" (non-clinical peer support groups), gaming meetups, psychoeducation, and daily reflection check-ins
*   **Level up + Growth:** Earn mental health badges and skills for attending Journey Sessions and Peer Quests to celebrate growth + progress

**Onboarding / Intake:** Almost all of HJC members ("Journeyers”) find the community through the website. 50% engage with the company through Intercom and 50% join without any prior engagement. Anecdotally, 1/2 of people join immediately after finding us and then the others interact more slowly and do their research over a few weeks. Journeyers are onboarded within 1-2 days of sign up when possible and placed in a group within the week.

**Peer-Group Session:** The main focus of the sessions is the weekly counseling itself, which is completely anonymous. The group is capped at 5 people so that there's enough time to have everyone share and get support. The sessions starts with a group of intros a quick check in question, and then they discuss a theme as a group. The therapist will introduce worksheets and tools based on CBT/DBT techniques and other evidence-based modalities to give members a tangible area to work on. While that session is happening, the group is typically gaming together behind the scenes but most people use the game to keep occupied while they listen in to the session (e.g., it can sometimes be awkward to not do anything while others are talking).

**Community:** The core of the member experience is the Hero Journey discord channel, which is free to join. Most of the engagement is in daily check-ins, positive affirmations, venting, or gaming or art channels that may have nothing to do with mental health. Peer quests (or general community events) happen 3-7 times per week. They are less structured than journey sessions and the community of peers and clinically-trained moderators run events to keep folks engaged between sessions. Community events include

## Page 12: Hero Journey Club (HJC) - External Investment Memo

*   Gaming and hangout events by the community, across a myriad of different games (5-20 people)
*   Art making night (~10 people)
*   Movie streaming night (lots of demand but can't due to copyright)
*   Weekly check-ins twice per week (20-40 people each time)
*   Tabletop sessions for dungeons and dragons

### Community
**"Go-To-Community” Strategy:** A strong community can protect against competitors or products through greater brand awareness, higher switching costs, or economies of scale. This strategy is related, but distinct, from the overall GTM strategy. Often, companies view community as an add-on to the GTM efforts. Ultimately, these differences come down to essential questions of “what motivates community members?” and “who do members trust?”. Communities can be many things, but a useful taxonomy to classify communities into is:

*   **Communities of Product** — Members of these communities are focused primarily on discussing and learning about a specific product, like Sephora's Beauty Insiders, Twilio's Champions program, or Salesforce Trailblazers.
*   **Communities of Practice** — Members are all about leveling-up a discipline or craft, and connecting with other practitioners, independent of any tools or platform. Examples include cohort-based learning community On Deck, or design communities, like Dribbble.
*   **Communities of Play** — Members of this category come together around a common interest, like sports, gaming, athletics, arts, and more. Think gaming communities on Discord, or NBA Top Shot.

Communities of practice and play best define Hero Journey. Members are looking to "level-up" their own mental health while also giving back to the community. At the same time, the community fosters interest around gaming, culture, art, and music that maintains a collegial and close-knit environment.

As HJC scales, the balance between “value creation” (creating the trust, relationship, and gravity that draws in community members) and “value capture"

## Page 13: Hero Journey Club (HJC) - External Investment Memo

(converting to paid customers/users) will be vital to maintain quality and authenticity. The community drives engagement and brand loyalty with HJC services, so that members who are ready and able to subscribe also have people from whom they can derive implicit trust. HJC leverages the general evolution from proximity to interest-based social graphs. Instagram and Facebook (proximity-based) help you identify mutual friends, while TikTok, Discord, and the next-generation of social platforms organize individuals around interests instead (often anonymously).

### Clinical
**Gaming is an Effective Mental Health Delivery Mechanism:** Some experts have voiced concerns about screen time and online gaming addiction, but leveraging these same engaging concepts for good rather than evil can have dramatic impacts. Clinical literature shows that video games can act as a bridge to other coping skills. If someone is overwhelmed by intrusive thoughts during a session, playing a video game for a few moments can help reduce anxiety. Other games using evidence-based techniques (neurofeedback, exposure training, and attention bias modification) have shown to be as effective as CBT in RCTs.

HJC has the potential to go beyond simple gamification and use true game design to create a new generation of clinically validated gaming experiences. The anonymity of these virtual communities allows members to discover their internal voice and meaning in different forms, whether through avatars, artwork, or other digital creations. This ability to create an outward, digital persona that matches how they view themselves on the inside is a powerful tool create open and honest dialogue about a broad range of mental health topics. Studies have shown that individuals (e.g., soldiers discussing PTSD) are more likely to have an honest dialogue in anonymous settings. Anecdotally, therapists at non-profits around the country, such as Geek Therapy, have seen that children who struggled with in-person therapy began to come alive and to develop more confidence in a virtual environment.

This impact that transformed self-representation can have on behavior, dubbed the Proteus Effect after the Greek God Proteus who could assume whatever shape he pleased, has been studied for decades. Only now do the rise of virtual communities give us the ability to productize these experiences at scale.

## Page 14: Hero Journey Club (HJC) - External Investment Memo

**Patient Population Focus:** HJC is leveraging its strong clinical and product expertise to build rigorous tools and support systems to scale clinically validated care. The typical HJC members ranges from ages 13-55, with most users in their 20s-30s. These members are spread across the US, but surprisingly high portion in the midwest and south, with a majority of them working class or in-school. ~50% are diagnosed with mental illness and working with therapist/psychiatrist already, while another ~50% seeking support for the first time (blend of anxiety, depression, loneliness, cPTSD, neurodivergence, queer identity). For the non-binary teen in rural Mississippi, options are few and far between for quality, understanding, and accessible mental health solutions. These users are completely ignored today and gravitate towards this new digital medium in ways that they never could otherwise.

HJC is more focused on this sub-acute population today and has emergency resources to refer patients out during times of crisis. Over the next 12-18 months, HJC will continue to explore parallel paths as they grow their patient population. HJC has the ability to explore whether to double-down on subclinical to support broader base of population, or move full clinical and provide full stack of support for SMI and range of acuity.

**Data + Outcomes Collection:** Users are provided clinically validated mental health surveys (GAD-7, PHQ-9, etc) across various time points in their journey (e.g., 1-2x/month). Over time, this longitudinal data collection can capture and validate the early positive outcomes HJC is seeing in its early population. The team is also going through the process of designing clinical study endpoints for its internal

## Page 16: Hero Journey Club (HJC) - External Investment Memo

research study. The study will look to show PHQ9 and GAD7 improvement (ideally at session 1, 3, 5, and beyond), progress towards individual goals defined in onboarding, as well as diagnosis-specific batteries for progression, high engagement in program (NPS, attendance, perceived authentic sharing), above average retention, and adherence to and impact of EBTs in sessions.

With this clinical foundation, HJC can leverage its internal platform to pull novel sources of data from member interactions on discord, activity on discussion boards, and other rich datasets never before accessed in this population. Even today, HJC has an active and engaged community that is actively asking for new solutions and helping them build out their product roadmap. Beyond product considerations, the company can tie clinical outcomes into broader engagement with the forum and community, time spent speaking in a journey session, and "gaming levels" or "stars” associated with progression in the games. The promise of digital biomarkers in mental health has not reached its full potential because people have been able to build the engaged community at scale to drive correlation between different activities. Hero Journey can proactively reach out to members that have not posted in the community for a certain number of days or provide positive reinforcement about how their connections with the community can drive improve outcomes.

**Scaling Clinician Supply:** Sessions are anchored in CBT/DBT/ACT methodologies and facilitated by Journey Guides (Master's or Doctorate therapists), who are typically gamers themselves. HJC guarantees hours and group sizes, handles all journeyer communication, scheduling, support, onboarding, and payment for them between sessions so they can focus on therapy without any headache. HJC is focused on taking recently graduated therapists and doing training/supervision themselves to help train the next generation of community-first clinicians. Clinicians are trained in a tiered stepped-care approach for access to higher skilled clinicians as needed, so everyone practices at the top of their license.

Today, Hero Journey has generated excitement with a group of early-adopter clinicians who are gamers and believe in the mission and vision. As the company scales, the quality of its clinician supply will be a key factor for growth. The company will continue to leverage its unique brand and value proposition to attract high-quality clinicians, but can also leverage creative strategies to increase its clinician supply. Members of the community who have been through 10-20 journeys at this point are already receiving additional badges and levels

representing their progress in the Hero Journey community. Leveraging telehealth platforms (e.g., Wheel) can also help them deal with supply and demand imbalances as they scale.

### Business Model and GTM
**D2C Setting a High Bar:** Today, Hero Journey allows members into the community for free and charges a $30/week subscription model. Although the company will evolve its business model and GTM over time, D2C is vital for HJC to engender a strong sense of community and to have the privilege of learning from early users. In healthcare, the top companies win on distribution. HJC sets the bar high by going D2C first because the willingness to pay out of pocket for healthcare is low with consumers. If the company can build a scalable business at a price point that provides strong retention, then the company can gain confidence the product is ready for scale. Going to payers is a non-trivial, but relatively straightforward process that takes a lot of time and is expensive to set up.

In addition, the company is targeting separate ad keywords compared to other mental health players (e.g., Cerebral, BetterHelp, etc). Hero Journey is seeing a CAC of $30 - $80 per lead for gaming specific keywords compared to the $200+ for other companies in the mental health space. While the company is not relying on this strategy for growth over the long-term, its an example of creative strategies for customer acquisition that HJC's model allows.

**Reimbursement Model with Insurers:** There are existing FFS billing codes that HJC can already use for telemedicine care with group therapy (CPT 90853) and are reimbursed by both medicaid and commercial carriers. The 90853 CPT code can be billed for groups up to 10 for 45-60 min sessions and rates (depending on the state and plan) are comparable/higher than than the current OOP cost ($30/session). CMS and other payers will reimburse certain CPT codes, including 90853, for audio-only visits that HJC can leverage given the anonymous nature of HJC session. For direct or preferential payer/employer payments on a PMPM basis, HJC is conducting clinical studies to prove clinical impact for the model. Depending on the state HJC would need to credential the provider group and the clinicians with each payer geography by geography and then capture a significant enough member base for each market. The company currently refers out on a one-off basis to national groups or providers in their local area. At scale, the referral pathway could evolve to partnerships with institutions who can provide care, noncompetitive therapy offerings, or a trusted network of providers that can the company can tap into.

**Gaming Platforms:** HJC also has the opportunity to experiment with creative distribution and monetization strategies with gaming platforms (e.g., Roblox, Fortnite). For many, video games often serve as an escape from bullying in the real world. However, as harassment and cyberbullying within games increases, victims may feel they can never get away from it, often leading to depression, anxiety and long-term damage to self-esteem. ~75% of online multiplayer gamers have experience some form of harassment and ~20% of players actually quit playing games due to certain harassment. Harassment and cyberbullying increases churn, impacting user retention, revenue, and scalability. Companies today, such as Two Hat, provide content moderation services to help to classify and escalate real-time interactions between users. Two Hat, which analyzes >100B interactions every month, was recently acquired by Microsoft. As the industry continues to evolve, content moderation infrastructure is evolving from not only filtering out malicious behavior, but also intelligently catalyzing user engagement to become facilitators of shared digital experiences. This is especially crucial for the world of gaming, which primarily leverages a digital commerce-driven revenue model (e.g., micro-transactions, tipping) that benefits from users interacting with each other and sticking around.

### Traction:
Since launching 4 months ago, HJC has grown to a community of over 850 members and facilitated over 475 sessions with 67 weekly paying "journeyers". ~69% of journeyers (members who pay for at least one session) stay with HJC past week 5 and have continued to subscribe in perpetuity. On average those members attend ~10 sessions (a number that continues to grow with cohort progression) and average LTV for those members is $240. A few journeyers have been with HJC since the very beginning and still attend sessions weekly, 20 sessions in. ~30% of churned members have been reactivated in the last 1.5 months. Most of these churned members left because they were hospitalized or couldn't attend due to financial reasons.

While the product doesn't resonate with everyone and the company is still exploring who the ideal users will be at scale, the people who are very passionate.

### Competition

## Page 20: Hero Journey Club (HJC) - External Investment Memo

Mental health startups have raised the most venture funding over the last 3-4 years compared to other clinical focus areas, with ~$5B raised in 2021 alone. Mature companies, such as Lyra Health ($235M Series F), Spring Health ($190M), and Ginger ($100M), have raised large rounds to focus mostly on adults with mild/moderate anxiety and depression. Over the last 12-18 months, however, we've seen a rise in activity in startups serving pediatrics, adolescents and young adult populations. We've spoken to 20+ players (representative sample below) but each has proven to be only a slight iteration on the same clinical model and GTM approach.

*   **Caraway ($10.5M funding led by 7Wire and OMERS)** - Virtual care, including gynecologists, psychiatrists, family medical practitioners, adolescent specialists, therapists, nurses and care coaches, for college-aged women
*   **Chill Pill** - audio-based peer support platform designed for woman's mental health; raised ~$1M pre-seed at ~$5M post (Stellation) in Q4-21.
*   **Cartwheel ($4m in funding led by GC)** - Virtual care services with therapists selling through middle schools and high schools
*   **Handspring** - Virtual therapy services for children, adolescents, and young adults with in-person clinics coming soon
*   **Appa** - 12 week program leveraging coaches to engage Gen-Z
*   **Wave Health** - Coaching, therapy, and peer support for Gen-Z
*   **Flourish Labs** - Peer-based group therapy focused on college students

These startups have leveraged lessons from “Mental Health 2.0" in adult populations and tried to roughly apply these lessons to a younger population, or struggled to scale group or peer-to-peer based therapy. HJC has imagined an entirely new clinical model and focused on meeting patients where they are to address these concerns around scalability, cost, and securing reimbursement.

### Financing / Milestones
With this round of financing, HJC is looking to reach $1M in ARR, prove out its clinical model, set up the infrastructure to bill FFS insurance, and grow the team.

**$1M ARR:** Reaching $1M ARR will require ~700 weekly active members and ~20 part time therapists. Based on the company's growth rate over the last 4 months, sporadic ad spend, and optimized onboarding process, we have confidence the company can hit this milestone even assuming a very conservative ~50% churn. Over the next 12-18 months, the company will continue to maximize paid social, virtual, and IRL channels to drive this growth. For paid social, HJC will continue to experiment and optimize paid ad spend on Instagram and Facebook, sponsor content with discord communities or Twitch gamer influencers, or leverage content marketing through Minecraft. HJC can have gamer conferences, online event portals, sponsor gaming tournaments, or even sell virtual swag or digital assets inside of games to spur organic growth and create referral loops inside the community.

## Page 22: Hero Journey Club (HJC) - External Investment Memo

**Clinical Evidence:** The company is currently working with advisors and academic to design study endpoints for their initial study utilizing the current user base. Key outcomes include:

*   PHQ9 and GAD7 improvement (ideally at session 1, 3, 5, and beyond, but monthly/quarterly is more common)
*   Progress towards individual goals defined in onboarding, as well as diagnosis-specific batteries for progression (Rates of remission for anxiety/depression, self-reported loneliness scales, self-harm reduction
*   Engagement in program high (NPS, attendance, perceived authentic sharing)
*   Retention in program higher than industry average
*   Adherence to and impact of EBTs in sessions
*   Medication adherence, ER visit prevention, LOS reduction, etc

**Bill Insurance on FFS Rails:** HJC will go through the process over the upcoming months to set up the credentialing and RCM infrastructure to bill insurance through its own friendly PC. This process is non-trivial, but relatively straightforward. The biggest bottlenecks are the timing around the setup of the PC, provider credentialing, and clinician recruitment (assuming an early part-time clinician: patient ratio of ~1:35). While the initial path is to get in network with payers and start billing FFS codes that are already available, the company will also go through the process of engaging with payers and employers about other case rates or PMPM fees. The focus for this round will be around maintaining a strong community and ensuring the commercial strategy is ready for scale at the next round, rather than optimizing for near-term revenue at the expense of the early community building.

**Grow the Team:** Marc builds most of the platform components and engineering, and monitors analytics solutions. Brian is more focused on design, product work, clinician onboarding/hiring and external partnerships. Together, they tackle most other things, including community engagement, marketing, customer support, and growth. The next 2-3 key hires will be a chief medical officer / VP of clinical to build out the clinical org, a community manager who can lean into sales and marketing (particularly in gaming world), and a full-stack engineer to support platform development as the company prepares for scale. Over the next 12-18

## Page 23: Hero Journey Club (HJC) - External Investment Memo

months, the company will look to bring on a marketing/growth lead, clinical recruiter/coordinator, game designer, 1-2 engineers, and a customer support hire.

### Exit Scenarios and Returns Analysis
Our exit scenarios and returns analysis are driven by the unique characteristic of HJC's business and approach - the clinical model and customer acquisition strategy that can drive rapid growth, scalable gross margins, optionality of working with both gaming platforms and healthcare stakeholders, and global potential. We modeled different scenarios and were aggressive with dilution over multiple funding rounds to understand potential exits for HJC assuming Virtue invests another $925K in the subsequent round of financing.

The base outcomes (showed unweighted based on probability) demonstrate the expected absolute returns and CoC multiple based on a $1.725M total investment over 2 rounds. After a hypothetical $10M Series A at a $40M pre-money valuation, Virtue would have ~5% ownership. The ownership at exit going forward is determined my modeling out future financing rounds, valuations, and exit timelines (2025 and beyond) based on the scenarios described above.

For example, if the company fails to scale its group-based model and is valued solely based on its patient volume (healthcare stakeholder) or clinical expertise (gaming stakeholder), it will likely only raise 1-2 more rounds of financing at sub-optimal valuations, diluting our ownership (~3.5% at exit) without reaching exit velocity (~$100M exit). If the company is able to scale within gaming and healthcare channels, reach >50K users, and reach global scale, it will require significant funding ($200M+) but raise at more favorable valuations to limit our dilution (~2% ownership at exit).

As with all investments, the "return the fund" analysis shows gives us confidence that HJC alone could return the entire $31.25M Fund I. While these scenarios will likely require more funding and have a higher probability of incurring more dilution to our Seed and Series A position over time, it is representative of the potential and confidence we have in the company. Investing in the product/technology necessary to scale a gaming community, onboarding clinicians, and acquiring customers will require significant funding, but HJC has the attributes necessary to reach this type of scale.

### Opportunities / Risks
#### Opportunities
*   **Team with a unique advantage:** We believe product-focused and technical founding teams have a unique advantage to build transformational healthcare companies. They can leverage the the commercial and GTM playbooks from previous mental health companies and build 10x better product and patient experiences. HJC perfectly fits that mold. We've tracked every pediatric, teen, and young adult mental health play over the last 12 months and seemed to see care models copy and pasted from other populations and demographics without much product innovation. We've also seen a number of gaming, VR, and metaverse companies build engaging gaming experiences or virtual worlds, but failed to bring the clinical sophistication necessary to scale a big business.
*   **Winner take-all, global markets:** Very few venture-backed US care delivery businesses can successfully expand globally. Most companies grow and are optimized for the intricacies of the US healthcare industrial complex, and often look to acquisition to enter new geographies (e.g., Teladoc). HJC is focused

on the US today, but has the potential to reach global scale over the next 5-10 years. In addition, the nature of these viral digital communities create winner-take-all dynamics where early investments in building the community can pay off exponentially over the long-term.
*   **Cash efficient and (relatively) high gross margin care delivery business:** A strong community, brand, NPS and high quality clinical care will reduce customer acquisition costs over the near and long-term. Today, HJC is able to acquire patients cost-effectively with gamer keywords that have a lower CAC ($30-$80) than mental health ($200+). This strategy is only the first example of how Brian and Marc can creatively leverage their position in both gaming and healthcare to acquire customers and build the community. The company pairs this acquisition muscle with strong unit economics of a group based model (50%-70% gross margins) and strong retention (4:1 LTV / CAC ratios).

#### Risks
*   **Clinician Supply:** Building a scalable and robust technology platform to handle a community of thousands or tens-of-thousands of members is no easy feat, but hiring and maintaining the best physicians will be biggest cost and hindrance of growth. >$5B in venture funding flowed into mental health startups in 2021 alone, which is causing increasing demand for therapists and counselors that are already in short-supply. The peer-support and community for HJC is an important part of the experience, but the journeys led by mental health professionals will remain the core of the experience. We have seen time and time again with other mental health comps and the broader digital health space that the most successful companies engage, motivate, and retain the best clinicians. HJC has found a motivated group of early adopters who are committed to the cause, but will need to ensure a repeatable process as they scale.
*   **Community Content Moderation & Digital Civility:** Today, Marc, Brian, and other content moderators at HJC know the story of most members of the community and can build a close-knit relationship. What happens when this scales beyond the ~850 members? Although HJC is focused more on the sub-acute population today, mental health issues can quickly escalate (e.g., suicides, overdoses, etc). Moderating this type of activity can be extremely difficult at scale. Two Hat, as mentioned above, was analyzing >100B

interactions every month at the time of acquisition. Striking the tone between inviting and welcoming, while also maintaining a professional and clinical approach will be an important needle to thread.
*   **Maintaining virality of community:** If you fail to keep up engagement in the community or succumb to the mob of “cancel culture” (rightly or wrongly), the community can suffer dramatically. The rapid growth, stickiness, and engagement inherent with virtual communities is a double-edged sword. The virality and interest that drive growth can snowball downward if members are not engaged. Most individuals are on 10+ discord channels today and have an almost unlimited set of games, experiences and worlds to choose from. Twitch streamers and other content creators on TikTok that see rapid growth (e.g., see below for Ninja, one of the largest Twitch streamers in the world) but also lose followers quickly if they are not constantly producing content and keeping the audience engaged. HJC may face these same dynamics. It is important to build the foundation early for a scalable technology platform, engaged community that continues to give back, and strong content moderation to mitigate these potential impacts.

*   **Commercial / GTM:** While there are precedents of D2C care delivery businesses that successfully evolve to broader enterprise plays as they scale, many have failed. Some of the major reasons include selection bias with early adopters, unwillingness for consumers to pay over time (low LTV), high acquisition costs for customers, subsequent churn, and failure to demonstrate clinical outcomes. Tactically, the D2C to B2B transition is effective if you can

leverage your initial user traction to drive product iteration and leverage initial data (engagement, clinical outcomes, economic ROI) to expedite B2B sales cycles. Hero Journey is well on its way with early traction, its product ethos and DNA as evidenced by the last 2 years of iteration, and the team's clinical focus from day one. Unlike other healthcare companies, HJC also has the potential to explore other enterprise opportunities with gaming platforms and virtual communities.
