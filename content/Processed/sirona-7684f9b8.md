## Slide 6: KEY TAKEAWAYS

1.  **US RADIOLOGY:** $110B Market, 50% Private Practice, Largest Source of Outpatient Profit (35%)
2.  **RADIOLOGY IT:** On-Prem, Fragmented, >80% of All Healthcare Data
3.  **LAST 12 MONTHS:** Regulatory Shifts = Unified Cloud Solution Now Possible
4.  **SIRONA:** Radiology IT Rebuilt from 1st Principles - Unified, Cloud SaaS w/ Novel Value
5.  **SIRONA TODAY:** Building Four Pillars of Competitive Advantage & Unifying 2% of US Radiologists
6.  **SERIES B:** $40M Investment to Unify Radiology onto a Single Defensible Platform

## Slide 7: RADIOLOGY IT

FRAGMENTED & ON-PREM SOFTWARE.
POWERING $110B US RADIOLOGY MARKET.

## Slide 8: RADIOLOGY IS AT THE DAWN OF A NEW DIGITAL AGE

Radiology has always been defined by technology. The practice has been reinvented with each technological era - the business model, reimagined.

| | 1960         | 1980           | 2000                  | 2020                        |
| :---------------- | :----------- | :------------- | :---------------------- | :-------------------------- |
| **Catalyst**        | Radiograph   | CT/MR          | Digitization 1.0        | Cloud/SaaS                  |
| **Basis of Competition** | Limited      | Sub-specialization | Operational Efficiency  | Clinical Productivity, Consumer Empowerment |
| **Provider Model**  | Hospitals (Monopoly) | Outpatient Centers (Disaggregated) | Teleradiology Networks (Centralized) | Virtual Clinics (Distributed) |

## Slide 9: BUT TODAY'S RADIOLOGY WORKFLOW IS FRAGMENTED, BROKEN, & EXPENSIVE

An amalgamation of poorly designed, piecemeal software increases task complexity, reduces productivity, & negatively impacts patient care.

**Statistic:**
>80% MEDICAL DATA BY VOLUME

One of the last bastions of the knowledge worker using purely fragmented, on-prem software.

## Slide 10: AND POOR INFORMATION FLOW BETWEEN SILOES KEEPS RADIT ON-PREM

Components of the RadIT stack were developed independently, linked by weak & bespoke integrations, & can't be modernized piece-by-piece.

**Workflow Components and Data Flows:**

## Slide 11: SIRONA'S SOLUTION: REIMAGINE RADIOLOGY IT FROM FIRST PRINCIPLES

Radiology's standardized input (images, DICOM) & output (reports, HL7) offer solution to workflow problem through unification.

**Top-level Workflow:**
PATIENT -> SCANNER -> IMAGES -> RADIOLOGIST -> REPORT -> INTERNET -> CLINICIAN

**Unified Platform Components (Puzzle Pieces):**
*   IMAGES (DICOM) -> DICOM Router -> WORKLIST -> VIEWER -> REPORTER -> COMMUNICATION -> PEER REVIEW -> AI MODELS -> ARCHIVE -> RIS -> WEB PORTALS -> REPORTS (HL7)

## Slide 12: WHY NOW: REGULATORY SHIFTS ALLOW FOR FIRST UNIFIED CLOUD PLATFORM

In the last 12 months FDA downgraded Radiology IT to exempt status, allowing Sirona to unify the entire radiology IT stack as cloud SaaS.

**FDA / Regulatory**
*   (2020) Viewers: Downgraded to Class I (Exempt)
*   (2021) PACS Archive: Downgraded to Class I (Exempt)
*   (2020) Sirona IA: Deemed Class I (1st FDA Exempt AI)

**Cloud Tooling**
*   (2019) Cloud-Native Image Rendering SDK's
*   (2020) Commodity Medical Speech-to-Text API's
*   (2020) 5G / StarLink / Networking Infrastructure

AN FDA EXEMPT, UNIVERSAL APPLICATION.
FIRST TO MARKET. ONE PLATFORM. MANY PRODUCTS.
