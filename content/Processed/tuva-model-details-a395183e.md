What do you think average ACV per customer will be in 2025?

For 2025, will new deals signed be a mix of tech (~80%) + Services (~20%? Or do you want to show that you sign customers as services than convert to tech revenue?

Gross margins - big open question. Need to define with Aaron

We’d like break down of new customer to be…and this will evolve over time

Payers

Providers

Health tech

Etc

Land-and-expand opportunities to grow these contracts over time

What does first $1m annual deal look like / when does it hit?

We need X customers to build a $10M ARR business

S&M increase over time

Notes on overall story

Parts of business model / GTM

Others

Services initially (consulting to install open-source) and over time it migrates over time to that everyone wants their data in this thing.

The way that they buy is not by buying open-source and we have distribution with a couple of other features and subscription to access that

DB or RedHat - when you buy RedHat you get access to a portal and you get

DB - they OS most of it but if you want to port over from DB to OS that would be a huge migration

MultiCare example

$150K - $400K. Frontloaded and first year is $300K

THESE SCALE OVER TIME - land and expand. Add-ons in ecosystem drive

ACV / customer types

ACV 2024 and 2025

Enterprise (MultiCare): $300-$400K

Embedding

Midmarket (Notable Series B+): $100-$150K

Moving into VBC analytics

Low end of market (Startups): $10-$50K

Little help beyond OS

Grow into midmarket

2024: Model it in such a way that we sign MultiCare and 1 other enterprise

2 Enterprise deals this year

Mid-Market

Not similar to other deals - we’ll price per data source for installation and maintenance. 10-20 data sources ($10K  and $1k/ month for maintenance

Extensions to service category grouper - they might just buy an FTE from us for 6 months to embed with their team and build this stuff out. That also is product development

Revenue - pay subscription to get access to Tuva Core, to access MPI engine, to access normaliation engine

While there are open source engines - you want a company (not community!) aand other features to integrate

MPI engine example - right now. Right now, software is open-source and we charge implementation and minatenace. Work to get up and running on 2 or more data sources. It runs evey month and someone has to amek sure it’s running properly. Software upgrades

2 things

Implementation

Maintenance and software upgrades

$30K implementation and maintenance $2500 / month. Blended tech + services in those fees

You want to access to EMPI - you have to buy access to it and you get access to download it. Or you could pay us to

Tech scale

Memo similar to DV
