**What is the Network & RX access layer?**
Contracts negotiated and maintained by access layer firms allow us to reach providers and pharmacies, but these companies often use this leverage to impede startups' cost-savings innovations (which would decrease their top-line revenue).

## Slide 6: This stranglehold on access also prevents employers from knowing their true healthcare costs.

offers members the same level of
access and quality of all major
carriers without co-pays and
deductibles, allowing providers to be
paid in full and real time.

*   Building **Full Replacement Networks** in Michigan and Texas
*   Growing to **150K members** by January 2025

### Remove Invented Complexities

| Scenario                               | Buyers pay | Providers collect |
| :------------------------------------- | :--------- | :---------------- |
| **Current (2-9 Months to get paid)**   | $100       | $60               |
| **Nomi (Immediate Payment)**           | $75        | $70               |

**Where does the $40 go?**
**Invented complexity.**
RCM² costs, write offs, denials, collection fees, co-pays, network rental fees, call centers, payment rails, claims adjudication, and merchant fees.

### How are we able to achieve this?

*   **No Patient Responsibility**
    *   Hospitals attribute more than 50% of their commercial bad debt to unpaid patient bills due to the rise of HDHPs³
    *   Providers trade lower upfront rates with Nomi for increased profitability and better operating leverage
*   **No Prior-Auth Burden**
    *   100% of experts prioritized the prior-auth burden as a financial and admin challenge
    *   We eliminate this step, saving providers $ and improving overall satisfaction
*   **Immediate Payment**
    *   Hospitals are traditionally paid within 60 days of service (at best), though sometimes wait as long as 9 months
    *   By fulling settling in near real-time, we give the providers greater predictability into their cash flow

**72% CAGR** (from 2022 to 2025 Revenue)

### 2024 Key Growth Drivers

*   **Network:** Launching our Full Network Replacement product on 04/01/24 which captures 100% of medical spend.
*   **Pharmacy Management:** Caesars, Orchestra, and Wynn among the 100K lives that went live on 01/01/24.
*   **Analytics:** Mercer implementations and market expansion to Stop Loss, States, and TPAs through Global Solutions team.
*   **Financial Services:** Implementation, onboarding, and execution of signed TPA deals.
*   **Integrated Programs:** CareSource implementation with high patient engagement.

### What is NRR and how do we calculate it?

We supplement the traditional financial metrics with **Net Reoccurring Revenue (NRR)**, which strips out pass-through costs common in healthcare and reflects the highly predictable revenue that is common in technology businesses.

**Revenue of Each Business Unit**
- Drug Spend from Pharmacy Mgmt.
- Medical Spend from Network/Int. Programs
= **Net Reoccurring Revenue**

**Footnotes:**
¹Not inclusive of revenue from pandemic operations; ²EBITDA % on NRR, not inclusive of historical COVID EBITDA
