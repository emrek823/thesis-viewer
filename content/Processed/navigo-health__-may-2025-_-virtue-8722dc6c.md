## Slide 2: Summary
* The US Healthcare system largely serves employers, not healthcare consumers, and shifting the buying decision to individuals is our strongest lever to reduce our healthcare spend
* Insurance brokerages are the distribution channel in these markets and can be a force to shape the market the way we believe it should be structured
* Historically these assets have not represented venture economic profiles (EBITDA margins in 20-30% range), and lack the capabilities to deliver more value to the system and unlock larger economic returns
* Advancements in AI enable dramatic transformation of brokerage P&Ls, making these asset strong venture buyout / AI roll up strategy targets, and allow brokers to extend their influence beyond just enrollment
* Successful execution of our strategy will create the chassis to reshape how insurance products are designed, and how healthcare is accessed and delivered

## Slide 4: US healthcare spend is unsustainable
### Health expenditures as percent of GDP, 1970-2022

| Year | United States (%) | Comparable Country Average (%) |
|---|---|---|
| 1970 | ~6.5 | ~5.5 |
| 1975 | ~7.5 | ~6.0 |
| 1980 | ~8.5 | ~6.5 |
| 1985 | ~9.5 | ~7.0 |
| 1990 | ~12.5 | ~7.5 |
| 1995 | ~13.5 | ~8.0 |
| 2000 | ~13.0 | ~8.0 |
| 2005 | ~15.0 | ~9.0 |
| 2010 | ~16.5 | ~10.0 |
| 2015 | ~17.0 | ~10.5 |
| 2020 | ~18.5 | ~11.5 |
| 2022 | ~17.0 | ~11.5 |

## Slide 5: Our system is built around uncompetitive or employer-driven segments, which drives spend trend
### US Health Insurance Segment Membership Mix

| Segment | 2025 Expected (%) | 2035 Desired State (%) |
|---|---|---|
| Individual On Exchange | ~10% | ~20% |
| Individual Off Exchange | ~5% | ~10% |
| ICHRA | ~15% | ~30% |
| Medicare Advantage | ~10% | ~10% |
| Self Insured Employer | ~30% | ~15% |
| Fully Insured Employer | ~20% | ~10% |
| Medicaid | ~5% | ~5% |
| Traditional Medicare | ~5% | ~0% |

Individualized, competitive markets that need to accelerate in adoption

## Slide 6: Brokerages are the insurance distribution channel and are key market-making vehicles
### Broker Enrollment as % of Total Segment Enrollment

| Segment | Broker Enrollment as % of Total Segment Enrollment |
|---|---|
| Individual On Exchange | ~78% |
| Individual Off Exchange | ~85% |
| ICHRA | ~90% |
| Medicare Advantage | ~70% |
| ASO Group | ~95% |
| Fully Insured Group | ~90% |
| Medicaid | ~0% |
| Traditional Medicare | ~5% |

Brokers only sell supplementary products in traditional Medicare and there is no compensation model for them in Medicaid

## Slide 7: We can shape the market to our desired state and drive our spend trend down through two distinct acts
1. Roll up brokerage assets in key segments and transform them via AI. Acquire brokerages in key segments to build a portfolio of brokerage assets built to serve consumers across their lifetime. Leverage Navigo's AI platform to transform these business, and unlock economic returns.
2. Using the leverage our platform provides, build a generational business through the development of products with carriers (potentially taking risk), extending our offering into Admin or Population Health Services, and / or owning care delivery assets to create a vertically integrated experience.

## Slide 8: Brokers are the entry point to healthcare financing, but lack capabilities to unlock larger economic returns and expand their role
### Current Brokerage Challenges
* **Consumer-Focused Brokerage:** lacks scalability, sees material variance in performance from broker to broker, and is generally built around local specialists who sell predominantly one LOB.
* **Employer-Focused Brokerage:** little motivation to move members to individualized segments via an ICHRA, and oftentimes lack awareness that these solutions exist
* **Extension of Services:** each profile lacks the capabilities to extend their services beyond just enrollment, and the industry has historically struggled to enable this despite deep interest from carriers
* **Margin Profile:** average 20-30% margins, with a fairly limited impact on member experience beyond plan selection

## Slide 9: Accelerations in AI, particularly voice and agentic teammates, will enable Gyde to solve these challenges
Prototype in Development

| Current Challenge & Roadmap | Build vs Buy | Module or Solution |
|---|---|---|
| Enrollment and renewals lack scalability and sees material variance in performance by agent | Build | Voice agent module that completes enrollment and renewals for insurance agent |
| Labor intensive customer service | Build or Buy | Build or buy chat and voice functionality to answer basic consumer inquiries |
| Inability to cross sell effectively | Build | Cross sell engine integrated into voice agent to sell ancillary insurance products |
| Difficulty managing appointments, contracts, and compliance by carrier or LOB | Build | Centralized source of truth for tracking appointment and compliance status by carrier, and optimizing contracts for optimal performance |
| Commission tracking and auditing is messy and laborious | Buy | Dynamic auditing function to ensure brokerages get paid on the policies they write |

We will use early customer feedback to iterate on existing modules and identify new ones

## Slide 10: Our vision is to acquire these entities in key segments, and rapidly transform them with the Navigo platform and a value creation playbook

| Target Asset | What we look for | Value creation play(s) paired Navigo platform |
|---|---|---|
| Individual Health FMO | • Mid sized FMO in TX, NC, or FL (less than 250K lives) with call center <br> • Retail brand with local brand equity | • Increase agent counts and LOBs served, particularly ancillary products <br> • Add more robust MA FMO infrastructure to the Individual Health FMO <br> • Renegotiate or optimize carrier and / or FMO contracts |
| Individual Health Brokerage | • Attractive existing CAC to LTV with strong brand or lead gen motion <br> • Heavy cost weighting towards call center / agent commissions or Customer Service | |
| SMB-Focused Brokerage | • SMB focused brokerage in strong ICHRA market (e.g. GA, TX) <br> • Relatively Low ICHRA and Level Funded adoption | • Move Small Group Fully Insured book into ICHRA or Level Funded |
| Life & Ancillary Brokerage | • Attractive CAC to LTV with strong brand or lead gen motion, with focus on middle class segment <br> • Limited or nascent MA business | • Cross sell MA heavily, largely turning the agency into a full scale MA agency <br> • Use our acquired Individual Health FMOs as the MA FMO for these assets |

## Slide 11: Navigo's platform can become a new operating system for insurance brokerages across core focus lines
**Core Focus Lines:**
* Individual Health
* SMB Employer
* Medicare Advantage
* Life & Ancillary

**Navigo Platform Components:**
* Agentic Enrollment & Renewal
* Customer Support
* Cross Sell Engine
* Appointments, Contracting, & Compliance

The combination of these assets and the Navigo Platform allows Navigo to serve a member for life and unlock material operating margin expansion opportunities

## Slide 12: Navigo technology improves brokerage margins 50-70%+ through 2-3 year transformation efforts...

| | Pre Navigo | Post Navigo | Delta | Commentary |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Revenue (Commissions)** | **$10,000,000** | **$12,000,000** | **20%** | • This is an example of Individual Health brokerage's P&L based on conversations in the market, but would note that we've never actually gotten to open the books up of one of these shops <br> • Revenue increases are driven largely by cross selling new products (e.g. Dental, Vision, Life), since we will see ACA market contraction <br> • We are not including any value creation plan components (e.g. human capital optimization, vendor cost renegotiation, etc) to isolate where we think there is true Tech alpha <br> • We believe this is a very achievable destination and may even be conservative when we factor in value from execution of a value creation plan paired with the technology |
| **Expenses** | **$7,000,000** | **$5,925,000** | **-15%** | |
| Marketing | $2,500,000 | $2,500,000 | -% | |
| Call Center Team Comp | $1,500,000 | $750,000 | -50% | |
| Executive & Other Admin Comp | $1,500,000 | $1,500,000 | -% | |
| Customer Service Team Comp | $400,000 | $200,000 | -50% | |
| Technology Team Comp | $400,000 | $400,000 | -% | |
| Licensure & Training | $150,000 | $75,000 | -50% | |
| Office | $150,000 | $100,000 | -33% | |
| Vendor Spend | $100,000 | $100,000 | -% | |
| Legal | $100,000 | $100,000 | -% | |
| Other Miscellaneous | $200,000 | $200,000 | -% | |
| **Estimated EBITDA** | **3,000,000** | **6,075,000** | **103%** | |
| **Estimated EBITDA Margin** | **30.00%** | **50.63%** | **69%** | |

## Slide 13: ... and deliver strong returns to sponsors in Act One, while laying the foundation for Act Two

| | 2H 2025 | 2026 | 2027 | 2028 | 2029 | 2030 | Key Assumptions |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Acquisitions by Year** | | | | | | | • All acquisitions are paid up front in cash, without the use of leverage, seller financing, rolled equity, etc <br> • Acquisitions reach margin maturity (40-50%) in Y3 post acquisition <br> • We assume we only recognize half of the asset economics in Y1 to account for rolling nature of when acquisitions hit our books <br> • FMOs have revenues in the $8-$10M range and trade at 7-9x EBITDA <br> • Agencies have revenues in the $4-$5M range and trade at 4-6x EBITDA <br> • Navigo HoldCo is intended to represent holding company and platform development expenses <br> • The largest platforms in the space trade at 15-20x EBITDA multiples |
| Individual Health FMO | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | |
| Individual Health Agency | 1 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 0 | |
| SMB Agency | 0 | 1 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 0 | |
| Life / MA Agency | 0 | 1 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 0 | |
| **Cash & Acquisition Costs** | | | | | | | |
| Capital Raise | $8 | $35 | $70 | $0 | $0 | $0 | |
| Start of Period Cash | $8 | $38 | $75 | $23 | $3 | $5 | |
| Acquisition Costs | $3 | $32 | $58 | $36 | $25 | $0 | |
| **Navigo Economics** | | | | | | | |
| Asset Revenue | $0 | $12 | $45 | $92 | $129 | $153 | |
| Asset EBITDA | $0 | $4 | $16 | $36 | $57 | $70 | |
| Navigo HoldCo Expenses | $2 | $3 | $4 | $5 | $7 | $8 | |
| Navigo TotalCo EBITDA | -$2 | $1 | $12 | $31 | $50 | $62 | |
| Navigo TotalCo EBITDA %* | -% | 6% | 26% | 34% | 39% | 41% | |
| Navigo TotalCo OCF | -$2 | -$1 | $5 | $16 | $27 | $34 | |
| **Navigo Valuation** | | | | | | | |
| EBITDA Multiple | - | - | 9 | 12 | 15 | 18 | |
| Valuation | - | - | $105 | $372 | $747 | $1,115 | |

*Since we have a three year ramp into EBITDA maturity for these assets, EBITDA runs lower than our destination in this view. If we extend this out, we see margin approach the desired 40-50% + range.

## Slide 17: Challenges we hear from acquisition targets
"Open enrollment has become so short, and my book has become so large, that all I have time for is my renewals. There's limited time to win new business"
"What would be most helpful to me? Marketing, leads, and identifying new growth opportunities. So much of my business is just ACA"
“My business has scaled far beyond what used to be a small mom and pop agency. What back office or supporting platforms do you recommend I use to help me grow efficiently?”
"I'm ready to retire and would like to make sure my clients are taken care of after I exit the business"

## Slide 18: For enrollment and renewal in Consumer LOBs, Navigo Health represents a paradigm shift in insurance distribution
### Call Center Current State
* Tens of agents in a call center fielding new and renewing member calls
* Material performance difference in top quartile vs bottom quartile agents
* Volume and capability caps due to narrow Open Enrollment windows
* Limited cross sell ability due to agent knowledge and comfort

### Future State with Navigo Health
* Single voice agent can handle all new and renewing calls, with ability to take hundreds of calls concurrently
* Consistent performance from call to call across multiple languages
* Near unlimited capacity
* Cross sell engine naturally sells consumer additional products based on demographic information
