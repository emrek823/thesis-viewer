### Business Model and Market Expansion

- Big idea: Takes 8-10 years to take drug to market, 50% of the job is operational work done by expensive PhDs and engineers
	- Filing regulatory reports, statistical process control - all could be done by AI agents with human oversight
	- Don’t need teams of 8 PhDs working for months
- Started focused on biologics and process optimization, built Operational Data Platform
	- Integrations: LIMS (Lab Information Management System), QMS (Quality Management Systems), MES (Manufacturing Executive Systems), CDMO suppliers
	- Built ontology and knowledge graph on top
	- Started with one agent for process optimization, now expanding to multiple workflows
- Agent portfolio evolution:
	- Process optimization - finding inefficiencies in commercial manufacturing
	- Agentic root cause analysis - when something goes wrong
		- BMS example: CAR-T drug worth $500K per dose, 2,000 issues per year need triaging
	- Agentic design of experiments for biotech companies
		- Biotech don’t have money to hire expensive talent with commercial manufacturing experience
		- Giving them expertise they can’t afford or find

### Customer Traction and Go-to-Market Strategy

- Current customers: BMS (closed), GSK (signed MSA), Pfizer (in talks for MSA), Sanofi
	- GSK doesn’t even have yield dashboard - need visibility before optimization
	- Comparing two sites running yield side by side is basic need
- Sales approach: Lead with highest ROI use case
	- mAbs and process optimization: 1.2% improvement on $15B drug = 100x ROI
	- Get wedge with one use case, expand from there (200K to 1M, then 1M to 10M)
- Competitive landscape:
	- Primary competitor: McKinsey Quantum Black (builds solutions for $10M vs Catalyze’s $200K base platform fee)
	- Palantir mentioned but limited pharma market penetration
- CDMO expansion:
	- Northern RNA (mRNA focused), talking to Fujifilm
	- Challenge: Need to sell site-by-site as they own P&L
	- Network effect opportunity: Within Sanofi, can get data directly from CDMOs like Biogen and connect to sponsor

### Financial Metrics and Funding Strategy

- Current traction: $2M ARR, expecting $10M ARR by end of next year
	- Already have bookings starting January 1st for 2M to 3M growth
	- 5x growth target from current base
- Business model structure:
	- $50K-$200K annual base platform fee (low entry point)
	- $50K-$90K per agent (three tiers: light thinking vs deep thinking)
	- Expect ~7 agents minimum per molecule
	- Full capacity: $8-12M per enterprise
- Multiple expansion layers:
	- One agent, one molecule, one site → multiple sites, molecules, agents
	- Commercial manufacturing → CMC → process development
- Raising $8M round
	- Majority spend on product development: more integrations, more agents, different modalities
	- Currently cover biologics, mAbs, CAR-T; want to add small molecules
	- Future focus shift to GTM machine building
