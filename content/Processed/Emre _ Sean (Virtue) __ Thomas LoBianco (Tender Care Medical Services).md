### PPEC Market Overview

- Florida currently has most PPEC patients of any state; lowest reimbursement rate among 15 states with PPEC model
- 58 centers in Miami alone - highly saturated market
- Recent Medicaid audits revealed significant overpayments:
	- One Miami center required to repay $1.9M
	- Another Miami center required to repay $1.2M
- Every state has different licensing regulations and requirements
- Texas recently raised reimbursement to $398/day to address staffing issues and align with PDN rates
- New states planning to adopt PPEC model:
	- Virginia opening PPEC regulations in 2026
	- Missouri developing regulations
	- Ohio working on implementation

- Own property for all centers except one
- Faced significant regulatory challenges in Texas:
	- Building codes more stringent than Florida
	- HHS requires minimum 100 sq ft isolation rooms
	- Strict measurement requirements for hallways/rooms

### Clinical Operations

	- Most centers open 6 days/week
	- Some patients attend Mon-Fri and Saturday
- Staffing challenges:
	- 96% retention rate pre-COVID

	- Cannot compete with hospital pay rates
	- Particularly challenging in Florida due to low reimbursement

	- Led by Jeff (leadership team mentioned)
	- Different service model approach
	- Previously operated as CSI
