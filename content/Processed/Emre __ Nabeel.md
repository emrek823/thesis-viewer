### Current Government Operations & Strategy

- Fleet Health positioning within government agencies
- Shift from multiple enterprise contracts to centralization
	- Previously: Government departments operated separately (like Palantir model)
	- Now: Moving toward centralized Real World Data (RWD) initiatives across agencies
- Current focus on Health and Human Services (HHS) integration
- Building integrations with Academic Medical Centers (AMCs)
	- Bureaucracy is challenging but serves as competitive moat
	- Not aggressively pursuing pharma currently, but have pilot programs planned

### Product Development

- Core product: Data connector system (similar to Palantir’s McGree)
	- Connects to enterprise data systems
	- Iterates on source system data
	- Pulls data into Foundry
- Node-based deployment approach
	- Deploys as node within health systems
	- Connects to multiple data systems
	- Handles de-identification
	- Creates vast connected network
- Architecture: “Physically centralized but logically federated”
	- Preserves data providence through the chain
	- Enables clean, traceable data
	- Allows for additional data pulls when needed

### Future Growth Plans

- Positioning for upcoming fundraise
	- Waiting for government volatility to settle
	- Focused on proving out thesis components
	- JSL currently providing non-dilutive capital
- Planning to expand AI capabilities
	- Deploy AI at individual sites
	- Structure unstructured data
	- Automate health analyst workflows
	- Focus on deployment infrastructure

### Next Steps

- Follow-up meeting to be scheduled in a few weeks
- Potential meeting with Sean (from Virtuevc) in New York next Wednesday (18th)
	- Alternative meeting possible in Austin if NYC timing doesn’t work
