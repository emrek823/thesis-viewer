## Slide 2: It takes 10 years and $1B to develop a single pharmaceutical drug.
It takes 10 years and $1B to develop a single pharmaceutical drug.
30% of that cost & time is driven by slow analysis of data.

*   **The MEANS Procedure**
    *   **Variable** | **N** | **Mean** | **Std Dev** | **Minimum** | **Maximum**
    *   Age | 19 | 13.3157895 | 1.4926722 | 11.0000000 | 16.0000000

## Slide 5: How it works
How it works

**Data Scientist sets up new ML model or analysis.**
**SmartML handles all cloud deployment, tooling, monitoring.**
(Image: A person icon, representing a Data Scientist, points to "SmartML".)

**Hub ties in with your existing data, or provides new data warehouse, and lets users collaborate on data input.**
(Image: Cloud and database icons point to "Hub".)

**Regulatory reports are stored with the results either in Limmi, or your existing data warehouse.**
(Image: A laboratory flask icon points from "SmartRegs" to an implied storage location.)

(Overall diagram shows a central "Hub" connected to external data sources, which feeds into "SmartML". "SmartML" is connected to "SmartRegs", and "SmartRegs" leads to regulatory reports/storage. A data scientist interacts with "SmartML".)
