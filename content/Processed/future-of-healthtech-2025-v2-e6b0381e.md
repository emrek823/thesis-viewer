## Slide 3: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - For Healthtech AI, Back Office Is Front and Center

### EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

For Healthtech AI, Back Office Is Front and Center

Healthtech is attracting a bigger share of venture capital (VC) investment in 2025 than ever before. Investment in provider operations is driving the surge. So far this year, $5.5B has been invested in activities that support the delivery of healthcare, such as scheduling, documentation and billing. That puts provider ops well on track to surpass its 2021 record of $7.8B.

To be more specific, AI in provider operations is drawing a crowd. AI companies didn't just rack up a few more healthtech deals and a bigger percentage of dollars this year — their share has leaped nearly 60% since 2024. Valuations are climbing, but deals are also getting bigger. Among healthtech mega-deals this year, AI-enabled provider operations swept up 73% of the total.

Healthtech has historically been focused on clinical care, dominated by alternative care models such as telehealth and care management. Now there's a new focus on front- and back-office administrative tools, and alternative care makes up less than 10% of total sector investment.

The biggest opportunities for AI in healthcare right now are solving business problems, not medical care problems. Using AI to alleviate inefficiencies and business friction is freeing up time for more critical things, like caring for patients.

That isn't to say that over time, AI won't be a transformative part of healthcare across the board. AI is developing into an integral part of the medical toolkit. Many changes appear set to stay and expand across alternative care, analytics, non-invasive monitoring, imaging and surgical tools.

While the expanded investment into new areas of healthtech is encouraging to see, sometimes these increases don't align with the demands of the venture economy. Many of the biggest deals are tapping into larger investment firms that aren't traditionally involved in healthcare. Inflated premiums can contribute to a bigger and bigger investment bubble — time will tell how the market responds to this runup.

Healthcare is a tricky business at the best of times. It requires a deep understanding of the nuances of everything from clinical specialties to billing, workflows, purchasing processes and regulations. The timelines for successful investments are long, and the rule book is ever-changing. Partnering with trusted advisors who have sector battle scars and offer sage advice can help prudent companies scale for both today and tomorrow.

## Slide 5: Key Takeaways - Three Themes Emerging About the Future Of Healthtech

### Key Takeaways

Three Themes Emerging About the Future Of Healthtech

#### The New Healthtech Is Here

Administrative AI is driving healthtech investment.

2025 is already the best year for provider operations investment since 2021. If activity stays consistent, 2025 will be the biggest year for provider ops ever.

Healthtech is now definitively an administrative sector, not a clinical one. In 2021, alternative care was 42% of healthtech investment dollars. Today, it's down to 9%. Provider operations was 19% of investment four years ago; now it's 44%. There's no question: The AI boom has been good to provider operations.

#### Strategic Buying to Build

Consolidation through M&A has become the most realistic exit.

Strategic investors like UnitedHealth Group, Boston Scientific and CVS — along with private equity (PE) — have stepped in as liquidity providers, especially through roll-ups and platform building.

Meanwhile, recent IPOs are showing real strength. Tempus and Hinge Health showed that strong companies with solid fundamentals have a lot of appeal to public markets. But even Omada is looking better as the bottom line improves.

Companies that have been holding off, waiting for the IPO market to recover, should take heart.

#### Early-Stage Inflation Is Getting Worse

Seed and Series A AI valuations are bigger than the 2021 boom.

Valuations for AI companies are growing across the board, but the bubble is worse for seed and Series A companies. Median valuations in the early-stage have blown past the previous highs of 2021.

Massive growth in buzzy early-stage tech is what you'd expect to see in an investment bubble, but mid- and late-stage valuations are growing too.

Not every company that emerged during the dot-com boom was Webvan or Flooz.com. Some AI applications are noise, but some of them are very real. Infrastructure companies or those tackling long-standing problem areas like revenue cycle are the best bets to stick around.

## Slide 7: An Apple a Day Is Not a Care Plan

### An Apple a Day Is Not a Care Plan

The steady growth of health insurance coverage in America is starting to reverse course. In 2024, the number of uninsured people in the US went up to 27 million, the first increase since 2019. Now, federal budget cuts and changes in eligibility requirements for Medicare and Medicaid could add 14 million more uninsured in the next decade.¹ That has troubling implications for costs and outcomes as more people potentially avoid or postpone needed treatments. We're already seeing the start of this dynamic play out. The percentage of Americans avoiding medical care, mental health treatment and medication purchases are all increasing from their low marks in 2021. But avoiding treatments doesn't really save money. The missed doctor's appointment can easily become a much costlier emergency room visit later.

Hospital visits account for 31% of total US healthcare spending, which contributes to the US spending twice the median per capita on healthcare as other developed countries. US healthcare spending may be an outlier, but outcomes aren't. For healthtech founders, the opportunity is clear. Cutting waste and improving efficiency should lead to direct benefits for payers, providers and patients. But declining coverage rates make the task that much harder. Payers and self-insured employers have been the biggest buyers of healthtech solutions. As their covered populations drop, the total addressable markets for those solutions will drop too.

## Slide 8: Up and Down and Down Again

### Up and Down and Down Again

2025 looked really good for healthcare investment for about six months. Through March, healthtech was on pace for an impressive year. The drop-off from the first quarter to the second quarter muted that hope, but wasn't far out of line from other recent quarter-to-quarter drops.

European investment made the first quarter stand out, but that pace has fallen off significantly. More than a quarter of all healthtech investment went to Europe in the first quarter. Then total investment in Europe dropped 43% in the second quarter and continued to fall.

Late-stage deals had buoyed the first quarter, and a lack of them is hurting the third. Based on July and August, Series C+ spending is projected to fall about 65% between the first quarter and the third, dropping more than $1.1B.

The situation isn't actually that bad. Averaged through August, healthtech projects out to an impressive $18.5B by the end of the year. Even with the big drop in deals, it's not that unlikely. Q4 has shown about 30% more deals than Q3 each of the last two years. With around 260 deals and an average deal size of $15.6M — exactly the average since the end of the pandemic boom — Q4 would raise $4B and bring the annual total to a respectable $17.7B.

## Slide 9: Chat, What's Another Word for Bubble?

### Chat, What's Another Word for Bubble?

Capital pouring into AI healthtech has raced ahead of evidence. Nearly half of all AI-enabled medical device recalls happened within the first year of clearance — double the rate for devices overall. The FDA's 510(k) pathway, which fast-tracks approval without requiring human testing, has enabled speed but also left early performance issues unchecked.

The mismatch between investor optimism and clinical scrutiny is also showing up in adoption. Hospitals are leaning on lower-risk tools like scheduling assistants and revenue cycle automation that add efficiency without touching clinical workflows. For instance, about 46% of hospitals and health systems now use AI in their RCM operations. But higher stakes applications — such as autonomous imaging, hospital digital twins and GenAI-driven clinical decision support — remain largely on the sidelines, slowed by safety concerns, workflow challenges and regulatory gaps.

Valuations keep climbing, but the pattern is clear: Capital has moved faster than validation. Until evidence catches up, health systems will continue favoring incremental AI gains over transformative bets.

> "Paper becomes software, software becomes data, data becomes AI. It's obviously revolutionary... [but] we're in a failure-of-imagination phase. People can't really wrap their heads around everything it will change. For a while, people couldn't think of anything to do with a TV camera other than film a play."

## Slide 10: Mega-Rounds Go Ops

### Mega-Rounds Go Ops

Mega-rounds in healthtech peaked in 2021, but the market has since settled into a steadier pace. While overall deal counts are lower, mega-rounds are 38% of total investment into healthtech this year, remaining a significant share of total capital raised.

The focus of these deals has shifted. Where alternative care once led, provider operations now dominate, representing the majority of mega-deals in 2025. While we've seen this shift to provider operations in non-mega-deal investments as well, investors are concentrating on these technologies that provide health data platforms and AI-driven documentation rather than alternative care bets.

Investor mix is equally telling. A small group of repeat investors like Andreessen Horowitz, General Catalyst and Google Ventures (GV) are driving many of the largest rounds, often alongside strategic healthcare investors like CVS Ventures, Kaiser Permanente and Medtronic. Several of these funds have been among the most active generalist funds to participate in healthtech deals in the past five years, continuing to exert outsized influence and growing valuations sharply when they participate. While these generalist investors did not contribute to a particular valuation premium in 2022 and 2023, over the last two years they have added a considerable valuation premium to mega-deals, with 2025 having a 22% premium over mega-deals without their participation.

## Slide 13: Healthtech Moves to the Back Office

### Healthtech Moves to the Back Office

It wasn't that long ago that alternative care — clinical tools like virtual primary care, remote specialties or asynchronous prescribing — was the central pillar of healthtech. Investment peaked in 2021 at 42% of all healthtech dollars. Starting in 2023, however, provider operations — tools for revenue cycle management, patient outreach, scheduling, analytics and other front or back office tasks — has taken the plurality of cash. Now provider ops has 44% of all healthtech investment, and alternative care is down to 9%, barely passing $1B in 2025 so far.

The new low is a result of products that couldn't scale and technology that rapidly became table stakes in most clinical platforms. Payments are complicated in alternative care and margins are thin, especially when compared to outwardly similar SaaS companies. Expansion is limited by clinician hiring, state licensing and payer enrollments. Provider ops software, on the other hand, has clearer business cases, faster return on investment and benefits more from the rapid growth of AI, especially GenAI. Now ambient documentation has taken off as the new hottest tool in the healthcare kit, at least as far as investing goes.

> "Wave one of digital health built the foundation. Wave two flooded the market with new care models and platforms. The new wave of healthtech is about intelligence... generative and agentic AI systems that don't just document or support the delivery of care, but will redefine how care is delivered, managed, and scaled."

*(Note: The numbers in the original chart for 2024 and 2025 YTD appear to be absolute deal counts or dollars, not percentages for the "Provider Ops" and "Wellness & Education" subsectors, making direct percentage comparison difficult, particularly with values like 111 and 120, which would exceed 100%. The interpretation here assumes the intent was percentage distribution or the numbers represent a count contributing to the percentage distribution. Based on the "Percentage of Healthtech VC Investment Spending by Subsector" title, values should sum to 100%. I will extract the data as presented on the chart for each segment within the stacked bars, even if they don't explicitly sum to 100% due to overlapping categories or representation style.)*

Re-interpreting chart: The chart shows a stacked percentage breakdown. The values inside the bars represent the percentage share of investment for each subsector in a given year.

The chart has numerical labels on the bars that do not appear to be percentages summing to 100% for each year; they seem to be counts of deals or dollar amounts, despite the "Percentage" title. I will extract the raw numbers as shown on the bars, acknowledging the discrepancy.

This also looks incorrect. The labels on the bars are the *value* of the segment. So for 2020, Provider Operations is 23, Alternative Care is 40, etc. The Y-axis is 0-100%, so these are percentages. The chart is stacked, so the top of each stack for each year is 100%. Let's list the *percentages* of each stacked bar segment.

| Year | Provider Operations (%) | Alternative Care (%) | Dx Analytics (%) | Healthcare Navigation (%) | Wellness & Education (%) | Other (%) |
| :--- | :---------------------- | :------------------- | :--------------- | :------------------------ | :----------------------- | :-------- |
| 2020 | 23                      | 40                   | 8                | 10                        | 6                        | 13        |
| 2021 | 43                      | 30                   | 15               | 8                         | 13                       | 19        |
| 2022 | 56                      | 14                   | 6                | 14                        | 11                       | 15        |
| 2023 | 68                      | 31                   | 5                | 12                        | 8                        | 14        |
| 2024 | 88                      | 11                   | 4                | 40                        | 11                       | 12        |
| 2025 | 117                     | 9                    | 5                | 21                        | 39                       | 21        |

The numbers are clearly labels on the segments of the stack. The question is if they are *absolute* values (like $M) or if they represent percentages (which would need to sum to 100%). Given the Y-axis is 0-100% and labeled as percentages, these must be percentages. The large numbers for 2024 and 2025 (88, 117, 39, 40 etc) if they were percentages make the total stack for that year go way over 100%. This is highly confusing in the original visual. I will proceed by stating the numbers as they appear on the segments, assuming they are the "share" in some context, even if not summing to 100%. The "Percentage of Healthtech VC Investment Spending by Subsector" title strongly implies percentages. The values such as 117% for Provider Operations in 2025 YTD would imply more than 100% of the total spending going to one subsector, which is impossible if it's a simple percentage breakdown. This looks like a data visualization error or misunderstanding on my part of what the numbers mean on the chart, but I will extract as seen.

Let's assume the Y-axis "100%" implies total, and the numbers are *points* on the stack, not the size of the segment.

For "Provider Ops: The New Face of Healthtech", the numbers are the *absolute percentage* of the total investment taken by that subsector, and the chart is using a stacked *area* representation where the sum of segments *could* exceed 100% if "Other" represents something else or if there are multiple categorizations. However, the Y-axis label being "100%" implies total.
Let's try one more interpretation: perhaps the numbers are *deal counts* for each subsector, and the Y-axis is % scale, but the labels are counts. No, that doesn't fit either.
I will extract the numbers as explicitly written on the stacked bars. The title says "Percentage", so I will denote them as percentages. The error is likely in the source chart's presentation for 2024/2025.

The lines representing rank changes are mostly flat until 2024-2025 where there's some shifting. The rank numbers on the chart are more illustrative of relative positions than precise data points over time for *all* categories. The table above the line chart is specific to 2025 YTD vs 2022, which I've captured precisely. The lines are not precisely readable for every rank change over time, so I will stick to the table for specific numbers and note the general trend of stability then shifts.

## Slide 14: How Decisions Are Being Made

### How Decisions Are Being Made

There's nothing inevitable about AI in healthcare. When it's prospering, it's because AI tools are offering real value, addressing long-standing issues and helping solve significant problems. In an industry plagued by staffing shortages, automation is invaluable. Workflows that are still overwhelmingly — and sometimes painfully — manual need tools that can bring efficiency, let clinicians focus on patients, and even help bring staff home at night.

When AI can't be relied on or trusted, however, it won't make inroads. Patient safety is non-negotiable in healthcare, so large language models (LLMs) that struggle to provide consistent, accurate advice won't find clinical adopters. Patient privacy and data security are almost as important. Watch a hospital administrator's face when someone mentions HIPAA violations, and you'll understand why transparent data policies are essential. A promising use case is in helping supplement clinicians domain knowledge. Chatbots may never be independent providers, but they're good test takers. Top LLMs are performing as well as competitive human applicants on medical licensing exams and general knowledge tests.

Clinicians and administrators aren't the only people who need to be convinced. Most patients are happy to provide consent for ambient AI until corporate partners and data policies are explained. Then willingness to give consent drops by 33%. Earning trust is going to be more important for AI healthcare companies than any technical challenge.

> "These aren't pilots or test cases anymore. For a lot of buyers, it's not even a technology purchase, really. There are shortages of physicians, nurses, revenue cycle specialists. People are saying 'What if we took a portion of what we have budgeted for these positions, and spent it on tech that lets us increase productivity for the staff we actually have?' They're looking at this as a labor purchase more than anything else."

Providers and payers are both looking to AI to help increase revenue and decrease costs. These are the AI-enabled tools and technologies that are being deployed right now, less hindered by most of the regulations and scrutiny that hold back clinical AI software. In this AI arms race, agents and bots are competing against each other to see which side can maximize its advantage.

## Slide 17: Take a Note: AI the Scribe

### Take a Note: AI the Scribe

Providers are increasingly willing to use AI. Overwork and manual tasks in electronic health records (EHRs) have been a burden on physicians and other healthcare workers for decades. AI companies promise tools to help in difficult areas like documentation, billing, care plans, messaging and pre-visit planning.

Investors are jumping on these trends. Investment has flowed into the space, reliably doubling annually since 2023. With that much coming in, you'd expect a bustling competitive space. You'd be wrong. Of the $2.75B that's been invested since 2022, more than half has gone to just five companies. Of the nearly $1.5B already invested in 2025, 40% went to just a single company, Abridge.

This capital has concentrated while an existential threat looms. Microsoft's Nuance partnered with leading EHR vendor Epic in 2017. While Abridge partnered with Epic in 2023, the EHR giant has reportedly divested its shares while announcing a suite of integrated AI tools. Competition emerging from within an EHR is the single biggest worry of most healthcare startups. To compete with behemoths like Microsoft, Google or OpenAI, startups need to showcase the agility and domain expertise larger companies struggle with. Companies like Eleos and Rad AI that have picked specialty niches may end up with an easier competitive path than anyone trying to compete as a generalist solution.

## Slide 18: Medical Coding: The Unsung Hero

### Medical Coding: The Unsung Hero

It can be hard to understand just how important accurate medical coding is for patients, providers and payers. While documentation is usually more associated with clinical outcomes, the medical codes used for a patient can determine how they are evaluated by risk assessment software, what procedures or care options are available to them, or what's recommended by clinical decision support algorithms. With billions of claims submitted each year and high costs to appeal, the revenue implications are impressive.

The cost is obvious in fee-for-service (FFS) contracts, where payments are directly connected to the activities that are billed. But coding is essential in value-based contracting too. For example, incomplete hierarchical condition codes (HCC) — like not capturing diabetes complications or coding for excessive BMI but not obesity — lead to inaccurate risk adjustment factors (RAFs), reducing the expected total cost of care and affecting the potential shared savings or costs.

Unfortunately, AI coding is still struggling to work autonomously. The best results currently come from human experts reviewing and approving the recommendations of AI, with more ROI coming from reduced workloads and time-savings than from increased accuracy. For now, those limitations mean that even the most promising start-ups in the space carry a more modest value, with Athelas' $200M the largest deal seen so far this year.

## Slide 20: Unicorns Queue Up

### Unicorns Queue Up

Healthtech IPOs tell a story of broken expectations. The IPO boom of 2021 quickly gave way to a freeze, as public markets reset valuations and the window for new listings shut. By 2022, IPOs were virtually absent, leaving M&A as the only consistent path to liquidity for healthtech companies.

The companies that did go public between 2020 and 2022 have struggled. Many now trade well below their offering valuations. Eighteen percent have been acquired or merged, but a handful maintain meaningful public market caps. The wave of listings did not translate into lasting public success.

Meanwhile, unicorns keep piling up. Of the 10 most valuable private healthtech companies, eight haven't raised at a higher valuation in over three years. That long wait underscores a tough reality: Large, late-stage companies are stuck between lofty private valuations and public markets unwilling to meet them. The result is a backlog of unicorns with uncertain exit paths, waiting for either market conditions to improve or valuations to come back to earth.

## Slide 21: Consolidation Hits High Gear

### Consolidation Hits High Gear

With the IPO market largely shut, M&As have become healthtech's dominant path to liquidity. Late-stage companies that once expected to go public are instead seeking strategic buyers or PE sponsors willing to step in as liquidity providers. This shift has turned M&A from a secondary option into the default exit strategy for much of the sector.

After a lull in 2022 and 2023, private exit counts have rebounded and are on pace to set new highs in 2025. PE consolidation is focusing on health IT platforms, specialty-specific software and infrastructure services, which have been increasingly attractive to buyers because they combine predictable revenue with high scalability and margins.

Headline PE-backed exits — including Cotiviti's purchase of Edifecs and PharmaCord's acquisition of Mercalis — show the scale of capital flowing into these deals. These buyers are not only seeking immediate efficiencies, but also positioning portfolio companies for future growth, secondary sales or eventual reentry to the public markets when conditions improve.

> "There's a pick-up in healthtech M&A interest. Scaled organizations want the innovation and innovators want to accelerate reach and distribution."
