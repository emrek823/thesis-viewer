"The best time to plant a tree is twenty years ago, the next best time is now.” – Chinese Proverb

Dear Partners,

What about China?

It is a straightforward question, but one that hasn't left our minds for very long since we opened our doors at Ribbit. Discussing new themes and ideas... what about China? Looking for inspiration for your product roadmap... what about China? Trying to understand how AI could change finance... what about China? Wondering what will make crypto markets move this year... what about China? Debating the most important bets we can make on the future of fintech... what about China?

For a group that spends nearly all of our waking hours obsessing over how software entrepreneurs can build new financial brands, "what about China?" keeps popping up for good reason. When it comes to fintech, China has been bigger and badder than any other place on the planet, ground zero for what is possible in a world bubbling over with data and smartphones. In a span of less than ten years, over $400B of market cap has been created by Chinese fintech entrepreneurs. And the scale - of population, spending, and technological adoption – boggles the mind: in 2018, 1.2 billion unique mobile subscribers conducted $41.5T of mobile payments across 60 billion transactions (nearly 40x the levels of mobile payments seen in the U.S.); 583 million of those people used a smartphone to make a payment at point of sale instead of using cards or cash. As Connie Chen succinctly articulated: "if you took China's total population and subtracted out the entire population of the United States, you would still have a billion people left."

Why, then, is China still outranked in Ribbit's portfolio by Argentina, Chile, Ohio, and New Jersey? For one, the rest of the world has just kept us busy - China may be a giant mountain, but there have been other attractive and more accessible peaks. There have also been good reasons to believe China would make for a treacherous ascent. Everywhere we invest, regulation has a role to play, competitors arise in response to early success, market leaders command high valuations, and entrepreneurs sell vision on top of reality. In China, regulators often have the starring role, competitors emerge like rabbits in Spring, every company is priced like a market leader, and reality often blurs in the intense speed and desire to win. Considered altogether, we have approached China with caution (a mode that does not come naturally to us, as you know), heeding Buffet: "if you've been in the game 30 minutes and you don't know who the patsy is, you're the patsy."

Since we hate losing at poker, China is one place where our time and dollars invested have not been correlated. We have taken more than a dozen trips to China since 2012 and found immense inspiration: from the hard-working, 996 culture; from the ambition, velocity, and ask-for-forgiveness approach of entrepreneurs with different regulatory and capital constraints; and from the product, data, and marketing insights learned from serving hundreds of millions of smartphone users. With our aspiration to be the leading firm at the intersection of tech and finance globally - a firm that scours the earth for the most attractive returns for our partners - we have always thought of China not as an "if" but as a "when."

In recent months, we have been digging deeper on China, driven in part by our own reflection on the future of fintech. When we picture the list of the top 20 fintech brands in 20 years, several of them will have gotten their start, their inspiration, their technology, or their capital in China. Our interest has also been driven by shifting market sentiment. As of late, the trade has become a lot less crowded. Many are assuming the fintech revolution is over in China. Whereas China in 2014 felt like the most consensus bet in fintech, today it has taken on the notable aroma of investor disdain.

Over the Last Year, Chinese Fintech Has Fallen (Far) From Favor

Against this backdrop - excited when others are not, but still keenly aware of China's unique - challenges - we are once again asking ourselves "what about China?" Since it remains an open question internally, we decided to write this letter to share our thinking about why it might be time to plant the Ribbit flag.

Three Reasons Why China Is Hard to Ignore If You're a Global Fintech Investor

Since most of you know a thing or ten about China, we will keep the level-setting brief. But we wanted to describe the playing field, with a bit of context on why fintech in China is already such a big deal.

China is the #2 financial services market and the #2 software/internet market in the world

Reliably measuring Chinese financial services is notoriously difficult, but by any global comparison the industry is massive.1 China is home to four of the world's top ten banking services and three of the top ten insurance companies. At current growth rates, Chinese financial services – nominally valued today at $2.4T (16% of GDP) vs. $4T (19% of GDP) in the U.S. – is on track to become the largest in the world in the next two decades.

This high-level view understates the opportunity in consumer and SMB finance. On average, Chinese consumers spend roughly 25%, 15%, and 10% as much on banking, investing and insurance as U.S. consumers. Despite the massive difference in population, Chinese insurers and securities firms earn 50% and 16% as much revenue, respectively, as their U.S. counterparts. If consumer financial services penetration grows to even one-third the level of the U.S. as the Chinese economy matures, industry-wide revenue will expand by $1.3T.

The Chinese software and internet industries are similarly becoming a commanding global force. Nearly half of the top 25 most valuable tech companies in the world are Chinese. While still lagging the U.S. in the number of large startups built in the last decade (150 unicorns in the U.S. vs. 80 in China), China has outpaced the rest of the world combined.

So, to not let what's obvious prevent us from saying what's important: the size of the prize where financial services and software meet in China should be pretty large in the years ahead.

Chinese fintech has grown explosively in the last decade, leapfrogging the rest of the world

Today, the equity value of the Chinese fintech ecosystem is approaching half a trillion dollars. While we estimate U.S. fintech companies from the same period at roughly equal value2, the Chinese fintech market has easily been the most dynamic in the world in recent years.

For one, China is home to the two most formidable global fintech companies founded since 2000. Today, Ant Financial (the parent company of Alipay, spun off from Alibaba in 2015) and WeChat Pay (the payments platform embedded in Tencent's WeChat) have over 700M and 800M users, respectively, making them the largest closed payments networks in the world. Each have expanded to facilitate access to a range of financial products (e.g. lending, investment, insurance) and are ubiquitous across online and offline commerce. Ant, the more aggressive of the two in providing financial services, combines elements of Paypal, Square, Experian, and Affirm under one roof.

More broadly, fintech has had far greater reach in China. Consider a few examples: WeChat has 25x as many MAUs as Venmo; PPDai has 6x the number of borrowers as Lending Club; ZhongAn has touched over 100x the number of customers as all U.S. insuretechs; Ant processes over 3x as much volume as Paypal and 10x as much as Stripe - and manages 4x as much AUM as all U.S. wealth management startups combined. And more customers and transactions means (often exponentially) more data.

And Chinese fintech companies have grown faster. Eight of the top ten Chinese fintech companies of the past quarter century - versus four of the top ten U.S. fintech companies - have been built in the last ten years. On average, fintech unicorns reached the $1B valuation mark two years faster in China than the U.S. This relative youth should prove critical in coming years; "legacy" fintech companies like Paypal and Intuit may struggle with outdated technology while players with more modern software architectures move nimbly into new segments and adjacencies.

As others scramble to catch up, the benefits of China's fintech leapfrogging - the data, infrastructure, and consumer behavior conditioning - may only compound and cause China to pull further ahead.

The stakes are high in Chinese fintech – for regulators, entrepreneurs, and investors

With the benefit of hindsight, it is possible to see how ready China was for fintech. In a decade, mobile broadband subscribers burst to 900M people, creating a vast, accessible customer base. High bank and debit card penetration (>2x U.S. levels)3 enabled low-cost and digital onboarding, KYC, and funding. Underdeveloped credit infrastructure (<20% bureau coverage) and low credit card adoption (10% of U.S. levels) left consumers credit-hungry and open to new payment methods. Resourceful entrepreneurs saw a once-in-a-generation gap and used technology and hustle to fill it.

Regulators had a lot riding on fintech too. For most of the last ten years, they favored growth in credit and consumption, and the regulatory climate was permissive; many fintech entrepreneurs got licenses (200+ granted nationally from 2009 to 2015) while others operated freely in gray areas with plans to ask for forgiveness rather than permission. When we started traveling to China in 2013, we were shocked by the speed with which entrepreneurs were moving - we knew few founders elsewhere who would be quite so daring (or reckless, in many cases). A common goal we heard was to grow "too big to fail" with the aim of being grandfathered into a future equilibrium. By 2016 and 2017, regulators began to see more problems than gain in fintech's excesses. The market turned almost overnight.

P2P lending has most embodied this struggle between risk and reward for Chinese fintech regulators and entrepreneurs. With few consumer protections and mammoth demand for credit, P2P in China grew wildly. By 2017, P2P lenders in China served over 14M borrowers and 13M lenders, more than 6x and 20x the customer base of U.S. counterparts. Like in the highly retail-driven Chinese equity markets, P2P lenders relied on consumers for financing (90% retail vs. 30% in the US). In many ways, this gave entrepreneurs a freer hand and faster feedback loops on new ideas, messages, and products. But it also fostered fraud, uneven underwriting, asset-liability mismatches, and the risk of mom-and-pop investors losing money. In the last 24 months, regulators clamped down with capital requirements, funding restrictions, and rate caps. Two-thirds of P2P platforms went out of business.

Fintech in China is a high stakes game like nowhere else - inextricably linked to broader oscillations between growth, stability, and reform. This makes the opportunities both larger and riskier.

Three Reasons the Market is Bearish on Chinese Fintech

After that brief tour through fintech, you might imagine that Chinese fintech founders are enjoying a golden era, awash in the glow of market praise and swimming in capital. Or (since we already have blown the surprise) you might know this could not be further from the truth at the moment. We'll take a moment to look at three of the key reasons why sentiment on fintech in China is so low right now.

Chinese Fintech and Financial Services Companies Have Hit a Great Wall

The dominance of the large platforms may leave little oxygen for entrepreneurs

The most common refrain in Chinese fintech today is that the large internet companies (Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent, and JD) and their fintech satellites (e.g. WeBank, JD Finance) will dominate the market for years to come, leaving little room for new entrants. Many believe that entrepreneurs will struggle to compete unless they give a large share of their economics or cap tables to the giants.

There are good reasons to believe this. The Chinese internet industry is highly concentrated; BATJ directly or indirectly control a majority of market share in every major tech vertical. Many customers reach all of these functions through a single app (why the world has become fond of calling WeChat a "super-app"). The result is the stuff of data-nerds' dreams and dystopians' nightmares – for many customers, Ant or WeChat might hold much of the same information as a Chase (e.g. credit, assets, income, expenses), an Amazon (e.g. the movies you watch, places you travel, toiletries you buy), a Facebook (e.g. your friends, likes, and interests), and an Uber (e.g. your location, destinations) combined. Putting these data sources together enables sophisticated personalization and risk management, driving more volume and an accelerating AI/ML flywheel. Given limited credit infrastructure, the relative advantage over others in the market is even greater.

Further, unlike in the US, where large tech players have preserved ad-supported models and avoided regulation, the Chinese internet giants have embraced more integrated financial services. For example, Tencent was able to build WeBank into a $21B powerhouse in less than five years, in large part by developing a killer lead product – WeiLiDai ("Micro Particle Loan") - and then promoting it actively on WeChat's home screen to 800M MAUs. Similarly, Ant rapidly scaled its checkout financing product, HuaBei ("Just Spend It"), to hundreds of millions of Taobao and TMall users.

While thoughtfully underwriting BATJ risk/relationships will be part and parcel of any Chinese investment, we take comfort on a couple of points. First, companies like Bytedance ($75B valuation competing with Tencent) or Pinduoduo ($38B valuation, now more GMV than JD) suggest that China remains a dynamic tech market with room to build large new companies. Second, supposed Internet monopolies have a storied history of sowing the seeds of competition on their own platforms (e.g. Meituan, Zynga, Instagram). So the question for Chinese fintech entrepreneurs is likely less whether the giants prevent them from getting momentum - in fact, they should be able to do this on top of WeChat or Alipay - and more how to avoid being coopted or ceding their economics over time. Third, regulators have shown their teeth lately not just to fly-by-night P2P platforms but also to BATJ. Ant and Tencent, for example, both have faced government pressure to focus more on technology services, dialing back licensed/proprietary financial services activity. While it is premature for optimism, the government's actions leave open the possibility of a more pro-innovation approach in the long run.

Tightening fintech regulations may strangle innovation

While regulation is a central fact of life for nearly every fintech company, the stroke of the pen risk looms larger for founders in China than pretty much anywhere else. This has been vividly on display in the P2P market, as discussed earlier, with regulators dramatically curtailing the industry's prospects.

While the regulatory environment for Chinese fintech offered reason for cautious optimism in 2010-2015 – a time during which the perception of freedom to define or bend the rules gave birth to a great deal of innovation - the past two years have confirmed many investors' fears. When Xi Jinping presented the 13th Five Year Plan in 2017, he reinforced a shift that was already underway, with financial stability (and strengthening party leadership over the financial system) replacing financial innovation as the top priority. As a symbol of this change, the party created a Financial Stability Committee to oversee the banking, insurance, and securities regulators. Since then, there has been a precipitous drop in licensing and a series of new rules across payments, lending, and insurance that have centralized control (including creating a single banking/insurance regulator, combining the CBRC and CIRC into CBIRC). These changes have largely pushed activity back into the comfortable confines of licensed institutions, limiting innovation in marketing, underwriting, collecting and moving funds.4

For most investors, the consequences of regulator's actions are clear: higher barriers to entry, more expensive licensing and capital requirements, and growing compliance costs. Further, slowing down challengers creates room for established financial services and tech players to incubate their own efforts (e.g. CMB Consumer Finance Company, Bank of China Consumer Finance Company) or set up fintech subsidiaries (e.g. Baidu Financial, JD Digit, Didi Finance). In short, it's good to be a bank again.

While there is no denying the primacy of regulatory risk in China, we see the current situation with less pessimism than most. For one, critical infrastructure becoming more regulated may actually create a more level playing field. For instance, by forcing Ant and Tencent to participate in a new central payments clearinghouse (Wanglian, aka Nets Union Clearing Corp) and a new credit bureau (Baihang Credit Bureau), regulators coopted potential credit monopolies.5 More broadly, while it may be getting tougher to access licenses, there are offsetting trends: first, licensed institutions are getting better at making their platforms available to founders; secondly, some of the most interesting innovations we are seeing today are at the application layer, leveraging other peoples' licenses.

Moreover, while regulators are tightening the screws in some areas, in others they are taking action to support innovation. To pick a few examples, regulators are publicly committed to systemic deleveraging (benefiting capital markets and asset management), the growth of protection-led insurance products (benefiting insurance and wealth management), and AI (benefiting most fintech innovators). Many feel that the decision to keep the CSRC independent from CBIRC, for instance, demonstrates a clear commitment to fostering capital markets innovation, as do recent PBOC announcements of plans to lift some restrictions on foreign investment in the Chinese financial sector.

5 While only shareholders of each system (i.e. licensed banks and bureaus) have access today, the stated intention is to increase transparency and avoid data siloes.

Investor sentiment may become a self-fulfilling prophecy

If you spoke with us after any of our trips to China from 2013-2016, the first thing we would have talked about were the valuations. The valuations! We would meet entrepreneurs with one hundred small consumer loans on their books and $100M+ valuations. The assumption seemed to always be that Chinese financial services was such a gold rush that you could earn venture returns at just about any price. Nearly every two- or three-year old fintech company we met was planning on going public in the U.S. (or, depending on the trip, on the A Shares market) in the next 12 months.

Today, Chinese fintech entrepreneurs no longer have access to the kind of easy money that stoked the ambitions of founders five years ago. In the private markets, the leading venture firms have all but abandoned fintech at the moment; 2019 YTD funding is on pace to be less than 25% of 2018 – and back to levels below 2013, despite a nearly 10-fold growth in overall VC funding since then. Public markets have pummeled listed Chinese fintech companies, driving returns down as much as 50-80%. And the sentiment has been exacerbated by the overhang on Chinese financial services more broadly; most Chinese banks trade below book value today, well below international peers.

In this environment - and with a consensus belief in the competitive power of the large fintech platforms - what capital is flowing into fintech has become increasingly concentrated. In 2018, the top five fintech companies in China gobbled up nearly three-quarters of total funding to fintech companies, versus 19% in the U.S. All told, the deck looks increasingly stacked against new fintech entrepreneurs trying to get their start in China, particularly where early capital is a strategic asset for the company (e.g. for entrepreneurs trying to get licensed, build networks, go toe-to-toe with incumbents, etc.).

Of course, for us, limited capital and lower valuations can also mean higher prospective future returns. While the go-big-or-go-home strategies that populated the landscape in 2014 or 2015 may no longer work, our experience is that resourceful entrepreneurs can prosper in lean times, often by exercising greater fiscal discipline and focusing on technology and product development rather than land grabs.

Investors in Chinese fintech in the coming years should come prepared for the possibility of staying in a lonely trade. On the other hand, the Chinese venture capital market is here to stay. Whatever the short-term sentiment around fintech, over 30% of global venture capital dollars in 2018 were invested in Chinese companies. In a market that can support multiple $10B+ and $100B+ technology companies, capital will eventually find its way to teams showing velocity and sensible economics.

Finally, while regulatory barriers may be high, in other respects it has never been more efficient to build fintech services in China. With ubiquitous, on-demand infrastructure accessible by API, ranging from payments (Alipay, WeChat Pay) to cloud services (Tencent, Alibaba, PingAn) to banking (XW Bank), the cost of starting a fintech company is a fraction of what it was even five years ago. In recent months, we have met entrepreneurs who have built full-fledged fintech apps, leveraging other companies' infrastructure and licenses, with less than a few million dollars.

Three Reasons Why We Remain Bullish on China

Irrespective of your view on regulation, competition, or the funding environment, one truth is undeniable to anyone who has been watching Chinese fintech closely for the past decade: China is home to a large number of capable entrepreneurs. In fintech specifically, we have seen an exciting evolution. While the first generation of fintech founders emerged from financial institutions or technology companies (ex. Wenjie Xiao, founder of Lexin, formerly at Tencent; or Caofeng Liu, CTO at Rong360, formerly at Baidu) - the second generation are coming from those same early fintech winners (ex. Wenhuai Lian, the CRO at QuantGroup, formerly part of building Qudian).

When considering this depth of talent, we have little doubt that some important fintech companies will be built in China in the coming years - the market is too deep for hungry entrepreneurs not to find openings. Of course, the right conditions can mean the difference between respectable and smashing success. Here are three main reasons why we still think founders will have the wind at their back.

Nowhere are the fundamental conditions for fintech stronger

At the heart of the global opportunity in fintech lies the ability to use modern software to provide more value and a better experience to consumers. Doing this typically involves three main things 1) transitioning the user journey to frictionless, on-demand digital experience 2) delivering a deep level of personalization, using data to offer the best product at the lowest available rate 3) lowering the cost to serve and passing the value onto the customer. While the U.S., Europe, and other markets slowly evolve into a world of freely flowing financial data and funds – a process which is underway but will take many years to come to reach its potential - China is, in most respects, already there.

It is faster and easier to open a financial account and move money in China than pretty much anywhere else. WeChat, Alipay, and others have spent billions training consumers to use modern, real-time payment networks and complete transactions on smartphones. Entrepreneurs can enable these payments - programmable, if they like, with logic embedded in QR codes (e.g. offers, invoices, receipts) - with a simple API. Digital KYC is standard, supported by a number of sophisticated vendors who make the process invisible. For the next wave of Chinese founders, getting consumers or SMBs to complete fully digital transactions (e.g. buy insurance, buy a house, invest) will be routine.

Further, this shift has conditioned Chinese consumers to expect native digital finance. 70% of Alipay users (a majority of China) have used more than three financial services in the app. This cuts across demographics; when we lined up the checkout at a Hema Supermarket on our last trip to Beijing, everyone - including people in their 50s, 60s, and 70s - paid with their phone. With time, why would these consumers expect anything less than applying for a mortgage, closing, and funding from their phone? Or buying a wealth or insurance product from a finely-tuned algorithm or chatbot?

The data informing these transactions is being reimagined for a digital world as well. Ten years ago, nearly a billion people in China did not have a credit history. This is changing rapidly. Aided by user's complicity (Chinese consumers report much higher willingness to share data with tech apps), Banks, P2P lenders, fintech and tech companies have collected vast troves of data – white and black lists, purchase and repayment histories, location and phonebook information, to name a few – and turned them into credit scores. While the central bank database only covers the official credit history of about 400M people (35% of the population, versus 92% in the US), Alibaba's alternative credit score, Sesame Credit, covers 700M people today. So while these new systems still face many challenges - e.g. proving reliability through credit cycles, demonstrating fairness in ML-based models – they may prove more inclusive and effective than those existing in the U.S, Europe, and other geographies today.

And these developments in credit scoring are just one part of a broader effort to utilize AI/ML techniques in China. This work is happening all over the world, but typically with greater speed and urgency in China, aided by lax privacy laws and consumers' willingness to share their immense digital footprints. Ethical questions aside, Chinese fintech founders should find that they have a freer hand in figuring out how to build the world's most effective AI-based financial products.

Lastly, China's financial institutions appear hungry to work with technology partners. For example, a number of Chinese banks are working closely with digital lenders to underwrite credit, particularly in segments where the banks historically had little presence. In the credit card space, for one, bank issuance has accelerated substantially since 2017, growing 20% across all banks in 2018 (vs. 5% in 2016) with some smaller banks growing 40% or more. A company like Qudian, one of China's public digital lenders, has shifted their efforts to working more closely with banks, both to access low cost capital to serve their 70M users and to help banks serve their own customers better. In 2018, 49% of Qudian's funding came from banks and consumer finance companies up from 18%, with loan facilitation revenue growing 6x from 302M RMB to 1.6B RMB.

China has the talent, capital, and infrastructure to build large companies

When you step back from short-term sentiment, China is still one of the two best places in the world to build big companies fast. To nurture multi-billion-dollar business from scratch, founders need access to a lot of talent, know-how, capital, and customers. China has all four in spades.

The idea of an American monopoly on building companies that reach venture scale or solve hard technical problems is a thing of the past. China today produces nearly double the number of STEM graduates as India and eight times as many as the United States. These graduates can stay in China and work on cutting-edge technology, ranging from computer vision to intelligent robotics. Tens of thousands of them have experienced "blitzscaling" at companies like Alibaba, Tencent, Meituan, JD and Bytedance - the kind of places that (like Intel, Google, Facebook, Paypal in Silicon Valley) tend to spin off many alumni founders. Consider, for example, Shen Peng, who was early at Meituan (a company known for relentless execution) before founding Shuidi, a crowdfunding/health insurance business; in under three years, Shuidi has attracted 200M users and 70M mutual insurance participants.

Further, the vibrancy of Chinese tech has made it more common for talent trained outside of China to return. For example, across Chinese fintech you find hundreds of Capital One alums who learned risk management at perhaps the top global credit organization of the last fifty years. Many of these folks have now been able to combine their historical expertise with learnings from a few years of operating under a different set of opportunities and constraints in China's data-rich ecosystem. In the future, we suspect Capital One will scramble to pay top dollar to hire them back.

As for capital, after the U.S., the number of Chinese venture firms and venture investment in China exceeds the next closest region (Europe) by a factor of four. In 2018, Chinese venture funding exceeded $100B, just under the U.S. total in a record year for both. With the growth of large international technology investors (e.g. Softbank), capital is certainly becoming more global, but it still concentrates where investors know there are proven paths to building massive companies.

Lastly, while BATJXBPP (adding in Xiaomi, Bytedance, Pinduoduo, and PingAn here) may be competitive threats for ambitious entrepreneurs, they are also powerful platforms for reaching customers. Whereas a Chinese fintech entrepreneur ten years ago had to build their businesses largely through feet-on-the-street, today they can reach more users than they will ever need through digital channels. Mini-programs, where developers can bypass mobile app stores and build a lightweight apps within WeChat and Alipay, are particularly powerful. Much as we have seen entrepreneurs in the U.S. build "mobile-first" companies on top of Google and Apple, we are seeing entrepreneurs in China building "mini-program-first" applications, accessing tools like identity, credit scoring, fraud, and payments natively within WeChat or Alipay. As of end of 2018, WeChat, Alipay and Baidu had accumulated 200M, 170M and 150M daily active users of mini-programs, respectively. BATJXBPP will not be able to serve everyone's every financial need, but enterprising founders will figure out how to leverage them to fill in the gaps

More and more, China will export fintech to the rest of the world

A core part of our thesis since the start of Ribbit has been that the smartphone - and massive proliferation of data from mobile usage and commerce - would be the key to billions of unbanked people joining the formal financial system. This story has played out in China ahead of anywhere else. As the rest of the world catches up, we see it as likely that Chinese companies – armed with the talent, capital, and know-how we just described - will power much of the growth of fintech globally.

The parts of the world where we expect the most growth in the years to come (India, Southeast Asia, Latin America, Africa) have demographics and financial infrastructure far more akin to China than to the U.S. or Europe. The capabilities accumulated by Chinese companies – for example, utilizing alternative data for underwriting or fraud, or techniques for scaling mobile payment systems - are likely to prove more valuable than wisdom from traditional (less mobile-first, more banked) markets.

Chinese entrepreneurs are seizing the opportunity, utilizing Chinese capital and technical talent to build for markets abroad. Markets like Southeast Asia and Africa, with lots of unmet consumer demand but limited access to entrepreneurial capital or talent, are particularly ripe. In the last 18 months, we have met dozens of companies building engineering teams in China but serving markets like Indonesia or Nigeria.6 One-fifth of the top fintech apps and one-half of the top shopping apps in Indonesia are Chinese run or backed. And Chinese smartphone brands like Huawei, Xiaomi, Oppo, and Tecno are growing share across these markets; Tecno alone has 34% of the smartphone market in Africa.

And Chinese capital is already flowing freely into global fintech. Ant, Tencent, JD, and Xiaomi in particular have been investing in fintech abroad, providing cash and learnings to players ranging from PayTM (India) to Number26 (Europe) to Nubank (Brazil) to Uala (Argentina). In key regions like Southeast Asia, they are even more aggressive; for example, Tencent owns 30% of Garena, the largest game distributor, and Alibaba has invested in a number of wallets, including Dana Pay (Indonesia),

6 While geopolitical tensions may make it unlikely for Chinese entrepreneurs to enter the US fintech market, we do expect Chinese talent and know-how to impact the West. One celebrated company with a large presence in China is Zoom, which employs over 500 people - 30% of its team, and the majority of its engineers - in China. Zoom has delivered a world-class product with R&D costs at 10% of revenue, compared with 20-40% for peers such as Zendesk, Hubspot, and Atlassian.

Today's global financial services brands (e.g. Axa, Barclays, Experian) are headquartered in the U.S. or Europe, where modern financial systems developed earlier than the rest of the world. In the years ahead, we expect to see China shake off its image as an exporter of goods and become an exporter of cutting-edge services and technology, with fintech as a prime example. Visa, Mastercard, and Paypal became $100B+ companies by building the last generation of global fintech brands; in the next couple of decades, we expect Chinese founders will shape their fair share of the next generation.

One other area where we should not discount the potential influence of China on the global fintech landscape is in blockchain-based technologies. The Chinese government has been aggressive in regulating (decentralized) cryptoassets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, but at the same time active in supporting efforts to pilot permissioned blockchains across various domains. BATJ and other Chinese tech companies have been doing the same (we have spoken to many of them!). Many around the crypto world believe China is poised to launch the first true sovereign cryptocurrency, creating a blockchain-based platform designed to expand global use of RMB. We aren't convinced that it will happen soon, but we wouldn't rule it out either.

Request for Entrepreneurs, China Edition

If there is one thing we have learned since starting Ribbit, it is that entrepreneurs are the ones who show us the future. But since we all like to dream a bit, here's our stabs at where the wind will blow next in Chinese fintech. Consider this a shopping list!

Entrepreneurs inventing the future of Chinese asset management

China is home to the third largest internet company, the second largest oil company, the second largest bank, and the third largest mobile phone company in the world. But when it comes to asset management, China's largest asset manager - the grandly named China Asset Management Company - ranks #114 globally with $128B in AUM. Blackrock, with $5.3T in AUM, added over three times that much in AUM in 2018 alone. And, yet, U.S. households only have twice the investable wealth of Chinese households ($44T vs. $22T). What gives?

In many respects, the comparison is apples-to-oranges. Chinese financial intermediation is still highly underdeveloped, with bank loans (predominantly to SOEs) accounting for over 80% of financing, and 60% of consumer assets held in cash, deposits, or bank sponsored "wealth management products" (i.e. off-balance sheet assets making thinly-veiled use of bank's implicit sovereign guarantee). The bulk of remaining assets are invested in property or overseas. Chinese investors have found little reason to diversify; weighed down by listing requirements, speculative retail flows, and government intervention, Chinese equity markets have not proven a reliable generator of wealth. Even with many of the largest new companies in the world being Chinese (Tencent, Alibaba, JD, Baidu, Xiaomi), those companies are listing overseas. It is not surprising, then, that the ratio of mutual fund AUM to GDP in China (~14%) is less than one-fifth that of Australia (155%), the US (114%), and France (90%).

That said, China's asset management industry is modernizing. For example, while overall penetration is still low, mutual fund AUM has doubled to over $2T in the past five years. We see reasons to hope this trend accelerates, including government's public efforts to break the system of implicit guarantees, consumers being trained by fintech to shop beyond deposits, and regulatory encouragement of equity capital markets. And we see some signs of tangible progress. On the heels of new rules issued in 2018, the share of bank wealth management products that are principal-guaranteed has dropped by over one-third. Further, the number of NAV-based products – products that reinforce the real risk of value loss - has risen rapidly, growing over 5x in the last year.

When the dam does break on asset management in China, it should leave plenty of gaps for enterprising entrepreneurs to fill. We imagine this along a few different dimensions. First, we see room for founders to develop multi-billion dollar brands simply by quality investment products, akin to what companies like Wisdom Tree, Capital Group, or DFA have done outside of China. Given the opportunity to use technology to reach consumers directly, we may also see new kinds of specialization. For example, entrepreneurs might find success targeting specific demographic or psychographic groups; we have met founders in recent months with asset management products focused on quants, retirees, and sustainability, to name a few.

Second, we suspect the emergence of new asset classes - often underestimated or poorly understood by incumbents – will give birth to new asset managers (e.g. Blackstone and private equity, or Vanguard and index funds). So expect us to spend time with entrepreneurs building brands around sourcing assets in spaces like digital credit, liquid alternatives, and cryptoassets.

And thirdly, an expansion of asset management in China should also be a boon for entrepreneurs innovating around distribution, trading, reporting/analytics, and risk management. As the (original) forty-niners could tell you, it's good business to sell picks and shovels to people with a lot of money at stake. For example, capital markets-focused information providers in the U.S. and Europe account for over $150B in enterprise value (to say nothing of exchanges, market makers, trading platforms, etc.).

Entrepreneurs reimagining how to deliver advice

One of the defining trends of the global economy over the past few decades has been the enormous creation of wealth in China. It does not take a crystal ball to see that helping manage and protect this wealth is one of the biggest prizes in financial services today. The number of Chinese households with over $16K a year in disposable income is nearing 200M, an almost ten-fold increase in mass affluence in a decade. As we wrote to you (in a letter like this) about wealth management in 2017:

With over $20 trillion in personal investable assets, over 10% growth in every wealth management product category, and an overall savings rate of 50%, the sheer scale of the Chinese opportunity today dwarfs all other emerging markets... based on investable assets, China's wealth management opportunity looks about ten times larger than Brazil or India.

Against this wall of money, what is missing most is quality, unbiased advice to help consumers navigate increasing complex finances and markets. The emergent middle class is young (almost 70% between 30 and 45), technology-literate, and interested (by their own reports) in real estate, internet finance, and mutual funds, but still hold 3x as much of their wealth in deposit products and purchase less than a quarter as much insurance as their US counterparts. With the types and number of assets available in the Chinese market increasing - 5,800 mutual funds on offer in China today is 10x greater than a decade ago - they have more to sift through than ever. The Chinese who do invest more adventurously have a particularly bad record; retail investors account for 82% of Shanghai Stock Exchange volume, but less than 10% of the profits.

Though the opening is plain to see, the market is still characterized by relatively shallow, unsophisticated services. The wealth management players of the first wave of Chinese fintech focused on increasing access to simple products; businesses like Zhaocaibao (Ant Financial), Licaitong (Tencent), and scores of P2P companies attracted users with high-yielding fixed income assets, but have not expanded into more holistic advice, portfolio management or financial planning. Similarly, in insurance, early leaders like WeSure or Shuidi have shown success with distributing basic coverages (short-term health insurance, savings-based life insurance), but not yet in more complex products like critical illness or long-duration term life insurance.

The gap in the market for advice creates at least a couple of opportunities that we see in the coming years. The first is for entrepreneurs to build new direct wealth and insurance management services that leverage software to offer a broader selection of products and a high degree of personalization at virtually zero marginal cost. Beyond the clear consumer need, we are bullish on this idea for a few reasons: we see similar models gaining steam in the US and Europe; robust Chinese data access should allow for capturing a holistic picture of consumer's circumstances; and Chinese sales of life, health, and critical illness coverage are already growing rapidly. We suspect the most compelling direct-to-consumer approaches may find ways to challenge the status quo of Chinese financial brokerage without losing the human role in building trust. We can imagine, for example, a new breed of advisors working in front of four screens, empowered by smart leads, workflow systems, and personalized recommendations, interacting with 50 clients a day over WeChat - and using these efficiency advantages to offer a flat rate or AUM-based fee.

Second, we're also confident entrepreneurs will figure out how to put some of the same digital capabilities in the hands of Chinese financial advisors and insurance brokers. A number of venture-backed companies (e.g. EBroker, Meixin, NewBanker) are already working to build turnkey modern software platforms that deliver product, productivity tools and customers to advisors, a growing number of whom are leaving existing wealth management platforms like Noah and Hengtian. We have seen this pattern in several other markets, including the U.S., where companies like LPL Financial ($7B market cap) have built powerful, venture-scale franchises by enabling the growth of independent RIAs.

One last note on why we like advice in China: we see it as one area of fintech where artificial intelligence and machine learning can have great impact. With enough time and data, AI-based systems should learn to deliver sophisticated, tailored advice at mass scale, well beyond what even wealthy clients have access to today. Given the national interest in AI and the accessibility/abundance of

consumer data, we believe Chinese founders are well positioned to build pioneering technology that can dramatically expand the market for advice.

Entrepreneurs creating proprietary relationships with SMBs

Since the start of Ribbit, SMB financial software has been one of our favorite global themes. Historically, SMBs have been difficult to serve – workflow needs vary considerably by industry, business owners are strapped for cash and time, and churn tends to be high. But the advent of low-cost SaaS models and digital distribution has opened up the opportunity to serve even very small companies profitably. Further, financial SaaS as a category can generate real moats, addressing business needs that require highly specific, secure, and compliant workflows. In the U.S., multi-billion-dollar venture-backed financial SaaS companies like Square, Shopify, Gusto, Lightspeed, Carta, and Toast have demonstrated the power of the model. But in China – despite being home to over 30M businesses contributing over 60% of GDP – the market is still nascent, with only a few venture-backed winners focused on serving SMBs.

We believe financial services can play a central role in lighting a fire under the Chinese SMB SaaS market. A common historical perspective on SaaS business models in China has been that business owners are not accustomed to paying for software. Whether or not this stereotype about subscription models is (or remains) true may be a moot point, financial services likely offers a better way to grow and monetize. With the marginal cost of delivering business software dropping towards zero, a fintech-led approach - capturing customer's data and attention with software, and then making money with payments, lending, insurance, cash management, and more – should become a powerful business model for software entrepreneurs.

One thing we like about this category of businesses in China is that BATJ are only positioned to serve a portion of the market; there are many SMB verticals where they have neither a meaningful professional relationship with customers nor access to the right customer data for underwriting. In contrast, companies building horizontal financial software (ex. payroll, accounting, bookkeeping, or supply chain management) or vertical business management solutions (ex. software platforms for restaurants, gyms, or investment firms) should find themselves in a natural position to offer financial services that are highly customized and targeted within the right context to help business owners accomplish their goals.

A second thing we like is that, as in many other markets around the globe, there are strong regulatory tailwinds from initiatives designed to help SMBs modernize their business practices (a.k.a. pay their taxes). Over the past couple years, China has implemented a value-added tax regime as part of a broader reform to support the growth of a services economy and align more closely with international standards. Further, the government has enhanced tax oversight through the Golden Tax System Phase III initiative (China's vision for an integrated, digital tax system). These regulatory changes have increased requirements on SMBs around filing expenses, issuing invoices, accounting for inventories, submitting custom forms, and paying their bills – all use cases which require software-based solutions and which produce data and workflows relevant for providing financial products. For example, on the back of these trends, we have seen growing momentum for Chinese cloud-accounting platforms, as incumbents (e.g. Aisino, Kingdee, Yongyou) make efforts to digitize while newer, more modern platforms (e.g. YunZhangFang, HuiSuanZhang and DaZhangFang) gain steam.

At a time when financial infrastructure is becoming increasingly available over APIs, software entrepreneurs should be well positioned to capture value with highly personalized, contextually-relevant financial offers. We see the potential for a broader shift in how B2B financial services are organized. In a world where geography becomes less important – that is, where a cloud-based software platform knows more about you and your business than your local bank - that software platform can become the logical broker or provider for your financial needs. We believe that software entrepreneurs should be able to build specialized financial brands across a range of categories. And not all of these will present themselves as workflow-based SaaS products; the biggest winners of all may be B2B marketplaces that enable networks of commerce, perhaps utilizing a zero-take rate model but monetizing by offering payment solutions, credit terms, or insurance products utilizing data built within the network.

So if you hear about a company and think to yourself "that could be the Intuit, Xero, or ADP of China" – or better yet, "that could be a huge new B2B marketplace or network of XYZ-type businesses in China" – please think of your friends at Ribbit.

Entrepreneurs running fallen angels that outlast the storm

One fact that is easily overlooked during the Chinese fintech winter: China has produced more public fintech companies in the last 10 years than any other country. It is shortsighted to see the long-term potential in the market but forget that some of these players - down on their luck today, but still built with modern technology - may be best positioned to capture it.

The best of the public digital lenders, for one, may prove more enduring than today's market believes. These companies have some moat-building to do; they need to find more proprietary channels, deepen their differentiation in customer targeting and underwriting, and develop diverse capital markets strategies. But the top players have already lent billions of dollars and accumulated millions of customers, establishing young brands and track records with regulators, financial institutions, and investors. Additionally, tough times have led them to considerable market share gains. In Q1 2019, the top 20 P2P platforms originated 70% of industry loans, up from 44% a year earlier.

For the time being, the market is not buying the long-term bull case. Despite growing at 50%+ year-over-year, the most reputable fintech players are valued similarly to traditional financial institutions, at 5x P/E or 2.1x P/B on average. At the same time, companies like Lexin, PPDai, and ZhongAn are building customer bases in the tens or hundreds of millions, with line of sight to becoming substantial institutions. Though average revenue per customer is low for the fintechs, this shortcoming also reflects the opportunity to deepen client relationships over time.

While we are tracking these companies closely, we are not in investment mode yet: we continue to monitor the regulatory environment, are sharpening our opinion on which teams have the DNA to build for the long-term, and are debating who is best positioned to compete or cooperate with powerful tech companies and resurgent financial institutions. But at current valuation levels, it is not a stretch to believe that the right team can generate venture-type returns in the public markets in the years ahead.

As we touched on earlier in a brief description of Qudian, one possible outcome is that one or more of the digital lenders built in the past ten years as a consumer- and SMB-focused business evolves into a predominantly enterprise player. As Chinese banks work to catch up with tech savvy competitors like MYBank and WeBank, they may find that the most effective technology partners have battle hardened their systems by lending themselves. The upside to doing this well should be very large; consider the fact that the top four financial services software platforms in the U.S. generate over $30 billion a year in annual revenue. If one of China's fallen fintech angels is able to leverage its experience to help Chinese institutions market, originate, and service at scale with modern software, the outcome may make the fintech crash of 2018 look like a minor speedbump en route to becoming a dominant, critical piece of Chinese financial infrastructure.

Entrepreneurs building with an international state of mind

Historically, most U.S. investors we know who have looked at Chinese investments have talked about "investing in the Chinese market" while at the same time touting the global potential of their U.S. (or Israeli) portfolio companies. With the maturation of the Chinese technology ecosystem, this way of thinking about China has become outdated. Investing in Chinese companies may be one of the best ways to invest in the growth of fintech across the world.

As discussed earlier in this letter, one trend behind this is China's growing role as an exporter of capital, talent and technology, a role we expect to be pronounced in fintech. A separate but equally powerful trend is the increasingly global nature of Chinese consumption and commerce. As Chinese consumers/businesses spread across borders, fintech companies that serve them should as well.

Consider, for example, the growth in Chinese consumers traveling internationally. Today, Chinese tourists are the world's biggest spenders abroad, shelling out over $250B annually. Assuming a take rate of 3-6% on interchange, FX fees, credit, insurance, and other services implies a direct revenue pool for financial services providers of as much as $15B. Further, with Chinese consumers spending so much money, there is a substantial indirect opportunity to help international merchants enable Chinese payment methods and financial products. On the business front, cross-border ecommerce accounted for over $1.5T of transaction volume in 2018, growing at over 20%. For some perspective, this figure is over 3x the volume of all U.S. ecommerce ($518B) during the same period. Similarly, Chinese investors continue to look for ways to grow their exposure to international assets. Families from China have more money offshore - nearly $1T - than families from any other country. Despite China's efforts to keep more capital onshore (which has, for example, significantly reduced Chinese flows into US commercial real estate), Chinese individual investors purchased over $30B in U.S. residential property in 2018, more than any other foreign group for the sixth straight year.

From a bottom-up perspective, some of the most interesting Chinese fintech businesses we have spent time with over the past couple of years have been building on top of these trends. For example, we have seen substantial growth in payment processors handling complex cross-border flows (e.g. Airwallex, PingPong), merchant acquirers enabling cross-border spending (e.g. Citcon, Omnyway), and wealth platforms supporting offshore investments (e.g. Meixin, NewBanker, EBroker). Given the size of the market, the complexity of serving cross-border needs, and the advantages of nimbler fintech companies in pushing the envelope, we expect we will see more in the years to come.

Entrepreneurs leveraging channels and capabilities that are new or unique to China

Many of today's top fintech companies have found success by designing their product and distribution strategies with a mobile-first orientation. As mundane as that insight sounds, building for mobile (i.e. taking full advantage of the features of the phone, like incorporating natural gestures and utilizing location information) and distributing for mobile (e.g. reaching customers through phonebook-based

referral programs, utilizing new mobile channels like Instagram) has been a major differentiator for fintech companies who are not saddled by the outdated lessons and infrastructure of traditional offline or Internet-based financial services. In China, a mobile-first orientation has been a critical component of the success of companies like WeBank.

As we move onto the next generation of fintech in China, we suspect some of the most successful founders will build products natively on emergent platforms. They should have a helping hand; as covered already, large tech companies have been busy removing barriers (e.g. Ant/WeChat APIs, WeChat groups with integrated payments, Douyin e-commerce). Mini-programs are case in point, enabling a new level of customer ease (no need to download an app), data access (immediate credit, fraud, and payment authentication), and speed (deploy with a few lines of code). We can imagine a Chinese entrepreneur building a B2B finance app as a WeChat mini-program, enabling business owners to invoice customers, accept payments, offer complex credit terms, manage customer relationship data, and more - and launching a beta version of it in a weekend. The potential for moving quickly and iterating with these tools is unprecedented in fintech around the world today.

Other new media channels are promising as well. Douyin is one of the best examples we see today. Douyin is built with a fundamentally different architecture than traditional search or social media platforms - instead of typing in keywords or following friends, Douyin uses a purely algorithmic approach to find content that is interesting to the user. Already, we see entrepreneurs using this new format, making use of entertaining 15-second videos to educate customers on buying products like health insurance, with the quote and bind experience integrated deeply into the interface. Given that many newer modes of interaction (short-videos, chatbots, and smart assistants) actually allow for more complex communications, entrepreneurs may find ways to deliver digital products that have historically been impervious to more traditional, click-to-buy approaches on mobile.

As has been the case for mobile-first fintech apps, the most promising products will also leverage unique aspects of the Chinese technology stack to win in these channels. With more fluid privacy laws and more accessible data, they will employ AI/ML throughout their products, increasing levels of personalization (e.g. offering insurance packages designed for individuals' specific life circumstances). With the availability of programmable payments, they will embed logic into transactions, increasing automation and interoperability (e.g. enabling small businesses to build effortless CRMs, promotions, and loyalty schemes). Put simply, we will be keeping our eye out for founders who wow us with something we have never seen before; we suspect this will be both possible and necessary in China.

Entrepreneurs capitalizing on the digitization of Chinese incumbents

One thing that jumps out when you look at the top fintech companies in the U.S. vs. China is striking difference in types of businesses - and namely that China has few valuable B2B software businesses, while this accounts for the majority of the value in the US. China is short on modern SMB or enterprise platforms like Intuit, Workday, or Guidewire, as well as traditional financial technology businesses like Fiserv, FIS, and First Data.

There may be a variety of reasons for this, but one hypothesis is structural. While the US financial system has historically been deep and fragmented, with many small- and mid-sized financial institutions (creating a market for specialized financial software companies), China has been dominated by large, state-owned enterprises who have hired vendors and integrators to build their own internal systems. As a result, Chinese institutions operate with low levels of interoperability and less access to best-in-class technologies.

While the U.S. model for enterprise financial software certainly leaves plenty to be desired – we would be hard pressed to describe banks on FIS system's or insurance companies using Guidewire as setup to be nimble - the challenge in China is also greater; after all, tech giants have conditioned consumers to expect personalized and immediate financial services. This gap should create a range of opportunities for entrepreneurs willing to grapple with complex, institutional clients – CRM, analytics, underwriting, fraud, compliance, operational processing, to name a few. This trend is of course not unique to China. But the gap in need vs. capabilities may be the largest anywhere in the world.

It would be very unlike Ribbit to work with companies building core banking software and selling enterprise deals in multi-year sales cycles; in China, we would have little to offer to the best entrepreneurs doing this. But one reason why we will watch this category is that we suspect that in

China, like in other markets, that next wave of enterprise enablers may not look like the last. Rather, the most innovative solutions may come from companies built to serve fintechs first, evolving with time to fit the needs of larger, more complex institutions. The best of these may present themselves as payments or "banking-as-a-service" platforms (e.g. Stripe or Marqeta in payments, Plaid or Tink in data aggregation, or Cross River Bank or SynapseFi in bank products), eventually moving beyond serving entrepreneurs outside of financial institutions to serving entrepreneurial developers within them.

In Summary

There is an important part - perhaps the defining part - of the Chinese fintech ecosystem that is impossible to capture in a data-driven investment letter like this. When you meet entrepreneurs in China, you get a visceral feeling of the intensity of operating in an environment that allows you to reach hundreds of millions of users and billions of dollars of value (sometimes in months!) but where every day is a battle against massive information asymmetry, insider political/capital gamesmanship, and a competitive ethos best summarized as "I live, you die." Intuitively, you know that partnering with entrepreneurs in China requires a different way of thinking.

Similarly, when you consider the interaction between financial regulation and innovation in China, you are examining something volatile, a system that can shake an industry's foundations overnight. Any prescriptive analysis of what regulators will do misses how politicized fintech can be in China. We cannot say what Xi or other Chinese leaders feel in their hearts about fintech, but we can see the kinds of tightropes they are walking: real estate values that need to support leverage but also allow young people optimism about their futures; implicit guarantees that need to be broken but without people losing too much money in the process; small business owners that need access to capital but without flooding the market with bad or predatory credit. This balancing act creates a regulatory desire for control - of fund flows, incentives, and licenses. Intuitively, you know that managing risk in China requires a different way of thinking.

Different though it may be, if you aspire to invest in the most impactful fintech businesses of the coming decades, China is too important to ignore. Even with recent slowing, China is still growing 2.5x faster than the U.S., on a path to becoming the world's largest financial services market. On sheer size alone, odds are that many of the biggest fish in fintech – the ones that can grow to 10B+ or $100B+ brands - will be found in Chinese waters. And China has many of the world's entrepreneurs most capable of fostering these giants: founders with access to first-rate talent, capital, knowledge, and infrastructure, who have been part of building some of the world's top Internet and fintech companies and will keep dreaming bigger dreams. More and more, backing them is not just about investing in China, but about investing in fintech all over the world. With Chinese founders and capital spreading across borders, some of the most successful fintech companies in Indonesia or Nigeria or Brazil in the years ahead will be conducting fundraising, strategy, and partnership discussions in Beijing.

In spite of this potential, Chinese fintech is on sale right now. Valuations and deal dynamics are far more reasonable than any other time since we started Ribbit. Founders are investing in technology and differentiation, not growth for growth's sake. While hot markets have their charms, we know that bearish periods often produce the most impactful companies (e.g. Uber, Airbnb, Stripe, and Square, all launched within a few years of 2008). And though a common view is that the game has been won, a broader lens suggests we may just be starting. Every generation of tech has its goliaths that are considered unbeatable, like WeChatPay or Ant are today in Chinese fintech. But goliaths tend to fall into traps; they get locked into a business model or miss an important adjacency or technology wave. It may take a dramatic platform shift to see an opening for the next decabillion-dollar Chinese fintech company, but if history is any guide it is likely to appear sooner than we all expect.

So how do we approach a market that is so different but also so important, so entrepreneurially dynamic but also pitched towards greater centralization, party control, and incumbent empowerment? While our efforts in China, like everywhere, will start from the bottom-up (that is, we will pursue great entrepreneurs where we find them), you can expect us to follow a few broad principles.

First and foremost, who we partner with – the founders, co-investors, and strategic players – will play a critical role in our investment decisions. This is true in any market, but none so clearly as China. Great local founders and investors are always most attuned to local dynamics. When waters get choppy, as they inevitably will, we will need to rely on trusted relationships to keep steady. We will work to earn this kind of trust by being valuable partners ourselves – by providing exposure to global fintech leaders, ideas, and best practices, and by bringing opportunity along with capital (e.g. JVs with portfolio companies outside of China). As you know, none of this can be done overnight, which is why we already have been working with a few close partners in China for years. High-quality partners like Hillhouse Capital have been enormously helpful to us in understanding and accessing the market.

Second, we will invest where we see patterns that draw on our exposure to financial innovation around the world. We will look to back founders who are using new data to fundamentally reprice risk or employing disruptive models to offer something at 10x the efficiency or experience of existing solutions. But we will also focus on ways in which these innovations can be brought to market alongside Chinese tech and financial services institutions. This may go beyond sharing ownership and profit, to also helping these institutions transform their organizations (e.g. digitization for banks) and access broader financial services revenue pools (e.g. JVs with tech companies).

Third, expect us to think carefully about how our investments are aligned with China's broader goals. This means pursuing entrepreneurs building in areas where the government has stated interests: serving SMBs more effectively, growing protection-led insurance products, attracting foreign capital flows, deleveraging the economy, modernizing capital markets, and internationalizing the RMB, to name a few. It also means investing in entrepreneurs who are projecting Chinese power and capabilities abroad, supporting China's broader “one-belt-one-road” strategy and ambitions to export its fintech systems and capabilities abroad. And assuming that licenses will be hard to come by in the years ahead, it means investing more heavily in entrepreneurs who can build value without them. This position is getting easier to hold as institutions get better at partnering with fintech companies, but it's a departure from our usual pride in our comfort working in licensed environments.

Lastly, expect us to be cautious about the way that we structure our investments. One critical point has not received much attention in this letter: the biggest risk for us in China may not come from domestic factors but rather from rising geopolitical tensions. Looking past the daily trade war tweets, it has been challenging for Chinese investors to participate in regulated businesses in the US for some time (e.g. Ant Financial's failed attempt to acquire Moneygram). For the moment, China appears to be headed in the opposite direction, lowering barriers to foreign investment in the financial services industry. But this is a high stakes issue and subject to change. Investing in China, we run an unusually high risk of something happening where we cannot access funds or investments. This is not a reason to avoid the market altogether, but absolutely one that will makes us think hard about our approach to sizing and structuring.

Depending on the day, we can picture China as Ribbit's white whale, white elephant, or white knight. The truth, of course, is that we can't time the market or predict how or when the winds swirling around China - the rising strain in US-China relations, the political tensions on display in Hong Kong, the economic pressures of slowing growth – will settle. But we can think critically about the next wave of fintech entrepreneurship in China, and the people, technologies, and ideas that will power it. We
