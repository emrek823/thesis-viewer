# Why Integral

# Context

Healthcare data fragmentation is one the most detrimental problems in the industry. It’s detrimental because companies in the healthcare industry are bleeding billions due to a lack of customer understanding that is achieved only through data. This type of customer understanding is typically table stakes in less regulated industries such as ecommerce. Facebook can gather all relevant datasets in a number of hours; healthcare companies are lucky to do the same in a matter of weeks.

Data fragmentation is caused by lack of formatting standardisation across decades of data collection, staggered digitization efforts by the healthcare industry, and negative ramifications from inadequate policy. And it causes incomplete analysis, subpar health outcomes for patients, and billions in losses for companies. Specifically, life sciences companies are leaning into innovative methods such as machine learning to cut development costs and create dynamic outreach strategies to boost sales; the problem is that all of these use cases are enabled by COMPLIANT healthcare data; today’s process to make healthcare data compliant is consulting driven which means it’s heavily manual, takes months, costs too much, and lacks technology. This means any data driven strategy, whether innovative or necessary to improve the bottom line, is delayed by months and can’t create actionable improvements. Companies want to make data driven decisions now and measure results asap; the current compliance processes take too long. A major overarching tailwind is that data collection and abundance have exploded recently so there is an abundance of a variety of data available. All of the fragmented data silos that are growing massively need to be connected for analysis as quickly as possible. We do that.

# Short Term

Integral is the data enablement layer for healthcare. We do this through automation and collaboration tooling.

The healthcare industry has to be collaborative because no single entity has enough data due to US regulations. So company A must share data with company B and C, and so on. But companies need to discuss data schemas, hygiene, and make live edits, and more. Currently this is all done through emails, zoom calls, and screen sharing. This is not only inefficient, but also all of this info is generally necessary in the expert report so this represents a major gap in the current value chain.  There are no tools to make the collaboration and data sharing seamless. We have those tools built into our platform so when companies A, B, and C want to share and analyse data; they can collaborate and automate all in one place.

We automate the operations necessary to make healthcare data compliant, aka usable. And we do it in hours, not months. We free the imprisoned data by making sure patient privacy and data utility are equally respected. For example, you could block out all of your healthcare data to be compliant but you would get no analytic value, aka data utility. The alpha for life sciences companies is in the bespoke insights; those come from creative data analysis, which starts with highly valuable, privacy-safe datasets. Our privacy automations statistically ensure that datasets contain enough information to be of high value but that they are also sufficiently protected.

Tie together collaboration and automation and you have the data enablement layer for healthcare. We enable companies to work together to share data, use Integral’s privacy engine to produce usable datasets for a variety of use cases, and keep all your compliance paperwork in one place.

# The wedge

All life sciences companies have the same market segment: people. Their alpha is in the marginal amounts of analysis they can do to get the edge over each other to sell to people. The customer journey for buying a prescription drug involves a number of influential points such as insurance approval, provider recommendation, pharmacy fill rate, and more. The distance between seeing a provider about an illness and the point of purchase is plagued with potential landmines that will cause a lack of prescription purchase. Life Sciences companies can’t understand all of those landmines today. This is because no single entity owns all of the data on all points of the journey; they’re all individual data points owned by different organisations. However there is a fix. Today, life sciences companies are buying all the right data; but they can’t combine them until a consultant gives them a privacy certification that approves a dataset combination. A lifesciences company has to consider all of these different points involved in the journey almost as individual discrete battles to win. If they win all of the discrete battles they achieve victory: purchases of prescriptions. Data is the key to do that. Companies are buying the datasets on the various points in the journey today to piece together a complete picture so they can identify gaps in their understanding, painpoints for the user in their journey, and develop solutions to both. Prescription data, provider data,and  geographic/wearable/social/demographic data, are all data points that represent a point in the user journey.

## The Immediate Use Cases

We’re starting out by tackling “commercial” use cases. These are use cases that belong to the commercial departments of pharma companies such as those led by CMOs (Chief Marketing Officer), CDOs (Chief Data Officer). Non-exhaustive list of use cases are below.

challenge: targeted advertising requires bespoke datasets so ads budgets can be allocated to target the right types of populations but the bespoke datasets are hard to achieve because of privacy reasons. They’re even harder to achieve in a quick period such that quarterly business decisions can be made. Today, this results in poorly deployed ad budgets (pharma industry spends north of 5B on ads every year)

challenge: social determinants of health paired with healthcare data (aka Real World Evidence) is becoming number one data strategy for research and analysis (ex: pair someone’s location, job, and other non-health factors with health factors such as prescriptions, surgeries, etc) but companies have to wait on consultants to approve these novel linkages, if they’re approved.

challenge: clinical trial recruitment is extremely important because every patient that falls through costs time, money, and sets development back. So companies must optimise by targeting the exact type of profile for clinical trial recruitment and being targeted in a privacy safe way quickly is not possible.

Challenge: ML models output certain datasets or values in datasets by assessing large amounts of healthcare and non-healthcare data. However, the output and input datasets must be certified dynamically because the value of the ML model is to learn on the fly. So certifications must be done on the fly.

# Why Us

Integral will win because of its meticulous execution at every step: product, GTM, and master plan. On the product side, no one can touch my insights. No one did what I did at LiveRamp. I worked across product, BD, compliance, data, etc. I did all of this to shepard multibillion dollar life sciences and insurance companies through de-identification and compliance processes. The Integral software is architected to reflect this unique set of insights. So quite literally we are replacing a human that was at the center of millions of dollars worth of workflows. John built data ingestion systems for one of the largest data ingestion companies in the world. We’ve known each other for 6 years across 2 companies, 10+ side projects, and more.

# Long Term

By spreading like wildfire in the ecosystem and automating compliance we’re akin to laying down exit signs and building a highway. That highway will be used to facilitate data communication and deliver data where it needs to go. If you, as a life sciences company, want to send data to an analytics provider and you’re both using integral, then compliance is an after thought because we facilitate the transfer. If you want to receive data from a data provider for a learning model that will deliver targeted messaging to customers based on a certain set of conditions, and you’re both using Integral, compliance is an after thought because we will facilitate that transportation. To continue the analogy, that highway will then be followed by restaurants, gas stations, and other amenities. To break out of the analogy, this means complementary features such as a data exchange and analytics layer. If you’re bringing in your data to Integral, why not analyse data right there? Why not buy a new dataset right there? You do everything there because everything will be compliant.

We win by locking companies up using a data compliance product and using that automated compliance as a foundation to build a compliant analysis and data procurement platform aka the all-in-one healthcare data analysis platform.

# Raw Notes

## Collisions

Compliance collides with the need to be data driven for analysis, sharing, and ML. We marry data utility and compliance to safely enable companies to do whatever they want.
