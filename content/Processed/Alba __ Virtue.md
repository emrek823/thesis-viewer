### Kirupa’s Background & Alba Company Overview

- Engineer turned lawyer turned product developer
	- Master’s in engineering (software/electrical), neural networks background from 20 years ago
	- Intel paid for law school - philosophy: “break the rules but not the law” in highly regulated environments
	- Law firm for 4 years, exposed to pharma (IP is just as much the business as the drug itself)
	- Amazon as first lawyer for digital units, then Square with Jack Dorsey on Bitcoin regulatory issues
	- FinTech experience in highly regulated spaces
- Wife is addiction and child psychiatrist working with VA on osanpe for addiction using real world evidence
- Met advisor Ross Cuban (XYZ) who invested without knowing specific idea - helped mentally get over the hump
- Early this year scoped down different ideas between FinTech and pharma tech - pharmacovigilance emerged early in cycle

### Current Alba Team & Product Vision

- Team of 4 people - only Kirupa officially onboarded, others working but waiting for seed funding to transition
	- CTO, product person (wife is PV physician, building products for 2 years), founding engineer
	- Advisors on contracting basis for PV expertise
- Core problem: PV world is heavily manual with poor data quality
	- More than half of ICSRs rejected due to poor information quality
	- 17 days average from initial call/email to regulatory submission
	- 50-60% of cases require back and forth for missing information
- Solution approach: AI/RAG model using clinical trial data, real world evidence, Sentinel data
	- Intelligent questioning from first contact with doctors
	- Earlier signal detection in the process
	- Multi-language phone system demo available
	- Human-in-the-loop approach for medical reviewer oversight

### Market Opportunity & Customer Feedback

- Pilot partner working with 505(b)(1) and 505(b)(2) products plus generics
	- Cost reduction focus - even generic prednisone requires $30k/month literature monitoring
	- Hiring challenges - hard to find and train people for call centers
	- Recent pushback against offshore call centers (accent complaints from elderly patients)
- Two-sided market approach:
	- CRO/vendor play for cost efficiency
	- Direct to pharmaceutical companies as plug-and-play solution
- Argus monopoly opportunity - “shocking how much monopoly they have with very little innovation”
- Jazz Pharmaceuticals head of PV (advisor) excited about “Harvey plus Lovable” analogy for PV physicians
	- Signal detection should be continuous, not monthly/bi-monthly due to tool limitations
	- FDA regulatory responses (3-day turnaround) require massive team coordination currently

### Financing & Next Steps

- Pre-seed completed with Ross for mental transition from previous job
- Planning $4 million seed round - Ross ready to lead or co-lead
- Ross making warm introductions this week due to limited pharma experience
- Sentiment: “Haven’t met anyone so in the space and understand space and excited about it as you are”
