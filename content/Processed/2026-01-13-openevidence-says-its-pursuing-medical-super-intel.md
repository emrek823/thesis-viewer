OpenEvidence has rapidly become a household name among physicians, with a chatbot that answers their day-to-day clinical questions. Last year, it raised $200 million — twice — valuing the company at more than $6 billion. Its next [reported round](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/chatgpt-doctors-startup-doubles-valuation-12-billion-revenue-surges), yet to be confirmed, would double its valuation to $12 billion.

It doesn’t come as much of a surprise, then, that the four-year-old startup took its first step onto the stage this year at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference, where many of the health care industry’s most prominent players lay out their grand visions for investors.

Investors’ exuberance for OpenEvidence is emblematic of the AI froth that has taken over health care, and JPM, in the last [two](https://www.statnews.com/2024/01/17/jpm-2024-health-care-generative-ai-nvidia-amgen-recursion/) [years](https://www.statnews.com/2025/01/14/jpm-dispatches-nvidia-recursion-dexcom-health-tech/) — applying the technology, and in particular its generative variety, to everything from drug discovery to back office operations to patient care. AI-based startups Abridge and Hippocratic AI, along with OpenEvidence, have all closed multiple mega-rounds this year, noted Rock Health in its 2025 [digital health funding report](https://rockhealth.com/insights/2025-year-end-digital-health-funding-overview-a-tale-of-two-markets/).
