*   For field calls that are initiated within RightSite, this calculation starts when the RightSite Navigator accepts the call from the crew member in the field.
*   DialPad calls are not answered in RightSite application, therefore we have hard coded time to 10 seconds based on the historical averages. These times are reviewed regularly to ensure 10 seconds is appropriate.

_Note: The table is constructed from the stacked segments. The "Total (minutes)" column represents the sum of the visible segments, but the chart's main title gives a single overall average for all data shown, which is 19 minutes. The individual month bars' full height implies the total for that month, not a sum of all agencies in each month as some are likely not present for all months._
