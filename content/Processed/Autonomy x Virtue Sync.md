### Maxine Hiring Decision

- IT would seriously slow us down if we didn’t have her - critical for product velocity
- Currently: $180k annualized at $175/hr contractor rate
- Status: Team likes her, communicated interest, but need formal decision
- Challenge: She’s evaluating what she wants to do next, considering starting company eventually
- Timeline pressure: Need yes/no decision to maintain momentum with client deliverables

### Key Deadlines Driving Urgency

- October: NPC group meeting (20 practices) - product launch opportunity
- February: Neural Net Annual Summit (105 practices) - major rollout target
	- Christina Dent and David at Texas will push adoption
	- Much bigger than 3-4 practices if successful
- Current bottleneck: Need engineering capacity to meet these timelines

### Proposed Offer Structure

- Compensation: $200-225k (above current $180k annualized)
- Equity: 2% with standard 4-year vesting, 1-year cliff
- Title: Founding engineer (though she previously dismissed this as “bullshit title”)
- Role flexibility: Engineering focus but exposure to sales, BD, forward-deployed work
- Alternative: Let her create own title if important to her

### Maxine’s Motivations & Concerns

- Wants experience to eventually start own company
- Seeking mix of engineering + business/product exposure
- No longer actively considering starting company immediately
- Needs compelling offer and clear growth path
- Located in New York, well-connected in engineering scene

### Backup Engineering Search

- Starting search process regardless of Maxine decision
- Need 1-3 engineers depending on quality
- Targeting: Non-healthcare backgrounds preferred (healthcare tech often not truly tech-focused)
- Sources: Network outreach, recruiting firms, AI sourcing tools
- Companies to target: Palantir spinouts, Bridge (leadership issues), SmartDX (post-acquisition churn expected)

### Next Steps

- Natalie/Rooshil: Have numbers conversation with Maxine tomorrow
- Emre/Sean: Reach out to Maxine post-discussion to provide investor perspective on opportunity
- Formal offer with 7-10 day expiration if initial conversation goes well
- Continue engineering search pipeline regardless of outcome
- Potential founder introductions (Jake suggested) if helpful for Maxine’s decision
