Summary
The Tegus Client engaged in conversations with experts from Total Medical Supply and Tennr, focusing on the automation solutions implemented by Total Medical Supply and the services provided by Tennr. Total Medical Supply experienced growth by shifting focus to continuous glucose monitoring devices and automated back-end workflows to manage expansion. Tennr's platform offers workers for tasks like fax wrangling and referral intake, with discussions on qualifications, pricing, and areas for improvement, highlighting the positive impact on efficiency and patient servicing.

Expert Details
Executive Vice President at Total Medical Supply Inc, a customer of Tennr.

Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer at Total Medical Supply Inc. The expert manages 175 employees and is responsible for overseeing the day-to-day operations of the business including, but not limited to, implementing new technology, optimizing workflows, IT development, overseeing compliance, optimizing supply chain management, logistics, etc.

The expert can speak to product management, revenue analysis, data analysis, sales, patient care, medical devices, and healthcare.

Client
Hi. Thank you for taking the time to speak with me. For some context, I am doing some research on the different AI tools to automate healthcare operations. Maybe to start off, it would be helpful if you can share more about your background, your current role, and then also just more context on Total Medical Supply and what you all do.

Expert
Yeah. I've been with Total Medical Supply for almost five years now. It'll be five years in June. I started in the field as outside sales. I did that for quite a while, about a year, and then they moved me back into the corporate education in my hometown. I've worked up the ladder through seven different departments. I took over as our EVP of operations, so managing about 140, 150 internal team members. Recently, they promoted me to CFO as well, so all of our day-to-day financials analysis and forecasting, as well as maintaining the operational efficiency of the business.

A little bit on Total Medical Supply, it has been under the current ownership since 2013 and it was founded in 2006. From 2013 to 2019, the primary focus was state Medicare supplies and catheters. It was a smaller entity, sub-$5 million in revenue. Our CEO and COO found continuous glucose monitors in 2019, and that's when the rocket ship took off, if you will, and it became our main product. Now, we're servicing about 45,000 continuous glucose monitoring patients across the country in 48 states. We're now just under 200 employees, total, doing a little bit north of nine figures in revenue annually.

Client
Got it. You actually sell the continuous glucose monitoring device?

Expert
Yeah. We are a middleman. As a DME company, we service Medicare and Medicaid patients. We bill their insurance and obtain payment, but we are not the manufacturer of these products. We purchase these from Abbott Diabetes and Dexcom. Those are the manufacturers. We purchase them at a contracted or agreed upon price, and then we bill the Medicare or Medicaid, depending on the patient's payer. We ship it directly to their doorstep, and then we obtain payment from their payer, from their insurer.

Client
Got it. Are these patients being referred to you by their providers? How do you typically get your clients?

Expert
Yep. We have 18 sales reps across the country, so outside sales reps. They're calling on different physicians, primarily endocrinologists and internal medicine physicians, and they're calling on them for those referring providers to then send us in that order for a new patient, and then we continue to service them.

Client
Got it. Do you have a continuous relationship with these patients, or do you just sell them the device and then that is it? Is there an actual relationship there?

Expert
Yes. There is a resupply program. Based off the Medicare laws, you can only supply up to three months of product at one given time, and they are disposable products. These CGMs only last for 10, 14, or 15 days, depending on the model. We do have constant communication with our patients as well as our physicians we work with, to get updated information as well as continue to provide services to these patients. We're getting over 2,000 new patients a month, whereas we service about 30,000 to 40,000 resupply patients a month.

Client
Got it. These new patients are coming, like you said, from the internal medicine or endocrinologist office. What was the process or what was the status quo of how you managed that volume before adopting any technology?

Expert
Yes. We were big on just hiring employees, so we had a ton of employees that would receive the fax, review the documentation, make sure that it all passes compliance protocols with the insurance payers, review documents, call the patient, and then ultimately, ship it out the door. It was a very manual process. Of our 180 employees, about 20 in the field, and the rest are back-end operational team members. There's a lot of legwork going in to get these patients their product.

Client
Yeah. What was the impetus or what led you to looking at some of these automation solutions? Were you actively looking for something to automate it? Did you come across it somewhere in a conference? I'm just curious how it started.

Expert
It was the decision to begin looking into automated solutions. We're in a smaller town. We're not Dallas or in New York or anything with a massive job pool, so we got to this critical mass, growth of which we're the largest employer in our town. We noticed this continued growth and we were like, "Okay. We need to implement some solutions to alleviate the need to continue hiring at this very quick rate that we were on and subsidize that need for more and more employees." That began the hunt process. The CEO and myself had that conversation at the very beginning of 2024, right around the new year, and that's when we began the hunt.

We reviewed four different software companies. Synthpop was one. We reviewed CompliantRx and then

Darby. Those were the main ones we were looking at. Ironically, the stars aligned. We ended up at a trade show at the beginning of March, and that's where we happened to meet the Tennr team. They had a booth at this trade show, and that's where we met them. Again, stars aligned. We got to talking with them, reviewed their product, and they ultimately became the one we decided to go with.

To hit on that, the reason we decided on them is, a lot of these software solutions or AI models that are out there, we have found that they're very cookie cutter in the sense of whatever they have or whatever they built, they want you to build your operational workflow around their solution. Tennr felt very much like the putty to fill in the cracks like, "Hey, here's some areas that we're struggling in. Here's some areas we can improve," and they were very much like, "Oh, yeah. We can assist there. We can build on top of that need." That was exactly what we're looking for.

We wanted that customized solution. It almost felt like they were our personal engineers or personal AI gurus, which was a feeling and a sensation we really enjoyed. On top of that, financially, it made a ton of sense as well. Those were the two factors we looked at. Obviously, pricing is very important in any healthcare space, very low margins in DME, and their customized solution. That was the ultimate decision to go with Tennr. We then signed once it went through legal, all the documentation stuff. We started in April of 2024, so it's been one year.

Client
Got it. In your evaluation, were you specifically looking to automate? What part of your operations were the key priority areas that you were looking to automate? Was it an open mind, where you were just looking at these different tools and seeing what each of them could do? What was the criteria on that front?

Expert
We were open-minded with the solutions, but because we work in the DME space, a lot of 65-plus-year-old patients, we really didn't want to bring AI into the conversational piece with our patients. We enjoy having a team member on the phone with them. We looked at different areas that were, call it, all back-end flows, no conversational needed, just repetitive monotonous workflows. Those were some of the areas we first looked at. It was actually the first two areas that we implemented with Tennr. Our decision-making was we didn't want a robot, if you will, calling our patients.

Client
Got it. You said you signed with Tennr in April 2024. When did you go live with them? How long was that process?

Expert
Yeah. It was within about a month. The first month, they had to understand our business, we had to make sure they had all the proper credentials to connect within our EMR platform. We did it in a phased rollout. We currently have four workers at Tennr. Each workflow or each AI model they have we utilize, we call them workers. We have four active workers, and we took it in a phased approach. We didn't try to launch all four right away. We started with one at a time and used it as building blocks. We had the first one live within about a month.

Client
Got it. What was the first one?

Expert
The first one, we call it fax wrangling or documentation wrangling. On average, we're receiving around 1,500 faxes every single working day. With those faxes, they might go to eight different departments, whether it is a billing inquiry, if it's a brand-new patient, so maybe it's a new documentation, it might be follow-up documentation that has to go to a document retrieval team, prior authorization, correspondence, whatever it may be.

Instead of having team members read through each fax just to filter that to the appropriate team, we use

Tennr's AI model. It reads through all of our faxes as they come in, and it says, "Yep. This goes to billing," or "This goes to an executive team," whomever it needs to go to. That document wrangling or fax wrangling was first.

Client
Got it. That was just, basically, figuring out who the fax should be, who needs to be the end person to receive it. Did that include actually going through it and putting the information into a system? Was that first use case just focused on where should each one go, which department should be directed to?

Expert
Yeah. That one was really just focused on where it should go. It connects with our fax portal, and it would put the faxes in the appropriate bucket. Every day, if somebody's in the billing team, they might see, over the course of the day, 100 faxes come in. Tennr was the one that routed those from our generic fax bucket over to them. That first step did not have an integration with our EMR, but step two does.

Client
Got it. The second worker was taking, once it's routed to the right place, going through that document and putting the information in whatever system instead of someone having to do it manually?

Expert
Yes. That would be referral intake. All of our patients that don't have any patient account within our EMR system, Tennr is now putting that patient into the EMR. It's reviewing the documentation, and then it's keying 33 different fields that we tell it to, from patient name, date of birth, all of the different fields, shipping address. That was worker two.

Client
Got it. What are the others?

Expert
The next one was qualifications. In the DME space, they're called LCDs or local coverage determinations. All of these different insurance payers that provide us our revenue have different criteria in order for a patient to be covered by an item. If it's a diabetic item, they might have to be insulin-dependent or whatever it may be, has specific diagnosis codes, and so on and so forth.

We trained Tennr to review those medical records that we obtained for the patients and let us know if it qualifies or if they do not qualify for service. That one was a much more tedious, involved workflow. That one was actually about a four-month implementation just due to the amount of intricate details that Tennr had to develop.

Client
Got it. What's the last one? I know you said there's four.

Expert
The last one is insurance eligibility benefits. For each of our patients, every time they get a new resupply of product, we have to reverify that their insurance hasn't changed and they haven't gone from a Medicare plan to something else that maybe we cannot service. Tennr actually goes in it reviews all of that eligibility and it tells us, making sure that they're still eligible for product, so we can then ship it out.

Client
Got it. Are you working on any others today?

Expert
Those are the main four. We're at the point now we're really just optimizing and making little tweaks and

adjustments to each of those workers.

Client
Got it. Are there any that you would like to see? Are there any ones that you're thinking about that you want to work on them with in the future?

Expert
I would love to see more communications with the referring providers. If we get a fax that comes in and maybe it's not completed with everything that we need, would love for it to be able to say, "Okay. We're missing this," and then perform an outreach to the referring provider, letting them know what we're needing in addition to it. I think that would be a great next step, and we're working on it.

Client
Got it. Right now, the way it works is, once the fax gets routed to the right department, Tennr starts pulling out all the key fields, filling them into the EMR. If there's something missing, would it just notify you or whoever is using the platform that there's missing information, and then that person would have to manually reach out to the referring provider and get the remaining info? What does that workflow look like today?

Expert
Yes. Currently, if there is bad documentation or whatever it may be, our team will then reach out. They would say, "Okay. This patient, we need updated this or that or the other." They're performing that outreach manually now. You're correct.

Client
Got it. Are there anything else that you can think of that you'd be excited to see from them?

Expert
I think another thing is prior authorization requests. Some of these insurance payers, you have to obtain prior authorization before you can bill the insurance provider for services for those patients. It's a very manual process now of filling out documents and faxing it in or uploading it in their portal. I would love to see Tennr have the capability of connecting to a portal, filling out the prior authorization request based off the information we have in our EMR system, and then submitting that prior auth. I think that'd be amazing.

Client
Just to understand, right now, when you set the qualifications, is that not the same thing? They're looking at the patient's coverage and understanding whether or not they would qualify for the device. How is that different from the prior authorization?

Expert
The qualifications have to be done for every single patient. You have to go in and qualify. A subset of those patients, it will let us know, "Yes, these benefits are active. However, you need to obtain a prior auth to provide services." In those use cases, those go to a different team member, and they submit the prior auth and do all of the things needed. It's an extension of that eligibility worker, is the right way to think about it. It's the last phase of that eligibility worker.

Client
Got it. The worker three, the qualifications product, is for new patients who you just want to know if they qualify based on their coverage. I'm not sure what the reasons are, but maybe you can tell me, some of these patients need another step after that, which is just getting a prior authorization from the insurance provider. The worker four, which is the insurance eligibility, is focused on just returning patients. I'm trying to understand the difference between worker three and four as well.

**Text:**

yeah. Fax wrangling, the very first worker touches all faxes. Referral intake, worker number two, only works on brand-new patients to us. Worker three, the qualifications, that works on the front end and on the back end, so any patients. All of our patients have to get updated medical records every six months. Whenever it's a brand-new patient, we have to make sure they meet qualifications, but then in six months, whenever they've received all of these resupply orders every month, and at six months, we have to get new medical records, we still have to make sure those new medical records meet qualifications to continue service. The qualifications works both.

Now, the insurance eligibility, that one we use on the front end and the back end. We always have to verify that their insurance is eligible. In that eligibility check step, sometimes they will let you know that they need a prior authorization. If they do need a prior authorization, that is when we then have a prior auth team fill out the form, contact, obtain that prior auth. For the 75% of the time that we do not need it, it then goes through and we provide product and ship and so on.

Client
Got it. I'm still not sure I understand the difference between the qualification and eligibility. Isn't it if someone is qualified, doesn't that mean they're eligible?

Expert
No. Us, as a DME supplier, you have to get contracts with insurance payers. Somebody can be eligible but and somebody can qualify, but not be eligible. To explain further, if somebody has red, white, and blue Medicare and if I run their insurance eligibility and they say, "Yes, you are eligible. We will pay this much for this service," that means they're eligible. Now, from a qualification standpoint, if they are trying to get a CGM, a continuous glucose monitor, but they're not even diabetic, they would not qualify for that product even though they're insurance.

The inverse, I might not have a specific contract with Blue Cross Blue Shield of California, I cannot bill that insurance. Therefore, their insurance is not eligible. Even though they might meet all of the qualifications, they might be diabetic and inject insulin 10 times a day and all of the things, their insurance is not eligible with me as the DME supplier because I cannot bill their insurance. Does that help?

Client
Got it. For the prior authorization ones, even the ones who are eligible, for whatever reason, some patients still need to get a prior authorization from their insurance.

Expert
You're spot on.

Client
Got it. Was the biggest differentiation for you between Tennr and these other ones just the fact that they are customizable and they're building for your personal workflows? What exactly is the key difference?

Expert
You're saying what is the key difference between Tennr and.

Client
No. I mean between Tennr and the other companies that you evaluated, the other solutions you mentioned, like Synthpop and CompliantRx or whatever. I know you mentioned the key things that stood out to you were Tennr's customization versus just being a cookie-cutter solution. Was there anything else about Tennr that stood out, from a product perspective or whatever, that really made it unique compared to the other ones?

Expert
Synthpop and CompliantRx really only focused in that qualifications sector, telling them if they meet the LCD or not. Darby had more offerings, but it was still very limited. Whenever we were talking to those other

companies, they're like, "hey, these are the real specific areas we work in," whereas Tennr, I was like, "Hey I need to be able to sort faxes and I need to be able to input data into our EMR and I need to review stuff."

It was very much so they were willing to learn and adapt and do all different steps. If we wouldn't have gone with Tennr, say we would have went with CompliantRx, we would have had CompliantRx for the qualifications, and then for the data entry, the document or referral intake, we would have had to use another AI solution. Tennr was the all-in-one solution for us.

Client
Got it. How much are you currently spending on Tennr on an annual basis?

Expert
We just signed a two-year agreement for over $200,000 annual.

Client
How does that work exactly? Is the pricing per worker? Is it by volume of referrals? How does the pricing work?

Expert
It's per worker. It's per how many documents or how many actions that Tennr does. Every time it does an insurance eligibility for every patient it reviews to make sure they're eligible, that's one action. For every time it keys a patient into our EMR, that's an eligibility. It's per that volume, and it's an agreed-upon, forecasted amount. We sit down together and say, "This is how many we think we're going to do per day, per month, per year," and then we agreed upon a fixed rate based off that calculation. If it's slightly above, it's prorated after to make sure that they get all of the amounts.

Client
Got it. When you started with them with the first worker, how much were you spending?

Expert
When we first started, it was over $130,000 annual. It's an annual agreement.

Client
Okay. Basically, even with one worker, it was that amount? I would have expected it to be less. I don't know. You said your volume is 2,500 a day, so maybe you have higher.

Expert
Whenever we first started, when we signed the agreement, we knew that they were going to build four workers for us. It was paid upon the four workers, and you pay it monthly. It's a monthly payment, but we knew we were going to build four workers in the first year, so that's where we were charged the sum.

Client
Got it. How do you foresee that spend growing? The amount you are paying, do you see that doubling, tripling? How much do you think you would eventually be spending with Tennr?

Expert
It's all dependent on growth. Over the next two years, I don't foresee it being north of $500,000 annual.

Client
Got it. How do you view your return on investment with them?

The biggest way we see it is looking at the amount of employees we've been able to reallocate. Prior to Tennr, our operational team, if you did it on a per-person basis, they were able to service about 300 patients each per month. That was just extrapolated out based off the volume that we service. Now, with Tennr, a year later, we're able to service around 390 patients per employee. We have found, if we didn't have Tennr, we would need to hire roughly 14 more employees. If you take our average payroll from an operational standpoint X 14, it's very much so a net positive ROI for us.

Client
What's the average payroll for you?

Expert
Over $50,000.

Client
You didn't fire anyone that was doing this already, but it's more just about they're now able to focus on more high-impact and useful, manual, tedious tasks, and you won't need to hire more people as you grow. You're just looking at how much you're able to save from not having to hire these 14, whatever, how many people.

Expert
Absolutely spot on.

Client
Got it. If you had to say on a scale of one-10, how likely you are to recommend Tennr, what would you say?

Expert
A nine. I think there's been a massive impact for us and our company.

Client
Why is that not a 10? What would make it a 10?

Expert
I don't like to give 10 just because I feel like there's always room for improvement. There's still more areas that we can grow and make more and more efficient. They've been a blast to work with and they provided extreme value for us.

Client
Got it. What are the areas that you would improve? Is there anything about their current offering besides what you mentioned, which are areas where you'd like to see them expand to, but areas where you think they could be doing better with today's product?

Expert
I feel like sometimes the model can still get confused on certain things. We send so many documents through the platform, we expected it to quickly learn and recognize the format. The format of these documents a lot of times are the same. We thought that it would be able to recognize those quickly and become near perfect. That hasn't happened yet. It's still extremely accurate, but it definitely think they could improve their model. Once it sees something that it's seen numerous times, it should learn and be like, "Oh, I made this mistake last time. Let me not do that again."

Client
Got it. You still have someone, like a human in the loop, reviewing it? After all that automation, there's still someone reviewing it?

Expert
That's correct.

Client
Got it. Today, it sounds like the referral and intake process was a huge part of where a lot of the manual data entry stuff was being done. Today, if you were to describe in the back office, what are still super, manual processes or workflows? I know you mentioned prior authorization is another one. Where would you describe as the biggest pain point in terms of that today?

Expert
Where's our current existing pain point?

Client
Yeah. Of where it's still very manual.

Expert
I would say the biggest manual flow right now we're still fighting is our confirmation process. Once you ship a product to a patient, you have to go in and it's called confirming an order. It, essentially, is us taking that order and billing the insurance. It's very manual, but it's so important because you don't want to get a bunch of denials. That's the most tedious, but it's also one that would be the hardest to automate because you do not want to increase your denials and not get paid from your insurance companies.

Client
What part of the process does that come in?

Expert
That would be after we provide the shipment and then we're ready to bill the insurance. That's the last step of the process.

Client
Got it. What exactly are you confirming?

Expert
In our system, we have what's called a sales order. It's the order that we're providing the patient with their product. It has the tracking number, patient information, item they received, all of the information, their insurance. We have to go through and do like 20 different checkpoints to make sure that it meets all the standards that it needs to in order for us to bill the insurance. By confirming it, that Is us billing the insurance for the product to obtain payment.

Client
Got it. Is there anything I haven't asked you about Tennr, about this market in general that you think would be helpful for me to know as I continue spending more time in this space?

Expert
I really think we hit through all the big ones and important ones. A lot of good questions.

Client
Great. Maybe one more question for me, actually. Most of the Tennr customers I've been speaking with are home care providers or specialty providers. I haven't really spoken with other DME companies. Do you view this as a great profile for Tennr, or is there something unique about you all that makes you a good customer for them?
