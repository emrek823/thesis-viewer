Health insurers that sell Medicare Advantage plans are going to get about $30 billion more in taxpayer money next year.

President Trump’s Medicare agency finalized a rule Monday that would raise benchmark payment rates to privatized Medicare plans [by 5.1% for 2026](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/2026-medicare-advantage-and-part-d-rate-announcement). That was higher than the Biden administration’s [proposed payment increase of 2.2%](https://www.statnews.com/2025/01/10/cms-medicare-advantage-rate-hike-2026-unitedhealth-humana-aetna/) — and well above what Wall Street investors had expected.

The increase is greater because Medicare’s actuaries used more updated federal data on the spending patterns of people who are enrolled in the traditional Medicare program, which is used to calculate how much Medicare Advantage plans should be paid to cover their members.
