Solstice is the commercialization engine for life sciences. We help biopharma companies effectively market their therapeutics by designing beautiful, personalized content for HCPs, Patients, and Payors and effectively delivering this content to maximize therapeutic reach

What We Do:

Solstice is a digital life sciences marketing agency. We help biopharma companies create compliant content for their drugs 100x faster and more effectively than their existing content partners.

We are a full-stack replacement for everything a content agency does - we create content, evaluate it for compliance, annotate and fact-check as well as submit into a client’s digital asset management system (usually Veeva). You can think of us as Real Chemistry but faster, more efficient, and with even better margins.

While we currently focus purely on the execution of content based on ideas that marketers at these biopharma companies have, we will eventually move towards delivering that content through appropriate channels, measuring performance and then adjusting content to improve performance.

Status Quo/Trends

Marketing in life sciences is very different than in other industries due to heavy regulatory scrutiny which causes extensive review cycles for content. Something like an email can go through 3 review cycles, and as a result, can take upwards of 3 months to get from idea to deployment

Long timelines to create content means that it is impossible to customize content for different audiences. In consumer, you can receive hyper personalized and targeted content based on your preferences. Why doesn’t a physician receive ads based on other medicines they prescribe, how much they value NCCN guidelines or how the most recent formulary change impacts them? Biopharma companies have all of this data sitting on hand but content production is the bottleneck. If an email takes 3 months to produce, it is impossible to create hundreds of variations targeted at specific audiences. In a world, where content creation can happen within minutes - this now becomes a possibility.

Currently most biopharma companies use marketing agencies to create their content. Agencies are incredibly expensive because they hire PharmDs, PHDs, etc to create content and have long, unnecessary processes that add overhead without impacting quality

Marketers would like to create content themselves, but existing tools are not purpose built for life sciences and so custom configurations and effort required to do this is too big of a lift. They would rather just bite  the bullet and pay an agency.

Larger biopharma companies are trying to build their own in-house content factories but are struggling to get to production-ready content. Building technology is not their strong suit.

Solstice allows biopharma marketers to take control of their content and be their own agencies. We provide them a platform to go from idea to compliant, production ready content within minutes instead of months.

– Why is now an important time for biopharma companies to move off agencies — why do they need to specific move off agencies NOW

— Tie AI deeper into this picture

Dove-tail bigger, faster, better with a model that the incumbent cannot reproduce which is as a function of the product

There’s no real way RC recreate their business

Educate with lower level detail why RC business model is failing in real time

Biopharma needs to give personalized content because doctors are sick of the same content

Are we going to do everything that RC does

What is necessary from a Solstice Human-in-the-loop perspective. Is that same HIL required in the future?

Economics of the TAM

How big can Sanofi get?  (Can we do everything RC does and recreate all of them?)

Example Content

Workflow

Where we see this headed:

Life sciences marketing is a $40B industry. Top marketing agencies like Real Chemistry rake in >$600M ARR to make marketing, medical, and market access content for their biopharma clients. They charge really high rates, as much as $50k for a 10 page slide deck. AI makes content creation way easier and many biopharma companies are already exploring leveraging tech to make content themselves instead of through agencies. Thus far they have focused on simple content like social media posts made with ChatGPT, Adobe Fireflies, etc. This “simple content” is not a space we will play in because it is crowded and it's impossible for us to differentiate. However, making complicated medical content is really difficult because it needs to be accurate, brand specific, integrate into existing workflows and software, and follow regulatory requirements. This is the gap Solstice will fill. In other words, Solstice synthesizes dense scientific content and turns them into clear, personalized messages for HCPs and patients.

Just as Canva gives anyone the ability to be a designer and Cursor gives anyone the ability to design software - we’d like to give biopharma marketers the ability to create their own content themselves without relying on external agencies. The immediate product allows them to execute on their own visions. Eventually, Solstice will help marketers figure out what the best pieces of content to create are based on the performance of existing pieces, claims/prescription data and net-changes in external market dynamics (new competitors entering, formulary changes, LOEs approaching)

Current Traction:

Pharma:

Signed and Live: Phathom Pharmaceuticals ($120k initial ACV), Ipsen ($180k initial ACV)

Signed and will onboard this month: Sanofi ($100k initial ACV), Incyte ($19k initial pilot)

Going through procurement/legal: Takeda Oncology Business Unit (~$500k ACV), Nuvation Bio ($300k),  AstraZeneca/Alexion (>$200k+),

Will convert this quarter: CorMedix, Scilex Pharmaceuticals, UCB, Teva

Entire Pipeline (38 Companies) linked here

Goal with Fundraise:

Get to $10M ARR.

Assuming average ACV for $500k, that’s 20 MSAs with biopharma companies
