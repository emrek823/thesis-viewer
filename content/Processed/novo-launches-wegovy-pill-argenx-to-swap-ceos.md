Today, a brief rundown of news from Novo Nordisk and Argenx, as well as updates from Sanofi, Johnson & Johnson and Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical that you may have missed.

Novo Nordisk on Monday officially launched in the U.S. the pill version of its popular weight loss drug Wegovy. Negotiations with the Trump administration led Novo to price a starter dose at $149 per month for some Medicare beneficiaries and those willing to pay cash. The drug’s website shows that the $149 price will apply to the 1.5 milligram and 4 milligram doses until April 15, after which the higher of the two doses will cost $199. Monthly supplies of a 9 milligram and 25 milligram dose, meanwhile, are priced at $299. People with commercial insurance could pay as little as $25 per month out of pocket, Novo said.

Dutch biotech Argenx will swap CEOs, announcing Monday that leader Tim Van Hauwermeiren will become board chair in May 2026 as part of a planned leadership transition. Once the change is effective, current COO Karen Massey will succeed Van Hauwermeiren and take over what’s in recent years become one of the industry’s most valuable companies thanks to the fast-selling autoimmune drug Vyvgart. Despite the pending CEO switch, Argenx “is in a position of strength” with that drug on track for more than $4 billion in 2025 revenue, “sustainable profitability and a strong balance sheet,” wrote Stifel analyst Alex Thompson.

A dual-targeting antibody drug from Johnson & Johnson fell short in a mid-stage study in moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. On Dec. 26, J&J said that, upon an interim data check, the therapy, JNJ-95475939, didn’t meet the company’s “high bar” for efficacy and the trial was stopped early. J&J inherited the drug when it paid $1.25 billion to acquire a spinout of Numab Therapeutics, claiming at the time that the treatment had the potential to provide “distinctive benefits” versus existing atopic dermatitis treatments like Dupixent and Rinvoq.
