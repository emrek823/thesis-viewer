# 1. DEFINITIONS AND INTERPRETATION
1.1 The definitions and interpretation are set out in Schedule 1 (“Definitions”) to the Agreement while "Miscellaneous" clause includes interpretation rules. Where a Schedule is incorporated into this Agreement, the definitions and interpretations set out in such Schedule will apply in addition.

1.2 This Agreement is made up of the General Terms, the Schedules (including any Additional Clause), and any and all SOWs made under them. A reference to Additional Clauses is only applicable to the extent that such relevant Additional Clauses are included in Schedule 3 to this Agreement.

1.3 In this Agreement, cross-references are constructed by indicating the title of the relevant clause (which substitutes its entire numbering) and, after a full stop, adding the relevant sub-clause number of that clause, e.g. "Term.2" clause.

2.2 Once a SOW is signed by an authorised representative of both Parties or their Affiliate, it will be binding as between the parties to the SOW. Each SOW will be deemed to incorporate the General Terms and the Schedules (including any Additional Clauses) and will constitute a separate contract entered into between the relevant parties to that SOW.

2.3 Each SOW will continue until the earlier of:

2.5 Supplier is not granted any exclusivity or minimum purchase or volume commitment by AZ or any AZ Affiliate. AZ or its Affiliates may procure all or some of the Services or Deliverables from any third party or perform them by itself, and there is no obligation on AZ or any AZ Affiliate to enter into a SOW.

# 3. TERM
3.1 The term of this Agreement (including any extension rights) will lapse on December 31, 2027 ("Term").

# 5. ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

   5.1.3 a follow up to and/or additional follow-up information relating to an Adverse Event or Special Situation which may otherwise have an effect on an AZ product;

Supplier will notify AZ, within 1 (one) Business Day of becoming aware of all appropriate information in accordance with AZ Policies including, but not limited to, any relevant CRF pages, Special Situation reporting forms, and Clinical Study Medical Device / Device Constituent reporting forms (hereinafter called a “Safety Report").

5.3 If a Safety Report occurs outside normal business hours, for instance during a weekend or public holiday, and does not come to the attention of Supplier immediately, the date of awareness of the Safety Report (day zero) will be defined as the date on which the Safety Report is received by Supplier (regardless of the time of day) and not the date when Supplier first views/accesses the Safety Report.

5.4 Supplier will ensure that it retains and preserves any and all data, information, documentation and records relating to a Safety Report.

5.5 Supplier will:
   5.5.1 cooperate with AZ (or any delegated CRO or other Regulatory Authorities), provide all additional information required in relation to the Safety Report, and implement the corrective actions required by AZ (or any delegated CRO or other Regulatory Authorities) promptly and within all communicated timescales;

5.6 If applicable, Supplier will follow any requirements provided by AZ in relation to product risk management requirements.

5.7 Supplier will ensure that all Safety Reports received by Supplier have been communicated to AZ within 1 (one) Business Day via a reconciliation and/or confirmation process.

Should an alternate method be required for a specific project conducted under this Agreement then it must be detailed in the SOW for that project.

Once a month (within 7 (seven) calendar days of month's end), Supplier will provide a listing of Adverse Events and other reportable safety information received and reported to AZ to enable validation of receipt to be performed. Where discrepancies are identified, each Party agrees to inform the other Party and take necessary actions to resolve discrepancies and prevent recurrence.

7.12 No payment made by or on behalf of AZ will constitute acceptance or approval by AZ that Supplier has complied with this Agreement.

7.13 Supplier's invoices for any payments or transfers of value made to physicians, nurses, pharmacists, scientists, teaching hospitals or others ("Healthcare Professionals" or “HCP”) for which AZ may have legal reporting or disclosure obligations under Applicable Laws (“HCP Payments”) will identify each individual payment or fee by stating the relevant HCP's name, DEA/AMA number (if any), place of practice and other information requested by AZ. Promptly on AZ's request, Supplier will provide AZ with all other information in respect of any HCP Payments made by Supplier on AZ's behalf and cooperate with AZ to ensure AZ is able to comply with its reporting and disclosure obligations under Applicable Laws in respect of such HCP Payments.

10

On request, Supplier will provide AZ with a written certification from an authorised representative of Supplier confirming that all third-party materials, if any, included in any Deliverables include all necessary licences and rights for AZ and its Affiliates' perpetual and ongoing use of such third-party materials without additional charge.
