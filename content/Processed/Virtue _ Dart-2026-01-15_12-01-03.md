### Hiring and Team Expansion

- Major lesson from last six months: everything was founder dependent
	- Extremely frustrating not being able to focus on larger strategic areas
	- Changed up a lot of things in last 6 weeks to make team more independent
- Three key roles being recruited:
- End of year projection: 15-18 people total
	- Engineering: 2-3 additional engineers under head of engineering
	- Success: 4-6 delivery people under head of success
	- Sales: 4 people total across hospital and post-acute

### Product Development and Technical Infrastructure

- Context graph development paying off significantly
	- Ditched fine tuning and training (waste of time, not necessary)
	- Focus on context graphs, workflows, and real-time data collection
- Three core technical components:
- Recent model improvements (Opus 5.2) enable long-running tasks
	- Previously required deterministic engineering to stitch steps together
	- Now models can plan and orchestrate 30-minute tasks independently
	- Saves engineering resources, enables more diverse task handling

### Go-to-Market Strategy and Customer Insights

- Operational glue exists in both post-acute and health systems
	- Same stakeholders: quality, care coordination teams
	- Sitting between business operations and clinical teams
- Hospital sales approach mirrors post-acute success:
	- 50-80% same language and positioning
	- 100% shared technical infrastructure (Epic, Snowflake, security requirements)
	- Similar scale: thousands of patients daily
- Two main value propositions:
- Target health systems: those with multiple quality leadership layers OR no quality department
	- Multi-layer systems benefit from 90% time savings (currently waiting on BI)
	- Systems without quality departments often have VBC contracts (good fit)

### Competitive Positioning and Market Dynamics

- Differentiation from Palantir, Vizier, TextQL:
	- Those competitors connect to systems but miss post-decision human context
	- Dart captures human-in-loop feedback and agent interaction data
	- Focus on harness that allows models to improve through context accumulation
- Cost and deployment advantages:
	- Previous pitch: $1M, 6 months implementation
	- Current capability: $150K, 3 weeks implementation with simulation in 2 days
	- Enables land-and-expand vs long consulting projects
- St. Luke’s triaging use case example: previously impossible, now on whiteboard for quick deployment

### Business Metrics and Financial Performance

- Deployment speed improvements: 50% faster implementations
- Processing volume: 100+ thousand reviews per week
- Inference costs down significantly, but reinvesting savings into better customer outcomes
- Gross margins stable despite lower model costs - using savings to send more data for higher quality
- Jackson (delivery hire from 2-3 months ago) performing well, easier analysis after month 3
