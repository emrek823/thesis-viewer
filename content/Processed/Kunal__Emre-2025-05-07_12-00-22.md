### Product Concept Feedback

- Company Sourcing Feature
	- Primary concern about data sources for early-stage companies
	- LinkedIn Sales Navigator identified as main sourcing tool currently
	- Feedback: Integration with Sales Nav would be valuable for pre-seed/seed companies
	- Current manual process involves creating new organizations and copying LinkedIn profiles

### Portfolio Management & Network Features

- Portfolio Monitoring
	- Current process: Quarterly LP reporting across 24 companies
	- Key metrics tracked: Revenue, burn, runway, product updates, go-to-market updates, quarterly goals
	- Preference for tracking changes rather than ratings/scoring
	- Value in summarizing monthly updates and board deck content
- Network Access Feature
	- Strong interest in LinkedIn network integration within Affinity
	- Use cases:
		- Business development
		- Sourcing
		- Portfolio company introductions
		- Team-wide connection sharing

### Comparable Analysis & Analytics

- Comparable Company Analysis
	- Identified as highest priority feature
	- Key factors for comparables:
		- Market/space alignment
		- Stage (seed, series A, series B)
		- Geographic considerations
	- Current manual process for tracking pass/fail decisions
	- Need for external market research integration
	- Suggested addition: Automated deep research queries before calls

#### Action Items

- Kunal to consider integration with Sales Navigator as priority
- Explore automated deep research integration for market analysis
- Consider portfolio company access to network features
