# FIRESIDE CHAT KEY TAKEAWAYS
## Healthcare and Pharma Advertising: How using the right data can supercharge your campaigns

## 1 UTILIZE UNIQUE DATA TO AMPLIFY CAMPAIGNS
At Digilant, we ensure we work with partners who have a thorough data strategy and are compliant with all standard advertising regulations. Lasso works with Purple Labs and IQVIA (formerly known as DMD Connects) to guarantee the data is HIPAA compliant, granular to reach specific HCPs, and frequently refreshed.

IQVIA is fully opted-in physicians and NP/PA prescriber data, allowing Digilant to reach over 90% of active physicians with email addresses and other matching identifiers updated in real-time.

Purple Lab leverages privacy-compliant patient data based on medical claims, insured status, and other demographic characteristics.

## 2 CONTINUE TO USE FUTURE-PROOF DATA AND SOLUTIONS
As we quickly approach the deprecation of third-party cookies, now is the time to start testing and learning cookieless strategies to see what future-proof solutions work best for your brand. The data Lasso can leverage is not reliant on cookies.

Some solutions to reach HCPs include:
*   NPI Target List
*   HCP by Specialty
*   Diagnosis / ICD-10 targeting

Some solutions to reach consumers include:
*   targeting by condition
*   competitor RX conquesting
*   custom modelled audiences

## 3 LEVERAGE REPORTING THAT TELLS A STORY FOR MARKETERS
Marketers expect standard reporting from every digital campaign to understand how their campaigns perform. But our partnership with Lasso takes reporting to the next level. We can provide Script Lift reporting, Script monitoring, OTC measurement, 1:1 Physician Level Reporting, and other valuable reports like Pharmacy Level Insights and Competitive Data. This enables advertisers to understand how their brand stacks up against competitors and insights into how campaigns perform beyond standard metrics.

Detailed analytics are analyzed directly in Lasso's platform. Hence, they're able to shrink the time between reporting from months to weeks, allowing Digilant to provide optimization options faster.

## 4 USE AN OMNICHANNEL APPROACH TO REACH HCPS AND CONSUMERS
To drive better business outcomes, the ultimate goal for healthcare marketers, advertisers must learn to reach their audience across multiple channels and touchpoints. Partners like Lasso make it easier to achieve this desired outcome, connecting with HCPs and consumers through their data-driven solutions, such as:

Trigger Targeting: Take omnichannel story-telling to the next level with sequential messaging. Lasso Triggers allows you to deliver behavior-triggered sequential messaging across all channels, including programmatic, email, and social. With Triggers, you can drive audience engagement through deterministic-based, custom sequencing logic.
