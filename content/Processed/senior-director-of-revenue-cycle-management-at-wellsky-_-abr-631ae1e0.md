## Summary
The head of RCM at WellSky, a company with equity partnerships with large health systems, successfully implemented ambient listening solutions in a medical group of 700+ physicians to improve clinical documentation and coding accuracy. Despite initial resistance, physicians embraced the technology for its ease of use and historical information capabilities. Ambient was chosen over other AI transcribing tools for its compatibility with athenahealth and positive pilot results at Stanford Hospital. The implementation has resulted in time savings, increased reimbursements, and a high ROI, with plans to scale it within the company. The expert is also involved in AI automation for mid-cycle processes with other health systems.

## Expert Details
Senior Director of Revenue Cycle Management at Wellskya, a customer of Abridge. The expert is responsible for leading the Acute RCM practice at Wellsky, composed of 16 acute hospitals (Tenet, Stanford, Sutter etc) that are managing their revenue end to end.

Senior Director of Revenue Cycle Management at Wellsky. The expert is responsible for leading the Acute RCM practice at Wellsky, composed of 16 acute hospitals (Tenet, Stanford, Sutter etc) that are managing their revenue end to end. This constitutes about 700 million in net revenue and 200 additional physicians spread across the country and a number of inpatient rehab hospitals.

The expert has spent their entire 25-year career in RCM management, heavily focused on the Acute and Physician side.

**Q:** Have you implemented ambient listening in your hospital system in the past 2 years? Were you directly involved with the implementation?
**A:** Yes, all Epic hospitals and medical groups. One of the key decision maker as it impacts CD and Coding.

**Q:** Have you evaluated/used Abridge specifically in your health system?
**A:** Yes and Deepscribe

## Client
Thanks for taking the call. I'm researching ai-powered medical scribes. Thanks for taking the call. I'm researching Maybe for background, can you remind me what your day job entails and what the size of the health system you work at is?

## Expert
I'm the head of RCM in my current role. My net patient revenue, NPR, is over $3 billion across many end markets. I have 15 acute hospitals that I manage in RCM. Nine of those are on Epic, the Epic platform, and six of them are on Oracle Cerner. Also along with those hospitals, I have a number of medical groups. The largest one is 700+ physicians. We have NPs, PAs and locum tenants and stuff. They're in athenahealth.

That's where ambient is today with athenahealth. I also have a lot of smaller medical groups.

## Client
Who do you work for? Do you work for a health system?

## Expert
Yes, it's very complicated. My company is called WellSky and we have three verticals. The first one is, we have equity partnerships with many large health systems in the country and standalone hospitals. Those hospitals and health systems are listed on our website.

## Client
What do you mean by you have equity partnerships?

## Expert
We're owners, actually. Owners with some of these.

## Client
Okay. You own hospitals, and then how many? You said 15.

## Expert
We have 15 right now with various partnerships.

## Client
Okay. Are you partners or do you own them?

## Expert
They're partners. It's a very complicated relationship. Sutter Health is one of them in California.

## Client
I'm still a little confused. Do you work for Sutter Health? Do they work for you? Are you the owner? Are you a holding company?

## Expert
No, we are actually partial owners. We have equity in these health systems. There are many more partnerships that we have that I don't manage the RCM for. Just currently, I have 15 hospitals and a bunch of medical groups that I manage the RCMs. We have other partnership, equity partnership, where the native health system manage their own RCM.

## Client
Okay. You don't manage the RCM for all of these hospitals.

## Expert
The 15 that I have, yes.

## Client
Okay. How many providers in total do you manage RCM for?

## Expert
On the physician side, my largest medical group is about 700+ physicians. We have other smaller medical groups like a ModMed in clinicals. I would say another 200. I would say roughly about 1,000 physicians that I have, the RCM that falls under me.

## Client
Okay. That includes the multispecialty clinics as well.

## Expert
Yes, there's the largest multispecialty, 700 physicians.

## Client
Okay. How have you come across the ambient listening solutions? Does it fall under RCM?

## Expert
It's yes and no. Ambient is a joint partnership with my chief medical officer and my operational directors. It has tremendous impact on clinical documentation, coding, and reimbursements. I'm one of the key decision-makers.

## Client
Okay. For all of these locations at once, do you go one by one? Do they make decisions all at the same time or is it centralized?

## Expert
No. Right now, ambient is only at our largest medical group. The 700+ medical groups that I have. That's where we have ambient. They've been with us about 18 months now.

## Client
You mean Abridge?

## Expert
We look at Abridge, we look at DeepScribe, and Nuance.

## Client
Can we go back a little bit? I was asking about ambient listening solutions in general, not Ambience, the company. These AI products are called ambient listening, note taking, transcribing, however you want to call them. In how many hospitals under your purview have you implemented any of those?

## Expert
Just my medical group of 700 physicians.

## Client
Okay. Why did you decide to look at these solutions?

## Expert
There was a need. We had tremendous gap. For this medical group, we were having a lot of clinical denials for medical necessity and coding-related denials. We have PwC, PricewaterhouseCoopers came in and did an assessment of our entire RCM front, mid back, the whole nine yards. They highlighted weaknesses in our clinical documentation and opportunities. About two+ years ago, this was done.

We have done internal reengineering initially with our case management team at this medical group to see if there's something that we can attack and proactively work on using athenahealth. Athenahealth has some similar technology like ambient. That didn't go too well. We continue to see pre and post-payment rise in clinical denials. That's when we started our RFP process about two years ago. We looked at a number of listening tools. There are various criteria.

## Client
Can you connect the denials to the medical notes for me? Why is having a transcribing tool, why would that decrease the number of denials?

## Expert
What happens is, many times the clinicians and physicians are not completely documenting what truly happened to the patient. What they're taking care of the patient for, like the HCCs and MCCs and not care. The complexity and the criminal abilities of the patients that are carefully documented. When that happens, as you know, we drop. Our coding engine is Nym, company called Nym that we use for this group.

Nym will produce a CPT code and we bill. The payers will come back and say, "Wait a minute, we haven't given you an authorization for this level of service." They will down code or reimbursements. They will request medical documentation. That causes delay in cash flow. It takes months sometimes for us to appeal and things like that. Essentially, it's a charge capture issue. It's not capturing the intensity of the patient care or lock off.

## Client
Understood. What companies did you evaluate to improve this? Did you also look at these tools because the physicians were pushing for it, or was it really truly an RCM driver?

## Expert
It's a great question. As a physician resist this.

## Client
I've heard it's because the physicians wanted to save administrative time.

## Expert
Yes, eventually they did. When we started this whole talk about ambient, as I said, we had a similar technology with athenahealth. What happened was, that didn't go too well. When we talk about bringing in a better technology like ambient, there was a little bit of a resistance from physician leaders. They were like, "Here we go again, more work, more stuff for us to learn," and things like that. They got over it. Now, today, I can tell you, they are so happy with it. All they have to do is fix the notes. The thing about ambient listening, I'm sure you probably heard this from your other calls, it produces historical information based on similar patient characteristics.

If a patient is coming in for abdominal pain and the conversation is recorded, there is, the documentation that the technology produces, it mimics similar patient characteristics and makes it really, really easy. It is highlighting what the physicians are saying. As a matter of fact, I've seen it in action. Today, when we first started this whole initiative with ambient and we first started our primary care physician, which is the largest subspecialty that we have, we have over 300 positions there. That was a tremendous success.

We started rolling out as orthopedics and things like that. Initially, there was a little bit of hesitation by our physician leaders. We had to do a lot of convincing. My COO, myself, and our clinical denial was over 10% with this medical group. The NPR there is over $400 million a year.

## Client
Before we go to those metrics, can we talk about the evaluation process? You decided you wanted to use a transcribing tool. Which providers did you decide to evaluate and which one did you pick and why?

## Expert
We look at ambient, we look at DeepScribe, another company called DeepScribe. Athenahealth, as I said, also had their own scribe that we were using. We look at Abridge as well. We looked at a number of things. First of all, we look at the product. Is it truly going to give us what we want, what we're seeking for? We look at their modules, we look how it works. Ease of use and things like that. By the way, my CIO also was part of these conversations. We look at the product and our needs. One big criteria was, do they have experience with athenahealth? A lot of these guys have experience with Epic and Cerner.

## Client
The seven-physician health system was on athena, not Epic?

## Expert
Athena, yes. Seven hundred positions.

## Client
On athenahealth?

## Expert
Yes.

## Client
That's very unusual.

## Expert
Yeah, we have automatic groups that are Epic. We still do have athenahealth there.

## Client
What is that hospital? Which brand is it operating under?

## Expert
It's on our website. Stanford is one of them.

## Client
Same as athena?

## Expert
An American group side. We also have a partnership with Cleveland Clinic. They're on their own Epic platform.

## Client
Specifically, which hospital is this group of 700 physicians that you started with?

## Expert
This is with Stanford.

## Client
Okay. They needed to integrate with athena. Did you do a pilot with multiple or not?

## Expert
Yes, we did a pilot. We first started with a group of, I think it was about 10 PCP, primary care physicians. We did it for the entire primary care physician group for about 300 and that was also a pilot for about three, four months. That went very well. We didn't have to pay anything and things like that.

## Client
Which ones did you do a pilot with?

## Expert
The primary care physicians group.

## Client
Which providers?

## Expert
Ambient.

## Client
You just did a pilot with ambient?

## Expert
That's it. We evaluate all the options for various reasons. Do they have experience with the current EHR? We look at the products, we look at the footprints and things like that with the various specialties. I would look at the pricing and stuff like that. We decided to go with ambient.

## Client
Why did you decide to go with ambient? Especially compared to Abridge, what do you think ambient had that was superior to Abridge?

## Expert
The group felt like it was easier to use. It has all the critical workflow. I remember the example that they give us about how they're capturing HCCs and MCCs, ambient versus Abridge, for instance. It was very, very cloud-based, very easy to use. The navigation of these platforms is a huge comparison with our medical team. It was easier to customize too because we asked questions about flexibility in customizing certain workflow. For instance, oncology workflow or cancer center workflow is different from OB/GYN, for instance.

We felt that it was easier to use, easier to make changes, customize, very cloud-based. Obviously, in all of these initiatives, we have our IT team there as well, some engineers and they felt that ambient understood the specs, the athenahealth specs for the project. Ambient versus Abridge and even DeepScribe, when we remember the conversation, they were pretty impressive too.

Looking at the dashboards and reporting, we felt that ambient was a much better choice. The presentations were fantastic. They had some great presenters, people with a lot of clinical background. We felt that ambient also had good staffing, clinical expertise in the room. As I said, the pricing was also competitive with other guys.

## Client
Okay. When did you roll it out?

## Expert
Ambient, the piloting was about three to four months. About 18 months ago, we started with the piloting and then after about a year, really, we went live with them at this point in time.

## Client
Okay. You rolled it out with, you started, you said with 300. How many actually use it today?

## Expert
Today, we have close to 500 physicians using ambient. A couple of specialties we're still working on.

## Client
Got it. You have 300 using it. They're all primary care?

## Expert
Yes. We have about 500 using it today.

## Client
Okay. Did you roll it out to specialty care?

## Expert
Yes. We have our orthopedic group, OB/GYN. Oncology was a big one for us. We have infectious disease on there. We have hepatology. We have our nephrology practice on there as well. The surgery department is not on there yet. That's pretty large. We have also a dental practice that it's not on there and a couple of other small. We're getting there slowly.

## Client
Got it. In total with specialty using it, is how many?

## Expert
About 500 physicians today.

## Client
Okay. How would you say it's going?

## Expert
It's going pretty well. There has been some hiccup. I'm sure you know how the tool works. It makes recommendations with E/M coding based on the documentation and things like that. There were instances where the guidelines and stuff that they provide, the physician leaders sometimes don't agree totally with the recommendation. I would say we are 95% there confidence level. The big thing the physicians love is the time.

I don't want to go over all of this because I'm sure your research really discovered all of this, is a time saving thing. They don't have to type while they're seeing the patients and things like that. It just records everything. Show it in the template, and then most of the time the nurses will go in there and review and make edits. Very easy. Spending more time with the patient and things like that. We have seen in the one year we got over $4 million pickup in additional reimbursements. One-time pickup, the first year. It's a one-time pickup of revenue that we had missed.

## Client
That was material for that group.

## Expert
Huge. The first year, we probably pay ambient about, anywhere between $200,000-$600,000. Eventually there were some implementation costs and things like that. The ROI was tremendous with them. That was a one-time pickup. I think going forward, obviously we've done all these projections and stuff. I think steering committee. I think going forward on an annual basis, I have a feeling that we're probably going to pick up $1+ million a year in reimbursements because of better clinical documentation, coding, less denials and things like that.

## Client
Okay. If you had to rate it from 1-10, how would you rate it, the solution? One being the lowest.

## Expert
I would give them a nine. We plan to scale them by the way. My company, WellSky also has many HR platform in the post-acute space. How Epic is. We also have five or six electronic health records in home health, hospice infusion, long-term care, inpatient rehab, hospital, SNFs. We are scaling ambient today. It's integrated in our home health EHR, which has about 20,000 clients. Just imagine that. Just to give you an example, how ambient is good, how it's been scaled.

## Client
Okay. Just so I understand again, what is your relationship with Stanford? Do they buy software from you or consulting? You certainly don't own the Stanford Medical Group.

## Expert
No. For a long standing relationship, our investors, they have relationship with Stanford. Basically, I can't comment on that. That's beyond me, about how the whole finances.

## Client
Yeah, I'm just trying to understand why you picked the transcribing platform for Stanford.

## Expert
We manage the RCM.

## Client
Okay.

## Expert
From my side, we work in partnership with their team of people. It's their CIO, their chief clinical officer and the whole management team over there. I have a key stake in the decision-making process because I am managing their revenue cycle management. It would be like, "What do you think?"

## Client
Okay. Maybe one last question then. From ambient, are you buying just the ambient listening product or are you also buying their coding automation product?

## Expert
The E/M coding assistant automation, yes. We have a different company called Nym that we use for procedure coding and surgery coding and things like that.

## Client
From ambient, what are you buying?

## Expert
Scribing, the coding assistant.

## Client
Okay. You are using both ambient and Nym for coding assistance.

## Expert
Yes, Nym is more for procedures.

## Client
Okay. Are there any other? You're just responsible for RCM. You're not responsible for AI for clinical workflows.

## Expert
RCM. There are other relationships that we have with many other health systems. I am part of AI automation in the mid-cycle. For instance, company, like with Optum, Waystar, Acuity. Those are. initiatives. I'm working with other health system and clients in automating the mid-cycle.

## Client
Well, thank you again for your time today. This was very helpful. Bye.
