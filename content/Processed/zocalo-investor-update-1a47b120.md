## HIGHLIGHTS:

**Hiring** – We recently onboarded two key hires to our team:
*   On 26 SEP, we welcomed Norma Bostarr as our first Director of Clinical Operations. Most recently, she served as Director of Growth Operations and Social Impact, leading Carbon Health's public partnership initiatives to ensure Californians had equitable access to COVID tests and vaccines. She directed a care team of ~750, who provided 1.1M COVID tests and 1.5M COVID vaccines across California.
*   On 11 OCT, we welcomed Sarah Lopez, MD, MBA as our first Chief Medical Officer. Sarah attended medical school at the University of California, Irvine and business school at UCI's Paul Merage School of Business. She was part of UCI's first Program In Medical Education for the Latino Community (PRIME-LC) cohort, a program focused on training highly qualified doctors who are culturally competent and dedicated to serving the diverse population of Southern California. She is currently practicing emergency medicine, regularly taking care of patients in the ER and sits on various boards for local non-profits. She will be working half-time with Zócalo Health through the end of the year and will convert to full-time on 01 JAN 2023.

**Hispanic Heritage Month Goals** – For HHM, we had 2 key goals: 1) Release funding PR and 2) launch our D2C product in CA and TX.
*   On 19 SEP, we announced our funding through this [press release](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://prn.to/3CHy5hR&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1666453986259885&usg=AOvVaw0X691N4Tj-r-mG5FmQ651M).

*   On 05 OCT, we launched services in Texas (without a press release announcement)
    *   We intended to launch our D2C services at the same time but ran into a major delay due to an unplanned account review that was initiated by Stripe (see lowlights for details).
    *   We saw our first patient on 07 OCT.
*   On 11 OCT, we announced the launch of our services in Texas & California along with our first membership plan through this [press release](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://prn.to/3T6o0J4&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1666453986261545&usg=AOvVaw2g7D-hJq284Qn-Gj8vJ4B-).

    *   Our Plans & Pricing page can be found [here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.zocalo.health/plans-pricing&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1666453986262799&usg=AOvVaw0iXFvJ614K-B8xU0oM0d2t). We intend to launch a family plan and per encounter pricing options in Q4.
    *   Our first paid customer signed up for our service on 12 OCT.
*   On a positive note, we have seen a consistent increase of traffic across our website (6 weeks ago we averaged <100 users/week vs ~1,000 users/week this week). We will be leveraging our agency in Mexico (Industria Social) to help us optimize our website to measure traffic quality and improve conversions.

## LOWLIGHTS

**Stripe Delay** – On 05 OCT, we intended to launch our D2C product offering, allowing prospective customers to select an individual membership and checkout (via Stripe). After we switched over to production, our Stripe account was flagged for review because we are a "telehealth/telemedicine" service. This review was unplanned and took exactly one week to complete. This delayed our planned press release by 6 days.

**Patient Volume** - Patient volume in September remained flat. We had an internal goal of serving 100 patients and while we managed to recruit 129 patients. Most of these were engaged through the first two months of our public beta. Due to trouble with Stripe we lost a week of time that would have been directed at early marketing efforts to capitalize on our PR engagement. We did post our first [Sr. Manager of Product Marketing](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3282298715/&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1666453986263597&usg=AOvVaw1931y4Lp1x9LpW3t08Tj7j) on LinkedIn earlier this week. The remainder of Q4 will be focused on gathering the appropriate resources to ensure we have a proper D2C funnel built.

Please listen and share with your networks. This one is HUGE!
*   **ASK:** Like & Share please ([LinkedIn](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/posts/zocalo-health_hispanicheritagemonth-health-latinx-activity-6987113170068875264-bM1F?utm_source%3Dshare%26utm_medium%3Dmember_desktop&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1666453986264254&usg=AOvVaw3Qd_j6jKz_01m_L4l1eT9v))

Last week we completed the 2022 AWS Health Equity Accelerator. The program comes to an official close next month when we will present at HLTH in Las Vegas. Zócalo Health will have a booth inside of the larger AWS booth and we'll be doing a demo onstage on 14 NOV (morning).
*   **ASK:** If we haven't met in person and you plan on attending, please let us know so we can schedule time to meet. We would also appreciate any introductions to any health plan contacts in CA, TX, or WA.

v.1 of our Zócalo Health native iOS app has been approved by the Apple Store. We are scheduled to make this public next week after final internal review.
*   **ASK:** If you are in Texas or California, we'd like for you to try the service. Let us know if you can help.

*(Screenshots of Zócalo Health iOS app showing "How can we help?" screen, "Schedule Appointment" screen, and "Chat with care team" screen)*

In October we launched a community outreach series titled " Cafecito, Cumbia & Salud Mental" which is designed to gather community members, organizations, and providers to discuss and remove stigma around mental health. We recognize that mental health continues to be an issue that plagues our community and in the early weeks of delivering care we have seen firsthand how mental health is impacting overall health. We kicked off this series in San Antonio TX at Cafe Azteca where 4 organizations and 80 community members attended. In addition to coffee, pan dulce, music and community resources, the attendees connected with each other and had the opportunity to meet the Zócalo Health team to learn more about Zócalo Health's primary care and navigation services. The success and feedback we received from this event has given us a playbook to repeat in other communities in 2023 as we continue to grow brand awareness, build trust with community organizations and sign up attendees as Zócalo Health members
*   **ASK:** We are booking out events in other cities now and looking for connections to coffee shop owners and/or community partners that could benefit from this series. Target cities are San Antonio, Houston, Dallas, San Diego, Los Angeles, and Oakland. See [photos here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://photos.app.goo.gl/kXy78pG5K9664M9L7&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1666453986264956&usg=AOvVaw31z_N4c2m82o_w940r52mU).

**Advisor Leads:** We have had several conversations with Kat McDavitt (former Collective Health) and Tom Validivia, MD (former Bright Health) and they are interested in becoming advisors. We like their deep experience and contacts in the payer space.
*   **ASK:** Do you know these individuals? If so, do you mind hopping on a call with us for a quick 10 min call?

We have received some heavy inbound from strategic partners including health plans and federal agencies. We'll be spending time vetting these opportunities through the next month and will share updates with you all as we gather more details.

In health,

Erik & Mariza, this is a great update — thank you for sharing. When are we catching up next?

Additionally, FYI see below screenshot — I believe the correct breakdown is likely Males: 49%, Females: 51% (vs 61%)?
