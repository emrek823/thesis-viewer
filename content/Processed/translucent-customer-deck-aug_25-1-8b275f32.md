## Slide 2: Why Now? Unprecedented Financial Pressure on Healthcare

Why Now? Unprecedented Financial Pressure on
Healthcare

**Factors Contributing to Financial Pressure on Healthcare:**
*   Labor Costs
*   Reimbursement
*   Interest Rates
*   Tariffs
*   Big Beautiful Bill

Finance teams are being asked to do more than ever — with
fewer resources and tighter timelines.

## Slide 3: Finance teams in healthcare are overwhelmed, under-resourced, and often resented

Finance teams in healthcare are overwhelmed,
under-resourced, and often resented

*   Finance teams spend 80% of their time stitching data together
*   Critical financial questions go unanswered or arrive too late
*   Tools were never built for the complexity of healthcare

## Slide 4: Why Traditional Financial Analysis Doesn't Scale

Why Traditional Financial Analysis Doesn't Scale

To be a financial analyst in healthcare, you need to be a:

*   Healthcare Domain Expert
*   Financial Strategist
*   Data Engineer
*   Business Translator

That's a unicorn. And no health system can hire 100 of them.

## Slide 5: Even if it was possible to hire top-tier Analysts at scale, it wouldn't solve the problem

Even if it was possible to hire top-tier Analysts
at scale, it wouldn't solve the problem

**Hiring analysts is unsustainable**
*   **Salary:** 125k–175k + benefits
*   **Hiring 50 costs:** $6M–$9M

**But data silos & broken processes are the real problem**
*   **5+ disconnected systems:** EHRs, ERPs, Excel, cost tools, BI dashboards
*   **Manual:** extraction, cleanup, reconciliation

## Slide 7: The Cost of Not Delivering Financial Insights at Scale is Massive

The Cost of Not Delivering
Financial Insights at Scale
is Massive

**Financial Impact Calculation:**

| Factor      | Value  |
| :---------- | :----- |
| REVENUE     | $5B    |
| IMPROVEMENT | 1%     |
| **VALUE LOST EACH YEAR** | **$93M** |

**Calculation Breakdown:**
$5B (REVENUE) * 1% (IMPROVEMENT) = $50M (lost potential improvement)
Wait, the slide shows $93M. This implies a different calculation or understanding of "1% improvement" or that $93M is the *total* cost of not delivering *all* insights. If 1% improvement is directly applied to revenue, it should be $50M. The slide states "$93M VALUE LOST EACH YEAR", which may incorporate other factors or represent 1% of something other than just revenue improvement or a cumulative effect. Assuming $93M is the final calculated value presented.

## Slide 9: We believe a healthy bottom line shouldn't be a rarity for medical clinics and hospitals

We believe a healthy bottom line
shouldn't be a rarity for medical
clinics and hospitals

*   **Hundreds of hospitals are on the brink** — over 600 rural hospitals are at risk of closure in the next few years.
*   **It's not a clinical failure — it's operational** — financial leaders can't get answers fast enough to make good decisions.
*   **AI can help, if done right** — built with deep context, connected data, and healthcare-grade safeguards.
