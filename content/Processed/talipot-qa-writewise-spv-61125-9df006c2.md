#### Product Offering Breakdown

With PMPM Guarantee, Rx Protect, and Subscription Rx, can you provide more of a detailed view of the parties involved, who holds the stop-loss risk, who are the stop-loss carriers, the PBMs, the TPAs, etc.? If an employer experienced a sudden increase in costs and / or we experience increased cost of care, how does that impact WriteWise under each of the 3 offerings?

We rephrased "Impact of Cost Increases” to “Impact of Drug Spend Increase” to be specific about the mechanism where the PBM will be responsible if their unit-cost guarantee on drugs increases. WriteWise uses cost AND utilization to predict overall spend.

PMPM Guarantee: The employer is paying for drug claims, and WriteWise just converts that into fixed monthly budget

Parties: Employers (or MGAs that pool smaller employer groups), PBMs (e.g., MedImpact, Procare), and WriteWise.

Risk Holder: WriteWise (via its TN captive) covers only a small corridor just above the PMPM cap (5-10% of the premium for that group). The PBM is also held to a unit-cost guarantee which WriteWise can claw back at the end of the year.

Impact of Drug Spend Increases: Employer costs don’t change. WriteWise still gets its PMPM fee. The captive surplus for WriteWise could potentially be tapped.

RxProtect (Stop-loss): Acts like typical spec/agg stop-loss coverage, but just carved out for pharmacy.

Parties: Employers, stop-loss carriers (e.g., SiriusPoint), MGUs, and WriteWise.

Risk Holder: The stop-loss issues the policy and assumes the bulk of the risk, while WriteWise’s downside is limited to its captive corridor.

Impact of Drug Spend Increases: Carriers absorb most of losses; WriteWise's fees are unaffected but captive surplus could be reduced (more below on captive specifically).

Subscription Rx. “Build a bear” formulary with smaller basket of drugs and less risk

Parties: Employers, TPA or direct (e.g., Breckpoint MEC), WriteWise

Risk Holder: Risk is embedded in fixed PEPM/PMPM fees. WriteWise assumes utilization risk if claims exceed premiums.

Impact of Drug Spend Increases: Subscription Rx is written for smaller groups on a narrow drug list (mostly generics and tier 2 brands with pre-negotiated net costs). Even if every eligible member maxes out the benefit, the extra spend tops out at only a few dollars PEPM.

#### TN Captive

Can you elaborate on TN captive? Does this need to scale as the program scales? That would be my assumption. How does this get capitalized? What is the % / $ required in reserves?

The sophistication the WriteWise team has brought to the captive structure has given them early advantages and allows them to access high-margin insurance products (vs. taking a smaller slice of value with SaaS) without actually being an insurance company themselves. The entire structure of these captives is enabled by WriteWise’s early high-quality underwriting performance (more in updated data room document here), which gives us confidence in growth moving forward.

WriteWise has 2 captive vehicles - 1 for PMPM guarantee (TN) and 1 for RxProtect (Cayman Islands, moving to TN).

Fundamentally, the captives provide 3 main advantages:

Access to reinsurance. A captive makes WriteWise an insurer on paper so they can access reinsurance. Reinsurance allows WriteWise to offload the tail risk (high costs above predicted spend) to a reinsurer for a fixed, predictable fee.

Financial discipline. The minimum required in the captives is $25K. More below, but for the PMPM guarantee for example, WriteWise proactively takes 25% of the premium and pays that into a captive. This is strictly for financial discipline so the dollars are not comingled with the entire WriteWise corporate entity. There is no restriction on what WriteWise can do with that capital.

Skin in the game. Establishing the captive shows reinsurance partners and fronting carriers that WriteWise has skin in the game. It demonstrates WriteWise is incentivized and committed to precision for loss ratios.

More specifics on the 2 captives below.

PMPM Guarantee: WriteWise’s current TN captive is responsible for 5% of costs above the predicted premium while the tail risk is offloaded to reinsurers. So if WriteWise predicts premiums will be $1M and it’s $1.3M, which would be catastrophically poor underwriting, they are responsible for $15K (5% *$300K) out of the captive while reinsurer pays the rest. For each contract the company puts 25% of the premium ($250K for $1m premium written) into the captive. To emphasize, this is more than is required. WriteWise does so for financial hygiene/discipline and optionality in the future. There is no restriction (beyond low statutory minimums of $25K) with what WriteWise can do with the surplus in the captive. Any portion of the captive that isn’t used becomes surplus at year-end, which WriteWise can either dividend as profit or recycle for the next tranche of guaranteed premium.

RxProtect: The RxProtext captive is in the Cayman Islands and moving to Tennessee this year for back-end simplification (tax, admin, etc). The Cayman captive only requires $25K, but WriteWise started with $200K to show alignment and to smooth early volatility. For a specific example to show how dollars flow going forward: an employer is paying $1M on stop-loss premiums for $10M in predicted pharmacy spend. WriteWise takes its 10% underwriting fee of the $1M stop-loss premium ($100K) and pays out another 10% to other admin (TPAs, broker, etc) and we are left with $800K. WriteWise puts $400K in the captive and gives $400K to Sirius. If pharmacy costs come in below $10M, WriteWise keeps the $400K. When costs increase beyond $12.5M (125% of $10M), Sirius and WriteWise split the risk 50/50 as well.

Going forward, the money required in the captive will not scale linearly with premiums. WriteWise’s early work to strategically set up the captives for financial discipline and access to reinsurance will benefit them as their book grows and surplus can continue to be recycled.

#### Contract Structure

What are the terms and structure of the contracts with their customers for each of the 3 insurance types? What is fixed? What is variable? Term for each? When does WriteWise get paid? When does WriteWise recognize revenue?

The variability in PMPM Guarantee and RxProtect is absorbed by WriteWise’s captive and anything beyond that passes to the stop-loss carrier/reinsurer. All variability in Subscription Rx flows straight through to gross margin.

PMPM: 12-month contract where employer pays fixed admin fee monthly ($11 PMPM on average.

RxProtect: 12-month stop-loss policy where WriteWise receives 10% of the premium as underwriting fee monthly.

SubscriptionRx: Monthly, Fixed PEPM/PMPM payments ($6 to $60 per month). If utilization is higher than expected, it will impact gross margin.

Is the ARR outlined in the financials section based on contracted minimums for each customer, or are they based on expected revenue generated by the variable component depended on claims volume? What % if variable vs. fixed?

All revenue shown in the financial model is a result of PMPM fees from PMPM guarantee, monthly underwriting fees from RxProtect (10%), or the full PMPM for Subscription Rx. Upside for captive surplus is not shown for RxProtect and PMPM guarantee is not shown.

At a higher level, we like the contract structure for WriteWise compared to other employer benefit models because of the $ / employer lives and the up-front, locked in economics. WriteWise’s fee is fixed from day 1 and there is no activation hurdle we see in other employer benefit models (e.g., B2B2C hunting license after signing a contract). There are some contracts with MGAs, such as HIT, where WriteWise is conservatively forecasting a smaller percentage of the HIT book (50% in 2025, full rollout 1/1/2026) of employers as WriteWise grows into the full employee base. This is reflective of the conservative modeling of the management team, and the MGA route is an attractive channel to scale the number of employer lives.

#### Financials

Can you get historical P&L for 2024 and YTD 2025?

What does the company expect to do in actual revenue in 2025?

Assuming June 2025 looks like May 2025 (conservative) from the historical P&L and looking at the financial forecast for H1-2025, we expect WriteWise to do $2.1M in recognized revenue in 2025.

Below is how revenue is defined throughout. This is not experimental revenue, pilots, or ARR based on hunting licenses or contingencies. As mentioned above, this is locked-in, upfront economics based on the premium dollar where signed to deployed ARR is more a function of employer’s benefits season.

Signed ARR: Contract is signed with employer. Currently $2.8M in signed ARR.

Deployed ARR: ARR is deployed after effective date (shown in model). $1.23M in deployed ARR currently.

Recognized Revenue: Total revenue recognized over a period as a result of deployed contracts. $465K in recognized revenue as of May 2025 (shown in historical P&L).

How can Virtue be confident in their potential to reach $10M in ARR by 2026?

We have confidence WriteWise can recreate their success over the last 6 months to reach $10M in signed ARR (noted above) by the end of 2026.

The context behind recent growth informs how we project growth going forward. For reference, at the November 2024 board meeting, we had $43.3k in signed and deployed ARR (WNY = $30K on 9/1/24 and City of Bayonne = $14.3K on 7/1/24) and an advanced pipeline of $220K in ARR. Over the last 6 months (Dec - May), WriteWise has grown to $2.8M of signed ARR ($1.2M in deployed ARR) and a high-confidence pipeline of an additional $10.3M across multiple product lines.

This growth over the last 6 months is reflective of key foundational work done throughout 2024.

Product development. The platform was ready for scale at the end of 2024. WriteWise acquired historical claims data to train their initial model, improved that model based on real data from customers, and built out the workflow tools (e.g., PBM auditing) to support customer implementation.

GTM sophistication. There was always a vision to sell multiple products based on the same underlying platform, but the value proposition for different products was refined over the last 9 months. For example, WriteWise leaned more into PMPM guarantee given reception from market and better economics back to WriteWise. They were also able to figure out the ideal way to align all stakeholders, whether it is encouraging PBMs to bid for more business in the marketplace or ensuring broker’s fees were protected. The confidence in this refined GTM strategy has led to more concentrated outreach and the signed ARR and pipeline we see today.

Conservatively, if all WriteWise does is recreate the last 6 months with $2-$3M in signed ARR every 6 months, we reach $10M in signed ARR ($6M deployed ARR) at the end of 2026. The current pipeline and continued conversations with customers throughout May and June give us more confidence. The pipeline they have generated are new logos over the last 6 months and not a stale pipeline where these leads have been sitting in the funnel for 12 months to “beef up” the pipeline.

#### Market Trends

It would be helpful to know more about the current regulatory environment. New entrants to these plans may not have the sophistication to understand all ERISA compliance requirements, certain Affordable Care Act provisions, nondiscrimination rules, potential changes to stop-loss regulation, etc. Also, I'm curious about WriteWise's exposure to fiduciary risk as being involved in recommending or providing lower-cost care that is not appropriate.

Under ERISA, the employer is the named fiduciary. Vendors like WriteWise become fiduciaries only if they control plan assets or make benefit decisions. WriteWise simply sells two state-regulated insurance contracts (RxProtect stop-loss and a PMPM reimbursement guarantee).

On the employer side, WriteWise improves compliance and helps reduce any potential headaches. First, WriteWise presents a single line item that simplifies all downstream processes. The complexity we’re describing here is shielded from the employer and they are offered one fixed rate with no formulary disruption. Second, WriteWise’s ongoing monitoring features provide additional data to support any compliance needs. Third, the transparency WriteWise brings allows employer sponsors to actually act as fiduciaries on behalf of their employees to bring down costs. Employers who don’t have transparent, audited pharmacy spend are now getting sued by their employees.

How does consolidation of TPA's impact WriteWise?

Consolidation helps WriteWise. One integration with a scaled TPA unlocks hundreds of self-insured groups. Large TPAs are also under pressure to bring differentiated pharmacy risk tools to brokers and WriteWise provides a differentiated offering they can even white-label if they prefer. For other models, it may be a concern that larger TPAs have pricing power and can reduce PMPM costs. This is less of a concern for WriteWise because their margin comes from underwriting fees and performance, not the TPA’s admin budget.

What solutions are being replaced and what are the comparable cost structures?

At a high-level, WriteWise is supporting the growth of transparent PBM structures. Today, that is helping transparent PBMs (CapitalRx, SmithRx, MedImpact, etc) win more business with employers. In the future, that could be partnering with the big 3 PBMs as they are forced (by market forces or regulation) to change their practices. At a more micro-level, WriteWise is purposefully not focusing on replacing constituents in the employer stack today (PBM, brokers, TPAs, PBM consultants, etc) but partnering with those channels to align incentives.

More specifics on cost structures with Big 3 PBMs, transparent PBMs alone, and difference with WriteWise below.

Big 3 PBMs: Caremark (CVS), Express Scripts (Cigna) and Optum Rx (UnitedHealth) control ~80 % of all U.S. prescriptions and are now vertically integrated with mail-order, specialty pharmacy, and health-insurance arms, giving them unique levers to monetize drug spend. Their scale lets them retain spread on generics, capture rebate float that inflates list prices and member OOP costs, and mark up specialty generics by 100-1000+%.

Why transparent PBMs can’t do on their own: Transparent PBMs fundamentally can’t underwrite against their own balance sheets and customers don’t trust them to audit themselves (e.g., can’t grade your own homework!). Beyond that, WriteWise provides cost-savings on formulary and risk methodology in addition to price competition in a marketplace.

Formulary / Risk Methodology: Transparent PBMs still leave employers exposed to net unit cost ingredient risk, generic/channel spread differentials, and shock-claim tail risk that keeps pharmacy stop-loss premiums high. WriteWise not only further reduces these costs but provides cost certainty, an extremely powerful lever for CFOs that want predicability in spend.

Marketplace: WriteWise has created a marketplace where PBMs bid on business for employers, further driving down costs (image below from data room slides here)

What is the true market within this larger entity niche, and not just volume?

~75M lives are in self-funded employer plans in employers with <20,000 employees (conservative vs. 50,000 employees) and WriteWise can charge $11 PMPM (conservative; based on current contracts) for $10B TAM for <20,000 employers alone.

We broke down the the self-insured employer market (market sizing here in data room) even more so to reflect the opportunity WriteWise has in the <20,000 employee market for self-insured employers and how they can move up market over time as transparent PBMs penetrate more of the larger employer groups and the Big 3 PBMs are forced to evolve to more transparent structures.

#### Financing

What is the current capitalization of the company? Total amount raised since inception? How much capital did the founders personally invest? Any outstanding convertible securities? Would any convert to equity upon the $5M round?

Only external capital into the business was the $5m seed priced equity round at $20m post-money in Q3-2023. Confirming founder investment amount.

What is the fee structure of the SPV? We are trying to target 0/0. Is this the case?

We haven't set a carry fee (%) just yet though we haven't had any pushback on a potential 15-20% range. No mgmt fees and legal pro rated across participation. The plan in Fund I is to attribute any upside (e.g. distributions) associated with any Fund I SPV regardless of participation. So, a SPV investment can effectively be treated/viewed as a typical core investment check. Additionally, the SPV participant has upside in two  ways - 1) upside directly associated with the SPV specific to your position; and 2) upside associated with SPV associated with Virtue position that is treated as a core position and would be distributed back to existing LPs. We believe this represents 'good LP hygiene' and we came to this conclusion after discussing with Cendana.
