### Tirzepatide in Adults With Type 1 Diabetes: A Phase 2 Randomized Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trial.

In adults with type 1 diabetes and obesity, tirzepatide caused an average 10.3 kg (22.7 lb) weight loss over 12 weeks compared to just 0.7 kg in the placebo group - that's nearly 9% of their body weight lost.
