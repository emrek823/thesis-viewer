**Client**
Hi. Thanks for taking the time to talk with me. I am interested in learning more about basically AI technology within the prior authorization space that including Anterior and some of the other companies that we mentioned, but just looking to learn differentiating product features and also just broader market trends in general. Maybe do you mind just starting off speaking about your current role and what you do on a day-to-day basis in your organization.

**Expert**
Yes, absolutely. My role at CVS Health as the director of AI analytics is divided in two key pillars. The first one is as a people manager of a team of data scientists, data engineers, analytics consultants. We develop end-to-end analytic solutions and AI solutions for the Caremark business. Essentially the pharmacy benefit management business of CVS Health and as part of this business, one of the key type of solutions is around prior authorization.

The data that goes into prior authorization but also supporting the operation and the PA ops team specifically. The second major pillar is that as part of the technology leadership of the tech organization of CVS Health, I advise our senior leadership in terms of the capabilities, the data and also the external partnership we engage with.

**Client**
Great to hear. It looks like you are currently piloting Anterior, which was formerly known as Co:Helm?

**Expert**
Excuse me, formerly known as?

**Client**
Co:Helm I believe Anterior is the Anterior now that you guys are using?

**Expert**
Yeah. We are, more specifically, we actually partner with them to serve our clients some of our clients. Mostly for our own prior authorization, we develop in-house solutions, but we partner with Anterior largely to support some of our clients for the PBM.

**Client**
Okay. How does that work specifically, what's your involvement with Anterior and how do you partner with them?

**Expert**
We are very closely involved because essentially the process of prior authorization relies on questionnaires and specific rules that we as the PBM essentially set for those clients that have Caremark as a PA administrator. We work very closely with Anterior to make sure that the solution they roll out to our clients essentially are powered by the logic and the rules that we set as a PBM.

This is truly a free body partnership where Anterior works with us and our PA operation team and then what they do is essentially set up all the operations for the PA processing for those clients that don't have a capability of setting their own PA ops team. This could be self-employed employers, could be health plans or other type of programs.

**Client**
Very helpful. How familiar are you with Anterior in a competitive standpoint? How familiar are you with their competitors and just the competitive landscape?

**Expert**
I'm very familiar also because we had to go through the process of finding what was the best partner for us to set up this type of partnership. I can speak definitely more from a tech standpoint, but also in part in terms of the competitive landscape and other companies that are out there that are covering prior authorization AI or prior authorization technology in general.

Some have more of a flavor that has more to do with setting up the infrastructure, some more to automate and design the actual questionnaires and the actual criteria to define how to approve or deny a prior authorization. Some instead actually work a little bit at the end of this process and mostly process the prior authorization data to extract insights or extract guidance on certain operational or care management optimization needs, for example, or even fraud analytics.

**Client**
Very helpful. Who would you say is Anterior's largest competitor, especially doing prior authorizations on the payer side?

**Expert**
You said specialized specifically for insurers. Is that your question?

**Client**
From my understanding, I can tell that Anterior is using their AI platform for different medical reviews, but specifically on the payer side, whereas I know most prior auth is on a lot of these companies are focused on providers, whereas Anterior is focused on the payers. I'm curious who you view as the closest competitor that is also focused on the payer and go-to-market on the payer side for prior auth.

**Expert**
I would say there are two important competitors with different flavors, at least two. One is Cohere Health I would say is a very broader offering vendor. It's not limited to the prior authorization, but they also cover the prior authorization as part of their products for insurers. They are very strong in the market. Cohere Health definitely is a major competitor. There is a second one that is very important, specifically thinking about insurers, which is Codoxo.

Codoxo specializes more on the detection of fraud or waste within the prior authorization process. It's more niche but also tailored specifically to insurers. Most of their clients are large insurers. There are other companies that are very important, but I would say they probably would then fall more into the category of designing the prior authorization framework, the question, the criteria.

In large part these companies are in the business of pharmacy benefit management because at that point to essentially define those criteria you need to know how to run utilization management programs, which is what PBM typically does. Some of the more tech or digital native PBMs are very competitive in this field. Some of them are, for example, Capital Rx, which is a smaller but very rapidly growing PBM, MIS Rx or then the big ones like us, Caremark and other large, highly capitalized PBMs that instead play more because of their scale.

**Client**
Very helpful. What would you say is Anterior's biggest differentiator or what really gives them a defensible moat in this market against their competitors? What makes them better?

**Expert**
I think if I had to pick the one single thing that sets them apart, in terms of within that group that we discussed, which is tailoring to insurers. I would say the major thing, it's really the technology underlying their solutions. The fact that it's super easy to essentially set up the entire prior authorization workflow and the entire, let's call it, infrastructure software for a company that adopts them and in a matter of a few days you can get running your PAs and have already not only the logic that you need there but truly the tools for the prior authorization adjudicators.

At the end of the day, what they do is really a lot of automation and tooling for those SMEs that then have to, no matter what, either approve or deny each single prior authorization. The entire package is easy to get, easy to install, easy to get running for organizations that have no other support to do that.

**Client**
Thank you for taking the time to speak with me. Have a nice day.
