## Abstract
This proposed rule focuses on deregulatory actions identified in HHS regulations regarding Health information technology standards, implementation specifications, and certification criteria and certification programs for health information technology, and information blocking. This proposed rule seeks to reduce burden, offer flexibility to both developers and providers, and support innovation through the removal and revisions of certain certification criteria and regulatory provisions. This proposed rule also seeks to address reported misuse and abuse of information blocking definitions and exceptions.
