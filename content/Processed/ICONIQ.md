|          | Each datapoint (n) represents a single fiscal quarter of data per company included. A given company’s quarterly datapoints can be included multiple times in aggregated views (for example, by ARR scale) where we have more historical data. |

## Public Companies

The dataset includes 10 public companies that are not (and have not previously been) our venture and growth portfolio companies. All data was collected from public filings information³. These companies were categorized as top IPO performers because they ranked in the top quartile in two or more of the following criteria:

1. Indication of Success of IPO: Forward Revenue Multiple at IPO
2. Indication of Success Post-IPO: Current Forward Revenue Multiple
3. Indication of Value Creation: Ratio of Change in Stock Price Since Day 1 Close vs. Market (S&#x26;P)

## Additional Data Sources

Where noted, we have supplemented our core analysis with various proprietary ICONIQ surveys and publicly available information. These sources include:

1. ICONIQ Gen AI Survey (April 2025), n = 300
2. ICONIQ proprietary survey of GTM executives (April 2025), n = 205
3. ICONIQ Annual Growth Operating Trends Survey (March 2025), n = 58

# Executive Summary

## Public Market Context: Efficient Growth Has Become the Primary Signal, and AI is Reshaping Expectations

Following two years of macro-driven volatility and performance misses, the public software market is beginning to show signs of stabilization, underpinned by improved forecasting, better execution, and rising investor confidence in AI tailwinds.

- Public company valuation multiples remain below historical peaks, but early signs point to renewed investor appetite for high-growth companies.
- The Rule of 40 has emerged as the strongest predictor of valuation, with correlation to public multiples consistently surpassing growth or NRR over the last year.
- However, growth still commands a premium: A 1-point increase in revenue growth has ~2x the impact on valuation compared to an equivalent increase in FCF margin.
- Beat rates are recovering: Median beat vs. guidance is ~2.2% in Q1 2025, suggesting software companies are generally managing volatility, and some are beginning to benefit from AI-driven demand.
- AI is now a pervasive theme: 94% of public earnings calls mention AI, with rising focus on “AI agents” and tangible product investments.
- Private markets are doubling down: AI company funding in 1H 2025 (~$377B) has already exceeded the amount in all of 2024, reflecting strong conviction in the next frontier of software.

After a turbulent reset period, the market is recalibrating - rewarding companies that demonstrate not just growth and discipline, but also a credible AI strategy. Investors are anchoring on efficiency today across the broader software market, but placing option value on an AI-fueled upside tomorrow. We are also seeing AI-native companies redefine the growth curve, reshaping expectations across the market, and emerge with a new playbook.

# Executive Summary

## Software Fundamentals: Stabilizing
### The New Levers of Efficiency: AI and Workforce Redesign

As market volatility abates, software fundamentals are showing signs of equilibrium. While top-line momentum remains uneven, companies are driving meaningful bottom-line improvements through efficiency-first execution.

- **ARR growth** has leveled off across the broader software market; green shoots are emerging in mid-stage ($50-100M ARR) companies.
- **Net dollar retention** is settling at a ~110–120% range, particularly strong among early-stage companies; churn and downsell remain stable.

Beneath the improving metrics is a broader operational transformation. Companies are not just cutting costs – they are rewiring how they scale.

- **AI adoption** is nearly universal: 80% of companies report active experimentation or implementation of internal AI tools across workflows, with adoption expected to grow through 2026.
- **Offshoring** is also accelerating, with offshore headcount rising from 24% to 30% of the workforce YoY, particularly in engineering and support roles.

## Efficiency metrics are starting to show real traction:
- **CAC payback** remains extended at ~16 months for top quartile companies, but appears to have plateaued.
- **Rule of 40** is holding at ~50%, with FCF now contributing ~45% of the composite - a reversal from growth-dominated years.
- **Net magic number** has stopped declining, signaling GTM efficacy is stabilizing.
- **ARR per FTE** is improving, and outpaces OpEx per FTE, indicating real leverage from org redesigns, AI tooling, and workforce shifts.

## These shifts are translating into real outcomes:
- High AI adopters report improvements across key sales efficiency and R&#x26;D productivity indicators.
- Burn multiples are gradually improving, as automation and labor arbitrage increase productivity.

# Executive Summary

## Age of AI: A New Operating Model Is Emerging

AI is no longer just a product feature – we believe it is reshaping the entire operating model of modern software companies, from how products are built to how revenue is captured, teams are structured, and value is measured.

AI-native companies are dedicating more GTM headcount to post-sales and utilizing forward-deployed engineers to bridge the gap between AI capabilities and business impact. AI-native companies are also building high-leverage teams, prioritizing R&#x26;D headcount and technical fluency.

AI-native companies are redefining the growth curve - scaling 2-3x faster, more leanly, and more efficiently than traditional SaaS peers. They reach $100M ARR in just 1-2 years, often with fewer than 20 employees, and convert trials at nearly double the industry rate.

But these outcomes are not just the result of product velocity - they stem from a fundamentally different go-to-market and organizational playbook.

Even in an AI-transformed environment, the fundamentals of enduring software businesses still apply - growth, retention, efficiency, and scalability. But the bar has been raised. The winning teams are adapting those fundamentals to a faster, more technical, and AI-native world. We believe the ICONIQ Enterprise Five remain reliable markers of excellence across scale. What is changing is how quickly and efficiently companies are expected to hit them.

# State of the Market ICONIQ

## Rule of 40 has emerged as the dominant signal for valuation, signaling the importance of efficient growth

### Correlation Analysis of Various Drivers
**R-squared to EV / NTM Revenue, Public Enterprise SaaS Companies**

| Driver                | R-squared |
|----------------------|-----------|
| Revenue Growth       | 49%       |
| Net Revenue Retention | 41%       |
| Rule of 40          | 12%       |
| Gross Margin         | 5%        |
| FCF Margin           | 2%        |

We hypothesize the decline in correlations in Q2’25 is likely due to market environment changes rather than company fundamentals, with valuation multiples likely more impacted by macro risk factors (e.g. interest rates, geopolitical uncertainty, etc.) and narrative shifts in investor focus (i.e. AI-driven TAM).

# Age of AI: Traditional SaaS vs AI-Native Moats

**ICONIQ**

In the AI-native era, we believe defensibility hinges on learning loops, embedded intelligence, and rapid iteration – not just distribution or scale.

## Building Defensible Moats in the AI Era

| Traditional SaaS | AI-Native Companies |
|------------------|---------------------|
| Aggregated data ownership, often built around access to structured business data | Feedback loops, context-rich behavioral data, self-improving models |
| Feature velocity, versioned releases, longer feedback cycles | Rapid experimentation, modular design, faster learning from usage |
| Workflow automation, data lock-in, switching cost through complexity | Embedded decision-making, output customization, real-time learning |
| Sales-led distribution, role-based access, SLAs, compliance standards | Embedded daily use, internal virality, AI utility-driven network effects |
| Partner ecosystems, expansion with orgs | Emergent risks around model bias, data leakage, hallucinations, and evolving regulatory gaps requiring transparent and auditable AI decisions |

AI companies also have shorter sale cycles than non-AI companies (22 vs 26 weeks).

Read more in our State of GTM Report.

AI-Native companies generally show higher conversion rates within the sales funnel, suggesting that the ROI on their products are more immediately clear and valuable to customers. This allows them to convert interest into revenue more efficiently – an even greater advantage in times of macroeconomic uncertainty.

Age of AI                                       ICONIQ

One example of this trend is the rise of forward-deployed engineers, who allow AI companies to bridge the gap
between product capability and customer outcomes

 Forward Deployed Engineer Hiring Trend¹
Active Employers Hiring and Job Vacancies

# Age of AI: FCF Margin

**ICONIQ**

While AI-native companies can demonstrate tremendous growth compared to their non-AI peers, they also burn cash more aggressively, driven by elevated infrastructure and capital expenditures (e.g., compute costs, GPUs).

## FCF Margin
### Median, by AI Product Maturity and ARR Range

|                | &#x3C;$100M | $100M+ |
|----------------|--------|--------|
| AI-Native      | -10%   | -126%  |

# Age of AI: Operational Efficiency

**ICONIQ**

Despite lower FCF margins, later-stage AI-native companies generally show superior burn efficiency, driven by faster compounding of ARR.

## Burn Multiple (FCF / Net New ARR)
**Median, by AI Product Maturity and ARR Range, unprofitable companies only**

| ARR Range | AI Product Maturity | Burn Multiple |
|-----------|---------------------|---------------|
| &#x3C;$100M¹   | AI-Native           | 1.9x          |
|           | AI-Enabled          | 2.0x          |
|           | Non-AI Company      | 1.8x          |
|           |                     |               |
| $100M+    | AI-Native           | 1.6x          |
|           | AI-Enabled          | 0.8x          |
|           | Non-AI Company      | 0.4x          |

While application layer AI companies can demonstrate superior burn, foundational model layer AI companies may have higher burn multiples due to capital intensity and infrastructure costs.¹

## FCF Median Margin

| AI Product Maturity | FCF Median Margin | Median Net New ARR | N-Size |

|-------------------------------------|
| While growth trajectories may look very different in the age of AI, we believe the fundamental principles behind enduring software businesses still hold true. |

### Key Considerations
- What is your historical and projected growth?
- How does the product vision, market, and execution affect the sustainability and predictability of your growth?
- How are you managing recurring revenue and driving expansion of existing customers?
- What does performance look like on a per-unit basis?
- How does your gross margin affect growth and profitability?
- Do you have a clear path to profitability? What does your burn look like in comparison to net new revenue being generated?
