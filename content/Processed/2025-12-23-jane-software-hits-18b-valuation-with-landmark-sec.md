North Vancouver’s [Jane Software](https://jane.app/) is set to join the ranks of Canada’s most valuable private tech companies, with a new secondary financing round led by Silicon Valley’s TCV (formerly Technology Crossover Ventures) valuing the company at approximately $1.8 billion.

According to [*The Globe and Mail*](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-jane-software-hits-18-billion-valuation-as-tcv-leads-500-million/), the $500-million-plus deal—expected to close this week—will see U.S. investment firms TCV, JMI Equity, and Tidemark Management purchase shares from existing investors and employees. Notably, this is not a capital raise for Jane, but a liquidity event for early stakeholders in the high-performing company.

Founded in 2012, Jane has raised less than $10 million in primary funding but has grown into a leader in practice management software for small and medium-sized health care clinics. Today, more than 200,000 practitioners across 50,000 clinics in Canada, the U.S., and the U.K. use Jane to book appointments, manage billing, communicate with patients, and handle digital forms.

With approximately 650 employees, Jane is now generating close to US$100 million in annual revenue. Its co-founders, Alison Taylor and Trevor Johnston, launched the company after developing a custom tool for Taylor’s clinic that quickly attracted interest from other practitioners.

The company has remained profitable from the outset, scaling largely through word of mouth. During the tech sector’s downturn in 2022, Jane avoided layoffs and instead gave raises to its team.

Looking ahead, Jane is investing in artificial intelligence to further streamline clinic operations. Its first AI-powered tool, an “AI scribe” that generates clinical notes during patient meetings, reflects a broader push to integrate generative AI across its platform.

With this latest investment, Jane cements its place among Canada’s most successful bootstrapped tech companies—proving that profitability, patience, and product excellence still pay off.
