XX,

Hope all is well! Heads up, our portfolio company, Hermes Health, is raising a $5M seed round.

As background, Hermes Health is building the rails and infrastructure for identified health data ($80B+ market in US). Identified data is 10x more valuable than de-identified data, and Hermes has built a neutral middleware platform to access this data at scale for life sciences, health plans, attorneys, insurance companies, and healthcare analytics companies. HIEs, TEFCA, and other interoperability measures have created even more friction in the market during a time when AI has increased demand for identified data that enables direct patient-level action and clear provenance.

Alejandro Zamorano (CEO) launched and scaled Datavant’s direct to life science division in the de-identified world, and is bringing those lessons to the identified side of the house with Hermes. Hermes has built out its network on the data supply side, is monetizing demand, and raising to scale its network and expand to new use cases.

Let us know and we can intro you to Alejandro!

Thanks,

Emre

Biggest question

Size of market (who’s pulling records today)

Who’s got data

Is it fragmented enough network where a platform is useful
