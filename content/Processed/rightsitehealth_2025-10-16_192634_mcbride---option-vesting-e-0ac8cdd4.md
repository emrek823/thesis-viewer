### STOCK OPTIONS.
Subject to approval by the Company's Board of Directors and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Company's 2023 Equity Incentive Plan and the applicable stock option agreement, Consultant shall be granted an option to purchase up to 1.10% of the Company's fully diluted Common Stock (as currently constituted).

Such options shall be subject to vesting, performance milestones, and the Company's standard repurchase rights as set forth in the applicable stock option agreement.

*   **Signing Bonus / SME Equity:** 20 bps, fully vested upon execution of this Agreement, as compensation for subject matter expertise and payor-related activities.
*   **Advisory Board Equity:** 20 bps, subject to the Company's standard four-year vesting schedule under the applicable stock option agreement.
*   **Performance Equity:** 70 bps, contingent upon achieving performance milestones as set forth in the Performance Equity Table below.

## PERFORMANCE EQUITY DEFINITIONS AND SUMMARY:

*   **Tier 1:** Beachhead contracts that, once signed, facilitate additional case rate contracts in the same or other states.
*   **Tier 2:** Pull-through contracts that are incented at a lower rate, reflecting the reduced difficulty of closing after a Tier 1 contract has been secured and validated.
*   Consultant shall be eligible to earn performance equity for any case rate contract executed within 90 days following the termination of this Agreement, provided Consultant remains available for strategy or sales calls during that period.
