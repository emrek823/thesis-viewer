# AI-Powered Risk Adjustment for a full-risk Primary Care Group

HealthMC

## Summary
HealthMC partnered with a full-risk primary care group to improve risk adjustment by reviewing charts from both aligned and non-aligned providers.

The Result: **0.07 RAF V28 lift, >10x ROI, and significant EBITDA gains within three weeks.**

## Introduction
A full-risk primary care group engaged HealthMC to improve V28 performance. They wanted to assess whether coding gaps existed for non-aligned physicians and whether HealthMC's AI could improve accuracy or reduce operational expense.

## Initial Engagement
The Provider group shared sample claims and aligned charts. HealthMC identified target encounters and built a chase list. Though only ~25% of non-aligned charts were retrieved alongside their aligned charts, HealthMC demonstrated a 0.065 gross lift for coded patients without matching to claims. This convinced the group to engage HealthMC to optimize their risk adjustment performance across a large cohort.

## Challenges
Key challenges during the engagement included:
*   Identifying and prioritizing charts for retrieval
*   Triaging charts for relevance
*   Matching charts to incomplete claims
*   Verifying submission files (adds/deletes) for completeness and compliance
*   Converting submission files into multiple specific payor formats

Fortunately the HealthMC platform was designed specifically to manage these challenges.

## Strategies Implemented
HealthMC addressed each challenge using its proprietary technology:
1.  Generated separate chase lists for aligned and non-aligned providers
2.  Used AI to triage ineligible charts
3.  Matched 80%+ of charts to claims
4.  Used AI+Certified Coders to verify all adds/deletes
5.  Created compliant submission files across payors

Thousands of charts were processed within weeks thanks to AI-enabled speed.

## Setting a New Standard in Risk Adjustment

| Metric | Value | Description |
| :----------------------- | :---- | :--------------------- |
| Per Patient RAF Lift     | 0.07  | Per Patient RAF Lift   |
| Return on Investment     | 10x   | Return on Investment   |
| Coding to Submission     | 3 wks | Coding to Submission |

## Results
From 4.9 charts per patient acquired:
*   1.35 charts with eligible encounters per patient
*   0.07 per patient v28 net RAF lift
    *   0.09 lift from novel diagnoses
    *   0.02 removed for deleted diagnoses
HealthMC provided payor submission files, yielding a 10x ROI on collection and coding expense.

## Conclusion
This case highlights HealthMC's AI, hybrid coding model, and infrastructure as a scalable, revenue-boosting risk adjustment solution.
