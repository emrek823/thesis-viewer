# Datavant to Acquire DigitalOwl, Powering Faster, Smarter Medical Data Reviews

[The Newsroom](#)

New York, NY – Sept. 25, 2025 –[Datavant](https://www.datavant.com/), the data collaboration platform trusted for healthcare, today announced that it has signed an agreement to acquire [DigitalOwl](https://www.digitalowl.com/), a pioneer in AI-driven medical data analysis. With this acquisition, Datavant will expand its capabilities to make health data accessible and actionable for the legal and insurance industries.

Today’s time-consuming and error-prone medical record reviews delay case resolutions for legal clients and claim approvals for insurance members, while driving up costs that often are passed on to consumers. Datavant will solve these challenges by integrating DigitalOwl’s proprietary technology with Ontellus’ health records retrieval and claims intelligence capabilities to offer an end-to-end data collaboration platform. This secure platform will include managed retrieval, automated summaries, chronology and de-duplication, and AI-enabled predictive analytics. Datavant will leverage its deep expertise in the secure, compliant exchange of medical data to curate and deliver information to authorized users.

“Legal and insurance customers are looking to consolidate and simplify the process of finding, accessing and analyzing specific medical information from a vast amount of both structured and unstructured data sources,” said Kyle Armbrester, Datavant CEO. “DigitalOwl’s data extraction and summarization technology was built specifically for these use cases and, together with Ontellus’ and Datavant’s digital record exchange platform and  extensive provider network reach, we will transform a market that is ripe for change.”

DigitalOwl’s proprietary data extraction and AI technology classifies and annotates unstructured medical data, streamlining the review process and providing teams with actionable insights. DigitalOwl’s technology is continuously refined by an in-house team of data scientists and industry professionals with deep experience in insurance and legal processes. This ensures that insights are contextualized and delivered in a format that supports real-world decision-making. Recently recognized as the [2025 Natural Language Generation Platform of the Year](https://www.digitalowl.com/press-releases/digitalowl-natural-language-generation-platform) for medical record reviews, DigitalOwl’s platform is at the forefront of innovation in this category.

“Manually reviewing medical records and extracting the necessary information for underwriting, cases and claims work is time-consuming and costly,” said Yuval Man, CEO of DigitalOwl. “At DigitalOwl, we’ve focused exclusively on applying advanced technology to automate manual processes and address pain points across the workflow. Joining forces with Datavant will enable us to accelerate our mission and deliver even greater value for our partners and customers.”
