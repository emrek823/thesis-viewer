### Sales Strategy Balance

- Direct sales timeline significantly longer than distribution pipeline
- Parallel approach being pursued

- Larger health systems (18-system AHS in Midwest) require extended timelines
	- Right people alignment needed
	- Record reviews and integrations more complex

### Product Evolution and Vision

- Current wedge: CDI compliance comparing to policy requirements and federal regulations
- Long-term vision (2-3 years): Healthcare information ontology
	- Similar to Palantir’s Foundry product approach
	- Structure information from EHR/patient charts
	- Run specialized agents for administrative workflows
		- Compliance: federal regulation searches, policy gap identification
		- CDI: billing error addressing, clinical documentation compliance
- Short-term partnerships with benchmark providers
	- Surface insights from unstructured charts
	- Compare practice/provider performance to comparable hospitals
	- Especially valuable for middle market hospitals lacking resources

### Technical Context and Market Reality

- GPT-5 performance benchmarks shared
	- ICD-10 PCS (procedure coding): 15-20% accuracy
	- ICD-10 CM (clinical modification): approaching 50% accuracy
- Basic coding tasks remain challenging even for advanced models
- Creates value opportunity for specialized solutions

### Financing and Next Steps

- Fundraising increased to $1M pre-seed round
	- $250K allocated for advisors and angels
