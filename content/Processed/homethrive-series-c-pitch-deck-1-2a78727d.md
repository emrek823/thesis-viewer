## Slide 24: Generative AI Companion

### Data
Homethrive will be gathering a unique data set of conversations that our companions will have with members to learn what key ways do the elder population look for in helping resolve social isolation. This will be the foundation to how we train our models.

### Use Cases
There are 3 distant use cases we will work on in order of complexity
1.  Scheduling
2.  Tasks needed
3.  General Loneliness

### Implementation
We are already working with multiple LLMs (Google, OpenAI, etc.) and so we will continue to consider a multi LLM strategy to best build out the application of a voice bot tailored to the elder population aimed at solving social isolation.
