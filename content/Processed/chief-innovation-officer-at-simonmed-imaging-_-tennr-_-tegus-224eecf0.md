## Client
We appreciate you taking the time. We are trying to learn more about the automation tools across the health care industry, looking at names like LeanTaaS, Plenful, Tenable and we believe you're a customer of Tennr. And where you see customers to better understand the evaluation selection process, ROI, obviously, primarily product feedback. Maybe it will be great to get an understanding for your background and then your role at SimonMed and the overview of who SimonMed is?

## Expert
SimonMed is a national provider of imagining. In fact, they're the largest exclusively outpatient radiology imaging practice at now 200-plus locations and growing rapidly through acquisition and de novo growth. And essentially, we're physician owned until a few years back and then they were acquired by a private equity American Securities, was the PE at bottom and essentially fueled even more rapid growth. As part of that, they really filled out their C-suite and part of that was my hiring as the chief innovation officer.

And in this role, I oversee all, literally all innovation and technology and a lot of different areas from operations, finance, clinical initiatives, anywhere where we can improve our efficiency on what we had in our existing infrastructure and anything that I seek out or companies seek out, they come to me usually first to pitch their start-ups or whoever like even mature companies trying to break in, I'm usually in the first layer to be pitched. And yes, that's my role.

## Client
And help me give a sense for scale, or you will share anything about like number of employees or revenue scale for SimonMed generally.

## Expert
I would say revenue is we on the millions and billions. And I would say the employee count is probably over the thousands and I mean, it's a pretty huge organization that.

## Client
And just what you're saying is correct, you guys get referrals from anyone who needs imaging done. So typically like a primary care position or some other practice would say, hey, go to SimonMed. Are we seeing these patients come directly to you? How do you typically?

## Expert
It's very, very complicated. And I'm sure this will be uncovered in the course of the conversation, but radiology is extremely, extremely complicated compared to medicine or a lot of the other specialties in all the medicine. And you'll see that's because of exactly what you just said. We're not a health system. We don't have any joint ventures with hospital systems.

It's not like this automatic flow of patients coming from a unified upstream source. We are literally on the ground like collecting patients from tens of thousands of PCPs across both coasts and the Midwest and all over the place who have their own EMRs and own ordering patterns and own ordering styles and many of which still use prescription pads.

Essentially, and then also because we're relatively low cost compared to many of the major players out there, we have a whole segment of patients, which will seek us out. And there also were probably the most health plans out of any other organization in our space. So yes, we have patients come in from every which way.

## Client
You have some patients who are like, I know I need an X-ray. I'm going to go straight to SimonMed, and then many who are referred to you. I have an idea of some of the common use cases for Tennr. But can you just talk me through what your use cases are that you're using it for today?

## Expert
Our organization is very large now. And what I will say off the bat is that there are teams within SimonMed, which use or sorry, I don't even say use, which are piloting Tennr and for various tasks, very, very small level. From my standpoint, I look at things either that bubble up through the chain from the small level up and as use cases get bigger and bigger. When I am evaluating companies for our needs, I'm looking for more enterprise-wide solutions.

The use case right now that is being done at a small scale is I almost wanted just to keep it without getting too detailed is that it's almost below my visibility. But I will like to probably communicate which is what you want to probably conversation to go and it's not, you can tell me, is what I personally have evaluated for Tennr or end competitors for enterprise-wide solutions which is not what's being evaluated it for currently, sorry, which is not being utilized in that question right now. So it's two separate conversation. The conversation that I am interested in sharing with you is the big picture vision on how it impacts all of our work and how it impacts the field of radiology, if that's what you're interested in talking about.

## Client
I think we can focus there, it would be helpful to get that quick link of, okay, but what has been stood up first, like the current workflow of anyone's doing something. We can focus the conversation on what you are evaluating for the enterprise-wide adoption.

## Expert
Well, where I come in as far as evaluating Tennr, these little use case things, I don't even pay attention. To be honest with you, we have so many projects, were literally involved in hundreds of projects. So I hear a little bit in pieces. I can tell you right now, whatever is going on is still not good enough to present to myself or the CEO. It's just not that's why I'm saying like that's really not you probably want to focus me on right now.

## Client
Let's talk about what use cases are you evaluating Tennr for that you want to adopt enterprise-wide?

## Expert
Essentially, is the radiology, and we talked about this, this a very complicated pathway of entry. And just a national number because I don't want to talk about our number, which is I'll just say a similar. Nationally speaking, if you look at the national numbers for orders to conversion ratio, which is outside physician or some ordering physician or mid-level is ordering an X-ray or CT, MRI or whatever study, person ordering, what percentage convert to a scan?

That is lifeline of viability for radiology, not just for us but for everyone. And the national average is only 66%. There is billions of funds, billions of dollars out there waiting to be grabbed. But radiology practices are not savvy and have zero idea. I'm generally speaking on how to capture this 1/3 of orders that come in that don't get converted into a scan. And there is a ton of reasons for that.

But radiology as being as advanced as it has been in the adoption of artificial intelligence, has been very, very lacking from the operational and financial savvy. I would say, like Salesforce insights, Salesforce Health Insights, you talked to some of the executives over there, they're like, well, the radiology has been a laggard in adopting these insights because radiology, generally as a field thinks that they're just a downstream factory, like it comes in, report goes out. We don't really want to deal with the whole patient capture business. That's not on us.

Big picture, what the field will seismically change in the next few years. And my opinion is that radiology, the practices that really crush other practices and start taking over market share, are those that are putting the patient capture and the reducing leakage at the best clip. And I liking it when I'm talking to my other PEs or our own PEs and this and that, it's like likening it to what happened in dentistry and how it became so retail facing. How do you power that like, and not to stray too far unless you want to build some of these pieces out of the skeleton.

I'm laying out to you is that the companies like Tennr, which has done great things out of radiology, could be the nucleus or the heartbeat or whatever you want to call it, for driving savvy radiology practices because no one is in the space doing it.

And I will give you the competitors, the landscape et cetera if you're interested in but it's not coming, the competition is not at this time coming from companies like Tennr as of yet. This whole group of AI-driven workflows and automation-driven workflows, they have not even begun, not even the tip of the iceberg has sunk into the radiology market, which is going to be the most financially, in my estimation, the most financially lucrative business for all of these companies.

Because a single MRI conversion pays thousands of dollars, like talk about stopping leakage and getting a percent of rev share or however they want to structure the pricing deals, that is tens of millions of dollars of revenue for even a regional practice, not even someone our size, which would be like significant. I just gave you the TLDR version, like the conversation, now you can expand any points. I think that's probably the best way to do it because it's a lot.

## Client
Let's just start with like how in your dream you'd use Tennr to do so? What would the process be that you would utilize them for to reduce leakage?

## Expert
For an organization like ours, for example, number one pain point, I would say, is that we have like again, tens of thousands of PCPs, they're like referring positions, just like it could be, it's not a specialized. It could be a neurosurgeon ordering a head CT and a family practitioner ordering a shoulder X-ray or something like it.

It's all such a mass of inputs coming in and no unified way to capture this information. At the current moment, we integrate with over 100 different EMRs, like before starting, I didn't even know there was 100 EMRs. There's so much variability and so much noise and the humans that we hired to help solve this are not smart people, generally speaking, and it's overwhelming, it's confusing. And then a bulk of this that they're wasting their, sorry, spending their time on or you could say wasting, if you'd like, is on some low-level things. I mean, it's just so much FTEs have to be spent on just really, really low-level work, but it almost has to be because so much noise is coming in.

That's why a company, for example, just like Tennr or competitors can help right off the bat like clean up this noise using their large language models and AI. And it's all right over there. It's low-hanging fruit. And solve problem number one for like these large radiology practices. That's the first thing I would target right off the bat. It's not like medicine or it's not like Tennr was pitching but they have this partnership with some like, oh yes, we're in the ophthalmology space, and we have like fuel. It's so simple, it's so basic for a very, very siloed thing like ophthalmology.

But radiology is all comers from all different areas. And we're now you're talking about the patient self-putting like self-finding us and getting orders from physicians that they don't even refer to us. Now we're getting this notepad scribble, we're just wasting so many resources like well over 100 FTEs doing redundant, basic test which could be a cost savings of, if you're just looking at that you can extrapolate like it's not insignificant. We're spending like millions of dollars on this giant segment of full-time employees working on things that could be automated.

## Client
And your assumption is that by influencing Tennr to structure all this unstructured data, you will be able to reduce errors and therefore, have a higher efficiency in terms of reaching out to patients? Or how do you think that in-place Tennr will actually help patient.

## Expert
One is reduced costs by reducing our FTEs that are focused on this. I think I would just ballpark it, I think we can reduce our workforce probably by 75%. Just talking about this plus a couple of other points that bleed into this, which is prior authorization and scheduling higher outcome.

## Client
Are you thinking of higher workforce or just like 100 full-time employees that we talked about?

## Expert
75% of the teams that work on this, which will lead into scheduling, patient-facing outbound, prior authorization, just like if the data is solid, if the data is not needing so much human error. I mean, think about a human is transcribing this into, not only taking this from these inputs and putting it into our wrist and our other information systems like our version of EMR, but it's also all a manual process. So much human power is wasted on this.

And again, it bleeds into all these other areas, like outbound, outreach, scheduling, which are all like AI has not proven yet that you can handle all of these things, which even though we've been talking about this now for a year or two, no one is focused on the radiology space at all in this like no one. Just to answer your question, when you do a cost model of this, you're focused on reduction right off the bat, the easiest low-hanging fruit is when you're justifying this is like you're going to reduce your employees that are involved in this.

Then something to really dig into is that, unlike in other fields, radiology is very, very lucrative for certain exams. Now point two, we talked about point one, basic, very low-hanging fruit, reduction of employees. Now point two is and you alluded to this. It's like, now you're reducing your errors, which should lead to more conversion. But more important than that and related is that now you're sharpening your focus on the higher-end exams with purer "truth'' to base it off of.

When you're outreaching for that MRI, I am way more likely to have a conversion, which means one MRI could be thousands of dollars. I mean, we are confident that when the time comes that we can go full on AI powering all of these divisions because they're all related and radiology, they are all related, the patient-facing, the back end, the mid, all of this is all connected versus other.

But this is really, really heavy because we don't get the patient if the prior authorization is not done. If the patient feels like they have undue costs, they're not coming in. And the scheduling has to be accurate. If the patient is scheduled wrong, they have to reschedule. If a patient comes in and is rescheduled, they only have a 25% reconversion rate. So all of these pieces are all integral on this being done right the first time.

## Client
And we've talked about radiology versus other specialists. Something that's come up a lot is a number of specialists that do get referrals via just fax. What's the typical breakdown? Is it fax again for radiology? Or is there a different subset of ways that these referrals typically come in that makes it more complicated? How are they typically coming your door?

## Expert
Again, if we were a health system where we had joint ventures, this would be super easy because it all come through the same upstream source, but when we're pitching to the PCPs and all these different practices, we literally say we take anything from any which way.

By making our barrier of entry the easiest compared to our competitors, we have stolen a tremendous amount of business when we enter new markets. So literally, anything like patient brings in a piece of paper. A majority, I'll just tell you right now, the majority is e-fax, e-fax orders. We have some integration, which are good, but that's not a significant portion. It's mostly just like faxes coming in.

## Client
Majority is still fax for the sector and then you had today, just like literally a human takes the backs and then manually enters new patient information into your information system and it's like now reach out. There's a few nuances I want to push here. It feels like you said, such low-hanging fruit, when I talk about the fact that we're still talking about OCR for fax to just take data and put it in the right fields feels like some people have tried to accomplish it for.

## Expert
Any time we've been pitched this, oh yes, we'll take your fax and make data entry. No, never. I think it's always wrong. It's like you need multiple FTEs demand the conversion. And then they get lazy because these again, these are low skill workers, many are like high school or whatever, they don't care. And they're like, oh, computers right now. And saying bottom line is, they're doing it by themselves or they're reviewing what's done, either way it's shitty. I mean, it's an obvious cause of leakage, both ways.

## Client
I guess my first question is, are there any verticalized solutions that you have evaluated that are specific for radiology or that you think are comparable? And how do they compare to Tennr? comp landscape, but both horizontal and radiology specific.

## Expert
What I'll tell you is that some of the savvier PAC vendors, wrist vendors, scheduling companies and RCM companies are all starting to realize, very early days but are starting to realize that patient-facing is very, very important. And well, patient-facing, and back end is very, very important. Just the harmony of this is very important. What we have seen in the radiology space because no player outside the radiology space may be fine.

But the point is like we're starting to see just this year or within the last year, 1.5 years, these very interesting acquisitions where the wrist is the radiology version of EMR and medicine. It's a source of truth, it's the nucleus to the brain of the entire radiology operation. And all of this where we're calling truth is based in there. And all of this is populated by humans right now. And what we're seeing.

## Client
So you're saying the rest of the radiology version of the EMR, it's the source, the truth to the entire operation.

## Expert
Yes, and populated by humans, for the most part. I mean, there's some integration. But for the most part, it's populated by humans. And if you go to our other side, you can put yourself on the schedule and fill out all your information. Even patients filling things out via the web leads to so much noise, like they misclick here, a wrong letter in their last name completely screws you. So it's bad.

The point I was trying to make is that we're starting to see that these areas these different areas like RCM and scheduling or PACS in RCM, they're starting to be very smart acquisitions and mergers in the space to help reduce these different ecosystems that must engage with each other. In fact, they're integrating vertical, horizontal, whatever, point is that they're integrating so that way, it's not like this scheduling system is laying on top of the wrist.

And then the outreach is there, and now we're having higher resiliency because of that. What's happening now is that like you can look up like imagine the PAC acquired within health, which is this outreach engagement piece and scheduling piece. And finally, you're seeing all these pieces come together.

And what's going to happen because there's been a lot of fear with Salesforce coming in and providing these insights and there is a lot of recent fear from these major organizations that, hey, we need to do a better job providing insights to our company because otherwise, the savvy practices will look for the analytics to improve their performance because, again, like I said, there's billions of dollars left on the table every single year.

## Client
And what I'm thinking about the verticalized solutions, you're really saying the risk for someone like Tennr is that continued consolidation mitigates the need for it given that data can flow from end-to-end potentially.

## Expert
I think I had it in my head, but you just synthesized exactly what, yes, that's a very eloquent way to put it.

## Client
So that's a risk is the consolidation of the industry. Are there any point solutions today that you would say are head-to-head OCR, AI automation for this workflow that you have evaluated? Or you say not really today?

## Expert
Not really. But look, for example, look at Royal Solutions, it's a good example of what is the potential or what is a company that's trying to disrupt the space, Royal Solutions literally like it started off as an RCM only company because, again, in radiology, which is one of the richest specialties in medicine, there is the highest reimbursement cut pressure from the government.

Every year, there's a 10% cut looming. Royal realized that, hey, we're going to do our RCM different. We're going to think about this whole end-to-end piece a little bit more, not all the way, but more than any other RCM company, which is very human based.

And they came in and literally just destroyed the market. Literally took the majority I don't know the actual numbers, but whenever they pitch, it's like we have the majority of the market now. And they were like another. And using AI and reducing redundancies. And even though they're an RCM company, they bleed into the front-end patient engagement that scheduling all of this. So they're like that's the best example I can give you for what is possible in radiology.

## Client
And I think my POV coming into this call was that the market will be sustained specifically for this like just the referral workflow alone because fax isn't going away and saying like, if that's the thing, then it doesn't really matter like maybe someone else will create another solution that's directly competitive, but someone's going to need to build a solution that is simply just like this data entry from paper because regardless consolidation, it's not going to be that you're consolidating with Epic.

Do you think that's true, though, and I don't want to mean to lead the witness. But I am curious when I think about market sustainability like fax isn't going away, maybe there will be some consolidation on the other end, like within the vertical, but maybe this referral workflows stay. Would you say that's true? Or do you think that like, no, we might actually see an end-to-end data streamlined from the PCP?

## Expert
Not from the PCP. Again, I think there has to be a solution, faxes go away or not. I mean, maybe that's the way to better tease it out. But I would just argue that from our standpoint, it's like all I know is that we need a solution that can handle anything, faxes are here, faxes are not here. It's still going to be so much noise coming from so many places because there is not on the ground in the community, literally in the community, not in hospitals, but in the community, like there is so much resistance to change.

Epic will never get in. I know they're putting tens of millions of dollars and probably even more effort trying to break in the community, but there is so much resistance that I still think that the majority of radiology is done in the community. And there is still a massive, massive need for a company to provide end-to-end, whether it includes an OCR to capture this that, a more refined using AI this that, whatever, there is still a massive need for that.

## Client
Just play back to you the summary of how you and I can get together or taking through this comp landscape. It sounds like, look, the workflow is going to be necessary. You believe that maybe this will become a feature or attack on to a broader radiology specific solution. But if Tennr is first, we have advantage or whatever, like the workflow isn't going away, it once.

## Expert
No, I know. And that's a big like that's why it is a little bit surprising like companies in the Tennr space that are non-radiology like they have such an advantage over the thinkers that are currently in the radiology space. It's just shocking to me that one of these companies hasn't gone all in. And I wonder if it's just because it's too complicated, like is it too communicated? Why would they not? This is literally one of the richest fields, I'm saying complex, but it's also in some respects, it's pretty simple because there's less subjectivity, it's more cut and drier.

So in my mind, not being from the programming or fax side from that like to me, it seems like it's a layup, why don't one of these companies just go all in on this and capture this, have this huge lead time and start filling the market. I don't understand why that hasn't happened.

## Client
That all being said, you are paying customer for Tennr today. So I'm curious like, it seems like you think, hey, they might be able to solve the workflow within radiology alone. Can you talk me through you being.

## Expert
Oh sorry, I don't know your question, but I just think from the big picture, from my standpoint, from the enterprise level, they are not there yet today. Maybe there's vocal problems, it's just like it hasn't got to a point where it's got to our level, like the CEO and my level yet.

## Client
Do you know what they're missing? Do you know why it isn't ready?

## Expert
They haven't taken the time when I spoke with them, they have not taken the time or energy to understand the radiology landscape and the piece that involves such as the wrist, the way messaging comes in, the integration, our ecosystem. They have not taken the time to learn that yet.

## Client
And I think that one of the big questions for them is they're trying to be horizontal. They don't want to just be for one specialty. They want for every specialty. So if we said that tomorrow, they're like, hey, we're going to solve your radiology specific workflow. Do you have any sense for how long that would take them to implement a.

## Expert
That I would extend a co-development deal for some equity and tell them, hey, we want to build with you. You give us some either a percentage or like a no cost and will develop Tennr together. And let's go, like to build it out for radiology to own the market. That's what I would tell them, they actually said that in earnings.

## Client
Because I think what we're trying to understand is whether they have it generalizable enough workflow already that on to a specialty.

## Expert
What they have right now, it would not work for radiology today. I mean, for what we've talked about for the last 40 minutes is like radiology is not ophthalmology, where they're using the standard EMRs, and they have a standard set of things. It's just radiology is way complicated relatively. At least what I've been put in. If you've seen something different than maybe that's there. But I mean, it sounds like they have their play school at this time.

## Client
That all being said, I'm curious why now you think that someone like Tennr could come in and solve this? Is it LLMs or is there something in market that you think is the meaningful driver for why there's starting to be adoption across specialties for this patient intake, OCR type technology that has never really taken off to your point, you've been pitching a million times.

## Expert
It's not a shattering opinion, but all of us have been witnessed to what ChatGPT has done and seeing some of what is possible. The idea for being able to automate a lot of this redundant low-hanging fruit, we've discussed, which is like really, really basic stuff is there. It doesn't seem like it's that complicated.

We're not asking it to work out a complex authorization and deal with bad debt collection from someone who is over 120 days overdue. We're not asking something that's very humanoid. We're asking something that's actually very machine like, at least initially. So I just think more now more than ever, the technology should be there to execute and save us some good money and save us money and help us earn some of the high-end money that we have leaked.

## Client
This has been really informative for how you think about the ability to play out. I understand that you don't work with Tennr hand in hand today given that they're working at smaller scale. Do you have any sense of what the type of workflows that they're working on today that you guys are paying for? Or if you don't know, it's fine. I'm just.

## Expert
Like I said, at our company, we're working on literally hundreds of different projects unless something is like at the level and we're paying for all, like numerous, numerous things unless things are like enterprise wide where I think I see a pathway for moving the needle by millions or tens of millions of dollars. It's not ready for prime plan yet. I've done my diligence. So to answer your question, no, I can't comment on anything that we're actually paying for.

## Client
I think it's more accurate to say the Tennr is in a little bit of a pilot phase where there's projects being worked on, but the enterprise-wide rollout has not yet occurred, and they still need to prove to you that they can handle radiology specific workflows in order to do so.

## Expert
At least from my standpoint.

## Client
You've had theme and they pitched to you, and away like we'll circle back to this. Is that your level of interaction with them at this point?

## Expert
And I said, I don't want to be a guinea pig unless you want to do some deals together. That's the thing. Every one of these companies want to be in SimonMed, RedNet or RAD partner. You had a deal with one of us, big three, feel like your fate in radiology has completely changed because now you're in the big player. And I mean, literally, companies have blown up because of that.

## Client
But I kind of playing back to you as we've been going, just ensuring that I'm understanding, but I'm just going to take one minute to double check. I guess my only question is whether today you have any timeline in which you hope to evaluate Tennr for the enterprise-wide solution or do you think it's more in their court?

## Expert
We would love to see RSNA, the dream would be at RSNA, which is in December, some presence of Tennr and some of the competitors. And we would love for them to say, hey, look, there's a group of companies here that we're all focused on trying to earn your business. And we do this better than the radiology specific vendors who are doing much right now anyways. And let's see if we can get it. That's the dream. Let's see them ready for prime time at RSNA that I would love to see that.

## Client
And I guess last question for me. In terms of competitors, are you aware of any health care horizontal competitors that are doing something similar to Tennr today?

## Expert
And I've done some diligence just googling around. There are other companies too, but none of these companies like they're so far away from having a conversation in reality. It just seems like, they're all, just all the websites are identical, we use AI to automate workflow solutions and this and that like it's all generic. I just don't think any of them are ready for tackling radiology right now.

## Client
Amazing. Well, this is so helpful. I appreciate your help. Thank you for getting in touch with us. Have a good day!
