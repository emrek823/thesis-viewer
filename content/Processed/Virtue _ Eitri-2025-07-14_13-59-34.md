### Skylark Implementation Progress

- Signed contract for first year - $2,500 for MVP platform
- At end of build/feedback phase - received extensive PD data and files
- Took longer than expected to get the build
	- Originally planned for June implementation (from May deck)
	- Now mid-July - couple weeks delayed
	- 2 contractors done the bulk of the work over last 3-4 weeks
- Product capabilities now live:
	- Document ingestion and key information extraction
	- Results visualization
	- Basic LLM querying for outcome analysis
	- Quality checks (signatures, completeness)
- Upcoming Boston visit to deploy with Skylark team
- Engineering runs planned later this year - clinical scale testing against smaller scale runs

### Go-to-Market Strategy

- Leveraging Skylark as case study for additional similar use cases
- Transitioning Angel from internal champion to external advocate
	- Help identify prospects in his network
	- Advocate for value proposition to biotech peers
- Target markets:
	- Small/mid-sized biotech companies doing process development
	- CDMOs including companies like Forge
- Key pain point: Confirming manufacturing batch data aligns with expectations from prior batches or lab scale data

### Talent Acquisition Challenges

- Handful of compelling candidates on 1-2 month timelines:
	- Two Sahils at top of pipeline
	- Izzy Messker (former Royvent colleague)
	- Alan Raposo from Benchling (late August/early September)
- Main friction points:
	- “Why now” question - candidates unsure about timing
	- Risk profile concerns about being first engineer
	- Some self-select out feeling not right fit
- Strategy adjustments needed:
	- Increase outreach intensity and throughput
	- Better bridge big picture vision to specific near-term work
	- Avoid getting caught between too ambiguous vs too narrow positioning
- Contract development maintaining momentum while searching
- Emre connected Quinn with Emma for hiring process insights
