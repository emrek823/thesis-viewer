**Note: KFF now has a [clean summary](https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/health-provisions-in-the-2025-federal-budget-reconciliation-law/) of the health care provisions in the 2025 federal budget reconciliation law as well as a separate [implementation timeline](https://www.kff.org/implementation-dates-for-2025-budget-reconciliation-law/) highlighting key dates in the law.**  
This side-by-side comparison tool compares the health care provisions in the [House-passed](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1/text/eh?s=1&r=1&q=%7B%22search%22%3A%22hr1%22%7D) and [Senate-passed](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1/text?s=1&r=1&q=%7B%22search%22%3A%22chamberActionDateCode%3A%5C%222025-07-01%7C119%7C17000%5C%22+AND+billIsReserved%3A%5C%22N%5C%22%22%7D) 2025 budget reconciliation law to each other and prior law. The Senate-passed bill ultimately passed the House on July 3 and was signed into law by President Trump on July 4. The comparison is divided into four categories: Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act, Medicare and Health Savings Accounts (HSAs). It also compares the provisions to a earlier draft of the bill passed by [the House on May 22](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1/text?s=1&r=1&q=%7B%22search%22%3A%22hr1%22%7D).
