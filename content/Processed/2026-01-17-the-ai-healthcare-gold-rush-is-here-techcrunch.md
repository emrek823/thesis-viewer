AI companies are clustering around healthcare and fast.

In just the past week, OpenAI [bought health startup Torch](https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/12/openai-buys-tiny-health-records-startup-torch-for-reportedly-100m/), Anthropic launched [Claude for healthcare](https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/12/anthropic-announces-claude-for-healthcare-following-openais-chatgpt-health-reveal/), and Sam Altman-backed [MergeLabs closed a $250 million seed round](https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/15/openai-invests-in-sam-altmans-brain-computer-interface-startup-merge-labs/) at an $850 million valuation. The money and products are pouring into health [and voice AI](https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/13/elevenlabs-ceo-says-the-voice-ai-startup-crossed-330-million-arr-last-year/), but so are concerns about hallucination risks, inaccurate medical information, and massive security vulnerabilities in systems handling sensitive patient data.

Watch as [Equity](https://techcrunch.com/podcasts/equity/) podcast hosts Kirsten Korosec, Anthony Ha, and Sean O’Kane dig into why the AI world is suddenly obsessed with health care, what other products can expect an AI-makeover, and more.
