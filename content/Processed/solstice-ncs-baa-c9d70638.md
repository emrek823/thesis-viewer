2.1 **Permitted Uses and Disclosures.** Business Associate may not use or disclose PHI received or created pursuant to this Agreement except as necessary to perform the services set forth in the Underlying Agreement.

2.2 **Business Associate's Operations–Permitted Uses of PHI.** Business Associate may use the PHI it obtains, creates or maintains in its capacity as a Business Associate for the proper management and administration of Business Associate or to carry out Business Associate's legal responsibilities.

2.3 **Business Associate's Operations – Permitted Disclosures of PHI.** Business Associate may disclose the PHI it obtains, creates or maintains in its capacity as a Business Associate if such disclosure is necessary for the Business Associate's proper management and administration or to carry out the Business Associate's legal responsibilities, and:
* The disclosure is required by law; or
* Business Associate obtains reasonable assurances from the recipient of the PHI that the PHI will be held confidentially and used or further disclosed only as required by law or with such further authorizations required by law, and any such disclosure shall be only for the purpose for which it was initially disclosed to the recipient;
* The recipient notifies the Business Associate (and Business Associate in turn notifies Physician Practice) of any instances of which it is aware in which the confidentiality of the PHI has been breached; and
* Except for treatment disclosures, the Business Associate and its agents agree to use, disclose, or request only the limited data set (as defined in 45 C.F.R. §164.514(e)(2)), or if that is inadequate, the minimum PHI necessary to accomplish the intended purpose of that use, disclosure or request, and further agree that the party disclosing the PHI determines what constitutes the minimum necessary to accomplish the intended purpose of the disclosure. Business Associate understands that the HHS Secretary is mandated to issue guidance on what constitutes "minimum necessary," and agrees that Business Associate and its agents will be bound by that guidance when it is issued and becomes effective.

2.4 **Additional Obligations imposed by the HITECH Act.** Business Associate agrees to abide by all the following to the extent they are implicated by the Underlying Agreement:
a) Business Associate will not disclose PHI to a health plan if the individual to whom the PHI pertains has so requested and (1) the disclosure would be for the purposes of payment or health care operations, and not for the purposes of treatment, (2) the protected health information at issue pertains to a health care item or service for which the individual pays out-of-pocket and in full and 3) the disclosure is not required by law.
b) Business Associate agrees to comply with all privacy laws governing marketing communications, that is, communications about a product or service that encourages the recipient to purchase or use the product or service.
c) Business Associate agrees to clearly and conspicuously provide any recipient of health care fundraising communications the opportunity to opt out of receiving any further such solicitations.
d) Business Associate understands and agrees that it will be subject to the same penalties as a covered entity for any violation of the HIPAA Security requirements and for violations of the Privacy Rule for impermissible uses and disclosures, for a failure to provide breach notification to the covered entity, for a failure to provide access to a copy of electronic protected health information to either the covered entity, the individual, or the individual's designee, for a failure to disclose protected health information where required by the Secretary to investigate or determine the business associate's compliance with the HIPAA Rules, and for a failure to provide an accounting of disclosures, and it will also be subject to periodic audits by the HHS secretary. Business Associate further understands and agrees that its sub-Business Associates will be held to the same standards.
e) Business Associate agrees to comply with all privacy laws governing the sale of PHI.

2.5 **Minimum Necessary.** Except for treatment disclosures, the Business Associate and its agents agree to use, disclose, or request only the limited data set (as defined in 45 C.F.R. §164.514(e)(2)), or if that is inadequate, the minimum PHI necessary to accomplish the intended purpose of that use, disclosure or request, consistent with Physician Practice's minimum necessary policies and procedures. Business Associate understands that the HHS Secretary is mandated to issue guidance on what constitutes "minimum necessary," and agrees that Business Associate and its agents will be bound by that guidance when it is issued and becomes effective.

2.6 **Access to PHI by Individuals.** Business Associate shall cooperate with Physician Practice to fulfill all requests by individuals for access to the individual's PHI that are approved by Physician Practice. Business Associate shall cooperate with Physician Practice in all respects necessary for Physician Practice to comply with 45 C.F.R. §164.524 and state law, including but not limited to providing Physician Practice with copies of requested PHI and ePHI at least 5 business days prior to the date Physician Practice must provide the copies to the requestor. Business Associate further agrees that to the extent Business Associate maintains PHI of Physician Practice in an electronic health record (EHR) or other electronic Designated Record Set, the Physician Practice must comply with patients' requests for access to their PHI by giving them, or any entity that they designate clearly, conspicuously and specifically, the information in an electronic format, and must not charge the requestor more than the labor and supply costs in responding to the request for the copy (or summary or explanation).

If Business Associate receives a request from an individual for access to PHI, Business Associate immediately shall forward such request to Physician Practice. Physician Practice shall be solely responsible for determining the scope of PHI and Designated Record Set with respect to each request by an individual for access to PHI. If Business Associate maintains PHI in a Designated Record Set on behalf of Physician Practice, Business Associate shall permit any individual, upon authorization by Physician Practice, to access and obtain copies of the individual's PHI in accordance with 45 C.F.R. §164.524 and NM State law. Business Associate shall make the PHI available in the format requested by the individual and approved by Physician Practice, unless the PHI is not readily producible in such format, in which case the PHI shall be produced in hard copy format.] Business Associate may not charge the individual any fees for such access to PHI but shall provide written documentation to Physician Practice of the labor and supply costs Business Associate incurred producing the copies in the requested format. Physician Practice shall reimburse Business Associate for Business Associates documented labor and supply costs, to the extent they are allowed by law and Physician Practice recovers these costs from the requestor.

2.7 **Access to Business Associate's Books and Records.** Business Associate shall make its internal practices, books and records relating to the use and disclosure of PHI received from, or created or received by Business Associate on behalf of Physician Practice available to the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services for purposes of determining Physician Practice's compliance with the HIPAA laws and regulations. Upon reasonable notice to Business Associate and during Business Associate's normal business hours, Business Associate shall make such internal practices, books and records available to Physician Practice to inspect for purposes of determining compliance with this Agreement.

2.8 **Amendment of PHI.** If Business Associate receives a request from an individual for amendment of PHI, Business Associate immediately shall forward such request to Physician Practice. Physician Practice shall be solely responsible for determining the response to each request by an individual for amendment of PHI. As directed and in accordance with the time frames specified by Physician Practice, Business Associate shall incorporate all amendments or addenda to PHI received from Physician Practice. Within five (5) business days following Business Associate's amendment of PHI as directed by Physician Practice, Business Associate shall provide written notice to Physician Practice confirming that Business Associate has made the amendments or addenda to PHI as directed by Physician Practice and containing any other information as may be necessary for Physician Practice to provide adequate notice to the individual in accordance with 45 C.F.R. §164.526 and NM law.

2.9 **Disclosure Accounting.** In the event that Business Associate makes any disclosures of PHI that are subject to the accounting requirements of 45 C.F.R. §164.528, Business Associate promptly shall report such disclosures to Physician Practice. The notice by Business Associate to Physician Practice of the disclosure shall include the name of the individual, the recipient, and the reason for disclosure, and the date of the disclosure. Business Associate shall maintain a record of each such disclosure, including the date of the disclosure, the name and, if available, the address of the recipient of the PHI, a brief description of the PHI disclosed and a brief description of the purpose of the disclosure. Business Associate shall maintain this record for a period of six (6) years and make available to Physician Practice upon request in an electronic format so that Physician Practice may meet its disclosure accounting obligations under 45 C.F.R. §164.528.

If Business Associate receives a request from an individual for an accounting of disclosures, Business Associate immediately shall forward such request to Physician Practice. Physician Practice shall be solely responsible for responding to each request by an individual for an accounting of disclosures.

Business Associate understands that the HHS Secretary is mandated to adopt rules expanding the disclosure accounting obligations applicable to physician practices that maintain EHRs and agrees that Business Associate will be bound by those rules when they are issued and become effective.

2.10 **Security Safeguards.** Business Associate shall implement a documented information security program that includes administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to prevent the accidental or otherwise unauthorized use or disclosure of PHI, and the integrity and availability of electronic PHI (ePHI) it creates, receives, maintains or transmits on behalf of Physician Practice. The security program shall include all the reasonable and appropriate policies and procedures to comply with the standards, implementation specifications, and other requirements of the HIPAA Security Rule. In addition, Business Associate agrees to: (1) maintain written documentation of its policies and procedures, and of any action, activity or assessment which the HIPAA Security Rule requires to be documented; (2) retain this documentation for 6 years from the date of its creation or the date when it last was in effect, whichever is later; (3) make this documentation available to those persons responsible for implementing the procedures to which the documentation pertains; and (4) review this documentation periodically, and update it as needed in response to environmental or operational changes affecting the security of the electronic protected health information.

To the extent feasible, Business Associate agrees to encrypt all ePHI and destroy all paper PHI such that it is unusable, unreadable or indecipherable to unauthorized users.

Upon request, Business Associate shall make available Business Associate's documented security program, including the most recent ePHI risk analysis, policies, procedures, security incidents and responses and evidence of training.

2.11 **Reporting and Mitigating Unauthorized Uses and Disclosures of PHI.** Immediately upon discovery by Business Associate, Business Associate shall report to Physician Practice any uses or disclosures of PHI not authorized by this Agreement and, with respect to ePHI, any security incident, including any attempted or successful unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification, or destruction of ePHI or interference with information system operations.

Business Associate further agrees that, following the discovery of a breach of unsecured PHI, Business Associate will notify the Physician Practice of such a breach without unreasonable delay and in no case later than 30 calendar days after discovery of a breach. The notice will include, to the extent possible, the identity of each affected individual, and any other available information that the Physician Practice is required by 45 C.F.R. §164.404(c) to include in its notification to individuals. To the extent this information is not available when Business Associate notifies Physician Practice of the breach, Business Associate will provide it promptly thereafter as information becomes available.

Business Associate understands and agrees that a breach of unsecured PHI will be treated as "discovered" as of the first day on which Business Associate knew of the breach, or by exercising reasonable diligence, would have known of the breach. The knowledge and reasonable diligence of each of Business Associate's employees, officers or other agents shall be imputed to Business Associate, other than the knowledge of the employee, officer or agent who committed the breach. Business Associate further understands and agrees that as it is an agent of Physician Practice, the date Business Associate discovers (or should have discovered) the breach will be imputed to the Physician Practice.

To the extent a law enforcement official tells Business Associate that a notification, notice, or posting of a breach of unsecured PHI would impede a criminal investigation or cause damage to national security, Business Associate shall: (1) if the statement is in writing and specifies the time for which a delay is required, delay such notification, notice, or posting for the time period specified by the official; or (2) if the statement is made orally, document the statement, including the identity of the official making the statement, and delay the notification, notice, or posting temporarily and no longer than thirty (30) days from the date of the oral statement, unless a written statement as described in paragraph (1) of this section is submitted during that time. Business Associate further agrees that at the request of Physician Practice, Business Associate shall provide notice of the breach of unsecured PHI to individuals, the HHS Office for Civil Rights (OCR), and the media, on behalf of the covered entity as required by the Breach Notification Rule, but that Business Associate will not otherwise provide such notice.

Business Associate shall use its best efforts to mitigate the deleterious effects of any use or disclosure of PHI not authorized by this Agreement. Further, in the notice provided to Physician Practice by Business Associate regarding unauthorized uses and/or disclosures of PHI, or security incidents involving ePHI, Business Associate shall describe the remedial or other actions undertaken or proposed to be undertaken regarding the unauthorized use or disclosure of PHI, or security incident involving ePHI. Finally, Business Associate agrees that it will maintain adequate documentation of all its security breach investigation and notification efforts, including documentation of the reasons for any delay in notification.

2.12 **Affiliates, Agents, Subsidiaries and Sub-Business Associates.** Business Associate shall require that any agents, affiliates, subsidiaries and sub-Business Associates to whom it provides PHI received from Physician Practice, or PHI which was created, maintained or received by Business Associate on behalf of Physician Practice, agree in writing to the same use, disclosure, and security obligations and restrictions imposed on Business Associate by this Agreement. To the extent that Business Associate enters into any agreement with a sub-Business Associate, Business Associate agrees to ensure that any sub-Business Associates that create, receive, maintain, or transmit PHI on behalf of the business associate agree to the same restrictions, conditions, and requirements that apply to the business associate with respect to such information, in accordance with 45 CFR 164.502(e)(1)(ii) and 164.308(b)(2) as applicable.

2.13 **Ownership of Information.** All PHI shall be deemed owned by the Physician Practice unless otherwise agreed in writing. During the term of this Agreement, Business Associate and any authorized sub-Business Associates shall have the right to use and disclose the PHI solely for the purposes of this Agreement. Business Associate and its agents shall not have the right to aggregate or de-identify the PHI unless separately agreed in writing.

## Article III. Obligations of Physician Practice

3.01 Physician Practice shall inform Business Associate of any of the following changes which affect Business Associate: changes to its Notice of Privacy Practices that affect Business Associate, new or changed authorizations, restrictions on use of PHI agreed to by the Practice; or patient opt-outs concerning fundraising or marketing solicitations.

## Article IV. Term and Termination

4.1 **Term.** This Agreement shall be for a term of one (1) year, commencing on **6/14/2023** and ending on **6/14/2024** ("Initial Term"). This Agreement shall automatically renew for successive one (1) year periods ("Renewal Term") unless one party notifies the other party of its intent not to renew within sixty (60) days prior to end of the Initial Term or any Renewal Term.

4.2 **Termination for Breach of Privacy or Security.** Physician Practice, at its sole option and without an opportunity to cure, immediately may terminate this Agreement without further liability if Physician Practice determines that Business Associate has violated a material term of this Agreement related to the privacy or security of the PHI.

4.3 **Termination without Cause.** Either party to this Agreement may terminate the Agreement upon provision of sixty (60) days prior written notice.

4.4 **Termination for Cause.**
Either party may terminate this agreement for a material breach after thirty (30) days written notice of the breach and an opportunity to cure during the 30-day period.

Either party may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice if the other has a receiver or trustee appointed for any or all of its property, becomes insolvent or otherwise is unable to pay its debts as they mature, makes an assignment for benefit of creditors, becomes subject to bankruptcy proceedings or is dissolved or liquidated.

4.5 **Effects of Termination; Disposal of PHI.** Upon termination of this Agreement, Business Associate shall recover all PHI related to this Agreement that is in the possession of Business Associate's agents, affiliates, subsidiaries or sub-Business Associates. Business Associate shall, as directed by Physician Practice, either return to Physician Practice, transfer or destroy all PHI that Business Associate created, obtained or maintained pursuant to this Agreement on behalf of Physician Practice. If the parties agree at that time that the return, transfer or destruction of PHI is not feasible, such as to the extent Business Associate needs to retain the PHI for its own management and administration or to carry out its legal responsibilities, Business Associate shall extend the protections provided under this Agreement to such PHI, and limit further use or disclosure of the PHI to those purposes that make the return or destruction of the PHI infeasible. Business Associate further agrees to return or destroy the retained PHI as soon as it is feasible. If the parties agree at the time of termination of this Agreement that it is similarly infeasible for the Business Associate to recover all related PHI in the possession of Business Associate's agents, affiliates, subsidiaries or sub-Business Associates, Business Associate shall provide written notice to Physician Practice regarding the nature of the unfeasibility and Business Associate shall require that its agents, affiliates, subsidiaries and sub-Business Associates agree to the extension of all protections, limitations and restrictions required of Business Associate hereunder. Business Associate's obligations under this section shall survive the termination of this agreement.

4.6 **Mitigating Effects of Termination.** In the event of termination of this Agreement, the parties agree to work together to effectuate a smooth transition for both parties and continuous protection of the PHI disclosed to or maintained by Business Associate.

## Article V. Insurance and Indemnification

5.1 **Insurance.** Business Associate shall maintain general liability insurance to cover the risks related to this Agreement and shall, upon request, provide a copy of such policy to the Physician Practice.

5.2 **Indemnification.** Each party will indemnify and hold harmless the other party to this Agreement from and against all claims, losses, liabilities, costs and other expenses incurred as a result of, or arising directly or indirectly out of or in conjunction with:
Any misrepresentation, breach of warranty or non-fulfillment of any undertaking on the part of the party under this Agreement; and any claims, demands, awards, judgments, actions and proceedings made by any person or organization arising out of or in any way connected with the party's performance under this Agreement.

5.3 **Breach Investigation and Notification.** Business Associate further agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Physician Practice from and against any and all claims, losses, liabilities, costs and other expenses arising out of a breach of unsecured PHI maintained, stored, accessed, transmitted or used by Business Associate or any of Business Associate's sub-Business Associates. At the request of the Physician Practice, Business Associate further agrees to carry out the notification to affected individuals and to the media as required by state and federal law, and to bear the burden of demonstrating that all notifications were made as required by law.
