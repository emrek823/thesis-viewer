### Company Overview & Background

- Prognosis - been going through fundraise for a few months
- Right number of kits in right location at right time in simple, accessible and reliable way
- Jake’s background:
	- Started as consultant at competitor (tech-enabled service)
	- Worked with top 50 companies in market (like Sanofi)
	- 7-10 day turnaround for forecasting results
	- Realized 6,000 pharma companies in US, only 50 doing forecasting
	- 5,950 companies still running clinical trials via Excel spreadsheets
- Current state: “We are a glorified calculator”
	- Take in protocol, pharmacy manual, and recruitment forecast
	- Show demand forecasting: “this is your demand in the future”
	- Specify kit locations and production timing
	- Only company doing drug substance and drug product planning

### Product Vision & Roadmap

- By February 1st: caught up to speed with all competition
- AI co-pilot for clinical supplies evolution:
	- Regulatory recommendations - batch records, customs reports
		- Currently all manually processed
		- CDMOs like Almac take 6 weeks just for answers
	- Short-term demand planning using IRT data
		- Take IRT snapshots, recommend next 1-3 weeks
		- Already in discussions with multiple IRTs
	- Commercial planning module for small companies without SAP budget
- Original vision: give recommendations on trial design for given study
	- Example: oncology study recruitment typically delayed 2 months
	- Proactive scenario planning vs reactive approach
	- “We’re in the business of decision making and people forget that”
- Competitive advantages:
	- Barrier to entry: must understand clinical trials AND supply chain terminology
	- Relationship-based sales - “people only buy from people they trust”
	- Bluefin Clinical tried to merge after 6 months due to Jake’s relationships

- Goal: hit $1M by end of 2026 and be profitable from there
- Current constraints:
