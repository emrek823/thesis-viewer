### Current Status and Platform Architecture

- Converted pilots to contracts - now live with 3 multi-specialty clinics:
	- Bay Area: Gastroenterology focused
	- Northwest: Gastroenterology + Cardiology
	- Atlanta: Cardiology primarily
- Platform is modular covering entire referral lifecycle
	- Automation layer: referral comes in to appointment gets scheduled
	- Intelligence layer: differentiation beyond basic automation
	- Core thesis: AI should provide intelligence and optimization, not just automation
- Intelligence workflow example (cardiology):
	- 65-year-old patient with chest pain and shortness of breath
	- System flags clinical urgency for non-clinically trained staff
	- Routes to appropriate provider based on acuity vs availability
	- Optimizes utilization across nurse practitioners vs cardiologists
- Poor infrastructure challenges addressed:
	- EMRs like Epic have siloed data that doesn’t flow between modules
	- System acts as single source of truth for all clinic information
	- Replaces fax systems as origin point to maintain full context

### Performance Metrics and Results

- Target KPIs showing strong early results:
	- Time spent on processing referral documents and faxes reduced by 75%
	- Time between referral receipt to scheduled appointment: reduced from 1 week to 2 days
	- Goal to bring scheduling down to hours as system matures
- Revenue optimization focus:
	- Ancillary services identification (flagging needed echos before appointment)
	- Provider utilization optimization
- Retrospective study validation:
	- Used July/August/September data to predict October scheduling
	- Compared predictions against actual October schedule
	- Showed significant untapped availability and revenue opportunities
	- Three unused provider days could accommodate more echoes and recalls

### Fundraising and Next Steps

- Previous funding: $250k with Leeor
- Actively mapping next customer acquisition strategy
- Planning capital allocation for growth
- Meeting with Ryan (Stanford connection) scheduled for next week
	- Chamber Health MSO discussion - larger scale value proposition
- Follow-up planned after Ryan meeting to discuss progress
