### Common Spirit Health System & Venture Fund Overview

- $42B revenue, 25 states, largest non-profit health system
- Anuradhika leads venture arm with $250M allocation
	- Previously opportunistic investing, now structured VC approach
	- Background: recovering R&D pharmacist, decade running academic centers
- Investment thesis: anything healthcare except early drug development/devices
	- Seed stage: $500K-$1M checks as strategic partner
	- Series A-C: $5M-$35M depending on round size
- Current portfolio: ~20 companies across behavioral health, AI, pharmacy
	- Notable investments: Army (behavioral health), CapRx (transparent PBM), Torta

### Strategic Investment Approach & Requirements

- Only invests in companies where Common Spirit becomes customer
	- Must contribute to ARR from day one
	- Provides best diligence - “if we can’t buy it in 150K system, tells you something”
- Co-development model for pre-seed/seed companies
	- Access to 42M annual patients of data
	- Lab environment for founders to build/test products
	- Takes equity position as strategic partner
- Focus areas for next 18 months:
	- Automation and AI for efficiency/cost savings
	- Administrative AI over clinical AI (easier adoption)
	- Pharmacy enablers and life science tools

### Home Health Opportunity & Dart Interest

- Home health operations span 16 states, 50 MSAs serving other systems
- Unlike inpatient/ambulatory (tied to Epic), home health more open to innovation
	- HomeCare HomeBase doesn’t “promise the world” like Epic
	- Team hungry for workflow improvements
- Quality assurance use case priorities:
	- End-to-end workflow efficiency (not just coding/scribing)
	- In-home patient assessment tools
	- Streamlined intake, follow-up, documentation
- Dart evaluation criteria for Viraj to address:
	- Validation of working with large enterprise customers (comparable scale)
	- Speed/nimbleness vs internal AI team competition
	- ROI demonstration and customization capabilities

### Next Steps

- Viraj to prepare materials addressing enterprise validation and customization speed
- Demo should cover in-home patient workflow (similar to Roger Health demo excitement)
- Anuradhika to arrange call with CEO, CNO, and IT head for home health
- Follow-up discussion on potential strategic investment alignment after operational assessment
