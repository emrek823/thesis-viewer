### Josh’s Background & Previous Ventures

- Civil engineering background - won virtual bridge building competitions
- Built sneaker bot platform that scaled to 10,000 users
- Crypto experience - built escrow systems and zero-knowledge proofs during first 2 years of CS and math at University of Miami
	- Left crypto due to counterintuitive direction - FTX and Coinbase centralized systems went against thesis
- Healthcare transition via Advent Health internship in remote patient monitoring + AI
	- Discovered preference for product over development
	- Recognized innovation opportunities in healthcare
- Previous startups:
	- Left due to co-founder performance issues affecting deliverables and reputation

### Docussist - Clinical Copilot Platform

- Problem identification through Tim (Head of Revenue Cycle at Advent Health):
	- Healthcare is $4 trillion industry with 25%+ spending on revenue cycle
	- Current solutions are carbon copies targeting post-appointment claim submission
	- No products guide physicians during patient appointments for optimal care + reimbursement
	- 30% of denials caused by physicians prescribing wrong medications based on patient insurance
- Solution: First clinical copilot combining clinical decision support (CDS) and payer policy guidance
	- Ambient scribe built-in (not core focus - looking to partner with existing scribes or adapt to hospital systems)
	- Real-time guidance using UpToDate’s raw clinical decision support pathways (first company with access)
	- Inferred mode - listens to appointment and opens relevant pathways (e.g., cough → cold vs lung cancer differential)
	- Insurance-based medication recommendations to prevent denials
	- Automatic real-time coding and clinical note submission to EHR
- Technical architecture:
	- RAG engine built by Ethan (described as “one of the best RAG engineers in the world”)
	- Graph-RAG implementation (proprietary approach for unstructured UpToDate data)
	- UpToDate partnership via Warren’s Columbia executive master’s classmate
- Competitive positioning vs existing solutions:
	- Fathom: Only handles clinical coding post-appointment
	- Abridge: Building prior authorization features but doesn’t guide care
	- Open Evidence: Requires stopping appointments to look up information, lacks enterprise EHR integration

### Current Status & Growth Plans

- Team composition:
	- Josh, Ethan (engineer), Warren (former boss at Advent Health)
	- New full-stack engineer (2 weeks ago) for database and design experience
	- Long-term relationships: Warren since high school, Ethan for 2 years
- Recent traction: 3 new clinics onboarded this week
- End of January goals:
- Future enterprise strategy:
	- Leverage individual physician adoption to approach health systems (Cleveland Clinic Florida, Baylor connections)
	- Build claims processing capabilities: automatic submission, denial analysis, resubmission
	- Voice agents for insurance company communications
	- Long-term goal: Build proprietary database to replace UpToDate dependency
- Fundraising plans: Will raise after securing first major institutional client
