### Company Background

- Vihar Desu - Personal health story driving mission
	- Tested positive for APOE 4 (less than 2% population, 15x higher Alzheimer’s risk)
	- Family healthcare failures: sister misdiagnosed, dad denied preventative tests
	- Built healthcare companies outside traditional system: Doc AI (acquired), Humana Health franchise (Austin to 50 states)
- Nicholas Bernhardt-Lanier - Healthcare entrepreneur background
	- Previous experience scaling medical clinic networks
	- Focus on direct-pay, cash-based healthcare delivery

### Product: AI Rails for Direct-to-Consumer Health Spend

- Two core revenue streams:
	- Payment processing - merchant of record taking 1% processing fee
	- Workflow coordination - help clinics purchase and manage prescriptions (GLP-1s, etc.)
- Enables 50-state proxy coverage for providers without individual state licenses
- Infrastructure gap: current systems tied to insurance-based payment rails

### AI Implementation - Two Buckets

- Clinical Intelligence
	- Unstructured data processing from messy PDFs with biomarkers and metrics
	- Automated extraction of atomic facts and reference range analysis
	- Reduces time clinicians spend manually reviewing lab results
- Admin Automation
	- 150+ standardized workflows (scheduling, rescheduling, canceling)
	- Unified data layer combining communications, calendar, and API endpoints
	- Agentic AI combining API endpoints with just enough data to perform actions
	- Challenge: ensuring clinics have proper data infrastructure

### ROI Measurement

- Audit current tech stacks to establish baseline time allocation
- Directional benchmarks from multiple clinic assessments
- Example: dedicated staff member managing schedules full-time
- Calculate empirical time/cost savings through automation utilization metrics

### Go-to-Market Success

- Target: fast-growing private clinics with high tech pain points
- Current customers paying $100K+ for existing Frankenstein tech stacks
- Decision maker: business owner (private enterprise, not insurance-dependent)
- Value proposition: grow without additional headcount, not firing existing staff
- Early design partners (Lambie, Glad, Goodmed) vs full operating system overhauls

### Strategic Approach - Horizontal vs Vertical

- Vihar’s perspective: Workflows automatable and standardized across all clinics
	- Everyone needs payments, scheduling, same core problems
	- Speed of software development now enables horizontal play previously impossible
	- Vertical approach fails because clinical intelligence requires full data integration
- Market validation: Clinics approached by both vertical and horizontal solutions
	- EMRs only serve 40% of business tech stack
	- Vertical solutions connect to EMR but not to other vertical tools
	- Fundamental integration problem driving clinic frustration

### Distribution Strategy - Networks of Clinics

- Private equity consolidating clinic networks (huge distribution opportunity)
- MDVIP: 1,300+ clinics using LinkedIn scrapers, 10+ new clinics weekly
- Target enterprise partnerships with clinic networks and PE firms
- Multi-tenancy capability: data visibility per clinic and per patient at MSO level

### Fundraising Status

- Raising $6M Series A
- Angel round: $641K led by XGP at Thrive Capital
- Multiple term sheets received, verbal commitment for next day
- Timeline: close by next week (Thanksgiving complicating)
- Seeking healthcare-focused, East Coast investor (not SF-based)
- Team includes head of operations from Tempest, head of Applied AI from Tempest
- Priority: long-term partnership over valuation optimization

### Next Steps

- Virtue to debrief internally and respond ASAP
- Emre has Nicholas’s contact information for follow-up
