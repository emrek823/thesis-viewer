### Tempus Partnership Update

- Chief of Staff reviewing proposal after back-and-forth negotiations
- Sliding scale pricing: $4M if no IP/model weights retained, 50% discount if Standard Model gets model weights
- Unusual request: Tempus seeking genomics foundation model partners despite this being their strongest area
- Early validation that multimodal foundation model leaders outsourcing key capabilities

### Sanofi Progress

- Initial meetings proceeding despite unsigned contract
- Champion Galen reports positive feedback across organization
- POC timeline and budget:
	- $360K POC expected Monday (or within one week)
	- $4.8M full contract anticipated March/April 2026
	- Budget approved, BD drafting proposals
- Additional opportunities:
	- Galen’s wife (Novartis Chief Commercial Data Officer) wants pilot between Thanksgiving and Christmas
	- Academic capacity work progressing to official partnership

### Technical Platform Development

- Genomics capabilities expanding rapidly:
	- Started with breast cancer, now moving pan-cancer
	- Two of David Laub’s colleagues joining (one working 30 hours/week for free)
	- New tech stack testing at MSK shows best performance to date
- Academic partnerships accelerating:
	- MD Anderson now public (logo permission pending)
	- Multiple Yale collaborations
	- UC San Diego providing 700K EHRs plus images
	- AstraZeneca at NDA stage with weekly meetings

### Market Validation Insights

- Customer categories:
	- Immediate understanding (IQVIA, Tempus, Sanofi, AstraZeneca): grasp concept in 1-2 sentences
	- Education required: need 20+ minutes explaining foundation models in drug development
- Key competitive concerns emerging:
	- IQVIA wants to sell foundation models themselves, questioning business model conflicts
	- Dandelion Health sees potential competition (reduced data purchases if customers fine-tune models)
	- Real-world data companies recognizing threat to their business models

### Fundraising Strategy Discussion

- Current runway: 12 months at current burn rate with $360K POC
- Preferred timeline: close Sanofi before Series A (March/April 2026)
- Risk mitigation: cannot pressure Galen without damaging relationship
- Alternative timeline: begin fundraising January/February if Sanofi delays further
- Key concern: competitor raising $200M+ round could steamroll data access advantage

### Next Steps

- Kevin to write 1-2 page manifesto outlining:
	- Core beliefs about foundation models in biomedicine
	- Why pharma cannot build internally (bureaucracy, data limitations)
	- Standard Model’s unique positioning and approach
- Schedule follow-up before Thanksgiving to discuss investor outreach strategy
- Begin informal conversations with top-tier VCs (Dimension, Andreessen) before formal fundraise
