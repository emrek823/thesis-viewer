### Fundraising Update

- Sean Vandy committed for $2M
- Optum allocation request pending: $12.5-15M range
	- Meeting with IC yesterday
	- Decision expected by end of Thanksgiving
- CVS decision by December 5th
- Between these commitments, decent sense of round completion

### Venture Market Insights on Roll-ups

- Three categories of VC feedback on roll-up businesses:
	- Honesty about lack of execution
		- Many say they’re doing roll-ups but actually aren’t
		- A16z example: only one deal (ex-partner’s company)
		- Unrealistic expectations: 3x revenue growth in one year
	- Executing but struggling
		- Bain/Norwest: 18 months with LOIs, still no closed deals
		- MIT research scientist trying RIA roll-ups - finding it difficult
	- Self-sourcing challenges without network advantage
		- Banks won’t send deals to inexperienced teams
		- Domain expertise crucial for successful execution
- Different receptivity from private equity vs venture
	- General Atlantic quote: “How fast can I get $300M into you guys?”

### Product Execution Priorities (Next 12 Months)

- Acquire businesses at scale within 8-12x multiple range consistently
	- Target 6-8 acquisitions
	- 51% ownership structure with installment payments over 12 months
	- Cash flow accretive if structured correctly at scale
- Revenue and margin improvements needed:
	- Modest 5-10% baseline improvement
	- Achieve 30% growth and 40% margins
	- Path to 10-15M EBITDA from acquired assets
	- Platform break-even already achievable

### Strategic Partnerships & Future Capital

- Optum strategic value beyond capital:
	- Top-tier hierarchy contracts for all distribution lines
	- Lead flow partnership for non-enrolled clinic leads
- Future fundraising strategy (12-18 months):
	- Lightspeed warrant exercise: $30M
	- Additional equity: $32-50M
	- Debt component: $50M (50/50 equity/debt split)
	- Progressive shift toward higher debt ratios in subsequent rounds
- Goal: Self-finance acquisitions through internally generated capital
