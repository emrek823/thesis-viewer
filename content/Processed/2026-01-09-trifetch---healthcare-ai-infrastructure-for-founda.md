Foundation models ace medical licensing exams but miss critical diagnoses in practice. Current benchmarks reward memorization over clinical reasoning, creating a false sense of readiness that collapses in real-world deployment.

/ Process

## A Proven Path to Scientific Results

We don't follow cookie-cutter timelines. Every engagement adapts to your technical requirements and deployment constraints—but the core methodology remains rigorous.

/ 01

Discovery & Scoping

We figure out what you're actually trying to solve. —the real problem. What's failing, what constraints you're working with, and what "success" means beyond sounding good in a deck.

/ 02

Proposal & Planning

You get a plan with honest timelines and deliverables we can actually hit. For larger projects, we start with a quick validation test on a small dataset—proof of concept before full commitment.

/ 03

Testing, Analysis & Iteration

The messy middle where the work happens. We build, test, break things, fix them, and loop in experts who tell us when we're wrong. Progress over perfection, but both eventually.

/ 04

Deployment (and possibly more iteration)

You get what we agreed on: datasets that work, benchmarks that matter, or models ready to deploy. Plus documentation written for humans and support when reality inevitably differs from the plan.

## Where Technical Rigor Meets Clinical Impact

AI labs improving model performance. Healthcare organizations deploying custom solutions. Real projects, measurable outcomes, physician-validated results.

### AI x Clinical Benchmarking

A leading AI lab's foundation model was failing on medically complex cases and multi-turn conversations. We designed clinical evaluation frameworks with specialist physicians, identified performance gaps across pediatrics, oncology, and nuclear medicine, and delivered targeted datasets with human-in-the-loop feedback.

Result

35%

improvement in rubric scores across medical accuracy, and emergency referral protocols.

### TriFetch Radiology Assistant

Radiologists were overwhelmed—80% of cases showing no abnormality but requiring identical reports, while critical findings in the other 20% risked being missed. We deployed an AI assistant with PACS integration that automates first-pass report generation and highlights potential lesions.

Result

20%

faster workflow, improved diagnostic catch rates, now piloting across multiple hospital systems.
