## Abstract

Cardiac amyloidosis (CA) is a rare and underdiagnosed infiltrative cardiomyopathy, and available datasets for machine-learning models are typically small, imbalanced and heterogeneous. This paper presents a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and a graphical command-line interface for generating realistic synthetic electrocardiogram (ECG) beats to support early diagnosis and patient stratification in CA. The tool is designed for usability, allowing clinical researchers to train class-specific generators once and then interactively produce large volumes of labelled synthetic beats that preserve the distribution of minority classes.
