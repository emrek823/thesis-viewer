Summary
A chief administrative officer for a large retina specialty practice in the Bay Area shared that after struggling to maintain a call center staff of three, they decided to work with Assort Health, an AI company, to handle scheduling-based calls. Assort successfully picked up 3,400 calls in the first month, with over 1,000 being related to scheduling, resulting in a 4.3 out of five satisfaction rate and improved patient communication. The Tegus Client and the expert discussed the positive impact of Assort on patient satisfaction and call center efficiency, potential areas for further development, willingness to pay more for additional capabilities, cost-effectiveness, flexibility of the contract, and the need for ongoing evaluation of the tool's effectiveness.

noticed that Voice in particular has been an interesting application in healthcare, given there's so many calls among the various different stakeholders and parties. We specifically came across a company called Assort Health that I believe you're either evaluating or a customer of.

Wanted to get more perspective specifically on your practice, why you end up choosing Assort, and the scope of competing solutions around there. What might be helpful to start is just brief description of your background and the practice you're at and then can go from there.

Expert
Sure. I'm the chief administrative officer for a large retina specialty practice in the Bay Area. We have six locations, seven physicians.

Client
All in the Bay Area?

Expert
All in the Bay Area, yeah. We see about 45,000 appointments a year. We identified that we were getting about 10,000 phone calls a month. Because of that, we started an internal call center. When we were staffing our call center, we thought that three folks should be able to manage the majority of calls, and we could take the calls off of our front desk or at least have the majority of them redirected to our call center.

We quickly found that trying to maintain a staff of three is really difficult. It was hard for them to get all the phone calls as well too. We were thinking, do we need to expand our call center? How many more people do we need? The challenges with recruiting, training, retaining call center folks, and the cost of it.

Client
Just before we get into all the assortments, just a couple of questions on that super helpful background. You said 10,000 phone calls a month across 45,000 appointments per year. What were the majority of the phone calls from, or if you have to put them into major buckets, what would they be?

Expert
It's funny. Fast forward really quick, by working with Assort, we were able to identify that 50% or more of these calls are usually existing patients canceling, scheduling, rescheduling, or verifying their appointment. That would be the largest bucket. The remaining calls, there's a significant number of calls that are related to new patient referrals that the doctor's office is calling us to get new patients in. Another significant number, we got a lot of spam, then we also just get a lot of calls from vendors, internal calls from doctors calling from one office to the other, or external calls of doctors following up on patients that they refer to us.

Client
That's super helpful. You said you used Assort to actually segment out the calls.

Expert
Yeah. I can get into that. Let me talk a little bit more about it.

Client
Wonderful. Just on the call center, were the three people you hired based in the Bay Area, or were they overseas? What was your spend on the call center every year, all in?

Expert
Sure. We first started with local call folks, Bay Area folks, and that is the most expensive because on average, we pay about $25, $26 an hour to these folks. It almost ends up being like $5,000-$6,000 a month for each one. Once we started getting some attrition from that initial hire of three, one has remained. She's become more of a supervisor, but she's still part of the call center.

We started hiring in Columbia, South America, which is half the price. We still utilize those folks as well too because they're really good. They're $2,500 a month instead of $5,000, $6,000 a month. Now, our call center is two people from South America and two people in America.

Client
Okay. Just to make sure and clarify, you started with three folks in the Bay Area, it sounds like $15,000 a month, then you switched to hiring people from Colombia, which is half the cost. You now have two people from Colombia, two people from the U.S., and that is basically $5,000 per month for the Colombian people, and then $10,000 per month for the U.S. people?

Expert
Yeah. It's the same price, but what we realize is because we actually need more than three, if I was going to have five people, the right number was probably double that, like up to six for the volume of calls that we're dealing with now.

Client
Got it. It's the same price as before, but basically, you would have needed to expand your team in order to actually get the right volume of people. Here, you kept the same price but now can answer all the calls. That's very helpful. You said that same cost. Now, getting into the AI phone call stuff, I cut you off, but this was very helpful background. You said eight months ago.

Expert
Yeah. Basically, what happened I was first initially approached by another AI group to focus on outbound calls to insurance through AI. This group was started by a friend of mine, a founder. She was part of Y Combinator. I was really impressed at that point. Before then, I didn't think AI voice was where it needed to be. It sounded too robotic and had too many issues.

Her platform in just making these outbound calls, I was really impressed with the voice quality, the being able to build in the algorithm, get the answers that we needed. We were starting to find some success with this very small project of making outbound calls to insurance to verify eligibility. That piqued my interest in voice AI overall. I started thinking, "Okay, maybe that's the solution instead of trying to find more people for a call center."

Client
That's awesome.

Expert
Exactly. I came across Assort at an Athenahealth conference. They had been reaching out to me as I speak at Athenahealth conferences on different issues, stuff like that. They had been reaching out to me. They said they would be at the conference.

When I was there, they gave me a demo. What I liked about them was that they were already working with a couple of Athenahealth groups, specifically in orthopedics. They had a board member from Athenahealth. I was very impressed with the demo. Right away, I did a live demo of my own. I called one of the medical practices using them. I know at that time they had no retina practices, no ophthalmology practices, but I was impressed with what they had done.

The reason I was impressed was because orthopedics, retina, and specialties like ours, we do have a lot of algorithms as to when a person calls in, what types of questions need to be answered, or what types of questions are being asked, and how to manage that patient and their expectations or the person on the phone's calls. I thought maybe with some tweaking, this could work for retina because we have a lot of algorithms. If a person calls, if it is for this, then this, if it is this, then this, that kind of thing that we spend time training our staff to gain mastery when answering phone calls.

This was back in October, November. I started working with Assort Health to say, "Hey, I think we might be

interested in this because one, it seems to be working well with existing practices. Two, you guys tie into Athena really well." That was important to me as well too." Three, as I look at my call scaling on my call center and still having these issues with trying to hire more people, train them, retain them, I could pretty much bring in this AI agent and it would maybe solve for my hiring issue.

Plus, also as I scale, it could take over more phone calls and that can probably redirect some of my call center folks to other more specific roles or give them other duties that are valuable to us, but we just weren't able to get to kind of thing. That's initially how I looked at working with Assort. We signed our contract in January, and we planned for about a three-month implementation.

To me, I initially thought that was long, but I thought about it like we usually give staff 90 days for the probationary period. I was like, "You know what? that is similar to that." Plus, I also understand that this is a new specialty for them. Even though there are similarities with what they have worked with before, there's differences. I wanted to give them the best opportunity to be successful through this three-month period. That's why we identified what types of calls we're getting.

We wanted to be very specific that Assort would handle our scheduling-based calls. It helped us identify that, "Hey, this is what a majority of the calls actually end up being." It also helped us identify early on that of our 10,000 calls, about 1/3 of them were going to our front desk. That was also causing a high missed call rate as well too because our front desks were just overwhelmed with other tasks, and it's not ideal for phone calls to go to the front desk. The initial goal has been really successful.

We launched March 29th only because I was actually doing a presentation on AI and healthcare, and I wanted to have a little bit more actual experience of Assort before I talk about them. April was actual the full month. We just did our review, and Assort picked up 3,400 calls. These were 3,400 calls that came through to our Assort line through our phone tree that we created.

Basically, our phone tree has four options. The second option, which is for scheduling, that pushes the call to Assort. Of that 3,500 calls, there is like over 1,000 that were identified as truly being something related to scheduling that a majority of them actually just end up being patients wanting to verify their appointment.

Client
Like, "Hey, my appointment's at 9:00 A.M. today?"

Expert
Exactly. Even though we send them a text, we send them an email, we do a pre-appointment phone call through another appointment reminder program we have, patients still want to verify their appointment, so they call. Now, the front desk, it's funny, just the other day one of my managers was telling me that they're afraid they might not have a job because the lack of phone calls going to the front desk has been really noticed. They're not getting any at all.

It's causing them to think "Oh no, will I have any work?" I was like, "No, don't worry, there's plenty of work to go around." That also gives us the opportunity to think of helping those front desk people maybe take on some more hybrid roles instead of us hiring for more back-office staff or other patient-focused roles.

Client
Just to be a little more specific, you mentioned that 3,500 calls, 1,000 were scheduling-related, what specifically are the metrics you're measuring Assort against here?

Expert
The first one was how many calls come off the front desk. We had identified of those 10,000 calls initially, roughly around 3,000 were going to our front desk, and then another about 25% were getting missed altogether across the practice. The initial KPIs have been to remove those 3,500 phone calls or 3,000+ phone calls from the front desk, and then also reduce our missed call number as well too.

The third to that, we also wanted to see does it help improve patient satisfaction and referring physician office satisfaction because now they can actually get through on a phone call. That was important to us as

well, too. We've been able to measure patient satisfaction through Assort because it also does send a survey out. From there, they have a 4.3 out of five satisfaction rate so far.

Client
Is that good or bad?

Expert
That's good. All we knew from before were patients were really upset because they sometimes have a hard time getting through. Even if it's just to confirm an appointment, it would cause some concern that they weren't able to get through more than that. We never really were able to survey patients prior. Now, with Assort, the way we have it set up, it does send out a survey to some patients, and that's where we know that it has that rating, that satisfaction rating.

Anecdotally, we've heard from our referring offices that they are a lot happier. They noticed the difference that now they're able to actually get through when they make a phone call. In this month alone, the first month alone, I'd say that I've been very impressed with what the metric's been able to achieve. It's opened up our thoughts like, "Hey, on what else we can work with Assort on evolving this Voice AI tool into doing."

Client
Awesome. What's your contract? How much are you paying?

Expert
We pay a few thousand dollars per month.

Client
Awesome. I'm curious, let's just say one of the people from your call center leaves for whatever reason you mentioned, it's hard to recruit and maintain them. Do you think you would try to hire another person, or do you think Assort can fill that gap?

Expert
We feel Assort can fill that gap. Actually, one of our current call center people, she wants to move to a different role. Now that we have Assort, and we see that it has picked up the slack and can pick up her slack, we feel more confident that we can give her that opportunity. I won't have to hire someone to replace her.

Client
You said there are seven physicians?

Expert
Yeah.

Client
Cool. You don't have to hire people to replace. Two questions actually. Are there other areas you think Assort can help? I'm not suggesting they're going to do this, but like you mentioned, your friend is doing insurance phone calls. Are there other areas that you imagine they could start to go into or that you want them to go into?

Expert
Yeah. I would say the two areas. One is new patient referrals because right now, we have those calls directed to a live person, but there really probably is not a reason to direct it to a live person, seeing how Assort can handle the call that it currently handles, but my one thing with around new patient referrals is more of a preference and understanding.

There are so many different tools out there and our staff have to have multiple windows open for different

programs. If Assort is going to head into this direction of also managing new patient referrals, my recommendation to them is just don't manage the phone call part. Take responsibility of the whole new patient referral thing which includes faxes and web forms now.

I have already suggested to them and been talking to them about saying, "Hey, you guys might want to consider developing a full-fledged CRM system around new patient referrals because we not only get them from phone calls, but we also get them from these other sources. It would help a practice a lot to be able to have one place to manage all of these and track them too, which doesn't really happen in medical practices."

I use a tool that helps us track our web-based referrals. Ideally, it would be good to have one platform that could manage all of that together and then give oversight to a practice of, "Hey, these are the referrals coming into your fax" and then feedback to the referring office like, "Oh, okay, your appointment has been scheduled," maybe a text to that patient saying that you have an appointment now with so and so on this date, that kind of thing.

I think AI can play a significant role in that. I think Assort would be great to segue into that as well too or offer that as an offering. The other area around eligibility, there are again phone calls this need to be made. There are some insurances that only require that. I am looking at AI tools that can crawl EMRs and bots that can crawl the EMR and then enter data into portals from insurances where majority of eligibility checks and authorizations are gotten from.

If Assort is going to go into that, again I would say the real value add bang for the buck. I think selling point would be if you have a whole platform that can manage that from all perspectives. Just to do the phone calls part is great, it helps, but there are other offerings out there. It would be nice to have everything under one roof, but if I am going to have everything under one roof, what would be nicer is that it has full-fledged capabilities around those areas.

Client
Awesome. Would you pay more for all those capabilities? I'm curious.

Expert
Yeah, basically. When I talk to AI, I talk to a couple of AI groups being in Silicon Valley, I get a lot of these phone calls. My thing with them is like if you want to sell to physicians, you can't be like, "Oh, we're going to be the same price." They're going to have to be cheaper than what we're currently paying. That doesn't necessarily mean free.

An example I give is in our case, say our call center costs $15,000 a month currently, and this is what it achieves, if you come in and say, "Hey, for looking at what you guys want to achieve, it's going to cost you $25,000 if you have to hire two more people, but we can come in for a few thousand dollars, hire the price of one more person and allow you to achieve what you want to achieve but would cost you $25,000, but it's going to cost you less working with us to do it." That's like, "Okay, you know what? Sure." If I have to spend the money on hiring a person or the money on this thing, I can try this thing out and see if it works. If it doesn't work, it's a lot easier to fire AI than it is a person.

Right now, we're in a three-month testing period. After that, they do want a three-year contract, but I think it's also important at that time to also negotiate that "Okay, the contract, good or bad, if things are doing better than what we expect or we're building out more products, sure, we can renegotiate it, but if it's not working up or for whatever reason, if the magic disappears or something happens or there's some regulation that keeps us from being able to use it, then we need to be able to exit." It's like a risk on both sides, but that's what we do running a business.

Client
