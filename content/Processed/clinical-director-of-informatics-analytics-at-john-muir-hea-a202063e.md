### Client
Hi, thank you for taking the time to speak with me. For context, I’m doing a market research about ambient scribe. I would like to understand a little bit about your background and experience first, the area that you work in, your day-to-day responsibilities, then I would be interested in talking about the tool that you use called Ambience and then we would shift our focus to a little bit of E&#x26;M processes and different medical coding processes. Can you please briefly introduce yourself, describe your role and responsibilities?

### Expert
I'm a family nurse practitioner. I practice per diem in urgent care and I'm the clinical director of informatics and analytics in our health system. We have two acute care hospitals, one behavioral health hospital and about 80 outpatient clinics. Overall on the outpatient side we have four medical groups and there's around almost 500 clinicians that work there. On the inpatient side we have a bunch of hospitalists as well as consulting physicians that are partnered with us to deliver care.

Day-to-day roles, managing informatics team. We do a lot of different projects and evaluation of tools that may be helpful or not helpful to end users and to the health system. Our team supports physicians, nurses, physical therapy, pharmacy, all of the different teams that utilize Epic. Our role is primarily supporting Epic and the different software systems that surround Epic and in delivering care.

## Conversation Transcript

**Client:** Is Epic the major EHR across all of these places like the outpatient setting, inpatient setting?
**Expert:** Correct.

**Client:** In terms of the different tools that you mentioned, is there just Ambience that is being used at the moment for documenting patient encounter and documentation or do you have more tools like that?
**Expert:** We utilize Dragon as well.

**Client:** Is Dragon more for dictation or do you also use the Dragon copilot which has similar functionality?
**Expert:** We just use the Dragon dictation and then we have Ambience. A lot of clinicians still use both if they were a Dragon user prior to getting Ambience, and that's because they utilize Dragon to dictate when they're reviewing results if they're writing a message, patient message or a staff message. You can use the dictation in anywhere within the chart but Ambience is more so just for that clinical documentation.

**Client:** Got it. How long has it been since you introduced Ambience to the team? Has it been one year?
**Expert:** It's been more than that. We started utilizing and piloting it in July of 2023, and then we had built a custom integration with Ambience so that it was integrated into the EHR in November of 2023.

**Client:** That's pretty long. How has the experience been so far? What is the feedback that you've been getting from the providers? I'm guessing that the physicians are directly using it or are there more roles that are using the product?
**Expert:** Our NPs and PAs are also using it. We are rolling out a pilot to other ancillary departments as well. The inpatient hospitalists, some of them are using it. We tried it in the ED, but we don't have a strong champion in the ED, so that pilot failed for us. The feedback has been really great for the people who ended up adopting it and for the people who are giving it a chance.

I think there are subsets of providers where they're already pretty efficient with their notes. They have templates, and when they see their patients, it's much more so a quick consultation because they just saw the patient 30, 60 days ago, and there's no changes in their medical history or anything like that. It's just maintenance, checking that their medications work or something like that.

A lot of providers have templates or they will pull in that past note for those very stable patients. For those types of patients, it's not great. For your new patients and patients who have a really extensive history, it's great. If you're just seeing that patient for that one time, for example, under urgent care, it's really helpful. We have pretty good uptake in our primary care clinics as well.

We have a few urologists and a bunch of our specialists are on it and the people who use it love it. There's those people who are holding out and they just don't like trying new things and it's really hard to get them to change if they have to change their workflows. Generally, once they try it and they are saving time and they're seeing that they're saving time, then they're more likely to continue using it.

## Client
You mentioned that it wasn't that successful in the beginning. Can you talk a little bit about that?

## Expert
When we initially started to pilot in the ED in December 2023 and early January 2024, we have a provider champion that we generally work with in the ED, and he said that it was helpful for that initial visit initially. With the ED, your interaction with the patient is very short and iterative. You'll see the patient for five minutes initially for their history and whatnot.

You'll run some test labs or whatever, you'll come back, talk to them for a minute. It's little interactions like that throughout the time frame that the patient is in the ED. It's very hard to file your note after that first five minutes because the course of the patient is still changing throughout that encounter.

You can't go in and re-record and have the AI re-summarize or change what it had said before because essentially after you see that patient for the first five minutes, you do have to put in a note into the system and then that note may change, but then the AI is not going to be able to reiterate remembering what was said in that previous five-minute encounter to recalculate essentially and regenerate a note, because you still have to put in that note in that first five minutes so that other people know what you're doing too.

It's not just for you. That iterative function over that course of the ED visit is really hard to do when you're seeing the patient a minute here and there and you're trying to get it to update and capture. We haven't quite found the right workflow to work in. It's interesting for us, we haven't been able to, but Memorial Herman in Texas, their most successful area is the ED in utilizing this tool. I think it might be health system to health system what the workflow is.

## Client
Got it. What was your process when it came to selecting the tool Ambience? What factors influenced you with your decision to choose Ambience over other players in the market?

## Expert                                          Sean Doolan

At the time, because we were quite early        sd@virtuevc.com
on, there weren't any vendors that were integrated with Epic yet. We knew that DAX and Abridge were the preferred vendors for Epic, but they didn't have a timeline as to when that would happen. Prior to Ambience coming on board in 2023, we had been slowly looking at these tools. We had looked at Suki and Augmedix and DAX.

In those conversations in 2021-2023, it didn't seem like the technology was there yet. The note that was generated wasn't great or there was a delay in terms of when the note would generate. I think previously, DAX's turnaround time was like four hours because the note would still generate, but then it would go to a human to review the note before they send it back into the system.

We thought that that wasn't acceptable, so we didn't go with DAX at the time. With Abridge, we didn't evaluate them when we were evaluating Ambience. We were just blown away by the note that Ambience had generated during a few demos and the pilot that we had because it picked up multiple people's voices and it was able to discern who was talking.

For example, we had played around in a scenario where it was a patient, their parent, the sibling in the room, the physician in the room, and then people knocking on the door and interrupting your visit because that's like the normal visit. Other vendors, during the demo, they basically only allowed their salespeople to play the patient and the clinician.

It was very scripted and we were like, "No, that's not like a real clinical scenario. You have to account for noises and all these other things and multiple people in the room." It was able to take out the non-pertinent information, like the small talk that you have with the patient.

What was really amazing was that it was able to prioritize the problem that the patient was there for. If you're talking to the patient for CHF, but then you're also talking to them about their blood pressure and whatnot, it takes into consideration your specialty and then it'll prioritize that CHF over the other things that

## Conversation Transcript

### Client
How would you rate your note accuracy that you gathered from Ambience compared to all the other tools?
From a scale of 1-10, how would you rate the entire note accuracy that came out after the conversations with the patients and the multiple speakers coming in, what were the notes like? How were they?

### Expert
Yes, so at that time, it was probably around 95% accurate. Sometimes, during that time frame, there would be little things that it thought that it heard. For example, if the microphone or something was in your pocket or there's some shuffling around, it'll make things up because it thought it heard something. I think after that had happened a few times early in 2023 and early 2024, they had built in a hallucination detection. Now, my note is 99.9% done, and I just spend five seconds reviewing it to make sure that it's not saying anything crazy that it captured. I rarely have to make edits to that generated part.

### Client
Got it. That's interesting. What additional features of Ambience were particularly attractive or valuable to you and your organization?

### Expert
We also have the suggested diagnoses where when the AI is listening in on the conversation and you're talking to them about other disease states, medications, and whatnot, it'll suggest those other diagnoses to you as well to add, because adding that will add the supporting documentation as well, it'll justify you coding a higher level of service if there is that justification.

If you're a urologist and you're seeing the patient for their prostate issues, but you also talk to them about their blood pressure and their rash or something like that, it'll suggest those other two diagnoses for you and also add in the supporting documentation. Previously, the urologist would only code for the urology issue that they're seeing the patient for, even though they might have talked about their other conditions but with Ambience, it's made it so easy to add in those other diagnoses that people will do that now.

### Client
Got it. Prior to Ambience, what was the typical route? Were providers informed about any suggested codes by, let's say, the medical coders or the nurse practitioners before the encounter in any way or form?

### Expert
No. We did have coders on the back end reviewing things, and they would use an NLP solution because we partner with Optum, and Optum does our coding. Sometimes they'll come back with coding updates. They'll only do that for those Medicare visits where they'll say, "It looks like the patient's hemoglobin A1C is higher than X. Is it justifiable to add diabetes to their diagnosis list?" They'll do stuff like that, but only for those Medicare visits. They don't really suggest adding diagnoses. They might suggest that you change your level of service code, but they don't really suggest adding diagnoses.

### Client
Got it. Is it right to say that Ambience today with these suggestive codes is helping the providers with prospective coding process like telling the provider what are the codes that they need to address before the encounter happens, or do they review it only after the note is generated?

### Expert
It's only after the note is generated. It's basically like listening in on the conversation and then recommending the code, the diagnosis that you have discussed during that visit. Ambience does have a diagnosis problem list feed from us as well. One of the issues that we had early on was that it did not have access to the patient's problem list. It would suggest these diagnoses to add that weren't specified enough or weren't off of the patient's problem list. It was creating duplicative work because you would add.

something to problem list, but it would not make it down to the visit diagnosis because the Ambience generated one did not match the problem list one.

We've updated the integration sometime I think last year, where Ambience is able to also access our problem list and our diagnoses. It will actually suggest a code that the patient already has on their problem list if it is there. The other thing that we also have is the BVI, like the coding functionality of it, where it suggests a level of service code as well. What we've heard from that is that it actually helps providers become better coders in real time because it'll give you suggestions and it'll tell you why.

The justification for those level of service codes compared to if you were getting a coding query from a coder way after the visit. They don't necessarily explain exactly why this code should have been a different code. You are not really able to learn over time as to why this note should be a different code, but with it happening in real time, we are all learning to become better coders. We were never taught to be coders. We were just told to do it after working in the healthcare system. That has been really nice. It is like real time feedback essentially.

**Client**
Got it. What happens after the note is generated with all the codes? Is it signed off by the provider and sent directly to CMS or does that get reviewed by another set of coders before being sent?

**Expert**
It gets reviewed by another set of coders. What we've seen is that there's been a lower instance of asking providers to change their codes with the people who utilize Ambience and its coding suggestions compared to the people who don't use it.

**Client**
Makes sense. I had a similar question here. Apart from the one that you just mentioned, how are you measuring the return on investment with Ambience? What are the different KPIs that help you measure the outcome of shifting to Ambience?

**Sean Doolan**
DO NOT COPY

**Expert**
It's around cognitive load, like do people like it or not? What we've seen is there's been an increase. The level of service codes have changed from level threes to level fours. There's been an incremental increase in each visit level service code. We've been able to justify the cost of it just through that level of service code changing from level three to level four.

**Client**
Got it. What is the typical price point that Ambience offers this service at?

**Expert**
We have an enterprise license which is like all you can eat buffet essentially. Anyone on our outpatient side can have access to it and we moved away from the, I think prior because before the enterprise license of like all you can use. It was on a per user basis but we've moved away from that.

**Client**
Got it. Do you have a ballpark number of what the price is? Let's say is it bulk member price?

**Expert**
It's like a bulk. Basically what had happened was when it was on a per user per license, there would be people who won't utilize it enough to justify the cost of it so then we would have to keep track of that and ask those users, "Hey, if you're not going to use it, we're going to recycle your license to somebody else." That was really hard to keep track of for us.

There was also the providers who would go out on leave or they would take a two-week vacation or

**Client**
Got it. That makes sense to have access to it at bulk and giving it out to providers based on their usage. Is there anything else that you would like to tell me about Ambience? Maybe areas that Ambience could improve upon? Is there any scope for improvement for that tool?

**Expert**
I think they could do more work and development on the ancillary side. Your physicians aren't the only ones who document. You have case managers who also document. You have physical therapists and occupational therapists and other areas that document as well, including nursing.

The other area is, if the note that is generated now can also help you meet specific quality measures where it files into discrete documentation for specific fields that feed into your quality reporting. For example, CMS requires health systems to ask about social drivers of health, like financial literacy, transportation needs, do they need help paying people's bills? And that right now is manual documentation. You have to go and document in these discrete forms to be able to report out on that.

If it's just written free text in a note, it's not going to be captured in the data that we need to report out. If Ambience or any of the companies are able to take that discrete documentation, put it into those fields or the forms that is required to report out on, that would be game changer because you're going to need that to meet quality measures, your regulatory measures, your Joint Commission stuff like Magnet certification and all that. You need discrete documentation and putting things into a note is not suffice. You can't report out on it.

**Client**
Got it. What about Evaluation and Management service coding, do you feel that Ambience have a scope to target that space too?

**Sean Doolan**
DO NOT COPY
sd@virtuevc.com

**Expert**
They already do. That's what I meant by the level of service codes. It'll recommend a level of service code for you based on the conversation and the visit.

**Client**
Is there any scope for improvement in that or does that workflow work well today?

**Expert**
If it also started recommending procedure codes. For example, if it's listening on the conversation and note that you are doing an ear lavage, if it starts dropping those codes too. Not just the E&#x26;M level of service code, but the actual CPT procedure code.

**Client**
Got it. I want to understand a little bit about the E&#x26;M coding processes today practiced at your organization. Who is responsible for performing that coding in your health system?

**Expert**
The physicians are responsible for dropping the codes.

**Client**
Is there a separate team that would also be reviewing the codes being dropped? Is there a separate coding team? Can you tell me a little bit about the roles and responsibilities of those teams? When do they come in? Maybe an end-to-end workflow with an example would help.

# Expert Interview Transcript

## Expert
Yes. When the providers drop the code and they close their visit, it goes over to the coding team and the coding team has a software system that they utilize to review the notes. That software system, basically my understanding is that it essentially flags it for review. If it needs to be reviewed, then a human coder will review it along with the generation of suggestions that it has, because they utilize the proprietary software through Optum to do that. They'll send a coding query to the physician or the clinician asking them to update the code or to add in diagnoses and then the other ones that aren't flagged, the bills just go out to the insurance companies.

## Client
Got it. Is that process called risk prospective coding? That was just like a term that I had come across. Is that term actively used in healthcare systems too?

## Expert
That is primarily utilized for Medicare wellness visits, where essentially we have a form that shows up to the provider with diagnoses and suspected conditions that has been coded on prior to the visit, where the insurance company has access to prior claims data and prior diagnoses that the patient has had. During that Medicare annual wellness visit, you have to code for those diagnoses once a year.

If it hadn't been coded on yet, then it'll come up as a suspected condition but that's not something that Ambience does. It's a different tool because it requires claims data and labs data where it could start generating those types of things. Ambience basically just works on what's happening within the visit. It's able to have some context information from the patient's chart, but it doesn't have access to the claims data that the insurance companies have to produce the suspected conditions within a specific form.

## Client
Got it. I think in the end, if we happen to have some time left, I would be really interested to learn about that process too, but in the meantime, I'll continue with my E&#x26;M coding questions. Are there any specific guidelines provided to the providers or the billing staff on how to select the most appropriate codes? Is there something being given out to them by your team or by the payers? Any specific guidelines?

## Expert
There are webinars that we're supposed to attend to learn how to code better, but it's very general. They'll say things like "If the patient has diabetes and retinopathy, you should always code with diabetic retinopathy or something like that. If the patient is on insulin, you should always code with long-term use of insulin. You code at the highest level of specificity."

We learn that but when you're in the throes of trying to chart and if you order a lab in the system and you reorder a lab that the patient has already had in the past, it's going to be already linked to a diagnosis that it was ordered with in the past. You're not going to go and take the extra time and clicks to change that diagnosis.

In real time, you don't get any suggestions or any reminders that you should be coding differently. People, even if they do, they'll just bypass it because they're just trying to get through their day. We get webinars and stuff like that that will tell us. If it's not in real time and the system is not automatically doing it for people, they're less likely to do it. Providers get so annoyed when it's a human coder asking them to do something.

## Client
When it comes to the coding system, do you have a primary coding system you primarily use? Is it catering towards CPT codes? Is there something specific towards one type of codes?

## Expert

You have to use E&#x26;M codes. You do use CPT codes. There's just different codes for different things. We have a screen that's called charge capture where it has quick buttons for your most utilized codes that are specific for your specialty. Those are quite easy to select but the naming convention of the codes are not great. That's why I was saying if Ambience is able to serve up those CPT codes and those procedure codes like it does for the E&#x26;M level of service codes and we just have to review it and add it, that would be amazing.

Right now, if I work in urgent care and I do an abscess, incision and drainage, I have to add the level of service code then I have to go and add the CPT code for incision and drainage, and then I'll have to go and add the CPT code for the medication, the lidocaine that I utilized.

**Client**
Is there an algorithm or a key factor for calculating these billing codes based on the duration of the visit, complexity of visit, type of visit, diagnosis discussed? Is there an algorithm that's defined? How is that defined?

**Expert**
It's all defined by CMS. It goes by medical decision making or the time of the visit. Generally, medical decision making is the primary one where people code for but there are instances where, for example, if you're doing a procedure, even though it's an abscess and it's an incision and drainage, that's pretty if the medical decision making on that is low, but the time that you are taking to perform the procedure and to evaluate for drug to drug interactions and all that stuff, it might take some time for that. You might code at the higher level of service for the time compared to for your medical decision making because it's a relatively easy diagnosis to manage.

**Client**
Got it. Now, coming to the coder part, I have a couple of questions around the coding workflow. I was just shifting gears and I was also curious a little bit about the coding tools that you mentioned. You had mentioned that there's a coding team that uses Optum solutions. Would you be interested to talk a little bit about that? If yes, then I have a couple of questions there too.

**Expert**
The Optum tool, it's through Clinovations. Clinovations is like one of Optum's arms that provides this risk adjustment, risk gap tool. What they do is they run claims data and all these other data sources outside of the system and then they have an integration that pulls in the suspected conditions based on prior claims data or lab data, and then it'll serve that up in a form for you to add to your visit diagnoses. You're supposed to document some notes on that to the assessment and plan on those. You're supposed to put whether it's stable or it's not stable and what medications and stuff like that they're on.

**Client**
Okay. Do these suspected codes reflect on the provider's EHR before the encounter? How do they get hold of that before the encounter or does that also get integrated within Ambience?

**Expert**
No. It's not an Ambience tool at all. It's not integrated with Ambience at all. It basically generates outside of Epic. It's because Optum is part of UnitedHealthcare, they have all this claims data, they have lab data on patients and I don't know what other data sources that they have access to, but they utilize all of these external data sources to come up with the suspected conditions, to have prospectively essentially that show up basically at the very beginning of the Medicare annual wellness visit with the provider. It doesn't take into account anything that the patient is maybe talking to you about during that visit. It's based on information that it knows from prior claims and lab.

**Client**
How do the providers get to know about these suspected codes? Where do they see it, in the EHR?

## Expert
Yes, it's in a form in the EHR.

## Client
Got it. I'm guessing that before the encounter, while prepping the chart, they would also look at the list of suspected codes so that they could have conversations around them if need be.

## Expert
Yes, that's right.

## Client
Could you also talk a little bit about the team set that you have around this entire functionality? Which team use the Optum tool? Is there a dedicated billing or coding team that engages with this tool who coordinates all of this?

## Expert
No. The Clinovations team, which is an external vendor with Optum, they're the ones who run the tool. The coding team is who trains the physicians on how to utilize the form.

## Client
There is no in-house person, it's all outsourced through this team and they come and inform the providers and educate them about what needs to be done.

## Expert
I forgot what they're called but they're essentially like a coding team. They are within the health system and they work with the outside vendor on this tool. There's like an internal governance structure that they work with, like a subject matter expert within the organization that helps with adoption.

## Client
Got it. Can you talk a little bit about if you happen to have information about the payer view of things? What happens after the codes have been sent to CMS and if they have denials or teams, what does that process look like? Could you talk a little bit about that?

## Expert
Generally, if there's denials, it'll come back into the system, into the work queues that the billing staff have access to. What they'll do is they'll try to work those denials and fix them. Generally, it's a really short timeframe that they have to resubmit the claim. If it requires more information from the provider and whatnot, they'll send it as a code inquiry to provider, provider has to fix it or whatever, and then it goes back to the coding team.

Coding team will make updates that they need to and then they'll resubmit the claim. Denials are a huge issue for every organization because insurance companies, they require a specific set of rules and regulations and all these things which might be different depending on which plan you're on, what plan the patient is on and all that. It's always an uphill battle. They've made it so incredibly difficult and they don't necessarily tell you what is required to not have this thing denied.

## Client
Got it. Can you briefly, maybe not related to Ambience at all here, but more interested in understanding your engagement with the payer side, especially when it comes to medical coding, how does payer engagement differ across, let's say different payer to payer or plan to plan? Is there a standard way that you would engage with a payer and if yes what are those engagement types?

## Conversation Transcript

**Client:**
Got it. You mentioned that you also are part of the data analytics team. Is that team responsible for keeping track of the medical coding processes, like how many denials were carried out? What was coded, the risk adjustment side of things or is that again a separate team?

**Expert:**
It's a separate team. We are responsible for creating the design of the reports and the dashboards and getting clarification on the metric definitions of things but then when it comes to utilizing that data, that's a separate. Those are like the individual teams who utilize that data. For example, the finance department would be the ones who utilize that data.

**Client:**
Got it. Is there like a hierarchy? I'm trying to understand here the hierarchy of different teams. How would different teams work together? If I were to look at your organization from a high level, how would the teams be divided? I'm trying to understand how would the finance team be different from your team. I'm just trying to maybe map. Could you help me with that?

**Expert:**
The informatics team is the liaison between operations and IT. Within informatics teams, you have multiple different analysts that support different areas of the EHR. You'll have ambulatory analysts who support outpatient. You could even break it down by this analyst only supports ambulatory physician, this analyst supports ambulatory ancillary staff then you'll have another team, and it usually goes by the Epic modules in terms of what they support.

You'll have an inpatient nursing team, an inpatient physician analyst, and ASAP, which is the ER module that Epic has. You have analysts for that. You'll have Beacon analysts, who support the cancer module that Epic has. Our team is the liaison between the operations side and the clinical end users and IT because IT they're responsible for building the tools and they're developing the tool, but then they're not clinical.

We're the translators between the clinical side and the end users to the IT side. I explain it as we translate clinical specifications to technical specifications so that the tools can be built and embedded into workflows. We also translate technical specifications to clinical specifications so that it's understandable by the end users.

Your finance team is a separate arm who handles finances, billing, and whatnot. You have separate operations teams that are responsible for different areas of the business. Just like the EHR is seen as the neural network of a health system because it touches everything, your informatics team is like that as well, because we're the ones who are the connectors of the technology.

**Client:**
Got it. Thank you so much for explaining that. Given that we're close to a few minutes, I just have one more question around AI trends and adoption. What is your understanding of different solutions coming in in AI and then them getting implemented within healthcare and the adoption of ASAP providers? What's the engagement like? Are providers curious about AI coming in through all these different tools, like Ambience and even EHRs playing around with AI? What is your take on that?

**Expert:**
I think clinicians in general are open to anything that may help them, but I think there is an inherent fear around deploying the tools safely and if it'll add more work to them in terms of needing to review it but it's also dependent on what type of clinician, because nurses are very apprehensive. I think it's because of certain companies and the narrative that they've given early on that AI is going to take your job and that going to cause you more work than not.

The nursing unions are very, very powerful in the U.S. and the nursing unions do not like AI. That is going to be a huge factor when it comes to being able to adopt AI tools for nursing because you're going to be fighting this battle with the nursing unions to change their narrative on AI but for the physician side, they're optimistic, but a little apprehensive. I do think that in terms of tools, the financial side is definitely looking at a lot of different tools to help with denials.

On the clinical side, there's tools like AI-generated draft messaging to reply to patient messages, which is native functionality that Epic has. Epic is rolling out with a whole bunch of generative AI tools. The ones helping people draft messages or write better are the ones that people are interested in right now.

I do think that the way that we've been doing technology deployments and stuff like that is fundamentally going to have to change a bit as well, because you usually don't deploy a tool unless there is a known problem that you need to solve but with AI, the tools are available and you're doing the reverse where you're looking for a problem that tool will help with.

**Client**
Got it. Those were all my questions. It was really insightful talking to you. Thank you so much for your time, have a great day.
