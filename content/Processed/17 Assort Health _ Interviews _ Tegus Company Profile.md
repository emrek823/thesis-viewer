# Assort Health - Adult Joint Reconstruction Surgeon at an Orthopedic Center

**Interview conducted on February 05, 2025**

## Topics
- System Implementation
- Healthcare Administration
- AI
- Scheduling Department
- Orthopedic Meetings
- Alternatives
- Trial Period
- System Limitations

## Summary
A private practice orthopedic surgeon has been trialing the Assort Health platform for two months, experiencing hit or miss results due to limitations in scheduling with specific doctors causing frustration for staff and patients. The industry is moving towards an AI-directed scheduling model, but challenges in training and retaining staff remain. Efforts are being made to address concerns with lukewarm perception of Assort, leading to potential extension of the trial period or trialing other solutions in the future. Implementing such platforms will take time to work out kinks and optimize algorithms.

# Expert Interview Transcript

## Participants
- **Expert**: Private practice orthopedic surgeon specialized in hip and knee reconstruction.
- **Client**: Inquiring about the use of Assort.

----

### Conversation

**Client**: How was that handled before Assort?

**Expert**: We have staff in the office that sit in a scheduling department that handle all the phone calls. There's one central phone number for the practice.

**Client**: Got it. How did you come across Assort?

**Expert**: I think they saw it at ortho forum or one of the orthopedic meetings. Our director of operations came across it and decided to gather more information and do a trial with it.

**Client**: Did you look at other alternatives?

**Expert**: I believe we did. I'm not sure exactly why they chose Assort.

**Client**: Okay. When did you guys go live with Assort?

**Expert**: We've been doing a trial for about the last two months.

**Client**: When you say trial, what does that mean?

**Expert**: We didn't sign a long-term contract with them. We're just working it. It's implemented into our current system right now to see if we can work out any kinks and see if this is working well in order for us to stick with this in the long run.

**Client**: Got it. What have the results been like so far?

**Expert**: It's been hit or miss. We've just been coming across limitations that the system has had or that's resulted in some frustration from both staff and patients.

**Client**: What have those been?

**Expert**: The inability to schedule with specific doctors or when you're trying to schedule, you're not being directed in...

the same line of treatment. We're given the doctors that see a specific body part, those specific doctors not being listed, or if you're seeing a doctor for one thing. We're all subspecialists. If you're seeing somebody for your knee and you also want to see somebody for your hand, the system is not letting you schedule a second appointment unless you cancel your first one.

**Client**
Got it. Have you interacted at all with the Assort team?

**Expert**
Not interactive, but I've been given the feedback for some of the limitations that I've been seeing. Our director of operations and our scheduling department have been interacting one-on-one with them.

**Client**
Got it. What is the internal perception of Assort? Do people like it at all? Do they hate it? Do they love it?

**Expert**
Lukewarm. We understand that we're heading towards an AI-directed model. I think the limitation we've had is that the scheduling department, not only for our practice, for multiple organizations, there's a high turnover rate. It's hard to train staff and retain them, which is why we're trying to head towards an AI model, but the AI model, the patients have been frustrated where they can't speak to a live agent, or they can't schedule the specific doctor that they want to schedule with. That has led to some frustration.

**Client**
Do you know if there's any internal perception surrounding the Assort Health team or you don't know?

**Expert**
The perception is that they're making efforts to address the concerns that we bring to them. Once you address one thing, then another thing is coming up. We're identifying a new problem. I feel there is a long road of getting this to work out to be the way that we would want it to be if ever.

**Client**
Got it. Do you know whether the company plans to stick with Assort or no?

**Expert**
I think we might try to extend our trial period just to see if they can start working at the kinks and we change our mind on the current way it's working. I think 90 days is a relatively short period to identify the kinks and figure out if it's working the way we want it to.

**Client**
Do you know if you guys are planning to trial other solutions?

**Expert**
I believe we'll trial something else because even if we do get rid of Assort, we're still back in the same situation where we have a limited number of staff who are running the scheduling department. You can't rely on them because historically there has been a high turnover rate.

**Client**
How big of a company do you think can be built in this category? AI scheduling, front office administration, not on the revenue cycle or clinical side.

**Expert**
I think this is where the industry is headed. I think they're going to have less people, human interaction with

# Transcript

**Client**
Got it. How do you think about your willingness to pay for something like this?

**Expert**
If it doesn't work and if it doesn't draw patients in the business, I'm not going to pay for it.

**Client**
Would you move to a worse solution if it were cheaper?

**Expert**
If it worked better, yeah.

**Client**
Would you trade quality for a price or patient experience for price?

**Expert**
No.

**Client**
Got it. Is there anything else that you think is important to understand with respect to your experience of Assort that we haven't covered?

**Expert**
Not really. I think that if any company or any organization is looking to implement Assort or any of its competitors into their scheduling system, there is going to be a long period of time until the system works the way you want it to. This is not something like turnkey, where the next day this is going to be up and running exactly the way you want. There's going to be kinks, and you have to take the time to get the algorithms to work the way you want them to.

**Client**
Got it. I think that generally covers all of our questions. Really appreciate you taking the time. Have a great day.
