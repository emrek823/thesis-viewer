## Slide 3: INTRODUCTION

## Slide 4: The Laws of Economics Necessitate Change in the Health Economy

The inputs of the U.S. healthcare system vastly exceed its outputs, as measured by the health of the American public. And yet, over the next 10 years, health expenditures are expected to continue to grow faster than the rest of the economy, projected to reach 20.3% of GDP, or $24,200 per person, by 2033. The current trajectory of the U.S. healthcare system, one which increasingly depletes societal wealth without generating commensurate health gains, is unsustainable for patients, payers, employers and providers alike. The fact that the health economy continues to defy the laws of economics confirms that it is not a free market.

This fifth installment of the Trends Shaping the Health Economy Report provides insight into six data-driven trends that are either intensifying or emerging. The Transparency in Coverage initiative promulgated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services makes obvious that the U.S. health economy finds itself at a crossroads; the choice for health economy stakeholders is whether to implement radical and transformational change from the inside or whether to be subjected to such change by external forces, namely Federal and state government. Said differently, the question for health economy stakeholders is this: do you want to make it happen or have it happen to you?

In either scenario, every health economy stakeholder will be required to deliver demonstrable value for money, rather than perpetuating inefficiencies that compound systemic waste. To do so, stakeholders must be willing to reassess the very foundation of the U.S. healthcare system. Rather than thinking about what already exists, the fundamental question is this: what is essential?

This report does not claim to provide all the answers, but it offers a framework for asking the right questions. What trends have you not considered, and how will they impact the markets that your organization serves? What changes must your organization make to deliver more value for money relative to your current and future competitors? What changes are necessary for your organization to compete effectively in a system that can no longer sustain the status quo?

## Slide 5: The U.S. Cannot Afford Its Healthcare System

In 2023, U.S. healthcare spending reached $4.9T, or $14,570 per person, representing 17.6% of the nation’s GDP. Employers underwrite the largest share of that spending, accounting for nearly $1.4T, or 30.0% of total NHE. How long can the U.S. allocate more than $1T each to Medicare, Medicaid and interest on the Federal debt?

## Slide 6: The Most Expensive 10% of Patients Account for Two-Thirds of Spending

U.S. healthcare spending follows the Pareto Principle, also known as the 80/20 rule, in which a small proportion of patients are responsible for the majority of spending. Specifically, the most expensive 5% of the population is responsible for 49.7% of spending, while the least expensive 50% only accounts for 2.8% of spending, or $374 per person.

**Chart: Average Healthcare Expenditures per Person, by Expenditure Percentile, 2022**

## Slide 7: The U.S. Healthcare System Delivers Poor Comparative Value

In economics, value is a measure of the benefit provided by a good or service to an economic agent. By definition, spending more on healthcare with worse results is emblematic of poor value. Based on the comparative value of healthcare systems in peer countries and the comparative effect of medical and non-medical factors on overall health, the reasonable person must question the level of investment in the U.S. healthcare system.

**Diagram: Framework of Determinant Health Factors**

This diagram illustrates a hierarchical framework:
- **Policies & Programs** influence **Health Factors**.
- **Health Factors** (with associated percentages of impact on Health Outcomes) include:
    - **Social & Economic Factors (40%)**: Education, Employment, Income, Family & Social Support, Community Safety.
    - **Health Behaviors (30%)**: Tobacco Use, Diet & Exercise, Alcohol & Drug Use, Sexual Activity.
    - **Physical Environment (10%)**: Housing & Transit, Air & Water Quality.
    - **Clinical Care (20%)**: Access to Care, Quality of Care.
- All **Health Factors** contribute to **Health Outcomes**, which are broken down into:
    - **Length of Life (50%)**
    - **Quality of Life (50%)**

## Slide 8: The Performance of the U.S. Healthcare System Is a Function of Its “Design”

The U.S. healthcare system is peerless in its financial, administrative and regulatory complexity, characterized by a byzantine web of stakeholders that make the system inscrutable to the average American. Although the performance of the U.S. healthcare system has long been suboptimal, current macroeconomic conditions dictate a redesign.

## Slide 9: Demanding Value and Returning to First Principles

The U.S. healthcare system is at a crossroads. National health expenditures have increased from $2.8T in 2012 to $4.9T in 2023 despite relatively little change in demand or utilization. In 2023, healthcare spending accounted for 17.6% of GDP and is expected to reach 20.3% by 2033. Underwritten by the Federal government, state Medicaid programs, employers and the American public, the U.S. health economy is the most expensive healthcare system in the world. **Is the U.S. healthcare system worth what we spend on it? Probably not.**

Average American life expectancy is only negligibly higher than it was in 2000, has declined since 2019 and is almost four years lower than many peer OECD countries. Compared to those same peer nations, the U.S. also has higher rates of chronic disease, infant mortality, maternal mortality and avoidable mortality.

The reputation of the U.S. healthcare system often precedes itself – it is expensive, complex and inefficient. Understanding why begins with the recognition that, regardless of tax status, the “system” is a collection of profit-seeking businesses treating illness – “no margin, no mission” – rather than a thoughtful and comprehensive approach to promoting health. As a result, the U.S. healthcare system ends up providing poor care to many Americans. Additionally, the staggering $4.9T that is invested into the healthcare “system” crowds out other social investment that might contribute to improved wellbeing.

In economics, value is a measure of the benefit provided by a good or service to an economic agent. For consumer goods, value is ultimately subjective but is shaped by price, quality and convenience. In plain terms, the U.S. healthcare system does not provide good value to patients or society. With the national debt exceeding $35T (or 120% of GDP), the U.S. cannot afford to spend 20% of its GDP on a healthcare system that does not provide demonstrable value for money. **How has the U.S. health economy defied the laws of economics for so long?**

Since World War II, the U.S. health economy has not operated as a true market. For decades, the full extent of the pricing problem remained only partially understood because data on negotiated commercial rates were obfuscated by Federal antitrust restrictions and contractual agreements. At the same time, employers – who fund nearly 30% of national health expenditures – have consistently failed to demand value for money, opting to preserve the status quo rather than pursue meaningful changes to benefit design. The advent of health plan price transparency removes these historical barriers, and in a free market, price transparency always results in prices regressing to the “market mean.”

Health plan price transparency creates new obligations, requiring employers to demand value for money in order to meet their fiduciary duties under ERISA and nearly every state’s corporate statutes. Once employers begin to exert this pressure, every other stakeholder in the health economy will lose something – a dynamic that defines a negative-sum game. It is time that health economy stakeholders, like PBMs, begin to lose instead of patients, whom the system is failing.

Transforming the U.S. healthcare system requires a return to first principles. Originally attributed to Aristotle in the 4th century BCE, first principles thinking requires individuals to strip away all "common wisdom" and break things down into their most basic, undeniable truths. Once you reach the fundamental building blocks of a problem, you can reason upward.

What is the core goal of a healthcare system? Does spending more on healthcare mean better health? When is health insurance useful? Do hospitals need to be the central hub of clinical care? Should employers be the main source of healthcare coverage? Should society underwrite the cost of poor health that is attributable to poor lifestyle behaviors or instead promote health and incentivize healthy lifestyles? **Rather than thinking about what already exists, what is essential?**

## Slide 10: Analysis of Demand, Supply and Yield Reveals Six Key Trends

This report provides a data-driven analysis of six trends that will define the landscape, and subsequent challenges, that will impact every health economy stakeholder. The original research findings featured in this annual series are gleaned from proprietary Trilliant Health datasets and analytic models that measure various dimensions of demand, supply and yield across the health economy. To study healthcare demand, (i.e., utilization), we leveraged our national all-payer medical and pharmacy claims database. The Trilliant Health Provider Directory was used to study the supply of 5.2M providers, allied health professionals and organizations. The intersection of supply and demand informs expected yield. To measure yield, we leveraged our health plan price transparency dataset, which provides negotiated rate data across large national and small regional health plans. These data components allow for the triangulation of what service was provided, where the service was provided, who provided the service and how much the service cost. In addition to the primary data analyses conducted using Trilliant Health assets, the report includes other publicly available information (e.g., financial statements) and secondary sources (e.g., American Hospital Association, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention).

**Definitions of Key Concepts**

| Concept | Definition | Primary Data Source |
| :------ | :--------- | :------------------ |
| Demand  | refers to both the exogenous and endogenous factors that influence consumer preferences for, need for and utilization of healthcare services. | National all-payer claims database |
| Supply  | refers to the various providers of health services ranging from hospitals and physician practices to retail pharmacies, new entrants and virtual care platforms. | Provider Directory |
| Yield   | refers to the intersection of demand and supply (i.e., price) and is also influenced by market factors such as policy regulations and reimbursement incentives. | Health plan price transparency dataset |

## Slide 15: ICHRAs Aim to Increase Choice and Lower Employer Costs

ICHRAs are a type of employer-sponsored health benefit plan that allow employers to provide tax-exempt allowances for employees to purchase individual health insurance. As individual and employer health insurance costs continue to grow, ICHRAs provide an alternative approach for employer-sponsored insurance, primarily among small employers. To date, ICHRA adoption remains limited – offered to roughly 200,000 employer-sponsored individuals in 2025 – and their impact on health and spending remains to be seen.

| Coverage Payment Arrangement | Employers decide how much money to contribute to employees.                                       | Employers offer a subsidized plan or a selection of subsidized plans to employees.       |
| Coverage Flexibility      | Employees choose their health insurance plan based on availability in the individual market.      | Employees have a plan or selection of plans to choose based on what the employer offers. |
| Coverage Portability      | If employees leave the company, they can keep their current plan but pay the premiums in full. | Coverage is terminated when employees leave the company.                                |

## Slide 16: Patients Encounter Declining Affordability and Access

The share of adults reporting the ability to access and pay for healthcare (“cost secure”) declined from 56% in 2021 to 51% in 2024. Meanwhile, the share of Americans unable to access and pay for healthcare (“cost desperate”) reached a high of 11%. The inability to afford and access healthcare was more pronounced among underserved populations, with the share of cost desperate Hispanic adults increasing by 8 PP and Black adults by 5 PP between 2021 and 2024.

## Slide 17: The Financial Burden of Medical Care Is Detrimental to Health Outcomes

Financial toxicity – the negative impact of medical costs on a patient’s financial wellbeing – disproportionately impacts patients with serious illnesses, such as heart disease or cancer. In 2021, 15% of American households owed medical debt. One study found that a one percentage point increase in the population with medical debt was associated with 18.3 more physically unhealthy days per 1,000 people. Additionally, higher-income adults in poor health are more likely to report medical debt than lower-income adults in good health.

## Slide 21: Amid Drug Affordability Concerns, Medication Adherence Suffers

In 2021, 9.2M U.S. adults reported non-adherence with prescription medications due to cost, with more women, minority populations, low-income adults and the uninsured disproportionately affected. Regardless of the cause, the trend of low prescription adherence mirrors the declining health status of Americans.

## Slide 22: TREND 2 Health Economy Stakeholders Are Slow To Adapt to Changing Demographic and Lifestyle Trends

## Slide 23: Americans Live Shorter Lives and Spend More Years in Poor Health

After steadily rising for most of the last century, U.S. life expectancy has flatlined over the past decade. In 2021, the average American spent 12.5 years in poor health. In contrast, residents of OECD countries live four to eight years longer and spend more of those years in good health.

## Slide 24: Avoidable Mortality Is Consistently Higher in the U.S. Than in OECD Countries

In 2021, the avoidable mortality rate per 100,000 population was 407.8 in the U.S. and 301.3 in OECD countries. Across states, the avoidable mortality rate ranged from 268.1 in Utah to 617.6 in Mississippi. Since 2009, avoidable mortality has worsened across all U.S. states, with 43 states exceeding the OECD average.

## Slide 25: Chronic Disease Burden Continues to Shape U.S. Mortality

Heart disease and cancer are consistently the leading causes of death in the U.S., responsible for 204.1 and 185.1 deaths per 100,000 population, respectively, in 2024. However, since 2018, the mortality rate for other leading causes of death has accelerated, with mortality from chronic liver disease (19.1%), stroke (10.2%) and diabetes (8.5%), outpacing the growth in heart disease (1.9%) and cancer (1.0%).

## Slide 27: Unhealthy Lifestyle Behaviors Contribute to Declining Health Status

In 2023, 24.2% of U.S. adults reported no physical activity in the past month. In the same period, 21.7% reported binge drinking and 22.6% used tobacco. Between 2021 and 2023, fast food accounted for as much as 18.1% of calories consumed by obese adults ages 20-39. Regardless of age or income level, more than half of calories were derived from ultra-processed foods.

## Slide 30: L&D Closures Exemplify Tension Between Demand, Access and Specialization

As health systems continue to compete for a shrinking number of births, an increasing number have shuttered their L&D units altogether, with many citing the declining rate of patients. Through the first half of 2025, at least 17 health systems had announced unit closures. This trend is acute in rural areas, where fewer than 42% of rural hospitals still offer L&D services.

## Slide 31: MA Enrollment Accelerates as Employer-Sponsored Insurance Remains Flat

Commercially insured Americans have traditionally accounted for the majority of profitable revenue across the health economy. However, the employer-sponsored share of the population is flat to declining, remaining unchanged from 2023 to 2024. While the number and share of Medicare beneficiaries increases, enrollment is growing disproportionately in Medicare Advantage, which is projected to account for 64% of Medicare beneficiaries by 2034.

## Slide 38: Primary Care Supply Is Insufficient and Uneven

While there is a general physician shortage in the U.S., primary care physicians are most affected, with a projected adequacy of 81% by 2036. Although the allied health workforce has the potential to bolster primary care access, 72.7% of U.S. counties are designated as a primary care professional shortage area.

## Slide 39: Specialist Supply Exceeds Primary Care in Several Metropolitan Areas

Across the CBSAs analyzed, primary care physicians consistently had the largest shortages, with many markets facing deficits in the hundreds. In contrast, dermatology and gastroenterology exhibited more localized imbalances. While some CBSAs had notable shortages, others had modest surpluses, with the largest surpluses totaling 246 dermatologists and 295 gastroenterologists.

## Slide 41: Pay Disparities Reveal the Perceived Value of Primary Care

Despite its central role in prevention and chronic disease management, primary care compensation remains well below specialty physicians. In 2024, primary care physicians earned an average of $303,435, close to half the average of specialist physicians ($593,697). As new physicians graduate with an average of $194,280 in debt and enter residency earning approximately $60,000, it is unsurprising that many are drawn to higher-paying specialties.

## Slide 42: Most Retailers Have Exited Primary Care in Favor of Specialty Pharmacy

As of 2025, major retailers have either exited or reduced their direct primary care operations. In contrast, each organization has maintained or expanded its presence in specialty pharmacy, where capabilities in distribution and integration with existing care delivery assets have warranted continued investment.

**Table: Retailer Primary Care and Specialty Pharmacy Strategies**

| **CVS Health**    | 2014 (MinuteClinic expansion), 2021 (Acquisition of Oak Street Health) | Acquired Oak Street Health for $10.6B to operate value-based senior primary care clinics combined with existing MinuteClinic and Aetna Medicare Advantage. | Slowed expansion of Oak Street clinics; some closures reported; facing profitability and integration challenges.     | Active, but scaling back | Aggressively expanding specialty pharmacy via Caremark and Cordavis.                              |
| **Walgreens**     | 2021 (Major investment in VillageMD)               | Invested $6B for majority stake in VillageMD to co-locate full-service primary care clinics in stores.           | Announced in early 2024 that it would close ~160 VillageMD clinics and sell majority stake amid $5B writedown.         | Exit                    | Focused on specialty growth via Shields Health Solutions (acquired 2022).                        |
| **Amazon**        | 2019 (Amazon Care), 2022 (Acquisition of One Medical) | Launched Amazon Care; later acquired One Medical for $3.9B to scale hybrid primary care.                        | Shut down Amazon Care in 2022. One Medical still operating but experiencing slow growth and unclear integration with Amazon Prime. | Pivoted                 | Entered specialty pharmacy in 2023 via Amazon Pharmacy, now expanding offerings to include specialty medications. |
| **Walmart**       | 2019 (Walmart Health centers)                      | Built de novo primary care clinics offering low-cost care near stores, targeting self-pay and Medicare Advantage patients. | In 2024, announced exit from 51 health centers and halted further expansion, citing unsustainable costs. Maintains a few clinics in select markets. | Exit                    | Exploring partnerships and payer collaborations in specialty. No standalone specialty pharmacy brand, but strong retail pharmacy infrastructure could support future entry. |

**Quote:** “The decision to close all 51 health centers across five states and shut down the virtual care offering was not easy. While we will no longer operate health centers, we will take what we learned as we provide trusted health and wellness services across the country through our nearly 4,600 Pharmacies...Over the past few years, the importance of Pharmacies has continued to grow, and we have expanded the clinical capabilities of the services we provide. We continue to offer immunizations and have grown to provide Testing and Treatment services, access to specialty pharmacy medication and care, as well as other essential services such as medication therapy management and a variety of health screenings.” – Walmart press release

## Slide 44: Behavioral Health Demand Is Rising, but Access Remains a Challenge

Nearly one in five U.S. adults report anxiety or depression, but only 13.4% receive therapy, up from 9.5% in 2019. Reported barriers to behavioral health care include high costs (80%), lack of insurance coverage (74%) and inadequate provider supply (63%). The USPSTF recommends depression screening for adolescents ages 12-18 using the same standardized questions as adults, while anxiety screenings begin as early as age eight with tools simplified for children.

## Slide 45: Emerging Chronic Conditions Signal a General Sense of Unwellness

Between 2021 and 2024, most emerging chronic conditions increased in prevalence, with the largest relative growth observed in long COVID (68.0%), obstructive sleep apnea (46.3%) and NAFLD/NASH (27.0%). In 2023, a formal ICD-10 diagnosis was established for POTS, which resulted in a 34.0% increase from 2023 to 2024. These trends suggest shifting clinical attention and diagnostic activity toward certain metabolic, respiratory and post-viral conditions.

## Slide 48: Nearly Half of All Cancer Diagnoses Occur at a Late Stage

Despite the clear correlation between early diagnosis and survival, nearly half of all cancer cases are diagnosed at a late stage, which remained relatively unchanged from 2017 to 2021. Even among screenable cancers, the share of cancer cases diagnosed at a late stage ranges from 24% for prostate cancer to 69% for lung cancer.

Oncology treatments account for over half of the clinical development pipelines of AstraZeneca (61.9%), Merck (51.5%) and Pfizer (50.9%). AstraZeneca has significantly expanded its overall pipeline since last year, resulting in a larger number of oncology drugs in development than either Pfizer or Merck. Eli Lilly’s cardiometabolic pipeline, which includes GLP-1 therapies, now exceeds its oncology pipeline.

## Slide 59: Hospitals Spend More on Healthcare Administration Than Direct Patient Care

From 2011 to 2023, both administrative and direct patient care expenditures increased in absolute terms, reaching $687B and $346B, respectively, but administrative costs have grown at a faster pace (87.2%). Generally, these spending allocations are strongly correlated, the ratio of which can be used as a measure of hospital efficiency.

## Slide 62: More Urban Hospitals Are Claiming Rural Status

The share of hospital beds classified as “administratively rural” grew from 13% to 45% between 2013 and 2023, driven by the dual classification of many urban hospitals. This expansion allows large metropolitan facilities to access rural-focused subsidies and programs like 340B under lower thresholds than those applied to urban hospitals.

## Slide 65: …And EHRs Are Even More Expensive, With Low Return on Investment

The EHR market is highly concentrated, with Epic having 42.3% market share in 2024, up from 31.0% in 2021. Several challenges to EHR adoption and meaningful use persist, including high costs, limited patient uptake and lack of interoperability. While intended to improve efficiency, most physicians disagree that the EHR improves their workflow.

## Slide 66: Duplicate Insurance Coverage Drives Billions in Excess Spending

In 2024, 2.8M people were enrolled in more than one Medicaid and/or ACA exchange plan, resulting in at least $4.3B in duplicate payments. In the same year, nearly 8M ACA exchange enrollees (37%) did not have a medical claim. Relatedly, dual enrollment between VHA and MA coverage increased by 62.9% from 2011 to 2020. For dual enrollees, MA plans still receive full capitated payments, which corresponds to duplicate Federal payment for the care of the same beneficiaries.

## Slide 67: Healthcare Middlemen Are Wasteful and Inefficient

Healthcare middlemen, such as health insurance brokers, exist to facilitate negotiations but frequently add complexity, while receiving opaque financial remuneration. For example, brokers could receive $10.9M in commissions from a self-insured employer with 50,000 employees in the Pacific region.

**Diagram: Health Insurance Broker Overview**

This diagram illustrates the flow of money involving a health insurance broker.
- **Employer** provides an **Employer + employee premium contribution** (flow of money) to **Health Insurance Broker**.
- **Employee** provides **Employee premium** (flow of money) to **Health Insurance Broker**.
- **Health Insurance Broker** provides **Broker fees** (flow of money) to **Employer**.
- **Health Insurance Broker** provides **Broker commission** (flow of money) to **Employee**.
- **Health Insurance Broker** transfers funds (implicitly) to **Health Plan**.

(The diagram visually depicts how employers and employees pay premiums to a broker, who then takes a commission and transfers funds related to the health plan.)

## Slide 68: PBMs Add Complexity to the Drug Distribution and Pricing Process

PBMs negotiate rebates and discounts from manufacturers, design drug formularies and oversee pharmacy networks and claims processing on behalf of payers. The three largest PBMs, which fill nearly 80% of prescriptions, are vertically integrated with insurers and pharmacies. While theoretically positioned to help control drug spending, undisclosed financial incentives have the opposite effect. For consumers, actual savings are unpredictable, variable and situational.

**Diagram: PBM Overview**

This diagram illustrates the complex interactions involving a Pharmacy Benefit Manager (PBM) in the drug supply chain.

- **Health Plan** interacts with **Pharmacy Benefit Manager (PBM)** by:
    - Managing drug benefit (Service flow to PBM)
    - Administrative fees, payment for drug and dispensing fees (Money flow to PBM)
    - Share of rebates (Money flow from PBM)
- **PBM** interacts with **Drug Manufacturer** by:
    - Negotiating formulary placement (Service flow to Manufacturer)
    - Payment for drug (Money flow to Manufacturer)
    - Negotiated rebate (Money flow from Manufacturer)
- **Drug Manufacturer** interacts with **Wholesaler** by:
    - Contracting directly to supply drugs (Drug flow)
- **Wholesaler** interacts with **PBM** and **Pharmacy** by:
    - Contracting directly to supply drugs (Drug flow)
    - Payment for drug (Money flow from PBM to Wholesaler)
    - Payment for drug (Money flow from Pharmacy to Wholesaler)
- **PBM** interacts with **Pharmacy** by:
    - Payment for drug and dispensing fee (Money flow to Pharmacy)
    - Contracting directly to dispense drugs (Service flow to Pharmacy)
- The "spread" is indicated as the difference between payments to PBMs from health plans and payments from PBMs to pharmacies.

(This complex diagram visually represents the multifaceted role of PBMs in drug pricing and distribution, highlighting both drug and money flows, and the concept of "the spread".)

## Slide 69: Misaligned Incentives Continue to Hinder Biosimilar and Generic Savings

Between 2014 and 2023, generics and biosimilars generated $3.1T in savings. Despite these savings, biosimilars are dispensed just 19.2% of the time when available. Across leading biologics, ASP fell by 1% to 95% after the launch of a biosimilar, though market share ranged from 27% to 88% as of Q3 2024.

## Slide 70: Over 75% of FDA-Approved Drugs Are Not Recommended by NICE

Despite costing 56.1% less in the U.K. than the U.S., NICE has determined that many FDA-approved drugs do not meet the necessary clinical and cost-effectiveness thresholds required for coverage by the NHS.

**Text Box: NICE Overview**
**What is NICE?**
The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) provides clinical guidelines, technology appraisals and quality standards on treatment and care for providers, social workers, patients and caregivers in the U.K. NICE guidelines are intended to improve patient outcomes, in line with the best available evidence of clinical and cost-effectiveness.
Experts have estimated that NICE’s maximum cost-effectiveness threshold is £20,000–30,000/QALY.

## Slide 71: Value for Money Remains Elusive for Many Specialty Therapies

Specialty drugs consistently launch above their health benefit price benchmarks, the range ICER deems cost-effective. Cost per QALY is also typically above these thresholds, ranging from $127K (Libmeldy®) to $2.3M (Winrevair®). Few remain affordable beyond 20% uptake – while Rezdiffra® demonstrates value within benchmark, it impacts budgets at just 6.5% uptake, and Tab-cel® and Rytelo® scale to nearly all patients but exceed $150K per QALY.

## Slide 72: TREND 5 The Transition to Alternative Care Settings and Therapies Is Accelerating

## Slide 73: The Cycle of Innovation Influences Rate of Care Migration Outside the Hospital

New treatment paradigms are frequently introduced in the hospital setting, then migrate to less intensive and expensive outpatient settings over time. Historically, novel complex therapies (e.g., CAR-T) replace the lost inpatient care and start a new cycle of innovation.

## Slide 75: Site of Care Utilization Differs by Age Group and Clinical Need

While care utilization varies by setting, different trends are observed across age groups and visit reasons (i.e., diagnosis). For example, among adults ages 18-44, 74.7% of telehealth utilization was for behavioral health reasons.

**Diagram: Healthcare Utilization, by Age Group, Care Setting and ICD-10 Chapter, 2024**
(Sankey diagram showing flows between Age Group, Care Setting, and ICD-10 Chapter)

**Age Group Categories:**
- 0-17
- 18-44
- 45-64

**Care Setting Categories:**
- Independent clinic
- Hospital outpatient
- Ambulatory surgery center
- Telehealth
- Other non-hospital outpatient
- Home health
- Hospital inpatient
- Physician office
- Urgent care
- Emergency department

**ICD-10 Chapter Categories (Reasons for Visit/Diagnosis):**
- Factors influencing health status and contact with health services
- Mental, behavioral and neurodevelopmental disorders
- Diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue
- Symptoms, signs and abnormal clinical and laboratory findings, not elsewhere classified
- Diseases of the respiratory system
- Endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases
- Diseases of the skin and subcutaneous tissue
- Diseases of the nervous system
- Injury, poisoning and certain other consequences of external causes
- Diseases of the circulatory system
- Diseases of the genitourinary system
- Diseases of the eye and adnexa
- Neoplasms
- Diseases of the digestive system
- Other

(The diagram visually shows the varying pathways of care, for instance, a strong flow from 18-44 age group to Telehealth, and then a strong flow from Telehealth to Mental, behavioral and neurodevelopmental disorders. Physician office is a large initial destination for all age groups.)

## Slide 76: Patient Journey Varies for Clinically Similar Patients

Although clinically similar, these four patients have disparate care utilization patterns. Patients with higher behavioral health utilization (Patients 2 and 3) show more coordinated, outpatient-focused care, while those with minimal behavioral health care (Patients 1 and 4) rely more on emergency and acute settings.

**Patient Profile (common to all):** Gender: Male, Age: 50, Comorbidities: Depression, Diabetes, Hypertension.

## Slide 77: Most Patients Are Not Loyal to a Single Health System

Among four health systems in geographically diverse markets, market share in 2023-2024 ranged from 12.1% at UCLA to 32.3% at HCA in Dallas. HCA had the largest share of loyal patients, with 31.6% using the system for at least 81% of all hospital care. UCLA saw the largest decline in highly loyal patients, decreasing from 26.4% in 2018-2019 to 18.6% in 2023-2024.

## Slide 78: Inpatient Surgical Volume Is Threatened by the Proposed IPO List Removal

In July 2025, CMS proposed to eliminate the Medicare IPO list over the next three years, beginning with 285 mostly musculoskeletal procedures. After TKAs were removed from the IPO list in 2018, inpatient volume declined by 17.9% from 2017 to 2018, with 2024 inpatient TKA volume 85.4% below 2017. Similarly, inpatient volume for THA declined by 35.8% in the year following its removal, with 2024 inpatient THA volume 66.1% below 2019.

## Slide 81: Outpatient Migration Will Shift Revenue to ASCs and Reduce Spending

In July 2025, CMS proposed to eliminate the Medicare IPO list. Lumbar spinal fusion (CPT 22558) is among the proposed procedures that would also be moved to the ASC CPL. When 100% of Medicare lumbar spinal fusions are inpatient, spending total $1.1B. However, if 50% of lumbar spinal fusions were performed in HOPDs and 50% in ASCs, expenditures would total $760.2M, a net reduction of $359.8M.

**Table: Potential Scenarios for Medicare Inpatient vs. Outpatient Lumbar Spinal Fusion Utilization and Associated Spending**

| Scenario    | Description                                   | Volume x Payment                                         | Spending (USD) |
| :---------- | :-------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------- | :------------- |
| Scenario 1  | • 100% Inpatient                              | • 40,000 Lumbar spinal fusion x $28,000                  | $1.1B          |

**Note:** ASC denotes ambulatory surgery center; CMS denotes Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services; CPL denotes Covered Procedures List; HOPD denotes hospital outpatient department; IPO denotes Inpatient Only list. CPT 22558 denotes arthrodesis, anterior interbody technique, including minimal discectomy to prepare interspace (other than for decompression); lumbar. Because CPT 22558 is currently designated as an inpatient-only procedure, no outpatient Medicare rates exist. To approximate outpatient payment levels, ratios of inpatient-to-HOPD-to-ASC rates from other comparable procedures were applied.

## Slide 82: Patient Travel Depends on Procedure Complexity and Access to Care

For ongoing chronic condition management, 44.4% of dialysis care occurs within five miles of a patient’s home, compared to 28.3% for craniotomy, 29.5% for joint replacement and 35.5% for TAVR/TMVR. From 2018 to 2024, the proportion of surgeries performed more than 50 miles from a patient’s home declined by 6.3 PP, compared to a 2.2 PP increase in dialysis. The increased travel for dialysis care could be explained by facility closures, while reduced travel for surgical care could be an indicator of broader accessibility.

## Slide 83: Rural Care Access Is Shrinking as Hospitals Close and Cut Inpatient Services

Since 2015, 109 rural hospitals have closed, and since 2023, 40 more have shifted to emergency-only care. Currently, 314 rural hospitals remain at immediate risk of closure, while another 760 are financially vulnerable. Despite low demand and limited reimbursement, many remain open as the sole care provider and as a critical anchor to the local economy.

## Slide 84: Telehealth Utilization Continues To Decline

Since 2020, telehealth volume has declined by 32.2%, down 52.0% for non-behavioral virtual care. Telehealth for the treatment and management of behavioral health conditions has emerged as a viable substitute for in-person care but declined from 70.5% of all telehealth volume in 2023 to 66.9% in 2024.

## Slide 85: Most Patients Receive In-Person Care Exclusively

Across age groups, most patients consistently pursue in-person only healthcare. While hybrid care peaked amid the COVID-19 pandemic, it has declined but stabilized at over 25% for patients ages 18-44 and is lowest among children. Across adult age groups, women are more likely to pursue hybrid care than men.

**Charts: Share of In-Person Only, Hybrid and Telehealth Only Patients, by Age and Gender, 2018, 2020, 2022 and 2024**
(Eight line charts, faceted by Age Group and Gender)
- **Y-axis:** Share of Patients (%) from 0% to 100%
- **X-axis:** Years (2018, '20, '22, 2024)

**General Trends Observed Across Charts:**
- **In-person only:** Consistently the largest share across all age groups and genders, generally above 75%, showing slight fluctuations but remaining dominant.
- **Hybrid:** Peaked around 2020-2022 (COVID-19 pandemic years), then declined. For 18-44 age group, it stabilized above 25%. Women show higher hybrid care utilization than men.
- **Telehealth only:** Generally a very small share, often below 5-10%, across all groups and years.

(Due to the large number of data points and lack of specific values on the lines, a precise table for each year and category is not feasible. The descriptive summary above captures the key information.)

## Slide 86: Surgical Procedures May Be Imperiled by Novel Drugs

As new therapies enter the market, the prevailing procedure-based approach to care will change. Between 2018 and 2023, GLP-1 patients increased by 744.6%, while bariatric surgery volume was flat to declining. During the same period, SGLT2 inhibitor patients grew by 231.7% as cardiac catheterization volume declined by 14.4%. However, in both clinical use cases, a small patient cohort was prescribed medications both before and after surgery, calling into question the extent to which these medications serve as replacements versus supplements to surgery.

## Slide 87: DTC Prescribers Are Influencing the Patient Journey More Often

DTC prescribing-focused new entrants offer expanded choices for consumers. With vertical integration, these stakeholders will influence more of the prescription drug patient journey, disrupting traditional patient-provider relationships, potentially increasing care fragmentation and duplication.
