| :-------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Patient ID for life sciences (clinical trials and commercial)** | Only counts/statistics. No way to link to real patients. | Shallow data (excludes unstructured notes, imaging, claims history, etc), fragmented data across systems, stale                              | Full longitudinal record (structured + unstructured, imaging, claims) actionable at the patient level.                                                                                                                                               |

## Slide 5: Problem

**Problem**

The industry can't capture this value, however, because data movement today is slow, fragmented, and complicated

**Today's World**

*   **Fragmented:** Many to Many Network
    *   100 million requests per year
    *   90,000 medical facilities ([Citation](Citation))
*   **Complicated:** Retrieving medical entails sending faxes to facilities and then tracking their return. Processes relies mostly on human effort.
*   **Slow:** Retrieving a medical record takes between 30 to 45 days.

**(Diagram shows a many-to-many connection between 8 'Requestor' boxes and 4 'Clinic'/'Hospital' boxes.)**

## Slide 6: Why now?

**Why now?**

Now is the time to change this because...

**Market**
Bundling and unbundling of markets - right time to strike as vendor neutrality fades
Other...

**Tech**
LLMs enable analysis of this data at scale to drive insights from raw data
Other...

## Slide 7: Solution: Neutral Middleware Layer

**Solution: Neutral Middleware Layer**

To truly solve this problem, we need a neutral middleware layer that is fast, centralized, and simple.

**The Center - Hermes Middleware**

*   **Simplified Network:** Hermes Health Integrates with Partners to create a simple layer for Requestors to request and receive medical records.
*   **Centralized Analytics:** Streamline data tracking and reporting for both Requestors and Partners.

**Value of Being the Center**

*   **Offer New Services:** Centralized control creates opportunities to offer additional services to both Requestors and Partners.
*   **Better Insights, Better Results:** Understand the flow of data clearly and use it to optimize operations to reduce costs, and speed up access to medical data.

**(Diagram shows 8 'Requestor' boxes converging into 'Hermes - Middleware', which then diverges to 'ROI Vendors', 'Claims', 'EHR', and 'Facilities'.)**

## Slide 8: Long-term Vision

**Long-term Vision**

Executing on this vision creates data network effects that will change the way we think about and interact with healthcare data.

**Our Core Beliefs**

*   The winner in this space will be neutral. Neutrality is the MOAT. Neutrality is our Superpower.
*   Analysis is commoditized in age of AI and demand for data will only increase. We must own data access.
*   Driving access to the long-tail of requestors will create new use cases

**Hermes Health Flywheel Effect**
*   More Requestors
*   More Record Volume
*   Faster and Easier Records
*   More Vendors Integrate to Capture Volume

## Slide 22: Hidden Doors Exist in Healthcare

**Hidden Doors Exist in Healthcare**

*   Hospitals / Clinics are not the sole custodians of a patient health data.
*   Other Custodians include:
    *   Release of Information (ROI) Vendors
    *   Electronic Health Record (EHR) Vendors
    *   Claims Clearinghouses
    *   Imaging Software
    *   Regional Health Information Exchanges

**(Image of a corridor with multiple closed wooden doors.)**

## Slide 23: Hermes Finds and Unlocks these Hidden Doors

**Hermes Finds and Unlocks these Hidden Doors**

**Unlock and Integrate with Partners**

Hermes Health finds and integrates with Partners to unlock these hidden doors enabling Requestors to access them.

All records are requested and delivered through the Hermes Data Network — one centralized platform—abstracting complexity out of the process.

**Value of Integration to Partners**

*   **New Revenue:** Monetize their access to data through a new customer segment.
*   **Less Overhead:** Reduced administrative burden servicing medical record requests.
*   **Trust:** Integrate without exposing proprietary data like contract terms, routing logic, or site directories to competitors.

**The Center - Hermes Middleware**

*   **Simplified Network:** Hermes Health Integrates with Partners to create a simple layer for Requestors to request and receive medical records.
*   **Centralized Analytics:** Streamline data tracking and reporting for both Requestors and Partners.

**Value of Being the Center**

*   **Offer New Services:** Centralized control creates opportunities to offer additional services to both Requestors and Partners.
*   **Better Insights, Better Results:** Understand the flow of data clearly and use it to optimize operations to reduce costs, and speed up access to medical data.

24

## Slide 25: Partners Can't Be The Center

**Partners Can't Be The Center**

**Why Can't Partners Be The Center**

*   **Competitive Conflict:** Partners compete with each other, making it difficult for any single partner to act as a neutral hub for all.
*   **Limited Footprint:** Individual partners have a limited footprint on a patient data record. As a result they cannot fulfill all requests.
*   **Trust:** Partners don't trust each other and as a result hesitate to share proprietary information directly with each other, restricting cooperation.
*   **Complex Integration:** Direct connections among multiple partners create costly complexity, duplication, and labor.

**(Image of a group of serious-looking people in a comic book style.)**

## Slide 26: Flywheel and Moat

**Flywheel and Moat**

**Two-Sided Marketplace**

Hermes Health connects Requestors with Partners creating value for both sides:

*   **Partners Benefit Via:**
    *   Increased Requests from Requestors increases Vendors revenue.
    *   Reduced fulfillment costs by switching Requestors to electronic submission and delivery
*   **Requestors Benefit Via:**
    *   Simplified record submission and delivery increasing, enabling increased demand for more requests
    *   Improved turnaround times

**Hermes Health Flywheel Effect**
*   More Requestors
*   More Record Volume
*   Faster and Easier Records
*   More Vendors Integrate to Capture Volume

## Slide 28: Simple, Aligned Economics

**Simple, Aligned Economics**

**Simple Pricing**

*   Hermes Health monetizes the Requestors
*   Hermes Health pays the Partner on a per record or patient basis based on the dataset.
*   Margin comes from the spread between what we charge the Requestors vs what the Partners charge us.
*   60% to 50% margins for each product line.

## Slide 35: Step 1: HIPAA Checker

**Step 1: HIPAA Checker**

**Problem: Incomplete HIPAA Authorizations**

*   Customer-submitted HIPAA Authorizations are frequently missing key elements required by providers.
*   These deficiencies lead to denials — wasting time and money, with feedback loops often exceeding 20 days.

**Solution: HIPAA Auth Checker**

*   Automatically reviews HIPAA Authorizations for 10 compliance gaps.
*   Flags missing or invalid components and suggests precise corrections to ensure provider acceptance.

**(Left side shows a partial HIPAA Release Form - New Jersey.)**
**(Right side shows "HIPAA Compliance Check" results):**

**HIPAA Compliance Check**

1.  **Patient Identifiers**
    ✅
2.  **Dates of Service**
    Date(s) of service not found: startDateOfService, endDateOfService
    ❌
3.  **Authorized Recipient Information**
    Recipient information is provided and includes: Matthews & Associates and HCSV4, LLC dba Clientguard.ai with respective addresses and contact information
    ✅
4.  **PHI Description**
    Comprehensive list of medical documents and records specified, however, the specific dates of service are not mentioned
    ❌
5.  **Purpose of Disclosure**
    Purpose for the disclosure is specified as for purposes of the individual's legal injury claim(s)
    ✅
6.  **Expiration Date**
    hipaaExpirationDate not found
    ❌
7.  **Right to Revoke**
    The form explicitly states the patient's right to revoke the authorization in writing at any time
    ✅
8.  **Potential for Redisclosure**
    The form contains information explaining that the disclosed PHI might be redisclosed and may no longer be protected under HIPAA
    ✅
9.  **Patient Rights Acknowledgement**
    The form statement mentions that the patient is not required to sign and does so voluntarily, and has read the provided information
    ✅
10. **Authorization Execution**
    The authorization was executed with the patient's signature (Ange Denghty - assumed typo), but the date of signature is missing
    ❌

## Slide 36: Step 2: Site Sonar

**Step 2: Site Sonar**

**Problem: Bad Site Information**

*   Patients often cannot recall or accurately name the site details where they received care
*   Medical canvassing is time-consuming and expensive.

**Solution: Site Sonar**

*   Site Sonar uses a patient's PII and our Partner Network to automatically find care sites a patient has visited. Output includes:
    *   Facility Name
    *   Address
    *   Speciality
    *   Date

**(Table shows sample data of care sites):**

| Name ↓↑                      | Earliest Service Date | Address                              | Specialty             |

## Slide 37: Step 3: Site Finder

**Step 3: Site Finder**

**Problem: Messy Facility Data**

*   Customer-submitted facility details are messy and inconsistent
*   Manually identifying the correct metadata such as release of information vendor, location, fax, ect

**Solution: Site Finder**

*   Automatically cleans and standardizes facility address
*   Cross-references with Hermes national Site List. If matched, intelligently outputs the corresponding site meta data:
    *   Release of information vendor
    *   Fax
    *   ect.....

**(Image shows "Submitted Site Information" and "Site Finder Results")**

**Submitted Site Information**
Submitted Site Name: Ochsner Health
Submitted Site Address: 1203 S Tyler St
Submitted Site City: Covington
Submitted Site State: LA

**Release Site**
Site Finder | Link Existing Site | + Add New Site

**Site Finder Results**

**NSRC Ochsner Health Center - South Tyler (#390)**

*   **Basic Information**
    *   Site Name: NSRC Ochsner Health Center - South Tyler (#390)
    *   System Name: Ochsner Health System (#157)
    *   ROI Vendor: MRO
*   **Contact Information**
    *   Main Phone: Not provided
*   **Location**
    *   Address: 1203 S Tyler St, Covington, LA 70433, USA
    *   Formatted Address: 1203 S Tyler St, Covington, LA 70433, USA
*   **Records Department**
    *   Records Phone: Not provided
    *   Records Fax: Not provided
    *   Records Website: Not provided

**Match Reason:**
Both facilities are located at 1203 S. Tyler St., Covington, LA 70433, and are associated with Ochsner Health. The first facility is listed as "Ochsner Health 1203 S Tyler St, Covington, LA 70433, USA," which corresponds to the address of Ochsner Health Center - South Tyler. ([ochsner.org](https://www.ochsner.org/locations/ochsner-health-center-south-tyler/?utm_source=openai)) The second facility, "Ochsner Health System (#157) NSRC Ochsner Health Center - South Tyler (#390) 1203 S Tyler St, Covington, LA 70433, USA," also matches this address and includes identifiers (#157) and (#390) that likely refer to internal designations within the Ochsner Health System. Given the identical addresses and association with Ochsner Health, it is highly likely that both facilities belong to the same health system.

## Slide 38: Step 4: Smart Router

**Step 4: Smart Router**

**Problem: Submission Disparity**

*   Submitting records through the optimal submission path is complex:
    *   Fax
    *   ROI specific vendor portal
    *   Bespoke Integration

**Solution: Smart Router**

*   Hermes Health submits the record request on behalf of the customer by:
    *   Routing directly to its ROI Partners
    *   Faxing validated facilities using our efax service

**(Image shows an icon representing a document being routed through a network.)**

## Slide 39: Step 5: OCR & Text Extraction

**Step 5: OCR & Text Extraction**

**Problem: Image Based Document**

*   Sites often send documents back that are scanned image of text documents
*   These documents are thus hard to work with since they are not text based document

**Solution: Text Extraction & OCR**

*   **Text Extraction:** Extracts the raw text from the document allowing you to work with the underlying raw text.
*   **OCR:** Convert the image document into a text based PDF. It superimposes invisible ink over the tex making it searchable.

**(Image shows a page from "A MAD TEA-PARTY." with the following text visible):**

The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on
hearing this; but all he said was, "Why is a
raven like a writing-desk?"
"Come, we shall have some fun now!"
thought Alice. "I'm glad they've begun ask-
ing riddles—I believe I can guess that," she
added aloud.
"Do you mean that you think you can find
out the answer to it?" said the March Hare.
"Exactly so," said Alice.

## Slide 41: Simple Contractual Framework

**Simple Contractual Framework**

**Contracting & Liability**

Hermes signs agreements with both the Requestor and the Partner.

*   **Requestors attest** that HIPAA Authorization submissions are valid and accurate.
*   **Partners attest:**
    *   That they have the right to release identified medical data assuming a valid HIPAA Authorization.
    *   That they are releasing the correct data for the patient requested
*   **Hermes Health attests** that patient data is securely handled and transmitted to the appropriate party.

**(Flowchart diagram illustrating the contractual framework):**

| Party         | Attestation                                 | Liability                                  |
| :------------ | :------------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------- |
| **Requestor**   | Attest that HIPAA Authorizations are Valid and Accurate | Holds the Liability for Inappropriate Record Submissions |
| **Hermes Health** | Attest that Patient Data is Secured and transmitted to the appropriate party | Holds the Liability for Inappropriate Record Disclosures |
| **Partner**     | Attest that Records released are for the patient requested | Holds the Liability for Inappropriate Disclosure |

## Slide 42: Solution: How it Works

**Solution: How it Works**

**First Neutral API for Identified Health Data**

The Hermes Health Unity Platform connects Requestors to a growing network of Partners—including ROI vendors, EHR systems, and RWD providers. How it works:

*   **Secure Intake:** Requestors securely submit patient's full name, date of birth, and a signed HIPAA Authorization form.
*   **Smart Routing:** The Unity Platform then routes these requests to our network of Partners.
*   **Partner Fulfillment:** Our Partner networks processes these Requests and securely transmits identified patient data back to the Unity Platform.
*   **Delivery:** The Unity Platform securely delivers the data back to requestors without revealing Partner-specific infrastructure or exposing individual Partner details, protecting privacy, and confidentiality
*   **Transparent Pricing:** Each Partner is paid a clear, per-record/patient fee to keep pricing simple and aligned.
