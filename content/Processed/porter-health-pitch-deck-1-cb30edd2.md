## Slide 5: Why is this important?

**Why is this important?**

**Cardiovascular Disease**
#1
Leading cause of death in the US and the world.[1][2]

**Limited Resources**
60%
Of Cardiologists are 55 and over, [5a] and there are atleast 3K active openings for Cardiologists in the US. [5b]

**Limited Time**
52%
Of the physician's work day is spent on using EHR. [4]

**Physician Burnout**
50%
Prevalence of burnout in physicians in the US. [6]

**Healthcare Data Explosion**
30%
Of the world's data volume is being generated by the healthcare industry. [3]

## Slide 7: Generative AI - making sense of the current noise and hype

**Generative AI - making sense of the current noise and hype**

Most generative AI today is "**low stakes**".
*   Generate an image from text...
*   Compose email...
*   Rewrite resume...

Medicine is **higher criticality**.
*   Every decision comes with consequences including losing trust.

Proprietary and Confidential

## Slide 8: Generative AI for clinical use has specific requirements

**Generative AI for clinical use has specific requirements**

*   The AI needs to be trained on **specialty specific information**, e.g. cardiology textbooks, and journals.
*   To be useful in patient care, **the AI needs to process relevant patient information, found solely in the EHR.**
*   Needs to **meet clinical standards for accuracy.**

## Slide 9: Effective clinical decision support (a true "copilot") has not been possible thus far, because...

**Effective clinical decision support (a true "copilot") has not been possible thus far, because...**

*   **Limited in content** therefore limited in utility.
    *   Not able to be anticipatory.
*   Systems were **rules based** and often **too rigid**.
*   **Not integrated** into clinical workflow and not aligned with bottom-up clinician needs.

**Clinical cognitive challenges tend to be about the following answers...**

**We Don't Know.**
"What causes long Covid?"
**Challenge of research**

**It Depends.**
"Is the heart rate of 38 bpm concerning?"
Is this a change from baseline state of health?
Is the person Michael Phelps?
**Challenge of context**

**I Don't Remember.**
"What is new standard of care for HFrEF?"
4 HF guideline updates in 10 years...most recently April 2022
**Challenge of recall**

## Slide 14: How do clinicians manage these challenges today?

**How do clinicians manage these challenges today?**

*   **Rely on other human beings with knowledge, experience & judgement.**
    *   Fellows and Advanced Practice Professionals (NPs & PAs).
        *   Curate relevant patient contextual information from records.
        *   Offer preliminary treatment recommendations.
*   **Rely on external curated summaries of medical guidance.** e.g. UpToDate

| **Bounded Problem** | Starting with Cardiology allows for a manageable and **feasible approach** to problem solving, and also provides a **solid foundation to scale** to other domains.                                                                  |
| **Guidelines**    | Years of evidence based guidelines across multiple geographies (US, EU, etc.). **Standard of care is well codified.**                                                                                                                    |
| **Uniformity**    | **More uniformity of vocabulary** by clinicians in describing conditions, and treatment, enable data extraction and normalization.                                                                                                    |
| **Structured Data** | **Cardiology data** (EHR, Imaging, etc.) **is well structured** (vs. free-text) that helps enable data extraction and normalization.                                                                                               |
