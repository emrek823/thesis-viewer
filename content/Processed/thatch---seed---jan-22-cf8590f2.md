## Slide 1: THATCH - PRECISION MEDICINE FOR EVERY PATIENT

JANUARY 2022
PRIVILEGED & CONFIDENTIAL

**THATCH**
PRECISION MEDICINE FOR EVERY PATIENT

## Slide 2: THE PROBLEM

THE PROBLEM
Many patients receive suboptimal therapies for their cancer

* Up to 2 million people die every year because they're not getting the most up-to-date therapies
* 5-year survival is 17% lower for individuals without higher education
* African-Americans are up to 2x more likely to die from many types of cancer

## Slide 3: THE SOLUTION

THE SOLUTION
Our software helps patients access precision oncology trials

**Upload your genomic data**
Step 1: Upload PDF of next-generation sequencing report from your physician

**OAuth your medical record**
Step 2: Authorize access to your medical data with a simple OAuth portal

**Enroll in matching clinical trial**
Step 3: View personalized therapies and clinical trials, then enroll with one-click

## Slide 4: TAILWINDS - Why now?

TAILWINDS
Why now?

**21st Century Cures Act**
* Providers and health networks are required to make health data available to patients via APIs
* Regulation is driving the consumerization of healthcare

**Covid-19 accelerated remote medicine**
* McKinsey estimates that telehealth use has increased 38x from the pre-Covid-19 baseline
* $250b of US healthcare spend could be shifted to virtually enabled care

**Similarity to Fintech:**
* Federal rules on consumer-authorized financial data helped Plaid and others flourish in the 2010s

**Statistics:**
* Only 3% participate, yet 70% want to
* 80% trials are delayed due to enrollment issues

## Slide 9: INITIAL MARKET OPPORTUNITY - $35B initial opportunity

INITIAL MARKET OPPORTUNITY
$35B initial opportunity

**Global, Bottom-up Calculation:**
$2,500 (Amount we charge per patient referral)
x 20m (New cases of cancer per year globally)
x 70% (% patients who want to participate in clinical trials)
= **$35B** (Annual Opportunity)

**Global, Top-down Calculation:**
$11B (Pharma spend on oncology clinical trials)
x 40% (% budget spent on patient recruitment)
= **$4.4B** (Annual Spend Today)
