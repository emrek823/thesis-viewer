## Slide 2: Workflow trends are overwhelming health systems

*   Patients forget **85%** of clinical instructions
*   As a result, **1 in 5** patients are readmitted within 30 days at a cost of **$41B** per year
*   **10,000** Boomers turn 65 each day and hospitals are increasingly focused on follow-up to reduce financial penalties
*   Care teams spend an average of **13** follow-up minutes per patient to prevent readmissions, these numbers will inevitably **increase** over time

**Chart: Projected Changes in Medicare Costs and Enrollment**

**Medicare Enrollees (millions of people)**

| Year | Medicare Enrollees (millions of people) |
| :--- | :-------------------------------------- |
| 1975 | 24.9                                    |
| 2013 | 52.3                                    |
| 2040 | 89.2                                    |

**Cost per Enrollee (real dollars)**

| Year | Cost per Enrollee (real dollars) |

| 2013 | $11,400                          |
| 2040 | $31,900                          |

## Slide 3: Demand for follow-up labor is rising, but manual phone calls are expensive

*   Transitional care managers and discharge nurses have reduced readmissions by **30%**, but these efforts are difficult to scale
*   Transitional care FTE salaries account for **15%** of annual health organization budgets (**9% in 2016**)
*   At **$63,741-per-year**, one transitional care FTE reaches an average of just 94 patients in a hospital and 50 in a private practice

**Chart: Average Hospital Revenue vs. Profit Margin**

**Average Hospital Revenue (Millions) - (Blue represents Revenue, Red represents Net Margin)**

| Year | Revenue (Millions) | Net Margin (Millions) |
| :--- | :----------------- | :-------------------- |
| 2011 | ~250               | ~25                   |

*   Hello Jim, please take your prescription of 500 mg of Metformin right now. If you took it, reply 'Y'. If you missed it, reply 'N'.
*   (User input: Y)
*   Keep up the great work! You've taken metformin 22% more often this week and your weekly average blood sugar has dropped by 11 mg/dL.

*   To help you get to your goal weight, let's work towards eating no more than 70 grams of fat per day over the course of this program. This means you'll have to check the food label on the foods you eat, and of course, I'm here to help you keep track.
*   **Fat intake: 90 grams**
*   That's okay, remember to go easy on yourself! Everybody starts slow. You're supposed to be above your goal right now, and we're going to work on it together.
*   **How do I lower fat intake?**
*   There's three main ways to cut down on fat intake: eating high-fat food less often, eating smaller amounts of high-fat foods, and eating lower-fat foods. We'll talk about all three over the next few days.

**Felix features:**

1) Appointment reminders
2) Medication reminders
3) Condition-specific measurement tracking
