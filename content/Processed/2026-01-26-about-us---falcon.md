# About us - Your AI co-analyst for healthcare

At Falcon Health, we're building AI that works alongside healthcare teams as a true analytical partner. We combine deep industry expertise with advanced AI to help organizations understand their data, act faster, and make better decisions.

Founded by a powerhouse team with experience from CMS, successful healthcare startups, and advanced AI research, we bring unmatched insight into the complexities of healthcare operations. Our leadership includes former CMS technical leaders, serial entrepreneurs with multiple successful exits, and pioneers in healthcare AI applications.

What sets us apart is our approach: we've built AI that truly understands healthcare. Generic analytics tools can't navigate Medicare policies, CMS data formats, or the nuances of value-based care. Falcon can.  We've encoded decades of healthcare expertise into AI co-analysts that turn weeks of manual work into hours of intelligent, actionable insights.

We serve health plans, PACE Programs, ACOs, MSOs, medical groups, and RCM companies: anyone who needs to understand their healthcare data better and faster. Our AI delivers professional reports for leadership, smart monitoring for operations, and deep analytics for your experts. We're applying our framework to healthcare one domain at a time, starting with network analytics, claims intelligence, and risk adjustment.
