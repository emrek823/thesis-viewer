# Corporate Development Overview
## Q1 2021

To date, Datavant has made four major corporate development moves -- each aimed at aggressive network expansion. Datavant has spent a total cumulative amount of **$18.6M** on the acquisitions to date, with **$4.8M** reserved for remaining likely earnouts and milestone payments.

### Universal Patient Key:

Universal Patient Key (UPK) was purchased on **April 19th, 2018**. UPK had a similar business model and established a “minimum viable network” for Datavant. The UPK business had **21** paying customers with **$1.8 million** of ARR at the time of the acquisition. Several key employees from UPK joined Datavant, two of whom, Shahir Kassam-Adams and Jason LaBonte, remain as leaders of the company.

The acquisition consisted of an up-front payment of **$3.9 million**, plus **$13.2 million** of cash earnout payments spread over three years (tied primarily to revenue milestones), plus **2.1 million** options granted to former UPK employees. As of **12/31/20**, **$1.8 million** of potential earnouts remain outstanding.

### Health Data Link (HDL):

HDL was a Chicago-based health data linking company spun out of Northwestern that specialized in linking data for academic medical centers, research networks, nonprofit and government sectors. HDL had de-identification and linking technology similar to Datavant’s core offering, and as part of the transaction agreed to migrate everyone to Datavant.

In early **2019**, Datavant won the RFP to link together data across the **70** academic medical centers and research networks that comprise the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Network (PCORnet). We identified the HDL team as exceptionally well-qualified to both manage the relationship and scale our health system and government efforts, and decided to acquihire the business in **May 2019**. Three key team members joined Datavant, including Jake Plummer (CEO; our current Head of Customer Success), Jas Phua (COO; our current head of the Public Sector business); and Abel Kho (Northwestern Professor of Medicine, who is now a Datavant advisor).

The acquisition had two key components: Upfront of up to **$1.85M** to HDL shareholders, contingent on early performance milestones, and Incentive payout of up to **$3M** to HDL team, contingent on performance. The payouts are tied to aggressive targets, including relationships that lead to coverage of **50%** of U.S. hospital admissions, **30%** of VA patients, **15%** of key government healthcare enterprises and initiatives, and up to **20** citable publications. The payments span the three years following the close of the transaction, are capped each year and are back-weighted. In later years, no pro rata payment is made unless certain thresholds are met.

# Prognos

Prognos is an industry-leading lab data aggregator and analytics business. They sell lab data “triggers” into life sciences and are currently scaling their underwriting business for payers.

In June 2019, we acquired OPAL, a de-identification and linking solution built by Prognos to aggregate lab data for its industry-leading lab data analytics platform. Datavant paid $1M upfront for:
1. The value of Prognos’s existing and future data network (10 labs, including LabCorp and Quest; 4 claims sources; and 1 consumer source)
2. The acquisition of OPAL and its underlying code
3. The migration efforts associated with moving the existing sources to the Datavant software.

Additionally, Datavant will pay Prognos a 2x revenue multiple for any revenue that directly comes from their network, capped at $4M.

## Highland Math

Highland Math (“HM”) was a start-up founded in 2018 that enabled companies to understand and realize the value of their internal data assets. HM’s data intelligence platform helped companies grow their investments through data science and data monetization solutions.

On August 11, 2020, Datavant entered into an acquihire agreement with HM and paid $250,000 to HM’s investors and received a perpetual license of HM software. All five Highland Math employees joined Datavant as full-time employees on standard employment contracts. Separately, three of the five individuals have an earnout plan that pays out up to a total of $3 million over three years if certain aggressive revenue targets are achieved.
