> “When we were looking for our next investment partner, we set out to find a firm that was revenue and go-to-market focused. After our first meeting with Stage 2 Capital, my Co-Founder and I were blown away. They were so knowledgable and asked questions we've never been asked before. It was definitely an early indication of how experienced the team is.”
