**Client**
Thank you for meeting with me. I'm interested in learning more about clinical AI solutions. It would be helpful to first get a minute on your background.

**Expert**
I'm a cardiologist. I'm in an academic medical environment. It's a multi-hospital regional system. I've been doing it for about eight years. I work at one of the regional hospitals, and we've started using this technology in the fairly recent past.

**Client**
Can you give us a sense for timing when you evaluated these different tools and when you onboarded Abridge?

**Expert**
We onboarded Abridge maybe four or five months ago and the evaluation was in the months leading up to that.

**Client**
What was the impetus for evaluating Abridge?

**Expert**
I think from a standpoint of increasing physician efficiency, the scribe, the AI, the note-writing. Also, using it to aid in capturing patient complexity, I would say.

**Client**
Was the organization using a tool for medical scribe in the past or was this all done manually or were physicians just typing up their notes?

**Expert**
We had voice recognition software. We were using that. Some physicians still use a transcription, but most of it was just voice recognized software which we still use. I think this is one of those things where this kind of software will continue to phase more in with the AI-generated note-taking, but the voice recognition is still used.

**Client**
What solution for voice recognition software do you use?

**Expert**
We're using Dragon PowerMic.

**Client**
In terms of some of the areas in which voice recognition software was lacking or didn't provide capabilities in versus some of these medical transcription tools, what was that like?

**Expert**
What is it lacking? I think, generally, the language recognition and the accuracy are fairly good. I think a lot of it is just a process of being able to use some of these other solutions that are going to further capture patient complexity, be able to more seamlessly integrate other issues from the patient medical record. Being able to generate a concise note.

When you look at physicians, I don't think I'm alone, documentation is a big part of what we do. We don't generally love doing it, but it takes up a big portion of our day and it's important. I'm not saying it's not important. Being able to spend more of the day doing things that are more important is appealing to a lot of people. Sometimes this boils down to minutes. Spending another five minutes, seven minutes in the room with the patient before the next patient, knowing that the note will be well on its way to being done without the physician having to do it is very appealing.

**Client**
Do you measure in terms of the time savings that physicians were able to benefit from when using a solution like Abridge versus just Nuance?

**Expert**
Yeah. I'm sorry, you were asking the time savings?

**Client**
Yeah.

**Expert**
I think it's pretty variable. I think physicians spend different amounts of time on their notes. I think there's a lot of variables that go into that. Some physicians are very fast. They maybe don't have the same level of detail in their notes than other physicians. I think the variability is wide. I think it's hard to compare.

For myself, I was pretty efficient on both fronts. When you think about a patient encounter on a follow-up as 15-20 minutes, if five of that is documentation, that's 1/4, 1/3 of that one patient encounter that if that is saved, maybe not all of it, but if a large fraction of that time is saved, that compounds into a lot of time saved through the course of the day for 20 patient encounters. You multiply that by weeks and months, it's a lot of time.

**Client**
Got it. I'm curious, in terms of just the use case today for Abridge, what are physicians using Abridge for? Can you walk through the different modules that they're using the solution for?

**Expert**
I think the big ones are clinical documentation. That's a big one that we've been using it for. I think that it provides a wealth of improving patient care and medical accuracy. We're all humans that make mistakes. We're working sometimes fast. I think that those have been probably some of the big selling points, I would say.

**Client**
I know Abridge recently announced functionality within revenue cycle management. Are you using a tool for that today?

**Expert**
For revenue cycle? A billing tool?

**Client**
Essentially adding different codes.

**Expert**
We have started to use that. ICD-10 codes and capturing patient complexity is something that we could probably all do a better job at doing. Especially in the era of bundled payments, I think that a lot of times, including our hospital, we're leaving a lot of money on the table. This is allowing us to be better reimbursed for the level of medical decision-making and complex decision-making that we're making. Previously, due to just being rushed through our workday, not accurately capturing the really complex ICD-10 level codes and complexities of patients, we just didn't necessarily have the attention to that detail. I think that was costing us revenue.

**Client**
As in sometimes just due to human error, the incorrect billing codes would be entered in?

**Expert**
I don't know if I would go so far as to say it was incorrect. I don't think we were misdiagnosing. As a physician, I may not have a diagnosis yet. I may have that the patient has shortness of breath, and that's not a diagnosis, that's a symptom. In the context of what the patient's comorbidities are, and maybe they have known coronary disease, I think it just paints a much more, the billing codes that we capture can broaden and better paint the picture of this could be a patient that has a lot of different potential etiologies for their shortness of breath, for example, or a patient with just coronary disease. There are lots of qualifiers that we have to go into.

I don't think it's physician inattention to detail as much. We use Epic as an electronic medical record. It's death by a thousand clicks where you have to click a diagnosis and sometimes up to 10 qualifiers for what is further qualifying that diagnosis. Sometimes we don't click them. Sometimes we say unspecified. I think that is costing revenue. It's just lack of time. It's just, am I going to spend the next 30 seconds of my day clicking on buttons?

It's one of those things where us as physicians, that many who are now hospital employees, it's more of a "Yes, it's affecting the hospital's bottom line rather than our personal one." I don't think it's taking away from patient care, but I think it's taking away from hospitals appropriately recouping the revenue, if that makes sense.

**Client**
Yeah. Do you have a sense of just the accuracy of the revenue cycle management solution for Abridge? Are they able to identify the correct diagnosis and offer some of that granularity?

**Expert**
I think it's been able to. I don't think I've seen some of the data to suggest how much better we are in the last four or five months with this solution compared to previous. I'm certain that it's been beneficial from a revenue standpoint, from a capturing patient complexity and accuracy standpoint. I just don't know if I can quantify how much that is.

**Client**
Got it. That's helpful. Just going back to the point on Nuance. For Nuance, do they offer transcription as well? Was it just not as accurate, what you had mentioned, it doesn't integrate with patient information? Does it not offer integrations with other tools? Can you talk through what the pain points were there?

**Expert**
I'll say it's accurate. I think language detection and processing, especially for complex medical jargon, is very good. When we're trying to save minutes per patient encounter that does add up, Nuance still requires me after I'm in the room with a patient and I've had a conversation to circle back outside of the room and to indirectly have that conversation again for the purposes of documentation. It's a little bit redundant. I think that something like Abridge has allowed us to not have to be redundant in after a patient encounter, redoing that patient encounter for the purposes of documentation. The patient encounter serves as both. I think that saves time.

Nuance and PowerMic, I think it's still a very useful tool. For situations where maybe I'm still documenting a telephone encounter and maybe I'm not always exactly using Abridge for saving a brief patient telephone encounter, I could. It still does serve a supportive role. It's a process of opening a note, populating a note, adjusting physical exam and objective data findings, testing, stress testing, cardiac testing into the note, whereas Abridge does a lot of that. It's not hard and it doesn't take particularly long. Compounded over many patient encounters, it adds up. I think makes slight alleviations in the stress points for each patient encounter that cumulatively adds up.

**Client**
In terms of some of the data that Nuance would not capture, am I hearing you correctly, some of the quantitative data that they're not able to capture?

**Expert**
Quantitative data, Nuance is not integrated into the electronic health record per se, in that it's not able to pull pieces of data automatically from the medical record to integrate it into the patient chart or the patient clinical note. That's something that has to generally be done manually. Electronic medical records like Epic have certainly streamlined that as well. I think a lot of these things we're talking about is highly dependent on the user. Highly dependent on user efficiency, how good they are using the system.

I'll use an example of a doctor who is 25 or 30 years old is going to be very well versed in utilizing all this and streamlining their daily process, as opposed to the physician who is 70 years old. Now, I'm not saying all 70-year-olds are less efficient, but it's just, for a physician who has been more around this kind of technology, they're just much more facile with the information, whereas something like Abridge can literally bridge some of those gaps where that maybe older physician would stand to benefit far greater from this kind of solution in that it's going to automatically do a lot of it for them. Does that make sense?

**Client**
It sounds like for creating the patient medical note, Abridge is able to pull in some of those medical records that's stored elsewhere and then instead of the physician having to type up some of the medical record, it just automatically does that.

**Expert**
Exactly.

**Client**
When you were evaluating Abridge, did you look at any of the other solutions like Ambience or DeepScribe, such vendors that you did compare?

**Expert**
We did. We looked at Ambience, we looked at Nuance, DeepScribe. To varying levels, we explored all these. I'm just looking at the ones you were asked. Suki we looked at. Yeah, we did. I think to probably answer your next question, how they compare, they're like small little nuances in terms of how the note is generating, how the language is used, how the style of the note is written, how some of the medical decision-making is generated. They're all little differences.

**Client**
How come in terms of accuracy, did you notice that there was one that stood out based on accuracy and just ability to capture the patient physician conversation?

**Expert**
I would say it's not accurate versus inaccurate. It's maybe levels of detail. It's maybe to a certain extent some of those qualifiers. I think some of these generative note writers, they're very cautious on. Again, in the world of current medical billing where specificity is highly desired, the notes that are generated are not necessarily highly specific in terms of offering a very specific differential diagnosis or a diagnosis for the patient. Oftentimes, in medicine it's sometimes very hard to do that.

We could say a patient has coronary artery disease, but saying they have coronary artery disease with a type A lesion at the right coronary artery, at the proximal right coronary. Sometimes we can't go to that level of detail because we just don't have the further diagnostics. Some of these generative AI software solutions I think maybe leave a little something to be desired in terms of how generic they are in terms of differentials offered and medical decision making offered. I don't think that's a bad thing. I think that's just a limitation of not wanting to venture too far into the specificity of what it requires.

**Client**
Specifically for Ambience, any sense for just where they fell short? Can you talk through pricing, accuracy, overall experience of the solution versus Abridge?

**Expert**
I think that Ambience was good. I think that these are probably two of the more leading solutions, I would say, of what we considered. The price point, without hard numbers, I was going to say, I think it came in at probably 10% or 15% higher than what we're currently paying. I think there were a few little issues with streamlining in terms of how it was integrating into our electronic medical record. I think there were a few hitches there that gave us a little bit of pause.

We wanted to find a solution that wasn't going to cause an incredibly steep learning curve where we were going to lose some ground in two to six weeks. I think that that was something that we felt was going to cost us a little bit in terms of the rollout.

**Client**
In terms of the EMR integration, is this what you had mentioned before in terms of just their ability to pull in the medical records into the patient notes?

**Expert**
Exactly, yep. What that relies on is it's relying on the software's ability to go into some patients' very extensive medical records and be able to pull things that us as doctors would otherwise have to do manually. Some of these patient records are very, very long. For the sake of time, we don't have the ability to manually go over all this. The more informative those solutions are at accurately polling previous diagnoses outside records is very valuable.

**Client**
If Ambience was, say, just the same price as Abridge, would you have chosen Ambience?

**Expert**
I think it's very possible. I think some of the integration and the rollout limitations probably would have given us a little bit of pause as well. I'm certainly to be open. There are lots of new exciting things in medicine that we all want to consider, but we do need to be fiscally conscientious with some of these. We would have certainly considered it. Price is certainly a big consideration when we're looking at a lot of these solutions.

**Client**
Is the rollout consideration unique to Ambience, or just in general for the medical scribe solutions?

**Expert**
There's certainly a rollout and an integration period with all these regardless. We're looking for the relative, most seamless one that can be offered. There were certainly differences in terms of the expectation and the time that we would expect for that to be fully complete.

**Client**
How about if Ambience was 10%-15% cheaper than average, would that change your decision?

**Expert**
It would have given it a fighting chance, I will say. I cannot say with 100% certainty we would have adopted it, but they would have been much more likely.

**Client**
When you're evaluating these different solutions across accuracy, integrations, price versus peers, what criteria is most important and what are you trying to optimize for?

**Expert**
I would say globally, we want these solutions to lessen some of the burden on physician chart review, physician documentation. Again, we're humans, we're reading things. We're always crunched for time inaccuracy. We want to minimize and have this be a bridge to limiting medical errors, limiting missing something. We want to have this as a supportive tool that saves us time for medical legal documentation.

Another big one that we found very helpful is, as a doctor and I'm seeing a new patient or I'm seeing a follow-up patient, I have to go back and review the chart again to see what has happened with that patient since I saw them six months ago. Did they have a big surgery? Were they hospitalized?

**Client**
This gives us very good supportive tools for quickly preparing an agenda to discuss with the patient. I don't feel like I'm walking in the room and the patient tells me something that I should have from the record, but I didn't have time to review. Does that make sense? It's a time-saving tool. It's an efficiency enhancer. It's limiting mistakes and errors. It's capturing patient complexity to capture further revenue.

**Expert**
Do the EMR systems offer any of this you were talking about just summaries of changes in patient's medical history in between visits? Do they offer any of these capabilities?

**Client**
You mean the actual electronic medical record provider, like Epic, for example?

**Expert**
Yeah.

**Client**
They're starting to. I think Epic and a lot of these, probably bigger ones, maybe Cerner, I don't actually know, are starting to offer their own proprietary software. As you know, there's a crowded field out there. I think the answer is eventually in the near future, yes, they will be.

**Client**
From a physician's perspective, do you have any sense for time that they're spending on Abridge versus Epic and how that's changed since you've adopted a solution?

**Expert**
I think the idea is that we're not spending a lot of time on Abridge per se, we're using it. I think that we're spending relatively less time on Epic, versus we're transferring some of that time spent on Epic to maybe other tasks, I might say. I'm still on Epic all day.

I'm still spending a lot of time and it's hard to really say, am I on a specific patient encounter in their chart less? Yes, I am, but I may be doing other things like my inbox or reading other tests, or doing other study interpretations. Again, even those minutes here and there are just cumulatively adding up to letting me spend it on other things because we all do lots of multitasking on a daily basis.

**Client**
It sounds like from a physician's perspective, Abridge could almost be thought of as a set it and forget it type of solution. It's running in the background, it's improving.

**Expert**
I'd say that's fair to say.

**Client**
The bulk of the time from just a technology standpoint is still being spent on the core EMR system, which in this case is Epic.

**Expert**
Correct. Just within lots of other different areas within Epic, rather than patient A, or patient B medical record were on some other part of the chart or some other part of the medical record.

**Client**
Got it. I'm curious, going back to the evaluation process, can you talk about which stakeholders were involved? Were there physician perspectives? Were there admin groups involved? Who were the core decision makers in the process?

**Expert**
Our chief information officer, who's our technology officer, our chief medical officer, myself was, and then we had some of our Epic representatives as well. A lot of this has to do with how we roll this out. This hasn't been a complete region-wide rollout that we've done. I think the eventual goal would be to have this provided at most of our hospitals as we use this.

If the numbers continue to support it, the physicians are happy, there's improvement in documentation, if a lot of these metrics are being met, at some point when we look at this in the future, I think our plan is to look at it in six to eight months to continue moving forward with it. I think this will continue to be a software that will improve and evolve as well.

**Client**
In terms of just the rollout and deployment so far, can you give us a sense of how many, be it physicians or site locations have Abridge rolled out and what is the deployment plan for the next six to eight months?

**Expert**
We have one site, it's one of our regional hospitals that we have this rolled out and it's really just one of our departments, to be honest. It's cardiology. I think there are 12 of us maybe using it. This is certainly something that I can speak of within our hospital. Part of the bigger group leadership decision for how much more this is going to extend into a regional decision, I don't know that that's been determined yet. There would have to continue to be an appealing cost-benefit analysis there.

**Client**
For the people who were involved in the evaluation process, were they specific to your regional hospital or was this representing?

**Expert**
Yeah, they're specific to the region for right now, to the current hospital system.

**Client**
Do you have a sense of any of the other regional hospitals are evaluating medical scribe solutions?

**Expert**
It is being explored. I don't know at what point they are in that evaluation, but yes.

**Client**
Has your regional hospital provided any input to the other regional hospitals on your evaluation?

**Expert**
Yeah. There has been some anecdotal experience that we have provided. We have not given a really true, detailed objective assessments. They may be holding out until some of that information comes out, but it is certainly being explored at lots of different levels.

**Client**
You may have mentioned this before, but how many regional hospitals are there in total within the overall organization?

**Expert**
Within our hospital, within our region, I think there are eight.

**Client**
Regional hospitals. All right. In terms of for the 12 people who are using it today, is that the entire cardiology department? Are there additional physicians who are not using Abridge yet?

**Expert**
There are some who aren't using it yet. I think they've been slow adopters. We're not mandating this to be used, but I think the hope is to continue to grow this if the appeal is found. There are some in medicine who have set in their ways of doing things. With some, there's been a bit slow adoption. Again, we're not mandating this for anyone.

**Client**
Would you say that applies to medical scribe solutions in general? Do those individuals use Nuance?

**Expert**
Do they use Nuance? Yes, they do. I can't speak for all the physicians. I think some physicians still certainly use Nuance. I think there may be a couple. There may be some physicians that maybe still use an actual transcription service. That's pretty rare these days, I'll be honest. I could say I wouldn't be surprised if there's a few of the older generation that are using some of those.

**Client**
For those transcription services, what providers are they using?

**Expert**
It's a good question. I can't say I know the name, to be honest.

**Client**
In terms of the overall cardiology department, how many physicians are there in total?

**Expert**
Within our region or within our hospital?

**Client**
Within your hospital?

**Expert**
Within our hospital, there's probably 20. Two thirds are using this. Within the region, I honestly don't have a number for the number of staff cardiologists we have.

**Client**
Just based off of feedback from the other physicians so far, do you anticipate that adoption rate to change moving forward?

**Expert**
Yes, I do. I think it will continue to grow. I can't say I know at what velocity or the speed at which that will grow, but I think it definitely will continue to grow.

**Client**
In terms of some of the constructive feedback so far, from a physician's standpoint, has there been anything raised on physician's experience with the solution?

**Expert**
When you're having an encounter with a patient and this is being recorded with the idea of generating a document, there are lots of non-medical, non-clinical things that are discussed. I would say, generally, it's been very good at sifting through some of that. We want to keep the medical record accurate, relevant, concise. I would say the vast majority of time that is the case. Sometimes there are some things from the conversation that perhaps slip in that is not inaccurate, but it's just maybe a little bit superfluous, I would say.

**Client**
It's able to weed out some of the information that's not relevant to people.

**Expert**
Right, Exactly.

**Client**
In terms of just accuracy, I know I have asked this, but for Abridge versus some of its peers, in terms of how accurately they are able to capture the nature of the conversation, is there a clear winner so far, from your experience, evaluating these different solutions, from just an accuracy standpoint?

**Expert**
I think that probably Ambience or Abridge, I would say it's perhaps slightly more. Those are probably the slight two leaders, but again, a lot of these questions are slight shades of gray. I would say probably those two slightly more than the others, not to say that the others are inaccurate per se.

**Client**
Did you get a chance to speak with the teams at Ambience and Abridge to just understand from platform perspective, from the tech, what's under the hood, how they're able to build out some of those capabilities?

**Expert**
Not necessarily from a nuts and bolts standpoint. I think they've certainly solicited our advice for, in terms of what things we like and dislike and improvements. I think in terms of when it comes to really popping the hood and knowing how this works, I can't say I have a lot of detail.

**Client**
Got it. It sounds like Ambience Healthcare and Abridge are the leaders within the space from your perspective. In general, it sounds like it is a great area just given patient physician conversations are nuanced and the different solutions capture. I guess it's more of a style difference in terms of how they capture.

**Expert**
There is some difference, absolutely in style. I think that captures it fairly good. It's not accurate or inaccurate per se. It's style, it's format. It's the optics and some of the appearance.

**Client**
In terms of ROI for Abridge, can you talk through how you measure cost savings within the organization?

**Expert**
I think this tool is certainly not intended to save a physician an hour a day so that they can see three or four more patients necessarily. I think it's to help preserve and maintain physician efficiency, decrease some of the less important workload, decrease burnout, letting physicians work at the top of their license. I think all of those things are going to translate into ROI. I think in terms of how much we expect to see, I don't know. We want to keep good physicians happy and continuing to feel like their skill set is utilized and not having them do less necessary tasks, I guess I would say.

I think it's also the hope is by seeing patient A, being able to better capture their complexity, that can lead to higher billing than we otherwise would have done without this solution. I think all of those things combined, we expect this to certainly give us a generous return. It's a matter of how much which will dictate how much more we expand and adopt this throughout the hospital.

**Client**
Are there professionals outside of the physicians, I'm just thinking through, for example, like on the billing code side, would you be able to decrease headcount per se for some of the folks who are in charge of putting in some of those billing codes? Are there any efficiency gains from just a headcount perspective you'd be able to recognize after adopting Abridge?

**Expert**
I think that is the hope. That's certainly a big element of our payroll. I think that would be some hope down the road to be able to do as well. The answer is yes. How much so? Hard to say.

**Client**
Who would those personas be?

**Expert**
It would be our director of billing and coding, some of the more supervisory roles. Some of that falls under the chief information officer.

**Client**
Got it. Just thinking through in terms of some of the other incumbents, a solution such as Epic, do you see them as complementary to Abridge? Do you see them becoming more competitive? As you had mentioned, they're building out some of these summary functionality.

**Expert**
Yeah, I see them ultimately offering their own solution.

**Client**
Offering their own solution for transcription and summaries?

**Expert**
Generative AI, scribe, complex coding. I see all of those things increasing.

**Client**
Have they announced anything in the product roadmap aside from the summary features?

**Expert**
Not to the best of my knowledge. As far as I know, I haven't heard of any explicit rollout yet, no.

**Client**
For a solution like Nuance, are they making inroads in this space?

**Expert**
Are they looking to roll into that space?

**Client**
For Nuance, are they offering capabilities that would be competitive to Abridge?

**Expert**
I don't know that that's necessarily a big focus for them right now. I can't definitively speak about that either. I just think that there are probably bigger solutions they're working on. Maybe they are, but I don't know.

**Client**
If they were to decrease their price, do you think that would impact your decision-making process of how you allocate budget to these different tools?

**Expert**
For which one? For Nuance?

**Client**
Yes.

**Expert**
I don't know. It would have to be far more than the voice recognition software that they offer right now. Some of these AI softwares would have to be embedded into it as well. I think if that is what they're working on, which, generally looking at where this landscape is moving, it would behoove them to do that. Yeah, we would certainly entertain it.

**Client**
Got it. Just curious, in terms of order of priority of these solutions, when you think of a solution like Epic, Nuance and Abridge and other software that you're spending money on, how do you rank where Abridge is from a priority standpoint compared to these other tools?

**Expert**
The electronic medical record itself certainly has a much higher priority. I think that this is a very important tool that will continue to be more and more important. It is an improvement on efficiency at this point. I would say it's not near the top, generally speaking. I think it will continue to garner more attention and importance, if that makes sense. I think for the time being, it's important.

I'm not going to call it a luxury item, but I think it is important in terms of taking some of the clinical and administrative burden off of physicians, improving their confidence and minimizing medical errors and mistakes and taking some of the burden off documentation, which we all become the bane of our existence sometimes.

**Client**
Would you say in terms of Abridge is a nice-to-have solution or a must-have solution?

**Expert**
For right now, it's nice to have. We'll certainly continue to increase on its necessity over time, I would be willing to say.

**Client**
Would they have to offer anything additional from a product standpoint in order to be more sticky within the organization and be an essential tool?

**Expert**
I think it's just one of those things that it's offering an improvement on something that we're already doing. I think that there will continue to be a school of thought and a group of people that want to continue with the current solutions they have. I think that, like a lot of change, it will be a slow-moving change that will, as it's ushered into physician training programs, nurse training programs, mid-level provider training programs, become the standard. I don't know how quickly that will happen, but I anticipate that it could eventually start to become the standard.

**Client**
It sounds like you just want to see more adoption data, see how physicians are actually using it first.

**Expert**
I think so, yeah.

**Client**
Did you get a chance to evaluate Abridge's ability to go into other specialties outside of cardiology?

**Expert**
I did. I can't say I can confidently comment on how well it did that. Unfortunately not.

**Client**
Thanks for your time. Have a great day.
