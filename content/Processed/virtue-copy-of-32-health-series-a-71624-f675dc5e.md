## Slide 4: Opportunity: Dental insurance is a $150B+ market built on an antiquated tech stack & manual workflows

**Confidential & Proprietary**
**32HEALTH**

*   **2024E US Dental Service Spend:** $156B
*   **6.8% CAGR**
*   **2030E US Dental Service Spend:** $216B

**Key Statistic:** ~17% ($5.1 pmpm) of every dental premium ($30 pmpm) spent on admin expenses due to antiquated tech, manual workflows & low electronic adoption

## Slide 5: Why Now: Dental insurers must automate back-end tasks to improve margins due to recent regulatory pressures & market dynamics

**Confidential & Proprietary**
**32HEALTH**

**Regulatory & Market Pressures are Forcing Automation...**

*   **Impending Mandated Dental Loss Ratios**
    *   As of 2025 in Mass, >83% of premium must go to care (vs.70% typically). Other states are expected to emulate as happened with medical. This would require payers to cut admin expenses to maintain margins while continuing to offer competitive premiums and benefits offerings.
*   **Competitive Dental Plans Required to Win Growing Market Share**
    *   88% of Americans have dental insurance and >90% of MA plans (50M members) offer a dental benefit. Insurers (e.g., CVS/Aetna, Humana) are forced to reduce admin costs for dental benefits to continue to offer competitive benefits to attract members who see dental as a differentiator (#2 benefit after medical).
*   **Value-Based Care Requires More Comprehensive Benefits Integration**
    *   Medical-dental integration is starting to show effective outcomes (Kaiser, BCBS), driving adoption of more complex plan design and increased spend on manual admin resources.

**...But Carriers/DSOs Struggle to Build or Buy AI Solutions**

*   **Carriers / DSOs Are Actively Looking for AI Solutions**
    *   Insurers and providers have historically leveraged AI/ML for image analysis (~20% of claims require image analysis) but now want to leverage advances in LLMs to impact the other 80% of claims/interactions.
*   **Build: Customers Don't Have Human Capital to Build Internally**
    *   Carriers/DSOs fundamentally cannot build product internally because they are unable to attract engineering talent required to implement novel technology solutions, especially AI. <1% of dental insurance organizations have built internal team for AI initiatives.
*   **Buy: Existing Vendors Lack Dental AND AI Expertise**
    *   Existing dental specific platforms are antiquated, cumbersome and costly, (>$100M over 5 years per payer), while more general insuretech platforms aren't purpose built for dental - resulting in lower accuracy/automation for dental workflows.

## Slide 43: Why Now: Dental insurers must automate back-end tasks to improve margins due to recent regulatory pressure & competitive dynamics

**Confidential & Proprietary**
**32HEALTH**

**Impending Mandated Dental Loss Ratios**
As of 2025 in Mass, >83% of premium must go to care (vs.70% typically). Other states are expected to emulate as happened with medical. This would require payers to cut admin expenses to maintain margins while continuing to offer competitive premiums and benefits offerings.

**Competitive Dental Plans Required to Win Growing Market Share**
57% of Americans have commercial dental insurance and >90% of MA plans (50M members) offer a dental benefit. Insurers (e.g., CVS/Aetna, Humana) are forced to reduce admin costs for dental benefits to continue to offer competitive benefits to attract members who see dental as a differentiator (#2 benefit after medical).

**Value-Based Care Requires More Comprehensive Benefits Integration**
Medical-dental integration is starting to show effective outcomes (Kaiser, BCBS), driving adoption of more complex plan design and increased spend on manual admin resources.

**Carrier / DSO ICP: Must Buy Externally (vs Build Internally)**
Service business unable to build own product; cannot attract top engineering talent; ICP using legacy tech

**Tech exists today aka 'AI / Gen AI' that hasn't previously existed / been utilized**
Ability to train / fine-tune dental-specific AI models not yet implemented in the dental carrier / DSO market...
