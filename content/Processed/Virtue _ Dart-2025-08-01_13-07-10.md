### Dart’s Strategic Decision-Making: “Patience + Taste” Philosophy

- Patience: Able to say no to many opportunities - super important because this is where many startups fail
- Constantly taught (through YC) to listen heavily to customers, but Dart made a point not to
- Personal insight from growing up in healthcare family
	- Dad believed system wouldn’t get fixed - “disappointed, it’s not meant to get fixed and you’re just going to burn all this money and crash”
	- Winning strategy: don’t listen to customers directly, but spend time understanding their fears, issues, and root cause problems

### Major “No” Decision Examples

- Tenor/Wheelchair Company Case (1.5 years ago)
	- Developed strong relationship with what would be Tenor’s largest customer contract (huge wheelchair company)
	- CEO wanted Dart to solve fax/referrals problem - would have given $1M ARR for few months work
	- Hard to say no with only $70K in the bank
	- Root cause analysis: In most optimistic world (tech free, everyone built best solutions), what problems actually exist?
		- Fax was symptom, not root cause
		- Real issue: 85-year-old EHR CEO’s desire not to move away from fax and old EHR system
		- Artificial problem vs. real healthcare problem
	- Real problems are hard and take longer than simple solutions
	- Customer ultimately didn’t move forward with Tenor either, became more forward-thinking, built small engineering department
- Home Health/Hospice QA Competitors
	- Competitors made poor product decisions going after specific QA use case only
	- Would either become EHR or something EHRs would eventually eat
	- Example: Infection reports for home health/hospice
		- Could get extra $10-15K ARR from each customer
		- Purposely said no while competitors dove deeper
		- EHRs have the data about infections - just few more days engineering work to add report

### Veeraj’s Background

- Grew up in Cerritos, SoCal (between OC and LA County)
- Family members all got into Whitney (top high school in US), but Veeraj didn’t due to alphabetical order processing
- Started working on various projects in high school instead of focusing on academics
	- Climate work initially
	- Product consulting studio with Okra
	- Goal: get out of school, work on things that gave deep satisfaction with large output

### Major Early Achievement: Dad’s Pharmacy Transformation

- Independent pharmacies typically make little profit ($25-30K/year after expenses)
- Ages 15-17: Transformed dad’s pharmacy from $95K to $250K annual salary
- Three key changes:
	- Culture/Hiring: Pay $3-4/hour more than CVS, hire better people who cared about patients
		- Hired Crystal who changed how people talked about pharmacy in city
		- People would quit CVS to come there, happy to pay more
	- Becoming Care Provider: Instead of just reselling medications, started managing patient care
		- $20 consultations for diabetes, obesity, wellness
		- Pharmacist expertise used for actual care vs. retail management
	- Revenue/Space Optimization: Redesigned layout
		- Pushed pills to back, created comfortable space for IVs, vitamins
		- Became most comfortable place in city to get care
		- People call/text constantly, trust him first before doctors
- Results: Increased from max 2 to 4 full-time employees, became residency site for USC/Chapman pharmacy students
- Family able to travel (Europe, China, Hawaii), dad bought big house, brother attended USC

### Technical Architecture Deep Dive

- Data Integration & Processing
	- Integration layer (RPA, OCR, other feeds)
	- Filtering/organization layer depending on data feed type
	- Patient profile creation with clear labeling (care plans, dates, providers, content)
- Relational Architecture
	- Mini network for patient profiles connecting all elements by date, time, care provider
	- Gives LLMs full ability to understand relationships between contexts
	- Enables models to find relevant medication lists for specific care plans
	- Timeline view like physicians see records
- Analysis Pipeline
	- Multiple transformation and filter options: ML pipelines, standard filtering, embedding classifications
	- Embedding classifications are “pretty big deal” and where magic comes from
	- LLM review comes after proper data feed established
	- Rules setup: Natural language prompts with dozens of attached tools
		- Example: Wound care knowledge base attached to rules instead of allowing Google searches
	- Nothing is open-ended in system - forces answers to yes/no/not applicable
- Actions & Feedback Loop
	- Multiple action types: SMS, generating documentation, notifying clinicians
	- Threshold settings (e.g., 70% or less triggers automatic care manager notification)
	- Judge model evaluates feedback, runs reinforcement learning process
	- Retrains models or provides additional context to avoid future issues

### Malnutrition Use Case Example

- Problem with Existing Approaches
	- ML pipelines alone create false positives (surgery/cancer patients with muscle loss aren’t malnutrition cases)
	- LLMs alone too expensive and slow for large patient populations
- Dart’s Solution
	- Embeddings model classifies patients by malnutrition risk (high/medium/low) using similarity scores
	- Feed filtered results to LLM with customer-defined rules
	- Auto-remove false positives while providing context and evidence for registered dietitians
	- RDs can quickly review with traceability vs. unexplainable ML outputs
	- Generate care plans and other documentation as actions

### Next Steps

- Follow-up meeting scheduled for 5:00 PM Eastern today
- Veeraj to provide additional architecture screenshots and documentation
- Continue technical deep dive with live demo and Q&A
