## Investment Overview

Faro Health is a life sciences software platform that is developing digital infrastructure for smart clinical trials, creating a new layer in the SW stack above Veeva & Medidata. By replacing flat Word documents with comprehensive data schemas, Faro enables connected, intelligent clinical trials.

We were introduced to Scott Chetham (CEO) by Quentin, who has been cultivating a relationship in the SW ecosystem that sent Faro our way. Quentin was impressed by Scott and his prior experience at Verily and Intersection Medical. Faro was also flagged as a "star" in Polaris' portfolio through a separate connection. Jen Goldsmith (President of Tendo, former SVP of Veeva/Vault) joined Faro as an advisor last year, a meaningful vote of confidence in Scott and accelerant to the platform. Ken Frazier also referenced Faro with Andy Lee, who leads clinical operations globally with 5,000 reports under him, and received positive feedback.

Over the past two quarters, Faro has received significant inbound interest, which prompted Scott to selectively explore a Series A' raise. Scott received a term sheet last week but indicated that he and the Board would prefer to partner with a more sophisticated investor like GC, which has accelerated our process. He also asked Elena to join the board, which we view as a vote of confidence in the GC ecosystem value-add.

Faro has executed on all product development milestones on or ahead of plan, and is in the early stages of commercialization ($465K in 2022 pilot revenue, forecasting $4.8M in 2023 based on conversion of major enterprise accounts). Feedback from Roche and Merck on the initial product is impressive. Scott's aim is to be heads down in operations for 2023 and 2024 to focus on a) achieving his near-term product roadmap which drives TAM expansion, b) focus on executing implementation with his marquee customers, and c) start to ramp his commercial team to unlock growth across customer segments.

We are seeking the Committee's approval to invest up to $7M of an up to $12M round at a $60M pre-money valuation (with ability to flex up to $70M if needed). If successful, we would expect to do a substantial or leading check in the Series B out of Fund XII-Endurance. Depending on fund timing, it would be prudent to reserve $5M to maintain ownership in a Series B if it comes up prior to Fund XII close. Due to strong insider demand, Scott indicated that there would be $5M available for GC, though we are pushing for at least $7M to get us to closer to 10% ownership. He also indicated that he'd discuss with his board upsizing from the target round size of $10M to $12M to get us there, and/or reducing insider allocations. Thus we are proposing putting in a term sheet that reflects $7M for GC as part of an upsized $12M round, after we complete the final 1-2 customer calls. Pro-forma for the Series A', GC would own 9.3% of FDSO after an ESOP top-up to 8% (current pool is ~5% of current capitalization). The $12M round would extend runway from 11 months to 30 months post-close (monthly burn increasing from $500K → $650K).

## Thesis for why we we believe this is a compelling investment opportunity includes:

*   **Market Overview:** The clinical trial sector is heavily pen and paper, and services are delivered in a cost plus structure that does not incentivize quality or efficiency. Existing SW players Veeva and Medidata are dominant and sticky, forming the base layer of the clinical trial stack, a $4-6B+ market. The $30-40B+ TAM of contract research organizations (CROs) is an inefficient service business. Companies like Vial seek to transform the sector by building an integrated SW + Service solution that tackles the CRO segment. Faro is creating a new layer in the SW stack that will sit between Veeva/Medidata and services delivery, which we see as a near-term ~$1B SAM, and is not competitive with Kyra, Vial, Triomics.
*   **Conviction in Market Opportunity:** This is fundamentally a "market creation" play given there is no competition. Faro is creating a new market for digital protocol design, protocol collaboration, and automation of programming the protocol into the base layer of the SW stack (e.g. Veeva, Medidata). Transcelerate (a non-competitive consortium of top biopharma sponsors) launched the Digital Data Flow initiative in 2020, which has created the market for us with pent-up demand from pharma's who know they cannot achieve this on their own. This has unlocked a ~$400-800M SAM for its core Protocol Designer product. As Faro executes on its product roadmap, we think it can deliver an enhanced value proposition to sponsors by further driving efficiency across the clinical trial workflow and improving quality (additional $400M SAM). At scale, Faro could access the $6B TAM of R&D software that has been dominated by Veeva/Medidata today
*   **Distinctive Management Team:** We view Scott as an A+ leader who has been referenced as an all-star across strategy, product, commercial, and execution. He has the perfect experience for this role given he directly managed the development of 100+ clinical trial protocols as Head of Clin Ops at Verily. Furthermore, he has a track record of meeting (and beating) key milestones he has set with the board. He is also joined by Ross Jaffe as his co-founder, who has had a prolific career in VC as the Co-Founder and MD of Versant Ventures ($4.2B AUM life sciences fund with 76 exits).
*   **Best-in-Class Product:** After an extensive product demo from the team and customer conversations, we believe this is a "10x product" across all dimensions. The incumbent workflow is using MS Word and email communications, which results in significant opportunities for improved efficiency. Even withstanding deficiencies of the current workflow, it is clear that the product design and UI/UX is aligned with the voice of the customer. Faro has also been touted as having the leading product within the Digital Data Flow segment by Transcelerate.
*   **Attractive Business Model:** At maturity, Faro would operate as a verticalized SaaS company with ~80% gross margin, ~40% EBITDA margins and ~25-30% FCF margins. Given the attractiveness of the margin profile, HC SaaS comps trade at a significant premium (~10x NTM Revenue) vs. other companies within the broader healthcare industry.
*   **Appealing Returns Profile:** Our returns analysis suggests a ~11x MoM / 41% IRR for our Series A' investment at a $60M pre-money valuation (and ~10x MoM / 39% IRR at a $70M pre-money valuation). This assumes an 12/31/2029 exit, 35-40% future dilution, and a 10.0x TEV / NTM Revenue multiple based on a broad set of public SaaS (HC and non-HC) comps.

## Company Overview

### Company History

Faro Health was co-founded by Scott Chetham (CEO) and Ross Jaffe (Chairman) in 2019. Given Scott's direct experience managing the development of 100+ clinical trial protocols and Ross' portfolio of life science investments, they both set out to transform protocol design, an aspect of clinical trial workflow that had not yet seen innovation. Throughout 2019, Faro validated the market opportunity, clarifying the value proposition for biopharma sponsors. Faro then spent 2020 and 2021 building out their MVP product (Study Designer), which they then used to secure their first revenue-generating customer (Ionis). Initial commercialization efforts with a pay per-user seat model did not generate the level of foundational customer engagement desired and did not generate substantial revenue in the target timeline, so after a brief effort with that model, Faro transitioned to an enterprise sales mode. Today, the company has closed 5 contracts, and is looking to continue investment into the 2nd generation of product, which will unlock sizable TAM, accelerate commercial efforts, and execute on implementation milestones. Thus, the company is looking to raise a modest Series A' round to extend runway through the end of 2024 and focus on operations in the near-term.

### Financing History

The company has raised $18.3M in institutional capital to date. The company initially raised $3.3M of Seed capital in August 2019, where the round was co-led by Polaris and Zetta. Subsequently, the company then raised $15M of Series A capital in June 2021, where the round was led by Section 32 with participation from Polaris, Zetta, and Northpond at a $45M post-money. The company forecasts ending 2022 with $7.5M of cash. Based on their current monthly burn of ~$500K/month, this implies 15 months of runway pre-close / 39 months post-close. Given they plan to ramp OpEx, their forecasted monthly burn of $650K implies 11 months of runway pre-close / 30 months post-close.

### Core Value Proposition

Clinical trial protocols are the core of clinical development, linking to all aspects of R&D including Study Operations, Regulatory, Biometrics, Medical Affairs, Budgeting, Supply Chain, etc. Clinical trial complexity has continued to mount – the average # of procedures has doubled since 2005, and the average trial produces 10,000 documents. At the same time, the tech stack has been stagnant, as the predominant workflow for protocol development is MS Word and email. Thus, quality due to human error suffers, efficiency has clear room for improvement, and key decisions & learnings are lost from each trial. Thus, Faro aims to build digital infrastructure for smart clinical trials; its core wedge to do so is replacing flat Word documents with comprehensive data schemas that enables connection with downstream systems and iterative learning.

**Chart: Clinical Trials Industry Stack - Replacing flat text (Word documents) with comprehensive data schemas to enable connected intelligent clinical trials.**

Andy Lee, who leads clinical operations globally for Merck, gave a ringing endorsement of the initial product, which is only what Faro has developed to-date, saying "They have developed software that allows rapid assessment of clinical trial protocol procedures on cost, burden to sites, burden to patients and ease of study conduct. We have engaged on some protocol simplification work in the past month for NASH, PCSK9 and PAH. It is early days, but they are good to work with and have an evolving product that we believe will bring more efficiency to our clinical trials."

## Management Team

*   **Scott Chetham (CEO and Co-Founder):** Background as Head of Clinical Operations at Verily where he led 54 programs with leading biopharma sponsors and managed development of 100+ clinical trial protocols. Prior to that, he was a C-suite executive at Intersection Medical (acquired by Impedimed) and a Venture Partner at Versant Ventures. Scott comes with glowing reviews across the board, and is quoted as an all-star across strategy, product, commercial, and execution. We overall view Scott as an A+ leader who has a track record of meeting (and beating) key milestones he has set for the Board.
*   **Ross Jaffe (Chairman and Co-Founder):** Background as the Co-Founder and Managing Director of Versant Ventures ($4.2B AUM fund that is well respected within the life sciences ecosystem) and is a Venture Advisor at NEA. Throughout his career, Ross has led a team that has generated 76 successful exits within life sciences. He also comes with A+ reviews within our life sciences network, and we view him as an integral part of the leadership team.
*   **Paul Iter (VP of Engineering):** 20+ years experience in building early-stage startups (including Notiora, Lanyon, ACTIVE Network, ISCS, ICW Group, and Silicon Space). Paul has been a strong early-stage technology leader, and has led Faro to rarely miss product roadmap timelines, and in fact has frequently beat plans presented to the Board. However, he likely is not the long-term CTO to lead this business as it scales. We are aligned with the Board to identify the long-term CTO at the right point in time.
*   **Mark Gallagher (VP of Professional Services):** Most recently was on the leadership team at Veeva, where he managed Technical, Regulatory, Safety, Quality, and Clinical Implementation teams globally. He was responsible for Veeva's largest R&D clients and owned a $45M P&L. Mark has been instrumental as Faro has scaled their GTM efforts, both in terms of accessing Top 20 accounts and managing implementations timelines once an account has been closed.
*   **Kimberly Pospahala (VP of Commercial - Sales):** Most recently led Enterprise and CRO business segments for mHealth and RTSM at Medidata with triple-digit growth. Previously also led BD for MedAvante (ultimately acquired by WCG for $400M). While Kimberly certainly has a strong track record, she's also relatively early in her tenure. As we go forward, we will continue to evaluate if Kimberly is the right leader of the Commercial organization as the business scales (similar to Paul Iter).

### Board of Directors:

The board is comprised of Scott, Ross, Gary Swart (Polaris), Andy Harrison (Section 32), Dylan Reid (Zetta, observer), Andrea Jackson (Northpond, observer).
*   **Gary Swart:** GP at Polaris since 2014, ex-CEO of oDesk. Key deals include Quantcast, SimplyInsured, FloQast, Falkonry, Qstream, Foresight, SpineZone, Wellthy, Naked Poppy, and Novi
*   **Andy Harrison:** MD and CEO of Section 32, and ex-leadership at Google X and Verily. Key HC deals include Current Health, Freenome, Mammoth Biosciences, Oscar, and Verve

## Product Overview

### Existing Product Suite - Base Protocol Designer & Study Insights

Faro's main product offering today is its Protocol Designer tool to help develop study protocols, and is the wedge that enables future interfaces with the end-to-end clinical trial workflow. At its core, the Protocol Designer product can be thought of as an electronic intelligent notebook (e.g., Jupyter, Mathematica, Benchling) that is purpose-built for protocol design. However, it's smarter than a notebook - Faro can integrate prior data sources and assist in accelerating protocol development, integrating data regarding what worked and what didn't work in prior trials. In that regard, one can think of it as taking the manual task of drafting an S-1 and enhancing efficiency by auto-populating and modularizing the drafting task.

Within the product, the user can create comprehensive data schemas that deliver efficiency and quality improvement across all steps of the protocol development process. Sample use cases include ensuring consistent dosing across the protocol, allowing for simplified "branching" of treatment allocation, data standardization, etc,. Eventually, the base Protocol Designer tool would be expanded into a Smart Designer Tool that can handle more complex protocols. Study Insights is a module built upon this that delivers value-add use cases such as using Real World Data to inform patient availability based on inclusion/exclusion criteria, providing budgeting & study timeline implications of various protocol decisions, drivers of patient dropoff, etc. This could substantially impact study timelines, speeding enrollment and accelerating the drug's progress to market.

### Future Product Roadmap

Through 2024, Faro's product investment will be focused on two key products:
*   **Smart Hub:** Smart Hub is a "Github for Protocols," that allows for smart versioning and collaboration of protocols. Faro is currently spearheading the effort to develop community standards in tandem with the DDF Initiative. The value proposition for sponsors is multifold: (1) smart versioning allows for efficiency improvement by reducing manual labor associated with "undos” and version control issues, (2) protocol designers within a company can leverage learnings and language from past trials efficiently, vs. starting net-new each time, (3) leverage a cloud platform to enable multi-user parallel workflows, and (4) enables inter-company collaboration, allowing for permeation of best practices
*   **Open API:** Open API allows for automated programming of clinical trial software vendor systems such as eCOA, eSource / EDC, CTMS, etc. Today, trial sponsors spend sizable amounts of capital on outsourced services from Veeva/Medidate or CROs to customize these instances. Eliminating this step would reduce upfront cost to sponsors, reduce time to study start by reducing manual customization component, and reduce variability amongst software instances

Longer-term (2025+), Faro will also develop product suites across Regulatory, Commercial, and Safety that will either augment or directly compete with incumbent software vendors like Veeva and Medidata.

## Industry Landscape

### Transcelerate Context

Transcelerate is a non-profit consortium of leading biopharma companies that is focused on developing solutions to drive the efficient, effective, and high-quality delivery of novel medicines. In 2020, Transcelerate announced a Digital Data Flow (DDF) Initiative as a high-priority focus area; this initiative's core focus was to automate and connect study protocols. The DDF initiative provided a significant industry tailwind for Faro Health. In 2021, Transcelerate reviewed a set of vendors who claimed to have capabilities in this space, and Faro was told by a Transcelerate leader (Stayce Murray of UCB) that it was the first solution that matches the vision of the program. Since then, Transcelerate is lobbying every clinical trial software vendor to support a standards-based API, which Faro is co-authoring. Faro intends to continue leveraging this momentum by launching products such as Open API.

### TAM/SAM Sizing

Faro's current product offering, Study Designer, serves a segment of the market that has no direct competition (as it is currently serviced by MS Word today). Thus, the bet in the 1st phase is a "market creation" play, meaning we need to create the TAM. Currently, Faro charges ~$26,000-$35,000 per study that sponsors design with the Study Designer tool. Given there are 14,000 recruiting trials and an additional 8,000 active trials today, the TAM is estimated to be $400-800M.

The second phase of Faro's product roadmap is focused on "Study Hub" and "Open API.” Today, when trial sponsors design a study and leverage software tools like Veeva or Medidata, the sponsor must purchase outsourced services from a software vendor or CRO to customize the software instance. In the future, Faro would enable the automation of this customization, significantly reducing the need for outsourced services. For context, Veeva generates ~$200M of revenue today in R&D integration services. Assuming their services penetration is similar to that of their overall R&D software penetration (~15-20%), the TAM today for R&D integration services is $1.2B, and operates at a ~30% gross margin. If Faro is able to successfully automate this portion of the workflow, then it can access a $450M TAM, delivering a 60% cost reduction for sponsors vs. what incumbents charge today, while still generating a 80% gross margin. Longer-term (2025+), Faro hopes to also develop product suites across Regulatory, Commercial, and Safety. These products would directly go head-to-head with other clinical trial software platforms, which constitutes an overall TAM of $6B today.

### Competitive Landscape

As mentioned before, Faro has no true competitor today, and is primarily focused on disrupting the current workflow of MS Word and email communication. That being said, an array of "data standardization" vendors emerged to serve this space after the launch of Transcelerate's DDF initiative. These vendors include players such as Sycamore Informatics, Deloitte, Docuvera, Nurocor, and intelliNote. Transcelerate's initial review of these vendors indicated that while they certainly had certain capabilities to advance DDF, they lacked a comprehensive set of features, and most importantly, flexibility for the end-user. The only competitor we see certain risks from is Nurocor. We however see two clear mitigants to this risk: (1) Roche is comparing Faro head-to-head against Nurocor in a proof-of-concept study today, and directly indicated to us that the experience with Faro has been miles better than that of Nurocor, primarily due to the flexibility of their UI/UX and willingness to collaborate with Roche on the product vision, and (2) Faro is rapidly building out product through end of 2022 to address any capability gaps they have vs. Nurocor.

We do however see a minor insourcing risk that has started to gain traction. UCB's DDF sponsor who originally touted Faro as the leading vendor to address the DDF vision chose to develop an inhouse solution to tackle this problem statement. However, through our network, we have found out that UCB is seeking to reconnect with Faro to evaluate a 2023 opportunity, potentially partnering with their in-house capabilities. Similarly, Novo Nordisk has also built out an inhouse solution and uploaded their codebase to Github in an open-source fashion. We would still view Faro's product as superior as Novo Nordisk's product is not scalable to a broad set of end-users today.

### Positioning vs. Other GC Assets in Clinical Trials

Historically, we at GC have been excited the following theses within clinical trials: (1) Clinical Trial Matching to expand patient access to trials, addressing a key pain point for providers, sponsors, CROs, and patients, (2) SW across eSource, EDC, EHR, and CTMS that serves as the system of record to power clinical trials, (3) Data & Analytics for Study Design (RWE-based), and (4) End-to-End Clinical Trial Operations. Ultimately, we invested in two platforms with an end-to-end vision of transforming clinical trial operations. Vial first leveraged Site Manage Operations (SMO) to aggregate patient and provider volume to then transition into its CRO business, while simultaneously building out its product stack. In contrast, Paradigm started with Clinical Trial Matching as a wedge, will build out the remainder of the software components in the near-term, and then will finally transition into end-to-end CRO operations. Triomics in comparison will tackle a segment of the clinical trial software workflow, particularly within eSource/EDC.

In contrast, Faro occupies a segment of the market that has not been served by our portfolio to-date, but has still been a thematic focus area of ours (given their ability to leverage RWE). In steady-state, Faro will use study design as a wedge to then integrate into all aspects of the clinical trial workflow, and can serve as a critical enabler of our existing clinical trial platform companies without being competitive.

### Veeva Story

Veeva, the leading life sciences software platform today, serves as an example of what is possible from a growth, margin accretion, and stickiness standpoint. Since its IPO in October 2013, Veeva's Enterprise Value has appreciated from $4.5B to $24.6B today (5-6x growth). In the same period, revenue has grown from $130M to $2.1B (16x growth), gross margin from 55% to 75%, and EBITDA margin from 20% to 40%. Veeva Vault, its document management solution, generates ~$1B in revenue alone today; this constitutes a ~100% CAGR since 2013 and has grown to represent ~15-20% of the TAM. Furthermore, Veeva Vault exhibits particularly attractive SaaS metrics, with consistent 120%+ NRR, 96% gross retention, and magic numbers of 0.8-1.2 (high-end of benchmarks). Faro's product offering arguably creates further value creation for sponsors, allowing for insight generation on top of document management.

## Current Customers & Pipeline

Faro Health has currently closed 5 customer contracts today:
*   **Merck (Top 20):** Faro has a strong strategic relationship with Merck, and is currently in the proof-of-concept (POC) phase. After a week-long strategic session with R&D leaders at Merck HQ, Faro expects to launch POCs across 6 therapeutic areas (TAs) in 2023, eventually converting to an Enterprise License Agreement (ELA) by Q3-Q4. Feedback from Merck's Head of Clinical Operations (through Ken Frazier) has been quite positive, referencing the innovative nature of the team and unparalleled product UI/UX.
*   **Roche / Genentech (Top 20):** Faro is currently in the POC phase with Roche/Genentech, and is currently going head-to-head with Nurocor. For context, Faro was chosen as 1 of 2 after going through RFI (10 candidates) and RFP (6 candidates) processes. Based on the feedback from Roche's DDF leadership, Faro is winning against Nurocor due to its comprehensive feature set, willingness to collaborate, and most importantly, flexibility of the UI/UX to the end-user. Thus, we have reasonable confidence that Faro will be the winner if a vendor is selected. From a process standpoint, Faro will have to move through ~2-3 more trial phases before locking in a long-term ELA, which would be at the end of 2023. Note that the 2-3 trial phases would still produce revenue next-year, but would be limited in scope to the specific studies.
*   **Ionis Pharmaceuticals (Mid-Cap):** Ionis was the first closed customer contract for Faro, and has been instrumental in shaping their product roadmap. In fact, Study Insights was deliberately designed with Ionis as a pilot customer. While revenue intensity from Ionis likely pales compared to Top 20 customers, they have served as a guinea pig for Faro to develop operational maturity in hitting implementation milestones.
*   **Recursion Pharmaceuticals (Small-Cap):** For context, Recursion is a pharmaco with 4 clinical platforms across 4 TAs. After speaking with their customer champion, we learned that the primary value proposition for Recursion was to improve efficiency and consistency of protocol design, particularly given their relative inexperience in writing protocols, and handling amendments down the road.
*   **EQRx (Small-Cap):** Faro's smallest customer today, with the customer champion being in data management. Team is actively looking to enhance engagement even though they are a paying customer.

Ultimately, Faro believes that these 5 customers could represent ~$27M ARR in steady-state once ELAs are fully deployed. These 5 customers also are expected to contribute to ~89% of FY23 revenue, which derisks FY23 growth given new logo growth is not a significant driver.

Scott, in partnership with Kimberly and Mark, has built a robust pipeline of customers he is hoping to convert in 2023. Previously, Scott received feedback from several sponsors (such as UCB and Amgen) that he is simply "too early" for them to take a chance, and to revisit once he's built out the MVP and signed on several anchor customers (such as Merck and Roche). As a result, the commercial team will be focusing their efforts on re-engaging these sponsors in the coming months given they have adequately addressed feedback received. From a sales cycle standpoint, it takes an average of ~9 months from Investigation to Decision for Top 20 biopharma and ~3-8 months for SMID.

## Business Model & Financial Projections

In steady-state, Faro plans to commercialize through a standard enterprise SaaS contract (vs. pricing on individual studies) into the central budget of biopharma sponsors. This contract would be primarily composed of an annual base SaaS license fee for the Protocol Designer software, tiered by study volume of the end customer; this SaaS fee would then be expanded for additional products vended by the customer (e.g., Open API, Smart Hub, etc.). Faro would also charge a service fee for the first 12 months of implementation and ongoing support. Given the company is currently in POC phases with its major customers today, it generates revenue through per-study fees (~$26-35K) and implementation fees. Currently, Faro is actively having conversations with all existing customers to transition to an ELA structure, and is expecting conversion by the end of 2023. See below for example SaaS pricing for base Protocol Designer product by study volume tier.

In steady-state management expects the SaaS platform to operate at a 85-90% gross margin and the services business to operate at a ~30% gross margin, both of which are in-line with SaaS industry benchmarks. Note that this implies a blended ~80% gross margin, which maps to steady-state comps. At maturity, we would expect a verticalized SaaS company like Faro to operate at ~40% EBITDA margins and ~25-30% FCF margins, signifying the attractiveness of the business model.

When developing a GC Base Case, we mainly focused on a) velocity of new customer bookings, b) associated churn, and c) ramping of margin profile. For velocity of new customer bookings, we significantly pared back forward growth in Mid-Cap and Small-Cap segments given the value proposition isn't as pronounced for SMID sponsors (study collaboration value-add is predicated on internal study volume). We still retain conviction in Faro's ability to achieve success within Top 20 sponsors. Furthermore, we delayed bookings by ~3-6 months to account for slippage in implementation milestones and timing of POC phases. From a churn standpoint, we mirrored gross retention figures of Veeva (~4-5% annual churn), vs. management forecast of ~2% churn. Finally, we decreased the rate of gross margin ramp scaled and operating leverage in a more steady manner to be appropriately conservative on future cash burn. Management would say that the Series A' would provide runway through the end of 2024 before becoming profitable in 2025. In contrast, our model would suggest that the company may raise a ~$30M Series B in 2024 to provide runway through profitability. Note that Scott has had a track record of beating his BoD plan, and intentionally "sandbags" to manage expectations; to illustrate this, his internal finance target for FY2023 revenue is $7.5M (vs. $4.8M in the BoD case).

## Valuation & Returns

### Entry Valuation Benchmarking

Based on our healthcare valuation benchmarking work, we target pricing early-stage HC SaaS companies at ~18x NTM revenue to achieve a ~8-10x returns threshold, based on average growth profiles observed across our portfolio and steady-state margin profiles & valuation multiples at exit. Note that applying a ~18x NTM revenue multiple to our FY2023 GC Base Case revenue forecast of $4.1M would imply ~$74M TEV, which is in-line with our post-money valuation of ~$75M.

### Pro-Forma Cap Table

Pro-forma for the Series A' Round, General Catalyst would own ~9.3% of FDSO. Note that this assumes GC fills $7M of the $12M raise at a $60M pre-money valuation, and that the ESOP is topped-up to 8% of FDSO on a post-money basis. The largest institutional investors prior to the round include Polaris (15.3%), Zetta (15.3%), Section 32 (11.1%), and Northpond (8.6%). Scott and Ross together hold ~37% of FDSO, and the current unallocated ESOP pool constitutes ~5.0% of total capitalization.

## Public Comps

At exit, Faro Health's business model would mirror that of HC-focused verticalized SaaS companies that typically exhibit ~80% gross margins, ~40% EBITDA margins, and ~25-30% FCF margins. Given their strong FCF conversion, these businesses tend to command premium valuation multiples, which we believe should apply to Faro as well. The most direct comps are Veeva, Definitive, Doximity, and Certara; collectively, these comps trade at ~9.5x NTM Revenue. Veeva is the most direct comp in this universe, which trades at ~11.5x NTM Revenue, but we did not benchmark against Veeva given it has been the most successful Life Sciences Software growth story to date and is particularly sticky within its end-market (limiting churn risk). Note that other verticalized SaaS comps trade at an average of ~8.0x NTM Revenue; the primary drivers of valuation discount include slower growth profiles or delayed margin ramps. Thus, for the purposes of returns, we assumed Faro would exit at ~10x NTM Revenue.

Note that the referenced valuation comps are moderately correlated with forward revenue growth (see right exhibit). At exit, we estimate Faro would see ~25% NTM revenue growth. If we map this against a linear regression, our forward growth estimate would suggest a ~10.1x NTM Revenue multiple, which is in-line with our exit valuation assumptions.

Furthermore, long-dated software valuation comps imply that a ~10x NTM Revenue multiple is quite appropriate. Over the past 5 years, direct HC SaaS comps trade at ~12x NTM Revenue, whereas Other SaaS Comps trade at ~8x NTM Revenue. Overall, valuation comps have subsided from 2020-2021 highs back to long-dated averages.

## Returns Summary

For our returns analysis, we assume an EOY 2029 exit based on NTM revenue figures. Our GC Base Case for 2030 is $135M in revenue (2.2% of total $6B software R&D TAM). At a $60M pre-money valuation with ~35-40% future dilution and a 10.0x TEV / NTM Revenue multiple, this implies a 11.3x MoM / 41% IRR for GC Capital invested at the Series A'.

Note that if we sensitize our returns to pre-money valuation, we would still achieve a ~10x MoM / 40% IRR if we priced the round at a $70M pre-money valuation, which we may have to consider since the existing term sheet is also at a $60M pre-money valuation.

## Key Risks

*   **Competitive Pressure from Data Standard Vendors.** Data standard vendors such as Nurocor or Deloitte could enhance their protocol development capabilities and improve flexibility for end-users to start going head-to-head against Faro Health.
    *   **Mitigant:** Based on the Roche POC head-to-head, we already have evidence that Faro is demonstrating their differentiation vs. the data standard vendors. Faro is cited as a) having a more complete feature set, b) being more collaborative on product features, and c) having a better UI/UX which is critical for the end-user. Furthermore, Faro is actively prioritizing the buildout of key capabilities that it lacks vs. Nurocor.
*   **Length of Biopharma Sales Cycles.** Given the bureaucracy within large biopharma, Faro may see delays in ELA conversion due to the phased nature of contract cycles. The budget for an ELA contract with Faro would likely be held at the global software level, vs. at the individual program level. Thus, SaaS revenue growth may be behind plan and decreases revenue visibility given lack of long-term contracts.
    *   **Mitigant:** Veeva Vault serves as a clear example of how a software vendor has overcome the bureaucracy of the biopharma sales cycle, growing revenue from $4M in 2013 to $1B in 2021 (~100% CAGR). Veeva Vault is also allocated at the trial level, providing evidence that the budgeting issue can be circumvented. Faro is also particularly focused on meeting directly with Heads of Clin Ops (vs. individual BU or program heads) to have a more strategic conversation and lock growth across multiple TAs at once.
*   **Insourcing Risk.** UCB's DDF sponsor who originally touted Faro as the leading vendor to address the DDF vision chose to develop an inhouse solution to tackle this problem statement. Similarly, Novo Nordisk has also built out an inhouse solution and uploaded their codebase to Github in an open-source fashion. Further insourcing could continue amongst leading biopharma.
    *   **Mitigant:** Through our network, we have found out that UCB is seeking to reconnect with Faro to evaluate a 2023 opportunity, potentially partnering with their in-house capabilities, suggesting that the in-house development strategy may have proved to be too lofty for a mature biopharma company. In addition, a significant portion of the market opportunity lies within Mid-Cap customers, where the capital & time required to develop an in-house solution simply isn't the highest ROI activity.
