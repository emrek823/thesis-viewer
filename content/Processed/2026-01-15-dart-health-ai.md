She completed lumpectomy, adjuvant chemotherapy (dose-dense AC-T), and radiation therapy, followed by adjuvant endocrine therapy with letrozole. Unfortunately, she developed metastatic disease to the liver in August 2024 (18 months from initial diagnosis, 6 months after completing adjuvant therapy). Biopsy-confirmed ER+ (95%), PR+ (80%), HER2-negative (IHC 1+). She was started on first-line endocrine therapy with fulvestrant + palbociclib. Recent imaging shows progression of liver metastases with new lesions. Patient reports increased fatigue, decreased appetite, and functional decline over the past 6 weeks. She has had dose reductions of palbociclib due to cytopenias and now presents with ECOG PS decline from 1 to 2. \*\*Prior Systemic Therapy:\*\* - Adjuvant: AC-T (completed May 2023) - Adjuvant endocrine: Letrozole (May 2023 - July 2024) - First-line metastatic: Fulvestrant + Palbociclib (August 2024 - October 2025) - Best response: Stable disease (4 months) - Discontinued due to disease progression
