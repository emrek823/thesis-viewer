**What You Should Know:**

– [Philips](https://www.usa.philips.com/) has agreed to [acquire](https://hitconsultant.net/tag/healthcare-mergers-acquisitions/#.XKUWg5hKhyw) [SpectraWAVE, Inc.](https://www.spectrawave.com/), a move designed to bolster its leadership in image-guided therapy by integrating SpectraWAVE’s [AI-powered](https://hitconsultant.net/tag/artificial-intelligence/) coronary imaging and physiology assessments into the Philips Azurion platform.

– The acquisition adds critical next-generation capabilities, including DeepOCT (optical coherence tomography) and wire-free Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR), to Philips’ existing portfolio.

– The strategic expansion aims to improve outcomes for the 300 million people worldwide affecting by coronary artery disease by giving clinicians a more comprehensive, single-platform toolkit for interventions.

**Philips Bets Big on AI-Driven Cardiac Imaging with SpectraWAVE Acquisition**

In the high-stakes world of interventional cardiology, seconds matter, and image clarity is the currency of survival. Today, Royal Philips (NYSE: PHG) signaled a significant consolidation of that currency, announcing its acquisition of SpectraWAVE, Inc., a Bedford, Massachusetts-based innovator in intravascular imaging.

While financial terms remain undisclosed, the strategic intent is crystal clear: Philips is moving to lock down the coronary intervention market by plugging SpectraWAVE’s AI-driven sensing technology directly into its ubiquitous Azurion platform.

For industry watchers, this is more than a bolt-on acquisition. It represents a shift toward “multimodality” in a single setting—bringing structure, composition, and physiology data together to treat the world’s most common heart disease.

#### **Doubling Down on the Azurion Ecosystem**

Roy Jakobs, CEO of Royal Philips, described the move as “doubling down on image-guided therapy.” This is not hyperbole. Philips’ Azurion platform is already used to treat over 7.6 million patients annually across 80 countries. By acquiring SpectraWAVE, Philips is addressing a specific gap in the high-definition imaging space.

Modern percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI)—stenting clogged arteries—increasingly rely on seeing *inside* the vessel, not just looking at X-ray shadows. Philips already owns strong IVUS (intravascular ultrasound) technology. However, SpectraWAVE brings a different, complementary set of eyes: Enhanced Vascular Imaging (EVI).

This allows Philips to offer a “comprehensive clinician choice” model. Whether a doctor needs the depth penetration of ultrasound or the high-resolution surface detail of optical coherence tomography (OCT), Philips can now provide both within one integrated ecosystem.

#### **Decoding the Tech: DeepOCT and NIRS**

The jewel in this acquisition is SpectraWAVE’s HyperVue Imaging System. It combines two sophisticated technologies that have historically been fragmented:

1. **DeepOCT (Optical Coherence Tomography):** Think of this as “ultrasound with light.” It provides microscopic detail of the artery wall structure.
2. **NIRS (Near-Infrared Spectroscopy):** This analyzes the *chemical composition* of the plaque, identifying lipid-rich areas that are prone to rupture.

By combining these into a single catheter pullback with AI-automated analysis, SpectraWAVE (and now Philips) offers clinicians a rapid, detailed map of the “enemy” inside the artery. “This partnership allows us to integrate and scale HyperVue… supporting more consistent, high-quality care,” noted Eman Namati, PhD, CEO of SpectraWAVE.

#### **The Wire-Free Revolution**

Beyond imaging, the acquisition targets workflow efficiency with X1-FFR. Traditionally, measuring blood flow pressure (Fractional Flow Reserve, or FFR) required threading a specialized pressure wire into the artery—a physical intervention that takes time and costs money.

X1-FFR uses AI to calculate this pressure drop directly from the X-ray angiogram, with no wire required. This “angio-derived” physiology is a massive trend in cath labs because it reduces procedural complexity.

By adding X1-FFR alongside its existing OmniWire iFR (a wire-based technology), Philips is effectively cornering the market on physiology options. They can now offer wire-based precision for complex cases and wire-free speed for routine assessments, all guided by the same Azurion interface.
