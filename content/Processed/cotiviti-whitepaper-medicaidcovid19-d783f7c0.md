# Under pressure: How Medicaid plans can overcome the inevitable strain of COVID-19

**White paper**
**COTIVITI**

By Bonnie Phillips, Senior Vice President of Product Management

The staggering number of job losses caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to the highest unemployment rate since the Great Depression, has meant loss of income for millions of American families. But that isn't the full extent of the damage, because many of these families are also losing their employer-sponsored health insurance coverage.

Unless they can secure another job quickly, their only options for health insurance are to continue their previous coverage through COBRA, enroll in a commercial plan on the health insurance exchanges, or enroll in a Medicaid plan. But for many working-class families, especially those who have just lost income, the first two options may not be feasible. For this reason, Medicaid plans should expect a surge in new members.

This is borne out by a recent survey of 38 states conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation, which found:

*   32 expect higher Medicaid enrollment in fiscal year 2020 than originally projected
*   30 expect their Medicaid enrollment will go higher still in fiscal year 2021
*   18 expect their Medicaid spending will increase for this fiscal year relative to their original budget projections
*   29 expect their Medicaid spending will increase for fiscal year 2021 compared to this year

While recently passed coronavirus relief legislation boosted federal Medicaid matching funds by 6.2 percent to assist with this anticipated surge in enrollment, the survey found a significant number of states still project Medicaid budget shortfalls for this year and the coming year as tax revenue shrinks amid the ongoing pandemic. The enhanced matching funds also come with strict requirements to cover COVID-19 testing, treatment, and therapies—all without increasing premiums. Meanwhile, many Medicaid providers have depleted their resources and according to news reports, aren't seeing the same level of federal relief as Medicare providers.

All these factors may pose perhaps an unprecedented financial strain on Medicaid plans, which cover the sickest and most vulnerable populations and operate on thin margins even when the economy is thriving.

Therefore, it is imperative for Medicaid plan leaders to take action to contain inappropriate medical costs immediately without sacrificing the quality of care their members receive.

Here are five areas that Medicaid plans should evaluate to protect their business in this environment:

## 1: Prospective claim editing and coding validation

When health plans identify paid claim errors due to improper billing or coding, they typically recover less than 70 percent of overpayments while incurring administrative costs of $50 or more per claim. This includes overpayments related to emergency room Evaluation and Management (E&M) up-coding, a very common problem for Medicaid plans, which see higher-than-average ER usage among their populations. However, navigating a tangled web of state-specific payment policies along with complex clinical scenarios such as the use of modifiers is no easy task.

Now, more than ever, providers need claims to be paid accurately the first time. Therefore, identifying potential overpayments and ensuring payment accuracy prospectively means greater savings and lower administrative costs for Medicaid plans and their providers. Medicaid plans should look for advanced analytic solutions that seamlessly incorporate their state's specific guidelines while being supplemented by expert-driven clinical coding expertise. A partner capable of pre-payment reviews using a robust library that reconciles policy from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) with state-based guidelines is best positioned to maximize savings opportunities while ensuring strict compliance with regulations at all levels.

## 2: Fraud, waste, and abuse (FWA) prevention

The current environment is rife with potential for those seeking to game the system, and government payers are always a target. Because Medicaid patients often make up only a very small percentage of each provider's panel, health plans can be challenged in accumulating enough data to locate and confirm patterns of FWA. Even when a special investigative unit (SIU) can identify such patterns, the road to recovering those dollars can be long and costly.

By working with a partner that leverages experience across many health plans and many providers, health plans can gain access to insights they could not determine on their own and can be notified when fraudulent activity is detected across providers spanning multiple payers. In particular, Medicaid plans should supplement their existing FWA recovery solutions with advanced analytics that can identify and prevent FWA prospectively to optimize their ROI.

## 3: Coordination of benefits (COB)

As the "payer of last resort,” it is incumbent upon Medicaid plans to ensure the member does not have commercial or Medicare coverage that should be paying the claim first. However, many COB programs can only identify other health insurance coverage after the claim has already been paid—and this can involve contacting hard-to-reach Medicaid members. This process puts undue burden on resource-strapped plans as well as members themselves. Medicaid plans should look to solutions that bolster post-pay programs by also rapidly identifying and validating a portion of these other coverage scenarios before claims are paid while still meeting stringent prompt-pay requirements. Based on Cotiviti's experience, this could bump the payer's total program value by 15 percent or more while increasing efficiency.

## 4: Clinical chart validation (CCV)

Reviewing clinical charts to validate diagnoses is costly and time consuming—and all the more challenging amid COVID-19 as severely overburdened providers need time to comply with medical record requests. Health plans can also risk provider abrasion if they are not targeted in their approach. Yet it is a vital process for either preventing or reversing inappropriate payments and can drive significant savings on DRG, short stay, and readmissions spend.

Rather than request as many records as possible, Medicaid plans must take a focused, analytics-driven approach that isolates charts for claims with the highest probability of overpayment. When feasible, they should perform these chart reviews before payment while still ensuring they meet each state's unique "prompt pay" guidelines. While this does require claim payment to be “paused" briefly, it can lower provider abrasion in the long run by minimizing overpayment recoveries.

## 5: Quality measurement and reporting

High-value care is also cost-effective care, and value is becoming increasingly tied to reimbursement. But Medicaid plans face unique challenges in closing care gaps for their members, many of whom may not have a permanent address, and quality measures vary widely from state to state.

Medicaid plans need customizable quality solutions that can pinpoint where gaps are occurring and deliver rapid insights to decisionmakers so they can decide where to invest their resources for the highest likelihood of success. They also need solutions that allow them to report Medicaid measure results specific to their states.

## Navigating the path ahead

Given the complexity of state regulations, high administrative burden, and tight margins associated with Medicaid populations, managing each Medicaid claim efficiently is critical to preserving financial health. As lines of business shift as a result of COVID-19, rethinking internal processes and investing in solutions focused on ensuring pre-pay claim accuracy; anticipating patterns of fraud, waste, and abuse; and managing quality programs are all important to preserving financial and clinical outcomes as healthcare continues to shift post-pandemic. The right partner can offer not only product solutions, but also consultation and expertise to ensure your internal processes are optimized for the growing Medicaid population.

Navigating the difficulties of the COVID-19 pandemic will strain Medicaid plans for months to come, if not years. By investing in the right solutions now to improve both financial and clinical outcomes, plans will not only be in a much better position to weather the storm, but will continue to reap the benefits of improved performance when the economy recovers.

## Case study: Medicaid MCO provider billing compliance

Cotiviti identified a $3 million pattern of abusive billing for a Medicaid MCO client based on claims spanning a five-year period involving one of the MCO's largest in-network hospitals.

The hospital received $2,200 to $2,600 per claim for casting and splint applications, coding these services as if they were performed in the ambulatory surgery department. For care and treatment performed in an ambulatory surgery or operating room setting, other related charges such as anesthesia or recovery room services should be seen, yet the cast and splint applications were the only services billed on the hospital's claims.

By cross-referencing the hospital claims with the corresponding physician claims, Cotiviti's medical chart auditors confirmed the physicians who performed the related services reported that they had done so in a non-sterile clinic (i.e., office) setting. Cotiviti auditors and certified coders also performed a review of a sample set of claims, and confirmed that the records showed that these services were in fact performed in a treatment room, not an ambulatory surgery suite. These services therefore were more accurately defined by a different revenue code that was only reimbursed $200 per claim.

After identifying the inappropriate billing pattern, Cotiviti worked closely with the MCO's provider network management team to implement a corrective billing action plan and support new contractual terms to mitigate future billing errors, resulting in an estimated cost savings of up to $8 million annually.
